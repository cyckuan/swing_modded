VAUGHN'S BLUNDER COSTLY TO ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO -- If only Mo Vaughn were as good on his feet as he is
with his hands, the Angels might be onto something.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, Vaughn is not the fleetest of foot, and his lack of
footwork cost the Angels a run at a time runs were at a premium.
Because the Toronto Blue Jays scored five runs in the eighth
inning, Vaughn's baserunning blunder became a moot point in the
Angels' 7-1 loss before 13,622 at SkyDome.
</P>
<P>
   But it certainly changed the complexion of the game when it was
there for the taking.
</P>
<P>
   In the top of the sixth with the game tied at 1, Vaughn appeared
to score from second on a single to center by Garret Anderson. The
Blue Jays appealed at third, claiming Vaughn missed the base as he
came home to score. Third-base umpire Rick Reed gave the out call
and the run -- and a 2-1 lead -- was erased.
</P>
<P>
   After Anderson hit the ball to center, Vaughn looked over his
shoulder to make sure the ball would drop. That seemed to throw off
his timing, and Vaughn, who had three hits in the game, clearly
missed the base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked back ... it was just stupid, really,'' Vaughn said.
``I've been in the league 10 years. I've been around too long for
something like that to happen. We go up a run and you never know
what could happen. I have no excuses about it. It's a bad play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should have been a clear-cut play. I should have stuck my
foot in the middle of the bag. ... It's a game of momentum, a game
of swings. I'm disgusted.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed also made a key call in the fifth inning. The Angels led,
1-0, when the Blue Jays had the bases loaded with two out. Angels
starter Ramon Ortiz went into a stretch, but hesitated during the
motion and Reed called a balk. Brad Fullmer was allowed to score
from third to tie the game at 1.
</P>
<P>
   For Ortiz, the balk was his second in two starts this season. He
had two balks in nine games last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (catcher) Bengie (Molina) gave the sign I started to make
a little move,'' Ortiz said. ``I didn't wait for Bengie to finish
giving the sign.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He started up and stopped,'' manager Mike Scioscia said. ``It
wasn't part of his normal motion. Once you're in contact with the
rubber, the only thing you can do is come into your normal set and
pitch. Hey, we're dealing with a young pitcher. The bottom line is
he pitched great.''
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz gave up two runs and five hits in 5 2/3 innings, but
despite what Scioscia said, he didn't feel he threw the ball great.
</P>
<P>
   ``My control was not there today compared to last time,'' Ortiz
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think he was on his game even though he was good,
numbers-wise,'' Molina said. ``I didn't see him pitch the way he
usually pitches. His control wasn't there. Every pitch was
belt-high or down the middle. Usually he pitches on the corners.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays broke the game open in the eighth inning against
Angels relievers Mark Petkovsek and Lou Pote. Raul Mondesi led off
the inning with a home run off Petkovsek, and three batters later,
the Blue Jays had the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Pote replaced Petkovsek and gave up a grand slam to Fullmer, and
that was that.
</P>
<P>
   Despite what looks like a lopsided score, Scioscia said the game
was one that could have been won if not for the two plays and the
Angel offense's continued problems in key situations.
</P>
<P>
   They failed to score in both the first and second innings
despite putting a runner on third with less than two outs, and went
2 for 11 with runners in scoring position in the game. In their
past two games, the Angels are 4 for 24 (.167) when hitting with
runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not in position to panic,'' Scioscia said. ``You're
going to have games where you don't execute like you should. A lot
of what we had is fixable.''

ERSTAD SITS OUT WITH INJURY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO -- Darin Erstad's spectacular diving catch in Sunday's
game against the White Sox came at a price. Erstad hurt his right
shoulder making the play and missed his first game of the season
Monday vs. Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tweaked it a little bit, it's nothing major,'' said Erstad,
who began Monday leading the league in hitting (.472) and leading
the majors in hits (25). ``It's something that will take a couple
days. I don't see it as causing any problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Erstad said he didn't feel any pain when he made the catch of
Paul Konerko's liner to the left-center field gap in the seventh
inning Sunday. But late Sunday night it got sore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked about getting these guys off the turf one day or
another, so this was a good day to give him a break,'' manager Mike
Scioscia said. ``I'd be surprised if he wasn't feeling much better
(today).''
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Gary DiSarcina (bruised left thumb) began taking
groundballs Sunday and hitting soft-toss Monday.
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina, who is eligible to come off the disabled list when
the Angels return home April 24, hurt the thumb April 8 knocking
down a ball hit hard by Boston's Nomar Garciaparra. DiSarcina has
played in only five games, but has three errors and is hitting
.412.
</P>
<P>
   ``The swelling's down and the mobility's coming back,''
DiSarcina said. ``There's still slight pain, but it's pretty
managable. I think hitting's going to be tougher than fielding
groundballs because you have to squeeze the bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Derrick Turnbow made his major league debut in the
eighth inning Monday night after the Angels had fallen behind, 7-1.
He gave up a single to Marty Cordova before retiring the next three
hitters. Turnbow, 21, pitched in single-A in the Phillies'
organization last year and was acquired by the Angels in the Rule V
Draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty nervous, but when I started throwing I got a
little more relaxed,'' Turnbow said.
</P>
<P>
   It took two weeks for Turnbow to actually get into a game, but
he said he was patient along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I would (get into a game) eventually,'' he said. ``I
just wanted to be ready when I got in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was cool as a cucumber,'' Scioscia said.
</P>
<P>
   Infielder Keith Johnson, called up last week to replace
DiSarcina on the roster, also made his major league debut in the
game, replacing Mo Vaughn as a pinch-runner in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the numbers might be considered mind-boggling, but
through the first two weeks of the season, the Angels' starting
staff has been one of the best in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Monday's game, the staff's ERA of 3.01 was the best
in the majors; opposing hitters were batting .233 against them,
best in the American League and second best in the majors (Mets at
.226); the Angels had three starters among the A.L.'s top 10 in ERA
-- Scott Schoeneweis (2.35), Kent Bottenfield (2.41) and Jason
Dickson (2.77).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't put much stock in that,'' Scioscia said. ``We look for
guys to execute pitches. If they execute pitches the results will
be there. The thing about our starters has been consistency. You
hope they stay consistent all season, but there are going to be
bumps in the road. To say where they stack up against the league,
is it enough for us to win? That's what's important.''

   Matchup: Jason Dickson (1-0, 2.77 ERA) will start for Anaheim
against Toronto's Frank Castillo. The two pitchers faced each other
last Wednesday in Anaheim, but neither was involved in the
decision, a game eventually won by Toronto, 6-2. Castillo gave up
two runs in 6 2/3 innings; Dickson gave up two runs in 6 1/3
innings. With 10 home runs, the Angels have hit the fewest in the
American League.

U.S., WITH EYES ON BEIJING, DECIDES WHICH WEAPONS TO SELL TAIWAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout) 
By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a decision intended to avoid further roiling the
tensions between China and Taiwan, the Clinton administration
agreed on Monday to sell Taiwan upgraded versions of three missiles
and a long-range radar system, but not four technology-laden
destroyers.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was made on Monday at a White House meeting among
the national security adviser, Sandy Berger; Defense Secretary
William S. Cohen, and Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, and
it was relayed to Taiwan on Monday evening, Pentagon and White
House officials said.
</P>
<P>
   As details of the decision spread, senior Republicans on Capitol
Hill voiced some anger that the administration had not delivered a
more robust weapons package.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jesse Helms, the Republican of North Carolina who is
chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, pledged to seek
passage of a bill known as the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act that
would greatly strengthen military ties between Washington and
Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   How to gauge what to sell to Taiwan has become one of the most
sensitive questions for Washington's relationship with Beijing,
which has in recent months been recovering after almost a year in
the deep freeze.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are conscious this is a sensitive time, but our primary
guide is what is needed for Taiwan's security,'' said
Undersecretary of Defense Walter B. Slocombe.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the sale of weapons to Taiwan _ governed by the
1979 Taiwan Relations Act, which calls for the United States to
provide ``sufficient'' means for Taiwan to defend itself _ has been
a fairly routine affair.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, particularly after China released a policy paper
in advance of the Taiwan presidential election that toughened its
stance toward the island, the shopping list from Taiwan was among
the most sensitive. China, which regards Taiwan as a renegade
province and has long refused to rule out military action to block
Taiwan's formal independence, warned in the paper that putting off
serious talks on reunification could be grounds for war.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing had repeatedly told Washington in recent months that
selling four Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, equipped with the
Aegis battle-management system, would be ``unacceptable.'' China
views such a sale as tantamount to endowing Taiwan with a system to
defend against ``theater missiles,'' a move it has consistently
opposed.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official called the weapons package a
judicious response to Beijing's military threat to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue is the increasing investment Beijing has put in
its offensive capability against Taiwan,'' the official said. ``And
to the extent that Beijing has fired missiles around Taiwan and is
adding 50 missiles a year to its arsenal, that increases what we
have to do to provide adequate countermeasures.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Republicans in Congress led by Sen. Trent Lott of
Mississippi, in whose district the destroyers are built, have
threatened to move more swiftly on the security enhancement bill if
the administration does not proceed with the destroyers. The White
House has said it will veto the bill, which the House has passed.
</P>
<P>
   Also at stake is legislation that would give China permanent
normal trading relations with the United States, a pivotal element
if American businesses are to benefit from China's requested
membership in the World Trade Organization. The White House is in a
tight battle with Congress over passage of the trade legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The package falls in three categories _ missiles that Taiwan has
requested but that Washington declined to sell, a long-range radar
system that was promised last year and whose precise character is
to be determined and a study of Taiwan's naval needs. Pentagon
officials said on Monday night that the study would not rule out a
reconsideration of the Aegis destroyers, which are mounted with
missiles and radars that can track up to 100 targets
simultaneously. The ships ost $1 billion each.
</P>
<P>
   The missiles to be sold to Taiwan include advanced medium-range
air-to-air missiles, which are to be stored in the United States.
If China acquired a similar missile like the Russian-made AAX-12,
the medium-range missiles would be moved to Taiwan, a Pentagon
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Another missile to be sold is an upgraded version of the
Maverick air-to-ground missile, guided by an infrared sensor. The
third is the Javelin antitank weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Probably most objectionable to Beijing is the long-range radar,
Pave Paws. A senior Pentagon official said ``exact details'' were
to be worked out on what would be the best model to give early
warning for long-range missile launchings, as well as incoming
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The long-range radar would be ``geared to the threat which we
expect to be up a few years out'' in China, the Pentagon official
said.
</P>
<P>
   The most sophisticated version of Pave Paws can track missiles
3,000 miles away. But it is far from clear that this is the model
contemplated for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   China has deployed in its eastern areas 200 ballistic missiles
against Taiwan and is adding 50 a year, according to Adm. Dennis
Blair, commander in chief of U.S. forces in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech last month, Blair characterized those missiles as
``terror weapons _ too inaccurate to hit military targets with any
confidence'' but able to post a military threat to Taiwan as their
numbers increase and their accuracy improves.
</P>
<P>
   In deciding on the weapons package, the Pentagon, whose
officials had been suggesting that they proceed ahead with the
Aegis ships, finally acknowledged that such a move would be too
provocative, a senior administration official said. ``The Pentagon
looked around and found they had underestimated what the Chinese
reaction would be,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy here said his government was
``particularly concerned that Washington was selling advanced
weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Any American arms sales at this time,'' said the spokesman,
Zhang Juanjuan, ``might be viewed by the pro-independence people in
Taiwan as open support.''

``Sure, but I'll need 1,000 pages and 10 years to do it.'' That,

writes about his love as a young child for the beautiful woman who
gave birth to him, and the sadness of his estrangement from her as

determined, tenacious, sometimes violent woman who was, her

   This is a terrific first novel that will appeal to readers who
loved Charles Frazier's 1997 book, (beginitalic)Cold Mountain.
(enditalic)You might even think they're the same story for a while,
because Lent's hero, like Frazier's, is a soldier making his way
home at the end of the Civil War. But Lent's Norman Pelham reaches
his family's farm in Vermont quickly and without trauma, and he
brings a woman with him. Her name is Leah, and she is a runaway
slave who helped Norman when she found him wounded in Virginia.
Lent's novel tells three stories: that of Norman and Leah, their
marriage and family and the making of their successful farm; that
of their troubled son, Jamie, a bootlegger during the years of
Prohibition; and that of Jamie's sweet-tempered boy, Foster, who
travels into the South to uncover the secret that eventually
destroyed his grandmother's life with Norman and their children.
There's violence, romance and poetic prose here, from a writer who
shows remarkable talent. Enjoy.

   During filming, studio censors suggested, laughably, that
``either Karen or Warden put on a beach robe or some other type of
clothing before they go into the embrace.'' Karen was Deborah Kerr,
Warden was Burt Lancaster, and the beach robe was notably absent
from their surf-jostled kiss in (beginitalic)From Here to
Eternity(enditalic). Lancaster, Buford says, ``blends into our
collective memory like a famous uncle who was once a great
athlete.'' Throughout his life, he was a study in contradiction.
Known for his rages, promiscuity and mood swings, he also was
capable of great kindness and loyalty. In his youth, he was one of
Hollywood's most macho stars, yet the town simmered with rumors of
his bisexuality. And his movies were both provocative
((beginitalic)Atlantic City(enditalic)) and vapid
((beginitalic)Airport(enditalic)). Most of all, he was known for
his physical presence - his strength, his beauty, his sexuality.

<P>
   (Viking, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   Your mind will wander as you read this, and who's to say that's
not what it's supposed to do? Solnit offers a history of walking,
in which meandering, both mental and physical, is part of the
exercise. As Jean-Jacques Rousseau said, ``I can only meditate when
I am walking. When I stop, I cease to think; my mind only works
with my legs.'' Or, as Solnit writes, ``Walking is a state in which
the mind, the body and the world are aligned, as though they were
three characters finally in conversation together, three notes
suddenly making a chord.'' She discusses how walking touches many
fields - anatomy, gardening, anthropology, architecture, geography,
history, literature, philosophy, sexuality, religious studies.
This, of course, gives her license to talk about everything and
everyone, from the street sense of Charles Dickens to the poetry of
Gary Snyder to the role of walking in courtship, protest and
emancipation. Best of all, this is a book that encourages you to
put it down, and go for a walk of your own.

YANKEES PREVAIL OVER RANGERS, 5-4 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ If John Wetteland blows a save, that's
significant. When Mariano Rivera fails to hold a lead, that's
incredible. But when Wetteland and Rivera, arguably the two best
closers in the American League, both blunder in the same game, it's
bound to be a night made for the truly bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   Before Wetteland or Rivera entered Monday night's game, the
Rangers' Darren Oliver held the Yankees hitless for six and a third
innings and David Cone pitched seven effective innings for the
Yankees. After Wetteland and Rivera contributed to four lead
changes, Tino Martinez singled home the go-ahead run in the
Yankees' 11th, two innings after he had tied the game with a hit
off Wetteland, and the Yankees finally prevailed, 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who escaped a bases-loaded, no-outs jam in the
11th, have won six straight over all and have a 25-11 record
against the Rangers since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver didn't allow a hit until Paul O'Neill's single in the
seventh, just before Bernie Williams ripped a two-run homer that
tied the score at 2-all. The Rangers' Rafael Palmeiro blistered a
home run to right-center for Texas off Mike Stanton with two out in
the bottom of the eighth, and Oliver, who didn't allow a hit until
the seventh inning, remained in the Texas dugout, wearing a
blue-and-red Rangers' jacket, clapping.
</P>
<P>
   But there had to be some doubt in Oliver's mind, and in
Wetteland's.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Wetteland had tried and failed to protect a 1-0 lead
against Cleveland in the bottom of the ninth, allowing back-to-back
homers to Manny Ramirez and Jim Thome _ his first blown save in 19
chances.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had two hits in the first eight innings, and yet
they began picking at Wetteland immediately. Chuck Knoblauch
smacked a single, and one out later, O'Neill laced a hit, as well,
Knoblauch stopping at second.
</P>
<P>
   When Williams whiffed, there were two outs. But after Wetteland
could not overpower Martinez with high fastballs _ Martinez kept
fouling them back _ he tried a curve and Martinez lined it over the
head of the first baseman, scoring Knoblauch with the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera shut out the Rangers in the ninth, and Jorge Posada led
off the top of the 10th against Tim Crabtree with a long, high home
run to straightaway center field. Posada ambled around the bases as
Crabtree stared, stunned. Rivera went out to pitch the bottom of
the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Royce Clayton singled, however, moved to second on a sacrifice
bunt, and after Rivera jumped ahead in the count no balls and two
strikes against Ivan Rodriguez, Rivera tried to get Rodriguez to
chase after high fastballs. The count went to 3-2, Rivera relented
and threw a pitch over the plate, and Rodriguez singled through the
middle, tying the game again, at 4-4.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter singled to start the 11th inning, and after Mike
Venafro relieved Crabtree, O'Neill walked and Williams lined to
center. Jeter tagged up and moved to third, scoring from there when
Martinez ripped a single to right.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the game, with Oliver pitching, the Yankees hitters
kept glaring in disbelief at the home-plate umpire, Jeff Kellogg,
as if Kellogg was responsible for what Oliver was doing to them.
Derek Jeter muttered over his shoulder at the umpire as he walked
back to the dugout. Chuck Knoblauch turned to Kellogg and sneered,
as if to say, You've got to be kidding me.
</P>
<P>
   What the Yankees probably could not grasp was reality. Oliver, a
journeyman left-hander who barely got through five innings at
Yankee Stadium last week, was dominating them. A 29-year-old
pitcher who averaged about eight victories per year in his seven
seasons was shutting them out. Oliver had an earned run average of
7.45 in his first two starts, and incredibly, the Yankees had no
hits after six innings.
</P>
<P>
   In the context of this one night, there was nothing flukish.
Oliver has extraordinary control with his fastball, pitching to
corners, and when the Yankees hitters tried to anticipate this
pitch, Oliver would cock his wrist and snap a curveball, and the
swings would be awkward, off-balance.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Kelly and Clay Bellinger rolled ground balls to
shortstop for the first and second outs of the sixth inning, and
with the count two balls and two strikes on Knoblauch, Oliver
dropped over a curve in the strike zone that Knoblauch merely
observed. Oliver had 18 of the 27 outs required for a no-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter led off the seventh, swung at Oliver's first pitch and
like so many Yankees before him, grounded weakly, to second base.
Eight outs to go. But when Oliver tried jamming O'Neill with a
fastball, O`Neill muscled a looper over the head of the shortstop
Clayton, a cheap hit gladly embraced by the Yankees. Fans stood and
cheered for Oliver, the eighth pitcher in the Rangers' 29-year
history to take a no-hitter past the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   When pitchers lose no-hitters, some member of the infield will
often stroll to the mound to settle his teammate, to make sure he
is not overwhelmed by disappointment. There was no such meeting
before Williams stepped in to hit. Nobody checked on Oliver before
Williams smashed a two-run homer off the screen attached to the
left-field foul pole.
</P>
<P>
   The score was 2-2, it was the seventh inning and it did not
matter how many hits Oliver had allowed to that point.

MARKET ROLLER COASTER CAN BE MANAGED WITH SOME STRATEGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK DAVIS  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Practically everyone
in the stock market got beat up last week. Monday's rally made it
easier to answer the bell again.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But there ought to be a lesson in the bruises. Is there a way to
tell whether you're overexposed to the volatile stock market? More
importantly, what should you do if you are?
</P>
<P>
   Financial planners said they don't have easy answers to the
first question. And although they offered a few tips and
benchmarks, they agreed that each individual has his or her own
threshold for financial pain.
</P>
<P>
   Investments shouldn't cost you sleep or push you into checking
mutual fund prices every day, the planners said.
</P>
<P>
   But some people likely found last week's pummeling too severe.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not rare, and someone shouldn't be embarrassed by
recognizing that,'' said Sheryl Garrett, president of Garrett
Financial Planning Inc. in Overland Park, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   The worst damage came from the record 25 percent, one-week
plunge in the Nasdaq stock market. Friday's descent left the Nasdaq
where it had stood last November. Even the blue-chip Dow Jones
industrial average fell 7.3 percent last week, most of it coming in
Friday's 617-point dive.
</P>
<P>
   Investors got some of that back Monday as they hunted for
bargains, especially among big-name technology stocks. Both indexes
climbed more than 200 points, with the Dow Jones gaining 2.7
percent and the Nasdaq 6.6 percent. It was the Nasdaq's
second-largest one-day percent jump ever.
</P>
<P>
   Still, both indexes remain below where they started the year.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the broad decline in stocks means just about all
investors have less exposure than they did even a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the opposite is true, too. The big run-up in technology
stocks this winter means investors who haven't looked lately
probably have far more invested in tech than they originally
intended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody ought to have a good handle on how much technology
they own,'' said Wayne A. Starr, a principal at BKD Investment
Advisors LLC in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual fund investors are particularly vulnerable to owning more
technology stocks than they expect. Many so-called growth funds
favor technology stocks, but their fund names don't suggest it.
</P>
<P>
   More than one planner suggested using the mutual fund reports
from Morningstar Inc., which are available at most public
libraries. You also can visit www.morningstar.com to check your
funds' exposure to technology.
</P>
<P>
   But how much is too much?
</P>
<P>
   About one third of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index is made up of
technology stocks. Some planners said that's a reasonable benchmark
for individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett said most growth funds are likely to provide enough
exposure without seeking out technology specifically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think the majority of people need to buy a
mutual fund with technology in its name,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of how much technology you own, last week's market
was a good test of most investors' risk tolerance. And planners
were in agreement on what to do if you failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't stomach the volatility and you can't stomach the
risk...then you should back off,'' said Bill Hoeschele of Wm. F.
Hoeschele &AMP; Associates in Lenexa &QL;  Kan.
</P>
<P>
   That means sell at least some of your stocks or stock funds,
even at these sharply lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   Just because you made it through last week's damage doesn't mean
the ride is over. Investors who got a wake-up call from the stock
market this time might be struck even harder in the next round.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is the sudden realization, then reality may be better
faced now than later on,'' said Bud Kasper, president of Financial
Security Investment Advisors Inc. in Lee's Summit.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who stick with their long-term plans simply will have
to put up with more volatility.
</P>
<P>
   Even before last week's plunge in the Nasdaq, Prudential
Securities market commentator Greg A. Smith wrote that ``...an
important lesson may be that high volatility is now a way of life.
We will all have to become more accustomed to it, I believe, if we
are to continue to be investors in the U.S. market.''
</P>
<P>
   Some stocks certainly are less volatile than technology stocks.
Investors can look for stocks that pay dividends, earning part of
their rewards through income rather than rising stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   Several kinds of mutual funds try to take a less risky approach.
These include balanced funds and asset allocation funds that invest
in a mix of stocks and bonds or cash investments, and value funds
that look for out-of-favor stocks that should suffer less in market
downturns.
</P>
<P>
   Planners routinely recommend stocks for clients' retirement,
college and other long-term financing goals, because the equity
market historically has offered the best potential for gains.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, even fleeing the stock market won't insulate you from
volatility. Starr points out that bonds bled investors' pockets
last year after stuffing them with quick gains late in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do you hide from it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There is one spot. Bank certificates of deposit are federally
insured up to $100,000. And, with some five-year CDs paying 7
percent, Hoeschele said it's not a bad deal. Especially for folks
who don't have the patience to ride out the short-term peaks and
valleys on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some people who shouldn't even be in the stock
market,'' Hoeschele said.

 OSHA's PROPOSED ERGONOMICS RULES PROVOKE NATIONAL DEBATE  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Ergonomics has
catapulted from quiet science to political hot potato.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ergonomics is the adaptation of furniture, equipment, systems
and work procedures to fit the physical abilities of people who use
them. Not too long ago, the discipline elicited only sporadic
occupational safety discussions in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   This year, ergonomics _ and the extent of employers'
responsibilities to provide ergonomically correct work environments
_ morphed into a raging national debate that emphasizes money as
well as muscles.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is hundreds of pages of proposed ergonomics rules and
explanations from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
that Congress may vote on before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, OSHA's fourth attempt to set national ergonomics
standards, would apply to between 1.6 million and 5.5 million work
sites, depending on who's doing the estimating. The standards are
aimed particularly at manufacturing operations that rely on
repetitive manual labor, but would seep into all kinds of
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   The standards would require employee training, analysis of job
hazards, the provision of proper equipment and procedures, and
medical management of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say compliance would cost American businesses billions
of dollars. (The National Association of Manufacturers estimates
implementation costs at $8 billion to $18 billion). Critics also
contend that oppressive government regulation would creep into
office cubicles everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say setting tougher ergonomic standards won't cost
business, but will pay financial and productivity dividends in
terms of fewer on-the-job injuries, insurance claims and lost work
days. OSHA projects $9 billion in savings a year because of fewer
worker injuries and insurance claims.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed standards are the subject of nine weeks of public
hearings that began March 13 in Washington; continued through last
week in Chicago; move to Portland, Ore., next week; and conclude
back in Washington by May 12.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome of the hearings and legislative process,
The Center for the Study of American Business at Washington
University in St. Louis already has labeled the ergonomics issue
``the new millennium's first major regulatory confrontation between
government and business.''
</P>
<P>
   OSHA, which hired its first ergonomist in 1979, has been
studying ergonomics since then. It initiated training courses,
pilot programs and directives throughout the 1980s. In the 1990s,
the agency stepped up its public education efforts. This marks its
fourth attempt to initiate national ergonomic standards to reduce
the severity of work-related musculoskeletal disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Known as MSDs, these injuries include carpal tunnel syndrome and
other strains and sprains caused by overuse and misuse of the human
body. Such injuries often are referred to as RSIs, repetitive
stress injuries, or CTDs, cumulative trauma disorders. The
commonality is the repetitive motion, such as typing or hammering
or lifting, thought to cause the injury.
</P>
<P>
   Without government regulation, many businesses have for years
implemented ergonomic training programs, bought ergonomically
designed furniture and hired ergonomic specialists to re-evaluate
and redesign machinery and processes.
</P>
<P>
   The United Auto Workers, for example, says ergonomics programs
in place at the Big Three automakers go far beyond the OSHA
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Existing ergonomics efforts have reduced the number of
work-related MSDs reported in 1992 _ 750,000 _ to fewer than
600,000 in 1997, the latest year for which statistics are
available.
</P>
<P>
   Other industries and companies, though, have ignored or provided
only spot treatment for complainers, and that's one of the reasons
for OSHA's regulatory proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Most everyone involved in the ergonomic debate agrees a
reduction in workplace injuries will occur with proper training,
equipment and procedures. The sticking point is whether those
implementations should be voluntary or mandated and at what point
government should have the right to mandate.
</P>
<P>
   Ground zero in the debate is OSHA's ``single-trigger incident''
proposal. Here's what's causing the flap:
</P>
<P>
   OSHA would require employers in manual handling and
manufacturing operations to implement ergonomics programs, but the
standards could be ``triggered'' in any workplace (with the
exception of those in the agriculture, maritime and construction
industries, which are specifically exempted from the current
proposal) if even one MSD is reported.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, one administrative assistant complaining of
carpal tunnel syndrome in one wrist could trigger OSHA oversight
and mandate a companywide ergonomics program.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals do, however, provide some ways to get around the
``one strike, you're out'' threat. A company that already has an
approved ergonomics program in place could be grandfathered in as
compliant.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a ``quick-fix option'' that would pre-empt a
full-scale OSHA program if the employer provides immediate care for
an injured worker and eliminates the injury-causing hazard within
90 days.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the record-keeping requirements and threat of
regulatory oversight has even the most ergonomically sensitive
companies quaking.
</P>
<P>
   A major Kansas City employer, which even brings hand therapists
on site to help workers prevent and treat work-related injuries as
part of an impressive ergonomics program, asked not to be named in
this story to avoid drawing OSHA's attention.
</P>
<P>
   Another politically active, midsize Kansas City company, which
has written letters to OSHA stating its position, also asked for
anonymity in the newspaper _ saying the less attention, the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one problem you'll find is that a lot of companies are
reluctant to talk about it because there's always an issue of
whether you've gone far enough,'' noted Rick Morefield, a lawyer
who defends employers in workers' compensation cases.
</P>
<P>
   There are other reasons even ergonomically conscientious
companies and organizations oppose the proposals, especially an
OSHA provision that would require ``light duty'' assignments for
injured workers for six months at full pay.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, they say, existing workers' compensation systems,
which provide fair assessments, compensation and return-to-work
guidelines for injured workers, would be threatened or decimated by
the ergonomics proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another sticking point is the presumption that a reported
MSD is caused by work and not some extracurricular activity.
Critics say there simply isn't enough protection for employers and
insurance companies against fraudulent injury claims by workers.
</P>
<P>
   They say, for example, that a back injury from changing a tire
in the driveway could be passed off as a work-related injury
accrued from the lifting requirements of the job.
</P>
<P>
   And there's also some contention about whether there's even a
provable relationship between work and MSDs. Several trade
organizations and corporations that have banded together to fight
the OSHA proposals want the National Academy of Sciences to
complete a study of the effectiveness of ergonomics programs before
standards are implemented.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say that such a delay would be inexcusable and that
there's no doubt of the cause-and-effect relationship between
repetitive motion and injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any delay is outrageous,'' said Neal Taslitz, executive
director of the National RSI Foundation. ``There is an epidemic of
people injured at work, including those who think working at a
keyboard is so innocuous. We can't afford to wait more years.''
</P>
<P>
   Taslitz says OSHA opponents are wrong to focus on the
possibility of fraudulent claims by making workers more aware of
ergonomic principles.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every fraud case, there are about 10 cases where claims
for workers' comp or ADA (Americans With Disabilities Act)
violations are never made because people don't know the symptoms
they feel at night are related to what they do during the day,''
Taslitz said. ``Too many people are living with their injuries
until it's too late to file a claim or get recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as is often the case when proposed regulations threaten to
dig deeply into corporate pockets, the talk turns to money. John B.
Boyd, a workers' comp lawyer and former workers' comp
administrative law judge, noted the push-pull of any comprehensive
ergonomics program:
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to save costs, you should focus on workplace
safety. But invariably, you meet with a lot of resistance.
Unfortunately, the last thing an employer wants to do is spend
money up front to avoid spending money later on.''

   With Passover beginning Wednesday, there's no better time to
check in with Kosherfinder, a site that celebrates all things
Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   The opening page includes links to a special Passover report,
and also features sections on health and nutrition, wine, kosher
dishes, books, colleges and dispatches from Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the ``on campus'' features notes that this summer,
20 Dartmouth students will be participating in ``Israel 2000,'' a
program that allows Jewish college students who have never been to
Israel to visit the Jewish Holy Land for free.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the news section led off with a British court ruling
against historian David Irving, who challenged the scope of the
Holocaust. Irving had sued an American scholar for libel, claiming
she had labeled him a ``Holocaust denier.'' In ruling against
Irving, a British judge labeled him ``anti-Semitic and racist.''
</P>
<P>
   The Passover section is especially interesting, even for the
uninitiated. It explains the origin of the Jewish holiday, the
significance of the Seder plate and how to prepare for Passover,
among other things.
</P>
<P>
   The recipe section (known alternately as ``Kosher Classics'' and
``Bubbie's Kitchen''), offers Passover specialties, such as
cauliflower kugel with mushrooms.

it rich investing in Internet stocks or somesuch and immediately
plunge into depression. Apparently, psychiatrists solve the problem
by charging outrageous fees and siphoning off some of that

   It's only like a page long, but Chris Harris' takeoff on the
Census (an ersatz letter written by Census director Kenneth
Prewitt) is one long belly laugh. A few samples: ``We have been
accused of undercounting certain segments of the population. This
is simply not true, and we think all three of our nation's Native
Americans will back us up on this.'' Or, ``Moreover, although there
are no problems with the Census, we are constantly making
improvements to correct those problems.'' There is an interesting
piece on the Russian mob in America, noting FBI warnings that the
so-called ``Mafiya'' could soon become the No.1 criminal
organization in the U.S. Finally, an explanation for the popularity
of Yakov Smirnoff. A well-done piece on obsessive-compulsive
disorder questions whether it's such a great idea to drown the
``doubting disease'' in an ocean of Prozac.

   TRUE WEST
</P>
<P>
   This fun little mag , published in Cave Creek, devotes itself to
debunking some of the myths of the Old West perpetuated by
Hollywood. For example, John Wayne didn't really die in
(beginitalic)The Cowboys(enditalic). So you can stop being so mad
at Bruce Dern. Seriously, this month's issue notes that not all
cowboys carried Colt Peacemakers. Some, including notorious outlaws
Frank and Jesse James, were more partial to Remington revolvers.
Also, Wild Bill Hickok and Calamity Jane were not lovers, despite
what the supermarket tabloids said. There is also an interesting
piece on Western ``stock actors,'' who traveled from town to town
performing in different plays, making the grandiose sum of $8 per
week. The most famous stock performer may be John Wilkes Booth,
Lincoln's assassin.
</P>
<P>
   VANITY FAIR
</P>
<P>
   There is the usual Hollywood feature, this time on flaky cover
girl Kim Basinger, the Janie one-note actress who is always being
compared to someone who was a lot better. In this case, it's
Marilyn Monroe. Puh-lease. We get to hear about her angst over
being famous, beautiful and married to hunk movie star Alec
Baldwin. It's a heavy load to bear. Searching for more fluff? The
magazine doesn't disappoint, posing Sarah Ferguson in a blazer and
fishnet stockings for a Q&AMP;A. On the serious side, there is a book
excerpt on the real-life maritime disaster that inspired Melville
to write (beginitalic)Moby-Dick(enditalic): the 1820 sinking of the
Nantucket whaler, (beginitalic)Essex, (enditalic)by a rogue sperm
whale. Historian Nathaniel Philbrick draws on newly discovered
documents to weave the tale of the crew, who were driven to near
madness after being set adrift in the Pacific.

U.S. SUPREME COURT TO HEAR MISSOURI BALLOT-WORDING CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Supreme Court will
decide whether Missouri election ballots can list the views
congressional candidates have on term limits.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The court announced Monday it would review a lower court ruling
that struck down a 1996 Missouri constitutional amendment to
designate term limit positions so voters could see how candidates
stood on the issue. Courts have struck down similar measures in
nine states.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a shocker,'' said Arthur A. Benson II, a Kansas City,
Mo., lawyer who represents a former candidate for Congress who
challenged the amendment. ``It seems unusual the Supreme Court
would take a case where there were no conflicts among'' other
courts.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Missouri attorney general argued in briefs to
the high court that the case should be heard, although the
arguments wouldn't come in time to affect the 2000 election. At
least four of the nine justices must agree to hear a case, but
votes are not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's appropriate for the Supreme Court to revisit this
issue,'' Attorney General Jay Nixon said Monday. ``It is important
to look at the broader issues here. I don't think the court took
this case to decide wording in this one case.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon said the question revolves around how much information
states are allowed to give voters about candidates and issues. For
instance, candidates are listed as Democrat and Republican and
there often are long explanations of ballot issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's an appropriate function of a state to determine
the composition of its ballot,'' Nixon said. ``Giving voters more
information has not been dangerous to democracy in the past and I
don't expect it to be in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Voters passed the state amendment by a 58 percent margin in the
November 1996 general election. It sought to have members of the
congressional delegation enact term limits of 12 years in the
Senate and six years in the House.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment also would require incumbents to show they had
supported term limits, otherwise the ballot would say they
``disregarded voters' instructions.'' Non-incumbents who do not
back term limits would have it noted on the ballot that they
``declined to pledge support for term limits.''
</P>
<P>
   A challenge to the amendment was posed by Donald Gralike, a
former state legislator from St. Louis who ran for U.S. House in
1998 as a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 31, 1999, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St.
Louis ruled that putting term limit views on a ballot was
unconstitutional because it required candidates to back the limits
or have a ``derogatory'' label attached to their names.
</P>
<P>
   ``It compels speech, which is a violation of free speech by
forcing elected representatives and candidates to make declarations
and say things,'' Benson said Monday. ``Government should have no
role in enforcing speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Benson said letting views on term limits go on a ballot could
set a precedent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why just this issue?'' he said. ``Why not abortion, gun
control? Where does the list of issues end that could be put on a
ballot?''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon said he understood the concern about a precedent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are potential practical problems, that's why the
legislature and the people are vested with authority on ballot
measures like this,'' Nixon said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the U.S. Supreme Court hurt the term limit movement by
ruling that voters in individual states could not decide whether to
limit terms of the members of Congress. Only a federal
constitutional amendment could achieve that purpose, it ruled.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, term limit advocates in Missouri and elsewhere
looked for other ways to bring about term limits, including
electing candidates who favored the limits and would back them in a
federal constitutional amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the justices Monday is the second time in recent
months that a voter initiative in Missouri has come before the
court. Earlier this year the court upheld limits Missouri voters
placed on what individuals can contribute to state legislative
candidates.

IT'S UNANIMOUS; BASEBALL OWNERS APPROVE DAVID GLASS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE ROCK  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   HOUSTON _ The final vote lasted, in the
words of baseball commissioner Bud Selig, ``about 40 seconds.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   And just like that, after years of instability that plagued the
Royals in both the standings and the stands, the ownership drought
of Kansas City's baseball team effectively ended on Monday. The
full group of baseball's owners, voting unanimously, approved David
Glass as the next owner of the Kansas City Royals.
</P>
<P>
   That marked the last significant step in Glass' pursuit of
ownership, a maneuver that, as expected, proved to be little more
than a formality.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals and Glass hope to close the legal transaction, at the
agreed-upon price of $96 million, before the end of the month. Once
that happens, Kansas City will have a permanent owner in place for
the first time since Ewing M. Kauffman died in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about it,'' Glass said after the meeting, only a
slight smile forming on his face. ``I may not look excited, but I
am.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great day. I've waited for this day for a long time.
I'm really excited about the way it's turned out.''
</P>
<P>
   And baseball's owners wasted no time in formally approving
Glass. Meeting at the posh Four Seasons Hotel in downtown Houston,
they originally planned to gather for two days. The first order of
business was to discuss Glass' proposal. Drayton McLane, the owner
of the Houston Astros and one of Glass' good friends, made the
formal recommendation that the owners approve Glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loves the game, and he understands the game,'' McLane said
after the meeting. ``He'll make an outstanding owner.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no objections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go into the meeting,'' Glass said, ``and it's over five
minutes later.''
</P>
<P>
   The owners hustled through the rest of the agenda, adjourning
shortly after 7:30 p.m. Monday. Glass and team president Mike
Herman headed from there to Houston's new baseball stadium, Enron
Field, to celebrate the latest development.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been waiting seven years for this,'' Herman said. ``This
is great.''
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't exactly shocking, not for a man who has worked
with the league owners since 1993 and was a known quantity within
baseball's political circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody respects David Glass a great deal because of his
business acumen, because of his intelligence,'' said Jerry
Colangelo, chairman of the Arizona Diamondbacks. ``He is
well-respected in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very positive move, both for baseball and for Kansas
City.''
</P>
<P>
   The transaction won't be finalized until near the end of the
month, Herman said. The two sides have to navigate a maze of legal
paperwork, and the Royals board has to meet again and approve the
final sale.
</P>
<P>
   Once that happens, Glass expects few immediate changes in the
day-to-day operation of the club.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he will see to it only that son Dan takes on a more
active role with the team.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Glass worked in the front office for about five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'd like to do,'' David Glass said, ``is get him in there
and let him learn the areas that he hasn't been in yet before he
has to pick up a lot of responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Glass' exact role with the club, and his title, hasn't been
determined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited,'' said Dan Glass, who was at the meeting in
Houston. ``And I'm excited for him. This is his baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll just do whatever he asks me to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's development marked the conclusion of a journey that has
dragged on for years. There have been countless hurdles along the
way, things like an unwieldy 26-month review by the IRS to approve
Kauffman's intricate succession plan. There was the auction that
Glass abandoned in 1997, the one in which he was convinced that
Royals fans didn't support him. There was the lengthy Miles
Prentice flirtation, the one that saw Prentice win the endorsement
of the Royals board of directors but ultimately get rejected by
this same group of owners.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the team went to the very person that Kauffman
originally hoped it would.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thrilled,'' said Julia Irene Kauffman, Ewing Kauffman's
daughter and a member of the Royals board of directors. ``David
Glass is the right owner for Kansas City fans and for this team.''
</P>
<P>
   There haven't been many baseball owners in this town, a city
that was spoiled by Kauffman's generous pockets. Others have tried,
people like Prentice and Avron Fogelman, but only Glass had the
financial and political clout to pull it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very, very happy day for me personally, for Major
League Baseball, for baseball in Kansas City,'' Selig said. ``Ewing
Kauffman took me under his wing back in 1969. I felt a special
responsibility, all through this process, to make sure it came out
as close to the Ewing Kauffman mold as we could ever do. I really
feel a sense of fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, somewhere...Ewing Kauffman is happy. I know he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a permanency, a long-time stability that's very, very
important. I'm very proud of the club. I'm happy for the fans in
Kansas City, who deserve stability and deserve the kind of owner
they got. And, in my judgment, they got the best.''

JACKSON DIPLOMATIC ABOUT POTENTIAL CONFLICT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Among the Kings fans watching on television
Saturday was Lakers coach Phil Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Kings, Lakers and Clippers have pretty much lived
harmoniously in the new arena, this is playoff time and scheduled
dates are precious for the teams involved.
</P>
<P>
   Does Jackson hope the Kings force a Game 6 with the Red Wings
scheduled for Sunday at Staples Center?
</P>
<P>
   That's Easter Sunday, the day NBC and the Lakers hope to play
Game 1 of their first-round series against the loser of tonight's
game between Seattle and Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA playoffs begin Saturday, but the Lakers would love to
get an extra day's rest. Jackson wasn't biting when asked if he
hopes the Kings series is over by Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm rooting for the Kings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kings coach Andy Murray was pleased to hear his Staples neighbor
was keeping tabs on his team. Murray, who sometimes watches up to
eight NHL games a night off the satellite at home in Hermosa Beach,
also follows the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watch their games, too,'' he said Monday. ``Of course, I've
probably seen more of their games than he's seen of ours.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings opened their first-round series with the Red Wings on
Thursday in Detroit instead of Wednesday so they would not play
Sunday at home, a conflict with the Lakers game against Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   After that game, the Red Wings' Chris Chelios and the Lakers'
Ron Harper, old friends from their days in Chicago, visited in the
Lakers dressing room.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing for granted: Taking a 3-0 lead in a best-of-seven series
speaks for itself. But the Red Wings knew from experience that
going up 2-0 can mean nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, they were the two-time defending Stanley Cup
champions when they took a 2-0 lead over Colorado in the first
round. The Avalanche won the next four games and sent the Wings
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody pretty much had Colorado gone last year,''
Detroit winger Kirk Maltby said. ``I think maybe we got a little
caught up in reading the papers. They came back and kicked our
butts.''
</P>
<P>
   The beautiful people: Kings playoff games always have brought
out the stars and Monday night was no exception.
</P>
<P>
   Actresses Michelle Pfeiffer and Drew Barrymore headed the A
list. Also on hand: actors Cuba Gooding Jr. (season-ticket holder),
Kristy Swanson (original Buffy), Tiffany-Amber Thiesson, singer
Mark McGrath from the band Sugar Ray and tennis star Lindsay
Davenport.

IT MUST BE SPRING: SONICS AT IT AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Among the biggest concerns in the local sports media
when George Karl took all his neuroses to Milwaukee was we would no
longer be able to use for the Sonics those wonderfully hackneyed
adjectives that TV Guide uses to describe sit-coms.
</P>
<P>
   You know: Wacky. Zany. Screwball.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out the concern was unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   Even without Karl, the Sonics' springtime is again rich in
shaving-cream pies and seltzer bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Sacramento Tuesday night for their biggest game of
the year, and on the eve of a return to the playoffs, the Sonics
for the past three games swapped out 60 percent of their
season-long starting lineup to insert two rookies and a second-year
player not yet 21 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the club's star power forward, a U.S. Olympian in
whom the Sonics invested $87 million last summer, admitted over the
weekend to being out of shape, depressed and on a crying jag. But
at least, he said, he doesn't have an alcohol problem.
</P>
<P>
   These developments came on the heels of a fight between the
franchise superstar and a teammate that involved the hurling of
locker-room objects and resulted in a one-game injury absence for a
third teammate.
</P>
<P>
   If you're keeping score at home, this grades out as a full Jerry
Springer.
</P>
<P>
   Remember when it was considered a big deal in the final week of
the regular season to hear that Karl was quitting on his starting
center?
</P>
<P>
   That was back when the Sonics were winning 55-plus games and
people cared. Now, of course, with one of the great attendance
falloffs in the NBA, the annual April intrigue apparently has been
replaced by ennui.
</P>
<P>
   The average fan is not inspired by the subtle distinctions of
the stakes tonight: Getting run over in the playoffs by an
18-wheeler or by a freight train.
</P>
<P>
   This boredom may also be a result of the fact that the current
vaudeville is nothing particularly new. As was mentioned, panicky
lineup changes prior to the playoffs are hardly original to coach
Paul Westphal.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are locker-room blowups. Who can forget that splendid moment
a few years ago when Ricky Pierce threatened to fetch his gun at
halftime of a playoff game to settle a dispute with Gary Payton.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does one need a photographic memory to recall previous
Sonics power forwards troubled by unplanned paternity and reports
of drinking problems.
</P>
<P>
   Even the purely basketball troubles being experienced by Vin
Baker are hardly a matter of astonishment. In fact, here's a little
test for you professors of Sonics history:
</P>
<P>
   Q: Identify the date and speaker for the following quote: ``I'm
just playing like crap. I'm not doing anything to help my team.
It's a travesty not to play well.''
</P>
<P>
   A: Ah, you knew where this was going, didn't you?
</P>
<P>
   Baker uttered that self-assessment in May 1998, the first _ and
last _ time he was in the playoffs in his seven-year career. The
Sonics were in mid-swoon to the Los Angeles Lakers, who blasted the
Sonics from the postseason, 4-1, despite the fact that the Sonics
won 61 regular-season games. The four losses to L.A. were by an
average of 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, then the Sonics' only real inside player, was a primary
culprit, slinking through the series' first four games before a
28-point, 12-rebound effort in a mostly pointless Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   It was plain that he was intimidated by Shaquille O'Neal. That
is hardly unique to Baker. Some of the smaller continents have been
scared by Shaq.
</P>
<P>
   It also fails to explain what happened to Baker in the first
round against Minnesota, a mostly broken team that was down to
starting 6-foot-4 guard Terry Porter at center the final contest,
but still managed to extend the Sonics to the full five games
before losing the series.
</P>
<P>
   Baker averaged 14.8 points against the Timberwolves, five below
his team-leading average. After a mostly stellar first season in
Seattle following the trade of Shawn Kemp, Baker's series against
Minnesota was the first glimpse of his soft side that is now
painfully familiar.
</P>
<P>
   So the fact that Baker is now offering up a self-diagnosed case
of depression as a source of his travail rings a little hollow.
</P>
<P>
   Tests following the season may establish that he is indeed
clinically depressed. If true, it is a disorder that must be taken
seriously by him and the team. He deserves whatever support, time
and therapy is needed to return to good mental health.
</P>
<P>
   But if it is discovered instead that Baker is simply too nice
and/or too lazy to play pro basketball well, then he and the Sonics
have made a massive misjudgment. There is no treatment or pill for
a lack of fortitude.
</P>
<P>
   For now, it is almost impossible for outsiders to know what
troubles Baker. Even he may not know. But the mystery has been
going on for longer than the past couple of months, and the Sonics
have games Tuesday and Wednesday to figure it out, plus a couple of
practices.
</P>
<P>
   Take the freight train or the 18-wheeler, and give the points.

   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
RAWLINGS, the official juice supplier for major-league sluggers,
contends nothing has changed in 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   The longtime manufacturer of baseballs says the dimensions and
ingredients are the same today as they always have been: stitched
rawhide around a wound core, with the balls never weighing less
than five ounces nor having less than nine inches of circumference.
</P>
<P>
   Sure. And players still wear wool uniforms, pitchers still own
the inside of the plate, the strike zone hasn't changed, and all
those little vitamin cocktails players drink before and after
workouts are the same as the ones Babe Ruth used to guzzle.
</P>
<P>
   While there's no reason to believe Major League Baseball has
issued some sort of mandate directing Rawlings to make baseball
cores out of titanium while lacing the covers with plutonium, the
balls have changed.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients? Yes, the ingredients for baseballs are the same as
always. So are the ingredients for homemade bread.
</P>
<P>
   But does the stuff that comes out of the breadmaker on your
kitchen countertop taste as good as the rolls Mom used to make from
scratch? Of course not. Technology changes everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because the specifications are the same, that doesn't
mean they're the same kind of ball,'' Astros president Tal Smith
said. ``Without being a physicist, it would just seem to me that if
they are wound tighter, the ball goes further. I do think there
could be some validity that the balls, just through the
manufacturing process, could be wound tighter.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the first two weeks of the 2000 season, pitchers
throughout the game have complained about slick covers on baseballs
and the tightness of their feel.
</P>
<P>
   Fans, meanwhile, have rejoiced. Attendance numbers are solid,
and no matter what purists might say, it's home runs that make
channel-clickers tune in the evening news.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who has been involved in the game for more than 40 years,
won't argue the feel of the ball either way, but he admits that,
more than ever, the slide seems to be leaving sliders and the curve
likewise with curveballs.
</P>
<P>
   ``(In the past), you could almost pinch the skin on some of the
baseballs,'' Smith said. ``You could feel looseness on the cover.
You could almost move the skin of the ball with your hand.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk of smaller strike zones, diminished pitching
depth, better athletes taking better care of themselves and _
perhaps most significant _ more hitting-friendly ballparks, batters
still need to put the bat on the ball. But whenever that has
happened this season, the ball has been flying out of stadiums,
whether it's been Colorado's Coors Field, Enron Field or the
traditionally tough SkyDome in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Home run numbers have been going through the roof, almost
literally. On April 7, there were more homers hit (57) than on any
other day in baseball history. Dodgers shortstop Kevin Elster, who
only once in 12 previous seasons had more than 10 home runs in a
year, hit three in one game. Last Thursday, the St. Louis Cardinals
departed Houston and Enron Field, where they enjoyed a homerfest,
and promptly hit three home runs in the first inning of their game
at Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the Rockies took a 14-13 game against St. Louis that
featured 32 hits, Seattle's Alex Rodriguez parked three homers in a
19-7 win at Toronto, and Boston's Carl Everett slammed a
game-winning home run into a ninth-inning wind estimated at 20 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more than just the ballparks,'' Smith said. ``Ballparks
have something to do with it, but obviously that doesn't impact
what happens in Philly and Toronto.''
</P>
<P>
   After the first homestand in its history, Enron Field was viewed
as some sort of hitter's paradise, and compared to the Astrodome it
is. But home run and batting numbers at Enron are only in the
middle of the pack in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   This question about the ball always seems to come up whenever
home runs start flying out of yards at such dizzying rates. Is the
ball juiced?
</P>
<P>
   Of course it is _ this year more than ever. Baseball is in line
to shatter home run records in 2000, and no matter how many other
factors are involved, it's what has been happening when the wood
hits the horsehide that is the best evidence of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just the number of home runs but the distances
they've been traveling,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Purists might not like it, and MLB and Rawlings might be
reluctant to admit it because baseball clings to its tradition and
history. ``That's baseball,'' they say.
</P>
<P>
   But no doubt about it, the balls are juiced. That's technology.

Selig
<TEXT>
<P>
   Major League Baseball owners met at the Four Seasons Hotel on
Monday to discuss a realignment plan for next year, just two years
after the last realignment. The next reorganization of divisions,
expected to be approved in June, probably will be a short-term move
once again.
</P>
<P>
   After the meetings concluded, commissioner Bud Selig said, ``I
do think there will be some realignment next year. We'll go to an
unbalanced schedule, and we'll rotate divisions for interleague
play, absolutely. Everything I wanted to do, we will do.''
</P>
<P>
   His plan calls for the Texas Rangers to move from the American
League West to the AL Central. Arizona would switch from the
National League West to the AL West, and Tampa Bay would go from
the AL East to a new NL division to be called the Southeast. It
would include Atlanta, Florida and Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh would leave the NL Central for the NL East, where it
would be grouped with state rival Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   That would give the National League four divisions of four teams
each _ and no wild card.
</P>
<P>
   Selig said the main ``problem'' with this plan is the creation
of a six-team AL Central.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll work on that and vote on it at our league meetings in
June, at a site and date yet to be determined,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City Royals president Mike Hermann, whose club is in the
AL Central, said, ``When our young team becomes a contender, I want
to be on a level playing field. I don't want to be in a six-team
division when the other teams are in four-team divisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Use your common sense. But that doesn't always work for
baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Hermann also opposes abolishing the wild card in the National
League.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make sense to have it in one league and not in the
other,'' he said. ``Is that fair? I think the fans want regional
competition and a wild card.''
</P>
<P>
   Selig is committed to grouping teams regionally, and he appears
to place more importance on that concept than on maintaining
traditional league affiliations.
</P>
<P>
   Some owners, including the newest one, David Glass, whose
purchase of the Royals was unanimously approved Monday, favor the
sort of extensive realignment that would render the National and
American leagues virtually indistinguishable or perhaps even
nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Selig hedged on how much realignment he eventually wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leagues do have this wonderful history and tradition,'' he
said. ``Do I believe this is the last phase of realignment? I do
not. I believe there will be more.''
</P>
<P>
   By dismissing the league presidents, Leonard Coleman of the NL
and Gene Budig of the AL, Selig showed last year he was not bound
by tradition.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1998 realignment, he became the first owner to switch
leagues when he moved his Milwaukee Brewers from the American to
the National.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see them throw away all the leagues and just
organize it by regions,'' Hermann said. ``Now that you don't have
league offices, I don't think league identity is important.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our traditional leagues are just an historical thing. With
realignment and expansion, that's all changing. By keeping us in
these artificial leagues, you make us play games that don't draw
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Selig hopes to create better draws by setting up more
interleague play between rivals. He said the Astros and Rangers
``are clubs that should play each other _ as soon as next season.''
</P>
<P>
   Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr., a member of baseball's
realignment committee, was happy to hear that. ``We want to get the
Texas Rangers to the American League Central, so we can play them
regularly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McLane doesn't see a one-league concept developing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll always have the National and American leagues,'' he
said. ``I don't see any change in that. I think you'll have the
leagues and the importance of the leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hermann doubts fans are as concerned with tradition as they
once were.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's as much sensitivity to it as there was
in the 1950s and '60s,'' he said. ``I think the players moving the
way they have in the last several years, where you don't have the
long-term rivalries, with players you identify with, you get
confused over which teams you're playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Glass, whom Selig called ``the father of radical realignment,''
would like to see the major leagues divided into East and West,
rather than National and American.
</P>
<P>
   Hermann said that in time, fans as well as players would
appreciate the advantages of teams playing in their own time zones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually you get used to whatever division you're in,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, for fans to get used to their divisions, Major League
Baseball will have to keep from changing them every three or four
years. But Selig made it clear that realignment will continue to be
an ongoing, one-step-at-a-time process.

men get and maintain erections. And at least a dozen additional

   SCI-ABSINTHE (Undated) _ The rich may be different, as the
saying goes, but the richly creative are different still. And while
the impact of wealth is fairly easy to comprehend, just what goes
on inside the head of an artist, say, or poet is a mystery. Now,
however, researchers from the University of California at Berkeley
have learned a little about what went on inside the heads of some
of the more creative artists and poets the world has known. The
researchers have identified the mechanism by which absinthe, the
liqueur of choice for the likes of van Gogh, Rimbaud, Baudelaire,
Toulouse-Lautrec and others _ indeed, for much of 19th century
French society _ affects the brain. It makes neurons fire like mad.

   SCI-CONCERT-ACOUSTICS (Undated) _ Concert hall acoustics has had
only spotty success over the decades. But now an unusually intense
collaboration between architects and acousticians has put the
science of acoustics to the test, with two major new successes in
Tokyo. The halls in question are the 1,632-seat concert hall of the
multipurpose complex called Tokyo Opera City, and the 1,810-seat
opera house of the adjacent New National Theatre. Both have
acoustically daring designs, yet both have been praised by

   SCI-DIVING-MAMMALS (Undated) _ New research is unraveling the
old mystery of how air-breathing animals manage to dive so far
beneath the waves and stay down so long. Seals, dolphins, whales
and other marine mammals can plunge up to a mile or more into the
abyss and stay there as long as two hours on a single breath, a
feat that has baffled scientists for centuries. But the secret of
their deep diving may not lie, as had been thought, in their
physiological adaptions. Instead, the new findings suggest, it has
everything to do with the way they dive, gliding as much as
possible and freezing their movements to conserve energy and
oxygen. By William J. Broad.

   SCI-ASPIRIN (Undated) _ At first glance, the story of aspirin is
a scientific rags-to-riches fable straight from the pages of
Horatio Alger: Humble but deserving little pill makes good,
transformed after years of plodding fever and headache duty into a
powerful, life-saving heart drug. Three decades into its glamorous
second career, though, it turns out that aspirin is not such a
straightforward super hero of a pill after all. It has proved to be
an immensely complicated medication, with unsuspected dimensions to
both its powers and its limitations. By Abigail Zuger.

IRS SITTING ON MILLIONS IN UNCLAIMED REFUNDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ALEXA HAUSSLER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ So day trading's left you short, tax day drained
your savings and Regis Philbin won't give you the time of day.
Don't sweat it, just phone a friend: Uncle Sam.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, the Internal Revenue Service has millions of
dollars in unclaimed and undeliverable tax refunds for Americans,
including a $178,000 check waiting for one unnamed Los Angeles
County resident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We discovered that the IRS had all these checks that they just
had sitting there, credited to the taxpayer but undelivered,'' Rep.
Brad Sherman, D-Woodland Hills, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As last-minute filers were scrambling to mail their 1999 income
tax returns before the midnight deadline, Sherman announced that
his congressional Web site now displays the names of more than
4,500 taxpayers in Los Angeles and Ventura counties who have
unclaimed refunds from the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   The list shows names and communities but does not include dollar
amounts, to maintain individuals' privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The average unclaimed check is for more than $800, Sherman said.
The largest unclaimed refund check in the San Fernando Valley is
for $81,621.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here in the Valley, there's 81 grand waiting for somebody,''
Sherman said.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials say the unclaimed refunds, some of them
dating back to 1980, were undeliverable for various reasons. Some
taxpayers moved without giving the Post Office a change-of-address
notice. Others changed their names, such as in marriage, without
notifying the Social Security Administration that a new name goes
with the old Social Security number.
</P>
<P>
   ``People move with no forwarding address,'' said IRS spokeswoman
Maria Maqueda.
</P>
<P>
   She said the tax agency tries each year to get the word out that
thousands haven't received refunds, and some haven't even filed for
them.
</P>
<P>
   But Sherman said he thinks the tax agency could try harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to come as a surprise that the IRS doesn't work
as hard to find people when they owe you money than when you owe
them money,'' Sherman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News located one taxpayer listed on the Web site by
looking up his number in the telephone book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea! What a surprise,'' Kurt H. Bradley of Sherman
Oaks said when a reporter told him he was on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Internet list does not include dollar amounts, Bradley
was going to use an IRS toll-free number to find out how much he
will receive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to get on the horn immediately,'' Bradley said. But
when he did, an IRS hotline operator said his name does not appear
on the agency's list, even though his name is on the Web site list.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, some 100,000 people failed to claim more than $72
million in IRS refund checks in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles and Ventura counties, 4,548 residents have failed
to claim $3.8 million in undeliverable checks since 1980. The
average unclaimed refund check is for $837.
</P>
<P>
   About 870 current or former Valley residents have failed to
claim tax refunds.
</P>
<P>
   A taxpayers' advocate in Los Angeles County said the government
needs to try harder to find the taxpayers it owes money.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's $72 million, they ought to get some of the
bureaucrats to try to start searching them out,'' said Ernest
Dynda, president of the United Organization of Taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman said interns in his office this summer will search for
taxpayers who are owed refunds.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, those who suspect they are on the list can
check via www.dailynews.com or Sherman's Web site at
www.house.gov/sherman, or call the IRS hotline at (800) 829-1040.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, 48, a Paramount Pictures teamster, said he has moved
three times in three years and was shocked to learn he had money
coming to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually when somebody owes you money, unless you ask for it,
unless you confront them, they just let it go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He doubts his is the $81,000 check, and doesn't know how much
his newfound fortune may be. But he knows what he'll do with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to put it in the bank,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to listing the names of residents who are owed
money, Sherman said he will push the IRS to post a searchable
national list on its Web site and work harder to locate people.

LAPD OFFICERS WATCH D.C. PROTESTS TO PLAN FOR CONVENTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV, LISA VAN PROYEN AND BILL HILLBURG 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As protesters tied up Washington, D.C., on Monday,
Los Angeles police were there watching and learning _ to avert
similar disruptions at the Democratic National Convention in
August.
</P>
<P>
   About six officers from several Los Angeles police divisions
observed Washington metro police tactics and security plans. The
Democratic National Convention takes place in Los Angeles between
Aug. 14 and Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not anticipate any problems here, but we will absolutely
be prepared for anything that may occur,'' said Los Angeles police
Cmdr. Dave Kalish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already started training for officers on all the issues
that will be involved, from crowd control to protecting people's
First Amendment rights,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A protest area will be set up near Staples Center in downtown
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators converging on Washington represented at least
100 groups with various agendas, all allied to protest the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank's loans to Third World
countries. A spokeswoman for an organizing group said she knows of
no plans to demonstrate in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are only concerned with issues involving the IMF and the
World Bank,'' said Becka Economopoulos, spokeswoman for
Mobilization for Global Justice. ``But there are more than 100
groups represented here with a number of concerns. I believe that a
lot of these players will be in Los Angeles when the Democrats meet
and will be in Philadelphia for the Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles police said they are taking no chances after
watching World Trade Organization demonstrators overrun Seattle,
causing severe damage and disrupting downtown for days.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, Seattle was caught off guard, and we want to be
sure we learn from that experience,'' Kalish said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not inexpensive, but it's an investment that's well worth
it,'' Kalish said. ``We knew this would be an outstanding
opportunity to watch and learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles police are monitoring Internet sites of groups
involved in the Washington protests to try to learn their plans for
the convention, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Some security experts have voiced privately their concern that
convention planners are not taking seriously the security concerns
on a variety of issues, such as access to areas designated as
private within Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Officials, however, said they are following the advice of the
LAPD, FBI and Secret Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel very confident with the work being done by the LAPD
and the federal law enforcement agencies,'' said Ben Austin,
spokesman for the LA2000 Committee.

DIZZY DAY FOR DRISSI
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEN VILLA  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ The officials took away Tomy Drissi's title
on Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But what they couldn't take away was the feeling of taking home
the checkered flag.
</P>
<P>
   One day after finishing first only to learn later the outcome
had changed after the Trans-Am Race of the Toyota of Long Beach
Grand Prix, Drissi was in relatively upbeat spirits.
</P>
<P>
   Drissi, who was last season's Rookie of the Year on the Trans-Am
Circuit, thought he had won Sunday's Trans-Am race for his first
career win.
</P>
<P>
   But two hours later, race officials ruled that lap 35, the
race's final one, should have never been allowed because the
60-minute time limit had expired.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of winning the race, Drissi wound up third, behind
Johnny Miller and Chris Neville.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just technical stuff,'' Drissi said. ``No one can take
that win away from me ever. No one can take the thousands of people
cheering for me when I crossed the finish line first and no one can
take the feeling I had when I drove up to the winner's circle and
hoisted the first-place trophy over my head.
</P>
<P>
   ``The race officials had two options, to go by the rule book or
to let the race end the way it originally did, with me being the
winner. It's not my fault they dropped the green flag when they
shouldn't have, but I'm not a judge or anything like that. I'm just
a race car driver whose job is to finish in first place when the
checkered flag is dropped and I did that.''
</P>
<P>
   All the controversy started on lap 34. The race, which was under
the yellow caution flag at the time, was heading into its final
lap.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was the leader, Neville was in second and Drissi in
third. By all accounts, the race should have ended in the 34th lap
because the 60-minute mark had expired.
</P>
<P>
   But race officials who were unaware of the situation dropped the
green flag, allowing the drivers to continue.
</P>
<P>
   With every driver in a full sprint to the finish line, Neville
ended up hitting Miller, sending both cars into the wall. The
accident cleared the way for Drissi to take home first place.
</P>
<P>
   He was allowed to drive to the winner's circle, take part in the
trophy presentation and was even escorted to the media room to be
interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, rules officials declared Miller the winner
because he was in front under the caution flag when time expired
and notified Drissi that he had been relegated to third place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously the decision benefited me,'' Miller said. ``I do
feel bad for Tomy though, he ran a great race, but the fact is,
they should have stopped it when 60 minutes was over. I knew the
race was over in my car when we were under the yellow caution flag
because the 60-minute timer in my car had expired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my crew chief that the race was over but he said they
were going to drop the green flag anyway and for me to get ready. I
thought they were crazy. I was glad the race officials made the
right decision and changed the ruling, but I hated to win like
that.''

VITESSE CHIPS IN AS TECH STOCKS RALLY

<P>
   CAMARILLO, Calif. _ Shares of Vitesse Semiconductor Inc. jumped
34 percent on Monday, one of the strong tech sector performances
that helped boost the Nasdaq to its largest single-day point gain.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of its first-quarter earnings report, investors
drove Vitesse's stock up $18.38 a share to close at $73.06 in
regular-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   The stock lost some of that gain after hours, at one point
falling $5.06 to $68.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Vitesse's daytime rally helped the Nasdaq as a
whole rebound Monday as it gained 217.87 points, or 6.56 percent,
its second-largest percentage gain to date. This followed Friday's
drop of 355.49 points, a record.
</P>
<P>
   Vitesse, which makes semiconductors for telecommunications
equipment, reported a 50 percent increase in its revenues over the
same quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
   Before accounting for its $450 million acquisition of chip maker
Orologic Inc., Vitesse had quarterly earnings of $27 million, or 16
cents per share, beating by a penny the consensus estimate of
analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial's First Call service.
</P>
<P>
   The company reported a net loss of $18.6 million, or 12 cents
per share, after the acquisition charge of $45.6 million. For the
same period a year ago, Vitesse reported earnings of $15.5 million,
or 9 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of Orologic, combined with Vitesse's year-ago
purchase of Xaqti, gives the company a one-two punch in data
communications chips, said Lou Tomasetta, Vitesse's president and
chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combination of these two chips will give the customer a
very sophisticated network processor-traffic manager solution. The
combination of these is going to drive a very significant revenue
stream for us,'' Tomasetta said. ``Our intention is to become one
of the major players in this network processor field.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Bunting, analyst for Thomas Weisel Partners, said
Vitesse's revenues were $2 million higher than analysts were
anticipating.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's stock performance Monday was less in
anticipation of the earnings report than it was a recovery from the
market's recent battering, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens at times like this is when the market reacts, the
strongest names in the strongest spaces tend to recover first,''
Bunting said. ``It's hard to predict what the market will do in
such volatile conditions as these.''
</P>
<P>
   Vitesse's recovery Monday paralleled that of competitors
Broadcomm and PMC, both of which also make integrated circuits for
telecommunications equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Bunting said the entire sector stands to benefit as the makers
of telecommunications equipment respond to high demand for their
products by increasing the amount of chip manufacturing they
outsource to other chip makers.

MURRAY MAKES RIGHT CHOICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This is why Andy Murray gets our vote for NHL
Coach of the Year over St. Louis's Joel Quenneville. Because he
kept his head when a lot of people were calling for Stephane
Fiset's.
</P>
<P>
   Murray reinserted Fiset in the net Monday, two days after Fiset
had a shaky outing against Detroit, for the same reason he wouldn't
divorce his wife Ruth if she maxed out a credit card or disown any
of his three children if they brought home failing grades.
</P>
<P>
   Murray does not act impulsively. He has principles and he
adheres to them even when it's neither convenient nor conventional.
In some circles, that's called character. In Southern California,
though, where tans tend to last longer than convictions or
commitments, Murray's decision to stand by his No. 1 goaltender was
considered curious.
</P>
<P>
   The day before the Kings' 2-1 loss - we'll get to that in a
second - we found ourselves in an animated discussion with an L.A.
native who absolutely, positively believed Fiset should have had to
sit for letting in Kris Draper's unscreened shot in the fourth
minute of the second period of the Kings's 8-5 loss Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Fiset had played so well in the Kings's Game1
loss, he earned the No.2 star. Nothing we said could convince Mr.
You've-Got-To-Go-With-Jamie-Storr otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt there will be more second-guessers where he came from.
They're sure to sprout like mushrooms after a rain now that the
Kings stand one loss from being swept out of the playoffs, same as
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   So we'll be outnumbered, just like the Kings were when Detroit
scored each of its first two goals.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   Show us somebody who tries to pin this latest loss on Fiset and
we'll show you somebody who watched the game blindfolded.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset didn't give up an even-strength score. The Red Wings got a
power-play goal in the sixth minute of the first period and another
in the 15th minute of the second. Meantime, the best the Kings
could do when skating with an extra man was a solitary shot-on-goal
during a four-minute power play early in the second.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you keeping track at home, they are 0 for 16 with a
man advantage in the series.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset stopped 22 shots - including two rapid-fire shots by
Detroit captain Steve Yzerman on a breakaway late in the third.
With any help from his friends on special teams, that would have
been enough.
</P>
<P>
   It says here Murray's method of dealing with his players was
validated Monday, even if victory eluded the Kings. Unlike his
predecessor Larry Robinson, who benched Fiset in the 1998 playoffs
under circumstances similar to this year's, Murray vowed to stick
with the glove hand that had brought the Kings this far.
</P>
<P>
   For this, Murray doesn't think he ought to be lauded or even
applauded. In his eyes, he wasn't being controversial, merely
consistent.
</P>
<P>
   ``All season I've always gone back to a player and given him
another chance,'' Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   Monday would be no different, even if it was the most monumental
game of Murray's first year with the Kings. ``I just thought it was
what you should do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This is why we heralded Murray's hire last June and are even
higher on him 10 months later. The consistency of his coaching
means his players never have to wonder where they stand.
</P>
<P>
   If a couple of players (a veteran centerman? a left wing?) stand
between the Kings and greater glory in the playoffs, well, that's
something to take up with general manager Dave Taylor, not Murray.
</P>
<P>
   For however much longer the season lasts, you can bet Murray
will continue to pull players aside daily for speeches that are
never canned. You see, to Murray his players are just like
snowflakes each uniquely different. He'd sooner run an unscripted
practice than treat his players like interchangeable parts.
</P>
<P>
   He recognizes that Fiset's personality is different than Storr's
and handles each netminder accordingly. Fiset is more sensitive and
wears his passion like extra padding.
</P>
<P>
   ``That comes from being French-Canadian,'' Murray said,
referring to the goaltender's Montreal roots.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing Fiset as well as he does, Murray made a point of pulling
Fiset early in Game 2, benching him just long enough to tell him
``I have confidence in you.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he had to chase after Fiset first. His memories of
1998 opened like an old scab, the goaltender headed straight down
the hall to the dressing room, assuming his day was done.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes into the second period, it would be. But even as
he supplanted Fiset with Storr, Murray whispered reassuring words
into Fiset's ear. He knew then, even if the dejected goalie didn't,
that he would go back to Fiset on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing in coaching,'' Murray said, ``is you can't ever do
something or say something you can't follow through on.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, that's the thing in playing, too, and Monday the
Kings' special teams simply didn't follow through.

KINGS RUNNING OUT OF CHANCES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It looked like the fans wore black for a reason,
but the Kings were just itching to take a peek under the shroud of
the Detroit Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   After playing most of Monday like they had nothing to win, the
Kings finally came out in the third period with nothing to lose.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, they still lost 2-1 to the Red Wings and now face
the hockey no-man's-land of trying to come back from an 0-3
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   But they gave themselves and the 18,118 at Staples Center a few
moments to remember in the third period, beginning with a goal by
Luc Robitaille and a jump in their step that brought cheers from
the darkness.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille's goal, the 49th of his playoff career, came just
three minutes into the period after the Kings had fallen behind. He
did not have a shot in the game's first 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a disastrous power play that is 0 for 16 in this
best-seven series, the Kings started to apply pressure. Several
minutes later, seldom-used Brad Chartrand had playoff hero written
on his jersey when he took a pass from Ian Laperriere in front of
the Red Wings' net with a chance to tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   But goaltender Chris Osgood, who shut out the Kings in Game 1
and held on for dear life to win Game 2, made the stop.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the Red Wings are one game from heading to the second
round and one game from their third consecutive series sweep in a
playoff series opener.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings now face the daunting task of coming back from 0-3,
accomplished only twice in NHL history.
</P>
<P>
   The first happened in 1942 when the Toronto Maple Leafs won four
straight to defeat the Red Wings for the Stanley Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, the New York Islanders defeated the Pittsburgh Penguins
in the Eastern Conference finals after falling behind 0-3.
</P>
<P>
   Osgood's save destroyed the Kings' momentum and they never
seemed to recover.
</P>
<P>
   After each game in the series they came away saying they had
shown the Red Wings their best.
</P>
<P>
   In a 2-0 loss in Game 1, the Kings held their own against the
Red Wings' superior talent, but couldn't quite make it through the
neutral zone.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 2, they lost 8-5 but refused to back down from Detroit's
fire power.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there is a reason staying close has not been good enough
in this series. Most of the Detroit players are holdovers from
Stanley Cup champions two of the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   But at the end, goaltender Stephane Fiset showed why he has been
the Kings' most consistent player in the series, even though he
allowed nine goals in three games.
</P>
<P>
   With 4:55 remaining, Detroit's top player Steve Yzerman had a
chance to put the game away when he broke in on Fiset. Yzerman
waited until Fiset dropped to the ice before shooting, but Fiset
made a spectacular glove save agains the left goal post.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not enough for the Kings, who managed just 22 shots
on Osgood. They went 0 for 6 on the power play, including a
four-minute man advantage four minutes into the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit jumped on top just 5:21 into the game because of another
Kings problem: too many penalties. The Red Wings enjoyed a
five-on-three advantage after Rob Blake was whistles off for high
sticking.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit, which led the league with a 20.3 percent conversion
rate on the power play, toyed with the Kings in their zone. Sergei
Fedorovwon the faceoff after the Blake penalty, took a spot near
the Kings net and beat Fiset after a pass from Niklas Lidstrom.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings second goal, the eventual game winner by Tomas
Holmstrom also came on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   With 14:40 gone in the second and Jozef Stumpel off for cross
checking, Holmstrom redirected a Lidstrom shot past Fiset.

PINNACLE MERGER CREATES MAJOR PLAYER IN CASINO INDUSTRY

<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENDALE, Calif. _ Pinnacle Entertainment Inc., the
Glendale-based casino owner and operator, said Monday that it has
agreed to be purchased by a subsidiary of Harveys Casino Resorts
for up to $1.3 billion in cash and assumed debt.
</P>
<P>
   Under the planned merger, Lake Tahoe, Nev.-based Harveys' newly
formed subsidiary, PH Casino Resorts, would pay $24 per share for
all of Pinnacle's stock.
</P>
<P>
   PH would pay an additional $1 per share if Pinnacle sells its 97
acres of surplus land in Inglewood for at least $40.75 million
after taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Harveys would also assume about $625 million in Pinnacle debt
under the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The deal _ signed early Monday _ marks the end of an era for
Pinnacle. In recent years the former owner of Hollywood Park
racetrack in Los Angeles has transformed itself from a horse racing
firm to a major player in the gambling industry, with eight casinos
in Nevada, Mississippi, Louisiana and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   ``This merger consummates the transformation,'' said Bruce
Hinckley, Pinnacle's senior vice president and chief financial
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Hinckley said the deal would create the fifth-largest casino
company in the country and one of the biggest players in markets
outside of Las Vegas and Atlantic City, the traditional capitals of
U.S. gambling.
</P>
<P>
   The board of directors for Pinnacle and Harveys have already
approved the deal. Pinnacle senior management would retain a $50
million investment in the merged company, and Hinckley said
Pinnacle's management would likely continue operating the new
firm's casinos.
</P>
<P>
   But the merger still faces several hurdles, including the
approval of Pinnacle stockholders and gaming regulators in several
states.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Rafferty, senior vice president of marketing for Harveys,
said he expects the regulatory process to go smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of these are outstanding, well-run casino companies,'' he
said. ``We're assuming licensing will be positive.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal is also contingent on the timely completion of
Pinnacle's Belterra Resort and Casino in Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   The resort is key to the success of the merger, according to
analyst Mike Crawford of B. Riley &AMP; Co. in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most attractive thing about Pinnacle, besides cash coming
in from asset sales, is the crown jewel resort they're building in
Indiana,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford estimated that the new project could create cash flow
of $40 million in its first year.

POWER OUTAGE FOR KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's called a power play, but for the Kings, it's
more like powerless play.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen times in this Western Conference first-round series with
Detroit, the Kings have had a man advantage, including seven times
for 11 minutes, 29 seconds in Monday's third game. Each time, they
failed to score.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's anemic right now,'' defenseman Garry Galley said.
</P>
<P>
   No one in the Kings locker room disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   Not after taking just one shot during a four-minute power play
in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Not after spending more time chasing down the puck than setting
up shots.
</P>
<P>
   Not after taking no more than two shots on any chance over the
final two periods.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the time, we were going crossways instead of
north-to-south,'' Galley said. ``We struggled to get the puck in
good position. We know our assignments. We just have to execute.''
</P>
<P>
   Executing on the power play has been a problem for much of the
season. Sure, the Kings started the season scoring at least one
power-play goal in eight of their first 10 games, helping
themselves eventually reach not only the Pacific Division lead but
also the Western Conference's best record.
</P>
<P>
   But that was back in October and November. In March, the Kings
scored on just five of 59 attempts and finished the regular season
60 for 355 (16.9 percent). Amazingly, that ranked them 10th in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   That won't get it done in the playoffs. They can only wish they
can reach 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our power play didn't make the other team pay,'' Kings coach
Andy Murray said. ``They took as many bad penalties as we did, but
we couldn't take advantage. The best way to take advantage when a
team is playing physical is to score goals on the power play.''
</P>
<P>
   And they didn't, in part because the Red Wings took Rob Blake
out of the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit decided Blake was the key to the Kings attack, so it
shadowed, checked and poked him wherever he went. Blake got off
just three shots the entire game, none of which were quality
power-play shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made it tough for them getting the puck into their zone,''
Detroit goalie Chris Osgood said. ``We got on Blake and forced him
to make bad dumps.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just the Red Wings, however. The Kings' first
opportunity ended after just 57 seconds when Luc Robitaille was
called for charging in the attacking zone.
</P>
<P>
   But the worst came early in the second period, when Detroit's
Darren McCarty was called for tripping, complained and was hit with
an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, giving the Kings a man
advantage for four minutes while down 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   When that ended with one shot, by Ziggy Palffy on a breakaway
right into Osgood, the crowd booed, and it booed often because
numerous times the Kings would pass behind to no one, and the puck
would slide into the neutral zone.
</P>
<P>
   With 4:55 to play, Chris Chelios went off for holding with the
Red Wings holding a 2-1 lead. Two minutes later, the score remained
the same, and the Kings had taken just one shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some good chances on the power play,'' center Ian
Laperriere said. ``We have to keep working and try to put some
traffic in front of the net.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The fans were dressed in black, but it was the
Detroit Red Wings who wore the shroud.
</P>
<P>
   They sent the Kings to the no-man's land of playoff hockey
Monday night with a 2-1 victory at Staples Center, giving Detroit a
staggering 3-0 lead in this best-of-seven first-round series.
</P>
<P>
   Only two teams have come back from such a hole, now a black hole
that 18,118 fans couldn't help fill.
</P>
<P>
   And though there are plenty of numbers that help explain the
Kings' predicament, like 0 for 16 on the power play and 0 for their
last 11 playoff games, it's the words from coach Andy Murray after
Game 1 that still haunted his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played well enough to stay close but not well enough to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   They still gave up too many penalties to the league's best power
play. Both Red Wings goals _ by Sergei Fedorov just 5:21 into the
game and Tomas Holmstrom 14:40 into the second came with the man
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   But now the Kings have not won a playoff game since Game 1 of
the 1993 Stanley Cup Finals. And they aren't sure why.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that is the biggest question of this series,'' said
defenseman Mattias Norstrom. ``Why have we done well but come up
short? One thing I do know, we will be back Wednesday (Game 4) and
our heads will be held high.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem Monday was except for a few sparkling moments early
in the third period _ when Luc Robitaille scored and seldom-used
Brad Chartrand had a chance to tie _ the Kings rarely matched up
with the Wings.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille's goal, the 49th of his playoff career, came 2:35
into the third period. But for the first 40 minutes, he did not
have a shot on Detroit goaltender Chris Osgood, who shut out the
Kings in Game 1 and held on for dear life to win Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes later, when Chartrand had playoff hero written on
his jersey after taking a pass from Ian Laperriere, Osgood was
there again. It destroyed the Kings' momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every minute of this series the Kings have been playing
real well,'' Osgood said. ``We've been battling for everything
we've earned.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings now face the daunting task of coming back from 0-3,
accomplished only twice in NHL history.
</P>
<P>
   That first happened in 1942 when the Toronto Maple Leafs won
four straight to defeat the Red Wings in the Stanley Cup Finals.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, the New York Islanders defeated the Pittsburgh Penguins
in the Eastern Conference finals after falling behind 0-3.
</P>
<P>
   In a 2-0 loss in Game 1, the Kings held their own against the
Red Wings' superior talent but couldn't quite make it through the
neutral zone.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 2, the Kings lost 8-5 but refused to back down from
Detroit's fire power.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there is a reason staying close has not been good enough
in this series. Most of the Detroit players are holdovers from
teams that won the Stanley Cup two of the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   But at the end, goaltender Stephane Fiset showed why he has been
the Kings' most consistent player in the series, even though he
allowed nine goals in three games.
</P>
<P>
   With 4:55 remaining, the Detroit's top player, Steve Yzerman,
had a chance to put the game away when he broke in on Fiset.
Yzerman waited until Fiset dropped to the ice before shooting, but
Fiset made a spectacular glove save against the left goal post.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset was pulled by Murray after allowing five goals in Game 2.
Murray blamed his defense and vowed to stick with Fiset.
</P>
<P>
   Win or lose, the Kings got his best Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really important for me tonight to prove to Andy that
he did the right thing.''

<P>
   With Passover beginning Wednesday, there's no better time to
check in with Kosherfinder, a site that celebrates all things
Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   The opening page includes links to a special Passover report,
and also features sections on health and nutrition, wine, kosher
dishes, books, colleges and dispatches from Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the ``on campus'' features notes that this summer,
20 Dartmouth students will be participating in ``Israel 2000,'' a
program that allows Jewish college students who have never been to
Israel to visit the Jewish Holy Land for free.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the news section led off with a British court ruling
against historian David Irving, who challenged the scope of the
Holocaust. Irving had sued an American scholar for libel, claiming
she had labeled him a ``Holocaust denier.'' In ruling against
Irving, a British judge labeled him ``anti-Semitic and racist.''
</P>
<P>
   The Passover section is especially interesting, even for the
uninitiated. It explains the origin of the Jewish holiday, the
significance of the Seder plate and how to prepare for Passover,
among other things.
</P>
<P>
   The recipe section (known alternately as ``Kosher Classics'' and
``Bubbie's Kitchen''), offers Passover specialties, such as
cauliflower kugel with mushrooms.

   In the problems-we-wish-we-had department, there's a big piece
on ``sudden-wealth syndrome'' {ndash} essentially people who strike
it rich investing in Internet stocks or somesuch and immediately
plunge into depression. Apparently, psychiatrists solve the problem
by charging outrageous fees and siphoning off some of that
new-found wealth. Favorite line in the piece, ``Once you're done
sneering{hellip}'' Oh, I don't think we'll ever be done. There is
also a fairly useful story on tech investing, which tries to steer
you toward the stock that isn't about to crash into a bridge
abutment and burst into a ball of flame. Bottom line: You might
have better luck picking winners at Phoenix Greyhound Park. There
is also an interesting short written by someone who made a cell
phone their only phone, and soon learned what ``searching for
service'' really means.

   It's only like a page long, but Chris Harris' takeoff on the
Census (an ersatz letter written by Census director Kenneth
Prewitt) is one long belly laugh. A few samples: ``We have been
accused of undercounting certain segments of the population. This
is simply not true, and we think all three of our nation's Native
Americans will back us up on this.'' Or, ``Moreover, although there
are no problems with the Census, we are constantly making
improvements to correct those problems.'' There is an interesting
piece on the Russian mob in America, noting FBI warnings that the
so-called ``Mafiya'' could soon become the No.1 criminal
organization in the U.S. Finally, an explanation for the popularity
of Yakov Smirnoff. A well-done piece on obsessive-compulsive
disorder questions whether it's such a great idea to drown the
``doubting disease'' in an ocean of Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   TRUE WEST
</P>
<P>
   This fun little mag , published in Cave Creek, devotes itself to
debunking some of the myths of the Old West perpetuated by
Hollywood. For example, John Wayne didn't really die in
(beginitalic)The Cowboys(enditalic). So you can stop being so mad
at Bruce Dern. Seriously, this month's issue notes that not all
cowboys carried Colt Peacemakers. Some, including notorious outlaws
Frank and Jesse James, were more partial to Remington revolvers.
Also, Wild Bill Hickok and Calamity Jane were not lovers, despite
what the supermarket tabloids said. There is also an interesting
piece on Western ``stock actors,'' who traveled from town to town
performing in different plays, making the grandiose sum of $8 per
week. The most famous stock performer may be John Wilkes Booth,
Lincoln's assassin.
</P>
<P>
   VANITY FAIR
</P>
<P>
   There is the usual Hollywood feature, this time on flaky cover
girl Kim Basinger, the Janie one-note actress who is always being
compared to someone who was a lot better. In this case, it's
Marilyn Monroe. Puh-lease. We get to hear about her angst over
being famous, beautiful and married to hunk movie star Alec
Baldwin. It's a heavy load to bear. Searching for more fluff? The
magazine doesn't disappoint, posing Sarah Ferguson in a blazer and
fishnet stockings for a Q&AMP;A. On the serious side, there is a book
excerpt on the real-life maritime disaster that inspired Melville
to write (beginitalic)Moby-Dick(enditalic): the 1820 sinking of the
Nantucket whaler, (beginitalic)Essex, (enditalic)by a rogue sperm
whale. Historian Nathaniel Philbrick draws on newly discovered
documents to weave the tale of the crew, who were driven to near
madness after being set adrift in the Pacific.

points out that Gabriel Garcia Marquez once was asked to write the
introduction to a book about Che Guevara, and he said, roughly,
``Sure, but I'll need 1,000 pages and 10 years to do it.'' That,
Goldman says, is the way he felt when he sat down to write about
his mother. But he managed (in only 12 pages), and so did the other
contributors to this anthology of poignant essays written by Latin
authors about their mothers. Dagoberto Gilb ((beginitalic)The Last
(enditalic)(beginitalic)Known Residence of Mickey Acuna(enditalic))
writes about his love as a young child for the beautiful woman who
gave birth to him, and the sadness of his estrangement from her as
he grew older. Editor Santiago (beginitalic)(When I Was Puerto
Rican)(enditalic) recalls the difficult life of her mother, a
determined, tenacious, sometimes violent woman who was, her
daughter says, ``an example of what we should avoid and what we
should aspire to.'' Other contributors include Junot Diaz and

   This is a terrific first novel that will appeal to readers who
loved Charles Frazier's 1997 book, (beginitalic)Cold Mountain.
(enditalic)You might even think they're the same story for a while,
because Lent's hero, like Frazier's, is a soldier making his way
home at the end of the Civil War. But Lent's Norman Pelham reaches
his family's farm in Vermont quickly and without trauma, and he
brings a woman with him. Her name is Leah, and she is a runaway
slave who helped Norman when she found him wounded in Virginia.
Lent's novel tells three stories: that of Norman and Leah, their
marriage and family and the making of their successful farm; that
of their troubled son, Jamie, a bootlegger during the years of
Prohibition; and that of Jamie's sweet-tempered boy, Foster, who
travels into the South to uncover the secret that eventually
destroyed his grandmother's life with Norman and their children.
There's violence, romance and poetic prose here, from a writer who
shows remarkable talent. Enjoy.

   During filming, studio censors suggested, laughably, that
``either Karen or Warden put on a beach robe or some other type of
clothing before they go into the embrace.'' Karen was Deborah Kerr,
Warden was Burt Lancaster, and the beach robe was notably absent
from their surf-jostled kiss in (beginitalic)From Here to
Eternity(enditalic). Lancaster, Buford says, ``blends into our
collective memory like a famous uncle who was once a great
athlete.'' Throughout his life, he was a study in contradiction.
Known for his rages, promiscuity and mood swings, he also was
capable of great kindness and loyalty. In his youth, he was one of
Hollywood's most macho stars, yet the town simmered with rumors of
his bisexuality. And his movies were both provocative
((beginitalic)Atlantic City(enditalic)) and vapid
((beginitalic)Airport(enditalic)). Most of all, he was known for
his physical presence - his strength, his beauty, his sexuality.
That's what readers bring to the table, and what makes this

   Rebecca Solnit
</P>
<P>
   (Viking, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   Your mind will wander as you read this, and who's to say that's
not what it's supposed to do? Solnit offers a history of walking,
in which meandering, both mental and physical, is part of the
exercise. As Jean-Jacques Rousseau said, ``I can only meditate when
I am walking. When I stop, I cease to think; my mind only works
with my legs.'' Or, as Solnit writes, ``Walking is a state in which
the mind, the body and the world are aligned, as though they were
three characters finally in conversation together, three notes
suddenly making a chord.'' She discusses how walking touches many
fields - anatomy, gardening, anthropology, architecture, geography,
history, literature, philosophy, sexuality, religious studies.
This, of course, gives her license to talk about everything and
everyone, from the street sense of Charles Dickens to the poetry of
Gary Snyder to the role of walking in courtship, protest and
emancipation. Best of all, this is a book that encourages you to
put it down, and go for a walk of your own.

BETTER NET CALLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Phoning over the Internet still conjures up images of stringing
tin cans to your computer to make free, fuzzy calls to Pakistan.
But the technology is rapidly going mainstream, with a lot of help
from local companies.
</P>
<P>
   Burlington-based iBasis has just announced it signed a deal to
carry voice and fax traffic through carefully directed Net packets
with Operadora Protel, a top Mexican national carrier. More than 4
billion minutes of calls were made between the United States and
Mexico last year.
</P>
<P>
   iBasis is in a dogfight with California-based ITXC for bragging
rights to being the biggest phone-to-phone Net carrier. Already,
though, iBasis is handling about one of every 10 calls between the
United States and China. And the worldwide market for Internet
telephony is expected to hit $19 billion by 2004, according to
market analysts IDC.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge market there that's not going to go away for a
long time,'' says Ofer Gneezy, the iBasis cofounder and president.
``This space is so huge that we don't feel like anybody is crowding
each other.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's announcement late last month that it was teaming with
partners to take a $1.4 billion stake in Net2Phone was also read as
a big stamp of approval for the technology. Net2Phone of
Hackensack, N.J., and New York-based Deltathree.com are leaders in
the computer-to-phone Net calling market, where you buy a headset
to make calls from your computer, often for free.
</P>
<P>
   Supporting the growth of Net telephony are a passel of local
system and equipment vendors, including Natural MicroSystems Corp.
of Framingham, Mass., which just reported a profitable first
quarter with revenues 67 percent ahead of last year.

   Built-in DSL modem

</P>
<P>
   A Mansfield, Mass. unit of Motorola has unveiled software
technology that can eliminate the need for a separate modem to get
high-speed digital subscriber line Internet access for your
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Called SoftDSL, the product is expected to start appearing in
computers next winter, said Pat Casey, general manager of
Motorola's software products division. Instead of having to buy a
$199 DSL modem, you might spend half as much to get a built-in DSL
modem in your computer. Motorola also announced a faster, smaller
version of its built-in dial-up computer modem that is now barely
the size of a postage stamp.

</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Conversent Communications of Marlborough, Mass., a start-up
telecom business that focuses on markets the big guys often ignore,
is signing a $3.6 million, 20-year deal with NorthEast Optic
Network in Westborough, Mass. for fiber capacity to cope with rapid
growth and expand its operations around New England.
</P>
<P>
   Two-year-old Conversent has found a promising niche in smaller
cities such as Worcester, Providence, Quincy, and Lowell. Nearly
all of its customers have less than 24 phone lines. Its CEO, Robert
Fanch, sold his last business to Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen
last November. And with several former Brooks Fiber executives at
the helm, the company is looking to expand nationally into second-
and third-tier markets this year.
</P>
<P>
   In the same vein, Choice One Communications of Rochester, N.Y.,
has also been quietly making big inroads into Central and Western
Massachusetts, installing equipment to provide digital subscriber
line access for small businesses _ along with voice lines _ from 42
central offices from Bellingham to Deerfield.

<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Huh?

   Are you in a fog about what all these new telecom products
actually do? Don't feel bad. Unisphere Solutions in Chelmsford
recently had Impulse Research of Los Angeles poll 200 CEOs and
chief information officers at Fortune 500 companies.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty percent said they can't understand what new technologies
they are being pitched are supposed to do, and almost as many said
technology vendors don't understand their needs. But fewer than 1
in 8 said they are confident their company has the communications
technology it needs for the near future.

AFTER THE FALL: SHAKY GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Buoyancy returned to Wall Street Monday, but a bear
market in technology stocks had already gone to work on the
Boston-area economy.
</P>
<P>
   With companies absorbing last week's market losses and halting
planned stock sales, economists and analysts said a
long-anticipated shakeout may finally be underway in the Internet
and software industries _ and may ripple into the larger economy.
</P>
<P>
   The local economy, with its huge stake in technology, expanded
in recent years with each 1000-point breakthrough by the Nasdaq
Composite index. So it follows that, as technology stocks fall back
to earth _ and analysts say they may fall further, despite Monday's
217.87-point rebound in the Nasdaq to 3539.16 _ the metropolitan
area inside Interstate 495 is more vulnerable than the nation
overall.
</P>
<P>
   That's the conventional wisdom. Some economists, however, say a
Nasdaq correction may actually restore balance to a tech-driven
economy that is increasingly out of whack. The Internet boom has
fueled huge appreciation in Boston-area real estate prices and
intensified a labor-market shortage that had already crimped job
creation in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear stories from non-(tech) employers who are happy this is
happening, because they figure they'll be able to fill some jobs
they haven't been able to,'' said Alan Clayton-Matthews, an
economics professor at the University of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   That logic may also apply to the US economy, which is beginning
to experience rising wages and prices.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market decline ``could be a very positive thing'' if
it causes ``enough cooling of the economy to prevent a boom-bust
scenario,'' said Rachael Chioino, an economist for Standard &AMP;
Poor's/DRI, a Lexington consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan has credited the
``wealth effect'' from rising stock prices with powering the
economic boom of the late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow is now 10 percent below its January high. If a market
downturn dampens consumer spending, it may open a relief valve for
a US economy that is boiling over, some analysts say. Last week,
the Labor Department reported that the consumer price index surged
in March by 0.7 percent, with the inflation driven only in part by
higher oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened over the past week is exactly what Greenspan
might've been looking for in terms of squeezing some of the excess
euphoria out of the market,'' Chioino said.
</P>
<P>
   The economy grew at a 7 percent annual rate in the fourth
quarter. Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. forecasts that may be followed with 6
percent annual growth in the first quarter of this year _ a
revision from a prior 5 percent forecast _ due to unusually high
consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
   Calling this performance ``really remarkable,'' John Youngdahl,
Goldman's senior money market economist, said, ``It remains to be
seen whether we've taken (the economy) off the boiler.''
</P>
<P>
   In the high-tech sector, a cooling off is inevitable, and it
will cause pain in hotbeds such as Boston, San Francisco, and
northern Virginia, economists say.
</P>
<P>
   They say Boston is in no danger of a crash like that experienced
in the late 1980s _ when minicomputer manufacturers, defense, and
housing went into a tailspin _ because the underlying economy is
sound.
</P>
<P>
   But funding for start-up software and Internet companies has
started to dry up, depriving them of money they would use to expand
and hire more workers. And employees at both large and small tech
companies have seen the value of their stock options plunge _
sometimes by half or more.
</P>
<P>
   The shakeout may cut into demand, too _ especially for high-end
housing, luxury automobiles, and mutual funds increasingly laden
with computer-company stocks, economists said. One of the largest
mutual funds, Fidelity Investments' Magellan fund, increased its
tech holdings during the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knows what the fallout is going to be. We've never been
through exactly this before, but we will be impacted,'' said Fred
Breimyer, chief economist for State Street Corp. ``The high-flying,
sky's-the-limit view of the economy and markets is getting a sober
reassessment.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's rebound followed a historically bad week in which the
index lost a quarter of its value. But the uncertainty remained,
measured by wilder and wilder swings in tech stocks during the past
year. And it has shaken confidence, in the near future, in the tech
industry.
</P>
<P>
   That could cause a sharp reversal in the tech industry's recent
hiring binge.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, tech employment has expanded to about 10
percent of all jobs, driving the jobless rate down to 3.1 percent _
a full point below the US rate. Job growth in the nonmanufacturing
areas of high tech, such as software, surged 10 percent annually
during the mid-1990s and is still growing a robust 7 percent a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The downside of that tech explosion, which coincided with a boom
in the Boston mutual fund industry, is the strain on the state's
labor market.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, businesses such as banks and health maintenance
organizations have a tough time competing for starry-eyed young
talent drawn to promises of stock options and early retirement in
the technology field.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's great demand for those skills,'' Matthews said. The
tech stock correction poses the question for the local economy of
``how smoothly the transition will be from decreases in employment
at dot-com companies to filling unfilled positions in more
traditional firms.''
</P>
<P>
   Pay tends to be higher than average for high-tech employees,
whose compensation also may include stock. If the industry stops
hiring, sales of luxury goods may decline or grow more slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If annual increases in the high double-digit range in the
stock market turn into a flattish market, that will cause the
consumer to be a little more circumspect and cautious,'' said
FleetBoston Financial's chief economist, Wayne Ayers.
</P>
<P>
   Well-paid tech and biotech employees have pushed up housing
prices. If fewer cash in options to buy homes, said Jon Southard,
senior economist for Torto Wheaton Research in Boston, the housing
market may calm down.
</P>
<P>
   The same holds true for commercial real estate around Boston,
where vacancy rates have plunged to 5.9 percent. That's down from
17 percent in 1991, with much of the surge in demand coming from a
dot-com and Internet boom that has stretched the market to its
limits and driven up rents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good time'' for a Nasdaq correction ``because things
are so tight,'' Southard said. ``It could result in a sort of
settling down, rather than a crash.''

NASDAQ DISASTER SHAKES WORLD OF STOCK OPTIONS, IPOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Friday afternoon, the employees of Boston's Zefer Corp. were
summoned to a meeting. It was to have been their IPO party.
</P>
<P>
   Caterers served wine and hors d'oeuvres for 200 in the Internet
consulting firm's downtown office. The top executives were back
after three weeks of wooing investors in 20 cities. Four hundred
colleagues in offices from San Francisco to London joined the
gathering by conference call.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no happy announcement. Instead, company officials
reported that the IPO was off.
</P>
<P>
   The news might have been shocking on any other day. But Nasdaq
stocks bled one quarter of their value last week, in the worst week
ever for the market that witnessed the dot-com boom and is now
seeing its bust.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were ready to go,'' said Zefer chief executive William
Seibel Jr. ``We saw an opportunity to go out there.
</P>
<P>
   We'll just wait for it to be back.''
</P>
<P>
   When the bruised technology sector will regain favor with
investors is the question bedeviling entrepreneurs, high-tech
workers, and investors from Boston to Silicon Valley. The market
for Internet-related stocks has tumbled 34 percent in a month, and
last week's massive losses sent shudders through the dot-com world.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies canceled stock offerings, while others worried
they'd run out of cash, unable to go back to the market to sell
more stock. Dot-com employers fretted about the waning appeal of
their stocks and options _ big selling points in recruiting and
retaining employees in the new economy.
</P>
<P>
   Every stock but one in the Globe's High-Tech 50 roster dove by
double digits last week. And it wasn't just the beleaguered
e-commerce companies. Sycamore Networks Inc., a telecommunications
company, lost 56 percent of its worth, as did Web-speed provider
Akamai Technologies Inc.
</P>
<P>
   On the West Coast, the young and disappointed drowned their
sorrows in microbrews at the Oasis Beer Garden in Menlo Park,
Calif. The Nasdaq free fall was the theme for last week's
not-so-happy hour, noted in e-mail invitations to dozens of dot-com
executives: ``Whining over market losses will engender sympathy.
There will be counseling for the afflicted.''
</P>
<P>
   Dark humor was the order of the evening, said Charles Wilson,
organizer of the weekly happy hour and vice president of marketing
for Pivia Inc., a Cupertino, Calif., Internet software company. So
was lamenting the fallen value of investment portfolios that hold
only Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like when you're taking an elevator, going down, and
there's this feeling of weightlessness right before the door
opens,'' said Wilson who, like so many at start-up companies, holds
options in his company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Gaw, research manager at International Data Corp. and a
regular at the happy hour, said: ``We talked about how there
haven't been any suicides because all of the buildings in Silicon
Valley are really short.''
</P>
<P>
   While ordinary investors bemoaned their paper losses in a
head-spinning week, insiders at high-tech companies tried to put a
brave face on the stock downturn. They noted that tech stock prices
may have gone too far, and that the market is merely back to where
it was a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been saying we didn't deserve this money and,
frankly, they were right,'' Gaw said. ``Technology used to be about
making cool stuff. Then a couple of years ago, it was about making
lots of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week's market tumble dashed many get-rich-quick dreams. And
there was little pity for the billionaire entrepreneurs ensnared in
the plunge. Chief executive David Wetherell's CMGI Inc. holdings
were slashed to $1.85 billion from nearly $4 billion in January.
Amazon.com chief Jeffrey Bezos's fortune has shrunk 59 percent
since December, to $5.51 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But the stock crash seems not to have dampened the spirits of
MBAs getting ready to join the technology wave. Some, though, say
they are mulling job prospects more carefully than a few months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Regnault, a 29-year-old student at MIT's Sloan School of
Management, said he plans to join Siebel Systems, a Silicon Valley
software company, after graduating next month. He shrugs off the
fact Siebel's shares have plummeted to $87 from $167 since March.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not joining this firm to make a million bucks in my first
six months,'' Regnault said.
</P>
<P>
   That's not what lots of people already working for high-tech
companies say. Many of them joined pre-IPO start-ups, in hopes of
reaping big gains on stock and options when their employers went
public.
</P>
<P>
   At LavaStorm Inc., a closely held Internet services firm in
Waltham, chief executive Miller Newton said too many tech-sector
employees assumed options alone would make them rich. ``A lot of
employees who get stock options just don't understand them, and it
does cause a morale problem'' when riches don't materialize, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   John Courtney, LavaStorm's vice president for marketing, has
worked for three other technology companies since 1997 and jumped
ship when none became big hits. He expects Nasdaq's recent declines
will prompt plenty of similar moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this hyper-environment, it's hard to pick up a newspaper
and read about an Amazon or an eBay's success and not feel like
you're missing the boat,'' Courtney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially if you have a a friend at another company that's
really doing well, you can really feel like you're missing the
boat, and you have to dog-paddle over and get on another boat,''
Courtney said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Wolfenberger, an investment banker with Credit Suisse First
Boston, who advised Zefer, said he got four calls on Thursday night
alone from CEOs who are worried about losing employees. Many
private employers say the recent stock selloff presents them with
an opportunity in this tight labor market.
</P>
<P>
   BizLand.com chief executive Steve Sydness said he's been able to
hire 55 people in recent months. ``We're seeing a lot of people
with underwater options trying to get into better positions,''
Sydness said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, chief executives were suddenly talking about
long-term goals and profits _ an anomaly in the realm of upstarts
and serial entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Furniture.com, which had planned to go public soon, put off its
IPO, fired 29 of its 200 employees in Framingham, Mass. and said
its days of free deliveries were over. Big furniture deliveries
will now come with a $95 delivery charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is looking for e-commerce companies to become much
more focused on the bottom line,'' company spokesman Don Goncalves
said. ``We've gone function by function throughout the business,
with an eye to fast-forwarding our path to profitablity.''
</P>
<P>
   Lower stock values could mean trouble for cash-strapped
start-ups. Young companies often run quickly through the cash they
raised in their IPOs, and a weak market means they may not be able
to go back for more. Forrester Research last week predicted that
half the e-commerce retailers that have sprung up will fail by the
end of 2001 next year.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon B. Hoffstein, chief executive of Be Free Inc., was
thanking his lucky stars that his company's secondary offering had
gone off well in February _ even as Be Free shares watched half
their value evaporate in a week.
</P>
<P>
   Coming barely three months after the Internet marketing services
company's initial public offering, the sale raised $100 million,
boosting Be Free's cash reserves to about $175 million. That's
enough to help weather additional market storms, Hoffstein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel lucky. We have the money to compete,'' Hoffstein said.
``I believe we'll still be around'' when the correction is over.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffstein's personal stake in Be Free has declined substantially
in the stock drop _ to $33.7 million from $208 million at the peak
_ but the stakes are different for multimillionaires than for more
earthly investors.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran of four computer-based companies in two decades, he
calls himself conservative with his own finances. At 47, he has no
mortgage on his house. He invests mainly in corporate bonds and
large blue-chip stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in personal debt,'' Hoffstein said. ``I am
much more conservative with my own money than I am in business. I
only play with money that been given to me to play with.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors are increasingly expecting companies to be more
careful with the money entrusted to them. Gautam Prakash, a partner
with Bessemer Venture Partners, said the stock slump reflected a
loss of confidence in start-ups that were overfunded by imprudent
venture capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very rude awakening,'' he said. ``It's not healthy
to my pocketbook or yours, but it will ring out the excesses of the
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology and innovation aren't going away, Prakash said. But
there's a much sharper focus on results now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CEO has to deal with questions that focus on the long
term,'' he said. ``It's not about a quick flip.''
</P>
<P>
   Private companies that do a good job will be able to get
continued funding from their venture capitalists to hold them over
until the market is better for public offerings, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfenberger, the investment banker, called Seibel and his
employees brave for delaying the coveted prize of the IPO.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes courage,'' he said, but it's best for the investors
and employees. ``It's harder to explain why you'd be willing to
give the company away at these levels.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, if a company goes public and its stock flops, it may
never come back.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Morse, director of an entrepreneurship center at MIT's Sloan
School of Management, has encouraged his students to see the recent
declines in technology stocks as a positive development.
</P>
<P>
   ``I welcome the shakeout, which separates the sheep from the
goats,'' Morse said. ``Now a line of bull and a Powerpoint
presentation won't be enough to get you funded anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good thing for the world and my students,'' Morse
said, ``because it means they'll go back to basics and create
sustainable businesses.''

BORN OUT OF NET FRUSTRATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALTHAM, Mass. _ Like millions of Web surfers, Eric Ziering has
endured the hellish experience of spending days searching the
Internet for information he knew for certain was out there
somewhere _ but darned if he was ever going to find it.
</P>
<P>
   Many people just throw up their hands in frustration at the
message, ``Your search returned 29,212 pages matching your terms.''
Ziering decided to do something about it.
</P>
<P>
   He started a company.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, he launched Fact City, now a 27-person start-up.
The company has rolled out what is apparently the Web's first
service (www.factcity.com) that can respond to a typed-in question
with an answer and an attributed source, usually in as little as a
tenth of a second.
</P>
<P>
   Fact City is not a search engine, but a company that sells its
service to search engines and portals.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, ESPN.com and Fox's sports Web page unveiled Fact
City-powered services that can take a baseball query and give an
attributed answer. Type in the question: ``How many game-winning
RBIs did Mo Vaughn hit in 1996?'' You'll get the answer: ``Thirteen
in 161 games for the Red Sox, according to STATS Inc.''
</P>
<P>
   Sports is only the beginning. In time, Fact City hopes to
provide Web-based access to Census population numbers, restaurant
listings, corporate financial statements, election results,
geography facts, crime statistics, movie trivia _ basically any
kind of information you could imagine looking up in a book full of
tables.
</P>
<P>
   The world is seeing a mad rush to develop search engines that
will find the needle in the Internet haystack, which now totals
something like 1.5 billion pages of information.
</P>
<P>
   Besides such meta-search engines as Googol and Northern Light
that try to organize results from multiple searches, one of the
better-known attempts to respond to questions is Ask Jeeves. But it
mainly works by steering you toward the half-dozen Web sites that
seem most likely to answer your question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask Jeeves pretends they're like Fact City, but they're not,''
says Robin Schreier Hohman, an analyst with The Hurwitz Group in
Framingham who specializes in Web search engines. ``Fact City is
the first one I have seen that answers a specific problem that has
not been addressed yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Among services that try to get you to human beings through the
Net, AskMe.com in Seattle offers access to 30,000 experts who
answer questions. But it can take a while to wait for an answer to
come back. And trusting the source can be an issue.
</P>
<P>
   A host of companies are developing systems allowing you to find
the, say, 29 online retailers that sell men's argyle sweaters or
the dozen ISPs serving your town. And don't forget the helpful live
people at the Boston Public Library reference desk who can answer
millions of questions over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   With Fact City, ``you've got answers, not hyperlinks,'' said
Ziering, 42, a database-design veteran formerly with computer audio
start-up Cakewalk Software. ``We're allowing you to get to actual
databases, many of which are not on the Web anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that making money has suddenly become a less quaint idea for
dot-com start-ups, Fact City has a profit-minded business model. It
involves sharing banner-ad dollars during the presumably much
longer time people would spend using a Fact City-enhanced search
site, or perhaps getting bounties when people pursue answers to
source pages.
</P>
<P>
   Ziering launched the company soon after he tried to get some
information from the Web on personal computer ownership in New
England communities. That was in November 1998, when he was
thinking of launching a consumer Internet company.
</P>
<P>
   Today he says he can't even remember what the idea was. But in
his frustration with being unable to use the Web to find data he
knew had to be out there somewhere, Ziering saw a huge business
opportunity in creating a company that would get useful answers
from the Net.
</P>
<P>
   The technology that drives Fact City is subject to several
pending patents. Executives acknowledge it is best suited for
mining specific facts from rows and columns in a table, not
answering a subjective question like ``Where can I get a listing of
Cape Cod golf resorts?'' or a request for articles from magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of them as an empty database waiting to be populated by
whatever information is out there,'' said Schreier Hohman. ``What
it can't do is crawl the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   In essence, Fact City technology uses fairly rudimentary
language analysis to interpret your question as a request to find
the piece of information that lies at the intersection of several
lines of data, like names, years, places, and numbers.
</P>
<P>
   You don't even have to add a question mark or use exactly the
right term: Punch in ``Pete Rose career whiffs'' and you'll get how
many strikeouts Charlie Hustle racked up.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, Fact City, whose management team includes veterans
of Lycos, Motorola, and Torrent Systems, hopes to launch services
linking its search technology to entertainment sites, including
information about movies, television shows, and music.
</P>
<P>
   The company also has its eye on incorporating speech recognition
technology so that you could call a site on a wireless phone, ask a
question, and have the answer shot back as a message to the phone
screen. Another option could be studding online sports reports with
hyperlinks to every statistic you would ever want to know about an
athlete mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to respond to probably 80 percent of what
comes through a search engine,'' Ziering said. ``But when we don't
have any information, we have to be able to say `no' very fast. The
only question is: How much data do we load into our warehouse?''
</P>

US GROUP SEES A NEW KIND OF CIVIC EDUCATION IN CUBA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JORDANA HART  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA _ The Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Center is a
spartan place. Eight white fans whir softly in the meeting hall,
and metal shutters are closed against the tropical heat enveloping
Pogolotti, the capital's historic Afro-Cuban neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   There are no posters of Castro or Che, no obvious signs of
revolutionary euphoria in the community center, only a simple,
painted portrait of King, robed and serious-looking as he stares
out across the hall.
</P>
<P>
   That a community center bearing the name of the slain civil
rights leader is the driving force behind a new brand of civic
education here makes perfect sense, says Raul Suarez, the Baptist
minister who runs the center.
</P>
<P>
   Suarez's power in these parts is clear: He is not a Communist
Party member but has twice been elected to parliament by a
neighborhood district that loves him.
</P>
<P>
   The center, he said, emphasizes the principles of personal
responsibility and community organization and leadership, though he
is careful to note that the work is done in the ``spirit of
revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Naming the center after King in 1969, the year after the civil
rights leader was slain, was an obvious decision, Suarez said.
After all, King was known already in Cuba as a heroic black man who
preached nonviolence and reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything for us right now is about reconciliation,'' said
Suarez, a small forthright man who has been a minister for 41
years.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday afternoon, Suarez stood before Representative James
McGovern and 48 presidents and scholars from universities across
Massachusetts. They sat in a large circle, the largest delegation
of US educators to visit Cuba in at least 40 years. They are here
to consider establishing exchange progams with Cuban scholars and
students, their way, they said, to promote an end to the four
decades of US economic sanctions against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believed in 1979, and I believe now, that our policy doesn't
make sense,'' said McGovern, the Worcester Democrat who organized
the five-day trip with Representative J. Joseph Moakley, Democrat
of South Boston, and the Washington Office on Latin America, a
nonprofit organization that promotes human rights, democracy and
social justice in the region. ``It has sustained Castro for 40
years as a convenient excuse. Every time things get tough, the
embargo is the excuse,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Unusual in Cuba, the King center is, by all accounts, free of
ties to the Castro regime in that it sustains itself with thousands
of dollars donated by Oxfam as well as humanitarian groups from
Canada, Norway and the Netherlands. Some American relief workers
here describe the center's ties with the Castro regime as an
``uncomfortable friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   The King center does the unusual work of seeking to get Cubans,
accustomed to looking to government for basic needs like food,
cheap housing and health care, to assume more personal
responsibility. Suarez brings in academics and community leaders
from the United States and abroad, even sympathetic US leaders, to
help train a small cadre of Cubans on how to organize meetings, use
media such as videotape, and use methods of attracting regular
folks to the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The hall where the Americans sat Sunday still resonates with the
voices of Congresswoman Maxine Waters, Congressman Charles Rangel,
Jesse Jackson and Castro himself, all of whom addressed Cubans who
packed the hall to hear them. Mel King, the MIT professor and
Boston community organizer, has visited the center three times,
most recently in November to run workshops.
</P>
<P>
   McGovern and the others listened to Suarez's mixture of
revolutionary fervor sliced with declarative support for social
change. ``No country has such a perfect democracy that it should be
exported everywhhere,'' Suarez said. ``Every country has to look
for its own process based on its own reality. We have promoted this
idea and brought it to our president. We want change, but it must
come from within and from a spirit of revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Suarez also pushed for more powerful activism among US churches,
many of which he said are already largely opposed to the embargo _
and supportive of sending Elian Gonzalez home to Cuba with his
father.
</P>
<P>
   ``The churches have been with us on these issues and created an
opinion that the US government has had to listen to,'' Suarez said.
``The churches will begin to shake the power of members of your
government.''
</P>
<P>
   In a judicious way, Suarez seems to be trying that tactic here.
In the center's neighborhood, for example, Suarez and others have
trained local people to work with neighbors to build basic houses,
a direct response to the critical housing shortage in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the US delegates said the training appears to lay the
groundwork for preparing Cubans as their country opens up. But some
also noted that it is also important for Cubans to learn to fend
for themselves as it become clearer they can depend less and less
on their government to provide food and other basics for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to Central America, we are not dealing with such poor
people here, but they do need to be mobilized,'' said Miren
Uriarte, a sociology professor at the University of Massachusetts
in Boston. Uriarte, who is Cuban-American, returned to live here
between 1994 and 1997 as part of an exchange program with the
University of Havana. She was among the first to train Suarez and
help him develop the center.
</P>
<P>
   Every year since 1992, some 200 Cubans have traveled from across
the island for week-long training sessions at the center. Uriarte
said those who finish the training go back to their hometowns and
become watchdogs of sorts, for example, making sure that bakeries
and pharmacies are stocked with goods.
</P>
<P>
   Suarez likes the notion of this web of civic-minded Cubans
teaching others. But he said that as foreigners become more
involved, they must let the process continue the Cuban way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are accompanying the Cuban people in a prophetic way,'' he
told the Americans. ``Cuba is not the hell some make it, but it is
not the Kingdom of God either. Cubans need to learn more, but with
the respect from the US for our ways.''

   A look at five of the top contenders for the Kentucky Derby, to
be run May 6 at Churchill Downs:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL; 
FUSAICHI PEGASUS &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Breeding: Mr. Prospector-Angel Fever (Danzig). Owner: Fusao
Sekiguchi. Trainer: Neil Drysdale. Jockey: Kent Desormeaux. Last
race: Won Wood Memorial at Aqueduct Saturday. Next race: Kentucky
Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Dazzled in New York after dominating in California.
Imposing physical specimen is unquestionably the one to beat in the
Run for the Roses. We'll see how he and his connections hold up as
the pressure builds. Is he Arazi, or is he Affirmed?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL; 
THE DEPUTY &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Breeding: PetardiaGB-ManfaithIre (Last TycoonIre). Owner: Team
Valor Stable and Gary Barber. Trainer: Jenine Sahadi. Jockey: Chris
McCarron. Last race: Won Santa Anita Derby April 8. Next race:
Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Began career sprinting on turf in England. Came to
Santa Anita for 3-year-old campaign and won dirt debut. Proved he
is genuine by finishing less than a length behind Fusaichi Pegasus
in San Felipe March 19. Went on to win $1 million Santa Anita Derby
in a very professional performance under excellent handling by
McCarron.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL; 
WAR CHANT &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Breeding: Danzig-Hollywood Wildcat (Kris S). Owner: Majorie and
Irving Cowan. Trainer: Drysdale. Jockey: Jerry Bailey. Last race:
Second in Santa Anita Derby. Next Race: Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Won first three starts, then ran second to The Deputy,
beaten a length after taking a short lead, in Santa Anita Derby.
Appears to have a world of talent and should only improve with
additional training. Runs right on the pace but does not have to be
in front to do his best.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL; 
HIGH YIELD &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Breeding: Storm Cat-Scoop The Gold (Forty Niner). Owner: Bob and
Beverly Lewis, Michael Tabor, and Mrs. John Magnier. Trainer: D.
Wayne Lukas. Jockey: Pat Day. Last race: Won Blue Grass at
Keeneland Saturday. Next race: Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Has experience, having run 12 times, eight as a
2-year-old. Always tries hard, grinding it out in the first flight,
and has been in the money 11 times (4-4-3). The only time he was
off the board, he was roughed up at the break. The Lewises,
racing's top ambassadors, and Lukas combined to win last year's
Derby with Charismatic.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL; 
CAPTAIN STEVE &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Breeding: Fly So Free-Sparkling Delite (Vice Regent). Owner:
Michael Pegram. Trainer: Bob Baffert. Jockey: Robbie Albarado. Last
race: Third in Santa Anita Derby. Next race: Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Has 11 career starts (4-0-5) and finished with good
energy in the Santa Anita Derby. Is another who is consistent and
can turn it on late. Has not won this year, with three straight
thirds, but seems to be going in the right direction. Baffert and
Pegram combined to win 1998 Derby with Real Quiet, and Baffert also
trained 1997 Derby winner Silver Charm, who was owned by the
Lewises.
</P>
<P>

TWO DISTINCT WAYS TO LOOK AT THE KENTUCKY DERBY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are two ways to look at Kentucky Derby 2000. Either
Fusaichi Pegasus is a cinch, and all the other horses are running
for second money, or the race is wide open. If an observer doesn't
believe that Fusaichi Pegasus is the next Secretariat, there are at
least 10 other 3-year-olds who have a chance to wear the blanket of
roses on the first Saturday in May. They are: Anees, Aptitude,
Captain Steve, China Visit, High Yield, Impeachment, Mighty, More
Than Ready, The Deputy, and War Chant.
</P>
<P>
   There is ample evidence that Fusaichi Pegasus, a son of the
late, great Mr. Prospector, is a monster. He was a $4 million
yearling, which attests to his looks and confirmation; and, after
losing his first start by a neck, he has won four straight races
impressively. He defeated The Deputy, who went on to win the Santa
Anita Derby, in the San Felipe March 19, then made a lot of
converts with a strong tally over Red Bullet in the Wood Memorial
at Aqueduct Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The connections of Red Bullet, who was defeated for the first
time in four starts, certainly believe Fusaichi Pegasus is the real
deal. They withdrew the promising son of Unbridled from Derby
consideration Monday. ``We looked at everything, and decided to do
what is best for the horse, and not to just follow our hearts,''
said Joe Orseno, who trains Red Bullet for Frank Stronach and his
son, Andy. ``I think it says a lot about the Stronachs. How many
people would pass on a chance to run in the Kentucky Derby in order
to preserve the welfare and longevity of a horse?''
</P>
<P>
   Red Bullet will be pointed straight to the Preakness, at Pimlico
May 20. ``This will give us five weeks to get Red Bullet ready,''
said Orseno. ``He'll be a fresh horse going against horses that
will have had a tough race in the Kentucky Derby. Our goal is the
3-year-old championship, and I really believe that when we look
back, we'll all feel we made the right decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Bullet ran well in the Wood, but Fusaichi Pegasus ran right
past him at the eighth-pole, drawing away to score by more than 4
lengths. ``He was very fluid all the way around,'' said Kent
Desormeaux, who rides Fusaichi Pegasus. ``On the turn, he just
reached forward, and went after the targets. At that point I was
really confident. He did everything I asked in fine fashion. He's
certainly got a world of talent. The only question now is: Can he
get the mile and one-quarter? I think so. But it's a question we'll
have to answer on the first Saturday in May.''
</P>
<P>
   Which horse can handle 10 furlongs is always the key question at
the Derby, but Fusaichi Pegasus has other issues. He is headstrong,
and he balked, standing still at times, going to the gate and
coming back to the winners circle. A high-strung horse often leaves
his race in the paddock when he looks around and sees 150,000 noisy
spectators crowding every corner of Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a bit of a mind of his own, and he loves to look and
stare at things,'' said Neil Drysdale, who trains Fusaichi Pegasus
for Japanese entrepreneur Fusao Sekiguchi. ``We sent him to the
track with a different pony. He should have gone with his own pony,
and, next race, we'll send him with the pony he's accustomed to. He
doesn't get excited, he just gets to looking around. It's like he's
saying: `I'll come when I'm ready.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The drumbeat has just started for Fusaichi Pegasus, who was
flown to Louisville Monday. He was 4-5 in the Wood Memorial, and,
by the time the hype ends, he'll be odds-on in the Derby, too. The
choice is simple. You can try to beat him, or you can join him.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pool closed
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The third and final Kentucky Derby Future Wager pool closed
Monday with Fusaichi Pegasus favored at 3-1. The odds on the Wood
winner are the lowest in the two years that the pool, which is
sponsored by Churchill Downs, has been conducted. The Deputy was
next at 6-1, followed by High Yield at 11-1. The field, which is
composed of any nominee not listed in the top 23 selected by a
panel of handicappars, stood at 12-1.
</P>
<P>
   One of the challenges of a future bet is that you lose if your
horse does not make the race, regardless of the reason. Those who
bet on Red Bullet, who closed at 18-1, lost Monday when his camp
declared it was holding him out.
</P>
<P>
   Combined wagering on the three pools was $1,158,919, up from
$676,233 last year. This year's third pool set the individual
record, with $387,206 wagered.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Four on the floor?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Todd Pletcher could have as many as four chances to pull
an upset in the Run for the Roses. Even D. Wayne Lukas would be
envious. Pletcher trains More Than Ready, Impeachment, Trippi, and
Graeme Hall, all apparantly headed to the Derby. Impeachment and
Trippi, who is an undefeated (4 for 4) front-runner, are owned by
Dogwood Stable, and would race as an entry. The other two are
privately owned. More Than Ready was second in the Blue Grass at
Keeneland; Impeachment was third in the Arkansas Derby at Oaklawn;
Trippi won the Flamingo at Gulfstream, and Graeme Hall won the
Arkansas Derby. ``It really hasn't sunk in yet,'' said Pletcher.
``It's hard to get one horse to the Derby. To have four in the same
year is really unbelievable to me. It's just been one of those
years where everything has come together at just the right time,
and things have gone well. I guess we'll have a pretty busy Derby
week, won't we?'' . . . Louisiana Derby winner Mighty, and Florida
Derby winner Hal's Hope, were major disappointments in the Blue
Grass. Mighty, who hit the side of the gate coming out, was
seventh, and Hal's Hope was eighth and last. ``He's fine, perfect,
couldn't be better,'' said Frank Brothers, who trains Mighty. ``I'm
not one to make excuses for my horses, but it could have been the
racetrack. He didn't seem comfortable running over it.'' ``I don't
know what happened in the race,'' said Harold Rose, the 88-year-old
trainer of Hal's Hope. ``He came out of it without a scratch. Maybe
the Florida Derby took more out of him than I thought.''

ETHIOIPIAN, KENYANS SPAR DURING AND AFTER THE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The drama began in Framingham, in front of a Magnavox
store. That was the point at which a cluster of runners _ most of
them Kenyans _ passed early leader Makoto Sasaki and quickly
determined the winning pace of the Boston Marathon Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It was fitting that this took place near a television shop,
because the men's race was teeming with made-for-TV possibilities.
There was a great Jenny Craig-inspired medical story. There was a
great ending, with three seconds separating the top three
finishers. There was also a great case of whining.
</P>
<P>
   Elijah Lagat, a 33-year-old Kenyan, won the race in 2:09:47. A
22-year-old Ethiopian, Gezahenge Abera, had the same time and
finished second. Two-time winner Moses Tanui, also Kenyan, was
three seconds behind the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   With their fascinating challenging of each other over the final
4 miles, the three men thrilled the chilled souls who watched them
fight fatigue and a vicious headwind. They were on Beacon Street
and it wasn't clear who would win. They were on Boylston Street and
it wasn't clear who would win. They were a few hundred feet from
the finish and it was still in doubt. But this was one of those
classics in which the winner was the only one who could truly enjoy
it afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was running between two Kenyans, and had a hard time dealing
with some pushing and kicking,'' Abera said through an interpreter.
``I can't say if the pushing and kicking was intentional, but with
one (Kenyan) in front and one behind, that was a strain on my
muscles, and resulted in me not finishing first.''
</P>
<P>
   In this scenario, let's hope that something was lost in the
translation. Abera doesn't really believe that, does he? It is true
that the Kenyans dominate Boston. At the beginning of races, they
run as a collective. Trying to get by them is like trying to pass a
fleet of 18-wheelers; you don't pass unless they let you.
</P>
<P>
   This, understandably, can lead to some road rage. Especially if
it happens for the better part of 26.2 miles. But, according to
Tanui, that didn't happen. He said he was kicked and stepped on as
well, but that's part of being in the lead. He also said at one
point he stepped aside so Abera could get by, but the runner chose
to follow him instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is accusing Kenyans,'' an angry Tanui said when told of
Abera's remarks. ``These are his problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the race was an Olympic qualifier for the Kenyans, Tanui
is now an Olympian despite his finish. He was asked if there is any
solace in the fact that he will be in Sydney this year. He paused
for a while and then said, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't quite admit it, but he was shocked that he lost to
Lagat. The two are friends and have trained together. But Lagat is
a self-described former fat kid who started running to save his
life. As recently as 1993, Lagat did not consider himself an
athlete (``I was not an athlete; I was fat.''). He said he lost
weight but, ``I was not doing it to be an athlete; I was doing it
for the sake of the doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   Lagat was having difficulty breathing when he saw his doctor. He
was told that his excess weight could lead to death or heart
problems. So he began running because he liked the exercise. As
recently as 1997, the resident of Kenya's Nandi District was
employed by the Ministry of Education. He was teaching when Tanui
was coming off his first Boston win in '96. Now, the former Heavy E
has a wreath of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Tanui was asked if losing to Lagat surprised him. He said it was
a tough question, and that the only thing that matters is that
Lagat won.
</P>
<P>
   The win was the 10th straight here for Kenyans. It shouldn't
surprise anyone if that streak grows to 20. Consider that last
year's winner, Joseph Chebet, is considered the top runner in the
world. He finished eighth, overshadowed by a marathoning neophyte.
That should give everyone an indication of how much talent there is
in East Africa. It also should be obvious to the Kenyans that,
because of their success, one theme is here to stay: Drama.
</P>
<P>
   As the Kenyans continue to dominate, more accusations will come.
That always happens to extraordinary performers. There will be more
Aberas, saying that a Kenyan conspiracy led to a loss. There will
also be increasing jealousy and contempt.
</P>
<P>
   But as many runners from the Great Rift Valley are happy to tell
you, the reason they do so well on Boston's hilly course is,
simply, that it reminds them of home. There are temperature
differences and cultural differences, but running here is like
training for them.
</P>
<P>
   There was a slight Marathon alteration for the Kenyans. This one
called for a dramatic ending. But, really, how much mystery was
involved? At the end of the day, you still knew a Kenyan was going
to win.

<P>
   BOSTON _ There were thousands of them, and they had as much of a
chance as a snowball in you-know-where.
</P>
<P>
   They were the men and women running for personal pride or for a
cause. They were the familiar faces being cheered on by families
and friends and complete strangers. They're here every year.
</P>
<P>
   They're ``The Pack,'' and they make the Boston Marathon the
great race that it is.
</P>
<P>
   And on a day that started cold and got colder with each passing
mile, many of them dropped out, unable to cope with the blustery
conditions. Many more, though, plodded their way to the finish
line, where they sought to share their joy with anyone willing to
share it with them.
</P>
<P>
   Then they walked, or shuffled, or were wheeled to the massage
tents, where tender fingers kneaded aching muscles. All were
wrapped in Mylar blankets and most were shivering and talking
through chattering teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of their stories.
</P>
<P>
   --Randy Walker, 41, Windsor, Ontario: ``This was my first Boston
and it was a wonderful day. A little cool, but the crowds along the
way certainly warmed things up. I've never seen crowds like that
along any marathon route. When things get tough and you think
you're ready to throw in the towel, they cheer you on to keep
going. They were incredible. That's what makes this whole race so
special. The fans, the volunteers, and the runners. It's quite a
course. Heartbreak Hill was everything I heard it would be. Your
quads get pounded. All in all, a great experience.''
</P>
<P>
   --Kristie Camp, 24, Provo, Utah: ``My first Boston, and I hope
it's not my last. I loved it. A swarm of people everywhere. The
cold didn't bother me too much. I actually took my long-sleeve
shirt off at about Mile 7 and I just warmed up. The wind at the
end, though, was a little chilly. I found the whole course
motivating because of the encouragement from the spectators all
over. They made me feel like I was winning the race. They certainly
know how to spur you on. I knew I wasn't going to win, but those
spectators treat you the same as the elite runners.''
</P>
<P>
   --Steve Robinson, 27, Irvine, Calif.: ``I knew it was cold, but
the adrenaline kicks in and makes it feel a lot warmer than it is.
As you got closer to Boston, though, the headwind was real
chilling. What amazed me most was the support of the people along
the way. Everywhere you looked there were people, and they cheer
for you even though they don't know you. There weren't too many
spots where it wasn't fully packed. I've run other marathons and
have never seen anything like this. Nothing even close. Heartbreak
Hill was a killer. There were a couple of hills before that and I
thought, `Hey, that wasn't too bad.' Then I hit it and I knew why
they call it Heartbreak Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   --Susan Stecina, 31, Phoenix: ``My first Boston Marathon and my
first trip to Boston and both are everything I was told they'd be.
I don't know what the temperature was when we started, but coming
from Phoenix, let me tell you, it was freezing. I was very cold at
the start and it just kept getting colder. The wind was a factor
for me. The crowds were great and that, combined with the fact that
this is Boston, made it exciting. I liked the course, I liked the
hills, even though they beat up your quads. I had been warned so
much about Heartbreak Hill and I just tried to hang in there and
not let it get me down. Everyone in the pack sets their own goals
and they don't compete with other people, they compete with
themselves. Everyone's out to run their own race. This is the only
marathon I've ever run, with maybe the exception of New York, where
on every inch of the course there's somebody cheering for you. And
I'm a complete stranger. It was beyond what I ever imagined.''

 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The news that knocked the market for a loop on Friday was a
government report that showed the underlying inflation in the
consumer price index rising in March at its fastest rate in five
years.
</P>
<P>
   What are the chances that the report was a fluke?
</P>
<P>
   Alas, not very good. With concern for the health of the
underlying US economy about to replace the pleasant euphoria of the
last six months, each new bit of data now will be scrutized with
the same kind of gimlet eye that last week cost the stock markets
$2 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Since virtually every recession since World War II has been
precipitated by a Federal Reserve Board determined to prevent a
still bigger crash by sharply raising short-term interest rates, a
suspenseful watch will be instituted.
</P>
<P>
   Can the Fed engineer yet another ``soft-landing?'' Or must the
longest expansion in history come to a painful end? The answer,
economists agree, depends on an intricate web of relationships that
simply are not very well understood, between stock market
valuations and consumer psychology.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer prices jumped 0.7 percent last month _ not, by itself,
a particularily persuasive indicator of a trend. The next major
readout of economic activity will be the manufacturing productivity
report for the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer England, who tracks government statistics for his Equity
Review, says that he expects it to be barely half of the robust
10.3 percent reported for the fourth quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Since only soaring productivity in the last few years has
enabled employers to pay higher wages without raising prices,
slowing productivity growth would be interpreted as a harbinger of
more inflation, since compensation costs already are rising at
increasing rates.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with rising inflation and falling productivity, the Fed
could have to tighten more dramatically, perhaps by as much as half
a point when they meet next May 16. The Fed already has increased
rates five times by a quarter point since last June in an attempt
to slow the bouyant spending that has been caused in part by
soaring stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   To understand changing attitudes towards the stock market,
you`ve got to understand that for most of the last year, the stock
market has enjoyed a holiday from ordinary economics.
</P>
<P>
   It was last September that the technology-rich Nasdaq composite
came unhitched from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, beginning a
dizzying upward march that had it doubling by mid-March, while the
Dow traded in a relatively narrow range.
</P>
<P>
   Many stories have been told to explain those values, but all had
one thing in common. They depended on continued low inflation to
protect the value of the future earnings streams for which
investors were paying record prices.
</P>
<P>
   When Alan Greenspan testified in Congress on Thursday, he said,
``If you look at the underlying cost structure of American
business, I see no evidence of an acceleration in unit costs.'' It
was in that context that Friday morning's announcement of the CPI
constituted such bad news.
</P>
<P>
   But didn't the strong performance Monday of both the Dow and the
Nasdaq signal that the long bull market still has a way to run? Not
necessarily. Despite the indexes, the broad market was Monday
decisively negative, with declining stocks outnumbering advancers
on both exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, bear markets are notoriously deceptive, holding out the
prospect of further advance for days and weeks at a time, before
settling to lower levels. First quarter earning reports may take
center stage for a time, before yielding the spotlight to
underlying economic data.
</P>
<P>
   The basic fact of the stock market remains that price-earnings
ratios are at historic highs _ nearly thirty times earnings in the
broad market, compared to a historic average closer to eighteen
times earnings. Periods of such rosy outlooks are not uncommon in
the history of the market; they can last for extended periods of
time. But they cannot withstand a determined Fed tightening.
</P>
<P>
   What price would bring valuations back in line with potential
earnings growth, adjusted for low inflation? Franco Modigliani of
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology estimates that a Dow of
around 9000 would do it.

THE TRICK NOW IS PICKING OUT TECH BARGAINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One thing we can say with certainty about all those clobbered
technology stocks: Some are bargains, but others will languish or
fare even worse in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Telling them apart is the trick.
</P>
<P>
   Some extreme cases are obvious, either hopeless or
indiscriminately punished. But the bulk of the technology stock
market lies battered somewhere in-between.
</P>
<P>
   Ask professional investors how to separate the winners from
losers, and you will get a lot of different answers. But we heard a
smaller handful of issues popping up in one call after another.
Here are three of them.
</P>
<P>
   --Potential versus performance _ The answer isn't quite as
clean-cut as you might think.
</P>
<P>
   Actual financial performance clearly counts for more than
anything else now. That means earnings where you can get them, but
at least a pattern of accelerating revenues that would lead
reasonable investors to believe profits are around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   The tech stock rebound Monday may have been real or temporary.
But it was certainly driven by rising stock prices for very
profitable companies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, professional investors said they weren't giving up on all
companies without immediate prospects of any earnings. The catch,
they said, is the need for some tangible measure of robust business
growth, such as product orders, that can become the basis of a real
valuation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between aggressive investing and speculating is
whether you can get your arms around it fundamentally,'' said Fred
Kobrick.
</P>
<P>
   --Small versus large _ Hands down, larger technology stocks are
the better short-term bet, but that could change depending on how
long you're willing to wait.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual funds and other institutional investors sold some big
tech stocks last week because they were the most liquid and easiest
to unload.
</P>
<P>
   But those investors prefer big names and tend to gravitate back
toward them. No one is counting on institutions to take many
small-stock tech gambles right away, and no one is sure how
individual investors will react.
</P>
<P>
   ``Institutions have to go back to the most liquid names,'' said
David Smith, a money manager with Loomis Sayles in Boston. ``But
that's not to say over the next 12 to 18 months investors can't
make as good or better returns'' in smaller tech stocks. ``The
growth rates are much more dynamic at the smaller companies.''
</P>
<P>
   --Technology themes vs. individual performance _ Investment
themes drove huge sums of money into certain types of technology
stocks over the last year, often with little regard to the quality
of the individual businesses.
</P>
<P>
   High-speed telecommunciations, various corners of the Internet,
and biotechnology were all embraced as the places for investors to
be at one time or another. The good and the mediocre were bid up in
unison and usually dumped like hot potatoes the same way months
later.
</P>
<P>
   Investors won't be so indiscriminant about individual companies
this time, but themes will continue to play a big role in what
stocks are purchased.
</P>
<P>
   There is a tech stock theme at work right now, harder to see in
the confusion of the moment but still protecting some companies
from a deeper slide than they might have faced.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that make semiconductors or equipment used in the
manufacture of semiconductors are the clear favorites today. Most
did not fall as steeply as other tech stocks and, if Monday's
performance is any gauge, are first in line to bounce back up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their business is booming,'' said Alan Lowenstein, co-manager
of the John Hancock Global Technology fund. ``You probably have a
good 18 months of very good earnings growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Two local semiconductor equipment makers moved higher Monday.
Teradyne Inc. of Boston gained $11.8125 to $87.25; PRI Automation
Inc. of Billerica advanced $7 to $63.125.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Red Herring
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The tech stock bear market seems to be having an impact in the
venture capital world already.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Lax, the general partner in Softbank Capital Partners,
said he pulled three term sheets for proposed venture funding of
business-to-business oriented Internet companies in the last four
days.
</P>
<P>
   Lax's fund focuses on late-stage venture funding. He said he
pulled the plug because initial public offerings that had been
anticipated for those companies by late this year no longer seemed
likely.

PLENTY OF DEBATE OVER NASDAQ'S PLAN TO GO PUBLIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Nasdaq may be in a hair-raising free fall, but that isn't
stopping the high-tech stock market from marching toward its own
IPO _ kind of like planning a wedding while your best friends'
marriages are falling apart.
</P>
<P>
   Timing is only part of the trouble, however. Nasdaq's plan to
become a for-profit company _ and ultimately to go public _ was
controversial long before its listed stocks started dropping off
the cliff.
</P>
<P>
   What peeves the critics most is how shares of Nasdaq have been
divvied up. It used to be one brokerage, one vote, at the
electronic market. Now giants like Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs
_ and newly invited owners, like Microsoft Corp. and Fidelity
Investments _ will have far more voting shares than regional
brokers.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody wants to talk about exactly how many shares they got,
shares that will one day become public shares.
</P>
<P>
   A small but feisty contingent of brokerage firms is against the
revamping of Nasdaq. John Goldsmith, chief executive of Freedom
Securities Corp. in Boston, says he bought the shares that were
allotted to Freedom. (Not to do so would be to cut oneself out of
the picture altogether.) But he voted no for the reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not of the school that this is a good idea,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He and scores of others lost their protest vote Friday, as Wall
Street's titans prevailed in a 3,423-to-652 contest. But their
gripe remains: Who came up with this mysterious formula to dole out
stakes in the nation's hottest _ if presently swooning _ market?
</P>
<P>
   The eight fellows who did the math were part of what was called
(no kidding) the ``fairness committee.'' The group's chairman was
Harvard University's Robert Glauber. The rest included a banker, an
oil magnate, and the head of an individual investors' association.
</P>
<P>
   Another group, called the Baxter Committee _ dominated by
executives from places like Merrill, Microsoft, Salomon Smith
Barney, and Intel _ rubber-stamped the fairness proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Some say the handing of the most power to the biggest players is
no surprise. John Adams, chief of Adams, Harkness &AMP; Hill, a Boston
broker and investment banker, says: ``We got a fair shake.'' He
argues that pure democracy doesn't help reward the firms most
responsible for Nasdaq's success: ``If Merrill took their volume
somewhere else, it would hurt all of us a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is plenty of debate over why Nasdaq needs to go public
at all. The New York Stock Exchange is mulling an IPO as well. The
exchanges say they need capital to compete with the upstart
electronic exchanges. But is the strategy adequately thought out?
As so many companies found out this week, going public is not just
an opportunity to raise money. It comes with responsibilities to
provide returns to investors.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Sam Hayes of Harvard Business School observes: ``I
think there's a real problem with being a profit center and also a
market regulator.'' He asks: ``How can you keep those different
roles separate but connected?''
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq's defenders retort that the watchdog role will be
separate. But that is far from clear. The National Association of
Securities Dealers, Nasdaq's parent, is a self-regulatory body
financed by its members. It's a bit like a mutual bank owned by its
customers _ in this case, the brokerage firms. Even after Nasdaq
goes public, the NASD will own 22 percent of the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible to be a major Nasdaq owner and to be an unbiased
regulator of its member firms? Consider this: Some current and
former NASD regulators were part of the lobbying machine to get out
the yes vote last week.
</P>
<P>
   For Nasdaq to thrive as a public company, it must lose its image
as a place rife with conflicts and power struggles. And to compete
with other markets and electronic networks, it must run more like
the businesses it lists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a world that's changing,'' says Richard Syron, the former
American Stock Exchange chief who now is chairman of Thermo
Electron Corp. and who helped merge Amex into Nasdaq. ``It's moving
faster because of the competitive environment and because of
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a huge challenge for Nasdaq's old guard.

 &HT;    This old house
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Chicken Little was right. The sky is falling
_ all over the kitchen floor. Welcome to another episode of ``My
Old House.''
</P>
<P>
   The day dawned clear, and the sun rose in the east _ a good omen
for spring cleaning I hear. My helper Elaine and I were hard at it
_ she washing woodwork and vacuuming radiators downstairs while I
put the final touches on the upstairs bathroom _ the only one in
the house with a tub. Keep that in mind _ it's a clue. It couldn't
have been more than three seconds after I put down the last clean
rug, when I heard Elaine call. ``Elizabeth, you'd better come here.
There's a crack in the kitchen ceiling and water's dripping through
the plaster into the cat's food dish.''
</P>
<P>
   Believe me when I tell you there are any number of things the
owner of an 84-year-old house would rather hear than the sound of
water dripping _ anywhere _ but particularly through the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   My stomach churned _ I guess because my heart had just dropped
into it _ as we stood transfixed, watching each drop wiggle its way
through the fissure and fall to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly my entire wicked life began to flash before me. I
recoiled from the memory of the time I'd taken a nickel in change
out of the Sunday school collection plate and then gotten it stuck
in my windpipe. Mother liked to say I'd have choked to death if
there hadn't been a firehouse right across the street.
</P>
<P>
   Contrition for every breach of good manners and other rotten
acts, draped itself over me like a shroud. I even whispered an
apology to Phyllis Hofstedter for the time I flushed her Monopoly
tokens down the toilet because she'd never let me use the flat
iron.
</P>
<P>
   This must be the kind of stuff folks think about when they're
singing hymns on the deck of a sinking ship. Underneath the bravado
is abject penitence. And a little deal making _ ``I promise never
to... whatever...if this leak will stop.''
</P>
<P>
   For a brief moment I even had a nightmarish vision of standing
atop the stove as the waters rose, waving goodbye to the neighbors
and asking them to feed my cat.
</P>
<P>
   The moment of self-pity passed quickly. I grabbed the phone to
call Roger the plumber, my new best friend. Water dripped on my
head as I dialed.
</P>
<P>
   The plumbing shop lady told me Roger was on a job in a nearby
town but she'd see what she could do. I think I babbled something
about the Erie Canal. Five minutes later she called back to tell me
help was on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Elaine finished up and left for the day. I sat on the kitchen
floor staring at the ceiling and trying to visualize the maze of
pipes lurking beyond the plaster. It wasn't pretty. By the time
Roger came in I was feverishly rambling on about moving to central
Florida and building a stilt house with no indoor plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``First things first,'' Roger said as he uprooted the toilet.
``This would be the most logical spot for a leak.'' A new seal and
a couple of flushes
</P>
<P>
   later, it looked like maybe he was right. No more drip. Then we
tried the tub. Guess what?
</P>
<P>
   ``Too much bathing,'' he teased. ``Running all that dirty water
down the pipes just wore 'em out.'' I muttered an apology and
suggested maybe he should moonlight as a stand-up comedian at Hoy's
bar.
</P>
<P>
   That was a week ago. Now I have half-a-new kitchen ceiling and
all new plastic drains. Roger said he'd never seen a house with
copper ones before.
</P>
<P>
   Said he'd been expecting rusty galvanized stuff.
</P>
<P>
   This morning, Roger's next door banging on the neighbor's pipes
and Tom the carpenter, painter, and plaster man, is rolling a final
coat of ivory on my new ceiling. Life is good again.
</P>
<P>
   Thank you, Roger.
</P>
<P>
   Thank you, Tom.
</P>
<P>
   And thank you Sharon, for letting me use your shower all week.
(I hope the guys digging up your septic tank aren't blaming me for
that too.)

 &HT;    E-mail function on Cadillac might be a mixed blessing
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Are you a true member of the e-generation? Then odds
are you are one of the people that General Motors, specifically its
Cadillac division, is hoping to appeal to with the introduction of
the 2001 Web-enabled vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with the 2001 model year, all GM vehicles equipped with
OnStar will be able _ via a service called Virtual Advisor _ to
receive audibly a variety of information, including e-mail. All
2001 Cadillacs will come with OnStar as standard equipment. It will
be optional on selected other models.
</P>
<P>
   You set up a personal account to specify what information you
want. To access it, you simply push the vehicle's OnStar button.
</P>
<P>
   The list of options will include news headlines, sports scores,
stock quotes and e-mail. No more will you be stuck in those
seemingly endless traffic jams with nothing to do.
</P>
<P>
   But there is more. Through technology provided by collaboration
of Bose Audio Systems and Delphi Automotive Systems, the 2001
Cadillac Seville and DeVille models will become the first vehicles
to offer an installed PC.
</P>
<P>
   These two Cadillac models will combine the functionality of the
OnStar system with an in-car PC and a digital voice recorder.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the scenario. You are on your way to work. Barely out
the back door, you find yourself stuck in traffic. You call OnStar
and request your e-mail summary. Up pops ``Call your boss,'' so you
ask the attendant to read the entire e-mail. The boss gives a phone
number where he can be reached. You record that number on your
digital recorder. Then you activate your audio-controlled cell
phone, telling it to dial the number you have stored on the digital
recorder.
</P>
<P>
   Your boss announces that he wants you to attend a meeting in an
hour _ in the opposite direction of where you are heading. You
record that information on the digital recorder. You pull to the
side of the road and activate the car's on-board navigational
system and program in the street address. With turn-by-turn
instructions, your Cadillac gets you out of the traffic jam and
leads you to your meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty cool, huh? Or is it?
</P>
<P>
   I have mixed emotions about the concept of being multifunctional
while driving a car. Call me old-fashioned, but I think a vehicle
in motion requires all the driver's attention. That's not just
hands and eyes, but the brain as well.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, I can appreciate that in today's fast-paced
society, there are those who will welcome this opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac's general marketing manager Mike O'Malley claims
motorists spend about 500 million hours a week in their vehicles.
So Web-enhanced vehicles could result in increased productivity _
not to mention a longer workday.
</P>
<P>
   But General Motors is to be applauded for making this system as
distraction-free as possible. Gratefully, the e-mail screen is
blanked out whenever the car is in motion, allowing the driver to
receive this information audibly.
</P>
<P>
   Hand-held cell phones are enough of a distraction. Can you
imagine the road rage that could be generated by someone stopped in
the middle of rush hour reading e-mail?

 &HT;    Techno the music of car sales
 &HT;    By Chris Hutchins
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The periodic table of elements flashes
on the screen. And then comes the sound _ a whooshing noise
somewhere between a jet engine and a tornado siren.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scientists announced today the discovery of a new element,'' a
woman's voice announces. ``They're calling it Turbonium.''
</P>
<P>
   And so begins one of the latest Volkswagen ads. With an
electronic snarl, little computer-animated Beetles zip around in
atomic formation. The music picks up _ an infectious, grainy
amalgam of beats and bleeps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The addition of Turbonium to the periodic table of elements
... practical applications are still unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   The tune gets frenetic. Strange sounds _ are they pan flutes? _
swirl by. The bass keeps thumping. We're going at more than 140
beats per minute now.
</P>
<P>
   By the end, you've seen the guts of a ``Turbonium'' atom, and
you've seen the new turbo-charged Volkswagen Beetle from just about
every angle. But it's the music you remember. That's what got your
attention _ got your feet tapping and your head moving.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the point, say the folks at Volkswagen of America and
Arnold Communications, the Boston-based firm that created the
commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to create an image where people will remember us for
our music,'' says Liz Vanzura, director of marketing at Volkswagen
of America. ``When you go after the youth market, they're very
in-tune with music. They love what we do with it. It's our way to
carve a niche.''
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen isn't the only one banking on cool songs these days.
In the hyper-competitive automotive market, companies are using
music as an integral element for their commercials. Viewers have
heard everything from Van Halen (Nissan) to Ozzy Ozborne
(Mitsubishi) in car ads.
</P>
<P>
   But the music genre that's being tapped more and more is techno.
It's a kind of dance music, mixed and filtered through computer
software. That's what the Turbonium theme is. And so is the band
Orb's tune that's used in the Beetle's ``Reverse Engineered By
UFOs'' ad.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Nissan commercial features mechanical grinds created by
a musician named Rob D, which is perfectly synchronized to
on-screen robots building a Maxima.
</P>
<P>
   ``The role of music in car commercials is one of the last tools
in the marketer's arsenal,'' explains Rob Schwartz, creative
director of Nissan's ads at the firm TBWA/Chait/Day. ``It can get
under people's radar. People have grown up on commercials _ they've
seen everything. But the one thing that is disarming, the place
where you can connect, is the music. That's why it's been playing
such a prominent role.''
</P>
<P>
   And techno's prominence has been growing in advertising. Last
year, a song by the Norwegian band Biosphere was used in a Levi's
ad. In January, Pirelli tires used a Chemical Brothers tune to
accompany the adventures of a woman as she dashed through ice
plains, across lakes and over lava pits. Channel surf tonight, and
you'll probably see a Sears commercial hocking some hi-tech goods,
as an electronic beat keeps up. The new McDonald's Monopoly ads
feature electronic music, too.
</P>
<P>
   Why use this music? Ad firms are looking for tunes that fit the
mood of a commercial, says Vanzura. If you're making a gentle
commercial, you'll go for gentle music. But if you're doing a
commercial that evokes a ``technical'' emotion, an electronic,
high-paced feeling, you go techno, she says.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're attracting the youth market _ people college-age
to around 35 _ you want to go with what they know.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go by what we think goes best with the spot,'' Vanzura
says. ``We used techno for the Turbonium spot. ... We were
introducing a new engine technology; it was very
performance-oriented. So we wanted something fast.''
</P>
<P>
   They went to Ben Neill, a New York-based musician who began
experimenting in electronic music more than 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I immediately heard the sound, what it would be like to
actually be inside the atom,'' Neill says. ``That fast-spinning,
that rrrrshh. That was the motivation for that one. It came
together pretty quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   If you like techno, you love the ad. And you'll also probably
like what Neill's cooking up for VW later this year: Music for four
ads plugging VW's pre-owned cars.
</P>
<P>
   And if you don't like it? Plug your ears, because the techno
trend is going to continue, Vanzura says. ``Music is a big part of
us. It's gotten to the point where artists are calling us up, and
saying, `Please consider us for your next ad.'''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well. Techophobes can always count on the U.S. Postal
Service. It's still using Steve Miller's ``Fly Like an Eagle'' in
its commercials.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT IS TECHNO?
</P>
<P>
   It's a music genre known for its fast beat, digitally processed
sounds and danceability. Popular at clubs and rave parties, techno
has its roots in Detroit, where underground DJs developed it during
the early 1990s. The most popular techno bands include Prodigy,
Chemical Brothers and Moby.

 &HT;    A grand debut for Audi A8L

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Start enumerating the big luxury cars, and the
response is certain to include German-built sedans, but probably
none produced by Audi. But Audi justifiably hopes to change that,
among well-informed buffs at least, with the addition of the A8L.
</P>
<P>
   Although classified by the EPA as a midsize car, the A8L is a
formidable-appearing machine with a competent feel based on its
aluminum space-frame construction and ``quattro'' all-wheel-drive
system. Rear-wheel spin and front-wheel torque steer are difficult
to produce or detect despite the A8L's 310-horsepower V-8 engine.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being a top-of-the-category performer, the A8L
also ranks among the leaders in price with a base of $67,900. The
test car, with a full complement of options, totaled $72,525.
</P>
<P>
   Like the exterior, the interior is understated, with nice
touches including window screens, good drink holders and a concert
hall stereo with CD player. The A8L has the requisite
leather-and-wood touches, excellent seating and precise
fit-and-finish, but it's not a grabber. A first-time driver or
passenger may nod in satisfaction at the cabin, but isn't likely to
call it the epitome of luxury.
</P>
<P>
   The A8L drives in much the same manner, doing what's expected
with composure and _ appreciate it again _ the stability that comes
with a refined four-wheel-drive system. The steering's on the numb
side, and the A8L needs grippier, quieter tires than those on
showroom cars, but otherwise rides like a muted dream.
</P>
<P>
   Left alone, the five-speed automatic transmission is smooth up
and down through the gears, although it takes a firm foot to induce
downshifts for passing or merging with traffic. The Tiptronic
feature, allowing what's called ``manumatic'' shifting by flicking
the console-mounted shifter forward or back, may be a plus to some
drivers, a needless gimmick to others. The novelty soon wears off.
</P>
<P>
   What will endure is an appreciation of the seamless ride,
performance and ease of driving built into the A8L. Big ol' cars,
domestic or import, like the A8L prove that automakers can build
all-around satisfying vehicles with good safety features, but they
come with premium prices.
</P>
<P>
   Test vehicle: 2000 Audi A8L all-wheel-drive sedan
</P>
<P>
   Price as tested: $72,525 (base: $67,900, plus $525 delivery)
</P>
<P>
   Drivetrain: 4.2-liter V-8 (310 horsepower), five-speed automatic
transmission with semimanual Tiptronic mode
</P>
<P>
   Safety features: dual front air bags, front and rear side air
bags, head-protective curtain side air bags, height-adjustable
front shoulder belts, power anti-lock disc brakes
</P>
<P>
   Options on test vehicle: pearl white paint, $1,200; 18-inch
wheels and performance tires, $1,500; xenon headlamps, $500; ski
sack, $200; acoustic parking, $700
</P>
<P>
   EPA figures: 17 mpg premium unleaded city, 24 mpg highway

 &HT;    Baylor center wants to wedge religion into science class
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ They are the new breed of creationists. Atomic
creationists, you might say.
</P>
<P>
   And their official harboring at Baylor University has caused
many in the faculty to go nuclear.
</P>
<P>
   The launching of a center to promote ``theistic science'' or
``intelligent design'' is proving to be one of the biggest
controversies of the Robert Sloan presidency. If not the biggest
controversy, possibly it is the most emblematic.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is the Michael Polanyi Center. Created supposedly to
build a bridge between science and religion, it shares a hangar
with Baylor's Institute for Faith and Learning. Problem: Baylor
didn't consult anyone in its science departments. To much of the
faculty, this is no bridge. It's a detour.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the faculty senate, Robert Baird, calls Polanyi
``one of the most divisive issues'' in his 32 years at Baylor and
bemoans that a center focused on what it calls the ``growing
dialogue between science and religion'' was created without a word
sought from Baylor's scientists.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the concern is over process, such as the science
faculty's perceived snubbing, the overriding issue is substance _
what Polanyi is about.
</P>
<P>
   What it's about is not an alliance with science but the refuting
of it, or at least refuting the science of evolution and its
Darwinist underpinnings.
</P>
<P>
   That was clear within the first few words of a conference called
``The Nature of Nature'' hosted by Baylor and the center last week.
</P>
<P>
   University of Texas philosophy Professor Robert Koons told the
audience that with the whole of evidence examined, scientists
(evolutionists) ``have no authority to dictate to us.'' Dialogue,
anyone?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nature is comprehensible only'' if an outside force _ God _
has set in motion all the inner complexity, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Koons among others, including Polanyi director William Dembski,
adheres to the ``intelligent design'' theory _ the new creationism.
Essentially it grants to science certain facts: that the world is
billions of years old rather than a few thousand, that evolution is
a fact as it pertains to plants and animals, right up to the
doorstep of man.
</P>
<P>
   However, the essence of intelligent design is that man is in
God's image, as the Bible says.
</P>
<P>
   As Christians, Baylor science faculty members who so vehemently
denounce Polanyi may not disagree with that bottom line. They just
see the ``intelligent design'' crowd as seeking to put a tourniquet
on inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor associate psychology Professor Charles Weaver derides it
as the ``God card'' characterized by the bumper sticker meant to
annoy any scientist: ``God says it; I believe it; that settles
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever God might say, science is the process of studying that
which can be examined and tested empirically.
</P>
<P>
   In a feisty and somewhat quixotic way, the intelligent design
crowd is like a kickboxer challenging a microscope to a fight. The
microscope is not there to fight. It is there to examine.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean that the scientists won't fight. Baylor
associate biology Professor Richard Duhrkopf, a bitter critic of
Polanyi, said the center's quest is to ``change the philosophy of
science.'' More ominously, it is advocated by creationists as a
wedge to get religion into science class in public schools, as
reported recently by ``CNN Newsstand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Darwin is dead, Darwinism is getting sicker by the day,''
wrote creationist Hal Ostrander in a recent commentary in SBC Life
extolling the work of Dembski and Co. Ostrander gushes about the
potential of intelligent design to transform science class in
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Critics in the Baylor faculty see the Polanyi Center as
undermining the university's reputation in the sciences. If Baylor
thinks Polanyi is worth risking its reputation, maybe that
empirical stuff isn't what it wants to be known for.

   COXNET WHEELS 0418 -- It's little, loud and generally viewed as
being crude and underpowered, but the Korean-built Kia Sportage has
some noteworthy pluses, including a strong record in off-road
racing. The Sportage, available in two- and four-wheel drive with
two trim levels, is built to be cheap, but start adding options and
the bottom line can pass the $20,000 mark. (DeVault, Atlanta

 &HT;    E-mail function on Cadillac might be a mixed blessing
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Are you a true member of the e-generation? Then odds
are you are one of the people that General Motors, specifically its
Cadillac division, is hoping to appeal to with the introduction of
the 2001 Web-enabled vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with the 2001 model year, all GM vehicles equipped with
OnStar will be able _ via a service called Virtual Advisor _ to
receive audibly a variety of information, including e-mail. All
2001 Cadillacs will come with OnStar as standard equipment. It will
be optional on selected other models.
</P>
<P>
   You set up a personal account to specify what information you
want. To access it, you simply push the vehicle's OnStar button.
</P>
<P>
   The list of options will include news headlines, sports scores,
stock quotes and e-mail. No more will you be stuck in those
seemingly endless traffic jams with nothing to do.
</P>
<P>
   But there is more. Through technology provided by collaboration
of Bose Audio Systems and Delphi Automotive Systems, the 2001
Cadillac Seville and DeVille models will become the first vehicles
to offer an installed PC.
</P>
<P>
   These two Cadillac models will combine the functionality of the
OnStar system with an in-car PC and a digital voice recorder.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the scenario. You are on your way to work. Barely out
the back door, you find yourself stuck in traffic. You call OnStar
and request your e-mail summary. Up pops ``Call your boss,'' so you
ask the attendant to read the entire e-mail. The boss gives a phone
number where he can be reached. You record that number on your
digital recorder. Then you activate your audio-controlled cell
phone, telling it to dial the number you have stored on the digital
recorder.
</P>
<P>
   Your boss announces that he wants you to attend a meeting in an
hour _ in the opposite direction of where you are heading. You
record that information on the digital recorder. You pull to the
side of the road and activate the car's on-board navigational
system and program in the street address. With turn-by-turn
instructions, your Cadillac gets you out of the traffic jam and
leads you to your meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty cool, huh? Or is it?
</P>
<P>
   I have mixed emotions about the concept of being multifunctional
while driving a car. Call me old-fashioned, but I think a vehicle
in motion requires all the driver's attention. That's not just
hands and eyes, but the brain as well.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, I can appreciate that in today's fast-paced
society, there are those who will welcome this opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac's general marketing manager Mike O'Malley claims
motorists spend about 500 million hours a week in their vehicles.
So Web-enhanced vehicles could result in increased productivity _
not to mention a longer workday.
</P>
<P>
   But General Motors is to be applauded for making this system as
distraction-free as possible. Gratefully, the e-mail screen is
blanked out whenever the car is in motion, allowing the driver to
receive this information audibly.
</P>
<P>
   Hand-held cell phones are enough of a distraction. Can you
imagine the road rage that could be generated by someone stopped in
the middle of rush hour reading e-mail?

 &HT;    Techno the music of car sales
 &HT;    By Chris Hutchins
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The periodic table of elements flashes
on the screen. And then comes the sound _ a whooshing noise
somewhere between a jet engine and a tornado siren.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scientists announced today the discovery of a new element,'' a
woman's voice announces. ``They're calling it Turbonium.''
</P>
<P>
   And so begins one of the latest Volkswagen ads. With an
electronic snarl, little computer-animated Beetles zip around in
atomic formation. The music picks up _ an infectious, grainy
amalgam of beats and bleeps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The addition of Turbonium to the periodic table of elements
... practical applications are still unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   The tune gets frenetic. Strange sounds _ are they pan flutes? _
swirl by. The bass keeps thumping. We're going at more than 140
beats per minute now.
</P>
<P>
   By the end, you've seen the guts of a ``Turbonium'' atom, and
you've seen the new turbo-charged Volkswagen Beetle from just about
every angle. But it's the music you remember. That's what got your
attention _ got your feet tapping and your head moving.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the point, say the folks at Volkswagen of America and
Arnold Communications, the Boston-based firm that created the
commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to create an image where people will remember us for
our music,'' says Liz Vanzura, director of marketing at Volkswagen
of America. ``When you go after the youth market, they're very
in-tune with music. They love what we do with it. It's our way to
carve a niche.''
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen isn't the only one banking on cool songs these days.
In the hyper-competitive automotive market, companies are using
music as an integral element for their commercials. Viewers have
heard everything from Van Halen (Nissan) to Ozzy Ozborne
(Mitsubishi) in car ads.
</P>
<P>
   But the music genre that's being tapped more and more is techno.
It's a kind of dance music, mixed and filtered through computer
software. That's what the Turbonium theme is. And so is the band
Orb's tune that's used in the Beetle's ``Reverse Engineered By
UFOs'' ad.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Nissan commercial features mechanical grinds created by
a musician named Rob D, which is perfectly synchronized to
on-screen robots building a Maxima.
</P>
<P>
   ``The role of music in car commercials is one of the last tools
in the marketer's arsenal,'' explains Rob Schwartz, creative
director of Nissan's ads at the firm TBWA/Chait/Day. ``It can get
under people's radar. People have grown up on commercials _ they've
seen everything. But the one thing that is disarming, the place
where you can connect, is the music. That's why it's been playing
such a prominent role.''
</P>
<P>
   And techno's prominence has been growing in advertising. Last
year, a song by the Norwegian band Biosphere was used in a Levi's
ad. In January, Pirelli tires used a Chemical Brothers tune to
accompany the adventures of a woman as she dashed through ice
plains, across lakes and over lava pits. Channel surf tonight, and
you'll probably see a Sears commercial hocking some hi-tech goods,
as an electronic beat keeps up. The new McDonald's Monopoly ads
feature electronic music, too.
</P>
<P>
   Why use this music? Ad firms are looking for tunes that fit the
mood of a commercial, says Vanzura. If you're making a gentle
commercial, you'll go for gentle music. But if you're doing a
commercial that evokes a ``technical'' emotion, an electronic,
high-paced feeling, you go techno, she says.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're attracting the youth market _ people college-age
to around 35 _ you want to go with what they know.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go by what we think goes best with the spot,'' Vanzura
says. ``We used techno for the Turbonium spot. ... We were
introducing a new engine technology; it was very
performance-oriented. So we wanted something fast.''
</P>
<P>
   They went to Ben Neill, a New York-based musician who began
experimenting in electronic music more than 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I immediately heard the sound, what it would be like to
actually be inside the atom,'' Neill says. ``That fast-spinning,
that rrrrshh. That was the motivation for that one. It came
together pretty quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   If you like techno, you love the ad. And you'll also probably
like what Neill's cooking up for VW later this year: Music for four
ads plugging VW's pre-owned cars.
</P>
<P>
   And if you don't like it? Plug your ears, because the techno
trend is going to continue, Vanzura says. ``Music is a big part of
us. It's gotten to the point where artists are calling us up, and
saying, `Please consider us for your next ad.'''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well. Techophobes can always count on the U.S. Postal
Service. It's still using Steve Miller's ``Fly Like an Eagle'' in
its commercials.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT IS TECHNO?
</P>
<P>
   It's a music genre known for its fast beat, digitally processed
sounds and danceability. Popular at clubs and rave parties, techno
has its roots in Detroit, where underground DJs developed it during
the early 1990s. The most popular techno bands include Prodigy,
Chemical Brothers and Moby.

 &HT;    A grand debut for Audi A8L
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Start enumerating the big luxury cars, and the
response is certain to include German-built sedans, but probably
none produced by Audi. But Audi justifiably hopes to change that,
among well-informed buffs at least, with the addition of the A8L.
</P>
<P>
   Although classified by the EPA as a midsize car, the A8L is a
formidable-appearing machine with a competent feel based on its
aluminum space-frame construction and ``quattro'' all-wheel-drive
system. Rear-wheel spin and front-wheel torque steer are difficult
to produce or detect despite the A8L's 310-horsepower V-8 engine.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being a top-of-the-category performer, the A8L
also ranks among the leaders in price with a base of $67,900. The
test car, with a full complement of options, totaled $72,525.
</P>
<P>
   Like the exterior, the interior is understated, with nice
touches including window screens, good drink holders and a concert
hall stereo with CD player. The A8L has the requisite
leather-and-wood touches, excellent seating and precise
fit-and-finish, but it's not a grabber. A first-time driver or
passenger may nod in satisfaction at the cabin, but isn't likely to
call it the epitome of luxury.
</P>
<P>
   The A8L drives in much the same manner, doing what's expected
with composure and _ appreciate it again _ the stability that comes
with a refined four-wheel-drive system. The steering's on the numb
side, and the A8L needs grippier, quieter tires than those on
showroom cars, but otherwise rides like a muted dream.
</P>
<P>
   Left alone, the five-speed automatic transmission is smooth up
and down through the gears, although it takes a firm foot to induce
downshifts for passing or merging with traffic. The Tiptronic
feature, allowing what's called ``manumatic'' shifting by flicking
the console-mounted shifter forward or back, may be a plus to some
drivers, a needless gimmick to others. The novelty soon wears off.
</P>
<P>
   What will endure is an appreciation of the seamless ride,
performance and ease of driving built into the A8L. Big ol' cars,
domestic or import, like the A8L prove that automakers can build
all-around satisfying vehicles with good safety features, but they
come with premium prices.
</P>
<P>
   Test vehicle: 2000 Audi A8L all-wheel-drive sedan
</P>
<P>
   Price as tested: $72,525 (base: $67,900, plus $525 delivery)
</P>
<P>
   Drivetrain: 4.2-liter V-8 (310 horsepower), five-speed automatic
transmission with semimanual Tiptronic mode
</P>
<P>
   Safety features: dual front air bags, front and rear side air
bags, head-protective curtain side air bags, height-adjustable
front shoulder belts, power anti-lock disc brakes
</P>
<P>
   Options on test vehicle: pearl white paint, $1,200; 18-inch
wheels and performance tires, $1,500; xenon headlamps, $500; ski
sack, $200; acoustic parking, $700
</P>
<P>
   EPA figures: 17 mpg premium unleaded city, 24 mpg highway

   COXNET WHEELS 0418 -- It's little, loud and generally viewed as
being crude and underpowered, but the Korean-built Kia Sportage has
some noteworthy pluses, including a strong record in off-road
racing. The Sportage, available in two- and four-wheel drive with
two trim levels, is built to be cheap, but start adding options and
the bottom line can pass the $20,000 mark. (DeVault, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) Art includes 4-column color photo of the 2000
Kia Sportage and a 2-column color photo of the SUV's interior.

   SHARP DRIVING -- You can do many little things to stretch your
gas mileage. Just like a diet, don't expect to see huge immediate
results, but consider the gain over a month or six weeks. It will
add up to a tank of gas, more or less. (Sharp, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). Includes 1-column color photograph of

   TECHNOCAR _ Car commercials. They use really cool, techno music

Volkswagon is a wonderful repeat offender. (Hutchins, Palm Beach

   AVANTI _ VILLA RICA, Ga. _ Few cars have captured aficionados'
attention like the Studebaker Avanti. And few cars have shown the
Avanti's catlike ability to survive. Studebaker may be long gone as
an automaker, but the latest edition of the Avanti is taking shape
in a converted hosiery mill in Villa Rica under the guidance of
former Avanti consultant, sales representative and collector John

   COLOR-PLANTS _ Most plants need a certain amount of sunlight to
flower, and if your yard's mostly shade, you know that's an uphill
battle. To compensate, why not emphasize plants that offer colorful
leaves throughout several seasons? Garden centers are brimming with
options right now, but remember: Foliage with vibrant color can be
had with trees, shrubs, perennials or annuals _ some that bloom,
some that don't. The challenge is combining those plants so that
their foliage complements each other. Our foliage guide shows how
to mix and match plants for maximum color. (Flanders, Atlanta

 Yo, Martha Stewart: The demitasse has been thrown   
 By DARYL LEASE   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many of us, I suspect, are still a little wobbly and woozy from
last week's shocking announcement: Martha Stewart may bug out of
the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   In a piece for The New York Times, the titaness of taste and
tidiness revealed that she's fed up with life in fashionable
Westport, Conn. It seems she recently tried to give several new
neighbors fresh eggs and garden produce, only to be snubbed _
``once with a slammed door!'' So she's moving.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know about you, but I smell weakness in good old Mart,
and I couldn't be happier.
</P>
<P>
   At long last, here's my chance to ``redecorate.'' While she's
busy packing up her belongings in boxes stylishly redone in pastels
and flowery prints, I intend to stage a hostile takeover of her
newspaper column.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, I'm a guy, and a rather slobby one at that. But I'm
confident I can bring a breath of fresh, albeit garlicky, air to
the home decorating racket. (I'd know exactly what to do if someone
slammed the door on me and my housewarming gift. I mean, c'mon,
(ITAL)I'm carrying eggs.(END ITAL) Duh.)
</P>
<P>
   So here, without further ado, is my first installment of Daryl
Lease Living. I call it, ``Drinking problems: The only one I got is
finding a halfway clean cup ...''
</P>
<P>
   When my wife and I got engaged nine years ago, I manfully tried
to convince her we should ``register'' at our bank and list our
checking account number as our ``pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   She wouldn't go for it, so instead of cash, we ended up with a
lot of expensive pieces of china and silver that _ from Day 1 _ I
have not been allowed to handle unsupervised. I can't even go near
the plates, lest I do something foolish like, say, eat a sandwich
off them.
</P>
<P>
   I accept this as a fact of married life. It's OK. Truth be told,
we hubbies can't quite make out what most of these things are for
anyway. A sorbet spoon? (ITAL)Please.(END ITAL) If you're going to
serve us fancy ice cream, have the decency to give us utensils of
appropriate size so that we can eat the stuff before it melts.
</P>
<P>
   I can live with the fact that most of our kitchen is devoted to
items we use only on very, very special occasions _ occasions that,
not coincidentally, are guy-free.
</P>
<P>
   I really had to object, though, when my lovely bride tried to
push this china-and-silver frippery too far and ruthlessly demanded
that I not bring into our marriage a very, very special _ nay,
sacred _ form of kitchenware from my bachelor days.
</P>
<P>
   I'm speaking, of course, of plastic stadium cups. Lots of guys
have them. All women hate them.
</P>
<P>
   Like snowflakes and fingerprints, no two plastic cups are alike.
They may emerge from factories the same, all sparkly and
dishwasher-safe, but they quickly assume their own distinct
personalities _ faded, scuffed and usually a little warped.
</P>
<P>
   Some plastic cups are simple works of art, brightly colored but
unadorned. Others are decorative, often recalling a special event.
A college keg party. A ballgame. A night at a classy restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   These unassuming plastic cups are, of course, as much a part of
a guy's life as a well-worn, comfortable T-shirt, or a well-worn,
comfortable pair of jeans, or a well-worn, comfortable pair of
shoes. What's more, they're darned useful.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fairer gender's reputation for common sense and
practicality, it's been my observation that they often fail to see
the beauty in utilitarian objects. They favor form over function,
image over substance, polish over spit.
</P>
<P>
   They prefer pretty but unusable china over perfectly good,
discount-store plates. They toss out our fine, serviceable plastic
cups in favor of fragile stemware that holds no more liquid than a
demitasse. (At least I think that frou-frou, thimble-sized cup is a
demitasse. I can't get close enough to identify it with accuracy.)
</P>
<P>
   Through a bit of diplomacy on my part, my wife and I have
reached a compromise. I am allowed to stash a specific number of
plastic cups _ four _ in a remote kitchen cabinet. I can bring them
out only for use by guys. (I refused her demands to do so only with
the shades drawn.)
</P>
<P>
   So far, the system has worked well, but I would caution all men
to remember the old nuclear arsenal adage: Trust but verify. Count
the cups before they go in the dishwasher, and count them as they
emerge. It's the only way to keep the peace.
</P>
<P>
   (ITAL)Next week's Living:(END ITAL) ``The toilet seat: What's
the deal? Why can't they put it up when they're done?''

   PAUL-REVERE (Danville, Calif.) _ April 18 is the anniversary of
a historical moment remembered primarily because of its rendering

American Revolution. The artist is poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.
The art is Longfellow's famous poem, ``Paul Revere's Ride,''
written 85 years after the event. The discrepancies between
Revere's real ride and his ride in the poem are many; they force us
to question how seriously (if at all) we should trust artists to
tell the truth. By CYNTHIA BASS.

THOSE REVEALING CENSUS QUESTIONS
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have just received preliminary results of 2000 census and I
must admit that I find some of the statistics rather startling.
</P>
<P>
   According to the new census, only 11,486 people now live in
Florida, compared to 13 million in 1990. This huge population drop
comes as a pleasant surprise because I was under the impression
that Florida was growing more crowded by the second to the point
that the combined weight of its inhabitants was causing it to sink
into the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Since the census is conducted by the U.S. government, I know it
must be infallible, but I still have trouble believing 11,988,514
people moved out of Florida in the past 10 years without anyone
noticing. Perhaps this is just another example of how the Monica
Lewinsky scandal riveted our attention to the point that we were
unaware of any other news.
</P>
<P>
   Another interesting statistic that I have combed from the new
census is that 75 percent of U.S. families list their annual income
as ``none of your $%&AMP;(AT)(NU) business.'' This is a substantial
increase, or possibly decrease, from the 1998 median family income
of $44,568. It will take a better economist than I to determine if
``none of your $%&AMP;(AT)(NU) business'' reveals a robust economy or
one where citizens will soon be reduced to filling the tanks of
their SUVs with eyedroppers.
</P>
<P>
   The average age of U.S. citizens has also undergone a dramatic
transformation, according to the preliminary figures I have been
provided. In 1998, the median age of Americans was 35 years; in the
year 2000, the median age is ``sit on it.'' What exactly this will
mean to Florida, which has a large (256) population of people 65
and older, is unclear. Federal funding for programs for the aged
will probably depend on whether a Washington bureaucrat interprets
``sit on it'' to mean that our senior citizens are more in need of
federal handouts or less.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, 16 percent of Florida residents were foreign-born. This
year, the number of Florida residents who are foreign-born is
``so's your mother.'' I am not conversant in foreign languages so I
cannot say if ``so's your mother'' is of Spanish, French or German
derivation, but I think it's clear that our state is enjoying, or
suffering through, a period of unprecedented, or perhaps utterly
predictable, cultural diversity the likes of which this great
nation has never, or has often before, seen.
</P>
<P>
   There was some concern early on that citizens would refuse to
fill out their census forms, or would provide inaccurate
information, out of fear that the information would be leaked to or
pirated by unscrupulous parties other than the federal government.
Happily, this did not happen. According to the Census Bureau, 85
percent of Florida's 11,486 residents returned their forms and not
only completed every line but also often included extra,
unrequested information, such as suggestions as to where the Census
Bureau could get off and how cold a day in hell it would be before
they would reveal their child-care arrangements or how many days
they had been unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   It's nice to know that the American people still trust their
government to the point that they will gladly and voluntarily share
with it intimate details of their personal lives that they would
not feel comfortable talking about with other family members or
best friends.
</P>
<P>
   If the government says it needs this information, than it must
be so, because the government has never lied to us in the past, or
at least admitted to it.
</P>
<P>
   And besides, if it weren't for the census, how would we know
that the number of American adults who have been divorced jumped,
or plummeted, from 10 percent in 1997 to ``bite me'' in 2000?

&HT;     AUTOMOTIVE `HYBRIDS' COULD BE THE NEXT BIG THING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ For many rugged types, this just might be the best
of two worlds: the marriage of a pickup and a sport-utility
vehicle. Automakers call it a hybrid, designed to bring consumers
the two types of vehicles that are the hottest among U.S.
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. earlier announced plans
for their own versions of the hybrid pickup-SUV. But Ford's 2001
Explorer Sport Trac is the first to market _ it went on sale in
late January.
</P>
<P>
   Early next year, Chevrolet will introduce the 2002 Avalanche, a
cross between the full-size Tahoe SUV and Silverado pickup, and the
S-10 Baja, a mixture of the compact S-10 pickup and Blazer
sport-utility, GM spokesman Roger Gray said from the company's
Dallas office.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche has been described as a Swiss Army knife with a
V-8 engine. It comes with a 5-foot-3-inch bed that can be extended
to 8 feet by removing the ``midgate,'' which separates the back
seat from the cargo area, Gray said. It's based on the platform of
the full-size GM pickups.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's Lincoln division plans to introduce the Blackwood, a
blend of the full-size Lincoln Navigator luxury sport-utility and a
pickup. A variant of the Blackwood was shown at the 1999 North
American International Auto Show in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   That was when Ford also showed the first Sport Trac, which now
has begun flowing from the factory in Louisville, Ky., to U.S. Ford
dealerships.
</P>
<P>
   The Sport Trac _ a four-door Explorer midsize sport-utility from
the nose to the back of the rear seat, and a pickup from there to
the rear bumper _ carries a price that falls between the two-door
Explorer Sport and the four-door Explorer SUVs.
</P>
<P>
   Even for those who don't particularly need the truck
capabilities of the Sport Trac, with its 4-by-4-foot pickup bed,
the Sport Trac comes off as a bargain-priced Explorer, with an
exposed cargo area.
</P>
<P>
   For about $25,000, a consumer can purchase a fully equipped
Sport Trac, with a passenger compartment identical to that of a
regular Explorer and the same V-6 engine. To get an Explorer this
well equipped would cost several thousand dollars more, easily more
than $30,000. Sport Trac prices range from about $23,000 to
$27,000, and most dealers are selling them at sticker, without
extra markup.
</P>
<P>
   Such bargain prices _ when compared with the average midsize
sport-utility _ make the Sport Trac an attractive option for SUV
buyers on a budget, Ford dealers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you buy the hard cargo-area cover, you can turn the bed
into what essentially is a large trunk, and whatever you are
hauling is protected,'' Ford spokeswoman Marcey Evans said from
company headquarters in Dearborn, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this combination of truck and SUV will appeal to a large
number of consumers remains to be seen, but the early signs are
promising. Ford already has orders for more than 40,000 for the
2001 model year, but it had planned to build only 50,000 for the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Because demand is already outstripping supply, dealers are
taking orders and putting customers on waiting lists, and Ford has
delayed its national TV advertising for the Sport Trac until at
least mid-May, Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't like to do a lot of advertising if we don't have
enough dealer stock,'' Evans said. ``Dealers get upset, customers
get upset. We try in all of our new-vehicle launches to make sure
the advertising hits with a volume of the product being out there
for people to buy. We don't feel there is enough product out there
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Sport Trac buyers say they like the luxury of a nice
sport-utility like the Explorer, but they also need the utility of
a pickup bed to haul dirty cargo around.
</P>
<P>
   The Sport Trac has a wheelbase that is 14.25 inches longer than
the four-door Explorer's. Its pickup box is made of composite
plastic, which is 20 percent lighter than steel and also resists
dents better than steel.
</P>
<P>
   Ford says the Sport Trac appeals to younger buyers more than the
four-door Explorer. Buyers mostly will be in the mid-30s with an
active lifestyle, the company said. They are expected to use the
truck bed to haul such sports items as personal watercraft,
mountain bikes, motorcycles, snowmobiles and all-terrain vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   (STORY COULD END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
   Combining two vehicle concepts into one isn't a new idea. Ford
did it with the Ranchero and Chevy with the El Camino in the '70s _
vehicles that were cars up front and pickups at the rear. Today,
though, the sport-utility/pickup combination seems more relevant.
</P>
<P>
   But Chevrolet got rave reviews at the 2000 North American
International Auto Show in Detroit in January with the SSR concept
vehicle, a futuristic car-truck combo strongly reminiscent of the
El Camino. There is no word yet as to whether this vehicle will
ever see production. But judging from the positive reaction from
nearly 5,000 automotive journalists in the audience when the car
was unveiled, it could be a success.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the sport-utility/truck combos will continue to
hit the market as the automakers try to make the most of the
current consumer craze for SUVs and pickups.
</P>
<P>
   If demand for the Sport Trac continues to exceed supply, Ford
has the capability to shift production at the Louisville plant to
build more Sport Tracs and fewer Explorers, Evans said.

&HT;     ISUZU TROOPER POISED FOR A COMEBACK 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _Once upon a time, before sport-utility vehicles
became the rage and appeared in almost everyone's driveway, a
Japanese company called Isuzu introduced a four-door SUV that took
the market by storm.
</P>
<P>
   For five years, the Isuzu Trooper was the No. 1-selling import
sport-utility in North America _ until 1990, when Ford introduced
the Explorer, Jeep rolled out the Grand Cherokee and both Nissan
and Toyota began producing their four-door sport-utilities.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier Trooper model was quite affordable, with a price on
par with midsize sedans of the day.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1992, Isuzu took the Trooper upscale, completely
redesigning it to compete against the new, more-expensive crop of
four-door SUVs that were selling in the high $20,000s to
mid-$30,000s.
</P>
<P>
   To replace the Trooper in the affordable segment, Isuzu
introduced the smaller Rodeo, with prices ranging from the upper
teens to the mid-$20,000s.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Isuzu, the redesigned Trooper, with its higher
price tag, never caught on as well with consumers as the earlier
model did. That's unfortunate for consumers, too, because the
current-generation Trooper is among the best SUVs on the market.
</P>
<P>
   So why have consumers been slow to embrace it?
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the higher price tag and the availability of a whole
new batch of SUVs with more-familiar automakers' names on them were
to blame. But Isuzu hasn't done much to advertise and otherwise
promote the Trooper, either, so some of the blame also has to go to
the company.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 and 1997, Trooper sales suffered because of a bad rap
the vehicle got from a flawed but dramatic rollover test conducted
by Consumers Union, which was played up in Consumer Reports and ran
on almost every TV news program.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, in a federal lawsuit brought against Consumers Union
by Isuzu, a jury ruled that eight of the 17 statements in the
Consumer Reports article questioned by Isuzu Motors were false.
</P>
<P>
   The jury also found that the magazine showed a ``reckless
disregard'' for the truth when it published this statement:
``Careful driving, however, is ultimately not the answer to the
problem. Isuzu ... should never have allowed these vehicles on the
road.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury did not, however, assess any monetary damages against
Consumers Union.
</P>
<P>
   Trooper sales have recovered from the drop that Isuzu
experienced after the Consumer Reports article, but they still
aren't where they should be, considering that this is, in my
opinion, the best SUV buy on the market in the mid- to full-size
class.
</P>
<P>
   Even Consumer Reports has changed its tune about the Trooper,
and has since given it favorable ratings, especially in reliability
and dependability. The Trooper consistently rates way above average
for reliability, while some other better-selling SUVs rank way
below average.
</P>
<P>
   I heartily recommend that you test-drive a new Trooper if you're
in the market for an SUV. And if price is a concern, you might be
pleased to know that for 2000, Isuzu has introduced the first-ever
two-wheel-drive version of the Trooper, which lowers the price a
bit for people who don't need four-wheel drive.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I'd still prefer four-wheel drive, and I can tell
you from experience driving Troopers on some of North America's
most rugged trails that this is one of the most capable off-road
vehicles ever built.
</P>
<P>
   But for those of you who aren't planning off-road expeditions,
and who just want a solid, comfortable, dependable and well-built
sport-utility vehicle for home and family use, the two-wheel-drive
Trooper is an excellent choice.
</P>
<P>
   (STORY COULD END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
   There are three trim levels of the two-wheel-drive Trooper: the
base ``S'' model, the midlevel ``LS'' and the top-of-the-line
Limited.
</P>
<P>
   For this review, I tested the LS with a base price $28,650 plus
$495 transportation. There is so much standard equipment on the LS
that it's not really necessary to add anything to it to have a
truly premium SUV comparable to, say, a $38,000-plus Land Rover
Discovery, Mitsubishi Montero or Mercedes-Benz M-class.
</P>
<P>
   All Troopers come with a 215-horsepower, 3.5-liter,
double-overhead-cam, 24-valve, aluminum V-6 engine that offers more
power than many of the Trooper's competitors. It is connected to a
heavy-duty, smooth-shifting four-speed automatic transmission. A
manual transmission is offered only on the four-wheel-drive S
model.
</P>
<P>
   Standard equipment includes automatic, air-conditioning, dual
power outside mirrors (with a power fold-in feature that tucks them
out of the way for tight spots), power windows and door locks with
remote keyless entry, 16-inch aluminum wheels, eight-way power
driver's seat and four-way power passenger's seat and an in-dash
compact-disc player.
</P>
<P>
   It also includes four-wheel antilock brakes, cornering lamps,
cruise control, heated front seats, variable-assist power steering,
limited-slip differential, stainless-steel exhaust, 5,000-pound
towing capacity, tilt steering wheel, beige velour upholstery, and
full-size outside-mounted spare tire in a painted hard cover.
</P>
<P>
   The exterior paint job on the Trooper is a nine-step process
that is comparable to what you would find on a luxury car.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the Trooper comfortably seats five adults, and there
still is room for 46 cubic feet of cargo (also among the most in
class). The split-folding rear seat allows for expansion of the
cargo area while maintaining some rear seating.
</P>
<P>
   I've always liked the Trooper's rear cargo-door arrangement.
There are two doors, in a 70-30 split. The larger door opens first,
creating an opening sufficient for most loading and unloading of
cargo. But the smaller door opens, too, allowing for loading of
bulky items.
</P>
<P>
   Our test vehicle came with just three options: a power moon roof
($1,100), a trailer hitch ($253) and a cargo mat ($92). Total
sticker was $30,950, including transportation, a bargain in the
premium SUV segment.
</P>
<P>
   The warranty is among the best in the industry, too. Besides the
three-year/50,000-mile basic coverage, the Trooper comes with a
10-year/120,000-mile limited powertrain warranty and a
six-year/100,000-mile anti-corrosion warranty.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy ratings are about typical for a sport-utility
of this size: 15 miles per gallon in the city and 19 mpg on the
highway.

   Around the time Harvard astronomy professor Robert Kirshner was
boasting that the Magellan, the 21-foot telescope that Harvard and
MIT are jointly building in Chile, will be the most powerful
university telescope in the Southern Hemisphere, a disturbing
report began floating around: The California Institute of
Technology is thinking of building one 25 times more powerful.
</P>
<P>
   Caltech has reason to be concerned: It holds the record for the
world's largest optical telescope, and Harvard and MIT are trying
to build a better one in their Chilean venture.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, schools in Texas and Switzerland have made similar
plans to build bigger telescopes, setting off a veritable arms race
in the academic world.
</P>
<P>
   In the field of astronomy, it can be hard to impress. This is
the field, of course, that proved galaxies lie beyond the Milky
Way. These days, at major universities at least, it's not the
ability to stalk the cosmos that brings admiration and envy from
colleagues, it's the size and power of your telescope.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one really wants to be left behind, especially not
Harvard,'' said Kirshner. ``Part of it is the adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past five years, these giant versions of the basic
reflecting telescope made famous by Isaac Newton have popped up in
places far from the classroom _ on mountain peaks in The Andes, on
the top of volcanoes in Hawaii, and in the Arizona deserts.
Engineers in schools all over the world are fighting to be the king
of the mountains, introducing blueprints of telescopes so big they
have been dubbed ``GODS'' _ for Giant Optical Devices.
</P>
<P>
   And just to ensure that everyone knows how large these
instruments are, the scientists have given them nicknames like
``Very Large Telescope'' (belonging to German institutions) and
``Extra Large Telescope'' (the name of a planned telescope at a
Swedish university).
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the appeal of the behemoths is that the magnanamous
mirrors will gather more light and allow astronomers to see fainter
objects. But, some say, the reality is that none of the astronomy
schools want to be caught with the smallest toy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't say there isn't an element of bragging rights,''
acknowledged Stephen Maran, spokesman for the American Astronomical
Society.
</P>
<P>
   In the most competitive schools, said Maran, the telescopes are
needed to lure and keep the best scientists. They are also a good
way for colleges to look, at least to alumni with deep pockets, as
though they are staying on the cutting edge of technology, Maran
added.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1948, when Caltech began to run the 200-inch Hale
telescope _ for decades the world's greatest _ at Palomar, Calif.,
it seemed that most colleges were too busy studying astronomy
rather than optical exploration. By the early 1990s, when colleges
realized they were being left behind, Caltech and the University of
California were completing ``The Keck,'' which remains the largest
telescope in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Keck became a tool for Caltech to steal young stars from the
best science departments. Five years after Caltech lured Charles
Steidel, a promising scientist from MIT, many folks on the banks of
the Charles River are still fuming.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really hurt us,'' said Paul Schechter, a professor of
physics at MIT. ``We learned that to keep the best faculty we
better have the best resources necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard University believed it could lure Steidel back to
Cambridge by its mere reputation. But it didn't work. The last time
Harvard's telescope, a 16-incher, was the greatest in the world was
in 1840.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been working hard for a very long time to get with the
program and to catch up,'' said Kirshner, who, along with
Schechtner, was a graduate student at Caltech in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard and MIT had access to large national telescopes, but
that lost its allure since Caltech and the University of California
had exclusive rights to their own big telescope.
</P>
<P>
   Both universities needed a plan and soon: In the mid-1990s,
Kirshner and Schechter began to brainstorm with two graduate school
buddies.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Harvard and MIT had joined the University of Arizona,
University of Michigan, and the Carnegie Institution in Washington,
D.C., in building the two 6 1/2-meter telescopes called Magellan.
Others schools were collaborating: The University of Texas joined
Penn State and two German institutions to build The Hobby-Ebberly
Telescopes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, scientists are racing again to be the first to build the
next super telescope.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to worry about what other people are doing,'' said
Steidel, who said Caltech is exploring the possibility of building
a 30-meter telescope. ``But I believe competition leads to more
inventive science.''
</P>
<P>
   While Lund University in Sweden announced the possibility of
building a 50-meter telescope, The European Southern Observatory
had a bigger plan. It wants to build the mother of all telescopes _
a 100-meter instrument simply called ``The Overwhelmingly Large
Telescope.''

UPGRADING THE SHUTTLE WITH 21ST CENTURY TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOUGLAS BAILEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When astronauts Jim Halsell and Scott Horowitz crawl into the
cockpit of the Shuttle Atlantis next Monday for their scheduled
nine-day space mission, they'll be confronted with the first major
technological face-lift of the spacecraft's flight instruments
since they were first designed in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The changes won't be hard to miss. The original Shuttle's three
monochrome cathode ray tubes, along with more than 30 mechanical
gauges and dials, have been replaced with nine flat-panel color
computer screens, giving the Shuttle a real 21st-century look _
more like the slick new Boeing 777's cockpit than the dull
government-issue display of the original models.
</P>
<P>
   For NASA and the astronauts, this conversion is the homeowner's
equivalent of finally tossing out the little black-and-white TV
with rabbit ears and investing in a widescreen Dolby surround sound
home theater system.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more to it than aesthetics and modernization. NASA
says the new ``glass cockpit'' _ officially called MEDS, for
multifunction electronic display system _ weighs less, uses less
electrical power and significantly reduces pilot workload during
launch and landing, the Shuttle's most dangerous moments. The $209
million MEDS system is the first of a major overhaul that will
radically upgrade the Shuttle by 2005 and, NASA says, greatly
improve the safety and reliability of the craft as it prepares to
make frequent visits to the International Space Station.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is '90s technology,'' said Elric McHenry, manager of the
Space Shuttle's program development. ``We're moving toward where
the airline industry is going.''
</P>
<P>
   The objectives behind the upgrade are twofold, McHenry said. The
old Shuttle equipment was facing obsolescense and becoming
increasingly more difficult to maintain. The second objective was
to give pilots access to more information _ in color-coded and
graphical form _ so they can make split decisions when faced with
emergencies. And time is critical. Within eight minutes after
liftoff, the Shuttle is traveling at 18,000 miles per hour and, if
a problem crops up, the pilots have to decide quickly if it's worth
risking a planned abort. This could call for the craft to separate
from its rocket boosters and fly backward and inverted through its
own exhaust plume in order to attempt an unpowered glide back to a
landing at the Kennedy Space Center. It's never been attempted, and
no one wants to be the first to try it.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttle astronaut Steven Lindsey, who is in charge of the
cockpit upgrade, noted that the Shuttle's crew spends nearly all
its training practicing for emergency aborts during the hazardous
liftoff phase. In the old cockpit, a pilot might have to scroll
through three or more screens of data to diagnose the problem
before deciding on a course of action.
</P>
<P>
   `` &UR; Today &LR;  we have to time-share information on the three
screens,'' Lindsey said. ``During a normal ascent, we put
trajectory information on those screens, but, if there's a problem,
we have to drop that information on one screen and start looking
for the problem. The new monitors will give us all the information
at a glance without having to drop a display.''
</P>
<P>
   And, where the pilots would have to interpret data from
mechanical gauges in the old cockpit, the MEDS display will color
code all the data, showing normally running systems in green and
potential problems in red, greatly reducing the time a pilot has to
evaluate the information.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey said the technological improvements are similar to those
already embraced by the nuclear power and commercial airline
industries, which reduce the stress of information overload for
their operators and pilots.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a failure, you don't want that one failure to take
your attention away from your primary job,'' Lindsey said.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the Shuttle will be upgraded with a ``smart
cockpit'' that will not only diagnose problems but recommend
courses of action, another step that will significantly cut pilot
workload.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can cut your workload and enhance situational
awareness, your safety margins go way up,'' Lindsey said.
</P>
<P>
   Other, less-obvious upgrades to the Shuttle include improving
the optical sensors in the main engines to detect problems
milliseconds before they occur, new hydraulic power systems that
don't depend on toxic hydrazine fuel for operation, and
improvements in the solid rockets and external fuel tanks to make
them stronger and more reliable.
</P>
<P>
   All of the changes, NASA estimates, will greatly reduce the
chances of an abort during liftoff that might result in a loss of
the crew.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing the new systems won't do, Lindsey insisted, is fly
the shuttle. They still need pilots for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only time we can't physically fly the Shuttle is during
the first 80 seconds of the mission,'' he said. ``And after that,
we're really monitoring systems during ascent. But that's the way
it's designed and there's not a lot of difference between
monitoring and flying, because you've got to be ready to take it
over and fly at any point.''

VENICE'S JEWISH GHETTO IS THE WORLD'S OLDEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM A. DAVIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VENICE, Italy _ At first glance it could be any ``campo,'' the
kind of small square usually found beside a church in a Venetian
residential neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   A group of men sit at a cafe table, arguing amiably. A boombox
beside an open window sends the words of a haunting song echoing
across the square. Two small boys kick a soccer ball to and fro,
occasionally bouncing it inadvertently off a nearby wall. But we're
in Campo del Ghetto, heart of the four-centuries-old Jewish quarter
that gave its name to any section of a city in which Jews, or other
minorities, have been compelled to live because of legal or social
discrimination. (``Ghetto'' means ``foundry'' in Venetian dialect,
and there was once a cannon foundry here.)
</P>
<P>
   The houses of worship around this campo are synagogues. The men
in the cafe are wearing yarmulkes, and the point being argued
probably a Talmudic one. The lyrics of the song are in Hebrew. And
the wall the boys' ball ricochets off bears a plaque listing the
names of the more than 200 ghetto residents who died in Nazi
concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   Despite persecution, deportation, emigration, and assimilation,
a visible Jewish presence remains in this, the oldest so-called
ghetto in the world. There are five synagogues or ``scoles'' that
are among the oldest in Europe, a kosher restaurant, and a bakery
that makes unleavened bread. Also, you'll find a Jewish museum with
a collection of books, tapestries, silverware, and various
religious artifacts. The museum also operates a bookstore and
offers guided tours of the ghetto, including visits to several
synagogues.
</P>
<P>
   However, Jews are now a distinct minority in the neighborhood
they inhabited exclusively for centuries. The ghetto was created in
1516, when hundreds of Jews fleeing a war on the mainland sought
haven in Venice, which was protected by its lagoon and navy and was
one the few cities in Western Europe at the time that allowed large
numbers of Jews to reside permanently.
</P>
<P>
   But conditions of residence were harsh. Jews were not allowed to
own property outside the ghetto and could not practice most
professions and many trades. And they were obliged to wear
identifying yellow badges or distinctive caps wherever they went.
</P>
<P>
   Jews were also forbidden to leave the ghetto after dark. (An
exception was made for Jewish doctors, who could visit patients
anywhere in the city at night.) The gates of the ghetto were closed
and locked at sundown and guarded by Christian watchmen, whose
salaries had to be paid by the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Athough the original ghetto was expanded in the mid-17th
century, the quarter remained incredibly overcrowded. By 1797, when
Napoleon occupied Venice and abolished the ghetto, an estimated
5,000 people were living in just over two square blocks.
</P>
<P>
   To fit so many people into such a small area, tenement houses in
the ghetto were higher than most in Venice and had very low
ceilings (typically below 6 feet) to allow as many stories as
possible, usually six or seven. Claustrophobia was yet another
burden that went with living in the ghetto.
</P>
<P>
   Although they shared a common religious tradition and were
subject to the same legal disabilities, the ghetto dwellers were
surprisingly diverse. There were Italian Jews, of course, but also
separate groups from Germany, the south of France, the Levant
(Lebanon and Syria), and Spain. Each nationality had its own
synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish museum's guided ghetto tour begins with a visit to
the Italian synagogue, located in one of the tall tenements facing
the campo. According to the guide _ a young woman who gives her
tour in English for an international group that includes Americans,
French, Germans, and Israelis _ the Italians were the poorest of
the ghetto communities.
</P>
<P>
   By tradition there could be nothing between the roof of a
synagogue and the sky; but the impoverished Italians couldn't
afford a freestanding building. So their synagogue occupied the
entire top floor of a tenement, and was reached by six flights of
steep and narrow stairs. Visitors frequently arrive out of breath,
but so probably did many worshipers.
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1575, the Italan synagogue is no longer used for
worship but is preserved as a museum. Architecture was one of the
professions Jews were forbidden to practice, and the Italian
synagogue, like others in the ghetto, was designed by a Christian
architect who specialized in churches.
</P>
<P>
   So, as in Italian churches of the period, there is a great deal
of painted stucco and much gilded wood. The sanctuary also includes
a high and ornate pulpit of the sort Catholic priests mounted to
give their sermons at Mass on Sundays. Distinctively Jewish
features include a screened balcony for the women, who, according
to custom, worshiped separately from men.
</P>
<P>
   There are also secret panels and hidden storage areas next to
the ark where the Torah and other synagogue valuables could be
quickly concealed. The Doge of Venice once courageously defied a
command from the pope to burn Jews as heretics; but he did comply
with an order to burn Jewish religious books.
</P>
<P>
   The German congregation was the most prosperous in the ghetto,
and its Scola Tedesca, built in 1529 and also on the campo, was one
of the most elaborate. The second oldest in Europe after Prague,
the German synagogue is being completely restored and is currently
closed.
</P>
<P>
   Two synagogues are still active, the Levantine (built in 1538)
and the Spanish (late 16th century). The Spanish synagogue is noted
for its gilded Baroque-style wooden columns and also its unusual
frescoes representing Bible stories, such as Moses parting the Red
Sea. To avoid violating the commandment about making graven images,
the artist depicted only the parting sea and Moses' staff _ leaving
out the prophet and the Children of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The influence of church architecture is very noticeable in the
Levantine synagogue, which has a sanctuary area that resembles a
Christian chapel. This was definitely a male-dominated
congregation. Women sat on benches in a cramped loft, but men had a
spacious ground-floor area with seats and what look like
old-fashioned hinge-topped school desks where they could store
prayer books.
</P>
<P>
   The ghetto today is served by only one rabbi, and Sabbath
services alternate between the Spanish and Levantine synagogues.
According to the museum guide, both are also still used for
weddings and other special occasions.
</P>
<P>
   There are around 600 Jews in the city, she said, but only about
30 _ a half-dozen families _ actually live within the confines of
the old ghetto. Most of Venice's Jews are Orthodox and of Sephardic
origin, descendants of Jews expelled from Spain and Portugal in the
15th century.
</P>
<P>
   Although few Jews actually live in it now, the ghetto remains
the focal point of Venice's scattered Jewish community. The
Lubavitcher movement has a study center on the campo, and there are
several small gift shops in the area selling Jewish religious
goods.
</P>
<P>
   On the edge of the old ghetto, beside the Cannaregio Canal, is
Gam Gam, the neighborhood's only kosher restaurant. Here, diners
are served by waiters wearing yarmulkes, and the menu includes
local specialties such as ``eggplant ghetto style.'' (You can also
get potato latkes and falafel.)
</P>
<P>
   Although off the main tourist trails, the ghetto is a worthwhile
place to explore, and in recent years has begun to attract artists
and antiques dealers. But wandering its narrow streets you can come
across poignant reminders of the painful past. The marks left by
the hinges of the ghetto gates, for instance, can still be seen _
200 years after Napoleon's soldiers ripped them down in the name of
reason and the French Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Most moving and painful of all, however, is the memorial on the
north side of the campo. Here a series of seven powerfully executed
bas reliefs depicts the arrest, deportation, and death in
concentration camps of the Jews of the ghetto.
</P>
<P>
   At the outbreak of World War II, some 1,500 Jews still lived in
the former ghetto. Most went into hiding and survived, often with
the help of Italian friends. But near the end of the war the
Germans rounded up the remaining ghetto residents, many elderly and
a number bedridden or in nursing homes. Of the 289 Jews deported
from the ghetto, only two returned.
</P>
<P>
   On the memorial wall is a poem _ inscribed in Hebrew, Italian,
and English _ that reads:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Your sad holocaust is engraved in history
</P>
<P>
   And nothing shall purge your deaths from our memories
</P>
<P>
   For our memories are your only grave.

VICTORIAN BOSTON ADDS CHARACTER IN MYSTERY SERIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KENNEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Twenty-plus years ago, author Nancy Zaroulis had an
idea for a mystery series set in Victorian Boston, an era, she
says, when ``everything was so hidden, so repressed'' and ``there
was so much going on beneath the surface.'' She recalls telling
herself back then that ``writing a mystery looked to be too hard,''
so she put the idea aside and started writing what would be the
first of several novels.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' she says, ``the idea stayed with me. It haunted me and
finally, I had to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, writing under the pen name Cynthia Peale, Zaroulis has
written ``The Death of Colonel Mann; A Beacon Hill Mystery,'' the
first in an expected series to be published by Doubleday.
</P>
<P>
   What Zaroulis finds particularly fine, in a mystery-setting
sense, about the Victorian period in Boston is an atmosphere that
one of her characters describes as ``well _ proper. And often
stuffy. And cold and unforgiving.''
</P>
<P>
   That atmosphere produces the plot for ``The Death of Colonel
Mann.'' The colonel, based on a real figure, a New Yorker, not a
Bostonian, is the publisher of Town Topics, a scandal sheet. He is
happy to offer blackmail as an alternative for proper Bostonians
caught in improper relationships. For that, he is murdered.
</P>
<P>
   The sleuths are Addington Ames and his sister Caroline, who are
living in what would be called ``straitened circumstances'' in the
family house on Louisburg Square.
</P>
<P>
   Was Mann's killer a member of their own circle whose
indiscretions he had threatened to expose? Their search takes them
to the bastions of Brahmin society: the St. Botolph Club, a
debutante cotillion, Christmas Revels, and a meeting of one of the
most proper of its institutions, a sewing circle. For atmospherics,
says Zaroulis, ``there are foggy streets and gaslights.''
</P>
<P>
   For an outside observer of Boston's Brahmin culture, Zaroulis
has created Dr. John Alexander MacKenzie, a friend of the Ames
siblings who is recovering from bullet wounds received while
serving with the Army against the Sioux.
</P>
<P>
   MacKenzie ``watched his footing carefully, aided by his cane,''
Zaroulis writes. ``He wore a stout overcoat, a bowler, and a worn
muffler that he'd had for years. He'd been a little embarrassed
about that muffler at first, until he'd seen that the Ameses,
Boston Brahmins though they were, sported articles of clothing that
were even older and shabbier than it.''
</P>
<P>
   Zaroulis launches her career as a mystery writer confident that
people enjoy series. ``They get attached to the characters,'' she
says, ``and want to follow them along.''
</P>
<P>
   Readers will have that opportunity next spring with ``Murder at
Bertram's Bower,'' in which the Ameses solve a murder at a shelter
for ``fallen women'' _ prostitutes _ modeled on a real place that
was located on Washington Street in the South End. After that
there's a third, now being written, and even a fourth. ``I know
what that'll be about,'' Zaroulis says, ``but I haven't researched
it yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting to this point comes only after a long detour through
three novels and ``Who Spoke Up?'' an account of antiwar protests
written with her husband, former UMass/Boston professor Gerald
Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   Her first novel, published in 1973, was ``The Poe Papers,''
based on an episode in the life of Edgar Allan Poe. Then came
``Call the Darkness Light,'' a saga of women in the Lawrence and
Lowell textile mills (acquired for Doubleday by the late Jacqueline
Kennedy Onassis) and finally ``Massachusetts,'' a James
Micheneresque historical novel.
</P>
<P>
   Zaroulis, who allows only that she is in her 50s, grew up in
Chelmsford and went to Suffolk University. As a student and later
an editorial assistant for several Boston publishing houses, she
lived on Beacon Hill, ``when you could still rent a place for $25 a
month,'' she recalls. No wonder, then, that she chose the
neighborhood as the setting for ``The Death of Colonel Mann.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Boston pretty well,'' Zaroulis says. ``But sometimes,
it's better to have the Boston of your imagination, because
Victorian Boston is the Boston of people's dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, Boston has changed enough so that a Doubleday editor
questioned Zaroulis's placement of MIT in the Back Bay. `` `Isn't
it in Cambridge?' she asked me. `Not until 1915,' I told her.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Victorian Boston ``is a perfect period in which to
set a mystery,'' Zaroulis says. ``If you like Anne Perry,'' and her
mysteries set in Victorian London, she adds by way of
self-promotion, ``you'll love Cynthia Peale.''
</P>
<P>
   The name change was necessitated by the publishing-world canon.
``Neither the industry nor readers,'' Zaroulis says, ``like authors
to change the type of work they have been used to seeing from
them.''
</P>
<P>
   She took the ``Cynthia'' in memory of an old friend who had
recently died, and the ``Peale'' partly for the painter Charles
Wilson Peale, but also, she admits ``to give me a spot on the
bookstore shelves between Robert Parker and Anne Perry.''
</P>
<P>
   Zaroulis insists she is ``not trying to hide'' her real
identity, and she is pleased when people bring copies of ``Call the
Darkness Light'' _ in one case, a first edition from 20 years ago _
to her ``Cynthia Peale'' readings and signings.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com, however, directs readers who might be interested in
other books by the author of ``Colonel Mann'' to Norman Vincent
Peale, the inspirational writer who died in 1979. ``I was thinking
of complaining, but then I decided, no, people just might be
intrigued and buy my book,'' Zaroulis says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of branding,'' she adds. ``I've got `Cynthia
Peale' on my mailbox in Chestnut Hill. I had a discussion with our
mailman about it. I told him we were having someone new coming to
live there and he said, that's fine, just put her name on the
mailbox.''

O: EARNESTNESS FROM WINFREY IN NEW PACKAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The cool blue debut cover of O, The Oprah Magazine, whispers
seductively about the good life, with the magazine's founder _
Oprah Winfrey _ perched comfortably in a pretty wicker chair.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a mere 20 pages later, Winfrey's magazine preaches
passionately about the right life, offering a ``Tap Your Personal
Courage'' calendar filled with exhortations to ``ask yourself, what
was I created to do?''
</P>
<P>
   Set to hit the newsstands Wednesday, O reads a lot like Eleanor
Roosevelt meets Martha Stewart. Perhaps that's the natural
outgrowth of a venture between Hearst Magazines _ publisher of such
tried and true women's lifestyle publications as Cosmo and Good
Housekeeping _ and Winfrey, with her emphasis on the spiritual
roots of self-help.
</P>
<P>
   Where else would you find an ad for ``Oprah's Personal Growth
Summits,'' next to a piece on PMS remedies. Or a series of
inspirational quotes from Ralph Waldo Emerson and Maya Angelou
vying for space with ``Five Fabulous Things to Do With Fresh
Strawberries''? Or a piece from sharp-elbowed political partisan
Peggy Noonan gushing that the ``sheer joy'' of hard work is ``a
bubbling happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   If as Winfrey writes, O is a magazine that asks women to ``peel
back the layers and excavate the real you,'' it delivers that
painful-sounding message with a velvet glove. There are pages and
pages of traditional fashion and beauty features, as well as food
and design coverage. There is mild celebrity worship as Tina Turner
admits her weakness for scary movies, and Camille Cosby sits down
for an interview with Winfrey. (Winfrey's first question -_ are
``you are aware of your womanness?'' _ suggests she's a much better
TV than print interviewer, but the session later picks up steam.)
</P>
<P>
   At its core, however, O is a resolutely upbeat and
non-ideological vehicle for preaching self-improvement and cultural
harmony. The stories focus on people like Bea Salazar, a poor woman
who managed to create a makeshift network of children's service
centers. Mixed-race author Danzy Senna writes about coming to terms
with her white grandmother, who was brilliant, combative, and
racist. And in O's one truly memorable piece of journalism, writer
Elizabeth Kim recounts her struggle to surmount her wrenching
experiences and forlorn destiny as an illegitimate child in
post-war Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Given the 166 pages of ads in the initial 318-page issue, O
displays courage with a piece extolling the mental-health benefits
of shedding excess worldly goods. More typical is an article called
``Make Your Dreams Come True'' which lays out pragmatic steps _
``Excavate your true desire,'' ``Hatch a plan,'' ``Keep yourself
motivated'' _ for changing your life.
</P>
<P>
   Heart Magazines president Cathleen Black has pointedly noted
that O ``is not a television program, it's a magazine.'' But it's a
magazine placing its chips on Winfrey's phenomenal TV celebrity.
Not only does she grace the cover, she writes two columns and
interviews Cosby. The magazine's ``bookshelf'' is an extension of
Oprah's Book Club, and a major health and fitness piece includes
advice from her personal trainer.
</P>
<P>
   In O's closing column, called ``What I Know for Sure,'' Winfrey
lays out her basic philosopy that ``the happiness you feel is in
direct proportion to the love you give.''
</P>
<P>
   The Beatles _ with their lyric ``And in the end, the love you
take is equal to the love you make'' _ may have said it better. But
nobody markets it better than Winfrey.

TESTING FOR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. What is the best test or procedure that a doctor can use to
determine that a person's high blood pressure is caused by an
improper signal from the area of the brain that is supposed to
control it? What other causes of hypertension are there?
</P>
<P>
   M.W.K., Peabody, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Blood pressure is the force that keeps blood flowing around
your body. If it's too low, your body parts won't get enough oxygen
and you could die. If it's too high, you can wear out arteries and
they could burst, and again, you could die.
</P>
<P>
   High blood pressure, or ``hypertension,'' can be caused by many
things. These include narrowing of blood vessels due to drugs or
stress, or blockages in them due to a lifetime of eating junk food.
Excess blood viscosity can also contribute, as can poor elasticity
of blood vessels, or excessive blood volume, which can be
associated with eating too much salty food.
</P>
<P>
   The brain stem and hypothalamus both have some control over
blood pressure but, as you can see, they're not the only ones in
the game, and there's no immediate way to know if they're the ones
causing trouble or if it's mostly something else.
</P>
<P>
   It's not easy to single out which bit of the body is causing
high blood pressure in any single case. Unless the patient is about
to explode, doctors usually recommend cutting down on salt to try
to stop the body filling up with water to dilute it, to start
exercising, to reduce stress, and to cut down on foods that
encourage gunk to clog their circulatory systems. If this isn't
enough, the brain control system may become suspect, though other
organs may be involved and a combination of tests and attempts at
controlling the high blood pressure with drugs will begin. In the
event of a brain-related problem, doctors may well elect not to dig
around in there in case they mess up, and rather than having your
high blood pressure ``cured,'' you may wind up managing it as a
chronic illness.

EX-FLIGHT CHIEF RECALLS `LET'S DO IT' DAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOUGLAS BAILEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thirty years ago this week, Gene Kranz was celebrating the US
space agency's most successful failure, an event he himself dubbed
``NASA's finest hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Kranz, the former fighter pilot who served as flight director
for most of the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo missions in the 1960s
and early 1970s, was at the helm in Houston's Mission Control when
engineers had to improvise a risky and untested rescue plan after
an explosion crippled the Apollo 13 spacecraft when it was halfway
to the Moon.
</P>
<P>
   Although the mission was indeed a failure _ it was intended to
be NASA's third Moon landing _ the three astronauts returned safely
and the mission provided perhaps the most easily absorbed drama of
any spaceflight before or since. Hollywood certainly recognized
this when it chose Apollo 13, not Apollo 11, as the first mission
to be memorialized in film. And, it could be argued that the flight
contributed more phrases to the popular lexicon than others.
``Houston, we have a problem,'' is heard more than ``That's one
small step . . .'' And, although he didn't actually utter it,
Kranz's ``failure is not an option'' command to his troops during
the Apollo 13 crisis in the movie has become the battle cry for
managers everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   It's also the title of Kranz's just-published book, which
recounts his incredible career in the space program during that
heady decade when the Moon was just a four-day rocket ride away. In
it, Kranz writes that the improvisation within Mission Control's
boiler room that saved Apollo 13 was only the most glaring example
of a space agency that was making it up as it went along.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we thought we reached a plateau, they moved the
objective farther out,'' said Kranz in an interview Monday. ``And
we saluted and said, `We'll do it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   For Kranz, who still speaks in the clipped, no-guff phrasing
made famous by actor Ed Harris's portrayal of him in the movie,
``Apollo 13,'' the space flights were a series of dramatic near
misses, not the perfectly executed missions most appeared to be.
But, by the time of Apollo, Kranz and his team of young flight
engineers (most in their mid-20s) had become masters of innovation,
management and planning who believed entirely in their abilities to
do the audacious.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were given the opportunity to show what America can do,''
he said. ``It was almost like President Kennedy grabbed an idea
from the 21st century and said, `Let's do it now.' It might have
been more logical to do the space station then and eventually go to
the Moon in this century. But we really got ahead of ourselves
because we were in a Cold War.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Kranz said, the nation needs leaders willing to make a
stand on space exploration, and the public needs to get excited
about it. But he doesn't know what it will take to jump-start a new
space era.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might take a crisis,'' he said. ``One would be a
recognition that we're not developing technology as quickly as
other countries are. Or maybe we'll realize that space technology
can solve some of our environmental problems like global warming.''
</P>
<P>
   But you'll never justify space travel on pure economics, Kranz
said, unless you can consider what a renewed space effort would
contribute to technological progress, the formation of new
companies, and educational initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're short-timers. We want to measure results in six- to
12-month increments,'' he said. ``But if you really want to measure
it, you have to ask yourself where you want this country to be in
10 or 20 years, and could reviving the space program get us there.
I think it could.''
</P>
<P>
   Now retired, and still a booster of NASA itself, he has harsh
words for the present NASA brass, and blames the recent string of
highly publicized satellite failures on their reliance on faddish
management techniques and an unwillingness to foster debate with
their ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those weren't NASA failures, they were management failures,
pure and simple,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he's not opposed to an occasional PR stunt, like letting
Senator John Glenn take a ride on the Shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't understand the risk he took in his first Mercury
flight,'' he said. ``Those Atlas boosters were exploding all the
time and he was willing to climb on top of one not knowing if it
was the third good or the fourth bad one. He deserved it.''

   When he was 19, Paul Parks enlisted in the Army and became part
of the bloody European campaign to defeat the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   But after helping rid the world of a heinous totalitarian
regime, Parks and his black comrades came home from battle to
segregated bathrooms and water fountains, and seats at the back of
public buses.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people still don't know that blacks played a major
role in World War II, and I think that's unfortunate,'' said Parks,
now 77, a longtime civil rights activist and former Massachusetts
education secretary. ``The conditions that we faced in the military
and the conditions that we returned to after the war was over were
outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks and other black war veterans across the country are
pushing for a national Day of Honor next month to remember those
who fought for their country in a segregated military rife with
racism.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy is backing their effort to have
President Clinton and Congress set aside May 25 as a special day of
commemoration for all minority soldiers who fought in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because history books and the media have not told the story of
the contribution of minorities to World War II, most Americans are
not aware that in spite of racism at home and on the battlefield,
men and women of color stood shoulder to shoulder with other
Americans,'' said William H. Smith of Marlborough, Mass., one of
those behind the national effort.
</P>
<P>
   The time to remedy that, Smith and others say, is long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   The experiences of black soldiers in Word War II have gone
largely unrecorded, many say. Few documentaries, for example, have
highlighted their heroism on the beaches of Normandy during D-Day.
School textbooks, for the most part, have ignored their valor under
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Even Hollywood has not given them their due, some black war
veterans say. Many were disappointed that Steven Spielberg's 1998
blockbuster ``Saving Private Ryan'' did not include any black
faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``These black veterans have incredible stories,'' Smith said.
``World War II is the preeminent event of this century and blacks
and other minorities are perceived as having not served. We know
that's not true _ in fact, they served under conditions that have
since been condemned.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who runs a multimedia service, knew little about minority
war veterans until the Army hired him to produce a documentary,
``African-Americans in World War II: A Legacy of Patriotism and
Honor.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 film has been shown on military bases nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   As he interviewed dozens of black veterans and combed through
archives, Smith came to understand that minorities played a key
role in the war.
</P>
<P>
   Black soldiers like Parks were ordered to activate and
deactivate land mines throughout southern England and France. The
Rev. Arthur Joseph Jr., now an ordained minister in Houston,
transported German soldiers to Allied prison camps after they
surrendered. And Colonel John B. Roach, an original Tuskegee airman
who flew B-25 bombers and now lives in Woburn, Mass., shot down
several German planes.
</P>
<P>
   In all, about 1.2 million African-Americans served alongside
300,000 Hispanic-Americans and 50,000 Asian-Americans in World War
II, according to the National Association of Black Veterans Inc.,
based in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were there,'' Smith said, noting that the percentage of
black soldiers during the war paralleled the black population in
America.
</P>
<P>
   As Smith toured the country promoting the Army documentary, some
black veterans asked him to make another one that examined the
harsh experiences of racism black soldiers faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one of the screenings, a few of the men came up to me
afterwards and said `Thank you, Brother Smith, for showing a
picture of us,'' Smith said. ``But you know you didn't really talk
about the terrible conditions that we lived in.'''
</P>
<P>
   So, using his own money, Smith made and last year released ``The
Invisible Soldiers: Unheard Voices,'' a documentary that chronicles
through interviews and archival footage the conditions black
soldiers encountered in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a (captured) German soldier who once asked me why I was
fighting in this war,'' said Joseph, 82, who volunteered to go
overseas in summer 1941. ``I told him that I always wanted to be a
soldier and that I had joined the Army because my government asked
me to.''
</P>
<P>
   During the war, Joseph kept a diary of the mistreatment he and
other black soldiers endured at the hands of their white superiors.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daddy was a soldier in World War I, and I really believed
in my heart that things would change for blacks back at home if we
won the war over in Europe,'' he said. ``Of course, that didn't
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Stories like Joseph's inspired Smith to push for the day of
recognition. The effort has been gaining momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to support a congressional resolution
introduced last week by Kennedy and US Representative Sheila
Jackson Lee of Texas calling for the establishment of the special
day.
</P>
<P>
   And five US mayors have agreed to mark the holiday in their
communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too often during World War II and in the years since then,
these brave men and women who fought to protect our freedom were
subjected to unfair discrimination and have never received the
recognition they deserve,'' Kennedy said in a statement. ``On land,
sea and air, far from their homes, they fought brilliantly to
defeat facism and protect our freedom. And large numbers of them
did so in spite of the racism and injustice they had suffered in
our society.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he hopes the Day of Honor will force Americans to
reflect on an important and ugly chapter in history. ``The goal of
this day is to formally say thank you as a nation to a generation
whose service paved the way for freedoms African-Americans and
other minorities enjoy today,'' he said. ``It is also a measure of
social and moral reparations _ paying respect to those who served
under the yoke of suffering and discrimination.''

BUILDING A BETTER ARTIFICIAL HEART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Designing an artificial heart seems like a straightforward
engineering problem. The heart, after all, is not a space shuttle.
It has just one job to do: Pump blood.
</P>
<P>
   But the agonizing early-1980s experiences of the first few
people to have their failing hearts replaced by machines showed
that it was anything but straightforward. The first artificial
heart recipient, Utah dentist Barney Clark, died after 112
miserable days on a heart pump powered by a bedside box the size of
a washing machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was simple, we would have done it a long time ago,''
said John Watson, who heads the federal government's 36-year-old
artificial heart program.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers have quietly tackled the challenges over the 17
years since Clark died, and now they say they're set to try to
again.
</P>
<P>
   The everyday work of the human heart is extraordinarily
difficult to duplicate. A healthy heart beats without fail 100,000
times a day, nearly 40 million times a year. It withstands an
environment more corrosive than seawater, due to the hundreds of
molecule-splitting enzymes in blood. It moves a tremendous volume
of blood without touching off a shower of clots than can plug an
artery in the brain. It responds instantly when the body demands
more blood flow in order to rise from a chair or climb a flight of
stairs. It remodels itself in response to increased exercise. It
even has its own self-contained, fail-safe power supply.
</P>
<P>
   Developers of the next-generation artificial heart say they have
a device that comes close enough to the real thing that most
ordinary activities will be possible _ although recipients of the
implant will have to be ever-mindful of the two-hour battery life
in the external batteries that keep the device beating.
</P>
<P>
   Watson and scientists in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania who are
developing these heart substitutes expect recipients will be able
to run ``a slow mile,'' as Watson puts it, or even sprint for a
bus, as well as engage in most occupations, and in sports such as
golf or bowling.
</P>
<P>
   Before the end of the year, according to current plans, the
first of these next-generation hearts, made by Abiomed Inc. in
Danvers, Mass., will be implanted in one or more humans. Surgeons
in Boston, Louisville, Philadelphia, Houston and Los Angeles are
training for the experiment. But there's no telling where the first
implant will be or who will get it, since that depends on where the
first suitable and willing patient pops up, once federal officials
have given the heart the green light.
</P>
<P>
   But everyone agrees on two things: The experiment will be
conducted in a fishbowl, and the stakes are do-or-die _ quite
possibly for the artificial heart program itself, as well as for
the subjects who bravely volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most visible clinical experiment'' in the world,
said David M. Lederman, Abiomed's chief executive. ``It was in the
'80s, and it will be again.''
</P>
<P>
   The risks are worth taking, Lederman and others insist, because
the number of natural hearts donated for transplants have leveled
off at about 2,000 per year, due in part to widespread use of
seatbelts and motorcycle helmets that reduce traffic fatalities
among relatively young people.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the number of Americans with failing hearts is
mounting steadily. Partly this is because doctors are more
successful these days in pulling heart attack victims back from the
brink of death, but they can't always prevent associated cardiac
damage that often leads to later heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, few expect animal-to-human heart transplants, such as
from genetically engineered pigs, to fill the demand for natural
hearts anytime soon, due to formidable obstacles, such as the
body's ferocious rejection response to cross-species transplants
and the risk of introducing animal viruses into humans.
</P>
<P>
   The new generation of artificial hearts faces very high
expectations. The field will be doomed, many say, by anything
resembling the death-watch experience of Barney Clark, who suffered
strokes and severe depression while he was tethered to the control
unit of the Jarvik-7, the first-generation artificial heart.
</P>
<P>
   The next patient, an Indiana man named William Schroeder,
survived 620 days on the Jarvik-7, but most in the field agree with
Boston ethicist George Annas that Schroeder's psychological and
physical pain proved ``there are fates worse than death.'' Even
artificial heart pioneer Robert Jarvik has abandoned the idea of a
totally implantable heart substitute in favor of tiny pumps that
merely assist failing natural hearts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sort of laid low for 10 years, quite frankly, because
Barney Clark and the others in the 1980s created a public
perception of failure,'' said Abiomed's Lederman, who is clearly
worried that expectations of the new artificial hearts will be
unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   But Boston cardiac surgeon Gregory Couper of Brigham and Women's
Hospital, one of the five centers recruited for the next round of
human trials, said he thinks the researchers must set high
standards if the artificial heart program is to survive in the
court of public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   If the first five patients in the next experiments have severe
complications, Couper warned, ``both the public's and the
profession's enthusiasm will be dampened very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We really need to ensure that we do not repeat the early
history of the Jarvik-7 heart,'' Couper added. ``We ought to have
80-plus percent of the first 15 patients surviving at six months,
free of any severe complications.''
</P>
<P>
   A tall order, but researchers and their sponsors can point to
growing reasons for confidence, much of it unknown to the public,
or even many physicians. Over the last 15 years, University of
Arizona researchers have tinkered with the Jarvik heart, overcoming
its tendency to generate blood clots and other failings so it can
be used as a ``bridge'' to carry patients until they can get a
natural heart transplant. One hundred fifty-five patients have used
it, for periods as long as 320 days.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, other researchers have developed successful
temporary pumps that take over the work of one or both of the
heart's ventricles, the main pumping chambers. Use of these
temporary ``assist devices,'' which require external power sources
like the Jarvik-7 heart, is virtually routine in many major medical
centers throughout the world. They have saved the lives of
thousands of patients, either by keeping them alive while they
await transplants, or by giving virus-damaged hearts the chance to
rest and recover. In fact, surgeons sometimes delay transplant
surgery for patients on these assist devices so that they are in
better physical shape for the rigors of a transplant.
</P>
<P>
   One of those patients is Danalyn Adams Scharf, who this week
became the first heart transplant recipient to run the Boston
Marathon. Prior to her transplant, the 28-year-old New Hampshire
woman was sustained by a temporary assist device after a virus
devastated her own heart.
</P>
<P>
   Use of assist devices as ``bridges to transplant'' is
controversial because, with a finite number of donor hearts, the
temporary pumps merely rearrange the order of transplant queues.
That's why, Lederman said, Abiomed has not requested federal
approval of its temporary bi-ventricular assist device as a
``bridge,'' and will not seek an OK to use its totally implantable
artificial heart that way.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the controversy, the widespread use of temporary
artificial heart assist devices has buoyed researchers' confidence
that they have ``engineered out'' many of the clotting, infection,
and reliability problems of the Jarvik-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bridge-to-transplant experience has done nothing but
reinforce our feelings about how well patients can do on these
devices,'' said Alan J. Snyder of The Pennsylvania State
University, which is developing a totally implantable artificial
heart that will be ready for human tests in 2001 or 2002.
</P>
<P>
   While heart surgeons have been accumulating this clinical
experience, engineers have been exploiting new technologies in
biomaterials, batteries, and miniaturization. Together, these
advances make possible a device that is totally implantable, with
an internal battery that puts out enough power _ about the same
needed by a 15-watt light bulb _ to run the artificial heart for an
hour before needing to be recharged.
</P>
<P>
   The internal battery is recharged by 4-pound, lithion-ion
batteries with a two-hour charge that are worn on a belt. Their
charge is transmitted by radio-frequency waves from an external
transmitter to an internal receiver disc the size of a large cookie
implanted in the abdomen. This eliminates the need for any tubes or
wires protruding through the skin _ a source of infection in the
early artificial heart and temporary assist devices.
</P>
<P>
   Computer technology enables researchers to give the latest
artificial heart a ``brain,'' also implanted in the abdomen, that
senses increased demand for blood output and automatically steps up
heart rate. The control unit also will transmit readings on the
artificial heart's performance _ its rate, internal pressures, and
output _ by radio to doctors at the bedside, across town, or across
the country to a ``mission control'' in Danvers.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Abiomed heart has been implanted in about 45 calves
in Louisville, and Penn State researchers have tried their unit in
about as many calves. The devices have not been trouble-free, but
researchers say thay have gradually ``designed out'' the bugs and
improved reliability to a point that justifies human tests. While
the calves do well, even trotting on treadmills, they outgrow the
heart's pumping capacity within three months.
</P>
<P>
   But which humans should be the first to receive the new
artificial hearts? Lederman said the company is planning to offer
it to three groups of patients:
</P>
<P>
   --The roughly 750 patients a year whose immune systems are
chronically rejecting the heart transplants and have no other
disqualifying complications. Because the artificial heart is
experimental, researchers would face ethical problems if they
implanted one in a person who otherwise could have received a heart
transplant;
</P>
<P>
   --Patients who couldn't be ``weaned'' from heart-lung bypass
machines after undergoing cardiac surgery, or from temporary assist
devices, a group that may total 6,000 annually;
</P>
<P>
   --Victims of massive heart attacks who have only days to live,
and are unlikely to get a heart transplant in time, a group that
may number 50,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Others differ about some of these candidates. Surgeon Couper,
for instance, said he thinks heart attack patients will present
logistical problems as well as difficulties in obtaining informed
consent, since these patients, by definition, will be deathly ill.
</P>
<P>
   Annas, the Boston University ethicist, agreed that patients in
shock following a major heart attack ``can't possibly give
consent.'' He also questions the quality of life among artificial
heart recipients who must be ever-vigilant about the life left in
their two-hour batteries, or about big downstream issues about how
many would get artificial hearts if the upcoming trials are
successful, and who would pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that doesn't mean I don't think we shouldn't be doing
artificial heart research,'' said Annas, one of the leading critics
of the earlier round of artificial heart trials. ``If we had a
totally implantable artificial heart that the recipient could
really forget about, I think that would be a good thing.''

INCREASE IN DOG DISEASE HAS VETS WONDERING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VICKI CROKE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Quincy, an active and hardy 7-year-old mutt, worried her owners,
Thomas and Rosemary Rennicks, when, in the course of three days,
she went from a being a normal, healthy dog to one who could hardly
use her hind legs. She couldn't get off the bed. And she refused
even a dog biscuit.
</P>
<P>
   Bundling her off to veterinarian Mary Labato at the Tufts
University School of Veterinary Medicine last month, the Rennicks,
who live in Worcester, learned that Quincy was sick with
leptospirosis, something they'd never heard of.
</P>
<P>
   Leptospirosis is a sometimes deadly disease caused by
spiral-shaped bacteria of the genus Leptospira and is spread by
contact with the urine of an infected animal. This could occur if
an animal with leptospirosis urinates in standing water, and
another comes along and drinks from the source. It can be treated
with antibiotics such as doxycycline or penicillin if caught early.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, the disease can be transmitted from dogs to
humans, but it is a rare occurrence and, according to Dr. Bela
Matyas of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, there have
been no recorded cases of the disease in humans in Massachusetts
for at least a decade. Some experts believe the frosty New England
winters kill off much of the bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   But, for some unknown reason, there appears to be an increase in
cases in dogs in the state. Veterinarians don't know if this is
because more cases are simply being detected or if the disease is
on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 and 1996, the vets at Tufts' Foster Hospital for Small
Animals saw no cases of dogs with leptospirosis. But in 1997, there
were 13 cases; that rose to 16 in 1998, and 17 last year. Dr. Linda
Ross of the Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine
explained that you cannot pick upleptospirosis just from patting or
playing with your dog, or even having the dog lick your face. You
have to come into contact with an infected dog's urine, and this is
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Any mammal can contract the disease (cats get it more rarely
than dogs). In addition to being picked up through tainted water or
food, it can be transmitted through mucous membranes or a cut in
the skin.
</P>
<P>
   While relatively uncommon in the United States, leptospirosis
thrives in some tropical countries, where it does kill humans. It
is generally carried in the rodent population, and is transmitted
to people who drink, bathe or wash clothing in infected waterways.
</P>
<P>
   This knowledge should make you hesitate before dipping a toe in
a pond in Madagascar, but you should not waste a moment worrying
that you'll get the disease from your dog. You are far more likely
to get it from a rodent in Nicaragua than a dog in Natick.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the largest outbreaks of leptospirosis occur in
places where there is a breakdown in sanitation and water sources
are fouled. In the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch in 1998, for
example, at least 68 people were diagnosed with leptospirosis in
Honduras, and the disease caused at least four deaths. Those who
have been infected in the United States are generally people who
work on farms, or are veterinarians or sewer workers.
</P>
<P>
   It can take two days to four weeks, but usually one to two
weeks, between exposure to the bacteria and the development of
disease. Symptoms in people include high fever, headache, chills,
muscle aches, vomiting and perhaps jaundice. And for dogs, symptoms
may include fever (normal body temperature for a dog is 100.5 to
102.5 F), loss of appetite, lameness, and lethargy.
</P>
<P>
   Once suspected, the bacteria can be detected through blood and
urine tests. With some people and dogs, there are no symptoms at
all and the infection resolves on its own. Others develop
respiratory distress, kidney damage, meningitis, or liver failure.
This serious phase of the illness is known as Weil's disease.
</P>
<P>
   With early detection, dogs are given fluid therapy and a minimum
of four weeks of antibiotics. Even in cases of renal failure,
therapy can reverse the situation. But Tufts' Ross said the results
simply are not predictable: Some animals get better, others die,
and still others survive, but with residual kidney problems.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Quincy is recovering nicely. After five days in the
hospital receiving intravenous fluids and weeks of antibiotics, she
is her old self again.
</P>
<P>
   So, how do you prevent your dog from contracting leptospirosis?
That turns out to be a rather cloudy issue. Simple measures include
keeping the areas around your home rodent free, since rodents can
carry the bacteria. You could also try to prevent your dog from
splashing around in and drinking standing water (easier said than
done), such as puddles in the woods that might be contaminated with
wild animal urine. And you can help keep wildlife away from your
house by making sure your trash cans are covered, and not leave pet
food outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   There are vaccines for leptospirosis, but their efficacy is
debatable. Even though the Rennickses hadn't realized it, Quincy
had, in fact, been vaccinated against leptospirosis, but not
against the strain the dog contracted. Vaccines do not exist for
all strains. Worldwide, there may be as many as 200 strains, each
adapted to a particular environment. It's best to discuss the issue
of vaccination with your own vet, who will have a good idea about
whether other dogs in your area have been infected.
</P>
<P>
   Five strains have been found in New England. Ross of Tufts
explained that leptospira interrogans canicola and leptospira
interrogans icterohemorrhagiae were traditionally considered to be
the agents causing leptospirosis in dogs. Now vets are finding
three new strains _ pomona, grippotyphosa and bratislava.
</P>
<P>
   This makes Dr. Robert Cook, chief veterinarian with the Wildlife
Conservation Society, wonder whether leptospirosis should come
under the umbrella of suspicion for emerging diseases, although it
is still considered rare. The society played a critical role in
identifying the outbreak of the West Nile encephalitis virus in New
York last summer, which killed seven people.
</P>
<P>
   The Rennickses are hopeful that Quincy will make a full
recovery. Until the vet is certain Quincy's urine is clear of the
bacteria, her owners will have to do something they feel a little
silly doing, but it will help prevent the spread of the disease:
They must stalk the dog and spray bleach onto every urine puddle
she produces in order to kill the bacteria. They will be able to
stop when Quincy gets a clean bill of health from the vet.
</P>

CONTROVERSIAL BISHOP PUBLISHES NEW BOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW PAULSON AND DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bishop John Shelby Spong is at it again.
</P>
<P>
   His newest book, ``Here I Stand,'' published earlier this year
will likely do nothing to change Spong's standing, among critics
and admirers, as one of the most controversial American Christian
prelates of recent times.
</P>
<P>
   Spong, who retired in February after 24 years as Episcopal
bishop of Newark and is now teaching and lecturing at Harvard
University, has been branded a heretic by detractors for his views
questioning Christian tenets like Jesus's virgin birth and the
resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters hail Spong as a hero for his championing of
women's and, particularly, gay causes, including the ordination of
gays and lesbians as Episcopal priests, as well as his rhetorical
challenges to the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   In his latest book, an autobiography subtitled, ``My Struggle
for a Christianity of Integrity, Love &AMP; Equality,'' Spong, 68,
minces no words in targeting his long-time foes. He refers to
fundamentalist Protestantism, the theological fuel for the
religious right, as ``ill-informed, prejudiced, close-minded and
doctrinaire.''
</P>
<P>
   And as he surveys the religious landscape, Spong bemoans what he
considers a demoralizing topography.
</P>
<P>
   ``A strident fundamentalist Protestantism, an antiquated Roman
Catholicism, and an irrelevant Orthodox tradition,'' Spong writes,
are ``the major expressions of Christianity at the dawn of the
twenty-first century. There is no leaven in that ecclesiastical
lump and no candle left to shine in that ecclesiastical darkness. I
see no hope for a Christian future in any of them.''
</P>
<P>
   His condemnation won't surprise conservative believers,
including fellow Episcopal bishops, who say Spong has abandoned
Christian values and embraced a popular culture _ reflected in the
mass media _ with questionable sexual mores and a hostile attitude
toward religion.
</P>
<P>
   After Spong's 1998 book, provocatively entitled, ``Why
Christianity Must Change or Die,'' was released, his opponents
published a response, a collection of essays called ``Can a Bishop
Be Wrong?''
</P>
<P>
   In it, Episcopal Bishop James M. Stanton of the diocese of
Dallas, states: ``The fundamentalist has no better friend than John
Shelby Spong. No one demonstrates better the futility of liberal
religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Spong, in a recent interview at the Harvard residence where he
is living, said he never deliberately set out to become an
iconoclast nor is he, as some critics assert, simply interested in
attracting publicity.
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, Spong's tumultuous career has been one long
response to the environment he encountered in his native North
Carolina, which was dominated by fundamentalist Christians who
believed the Bible was the inerrant word of God.
</P>
<P>
   It also was a world, Spong noted, characterized by racism,
sexism, anti-Semitism and homophobia. And the Bible, he said, was
often used to buttress this intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people just don't buy that and the culture has moved
way beyond that,'' said Spong who also wrote a popular book
entitled ``Rescuing the Bible from Fundamentalism. ``The religious
right believes they represent God and if you disagree with them you
disagree with God. Americans don't want to persecute anyone's
religious views, but they also aren't interested in having
religious views imposed on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on the responses his writings and public lectures have
generated, Spong believes many Americans share his vision of
Christianity. They yearn, he believes, for a faith that is
tolerant, less dogmatic and not so focused on Biblical stories
Spong says are difficult for the 21st century mind to accept.
</P>
<P>
   In his most recent book, Spong summarizes his life's work as
having been an attempt to ``free people from the clutches of
religious systems that create a false security, provide a phony
peace and pretend to solve profound questions of life with
simplistic answers.''
</P>

 &QL; 
HOLIDAYS OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For both Christians and Jews, this week is one of the most
important of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Christians are celebrating Holy Week, which began with Palm
Sunday, which marks Jesus's entry into Jerusalem, continuing with
Holy Thursday (also called Maundy Thursday) to mark the last supper
and Good Friday the crucifixion, and concluding with Easter, which
marks Jesus's resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   Among the rituals at many churches: the distribution of palm
fronds, a reminder of the branches crowds used to welcome Jesus to
Jerusalem. Catholics, and some Lutherans and Episcopalians, will
venerate the cross on Friday; some churches hold foot-washing
ceremonies on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Orthodox Christians, because of a different calendar, will
celebrate Holy Week starting April 23.
</P>
<P>
   For Jews, Wednesday night marks the start of Passover, an 8-day
holiday marking the Jewish exodus from Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   On the first, and in some families, on the second night of
Passover, Jews hold a seder, a banquet with a liturgical text,
called a haggadah, which tells the story of the enslavement of Jews
in Egypt, the confrontation between Moses and Pharaoh, and the
escape of the Jews across a divinely-parted Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
   The seder is laden with ritual symbols, but the central practice
is the consumption of matzah, an unleavened bread. Observant Jews
do not eat bread or other fermented grain products throughout
Passover, honoring ancestors who left Egypt in such haste that they
did not have time for dough to rise.
</P>
<P>
   Question of the Week
</P>
<P>
   What is the connection between Jesus's last supper and Passover?
</P>
<P>
   Most scholars now believe that Jesus's last supper -- the last
meal Jesus ate before being crucified -- was a Passover seder.
</P>
<P>
   The gospel of John disputes this conclusion, but Mark, Luke and
Matthew all say that the last supper was a seder, and scholars have
sided with them, according to the Rev. John H. Elliott, a
University of San Francisco theologian.
</P>
<P>
   The Passover meal is the symbolic basis for the central element
of Christian ritual, the eucharist, or holy communion, which is
called in some denominations the Lord's supper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an expression of the continuity of Christianity and
Judaism and the unity of the two,'' Elliott said.
</P>
<P>
   Passover and Holy Thursday, which is the Christian commemoration
of the last supper, are both dated according to a lunar calendar,
but do not coincide because of complicated dating adjustments made
by Christian authorities.

HAITIAN ORPHAN'S STORY DRAWS NO CROWDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIAN WALKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Sophonie Telcy is 6 years old. Her mother died shortly
after bringing her to America a few months ago. Sophonie has no
desire to return to the country where she was born and, until
recently, raised. Which in her case is Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   Sophonie Telcy has no cheering sections outside the home of her
guardians, no television crews, and no celebrities forming a human
chain on her behalf. No one has suggested that her presence on
these shores constitutes a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, almost no one seems to care whether she stays or goes.
</P>
<P>
   Telcy lives with friends of her mother in Lake Park, Fla., a
suburb of West Palm Beach less than 100 miles from the Elian
Gonzalez circus. She is subject to deportation at any time. As
surely as Elian has become the poster child for resistance to the
Castro regime in Cuba, Sophonie's few advocates believe her fight
with the government is just as symbolic _ of what they view as a
glaring double standard in US immigration policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Damn right there's a race issue,'' says US Representative
Alcee Hastings, a Fort Lauderdale Democrat. ``There's disparate
treatment. The INS should not be paying attention to organized
political pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Elian soap opera has gradually exposed every social fissure
in South Florida. Among the most enduring is resentment at the
handling of Haitian immigration compared to that from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Haitians are deported at a much higher rate, turned around on
the seas more often, and have a more difficult time getting
residency status. The legal rationale for that is complicated, but
it hinges on the longstanding judgment that Cuban immigrants are
fleeing political persecution, whereas Haitians are economic
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, it owes much to the Cold War, like the Elian
battle itself. The Duvalier regime that pillaged Haiti from 1958
until 1986 was a client state of the United States, and its
successors _ some democratic, some not _ have also enjoyed
Washington's support. Castro, by contrast, was always viewed as the
political rogue of the Caribbean. The precedent of preferential
treatement for Cuban exiles was established in the early 1960s and
has been reinforced as Cuban-Americans gained political power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew there had to be other children, even in my district,
who were in the same situation as Elian, or worse,'' Hastings said
Monday. ``In five days, we found 26 kids who are orphans. Sophonie
Telcy's situation is far worse than Elian's. She has no family in
Haiti, and the government there has no policy for dealing with
orphans. She could end up living on the street if she has to go
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastings has widely been accused of grandstanding for suggesting
that the cases have anything in common. The local media have
largely ignored him, which he attributes to a longstanding feud
with The Miami Herald, which successfully crusaded for his removal
from the federal bench in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The distinction between political and economic refugees seems
far too pat to many Haitians and African-Americans here, who note
that Haitian refugees are also fleeing a political cesspool. While
Haiti has experimented with democracy, it is currently ruled by a
president, Rene Preval, who dissolved the parliament early last
year and has yet to get around to setting a date for new elections.
Just as many Cuban families tell devastating tales of loss under
Castro, many Haitians have horror stories of the Tonton Macoutes,
the blood-thirsty state police force. Every lawless country is
lawless in its own way, but surely Haitians who risk everything for
a life in America are not fleeing poverty alone.
</P>
<P>
   The cases of Elian Gonzalez and Sophonie Telcy share one thing
in common: The federal government hasn't decided what to do. It's
curious, though, that the other elements they have in common seem
to mean so little to so many here. For all the talk about freedom
and human rights from the Elian brigade, Sophonie Telcy's asylum is
a cause they don't seem to have time for.

THE SKY ISN'T FALLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Over the last 10 astonishing economic years, the
sky was first said to be falling when the Mexican peso went south
at the end of 1994, not coincidentally at the same time confidence
in Mexican self-government was headed in the same direction.
</P>
<P>
   Barely two years after that crisis, Chicken Little started
shrieking again when a devaluation of Thailand's currency set off a
financial scramble that upset applecarts not just throughout Asia
but in less advanced, emerging economies throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   And then, for good measure, the summer of 1998 brought an
additional jolt when Russia's financial system, rotten in its core,
melted down in panic.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, of course, the ability of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, after several years of relative
weakness, in order to make a production limit stick and produce a
sharp spike in prices set off a fresh round of commentary that
global recession (lead by the United States) was again in prospect.
</P>
<P>
   And now those who equate the US stock markets with the US
economy are leading a fresh chorus as preposterous equity values
concentrated in still-emerging sectors of our prosperous economy
seek a more sensibly valued floor.
</P>
<P>
   In the context of all this serial angst, the relentlessly sober
views of the International Monetary Fund deserve more attention
than they have received in the days leading up to its annual
conference here with the World Bank. It's more fun to focus on
street theater here and irrational anti-exuberance on Wall Street,
but the World economic outlook for this spring from a bunch of very
smart people with solid track records for prediction and policies
that make prediction self-fulfilling has a place, too.
</P>
<P>
   Just for the record, the IMF's estimate of the world's output of
goods and services last year has now been raised a full percentage
point from Asian financial crisis-induced pessimism of late-1998 to
a basically robust 3.3 percent. The main reasons: a shift toward
more stimulative monetary policy in the major industrial economies,
especially Europe; and the success in the short term of
stabilization and reform efforts in the developing world.
</P>
<P>
   For this year, the targets have also been raised. For the world,
the IMF puts growth after inflation at about 4.25 percent, an
especially hopeful sign because the estimate assumes healthy
progress throughout the world. According to Michael Mussa,
directors of the IMF's research department, ``All areas of the
world economy are contributing to the strengthening and growth
prospects going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the proper context for thinking about the United States,
still the source of one-fourth of the world economy's output. The
IMF now recognizes the reality of the last two quarters' rapid
growth rates and has sharply increased its estimate for this
country from only 2.5 percent last October to more than 4 percent
now, with inflation still expected to be in the 2.5 percent range.
</P>
<P>
   Using the broadest brush, the US economy in recent years has
been the major source of growth juice by far for the rest of the
world, best reflected in our huge imbalance in trade and thus
financial accounts, which are unsustainable over time and need to
come down, hopefully gradually. Now, however, the rest of the world
is growing more rapidly and the American economy will benefit in
the long run if it starts growing less rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits will be similar if the US sticks to its healthy
posture in terms of fiscal discipline, is vigilant in avoiding
inflation, relentless in reducing private and public debt burdens,
and responsible in saving more.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the main risk to the IMF's outlook in the fund's own
view is that growth in the US will be much more vigorous than
expected, not less. To the extent that happens _ with some signs of
gradually accelerating inflation already visible beyond just oil _
the monetary tightening that would be necessary by Alan Greenspan's
Federal Reserve would be much more severe and harmful to the
prospects for continued growth.
</P>
<P>
   This is really boring but really basic. The Chicken Littles have
been wrong, not by accident, but because mature people worked their
tails off to get the fundamentals as right as possible. And in
deference to a great song from a great movie, the fundamental
things really do apply as time goes by.

<TEXT>
<P>
   This is the year to visit Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot remember a year in which so many fascinating
phenomena have come together to add enrichment and depth to visits
to our country,'' said Udo Grebe, general manager of the German
National Tourist Office in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   EXPO2000 will not only be Germany's first world's fair, but also
the largest such fair to date. The fair will run June 1 through
Oct. 31 in Hannover with more than 190 nations participating. While
not official, the United States is expected to have a pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout 2000, visitors to Germany will have hundreds of
opportunities to celebrate the extraordinary life and work of
Johann Sebastian Bach, who died 250 years ago. Events began in
Eisenach where Bach was christened in 1685. Leipzig, where Bach
spent many years, will have a major cultural event, Bach 2000, July
21-30, and the year will end with a final crescendo with a New
Year's Eve concert in Leipzig's 13th-century St. Thomas Church.
</P>
<P>
   This is also the 600th birthday of Johannes Gutenberg, the
father of printing. Mainz, where he was born, will have many events
to mark his invention of movable type, a technology that changed
the world forever.
</P>
<P>
   Once every 10 years the villagers of Oberammergau perform a
Passion play recalling the last days of Jesus. The May 22-Oct. 8
performances continue a promise made in the 1600s.

HOW'S YOUR GEOGRAPHY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How's your geography? Not so good if you think the Tropic of
Cancer is a sunscreen lotion or that the Gaza Strip is a daring
Mideast dance. We don't know who originally wrote these, but
Kitty's Daily Mews (www.katscratch.com) lists more instances where
you need to brush up on your geography if you think that:
</P>
<P>
   --The $10,000 Pyramid is in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   --The Cumberland Gap gives out a pair of clogs with every set of
jeans sold.
</P>
<P>
   --The Equator is a cartoon action figure.
</P>
<P>
   --The Continental Shelf is a specialty section of the
supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   --The Bermuda Triangle is a percussion instrument in a reggae
band.
</P>
<P>
   --The Dust Bowl is Granny's old favorite dish.
</P>
<P>
   --A fault is what you find in other people.
</P>
<P>
   --A fiord is a Norwegian car.
</P>
<P>
   --You can do a research paper to find out who killed the Dead
Sea.

Foxborough, Mass. for locating this nonsense.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Travel Trivia: It's the volcanic belt surrounding the Pacific
Ocean. It's also a song by Johnny Cash. What is its name? (Answer
at end of column.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
How's that again? A Cape Cod traveler reports that he and his wife
were reading the information provided about their hotel in Puerto
Plata in the Dominican Republic. One warning said there can be ``no
toples at the pool.'' Because there were no lifeguards, they
assumed this meant ``no topples''; that is, no diving. ``How
naive!'' the traveler writes. ``It meant no topless bathing for
women.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Wildlife and comfy quarters: Combine New England's natural delights
with lodging in charming country inns, and you've got Bird/Inn
Tours. A six-day excursion, beginning Sunday, May 14, will focus on
the beauty of spring in New England, with its diverse wildlife.
Escorts will include Audubon Society guides and biologists from the
New Hampshire Department of Fish &AMP; Game. The tour, designed for
beginning and intermediate nature enthusiasts and birders, will
visit the Plum Island area in Massachusetts and remote wildlife
sanctuaries in New Hampshire's White Mountains and Great North
Woods regions. Prices, which include most meals, begin at $1,825
per person, double occupancy. For more information, call
603-464-4783 or 888-258-0841, fax 603-464-5401, e-mail
birdinn(at)karno.com or visit www.lkarno.com/birdinn. Warblers and
moose are standing by. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Mailbag: To Barbara Donchess of Canton: What you heard in Ireland
is basically correct: There is no one word in Gaelic for ``yes.''
When asked a question, a person speaking Gaelic may answer like
this:
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you going?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am.''
</P>
<P>
   (We thank Orla Carey of the Irish Tourist Board and Lorraine
Moloney of Aer Lingus for the information.) &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Advice to go: Few things are more irritating than a stain on
your clothes when you're on the road and your wardrobe is limited.
Here, from Travel Holiday, are some readily available helpers:
juice from a lemon for a spaghetti-sauce stain; lemon juice with
salt for ink on light-colored fabrics; hairspray for lipstick;
shaving cream for coffee, ketchup, or blood; and talcum powder or
NutraSweet, sprinkled on stains from salad dressing or other oils,
then brushed or rinsed off. The magazine advises working from the
opposite side of the fabric and using cold water only on non-greasy
stains. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Oh, woe: Sixty-three percent of travelers reported that they or a
companion have gotten sick while on vacation, according to a
national survey. The most common illnesses were sunburn (62
percent), motion or seasickness (34 percent), and allergies (34
percent). Other illnesses included ``Montezuma's Revenge'' (23
percent), and food poisoning (12 percent). The survey, commissioned
by Transderm Scop Transdermal Therapeutic System, a prescription
motion-sickness patch, also found that the vacationers surveyed
spend more than $1,200 per trip. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Did you guess it? The Ring of Fire.

<HEADLINE>
AN INNOVATIVE SHIP FOR THE MILLENNIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you ask two of the people closely associated with the new
Celebrity Cruises Millennium what is great about the ship, chances
are they'll talk about what you can't see.
</P>
<P>
   While the ship is breaking ground in innovations for passengers,
Demetrios Kaparis, senior vice president, new building for
Celebrity, and Richard Fain, chairman of Royal Caribbean
International, can't say enough about the ship's engines.
</P>
<P>
   The engines are gas turbine, and so you won't forget, the words
Gas Turbine will be emblazoned on both sides of the ship, which
enters service on May 31 in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers are not allowed in the engine room, nor will they be
able to see the azoids that propel the ship. But they may sense the
engines in the smoother, quieter ride promised. The engines built
by General Electric in Cincinnati will soon be making their way
into all new Celebrity and Royal Caribbean International ships.
</P>
<P>
   What passengers will see will be a ship that promises luxury,
comfort, fine dining, entertainment, shopping, and safety in a
style that, according to the line, will set the pace for the 21st
century of cruising. The Millennium will have glass-enclosed
elevators that ride on the outside of the ship and will afford an
ocean view on each journey between decks. It will have an
alternative dining room where guests can see into the kitchen (one
section of the dining room will have paneling taken from the
first-class dining room of the Olympic, sister ship to the
Titanic); there will be a lavish spa for taking water therapy to
new heights; and it will have more shops on board than any other
ship. The Millennium will have the largest percentage of ocean-view
staterooms of any cruise ship with 74 percent having verandas. Two
of the largest penthouse suites on the seas will be featured, each
with an outdoor whirlpool, along with 48 other large suites, all
with butler service. The main dining room will be on two levels
with huge expansive windows. Other features include a cinema, a
music library with 1,500 selections, an Internet cafe, a glamorous
casino, a sports deck, children's area, and an extensive
contemporary art collection throughout the ship.
</P>
<P>
   The 91,000-ton vessel will carry 1,950 guests with a crew of
999.
</P>
<P>
   The Millennium is in its final stages of construction in France.
Celebrity Cruises has assembled an international cast of designers
to create interiors that are expected to be the talk of the cruise
world. The design team of Wilson Butler Lodge of Boston is creating
the grand foyer, music library, extreme sports bar, and other
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Fain and Kaparis can't say enough about the power
plant. While the new engines will cost more to operate than diesel
engines, they point out the engines' small size allows more room
for passenger comfort, added cabins, and a cleaner atmosphere,
which meets the new stricter Alaskan environmental laws. Even
passengers near the engine room will not hear the engines, Fain
said. ``The combination of the gas turbine, steam turbine
integrated electric system with podded drive propulsion units will
create a revolution in marine propulsion technology while
introducing a new unique era in future Millennium cruise-ships
design,'' said Kaparis.
</P>
<P>
   Like all Celebrity ships, the food service is expected to be
superb, but the Millennium will be just a cut above the line's
other ships with the introduction of a specialty dining room, the
Olympic. Like all Celebrity ships, the food service is overseen by
Michel Roux, a renowned French chef whose Waterside Inn near London
consistently wins three stars by Guide Michelin. The Olympic will
provide a new dining experience. The alternative dining room
seating 134 guests will have 10 chefs, with each cooking for about
13 guests, providing what Roux said will be ``the highest level of
service and gastronomy available onboard any large cruise vessel
today.'' Tableside cooking will also be offered.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity targets guests between 35-54 with a household income
of $75,000. The passenger list, Celebrity said, includes about 93
percent couples, 5 percent families with children, and 2 percent
singles. It added that 83 percent of its passengers are from the
United States and 14 percent international.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity is Royal Caribbean's premium cruise line, but like all
cruise ships, by booking early, travelers can enjoy the luxury
without paying a premium price. A seven-night Caribbean cruise this
fall begins at $1,795 but the early booking price is $1,199.
</P>
<P>
   This more than promises to be the ship of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The ship is the first of a series of Millennium-class ships by
the line. The second will be the Infinity also under construction
at Chantiers de l'Atlantique in St. Nazaire, France. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boston cruises &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boston's cruise season begins this week. The Norwegian Majesty
returns for another season of 27 weekly embarkations to Bermuda. In
addition to the Majesty, three cruise lines have added embarkations
from the Black Falcon Cruise Terminal in South Boston. Two of the
lines are new to Boston. The first, Premier Cruise Lines, launches
36 cruises aboard the SeaBreeze alternating between two-night
cruises to nowhere and five-night cruises to Halifax, Nova Scotia,
and Saint John, New Brunswick. Another Premier vessel, The Big Red
Boat II, will make 20 port-of-call visits during its New
England/Canada itineraries out of New York. Carnival Cruises has
three cruises scheduled out of Boston _ one three-day cruise to
Saint John and two four-day cruises to Halifax and Saint John.
Cunard Line's Queen Elizabeth 2 will offer four theme transatlantic
cruises from Boston to Southampton, England, in May, June, and
September.
</P>
<P>
   A record-setting 116 ship calls are scheduled at the Black
Falcon Cruise Terminal this year. Some 200,000 passengers are
expected with an economic impact on the region estimated at $50
million.
</P>
<P>
   Also this season, Silverseas' Cruise Line's Silver Wind, a
296-passenger luxury class ship, arrives in Boston after a 10-day
Atlantic crossing from Dublin on Sept. 22 for a Sept. 23
embarkation to New England/Canadian ports. The line's brand new
ship, Silver Shadow, visits on Oct. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Caribbean's Splendour of the Seas makes four embarkations
to New England and Canadian ports. Princess Cruises' Crown Princess
visits six times. Holland America's Maasdam visits four times,
including a 10-day New England/Canada sailing from Boston. Other
cruise lines visiting Boston include Dolphin, Clipper, Regal, and
Seabourn.

<P>
   St. Thomas in the US Virgin Islands is looking to convert cruise
passengers into future resort guests. The West Indian Company
Limited and the St. Thomas-St. John Hotel and Tourism Association
are setting up Welcome Centers along the St. Thomas dock. At these,
cruise passengers will be greeted and encouraged to complete a
short questionnaire card with their name and address. As an
incentive to supply the information, each adult who fills out a
card is entered into that month's free vacation sweepstakes, a
six-day vacation on St. Thomas. The information supplied on the
cards will be used for mailings with promotional materials and
special vacation offers on the islands. The information kiosks will
also have information on the islands' resorts and attractions.
Similar incentives are planned for St. Croix. Cruise ships bring
1.6 million visitors to the island every year, said Rafael Jackson,
acting commissioner of tourism for the islands, ``One would be
foolish not to approach these people and ask them to come back.''
For more information on the islands or the program, call the
visitors' bureau at 800-372-USVI. &QL;

SKINNY STRIP OF EARTH SEEKS COMPATIBLE NAME  
 WHERE DOES YOUR GARDEN GROW? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Summer in the city will be better than ever now that so many
homeowners are planting flowers not only in front of their houses,
but in that little strip of dirt between the sidewalk and the curb,
too. On one street in my neighborhood, tall orange daylilies line
almost a whole block, fluttering and dancing in the breeze in fine
Wordsworthian style. There's only one problem with this burgeoning
floral trend: What do we call that curbside planting strip?
</P>
<P>
   In much of my native Midwest, it's a tree lawn. But tree lawn
sounds a bit grand for the scrubby 14-inch ribbon of earth on a
semi-urban street, and besides, none of my Boston-bred colleagues
know the term. My queries have brought, so far, some quizzical
looks, shakes of the head, and one ``It isn't berm, is it?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, it could be, but not in Boston: Berm for the sidewalk
strip is a Great Lakes usage, according the Dictionary of American
Regional English. Other parts of the country call it devil strip or
planting strip or terrace. But surely Boston and the Northeast _ a
civilized territory that knows the value of sidewalks _ should have
a label for this streetside strip.
</P>
<P>
   If it does, please let me know, you native speakers out there in
your sprouting gardens; if it doesn't, let's find one. Fill in the
blank: ``This year I want to plant something different in my
-----.'' A place that's still fighting to call its soda pop tonic
and its milkshakes frappes should be able to come up with a
colorful name for a floral fringe along the curb.
</P>
<P>
   Not that local lingo is in danger of dying out. Despite the
leveling influence of television and radio, regional accents and
idioms are flourishing, according to recent linguistic studies. And
as someone who hails from a lexical border area _ to the north were
seesaws and faucets, to the south teeter-totters and spigots _ I
find regional variations more fascinating than frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is so tolerant. Boston has a goodly share of
citizens who wait and stand on line, but as long as 40 years ago,
some usage commentators were complaining about it, warning that on
line could displace the more usual in line.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on line, they seem to agree, began as a New York City
idiom. And from the '60s to the '80s, language watchers believed
the use was spreading, or at least becoming more recognizable: It
finds its way into print in Houston, for example, in the '80s.
Magazine editors and television writers, they theorized, were
helping to spread the virus.
</P>
<P>
   But is standing on line really spreading? And if so, will the
Internet's appropriation of on line (and on-line and online) stop
it dead, any minute now?
</P>
<P>
   The evidence from the Globe's 22 years of electronic records was
surprising: Even in Boston, probably second only to New York in the
conversational use of standing (or waiting) on line, the on line
idiom is rare in print. The peak year for on line in the New York
sense was 1978, when six different stories used it _ and one of
them was a jeremiad by a native Bostonian incensed by the invasion
of on line, which he took for a ``pseudo-British affectation.''
Standing in line, by contrast, is so common the computer refuses to
count it: ``Your search is too general,'' it tells me.
</P>
<P>
   And now, even The New York Times has repudiated standing on
line. The latest edition of the newspaper's stylebook, published
last year, says, ``In most of the English-speaking world, people
stand in line. Use that wording.''
</P>
<P>
   This ruling means that over time, as editors' ears adapt to the
new order, the Times will print standing on line only in
quotations. This doesn't mean it will disappear from the language;
we need lots of expressions we would rarely put into type, like a
whole nother thing and put the groceries in the way back. But it
may turn out to be simpler if we all get in line, and reserve
waiting on line for those interminable seconds we spend staring at
our struggling computer screens.

<P>
   He was a central actor in one of history's greatest moments, and
yet we have available to us mere shreds of his life. But that
hasn't stopped writers across the ages from trying to flesh out the
remains of Pontius Pilate.
</P>
<P>
   The mythology that has grown around Pilate is enormous. To some,
he was the ultimate villain _ the man who condemned Jesus, a man
who is central to this Holy Week for Western Christians.
</P>
<P>
   To others, who have sought to cast blame on the Jews of the
time, he was an honorable figure who capitulated to the demand that
Jesus be put to death.
</P>
<P>
   To others, he was a politician willing to sacrifice an
apparently innocent man to keep the peace in a restive outpost of
the Roman Empire.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ann Wroe, the American editor of the Economist, weighs in
with her own thoughts,in a compelling, eloquent and vivid work that
offers a complex portrait of Pilate as neither all good nor all
evil. Hers is an ambivalent Pilate, who when faced with the
decision nearly chose to risk it all, but in the end threw up his
arms, sent Jesus to the cross and then wrote a memo to Rome
defending his actions.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever one chooses to ascribe to Pilate, our fascination with
the fifth governor of Judea has endured over time because, in
``Pontius Pilate,'' Wroe says, ``he stands at the center of the
Christian story and of God's plan of redemption.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without his climactic judgment of Jesus, the world would not
have been saved. Without Christ's death _ pronounced by Pilate _
there would have been no Resurrection, no founding Christian
miracle,'' she writes. ``To have a faceless bureaucrat at the heart
of all this drama was unacceptable: Something had to be made of
this man.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course there is precious little with which to make something
of Pilate: a few paragraphs from a handful of early Roman histories
and, of course, the well-known accounts in the New Testament. Each
of these, however, is colored by the author's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Even Pilate's actual name is unknown, as is his place of birth.
He might have come from a region south of Rome, or he might have
been born in Seville, Spain, or in a town on the Rhine. A clear
picture of Pilate is frustratingly impossible.
</P>
<P>
   But in a superb blend of scholarship and creativity, Wroe weaves
together the many legends that have grown around Pilate into a rich
tapestry that brings this elusive, yet pivotal, figure to life in
the reader's imagination. Pilate was an ``obstinate, proud,
patriotic, cunning, flippant and heavy-handed'' man, Wroe writes,
and an ``immature and hotheaded'' governor ``who seems less on the
edge of destroying the Jews than of destroying himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Pilate found himself ruling over a volatile corner of the Roman
Empire, the Jewish land whose inhabitants believed they were God's
chosen people, and so were superior to the Romans. Wroe starkly
illustrates how the combination of Pilate's personality and the
Jews' resistance inevitably led to conflict.
</P>
<P>
   And it was these confrontations, Wroe intriguingly intimates,
that set the stage for Pilate's encounter with Jesus. This fierce
and cocky representative of the most powerful empire on earth could
not have his way with the Jews: Their ultimate loyalty was to God,
not Caesar. Instead, Pilate sought an uneasy coexistence with his
subjects, making sure to maintain stability over Judea not because
he harbored any great fondness for the Jews but he feared, more
than anything else, incurring Rome's wrath.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus proved a menace to Pilate's tenure because he challenged
the system; his religious convictions were secondary. Jesus, Wroe
writes, ``threatened the established order in two ways: He
proclaimed indifference to it, seeming to recognize laws of his
own, and he was connected by his followers with `kingship' of a
peculiar and ungraspable sort.''
</P>
<P>
   In a splendidly written section, Wroe depicts a vacillating
Pilate interrogating Jesus, agonizing over his judgment, and
leaning toward mercy. But in the end, when the chief priests who
had condemned Jesus to die won to their side the crowd gathered
outside Pilate's home in Jerusalem, Pilate chose a momentous and
notorious path.
</P>
<P>
   Pilate, Wroe notes, was trapped by his own misdeeds. ``For even
if he wanted to be merciful in this case, he dared not be if it
would lead to a blistering report to Rome of everything else he had
done,'' she writes.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the efforts by some chroniclers to lay the blame for
Jesus's death primarily at the feet of the chief rabbis, Wroe makes
a compelling case that Pilate ultimately bears responsibility. Wroe
does a masterful job of forcing us to think about Pilate in new
ways _ as a man wracked by pain, doubt and guilt who sealed his
fate for millennia to come, and of his own accord.
</P>
<P>
   At a singular moment in history, Pilate had the potential ``for
darkness or light . . . He could take untraveled roads, open hidden
doors, escape the bounds of earth and flesh, exceed himself. Or he
could stay as he was: shrug, scratch his ear, write another
memorandum. He stayed as he was. As most of us do.''

   PAST IN PERIL: As the oldest archaeological site in the world,
Pompeii provides an unsettling glimpse of what can happen when the
past is unearthed with no plan for the future. Since the ruins were
discovered in 1748, more than two-thirds of the 163 acres within
the city's walls have been unearthed. Today, more than 1,500 of
Pompeii's buildings and 215,000 square feet of frescoed walls stand
exposed. To the sun. To the rain. To fast-growing vines. And to 2
million visitors whose fascination with the ruins is hastening
their destruction.

&HT;     HI-TECH GADGETS HELP DRIVERS FIND THEIR WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Men generally don't ask for directions. It's one
of those rules of masculinity.
</P>
<P>
   But most men will play with the newest gadgets on the market,
even though one of those gadgets just might also direct him to a
destination that he's not sure how to reach.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the new, high-tech, computerized automotive
navigation systems come in. These systems, most with their own
interactive video screens within eyesight and reach of the driver,
have been available for the past two or three years in several
different car makes.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the Global Positioning System satellite network, these
onboard navigation systems instantly determine the vehicle's
location and plot that position on a detailed map in the system's
database.
</P>
<P>
   Using that database, the driver can select a destination, and
this amazing gizmo will lead him or her to it, using either the
most direct or fastest route. Some can even be programmed to use
freeways as much as possible, or as little.
</P>
<P>
   Most also display a moving map that shows the vehicle's present
position, along with the number of miles and the length of time to
the destination, based on the car's average speed.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the driver from having to divert attention from the road
to the video screen, most of these systems also call out directions
as the trip progresses. Sure, the operator must first ask the
navigation system to direct him to a specific destination, but
that's not the same as pulling into a gas station and asking
someone how to get somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Programming the destination into an in-dash navigation system is
usually the first step. To prevent distracting the driver from the
most important task _ operating the vehicle safely _ many of the
systems only allow programming when the vehicle is stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the systems are rather easy to program. We've tried out
several of them, including one installed on a 2001 Volvo V70 wagon.
Most of the systems are installed in the front, center of the
dashboard, next to the instrument panel and just above the audio
and heating/air-conditioning controls.
</P>
<P>
   But the Volvo's navigation screen pops up out of the top of the
center of the dash and is accessed through controls mounted on the
right side of the steering wheel, so the driver can control it
without taking his hand off the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Navigation options on most of the systems include local
landmarks and tourist spots, airports, restaurants, hotels and
government buildings. But every one also allows the operator to
program in a specific street address, then directs the driver to
that location step by step.
</P>
<P>
   One notable exception to this navigation-system setup is the
General Motors OnStar system. It doesn't come with a video screen.
Instead, one push of the OnStar button on the vehicle's dashboard
connects the driver with an OnStar operator via hands-free cellular
phone. Instantaneous transmission of GPS data from the car tells
the OnStar operator exactly where the vehicle is.
</P>
<P>
   The driver can ask the OnStar operator for directions to a
specific destination, and the operator works out a route and reads
it off to the driver. The drawback here is that you still have to
ask a live person for directions, you must write those directions
down (if you're not sure you can remember them) and you have to
call the OnStar operator again if you get lost.
</P>
<P>
   There are advantages to a system such as OnStar. It's more than
just a navigation system. It's set up so the OnStar operator can
unlock the vehicle's doors, turn on the headlights or even honk the
horn by remote control.
</P>
<P>
   For safety's sake, the OnStar system automatically notifies the
operator if one of the vehicle's air bags has deployed or if the
vehicle has been in a collision. The operator will then try to call
the vehicle and, if there is no response, will automatically send
fire, police and rescue personnel to the vehicle's exact location.
There is even a button on the dash to call for help automatically
in any kind of emergency.
</P>
<P>
   The system is highly personalized. During a weeklong test-drive
of a Chevrolet Tahoe equipped with the OnStar system, I was
impressed that the operator already knew my name when I called the
first time to try out the navigation options.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I like the systems with a video screen, where you don't
have to call someone to get directions. I gave the Volvo system a
good tryout on a drive of about 270 miles. All was not perfect, but
the system got me there. Almost, that is.
</P>
<P>
   I punched in the address, and, instead of taking me right to the
house I had programmed into the system, or even the street, it took
me to a street right around the corner from where I was going. And
when it got to that wrong street, about four houses away from my
real destination, it announced to me that I had arrived. Not bad,
but not exactly what I was hoping for.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem with the navigation systems I have tested is
that they don't have a lot of common sense when it comes to
route-mapping. They will get you there, but not always by the most
direct route.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the navigation systems can be a great tool for drivers,
especially those among us who are geographically challenged.
</P>
<P>
   These systems aren't cheap, however. They run about $2,000 to
$2,500 each, and there is an additional charge for periodic updates
of the database to account for new roads and routes.
</P>
<P>
   With the OnStar system, there is an initial installation charge
of about $2,500, plus a monthly fee of about $25 to pay for the
convenience of having an operator on the other end of the line 24
hours a day, seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
   So if you have a real need for computerized, automated,
high-tech navigation and can afford it, one of these systems might
be a good idea. But a simple roadmap, which costs about $3 these
days, is a whole lot cheaper.

   CELLPHONES AND DRIVING: WHERE IT'S AGAINST THE LAW
</P>
<P>
   CITIES
</P>
<P>
   Bans exist in:
</P>
<P>
   Brooklyn, Ohio. The first ban in the nation was created a year
ago and since last Sept. 1, nearly 300 citations have been issued.
The law allows drivers to use hands-free speaker phones while
driving or to use their cell phones in the case of emergency. With
a fine of only $3 per violation, the law is intended more ro raise
public awareness of the issue than to punish.
</P>
<P>
   Hilltown Township, Consohocken, and Lebanon, Pa. These three
cities enacted bans on using cell phones while driving bans this
year after a much-publicized accident last fall in which a
2-year-old, Morgan Lee Pena, was killed by a driver talking on a
cell phone. The ban in Hilltown Township is being challenged in
court.
</P>
<P>
   New York City prohibits taxicab drivers from using cell phones
while driving.
</P>
<P>
   STATES
</P>
<P>
   This year, legislatures in 24 states considered bills to ban or
restrict cellphone use while driving. But so far, no state has
passed a law prohibiting cellphone use while driving. Bills in
Georgia, Texas and Ohio failed to proceed beyond consideration in
committee.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, three states have enacted minor measures:
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts requires drivers using cell phones to have one
hand on the wheel at all times.
</P>
<P>
   Florida bans the use of headsets. Drivers talking on cell phones
must have one ear uncovered at all times.
</P>
<P>
   California requires that written safety materials on cell-phone
use be included with all rental cars.
</P>
<P>
   Only two states, Minnesota and Oklahoma, offer law enforcement
officials a check-box on accident reports to indicate that the use
of a cell phone was a contributing factor in a accident.
Pennsylvania will soon start the practice. Other states and local
jurisdictions allow officers to write it in the report at their
discretion.
</P>
<P>
   FOREIGN COUNTRIES
</P>
<P>
   As a safety measure, 13 foreign countries have banned or
restricted the use of cell phones by motorists, though many allow
drivers to use hands-free sets.
</P>
<P>
   The countries are Germany, Japan, Australia, Brazil, United
Kingdom, Chile, Israel, Italy, Portugal, Spain, the Philippines,
Switzerland and Singapore.

 &HT;    LAWMAKERS BEGIN TO WEIGH DANGERS OF DRIVERS WITH CELL PHONES
 &HT;    1000&AMP;add. With CELL-LAWS and CELL-DATA. For release Sunday,
April 23.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLYN, Ohio _ Take heed in this working-class burg on the
southern outskirts of Cleveland. Motorcycle cop Rick Hovan has a
sharp eye out for motorists who dare to gab on their mobile phones
while cruising through town.
</P>
<P>
   Brooklyn (pop. 11,000) welcomes visitors at its city limits with
a stern reminder on roadside signs: ``Park 2 Talk. It's the Law.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first municipality in the nation to ban the use of
hand-held cellular telephones while driving, a law created last
year after a city employee changing a tire was nearly run down by a
driver with a phone to his ear.
</P>
<P>
   Driving and talking is a social epidemic nearly everyone seems
to complain about, yet nearly everyone with a cell phone does.
</P>
<P>
   Every two seconds in America, a new customer signs up for mobile
telephone service, and the total number of subscribers is already
more than 91 million. As many as 85 percent of drivers with phones
use them at least occasionally while on the road, according to a
recent survey.
</P>
<P>
   Some law enforcement officials and safety policy experts fear
that the risks will only grow as car manufacturers and the wireless
telecommunications industry team up on designs for a generation of
``smart'' cars offering built-in telephones, computer mapping
displays, Internet access and voice-activated e-mail. Ford and GM
are set to offer digital services in selected luxury models next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should drivers keep both hands on the wheel? Any reasonable
person would say, 'Of course,''' said Fran Bents, a researcher who
co-authored a 1997 study of wireless devices and driving by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite proposals introduced in at least 34 states since
1995, including Georgia and Texas, no state legislature has managed
to pass meaningful restrictions on cell phone use by motorists.
Only a handful of small cities have enacted such laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike other transportation safety issues like drunk driving
and seat belt use, you don't have a strong, well-organized national
group behind this issue, but you've got the telecommunications
industry lobbying hard against it,'' said Matt Sundeen, a policy
specialist at the National Conference of State Legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   Brooklyn, a town of trim, suburban bungalows and several robust
factories _ home of American Greetings, the greeting card maker _
passed its law in March 1999 and began enforcing it last September.
</P>
<P>
   The law bans hand-held phones, but allows hands-free devices.
About 300 tickets have been issued. With a fine of just $3 per
citation, less than a parking ticket, the law is intended to raise
public awareness, not fill the city's coffers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are tired of seeing drivers weave in and out of
traffic, paying more attention to their conversation on the phone
than what's in front of them on the road. It's a nuisance,'' said
Police Chief Jack Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   In Pennsylvania, Patricia Pena knows first-hand the danger. Her
2-year-old daughter, Morgan Lee, died last November from injuries
suffered in an accident in Hilltown Township, near Philadelphia,
when a driver on a cell phone ran a stop sign and broadsided Pena's
car.
</P>
<P>
   In suburban Gwinnett County near Atlanta, Lisa Duffner, 35, had
a similar experience as she and her family took a walk on their
quiet street. A teen-age driver on a cell phone ran up onto the
lawn, killing her 2-year-old son Ryan and the family dog in March
1999. Duffner was in a coma for three days, only to awake to the
news from her husband that Ryan was dead.
</P>
<P>
   Pena and Duffner are leading a grassroots crusade to warn of the
dangers of cell phones and driving. Pena has made appearances on
national television, including the ``Oprah'' show, and before state
lawmakers in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Duffner appeared before a Georgia legislative committee earlier
this year to support a bill. She is distributing bumper stickers
that read: ``Hang up and drive _ cell phone abuse kills,'' and
plans to create a Web site and lead a drive to convince the Georgia
legislature to act in next year's session.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people think we're trying to take away their freedoms.
Well, my son had rights, too. He had the right to live,'' said
Duffner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd go anywhere. I'd do anything to talk about this issue. I
feel I owe it to my daughter,'' Pena said in a telephone interview.
``My goal is to make this socially unacceptable, to make drivers
embarrassed to have a phone at their ear and to make people on the
other end threaten to hang up if they know the person they talking
to is behind the wheel.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Pena's accident, three Pennsylvania towns have created
laws restricting cell phone use, and some 300 municipalities around
the country are considering similar ordinances.
</P>
<P>
   Tom and Ray Magliozzi, hosts of the popular ``Car Talk'' show on
National Public Radio, also have taken up the cause. They
distribute bumper stickers declaring: ``Drive Now, Talk Later.''
</P>
<P>
   Few state and local governments keep statistics on cell phone
use as a contributing factor in traffic accidents. With a lack of
hard evidence, state legislators have been reluctant to impose
restrictions that could provoke the fury of constituents who enjoy
the convenience of cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   The mobile telephone industry and automobile manufacturers
oppose laws restricting the use of phones and other electronic
gadgets, contending that drivers simply need to be educated in
order to prevent accidents. When radios began appearing in the
first production automobiles in the early 20th century, critics of
proposed cell phone restrictions point out, some officials wanted
to ban them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single state has laws that address careless driving,
inattentive driving, reckless driving. Police know it when they see
it, whether the driver is using a radio or putting on makeup or
using a wireless telephone,'' said Lisa Ihde, who runs the public
education program for the Cellular Telecommunications Industry
Association.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The industry association has created a safety-awareness campaign
on its Web site and with a toll-free number (1-888-901-SAFE). The
industry also points to statistics that suggest that cell phones in
cars save lives. The ability of motorists to make 911 calls to
report accidents has reduced paramedic response times.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a controversial 1997 Canadian study published in the New
England Journal of Medicine concluded that the risk of an accident
increases fourfold if a driver is using a cell phone, about the
same risk as driving while drunk when measuring factors such as
reaction time and susceptibility to being easily distracted.
</P>
<P>
   The study's authors have since pointed out, though, the drinking
and driving is far more dangerous for a long list of other reasons,
such as the lingering effects of alcohol in the bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   A National Highway Transportation Safety Administration report
of 1998 crash data showed that driver distraction was a factor in
about 1 of every four fatal accidents. Cellular phones were a
factor in at least 57 deaths, compared with only seven in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   But experts consider the data to be weak because of the lack of
nationwide reporting. For the most part, an eyewitness or police
officer must see a driver on the phone to record it as part of the
accident report. Drivers involved in accidents can easily slip the
phone into a pocket or glove compartment.
</P>
<P>
   From the vantage point atop his Harley Davidson, patrolman Hovan
sees the dangers nearly every day as drivers with phones drift
across lanes and roll through stop signs.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent rainy spring day in Brooklyn, Hovan pulled over a
luxury sedan to write a ticket to a man on his cell phone. The
driver protested, saying he was a vascular surgeon who needed to
use his phone to deal with medical cases and operating-room
schedules.
</P>
<P>
   With the ticket, Hovan issued his bottom-line warning: Is
talking on the phone worth risking taking a life? Why not pull over
to finish your call?
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't want to hear it. He's got a hectic lifestyle,
emergencies, kids with him in the car,'' Hovan said. ``Everybody
thinks they have no time and they've got to be on the phone while
they drive.''
</P>
<P>
   To hammer home his message, Hovan now carries a picture of
Morgan Lee Pena, sent to him by her mother, and explains the story
of the dead Pennsylvania girl to the drivers he stops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell people, 'The city doesn't want your three dollars.
Damn, I'll give you three dollars to pay the fine. Just please be
aware of the danger,''' said Hovan. ``Some tell me they think it's
stupid, and you know what I say to people like that? 'I wonder if
you'd say the same thing if it had been your daughter.' ``

CHINESE PRESIDENT ARRIVES IN TURKEY AMID DISPUTE OVER ETHNIC TURKS
IN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ President Jiang Zemin of China arrived in
Turkey Tuesday for a long-awaited state visit, but hopes that the
two countries can build a new alliance were overshadowed by a
dispute over ethnic Turks who live in China.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey considers itself the guardian of ethnic Turks around the
world, including the 7.2 million Uighurs who live in western China.
Separatist Uighurs have begun a violent campaign against Chinese
rule, and scores have been jailed or executed, prompting protests
from Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The Uighurs, who are Muslim and speak a Turkic language, have
broad support here. Uighur nationalists maintain an office in
Istanbul, but the Turkish government, wary of provoking China,
watches them closely and does not allow Uighurs here to openly
protest Chinese rule.
</P>
<P>
   China calls the area where Uighurs live the Xinjiang Autonomous
Region, but Turkish politicians and news commentators usually call
it Eastern Turkistan. That phrase suggests that Uighurs belong not
to China but to a broad Turkic region whose inhabitants share a
culture and a language that has nothing in common with the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese authorities are determined not to give further
autonomy to the Uighur region, which is believed to have vast oil
and mineral reserves. They have closed mosques, broken up protests,
moved several million Han Chinese into the region and taken other
steps that Uighur exiles say are intended to weaken or destroy
Uighur identity.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish and Chinese leaders view their countries as natural
allies. Both are rapidly developing nations that hope to play
increasingly important roles in world politics over the coming
decades. Both resent foreign criticism of their human rights
records, and both have strong military establishments with
significant political influence.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang arrived here after a visit to Israel. China is seeking to
buy sophisticated spy planes from Israel, and Israeli leaders have
suggested that they will agree to sell them despite objections from
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey has already begun military cooperation with China. Senior
generals visit each other's headquarters regularly, and cadets
train at each other's military academies. More military accords may
be signed during Jiang's visit this week.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of closer military ties and greatly increased trade
finally convinced nationalists in the Turkish government to endorse
the visit, but they did so grudgingly.
</P>
<P>
   At a state dinner Wednesday, Jiang is to receive a medal that
can be awarded only after a unanimous vote of the Cabinet.
Ministers from the far-right Nationalist Action Party, which has
strongly endorsed the Uighur cause and condemned Chinese actions in
the Uighur region, at first resisted giving their approval but did
so at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to pursue realistic policies,'' said Abdulhaluk Cay,
the minister in charge of relations with Turkic communities abroad.
``If giving the medal to the Chinese president is in the interest
of Turkey, then we will accept that. We have accepted it. But that
does not mean that we have changed our mind about Eastern
Turkistan. We will convey our message in a friendly atmosphere
during our bilateral meetings.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a speech to a group of writers and performers from eight
Turkic nations on Monday, President Suleyman Demirel did not
mention the Uighurs directly, but he reiterated Turkey's support
for Turkic peoples.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is important is the sense of being Turkic,'' Demirel
said. ``If there are those who cannot say `We are Turks' despite
being Turkic, this is nothing less than a denial of their roots.
After all, what is called the `Turkic world' stretches from the
Adriatic to the Great Wall of China. Both geography and history
show this to be true.''
</P>
<P>
   The Uighur region lies outside the Great Wall.

   MIDEAST-JOURNAL _ BETHLEHEM, West Bank _ Palestinian Jihad
Mubarak was destined to be a fighter in the war against the
Israelis. Instead, he sells them antiques. His uncle, a doctor in
the Jordanian army, delivered him on May 1, 1948, two weeks before
the Arab states attacked the new state of Israel. Name him Jihad,
the uncle ordered. It's Arabic for a Muslim sacred cause or, in
this case, a Holy War. Jihad is an unusual name for a Christian,
but with war coming, it seemed appropriate. But Mubarak, turning 52
this week, has focused his life on beautiful antiques, cars and, he
admits, women. When the 1967 war began and the19-year-old Mubarak
might have fought, the same uncle that delivered him gave a medical
excuse out of the war. Jolly and easy going, the gray-haired
Mubarak sells antiques to Israelis, and has never fought them. His
nondescript store, on the outskirts of Bethlehem, is one of the
most peaceful spots I've found here, a place where Israelis, Arabs
and foreign visitors browse over collectibles from Europe, Syria
and made in Bethlehem. (Kaplow, Cox News Service). 30. WITH PHOTO.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In ``Spoken Soul,'' father and son John and
Russell Rickford render a 267-page analysis of the language of
black folks, now commonly known as Ebonics.
</P>
<P>
   John Rickford, a Stanford University linguist, and Russell
Rickford, a former Philadelphia Inquirer reporter, argue that
spoken soul (a term writer Claude Brown coined in the 1960s) is a
language African Americans should celebrate and proudly claim as
their own, in addition to mastering standard English.
</P>
<P>
   They bolster their argument with a comprehensive examination of
the origins and grammar patterns of black English or as linguists
call it, African American Vernacular English. They delve into the
debate about whether it's a language or dialect and whether it has
connections to West African languages. And they examine the
country's social construct that likely has contributed to the
continued existence of black English.
</P>
<P>
   The Rickfords, who are African American, courageously jump into
the Ebonics controversy that rocked Oakland, Calif., in 1996 when
the school board approved a resolution _ albeit garbled _ that
recognized black English as the home language of African American
students. The resolution called for a curriculum that acknowledged
Ebonics and used it as a starting point to teach standard English
to African American students - most of whom were performing way
below average.
</P>
<P>
   While correcting some of the inaccuracies reported throughout
the ordeal, the Rickfords also critique media coverage of the
issue, blasting print and broadcast journalists and columnists for
their myopia and lack of depth on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   The authors review the history of black English in black
literature, making the point that some of the outrage toward
Oakland's plan came from people who have used Ebonics in their art,
Maya Angelou was one.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the Rickfords present the material in an awkward
order, forcing them to refer to preceding or succeeding pages
mid-sentence. And they spent too little time discussing the effect
of class on the debate of Ebonics' legitimacy that raged, and in
some circles still rages, within the black community. Although,
they do examine briefly some of the social factors that led to the
blind reproach of Oakland's plan in the larger public.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, middle- and upper-class African Americans felt a sense
of embarrassment that white people would believe they, being
educated and professional African Americans, condone the use of
Ebonics, a symbol of poor education and laziness.
</P>
<P>
   The authors adeptly blow this theory out of the water
demonstrating that Ebonics is not corrupted English, but a complex
system of language patterns.
</P>
<P>
   There's a right way to speak Ebonics and a wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   They run down the accepted uses of Ebonics by preachers,
singers, pop artists, rappers, comedians and writers.
</P>
<P>
   Where would Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. be without the
intonations and cadences of spoken soul, they wonder. Ebonics is
the stamp of authenticity of the black experience in the works of
playwright August Wilson, novelists Toni Morrison and Langston
Hughes and poet Paul Lawrence Dunbar.
</P>
<P>
   It's an impressive list of rich works that demonstrates the
hypocrisy of denouncing black English as backwards. Yet as the
Oakland controversy demonstrated, Ebonics in art is much easier to
swallow than the notion that Ebonics is legit enough to use in the
schools.
</P>
<P>
   As advocates for Ebonics, it would have been easy for the
Rickfords to claim West African languages as the sole origin of the
language system. But they take the high road, offering theories
from both sides of the debate among scholars: the Anglicists who
say the grammar, pronunciation and vocabulary of black English
comes from British dialects that blacks might have heard from
English settlers in the 17th and 18th centuries; and the
Africanists who say Ebonics pronunciation and grammar largely rises
from African language systems imposed on an English construct.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Anglicists maintain that the pronunciation of
``th'' as ``t,'' ``d,'' ``f,'' and ``v'' (dem for them or bave for
bathe) comes from British settlers, many of whom were peasants,
speaking nonstandard English. Africanists, however, argue that
because West African languages did not include the ``th'' sound,
Africans in America substituted consonants similar to ``th'' in
their own language, the Rickfords write.
</P>
<P>
   The authors conclude both cultures more than likely influenced
this pronunciation.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Rickfords reveal that Africans in America and
their descendants probably used both British dialects and African
languages, and creole to develop a complex system of grammar,
pronunciation and vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, ``Spoken Soul'' offers insight into the evolution of
Ebonics (Black English, as a living, breathing language, continues
to evolve.) and the debate surrounding it. If the Rickfords aimed
to make readers pause and think about their own reactions to the
language and those who speak it, then they succeeded.

 &HT;    THE ELECTRONIC NOSE IS GROWING FAST
 &HT;    620&AMP;add. For release Sunday, April 23.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON You may say to-MAH-to and I may say to-MAY-to, but
with one quick sniff, the electronic nose can say, ``vine ripened''
or ``picked green.''
</P>
<P>
   Pass the orange juice, and the machine will tell you if it is
fresh-squeezed or made from frozen concentrate.
</P>
<P>
   Sensors on electronic chips can now detect and measure low
levels of the same airborne compounds that activate the natural
sense of smell, without getting tired or distracted or bored or
subjective or revolted, all problems of human and even dog noses.
</P>
<P>
   The very young science of using electronics and computer
programs to detect and recognize signature ``odors'' is maturing
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, electronic noses, which didn't exist until a few
years ago, are about to start showing up all over _ in industry,
food processing, medicine, national security, even in your home.
</P>
<P>
   One ``E-nose'' developer sees his equipment performing such
disparate tasks as:
</P>
<P>
   _ Diagnosing diseases by sniffing a patient's breath.
</P>
<P>
   _ Informing coffee buyers whether the beans in a bag are true
Kona coffee or a Colombian substitute.
</P>
<P>
   _ Making it possible for a microwave oven to know when food is
really done, not just how long it has been in there.
</P>
<P>
   _ Checking dairy cows to make sure they are in heat and ready to
be artificially inseminated. The monitoring task is now performed
by eternally frustrated bulls that, while skillful at assessing a
cow's frame of mind, do not possess the kind of genes available
through artificial breeding.
</P>
<P>
   At a U.S. Department of Agriculture research laboratory at
Athens, Ga., microbiologist Judy Arnold rinses a piece of chicken
and places the tip of a small syringe-like tool over the rinse
water.
</P>
<P>
   In seconds, an electronic nose tells her whether the meat has
been kept refrigerated or has been allowed to warm and then
re-cooled. It also can tell her if disease-causing pathogens such
as salmonella or e.coli are present.
</P>
<P>
   Her work is not aimed at improving the performance of e-noses.
Instead, she is concerned with finding ways to reduce the presence
of pathogens on processed poultry.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't always know the specific compounds that are present
in the odor,'' she said. ``There may be a few, like five or 10, or
there may be 100 or more.''
</P>
<P>
   But the e-nose knows.
</P>
<P>
   At another Agriculture Department lab in Winter Haven, Florida,
a different kind of sniffer not only can tell whether a tomato was
picked ripe or green, but also whether the inside is bruised, even
when damage is not outwardly apparent.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to rapidly assessing the aroma of new varieties of
fruit, the Florida lab uses e-noses to study the way the flavor of
orange juice changes with time.
</P>
<P>
   In one test, the devices correctly distinguished fresh juice
from concentrate mix in 36 of 42 samples, an accuracy of better
than 90 percent, said food chemist Philip E. Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   The artificial noses use a variety of technologies, but in all
of them, the principle is the same. It is based on recent
improvements in the understanding of how natural noses work.
</P>
<P>
   Nerve receptors in the human nose detect volatile airborne
compounds and relay the results to the brain, which analyzes the
manner in which individual receptors are stimulated to identify the
odor.
</P>
<P>
   E-noses consist of arrays of sensors. Contact with a particular
compound may or may not cause an easily measurable change in the
way a given sensor conducts electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Imitating the human nose, e-nose computers analyze the degree to
which various sensors are affected by airborne compounds, and uses
statistical software to recognize specific patterns.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   ``E-nose'' technology originated in Europe in the late 1980s,
said Steven Sunshine, president of Cyrano Sciences, a California
company that takes its name from the fictional Cyrano de Bergerac,
a gallant and brilliant man who was embarrassed by his abnormally
large nose in the 19th century French play by Edmond Rostand.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier sensors were developed around the ability to detect and
respond to a single chemical, Sunshine said. An example is the
sensor in a carbon monoxide detector.
</P>
<P>
   ``As people came to understand the biology of the natural nose,
with a series of sensors and the brain identifying a pattern unique
to a particular smell, they began to say, 'Maybe we can replicate
this process,' `` Sunshine said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   A variety of approaches emerged.
</P>
<P>
   In some sensors, such as the one being used in Athens to check
on the freshness of poultry, the presence of airborne compounds
changes the ability of electricity to flow through metal-oxide
circuits, each tuned to a different group of compounds.
</P>
<P>
   At the Agriculture Department's laboratory in Winter Haven,
individual plastic nodes have been doped with an
electricity-conducting material such as graphite or carbon black.
Electrons move through the nodes at predictable rates. But when the
plastics absorb molecules of a vapor, they swell like sponges and
the spacing between the conductive particles is changed. That
changes the electrical conductivity.
</P>
<P>
   Each node reacts differently to different compounds. The
computer analyzes the differences.
</P>
<P>
   No one expects the electronic sensors to match the range of a
natural nose. A human nose may have a million different receptors,
and the chip in an e-nose may have only a dozen or so. Dogs,
sometimes referred to as ``noses on legs,'' have a hundred million
receptors.
</P>
<P>
   But for specific odors, an array of sensors can be designed that
is more sensitive than human noses. Besides that, e-noses don't
catch colds and don't tire, and nothing smells ``bad'' to them.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is
working to develop an ``electronic dog's nose'' to detect buried
land mines, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
installs odor-sensing equipment in spacecraft to detect such
problems as electrical fires before astronauts would be aware of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine said Cyrano is now accepting orders for its first
commercial product, an $8,000 hand-held device slightly larger than
a cell phone. In place of the stubby antenna on a cell phone, the
Cyranose 320 portable sniffer has a short ``snout'' that draws in
the vapors surrounding a target.
</P>
<P>
   The chip at the center of the Cyranose 320 contains an array of
32 doped plastic dots, each lying along a printed microelectric
circuit. When a dot absorbs a target vapor, it swells, contacts
nearby printed wires and completes the circuit.
</P>
<P>
   The plastic in each dot reacts to a different group of vapors,
and the overall pattern identifies the odor.
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine envisions a time when sales contracts will contain
specifications for specific smells, ensuring that a product such as
coffee or rice is authentic and fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd be surprised what people try to do when the price is
right,'' he said, ``and this technology, with its ability to
digitize smells and detect off-odors, will help control that.''

PROSECUTORS SEEK DEATH PENALTY FOR FORMER PREMIER 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed) 
 By BARRY BEARAK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Pakistani prosecutors demanded the death
penalty Tuesday for Nawaz Sharif, the ousted prime minister,
appealing the life sentence given to him after he was convicted of
hijacking and terrorism on April 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe the judge gave an appropriate explanation for
handing down a lower-than-maximum punishment to Nawaz Sharif,'' the
chief prosecutor, Raja Qureshi, told The Associated Press in
Karachi.
</P>
<P>
   Under Pakistani law, hijacking is a capital offense, though a
judge can give a lesser sentence if circumstances warrant it. After
a criminal trial, the prosecution, like the defense, is entitled to
appeal both the verdict and the sentence to a higher court.
</P>
<P>
   In Judge Rehmetullah Hussein Jaffri's 157-page decision two
weeks ago, he said a life term was sufficient punishment for Sharif
because the hijacking had been ``committed at the spur of the
moment and in heat of passion'' after Sharif ``came to know that
his authority was eroded by some few army soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharif, who was ousted in a nonviolent military coup on Oct. 20,
was convicted of hijacking for temporarily ordering the diversion
of a Karachi-bound commercial plane. Among the 198 people aboard
was a man the prime minister had just fired a few hours before: the
army chief of staff, Gen. Pervez Musharraf.
</P>
<P>
   After the military took command and the general installed
himself as the nation's ``chief executive,'' he told the country
that Sharif and several conspirators had tried to kill him by
ordering the plane out of Pakistani air space when it was short of
fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The judge acquitted six co-defendants but said he considered the
former prime minister guilty of hijacking according to the penal
code's broad definition of that crime, assessing guilt to ``whoever
unlawfully, by the use or show of force or by threats of any kind,
seizes or exercises control of an aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have also appealed the not-guilty verdicts of the
co-defendants, all of whom remain in prison, facing corruption
charges or being held in the limbo of what is known as preventive
detention.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif has also appealed his conviction.
</P>
<P>
   The various appeals will now be reviewed by a panel of the high
court of the province of Sindh.
</P>
<P>
   One of Sharif's lawyers, Khawaja Naveed, told reporters that the
prosecution is demanding a death sentence to make sure the former
prime minister never returns to politics.
</P>
<P>
   Naveed said that if Nelson Mandela, the former South African
president, ``can come to politics after 27 years imprisonment, then
why not Nawaz Sharif?''

   LAMB-FARM (Latrobe, Pa.) _ Among golfers, this town of 10,000
about an hour's drive east of Pittsburgh is known for Arnold
Palmer, who was born here. Among beer drinkers, it is known for
Rolling Rock, the malty lager in the long-neck green bottles, which
is brewed here. Among serious sundae scholars, all three of them,
it is known as the birthplace of the banana split. But among
committed cooks, it is known for Jamison Farm, between Latrobe and
Crabtree, which produces some of the nation's best lamb _ firm yet
tender, younger, paler and tastier than supermarket lamb; with
recipes. By R.W. Apple Jr.

   NY-LINGERING-DINERS (New York) _ Now that ``No Smoking'' and
``No Cell Phones'' icons have become standard signage at New York
restaurants, it may be time for one more admonishment. No
Lingering! The stock market arrows may be pointing down, but
there's still plenty of hungry money out there: demanding diners
and restaurants eager to turn as many tables as possible in a
night. The occasional bum's rush from a white-tablecloth
establishment is not a brand-new phenomenon. But an informal survey
suggests that skirmishes on the contentious border between service
and civility are on the rise.The go-go '00s are no decade for
lingering, especially over dinner. Fortunes are made and lost in
the time it takes to sip a second cappuccino. By Rick Marin.

   FETTISDAGSBULLAR (Undated) _ Spring rolls, Swedish style: The
sweet almond- and cream-filled buns called fettisdagsbullar are
uniquely Scandinavian treats that were traditionally served every
Tuesday from Shrove Tuesday in February until Easter. Their closest
Anglo-Saxon equivalent is the much more modest hot cross bun, which
the English, with their usual reserve, manage to put off eating
until Good Friday. The distinctive essence of fettisdagsbullar,
literally Fat Tuesday buns, derives from cardamom, almond paste,
sugar and whipped cream; with recipe.

   FRESH-HAM (Undated) _ `Fresh ham' is hind leg of pork uncured
and unsmoked. To distinguish it from the cured version, it has come
to be called ``fresh ham,'' and it is a truly wonderful pork roast.

 &UR; FROM: The New York Times Magazine &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Just to the east of the center of London, across the mud-brown
Thames from Parliament, there is a great gray ghost of an office
building. It is almost a century old, and its heavy columns and
doorways and row upon row of unlighted windows extend along the
riverbank for hundreds of yards. From a distance, it might be an
abandoned palace or an emptied party headquarters in Eastern
Europe; up close, there is dust on glass doors and piles of debris
in hallways. Here and there, rooms are occupied: by a shop selling
soccer memorabilia, a Marriott hotel, a busy riverside McDonald's.
But the refurbishments feel thin, temporary. And along two sides of
the building, more carefully drawn than the corporate logos, is a
message from the past in carved gold capital letters. ``County
Hall,'' it reads. ``The Home of London Government From 1922 to
1986.''
</P>
<P>
   County Hall is currently owned by a Japanese leisure and
property company, Shirayama Shokusan. Originally, though, it was
designed to imitate, and rival, the home of Britain's national
government across the water. Then, as now, London was by far the
biggest, most potent and most confident British city. How it was
administered, and by whom, greatly mattered, and every glimpse of
County Hall was to act as a reminder.
</P>
<P>
   During the early 1980s, when the head of the Greater London
Council was a young and irreverent Labor Party radical named Ken
Livingstone, the steeply pitched roof was used, day and night, as a
vast billboard for propaganda against Margaret Thatcher's
Conservative government. One of his more potent devices simply
stated the number of unemployed people in London. From Parliament,
the figures were quite legible.
</P>
<P>
   The British way of politics, however, has limited tolerance for
such independent gestures. In 1986, Thatcher abolished the GLC by
an act of Parliament. County Hall was sold, and Livingstone was
relegated to talk shows and doing voice-overs for commercials. In
1987, he published his autobiography, ``If Voting Changed Anything,
They'd Abolish It.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingstone is 54 now, a creased-looking man of medium height,
with a tendency to slouch and wear beige suits. His eyes are narrow
and watchful. His forehead is furrowed by a life of calculations.
When he speaks, his mouth barely seems to move. But what emerges,
nasal and deadpan in the same droning tone as a thousand London
taxi drivers, is still a sort of political gold.
</P>
<P>
   Livingstone is a left-winger with jokes, a deal maker's
instincts and a seemingly impregnable sense of self-deprecation. In
modern British politics, so dominated by Tony Blair and his sternly
moderate government, such qualities are rare indeed. ``Ken
Livingstone is a unique phenomenon,'' says Prof. Tony Travers of
the London School of Economics. ``A populist far-left-winger with a
constituency that stretches from the young and anarchic to business
leaders.'' And next month, if all goes as expected _ and against
the conventional wisdom of two decades _ Livingstone will again be
running the capital.
</P>
<P>
   On May 4, London is to elect a mayor. From the first poll of the
campaign, ``Ken,'' as he is almost always called, has been the
favorite. No matter that since the GLC, as a Labor member of
Parliament he has been a drifting loner. No matter that his party,
unceasingly, has tried to stop him from becoming a mayoral
candidate: by threats and persuasion, by vicious public criticism,
by electoral machinations and, finally, by expelling him from the
party altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Livingstone is now an independent candidate. He has a bare
skeleton of an electoral machine. His staff is young and sparse.
His campaign headquarters is a single small house with dirty
windows. Until quite recently, it had three phone lines. Yet he has
loomed over almost every day of the contest: smiling mischievously
on his populist trips by bus and subway, delivering his sly
one-liners to the cameras, being featured as graffiti (``Go On
Ken!'') on the walls of pub toilets, being constantly discussed by
the other candidates, being offered back his old office at County
Hall by Shirayama Shokusan, being urged on by pop stars (Fatboy
Slim, Blur and the Chemical Brothers have given very public
support) and artists (Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin, among many
others, have auctioned works on his behalf).
</P>
<P>
   One evening last month, Livingstone appeared with the other
candidates at a debate in north London. South Hampstead, at first
sight, is not the sort of place for political excitement. Its
mansions stand somber and tall on a slope above central London,
fanned by vast old trees. Along its long straight avenues there is
the quiet that money brings. Almost every car is a Mercedes or a
BMW. Yet that evening, in the scrubbed and gleaming gymnasium of a
private girls' school, several hundred local residents in their
shooting jackets and furs had come to sit on plastic chairs and
cheer for socialism.
</P>
<P>
   Their moment arrived soon after 8 o'clock. Two of the minor
candidates had made their pitches, to moderate applause.
Livingstone, seated center-stage, had clapped politely, looked at
the ceiling, yawned. When his turn came, he got to his feet a
little sluggishly. The bright ceiling lights caught the bags under
his eyes, his scuffed brown shoes. His voice was even more nasal
than normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The job of the politician isn't to tell you what you want to
hear,'' he began, ``but to tell you what needs to be done.'' And
for the next five minutes, to great cloudbursts of applause, he
described and justified his plans to raise taxes, very
specifically, on the sort of people in attendance that night.
Londoners who drove from suburbs like South Hampstead into the
center, Livingstone said, would pay a daily 5 pound ``congestion
charge.'' The money would be spent on buses, which were
predominantly used by the poor.
</P>
<P>
   He explained this almost distractedly, without a hint of
salesmanship, in flat, colloquial sentences that struggled at times
to be heard above the murmurs of agreement in the hall. All the
time, he barely moved, except for a few weary circling gestures
with his arms. His jacket hung long and shapeless. It did not quite
match his chinos. He ended with a heresy, made to sound like the
most obvious common sense: ``The great shining lie of British
politics is that you can have good public services without putting
up taxes.'' The crack of palm on palm was thunderous.
</P>
<P>
   London has never had an elected mayor. Until the mid-19th
century, when the sheer sprawl and mess and hazards to health
across its great shallow basin made a single body to oversee
amenities unavoidable, the city did not have a unified government
at all. And since 1986, the capital has again lived in a political
and administrative vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   A patchwork of boroughs and development corporations and
independent enclaves left over from the Middle Ages has looked
after its own interests, loosely overseen by a minor department of
the national government. As a result, some parts of London seem as
neatly governed as Switzerland; others seem to teeter toward chaos.
And all the while, the clotting traffic and choking roadworks and
housing shortages and all the other problems requiring citywide
attention have been left to worsen.
</P>
<P>
   London has always been distrusted by national politicians.
During the civil war of the 1640s, Charles I fled with his court to
Oxford. During the 18th century, the riotous ``London mob''
intimidated Parliament repeatedly. In 1892, an anonymous
conservative pamphlet predicted that the London County Council, the
GLC's predecessor, would raise a private army, abolish the national
government and soon be running the whole country.
</P>
<P>
   The contest for mayor has proved no more controllable. Yet it
seemed a sensible and timely idea when it was proposed, almost
exactly four years ago, by Frank Dobson, a veteran Labor spokesman
who would eventually become the Labor candidate. Labor was
extremely popular, the national government in waiting. One of its
best-received plans was to spread power, at long last, more evenly
across the country: Wales and Scotland were to get parliaments; the
capital would get an elected legislature, the Greater London
Authority, or GLA, and to make this cautious package more enticing,
a mayor. ``There is a sense in which getting a mayor is the
crowning moment for a revived city,'' Travers says.
</P>
<P>
   Or that, at least, has been the theory. In practice, instead of
the quiet, exemplary race Blair wanted _ as good international
publicity for his project of ``modernizing'' Britain and as a model
for choosing mayors in other British cities _ London has put on a
noisy, drawn-out and almost completely unpredictable piece of
political theater.
</P>
<P>
   There have been unwanted candidates. There have been scandalous
withdrawals. There have been disputes over electoral procedures,
public feuds, the flouting of party manifestoes. And infecting it
all has been the giddy sense of an election being fought by untried
and barely understood new rules. For the first time in a big
British election, there have been primaries. In the general
election, voting will be by a volatile, European-style system, with
voters having first and second preferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``This election is a learning process,'' says John Bartle, a
lecturer in British politics at the University of Essex. ``There's
a slight panic.'' Livingstone agrees: ``In a sort of haphazard way,
we are slowly turning ourselves into a modern decentralized
European state.'' To an unprecedented and vivid extent,
personalities have been free to dominate.
</P>
<P>
   Livingstone, famous for keeping newts in his back garden, is
only one of several bizarre candidates who have appeared in the
last year. Glenda Jackson, the former actress, sought the Labor
Party nomination, but came in third in the contest. The
Conservative candidate, Steve Norris, is a former car salesman
notorious for having had five mistresses. He supports gay rights
against his party's wishes. The Labor nominee, Frank Dobson,
refused party advice to shave off his beard, and in March he
referred to Blair's strategists as incompetent ``prats.'' His
campaign before and since, despite being organized by supposedly
the most potent party machine in European politics, has stuttered
and grumbled to a poll rating of barely 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Before settling on Norris, the Conservatives first nominated
Jeffrey Archer, the millionaire writer of melodramatic novels.
Then, when an ancient deceit of his involving a prostitute came to
light, he was dropped. Norris, whom Archer had beat to the
nomination, tried once more. But a group of influential
Conservative women, appalled at Norris' insouciance about his
personal life _ his tabloid nickname, which he makes little effort
to play down, is Shagger _ had his candidacy halted. A curious
lineup of alternatives emerged, including a baroness remembered for
once leaning on a light switch during a speech by Thatcher and a
local councilor whose uncle was a wrestling dwarf. Norris was
reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   Another strange hopeful has been Malcolm McLaren, the former
manager of the Sex Pistols. He ran briefly as an independent, hair
still as flaming as his rhetoric, advocating ``a more earthy
political era.'' Then, last month in South Hampstead, right after
Livingstone had finished speaking, McLaren stood up in a green
tweed suit of some flamboyance and announced he was giving up. ``I
don't really want any politician for a mayor,'' he said, ``But if I
have to have one, please let it be Ken Livingstone.''
</P>
<P>
   The more Labor has sought to block and batter Livingstone, the
more popular he has emerged. In January, Gordon Brown, the
chancellor of the exchequer, and Blair himself addressed a meeting
of the London Labor Party about the dangers of choosing the
``extremist'' Livingstone as candidate for mayor. The boos could be
heard on the radio. In February, Dobson was nominated as the Labor
candidate after winning barely a third of his local party members'
votes _ Livingstone won the rest _ thanks to an electoral system
that was widely described as ``North Korean.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingstone has remained smirkingly calm throughout. Even on a
freezing street corner, with winter blowing in again down Tottenham
Court Road and the central London traffic roaring past and his
cheeks pink with talking and the cold. Behind him looms his first
campaign poster, just unveiled. ``You Can't Save the Underground by
Taking the Party Line,'' it reads, highlighting his two favorite
themes: his independence and his scheme to repair the tube by
issuing bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very confident that the government's existing plan can be
overturned,'' he says. His mouth crinkles a little, defiantly.
``Any system that is bad for Londoners will be open to judicial
review in the courts.'' Why does he concentrate so much on
transport? ``Most of the mayor's powers are on transport.'' Does he
expect those powers to expand? His eyes flick up. ``I think it's
inevitable, with the mandate the mayor will have, that they will do
more than people expect now.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping his hands deep in his coat pockets and without raising
his voice at all, he begins to list policies. ``I'm also demanding
that we get back the police we've lost. ... The mayor's got to get
back from the national government the money that we pump into it.
London contributes 19 billion pounds more than it receives. ... And
the mayor's going to have to advocate tolerance. One of the reasons
that we've got openly gay government ministers now is that the GLC
stood up for tolerance 16 years ago.'' Isn't all this a bit
ambitious? ``If I can't make a difference, I shouldn't get
re-elected.''
</P>
<P>
   But can he? For a few weeks earlier this winter, in the lobby of
the Museum of London, there was a small exhibition that suggested
otherwise. It was called ``Message to the Mayor,'' and it included
scale models and magnified diagrams from previous vain efforts to
rationalize the capital. There was the Abercrombie Plan of 1943,
which proposed dividing the city into zones for different
activities, linked up by huge new roads. Its maps were almost
beautiful, all arching black lines and amoebalike colored circles,
but as realistic as children's drawings. Elsewhere, there were the
fragmentary remains of other grand designs: the Greater London
Development Plan (1969), six failed schemes for Piccadilly Circus
(1958-71) and a proposal called ``Towards an Urban Renaissance''
(1999).
</P>
<P>
   Outside, around the circular site of the museum, the early
afternoon traffic was already coiling and tightening. Opposite, an
enormous builders' scaffolding was swamping a sidewalk. Beyond it,
the long smooth precincts of the Barbican Center, London's last big
piece of civic self-improvement, were, as usual, almost deserted.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will have to learn what a mayor can and can't do,''
Bartle says. And it is unlikely that measurable improvements to the
capital will be quick to arrive. The newest subway line, for
example, took more than a decade to complete. Yet expectations,
stirred by the campaign, and the probable intensity of interest in
the first mayor's activities may ignore such practicalities. ``Each
time a bus is late, the mayor will lose votes,'' says Travers.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor is to stand for re-election every four years.
Livingstone, though, knows these pressures better than the other
candidates. In the five years that he headed the GLC, his
popularity swung wildly. At the start, he was widely considered a
chilly extremist. He lived in an ascetic, one-room apartment,
talked a bit like a Marxist and was accused of supporting
Republican terrorists in Northern Ireland. But once ``the commissar
of County Hall'' began to appear on television _ and the
invitations were not slow in coming _ his rumpled, droll persona
eroded such stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   Red Ken, as he became slightly more affectionately known, liked
his newts and gossiping in smart restaurants. He was part
cartoonish city boss, part English eccentric. And some of his
policies _ in particular Fares Fair, which cut the price of tickets
on public transport by a third _ were expertly publicized,
effective and eventually popular. For the first time, before or
since, many thousands of Londoners stopped crawling to work by car.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Thatcher, as Blair has done since, identified a threat.
Livingstone, with the capital as a base, with the country's largest
electorate and a London-obsessed press, could destabilize British
politics. He was sufficiently ambitious: he wooed the middle
classes, he realized the importance of presentational ``style'' and
effective political advertising, he appealed to environmentalists
and, to his political credit ever since, the minority voters who
now make up almost a third of London's electorate. All of these
notions, in Britain in the early '80s, were substantially ahead of
their time. Blair himself, who was just starting out in Labor
politics, was groping toward similar conclusions from a less
left-wing starting point.
</P>
<P>
   And nowadays, with the government enduring its first period of
fierce criticism and self-doubt _ for being too controlling and not
left-wing enough, in the capital and beyond _ Livingstone is,
perhaps, even more beguiling than before. Conservatives, who used
to find Livingstone infuriating, may now vote for him simply for
defying Blair. Liberals, who used to think Livingstone slippery and
vain, now admire his capacity for reinvention and survival. And
Londoners generally, dismayed at the state of public amenities, may
well be in the mood for left-wing municipal gestures.
</P>
<P>
   Early in February, in a very different suburb from South
Hampstead, I heard Livingstone speak in another gymnasium. It was
in Orpington, a long finger of public housing groping for the
countryside beyond southeast London. The room was smaller and
dirtier and full of Labor Party members, almost all pensioners.
Livingstone gave a performance of pure nostalgia. He called the
audience ``comrades.''
</P>
<P>
   He talked about putting conductors back on London buses and
guards back on the subway trains. He would persuade ``city gents in
their pin stripes'' to use public transport, just like ``when I
first started going to work in 1962.'' He lingered on his ``safe''
London childhood, about going to the zoo without an adult _
``that's what we have to get back.'' For an hour and a half, as the
wet evening misted the windows, a fantasy London of old-fashioned
neighborliness and order formed from his Cockney vowels.
</P>
<P>
   The public is much fonder of Livingstone than are many who have
worked with him. Few former members of the GLC or London Labor MPs
or heads of the city's boroughs have publicly supported his mayoral
bid. ``The problem with Ken,'' says Clive Soley, the chairman of
the Parliamentary Labor Party and one of Livingstone's more
thoughtful critics, ``is that he's an individualist.'' For example,
Soley adds, Livingstone's strong views on Northern Ireland would
have made him a useful member of the parliamentary select committee
on the subject. ``But he was never there. He was not there during
the peace process. He is not a team player.'' In his autobiography,
Livingstone praises the novel ``The Godfather'' as providing an
``honest account of how politicians operate.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the parliamentary standards committee announced that
Livingstone had violated regulations by failing to report $251,221
of outside income. The charge was a common and relatively minor one
_ MPs are notoriously lax about listing outside enterprises. But
the sources of Livingstone's income looked slightly suspect for a
declared socialist: $58,458 for after-dinner speeches to
businessmen and $52,272 for reviewing restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, his precise politics have blurred somewhat with the
years. At times, he promises a mayoralty like his GLC days,
confronting corporations he dislikes, sacking ``the racist and
corrupt minority'' in London's police and making the capital kinder
to its poor and disadvantaged. In other speeches, he offers to form
alliances with Conservatives and to run London like a pure
pragmatist. Most likely, if Livingstone wins _ and his poll lead
currently is, as it has been for months, a scarcely believable 40
percentage points _ he will govern more radically than Blair would
like but less radically than his most excited supporters are
currently imagining.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Party, for all its public assaults on him, is already
privately preparing for life with Livingstone. Party members who
support his independent candidacy will not be purged, as
regulations say they should be. He, in turn, has avoided directly
criticizing Blair. The mayor, whoever it is, will have to work with
the 25-member Greater London Authority, which is likely to have a
large Labor element. And in the gymnasium in South Hampstead, near
the end of the evening, there was a tiny hint that a Livingstone
mayoralty might, at least occasionally, be friendly to the national
government.
</P>
<P>
   Someone had asked him a question about the euro. As mayor of a
major financial capital, would he favor Britain's joining Europe's
single currency? Livingstone laid out his view, which is cautiously
pro-euro _ little different from that of the government. Of course,
he added, it wasn't certain that Britain would join the single
currency under Labor. ``I don't think it's guaranteed,'' he said,
``that we will even win the next national election.''
</P>
<P>
   A few in the audience noticed the slip. ``He said 'we' meaning
the Labor Party,'' someone half-whispered near the front. Perhaps
Livingstone heard. He sat down, after he finished speaking, behind
a paper sign that read, ``Livingstone: INDEPENDENT,'' with his
mouth fixed, unusually, in a slight frown. For a moment, being
mayor looked like less of an adventure.

<P>
   Just to the east of the center of London, across the mud-brown
Thames from Parliament, there is a great gray ghost of an office
building. It is almost a century old, and its heavy columns and
doorways and row upon row of unlighted windows extend along the
riverbank for hundreds of yards. From a distance, it might be an
abandoned palace or an emptied party headquarters in Eastern
Europe; up close, there is dust on glass doors and piles of debris
in hallways. Here and there, rooms are occupied: by a shop selling
soccer memorabilia, a Marriott hotel, a busy riverside McDonald's.
But the refurbishments feel thin, temporary. And along two sides of
the building, more carefully drawn than the corporate logos, is a
message from the past in carved gold capital letters. ``County
Hall,'' it reads. ``The Home of London Government From 1922 to
1986.''
</P>
<P>
   County Hall is currently owned by a Japanese leisure and
property company, Shirayama Shokusan. Originally, though, it was
designed to imitate, and rival, the home of Britain's national
government across the water. Then, as now, London was by far the
biggest, most potent and most confident British city. How it was
administered, and by whom, greatly mattered, and every glimpse of
County Hall was to act as a reminder.
</P>
<P>
   During the early 1980s, when the head of the Greater London
Council was a young and irreverent Labor Party radical named Ken
Livingstone, the steeply pitched roof was used, day and night, as a
vast billboard for propaganda against Margaret Thatcher's
Conservative government. One of his more potent devices simply
stated the number of unemployed people in London. From Parliament,
the figures were quite legible.
</P>
<P>
   The British way of politics, however, has limited tolerance for
such independent gestures. In 1986, Thatcher abolished the GLC by
an act of Parliament. County Hall was sold, and Livingstone was
relegated to talk shows and doing voice-overs for commercials. In
1987, he published his autobiography, ``If Voting Changed Anything,
They'd Abolish It.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingstone is 54 now, a creased-looking man of medium height,
with a tendency to slouch and wear beige suits. His eyes are narrow
and watchful. His forehead is furrowed by a life of calculations.
When he speaks, his mouth barely seems to move. But what emerges,
nasal and deadpan in the same droning tone as a thousand London
taxi drivers, is still a sort of political gold.
</P>
<P>
   Livingstone is a left-winger with jokes, a deal maker's
instincts and a seemingly impregnable sense of self-deprecation. In
modern British politics, so dominated by Tony Blair and his sternly
moderate government, such qualities are rare indeed. ``Ken
Livingstone is a unique phenomenon,'' says Prof. Tony Travers of
the London School of Economics. ``A populist far-left-winger with a
constituency that stretches from the young and anarchic to business
leaders.'' And next month, if all goes as expected _ and against
the conventional wisdom of two decades _ Livingstone will again be
running the capital.
</P>
<P>
   On May 4, London is to elect a mayor. From the first poll of the
campaign, ``Ken,'' as he is almost always called, has been the
favorite. No matter that since the GLC, as a Labor member of
Parliament he has been a drifting loner. No matter that his party,
unceasingly, has tried to stop him from becoming a mayoral
candidate: by threats and persuasion, by vicious public criticism,
by electoral machinations and, finally, by expelling him from the
party altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Livingstone is now an independent candidate. He has a bare
skeleton of an electoral machine. His staff is young and sparse.
His campaign headquarters is a single small house with dirty
windows. Until quite recently, it had three phone lines. Yet he has
loomed over almost every day of the contest: smiling mischievously
on his populist trips by bus and subway, delivering his sly
one-liners to the cameras, being featured as graffiti (``Go On
Ken!'') on the walls of pub toilets, being constantly discussed by
the other candidates, being offered back his old office at County
Hall by Shirayama Shokusan, being urged on by pop stars (Fatboy
Slim, Blur and the Chemical Brothers have given very public
support) and artists (Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin, among many
others, have auctioned works on his behalf).
</P>
<P>
   One evening last month, Livingstone appeared with the other
candidates at a debate in north London. South Hampstead, at first
sight, is not the sort of place for political excitement. Its
mansions stand somber and tall on a slope above central London,
fanned by vast old trees. Along its long straight avenues there is
the quiet that money brings. Almost every car is a Mercedes or a
BMW. Yet that evening, in the scrubbed and gleaming gymnasium of a
private girls' school, several hundred local residents in their
shooting jackets and furs had come to sit on plastic chairs and
cheer for socialism.
</P>
<P>
   Their moment arrived soon after 8 o'clock. Two of the minor
candidates had made their pitches, to moderate applause.
Livingstone, seated center-stage, had clapped politely, looked at
the ceiling, yawned. When his turn came, he got to his feet a
little sluggishly. The bright ceiling lights caught the bags under
his eyes, his scuffed brown shoes. His voice was even more nasal
than normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The job of the politician isn't to tell you what you want to
hear,'' he began, ``but to tell you what needs to be done.'' And
for the next five minutes, to great cloudbursts of applause, he
described and justified his plans to raise taxes, very
specifically, on the sort of people in attendance that night.
Londoners who drove from suburbs like South Hampstead into the
center, Livingstone said, would pay a daily 5 pound ``congestion
charge.'' The money would be spent on buses, which were
predominantly used by the poor.
</P>
<P>
   He explained this almost distractedly, without a hint of
salesmanship, in flat, colloquial sentences that struggled at times
to be heard above the murmurs of agreement in the hall. All the
time, he barely moved, except for a few weary circling gestures
with his arms. His jacket hung long and shapeless. It did not quite
match his chinos. He ended with a heresy, made to sound like the
most obvious common sense: ``The great shining lie of British
politics is that you can have good public services without putting
up taxes.'' The crack of palm on palm was thunderous.
</P>
<P>
   London has never had an elected mayor. Until the mid-19th
century, when the sheer sprawl and mess and hazards to health
across its great shallow basin made a single body to oversee
amenities unavoidable, the city did not have a unified government
at all. And since 1986, the capital has again lived in a political
and administrative vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   A patchwork of boroughs and development corporations and
independent enclaves left over from the Middle Ages has looked
after its own interests, loosely overseen by a minor department of
the national government. As a result, some parts of London seem as
neatly governed as Switzerland; others seem to teeter toward chaos.
And all the while, the clotting traffic and choking roadworks and
housing shortages and all the other problems requiring citywide
attention have been left to worsen.
</P>
<P>
   London has always been distrusted by national politicians.
During the civil war of the 1640s, Charles I fled with his court to
Oxford. During the 18th century, the riotous ``London mob''
intimidated Parliament repeatedly. In 1892, an anonymous
conservative pamphlet predicted that the London County Council, the
GLC's predecessor, would raise a private army, abolish the national
government and soon be running the whole country.
</P>
<P>
   The contest for mayor has proved no more controllable. Yet it
seemed a sensible and timely idea when it was proposed, almost
exactly four years ago, by Frank Dobson, a veteran Labor spokesman
who would eventually become the Labor candidate. Labor was
extremely popular, the national government in waiting. One of its
best-received plans was to spread power, at long last, more evenly
across the country: Wales and Scotland were to get parliaments; the
capital would get an elected legislature, the Greater London
Authority, or GLA, and to make this cautious package more enticing,
a mayor. ``There is a sense in which getting a mayor is the
crowning moment for a revived city,'' Travers says.
</P>
<P>
   Or that, at least, has been the theory. In practice, instead of
the quiet, exemplary race Blair wanted _ as good international
publicity for his project of ``modernizing'' Britain and as a model
for choosing mayors in other British cities _ London has put on a
noisy, drawn-out and almost completely unpredictable piece of
political theater.
</P>
<P>
   There have been unwanted candidates. There have been scandalous
withdrawals. There have been disputes over electoral procedures,
public feuds, the flouting of party manifestoes. And infecting it
all has been the giddy sense of an election being fought by untried
and barely understood new rules. For the first time in a big
British election, there have been primaries. In the general
election, voting will be by a volatile, European-style system, with
voters having first and second preferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``This election is a learning process,'' says John Bartle, a
lecturer in British politics at the University of Essex. ``There's
a slight panic.'' Livingstone agrees: ``In a sort of haphazard way,
we are slowly turning ourselves into a modern decentralized
European state.'' To an unprecedented and vivid extent,
personalities have been free to dominate.
</P>
<P>
   Livingstone, famous for keeping newts in his back garden, is
only one of several bizarre candidates who have appeared in the
last year. Glenda Jackson, the former actress, sought the Labor
Party nomination, but came in third in the contest. The
Conservative candidate, Steve Norris, is a former car salesman
notorious for having had five mistresses. He supports gay rights
against his party's wishes. The Labor nominee, Frank Dobson,
refused party advice to shave off his beard, and in March he
referred to Blair's strategists as incompetent ``prats.'' His
campaign before and since, despite being organized by supposedly
the most potent party machine in European politics, has stuttered
and grumbled to a poll rating of barely 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Before settling on Norris, the Conservatives first nominated
Jeffrey Archer, the millionaire writer of melodramatic novels.
Then, when an ancient deceit of his involving a prostitute came to
light, he was dropped. Norris, whom Archer had beat to the
nomination, tried once more. But a group of influential
Conservative women, appalled at Norris' insouciance about his
personal life _ his tabloid nickname, which he makes little effort
to play down, is Shagger _ had his candidacy halted. A curious
lineup of alternatives emerged, including a baroness remembered for
once leaning on a light switch during a speech by Thatcher and a
local councilor whose uncle was a wrestling dwarf. Norris was
reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   Another strange hopeful has been Malcolm McLaren, the former
manager of the Sex Pistols. He ran briefly as an independent, hair
still as flaming as his rhetoric, advocating ``a more earthy
political era.'' Then, last month in South Hampstead, right after
Livingstone had finished speaking, McLaren stood up in a green
tweed suit of some flamboyance and announced he was giving up. ``I
don't really want any politician for a mayor,'' he said, ``But if I
have to have one, please let it be Ken Livingstone.''
</P>
<P>
   The more Labor has sought to block and batter Livingstone, the
more popular he has emerged. In January, Gordon Brown, the
chancellor of the exchequer, and Blair himself addressed a meeting
of the London Labor Party about the dangers of choosing the
``extremist'' Livingstone as candidate for mayor. The boos could be
heard on the radio. In February, Dobson was nominated as the Labor
candidate after winning barely a third of his local party members'
votes _ Livingstone won the rest _ thanks to an electoral system
that was widely described as ``North Korean.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingstone has remained smirkingly calm throughout. Even on a
freezing street corner, with winter blowing in again down Tottenham
Court Road and the central London traffic roaring past and his
cheeks pink with talking and the cold. Behind him looms his first
campaign poster, just unveiled. ``You Can't Save the Underground by
Taking the Party Line,'' it reads, highlighting his two favorite
themes: his independence and his scheme to repair the tube by
issuing bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very confident that the government's existing plan can be
overturned,'' he says. His mouth crinkles a little, defiantly.
``Any system that is bad for Londoners will be open to judicial
review in the courts.'' Why does he concentrate so much on
transport? ``Most of the mayor's powers are on transport.'' Does he
expect those powers to expand? His eyes flick up. ``I think it's
inevitable, with the mandate the mayor will have, that they will do
more than people expect now.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping his hands deep in his coat pockets and without raising
his voice at all, he begins to list policies. ``I'm also demanding
that we get back the police we've lost. ... The mayor's got to get
back from the national government the money that we pump into it.
London contributes 19 billion pounds more than it receives. ... And
the mayor's going to have to advocate tolerance. One of the reasons
that we've got openly gay government ministers now is that the GLC
stood up for tolerance 16 years ago.'' Isn't all this a bit
ambitious? ``If I can't make a difference, I shouldn't get
re-elected.''
</P>
<P>
   But can he? For a few weeks earlier this winter, in the lobby of
the Museum of London, there was a small exhibition that suggested
otherwise. It was called ``Message to the Mayor,'' and it included
scale models and magnified diagrams from previous vain efforts to
rationalize the capital. There was the Abercrombie Plan of 1943,
which proposed dividing the city into zones for different
activities, linked up by huge new roads. Its maps were almost
beautiful, all arching black lines and amoebalike colored circles,
but as realistic as children's drawings. Elsewhere, there were the
fragmentary remains of other grand designs: the Greater London
Development Plan (1969), six failed schemes for Piccadilly Circus
(1958-71) and a proposal called ``Towards an Urban Renaissance''
(1999).
</P>
<P>
   Outside, around the circular site of the museum, the early
afternoon traffic was already coiling and tightening. Opposite, an
enormous builders' scaffolding was swamping a sidewalk. Beyond it,
the long smooth precincts of the Barbican Center, London's last big
piece of civic self-improvement, were, as usual, almost deserted.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will have to learn what a mayor can and can't do,''
Bartle says. And it is unlikely that measurable improvements to the
capital will be quick to arrive. The newest subway line, for
example, took more than a decade to complete. Yet expectations,
stirred by the campaign, and the probable intensity of interest in
the first mayor's activities may ignore such practicalities. ``Each
time a bus is late, the mayor will lose votes,'' says Travers.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor is to stand for re-election every four years.
Livingstone, though, knows these pressures better than the other
candidates. In the five years that he headed the GLC, his
popularity swung wildly. At the start, he was widely considered a
chilly extremist. He lived in an ascetic, one-room apartment,
talked a bit like a Marxist and was accused of supporting
Republican terrorists in Northern Ireland. But once ``the commissar
of County Hall'' began to appear on television _ and the
invitations were not slow in coming _ his rumpled, droll persona
eroded such stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   Red Ken, as he became slightly more affectionately known, liked
his newts and gossiping in smart restaurants. He was part
cartoonish city boss, part English eccentric. And some of his
policies _ in particular Fares Fair, which cut the price of tickets
on public transport by a third _ were expertly publicized,
effective and eventually popular. For the first time, before or
since, many thousands of Londoners stopped crawling to work by car.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Thatcher, as Blair has done since, identified a threat.
Livingstone, with the capital as a base, with the country's largest
electorate and a London-obsessed press, could destabilize British
politics. He was sufficiently ambitious: he wooed the middle
classes, he realized the importance of presentational ``style'' and
effective political advertising, he appealed to environmentalists
and, to his political credit ever since, the minority voters who
now make up almost a third of London's electorate. All of these
notions, in Britain in the early '80s, were substantially ahead of
their time. Blair himself, who was just starting out in Labor
politics, was groping toward similar conclusions from a less
left-wing starting point.
</P>
<P>
   And nowadays, with the government enduring its first period of
fierce criticism and self-doubt _ for being too controlling and not
left-wing enough, in the capital and beyond _ Livingstone is,
perhaps, even more beguiling than before. Conservatives, who used
to find Livingstone infuriating, may now vote for him simply for
defying Blair. Liberals, who used to think Livingstone slippery and
vain, now admire his capacity for reinvention and survival. And
Londoners generally, dismayed at the state of public amenities, may
well be in the mood for left-wing municipal gestures.
</P>
<P>
   Early in February, in a very different suburb from South
Hampstead, I heard Livingstone speak in another gymnasium. It was
in Orpington, a long finger of public housing groping for the
countryside beyond southeast London. The room was smaller and
dirtier and full of Labor Party members, almost all pensioners.
Livingstone gave a performance of pure nostalgia. He called the
audience ``comrades.''
</P>
<P>
   He talked about putting conductors back on London buses and
guards back on the subway trains. He would persuade ``city gents in
their pin stripes'' to use public transport, just like ``when I
first started going to work in 1962.'' He lingered on his ``safe''
London childhood, about going to the zoo without an adult _
``that's what we have to get back.'' For an hour and a half, as the
wet evening misted the windows, a fantasy London of old-fashioned
neighborliness and order formed from his Cockney vowels.
</P>
<P>
   The public is much fonder of Livingstone than are many who have
worked with him. Few former members of the GLC or London Labor MPs
or heads of the city's boroughs have publicly supported his mayoral
bid. ``The problem with Ken,'' says Clive Soley, the chairman of
the Parliamentary Labor Party and one of Livingstone's more
thoughtful critics, ``is that he's an individualist.'' For example,
Soley adds, Livingstone's strong views on Northern Ireland would
have made him a useful member of the parliamentary select committee
on the subject. ``But he was never there. He was not there during
the peace process. He is not a team player.'' In his autobiography,
Livingstone praises the novel ``The Godfather'' as providing an
``honest account of how politicians operate.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the parliamentary standards committee announced that
Livingstone had violated regulations by failing to report $251,221
of outside income. The charge was a common and relatively minor one
_ MPs are notoriously lax about listing outside enterprises. But
the sources of Livingstone's income looked slightly suspect for a
declared socialist: $58,458 for after-dinner speeches to
businessmen and $52,272 for reviewing restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, his precise politics have blurred somewhat with the
years. At times, he promises a mayoralty like his GLC days,
confronting corporations he dislikes, sacking ``the racist and
corrupt minority'' in London's police and making the capital kinder
to its poor and disadvantaged. In other speeches, he offers to form
alliances with Conservatives and to run London like a pure
pragmatist. Most likely, if Livingstone wins _ and his poll lead
currently is, as it has been for months, a scarcely believable 40
percentage points _ he will govern more radically than Blair would
like but less radically than his most excited supporters are
currently imagining.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Party, for all its public assaults on him, is already
privately preparing for life with Livingstone. Party members who
support his independent candidacy will not be purged, as
regulations say they should be. He, in turn, has avoided directly
criticizing Blair. The mayor, whoever it is, will have to work with
the 25-member Greater London Authority, which is likely to have a
large Labor element. And in the gymnasium in South Hampstead, near
the end of the evening, there was a tiny hint that a Livingstone
mayoralty might, at least occasionally, be friendly to the national
government.
</P>
<P>
   Someone had asked him a question about the euro. As mayor of a
major financial capital, would he favor Britain's joining Europe's
single currency? Livingstone laid out his view, which is cautiously
pro-euro _ little different from that of the government. Of course,
he added, it wasn't certain that Britain would join the single
currency under Labor. ``I don't think it's guaranteed,'' he said,
``that we will even win the next national election.''
</P>
<P>
   A few in the audience noticed the slip. ``He said 'we' meaning
the Labor Party,'' someone half-whispered near the front. Perhaps
Livingstone heard. He sat down, after he finished speaking, behind
a paper sign that read, ``Livingstone: INDEPENDENT,'' with his
mouth fixed, unusually, in a slight frown. For a moment, being
mayor looked like less of an adventure.

&HT;     A CONTROVERSIAL PLAN ON BAY-AREA DOT-COM GROWTH 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RACHEL GORDON  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A new plan to give the cramped dot-com industry
more space to grow in San Francisco has ignited a long-simmering
battle over the city's development, pitting the entrepreneurs of
high-tech against the advocates of slow growth.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Leslie Katz on Monday introduced the first in a
series of proposed regulations for e-firms, the fastest-growing
segment of the city's red-hot economy.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, the multimedia companies have created an
estimated 55,000 jobs, many in the South of Market and Mission
districts, bringing new opportunities and new worries to those
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, high-tech firms would get their own zoning
designation _ ``research, development and technology business
service use'' _ separating them from the more traditional office
space, research and development and light-industry categories they
have fallen under.
</P>
<P>
   By carving out a special niche for the high-tech enterprises,
Katz hopes to accomplish two goals:
</P>
<P>
   _ Make them pump more money into the city's affordable-housing
fund than under their current designations.
</P>
<P>
   _ Exempt them from the city's long-standing cap on new
development. That idea, the most explosive component of the
package, is being drafted and Katz said she plans to present it
soon.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition M, which local voters approved in 1986, limits new
office development to 875,000 square feet annually. In some years,
when the economy slacked, not all the allotment was used, and the
leftover square footage could be rolled over into subsequent years.
</P>
<P>
   The pot grew to 2.3 million square feet for use this year, but
it is quickly being depleted in a building boom not seen in the
city for decades. Planning Director Gerald Green said the cap might
be reached by June.
</P>
<P>
   Katz said that worried businesses, particularly those involved
with dot-coms.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're nervous because we have tremendous opportunity to stay
on the cutting edge _ the biggest obstacle now is lack of space,''
said Katz.
</P>
<P>
   But Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano is opposed to
giving special development considerations to the new industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main concern about Supervisor Katz's proposal is that
increasing affordable housing fees for multimedia is not an
appropriate quid pro quo for circumventing the will of the
voters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano has joined forces with a coalition of community groups
that have come out strongly against the Katz plan.
</P>
<P>
   Community activists already have threatened to go to the ballot
to stop the Prop. M exemption should the board approve the
legislation. Mayor Willie Brown, meanwhile, backs Katz's efforts
regarding new construction.
</P>
<P>
   Katz said critics didn't have all the facts about what her
legislative package was striving to do. She said she wanted the
Planning Commission to create special zones where the dot-com
industry would be locked out. In addition, she wants a ban on the
destruction of housing to make way for a high-tech firm.
</P>
<P>
   Other proposals call for setting height limits on the new
projects and getting developers to pay relocation fees for existing
displaced businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's proposal also would force research, development and
technology companies to either provide on-site childcare or pay
into a special child care fund at the rate of $1 per square foot of
development.

<P>
   Fanny Kemble wrote a memoir about life in slave-era Georgia
that, when published in her native England, was credited with
convincing Parliament to withdraw loans to the Confederacy, which
in turn weakened the war effort in the clash between the North and
South. On the other hand, in ``Enslavement: The True Story of Fanny
Kemble,'' she spouts such balderdash as ``No one can paint me as I
am because I am not what I appear to be'' and ``I am sick to death
of being Fanny Kemble but I'm so good at it, I can't do anything
else'' _ in the film's first six minutes. So you're not really
inclined to think very well of her, regardless of the historical
record.
</P>
<P>
   And one suspects that Jane Seymour, who stars as Kemble and
serves as executive producer of ``Enslavement,'' really didn't have
anything powerful or persuasive or interesting to say about
slavery, she just wanted to be heroic while parading around in some
really elegant gowns. And so she does, after winning the heart of a
wealthy landowner named Pierce Butler (Keith Carradine), who tells
her, ``I would never attempt to restrict you;'' but of course,
after the requisite love scene, he's doing precisely that not five
minutes later in the film. The rest of the movie is just as subtle.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Sally Hemings: An American Scandal,'' which aired on CBS
two months back, ``Enslavement'' can't decide whether it's a story
about race or just a standard-issue bodice-ripper; unlike
``Hemings,'' it's more at home as the latter. Director James Keach,
Seymour's husband, gives himself the role of a simpering yet heroic
doctor who chases Fanny; he also opens the movie with an
exploitative and otherwise unrelated scene straight out of
``Mandingo'' of semi-nude slaves brutalized for engaging in a
romantic coupling.
</P>
<P>
   He also bathes his wife in so much soft focus the whole movie
feels fuzzy. Though the film spans 20 years and Fanny was in her
50s during the Civil War, Seymour _ whose British accent sounds
like the result of watching an hour or two of ``Masterpiece
Theatre'' _ doesn't seem to age a day. Sitting through this,
however, will most definitely impress upon you the ravages of time.

   ``The Miracle Maker'' brings us the Life of Christ in the same
medium that transformed Gumby into a children's icon, Claymation,
mixed intermittently (and irritably) with inferior other styles
(probably farmed out to other animators in order to meet some
deadline or budgetary constraint).
</P>
<P>
   The cast of voices _ led by Ralph Fiennes as Jesus, and
including Julie Christie (playing Mary Magdelene, who's not a
prostitute here, just a little crazy), William Hurt (who, even
though his mug's nowhere in sight, !ital!still!off manages to
overact), Ian Holm, Richard E. Grant and so on _ underscores the
intended level of reverence surrounding this project. And at times,
the tableaux created are visually impressive. Particularly the
crucifixion, but then, every filmmaker tends to do a good job with
the crucifixion; if you can't make that stirring, you don't belong
in the business.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the story is delivered with a reverence
bordering on bloodlessness; kids may enjoy the animation, but
there's nothing that fresh here that parents haven't sat through
countless times before. One imagines the brainstorming session:
``How !ital!hasn't the story of Jesus been told?'' Stay tuned for
next year's sock-puppet version; it really couldn't be any
kitschier than this.

 &HT;    FOREIGN JOURNAL: PEACE THROUGH ANTIQUES _ JIHAD HAS A DEAL FOR
YOU
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHLEHEM, West Bank When I ask how he got his name, antiques
dealer Jihad Mubarak sits back on his Syrian, mother-of-pearl
chairs and flashes one of his wide smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born May 1, 1948,'' he began.
</P>
<P>
   That was just days before the Arab nations attacked Israel in an
attempt to crush its bid for statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak's uncle was a doctor in the Jordanian army and delivered
the boy. ``He has to be named 'Jihad,''' the uncle insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, ``Jihad'' is a Muslim name. It can mean a holy struggle
_ such as in Iran where a ``Construction Jihad,'' exhorts people to
donate time to public works.
</P>
<P>
   In Jihad's case, it was probably imbued with the other meaning,
``holy war'' against Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly three years in the Middle East, I'm used to seeing
people trapped in the past, living out bitter destinies set down
for them by their ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Jihad Mubarak is not one of them. Despite his name,
his attentions have focused on motorcycles, old furniture and old
cars.
</P>
<P>
   Now, instead of fighting a jihad against Israelis, he sells
antiques to them _ along with Arabs, Europeans and Americans.
</P>
<P>
   This is far from the only case of cross-cultural commerce here.
Even while Israelis and Palestinians engage in angry rhetoric _
especially from the Palestinian side _ Israelis more and more are
frequenting Arab shops and markets. And, tens of thousands of
Palestinians go to work every day in the employment of Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak's shop, a converted old block house, is one of the more
peaceful places I've found. I've bought a few pieces myself, but go
more often to browse and sip tea.
</P>
<P>
   Downstairs is the workshop, where workers refurbish the pieces
Mubarak buys from Palestinians in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs are two small showrooms and a patio where customers can
look over furniture before a backdrop of olive groves and
stone-terraced hillsides.
</P>
<P>
   You can browse through the old English desk with the hidden
drawers or the Byzantine-style church icons. He has a few old photo
portraits from the American Civil War, a five-foot-tall throne-like
English armchair, and a Syrian gaming table for chess, backgammon
and cards.
</P>
<P>
   He's got heavy old iron scales, antique clocks and small, wood
cages for homing pigeons.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak has a typical background. Like many Christians in the
Bethlehem area, most of his family left the tumultuous Middle East
for Latin America. He sold most of his inventory and headed to
Chile himself when the Palestinian Intifada uprising of the late
1980s scared off Israeli customers.
</P>
<P>
   He returned in late 1993, after the signing of the Oslo peace
plan. A few years later, he moved his store to its current
location. It is a lone building along one of the West Bank's
so-called ``bypass roads,'' constructed to give Israelis access to
West Bank settlements without traveling through Palestinian towns.
</P>
<P>
   The route takes just 15 minutes from Jerusalem and passes
through one Israeli army checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
   The customers are back in full. Mubarak even supplied antiques
for the sets of ``The Body,'' an Antonio Banderas movie filmed
here. It will be released later in the year.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent day, I sat with Mubarak's son, 19-year-old Amir, who
told me about his experiences in South America. An Israeli browser
overheard us and engaged us in Spanish, saying he learned the
language in his native Greece.
</P>
<P>
   When prodded on politics, the elder Mubarak says the Israeli
occupation of the West Bank is ``clearly unjust.''
</P>
<P>
   But, amid the antiques, the Israelis, and the Spanish music on
the tape deck, he adds, ``I don't understand politics.''

<P>
   In a few weeks, a modified Minuteman missile will blast off from
Vandenberg Air Force Base in California and arc gently over the
blue Pacific. As the intercontinental ballistic missile approaches
the Marshall Islands, 4,300 miles west of Los Angeles, a sheet of
white flames will erupt from beneath a second missile on nearby
Kwajalein Atoll.
</P>
<P>
   In the minutes that follow, a high-speed drama will unfold 140
miles in the sky. Using radar and infrared eyes, the second,
interceptor, missile will delicately adjust its trajectory until it
is aimed into the flight path of the ICBM.
</P>
<P>
   If a collision takes place _ and most defense experts believe it
will _ the United States will have at long last perfected a
practical means of protecting American cities from a limited
missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   This summer President Clinton will decide whether to approve
construction of 20 to 100 interceptors. Based in either Alaska or
North Dakota, they would protect all 50 states against a limited
ICBM attack.
</P>
<P>
   The quest for a missile shield began in 1945. Fearing this
technology would set off a new type of arms race, Washington and
Moscow later signed the 1972 Antiballistic Missile treaty, which
allowed limited antimissile deployment. The Soviets ringed Moscow,
the United States activated one Safeguard ABM installation in
Nekoma, N.D., in 1976. After only four months it was shut down as
too costly to operate.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years later, in March 1983, President Ronald Reagan
reintroduced the idea with his Strategic Defense Initiative. Dubbed
``Star Wars'' by its detractors, the plan called for using
high-tech wizardry, including long-range radars and orbiting
supercomputers, to aim antimissile missiles, lasers and particle
beam weapons at the thousands of incoming warheads that might be
used in a Soviet attack.
</P>
<P>
   Before defense contractors could solve the myriad problems
involved in distinguishing real warheads from dummy warheads and
putting kill vehicles and laser beams on targets, the Soviet Union
went belly up. An operational system was never built.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Cold War competition between the superpowers began to
recede, and the need for an ICBM shield seemed to diminish, a new
threat emerged from a long-simmering conflict in a technologically
backward corner of the world. The Gulf War erupted and the Iraqis
hurled about 90 Scud missiles against Israel, Saudi Arabia and
coalition forces.
</P>
<P>
   One of those Scuds loaded with conventional explosives struck a
barracks near Bahrain, killing 28 U.S. soldiers. Overnight,
Americans learned that they now faced two distinctly different
missile threats, the familiar threat against our homeland, and a
new threat against fighting and peacekeeping forces in foreign
theaters of war.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Gulf War, intelligence experts say, both types of
missile threats have intensified. Some weapons analysts believe
that Iranian and Iraqi rockets now can reach Paris and London.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 Tokyo was drawn into the crosshairs following the
successful launch of a North Korean Taepo Dong 1 missile.
Intelligence reports presented to Congress predict that a
longer-range Taepo Dong 2 could deposit North Korean weapons of
mass destruction on Honolulu or Anchorage, Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our nation today faces a changing world and an increasingly
diverse and proliferating air and missile threat,'' said Gen. John
M. Urias. As program executive officer for the U.S. Army Air and
Missile Defense Command, he is the Pentagon's point man for
developing the hardware that would make a missile defense shield
work. ``Two elements are needed to counter this threat _ theater
missile defense and national missile defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Theater missile defense, which shoots down short-range missiles
and cruise missiles, will protect armed forces in combat zones.
National missile defense will protect American soil against weapons
of mass destruction carried by fast-moving ICBMs.
</P>
<P>
   While the theater and national defense systems draw heavily on
research and development that led to the original Safeguard shield
around missile silos, they differ in one critical respect:
precision.
</P>
<P>
   When Safeguard was conceived, microprocessors did little more
than simple math. The technology to steer one speeding missile in
the path of another simply didn't exist. To compensate for that
lack of precision, the Spartan and Sprint missiles used in the
Safeguard system were tipped with low-yield nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Improvements in computer technology now permit a simpler
physics, the brute force of two objects colliding at 16,000 mph.
``We hit a bullet with a bullet,'' says Gen. John Costello,
commander of the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command. It is
called ``hit to kill'' technology and it is the heart of both the
theater and national defense shields.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy for protecting battlefields is to engage incoming
missiles at each stage of their flight path. If it is completely
deployed, the theater missile defense system will work something
like this: During the enemy missile's boost phase, just after it
has left its launch pad and when it is heavily laden with fuel and
moving relatively slowly, it will be fired upon by one of the Air
Force's airborne lasers. If the target eludes the laser, the Navy
Theater Wide system will begin firing Standard missiles from an
Aegis cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   If it is still airborne, the Army's Theater High Altitude Area
Defense system steps in. It takes its first shot when the missile
is at about 60 miles _ if needed, it can fire again at lower
altitudes. Missiles surviving the gauntlet will then come
head-to-head with the Army's Patriot Advanced Capability-3, Medium
Extended Air Defense System or the Navy Area Defense system. ``The
cumulative kill probability of these systems would provide a nearly
leakproof defense,'' says Urias.
</P>
<P>
   While theater missile defense must be flexible enough to fight
wherever duty calls, the national missile defense system will have
one unchanging mission: to protect all 50 states from a limited
ICBM attack. Here, the operational strategy is to engage incoming
missiles at long ranges and at high altitudes.
</P>
<P>
   The muscle for the knockout punch will be delivered by
ground-based interceptor missiles stored in underground silos and
on 24-hour alert. The missile will consist of a multistage solid
fuel rocket and a kill vehicle with on-board guidance to direct it
to its deadly rendezvous.
</P>
<P>
   Interceptors will have several sets of eyes. A solid-state,
phased array X-band radar will perform long-range detection,
tracking and target classification. The missile's on-board radar
will use the same transmit/receive modules as THAAD missiles.
Infrared eyes will help to distinguish real warheads from dummy
warheads by reading their heat signatures.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the new $12.5 billion national missile defense
system is linked to two future events. One is technical, the other
diplomatic. The obvious technical hurdle is the next interception
test, which will most likely take place in May. Despite two earlier
failures, engineers close to the program expect it to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   A more curious problem has emerged on the diplomatic front.
Russia has warned State Department officials that deploying a
national missile defense would break the 1972 ABM treaty, which
limits the number and type of defensive missiles either country may
install.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed solution to this dilemma shows just how much the
world has changed. To encourage Moscow to drop its objections, two
key U.S. senators have suggested that the Pentagon share its
missile defense secrets with our former adversaries, so they, too,
can be protected against attacks by rogue nations.

SHE TOOK THE BULLET, BUT NOW SHE CALLS THE SHOTS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sofia Coppola mumbles. She slouches. She twists and twirls her
hair a lot. She can be painfully shy. She isn't much of a
storyteller and will take the visual over the verbal any day of the
week.
</P>
<P>
   These things become immediately apparent when you spend time
with the 28-year-old daughter of high-powered director Francis Ford
Coppola, a young woman who up until now has been most famous for
being a bad actress.
</P>
<P>
   But Sofia Coppola never wanted to be an actress in the first
place. When her father cast her as Michael Corleone's daughter in
``The Godfather, Part III,'' she gamely went along with the idea,
mostly because she was bored with school at the time. She never had
any illusions, though, about her talent in front of a camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't even supposed to be in the movie,'' Coppola says
softly. ``I was in Rome on Christmas vacation, and they called and
asked me to come to the set. Winona Ryder had dropped out of the
production, and I had already read the part during a round table
reading. My father asked, and I said yes. I just kind of jumped
into it. I never thought about the hugeness of the movie or all the
hoopla surrounding it. When I was there, I was just trying to stay
afloat.''
</P>
<P>
   She hated almost every minute of it. ``The Godfather III'' was a
preordained disappointment (how do you follow the first two
chapters?), and Sofia received much of the blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``The criticism was really intended for me,'' Francis Ford
Coppola says. ``Just like the end of the story, when the little
girl gets the bullet that was meant for her father.''
</P>
<P>
   The little girl is now a grown woman, and after successful
career stints as a photographer and fashion designer, she believes
she has found the job she knew she wanted all along. Coppola has
directed her first film, ``The Virgin Suicides,'' a movie she
adapted herself from Jeffrey Eugenides' novel about five lustrous
sisters who commit suicide and the young boys who can't shake their
memory.
</P>
<P>
   Coppola believes directing was something she always knew she
could do. But, ``When something's really close to you, you don't
see it,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean she wasn't aware of the career possibilities.
There are those famous genes, of course, not that her father
encouraged her one way or the other. (``He wants you to follow your
own path,'' she says.) Coppola made quite a few home videos when
she was young, and took great pleasure in ``getting the other kids
to do what I wanted them to do.'' In fact, what soured her on
acting (besides all the bad reviews) was the inability to boss
people around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not interested in having someone dictate my choices to
me,'' she says. ``I like to be the one doing the dictating.''
</P>
<P>
   She might be the most placid dictator in history. Contrasting
with her famously animated father, Coppola prefers to be seen, not
heard. When directing a scene, she stands right by the camera, in
order, she says, to make the actors feel more relaxed. But it's
probably out of necessity, too; otherwise no one would ever hear
what the soft-spoken Coppola had to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never worked with a director that quiet,'' says actress
Kirsten Dunst, who plays Lux Lisbon, the oldest ``Suicides''
sister. ``Sofia never raised her voice once. She was always so
calm, so collected and so open to other people's ideas. But
underneath that calmness, she was in total control. She always had
an answer and a reason for whatever was happening in the scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Such assurance came from Coppola's total familiarity with the
material. Coppola read ``The Virgin Suicides'' four years ago and
immediately connected with the story, for reasons she's not able
(or willing) to articulate. After learning that someone had already
purchased the film rights to the book, Coppola decided to write a
screenplay anyway, figuring it would be a good exercise if nothing
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt really protective about the book, and I had all these
ideas about how it should be done,'' Coppola says. ``So I'd write
on the weekends, and before I knew it, I was halfway through, and I
thought, 'Well, I should finish it.' When it was done, I had
pictured every shot.''
</P>
<P>
   She had pictured it so well that when producer Julie Costanzo
passed her screenplay along to the company that owned the book,
they ditched their plans and offered Coppola the directing job.
Costanzo says it was the writing, not the family name, that got
Coppola hired, although Francis Ford Coppola did come on board as
one of the film's producers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Dunst, ``The Virgin Suicides'' stars James Woods
and Kathleen Turner, who played Coppola's mother in Francis Ford
Coppola's 1986 film ``Peggy Sue Got Married.'' Woods, playing
against type as a milquetoast father, ultimately became Coppola's
most outspoken and protective supporter, proclaiming, ``I hope this
movie is a success so that all the naysayers who slammed her when
she was a teen-ager because her father cast her in a movie will
finally get to shut up.''
</P>
<P>
   Coppola smiles when told of Woods' comments, but if she's bitter
about anything in her past, she does a good job of hiding it. She
married director Spike Jonze (``Being John Malkovich'') last summer
at her parents' estate in the Napa Valley. (Was it close to that
big wedding scene in ``The Godfather''? Coppola: ``Kind of,
yeah.'')
</P>
<P>
   She talks now of being a ``supportive wife'' for Jonze and
wanting to learn to be a ``homemaker.'' The couple lives in Los
Feliz.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'd really like to learn to do is cook,'' Coppola says.
</P>
<P>
   Might her father have some input in that area?
</P>
<P>
   ``He says he's going to teach me how,'' she says. ``And that's a
pretty good thing because he's almost as good a cook as he is a
director.''!end! &QL;

&HT;     SIMPLICITY: HOW HARD CAN THAT BE? 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The latest fad in this complicated world is
simplicity and how to achieve it. Apparently, the first thing you
have to do is complicate your life with more magazines and Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Time Inc. has a new magazine called Real Simple, which offers
all kinds of helpful household hints to reduce complication in the
lives of people who are apparently so simple-minded they don't know
how to clean the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Oprah Winfrey has a brand-new magazine, called O, The Oprah
Magazine, aimed at women who need simpler and more fulfilling
lives. Oprah also has her O2Simplify.com Web site, which offers
overstressed women helpful hints about everything from packing an
easy and nutritious school lunch (try bagels or sliced cheese, bet
you never thought of those) to step-by-step advice on how to start
your own business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lock onto a vision'' is the first step. Say, how about a
magazine selling simplicity?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there's another new magazine called Simplicity. It's
aimed at professional women looking for meaning and balance in
their lives. According to a recent Examiner interview with the
editors, the magazine teaches such useful skills as how to go to
work with ``bed hair,'' and reassures the young professional that
she won't have to give up cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of simplicity is that? Don't make roaming calls?
</P>
<P>
   The new simplicity magazines are a logical and slightly more
complicated outgrowth of the ``voluntary simplicity movement.'' One
of that movement's gurus, Duane Elgin, says it consists of frugal
consumption, ecological awareness and personal growth.
</P>
<P>
   A Web site for the movement features a passage from Henry David
Thoreau. Thoreau moved to the woods and built a cabin, but you can
take a workshop and tape course called ``Transforming your
Relationship with Money and Achieving Financial Independence.''
</P>
<P>
   To take the course, simply transform $60 of your money into the
promoters' account.
</P>
<P>
   Voluntary simplicity is fine, but as recent temblors in the
stock market remind us, young professional Americans may have to
learn about involuntary simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving the '00s may take more than cutting down on cell phone
calls, buying the small Land Rover and only ordering off the
appetizer menus of your favorite fusion restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   The simplicity magazines seem to be both too simple and too
complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Real Simple's feature on how to clean a bathroom, for example,
says to clean from the top of the bathroom down, as if people are
so simple that they purposely wash the floors first and walk around
in water while they clean the mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many young professional males follow an even simpler
rule in cleaning bathrooms: Wash the parts that smell, ignore the
rest.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Simple Solutions'' section of the Real Simple Web site has
such brilliant advice as, ``Every time you bring something new into
your house, like a new set of sheets, donate the oldest set to a
charity.''
</P>
<P>
   Have any of these people at Real Simple ever taken the time to
donate something to a charity? It takes time. It isn't simple. You
have to take that old set of sheets to the Salvation Army in some
godforsaken part of town and fill out a form stating how much you
think they're worth, which will later take a lot of explaining to
the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   For real simplicity, tear the sheets into rags and wash the more
pungent parts of the bathroom with them. Then throw the rags away,
and let the environment take care of itself.
</P>
<P>
   The sad fact of American life is that no one is throwing
anything away, and if you take a walk though upscale shopping
districts you notice that people are acquiring a lot of things they
don't need at all, like frames for pet photographs, olive pitters
and everything at Restoration Hardware.
</P>
<P>
   If you want simplicity, live on the streets, a lifestyle that
may be in the cards for many of you paid in stock options. Even
then you'll find yourself needing a bigger shopping cart.
</P>
<P>
   Another fact of American life is that young people aren't
learning to cook. America has become New York, with all the young,
overworked people going to the latest restaurants and eating out of
cardboard boxes.
</P>
<P>
   We have a generation of people calling themselves ``foodies''
who don't know how to make a grilled cheese sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   Real Simple has a feature on one-dish meals that can be prepared
in 30 minutes. Sorry, these recipes far overestimate the culinary
ability of young Netizens in search of the simpler life, while at
the same time having disgusting pseudo-gourmet names like
``Pineapple shrimp with scallions and rice.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, the dot-commies can find the canned pineapple, but do they
know how to shell and de-vein shrimp? Is there fresh basil,
cilantro and scallion in the refrigerator with the leftover pizza?
And frankly, I'd rather eat the leftover pizza.
</P>
<P>
   The one Real Simple one-dish meal that sounded appetizing was
``Lentil Stew with Sausage and Potatoes.'' Somehow, though, I doubt
the young, overworked programmers will rinse and pick through dried
lentils instead of going out to the Universal Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, if the recession ever comes, and simplicity becomes
involuntary, the young folks can line up at soup kitchens for bowls
of lentil stew _ hold the arugula and feta cheese.
</P>
<P>
   That's simplicity, and it sounds easier than it is.

 &HT;    POLITICAL PLATFORMS BECOMING INTERACTIVE AFFAIRS
 &HT;    360&AMP;add. Moving in the (w) Washington and (p) political
categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Internet is breathing new life into political
party platforms, those long, dry-as-dust documents that in the past
often went unread _ even by the presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Al Gore, the prospective Democratic nominee,
launched a plan that lets anybody draft a plank online for the
upcoming party platform. By Tuesday, more than 2,000 people had
done so and received ``personalized'' thank-you letters from Gore
and Joe Andrew, the Democratic national chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of it as the world's best civics lesson, one that allows
us you to craft your own manifesto,'' said Joshua King, a spokesman
for Speakout.com, the Web site that cut a deal with the Democrats
to host the novel platform-drafting service.
</P>
<P>
   Speakout.com, a for-profit site which includes both well-known
Democrats and Republicans on its advisory board, also supplies
sophisticated software that lets users easily cut, paste and edit
parts of the 1996 Democratic platform to create their own 2000
version.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nicholson, the Republican national chairman, has bought into
a more modest set of interactive tools from the same site,
including chat rooms, surveys and e-mail messages to candidates and
other political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great initiative,'' said Larry Purpuro, deputy chief of
staff for the Republican National Committee and the party's top
guru for online activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the Web must be a two-way form of communication, and
we hope to have a fully interactive issues forum for voters up on
our site in the near future,'' Purpuro added. It will include a
comparable ability for outsiders to draft GOP platform language, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there's no guarantee that the presidential
candidates or their top political minions will pay attention to the
online submissions before the final handiwork is made public in
August at their national conventions.
</P>
<P>
   But King, a former aide to President Clinton, held out some
hope. ``If they're smart about it,'' he said, ``they'll find some
golden nuggets here and they'll cite them.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Indiana Republicans on Tuesday became the first
statewide group to stage ``high-tech platform hearings'' on its Web
site. Purpuro said other Republican state parties, beginning with
California, will soon follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to adapt to new technology. In this day and age, it's
quite difficult to get folks to come to a meeting to give their
views,'' said Lisa Kobe, a state party spokesperson in
Indianapolis. ``And, frankly, it's unnecessary,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking input on ``what are the most critical issues to be
included in the 2000 GOP platform'' Mike McDaniel, the Indiana
Republican state chairman, has created an e-mail address _
platform2000(at)aol.com _ to solicit testimony.
</P>
<P>
   National political parties have been writing platforms since
1840, when the Democrats adopted a compact 1,000-word document. In
1996, their platform ran to some 18,000 words, but others have been
as long as 40,000 words.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 platforms are widely expected to be the first ever to
cite the Internet. The Democrats, in particular, have made an issue
of the need to close the ``digital divide,'' one of Gore's favorite
themes and the topic of a speech that Clinton gave in Chicago on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   On the Web: Speakout.com.

   ``We think the Web must be a two-way form of communication, and
we hope to have a fully interactive issues forum for voters up on
our site in the near future,'' Purpuro added. It will include a
comparable ability for outsiders to draft GOP platform language, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there's no guarantee that the presidential
candidates or their top political minions will pay attention to the
online submissions before the final handiwork is made public in
August at their national conventions.
</P>
<P>
   But King, a former aide to President Clinton, held out some
hope. ``If they're smart about it,'' he said, ``they'll find some
golden nuggets here and they'll cite them.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Indiana Republicans on Tuesday became the first
statewide group to stage ``high-tech platform hearings'' on its Web
site. Purpuro said other Republican state parties, beginning with
California, will soon follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to adapt to new technology. In this day and age, it's
quite difficult to get folks to come to a meeting to give their
views,'' said Lisa Kobe, a state party spokesperson in
Indianapolis. ``And, frankly, it's unnecessary,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking input on ``what are the most critical issues to be
included in the 2000 GOP platform'' Mike McDaniel, the Indiana
Republican state chairman, has created an e-mail address _
platform2000(at)aol.com _ to solicit testimony.
</P>
<P>
   National political parties have been writing platforms since
1840, when the Democrats adopted a compact 1,000-word document. In
1996, their platform ran to some 18,000 words, but others have been
as long as 40,000 words.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 platforms are widely expected to be the first ever to
cite the Internet. The Democrats, in particular, have made an issue
of the need to close the ``digital divide,'' one of Gore's favorite
themes and the topic of a speech that Clinton gave in Chicago on
Tuesday.

&HT;     IT TAKES A PARISH 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Long after all the reasonable folks in the
parish knew that Connie Ebora's dog was never coming back, Connie
kept praying.
</P>
<P>
   Every weekday morning with Mother Teresa's Missionaries of
Charity in the convent behind St. Paul's Church, Connie was on her
knees. During weekend Masses in the church, or in the school gym
next door when St. Paul's closed for earthquake retrofitting,
Connie wouldn't let up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I asked the Mother of God, `Please give me my dog
back,''' she said. ``I told the Sacred Heart (of Jesus), `My heart
is broken. Please help me find my dog.' I know it sounds crazy, but
I prayed every night at home to Eileen, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Eileen'' is not a Catholic saint, but Eileen Keane, a lifelong
St. Paul's parishioner who died in February 1999 at the age of 82.
</P>
<P>
   It was she who, eight years ago, adopted a wiry little
strawberry-blond mutt from the pound and named him ``Barney.'' It
was she who, in the last, debilitating months of her life,
entrusted Barney to Connie Ebora for walks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was a little puppy, Eileen would stick Barney in her
coat and take him into church for Mass,'' Connie said. ``He loves
going to church. That's why I took him with me every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was from his customary spot in the foyer of St.
Paul's that Barney disappeared Dec. 4. Connie had tied him to the
wrought iron gates that lead to the choir loft and gone to Mass.
</P>
<P>
   How he got loose and lost no one knows.
</P>
<P>
   Some kids who were playing outside the church may have taken him
or chased him away, but they never copped to the deed. Then there
were reports of ``a lady in an SUV'' who drove by, claimed Barney
was her dog and scooped him up.
</P>
<P>
   All that really mattered was, Connie Ebora's dog was gone, she
was devastated, and the entire parish was totally bummed out.
</P>
<P>
   Which was kind of ironic.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty years old and decades-retired from her job at the Social
Security Administration, Connie had been a familiar face around St.
Paul's since moving to the parish in 1983. Despite some sacristan
duties a few years back, though, the diminutive Hawaii native
tended to keep to herself. Few parishioners knew much about her.
</P>
<P>
   But everybody knew that she and her little dog with the white
triangle on his forehead were inseparable. So, when word got out
that Barney had been snatched (Lord knows he wouldn't have left on
his own accord), everyone felt the loss.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, flyers with Barney's picture were posted all over
the area. People haunted the city and SPCA animal shelters. On
their daily walks or jogs, they kept an eye out and asked
shopkeepers and passersby if they'd seen a little guy with a
``white star'' on his face.
</P>
<P>
   As the days turned into weeks and months, several folks,
including St. Paul's pastor Father Mario Farana, tried to buy
Connie a new dog. Just the sight of her walking the streets, head
down, crying and wearing her grief like a 500-pound shroud, was
unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   But Connie said no.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them, `I don't need another dog. I have a dog. I have
Barney, and he needs me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine's Day came and went, as did Ash Wednesday, St.
Patrick's Day and the first day of spring. The weather turned soft;
the buds on the trees bloomed.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone but Connie figured Barney had gone home to God.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on April 2, Marie Doherty, a St. Paul's parishioner for 40
years, made one of her periodic visits to the city's animal control
shelter. She'd come, as usual, to drop off old towels, blankets and
bundled newspapers for the shelter staff to use in its pet rescue
work.
</P>
<P>
   As she had since Barney's disappearance, Marie added a tour of
the just-rescued and now-adoptable pets section. There, in a cage
bearing the nameplate ``Sandy,'' she saw a little terrier-like dog
with white on his forehead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was Barney. I recognized him from church,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Marie's message didn't get to Connie until the next day. But as
soon as the shelter opened, Ruth Tortorelli, St. Paul's rectory
secretary, drove her down.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Barney saw me, he was climbing all over the door, saying,
`Get me out! Get me out!' He was so happy to see me,'' said Connie.
</P>
<P>
   According to Charlie Miller, the shelter representative, it's
``very unusual'' for a dog to be on the loose for four months and
end up reunited with its owner. And though Barney had lost weight,
he showed no signs of abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barney only got to the shelter March 26,'' said Tortorelli,
the church secretary. ``I asked him where he spent the rest of the
time, but he's not talking.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the people of St. Paul's feel as though the parish
got an early Easter gift.
</P>
<P>
   ``Total strangers stop me and say, `Oh, I'm so happy you got
Barney back!' I had no idea so many people supported me. It's just
amazing,'' said Connie.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as longtime parishioner Elsa Vida put it so succinctly:
``It's a miracle.''

WESTERN TO BE SHOT IN TEXAS HAS WEST POINT BACKGROUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brackettville, Texas, once confused with the fictional Nike
commercial town of ``Bracketville,'' appears to be the new West
Point of the West.
</P>
<P>
   Black Knight Films has begun shooting a western at Alamo
Village, a movie set and entertainment park just outside the South
Texas town, and the film has an unusual connection to the U.S.
Military Academy at West Point, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   But not in the story, titled ``Jericho.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an 1870 piece in the tradition of `Shane,''' said Gil
Dorland, Black Knight chairman. ``It's about a guy who loses his
memory and doesn't know who he is. The story is his odyssey to find
his memory. He begins to learn that he was a gunslinger, but he
doesn't know if he was a good guy or bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorland promises the film will have an unusual twist at the end.
</P>
<P>
   Dorland, a writer and director, is also a former Vietnam combat
commander and a West Point graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Black Knight president, Merlin Miller, is a movie producer and
director. He's directing ``Jericho,'' and is also a West Point
graduate.
</P>
<P>
   John Draper, a member of Black Knight's board of directors, is
an investment banker who graduated from West Point. Renny Rozzoni,
another board member involved in the film's marketing, graduated
from the academy as well.
</P>
<P>
   It would seem nearly impossible for the company to keep this
kind of U.S. Army connection going into the casting of the film,
but it did. Soap opera star Mark Valley, who plays Jack Deveraux on
``Days of Our Lives,'' is cast in the title role as ``Jericho.''
</P>
<P>
   Valley was previously on ``Another World.'' He has appeared in
several feature films including ``The Innocent'' with Anthony
Hopkins. And he is also a West Point graduate.
</P>
<P>
   It makes you feel kind of sorry for the film's co-star, rodeo
clown Leon Coffee. Coffee is a horse trainer, a bulldogger, and
calf roper, and he served in the Army for three years. But he was
an enlisted man who never went to West Point.
</P>
<P>
   North Texas artist and film star Buck Taylor is also starring in
``Jericho.'' He didn't go to West Point either.
</P>
<P>
   Dorland said the West Point connection was somewhat
serendipitous when it came to Valley's casting. He wasn't selected
because of his academy connection, Dorland said.
</P>
<P>
   The film company first sought a New Mexico location for
``Jericho,'' but settled on Bracketville because it was
logistically more economical.
</P>
<P>
   ``In New Mexico, we would have had to go to several places to do
the film,'' Dorland said. ``Alamo Village can be four or five
different towns.''
</P>
<P>
   Filming is also taking place along the Rio Grande at Rancho Rio
Grande, a ranch owned by Galveston businessman Bill Moody. Both
Rancho Rio Grande and Alamo Village were used in the filming of
``Lonesome Dove.'' Alamo Village was first built as the site of
John Wayne's saga, ``The Alamo.''
</P>
<P>
   During the recent NCAA Basketball Championships, Nike
commercials featured a fictional town where life revolved around
basketball. It was called Bracketville. Nike later filmed some of
their ads in the South Texas town.
</P>
<P>
   There is no release date yet for ``Jericho,'' but Dorland calls
the script ``one of those wonderful scripts Hollywood has forgotten
about.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jericho'' is considered a low-budget movie at a cost of less
than $2 million.

&HT;     TAKING LIBERTIES WITH THE TRUTH FOR THE SAKE OF ART 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CYNTHIA BASS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The ``based on a true story'' movie is hot. This
year's winner _ so far, anyway _ is blockbluster ``Erin
Brockovich.'' Last year, it was ``The Hurricane'' and ``The
Insider.'' Before that, ``A Civil Action.''
</P>
<P>
   We seem destined to glean our ``facts'' through the arts.
</P>
<P>
   This is nothing new. Almost everything most of us think we know,
for example, about William Randolph Hearst or California's water
wars comes from the movies _ ``Citizen Kane'' or ``Chinatown.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor is this phenomenon limited to film, or to America. In the
19th century, it was said that the English learned most of their
history from Shakespeare's plays.
</P>
<P>
   April 18 was the anniversary of a historical moment remembered
primarily because of its rendering as ``true story'' art. The
moment is a night in 1775 before the American Revolution. The
artist is poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. The art is Longfellow's
famous poem, ``Paul Revere's Ride,'' written 85 years after the
event.
</P>
<P>
   The discrepancies between Revere's real ride and his ride in the
poem are many, and they not only offer us insights into how artists
show history, but also force us to question how seriously (if at
all) we should trust artists to tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   The real Paul Revere, by the way, understood very well that
artists fudge the truth, especially since he did so himself in a
noted work of pre-Revolution propaganda: a popular, inflammatory
and grossly inaccurate engraving of the Boston Massacre (1770),
which made for a far more interesting story than what actually
happened.
</P>
<P>
   An ardent voice for American independence _ one of the original
Sons of Liberty and an organizer of the Boston Tea Party _ Revere
took many midnight rides before his most famous one, organizing a
network of fellow patriots ready to warn the countryside if and
when the Redcoats decided to move.
</P>
<P>
   The network worked as designed: On the night of April 18, when
he rode off to Lexington, the roads out of Boston (contrary to the
poem) were full not only of Longfellow's ``flowing moonlight'' and
British Regulars, but of Paul Revere's mounted friends.
</P>
<P>
   After his ride, Revere was a local hero. But the Revolution had
produced lots of local heroes. Revere was just one brave patriot
among many, until Longfellow came along.
</P>
<P>
   In his own realm, Longfellow too was a hero. One of the first
American poets to write about American subjects, he was also the
first to introduce American readers to modern European languages
and poetry (``Hiawatha,'' for instance, employed a Finnish
folk-meter completely alien to New World readers).
</P>
<P>
   Like Revere, Longfellow was a patriot. And in 1860, with civil
war looking inevitable, he decided, through poetry, to remind his
countrymen of their shared heritage. The result was ``Paul Revere's
Ride.''
</P>
<P>
   But Longfellow was more than a patriot; he was a poet, too, and
he knew the demands of poetry aren't the same as the demands of
history. To emphasize the point of Revere's ride (``the fate of a
nation was riding that night''), Longfellow took many liberties
with the real story, altering the facts in order to dramatize them.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the famous lantern signal (``One if by land, and
two if by sea/ And I on the opposite shore will be'') was not
flashed to Revere but to his compatriots in Charlestown; Revere was
still in Boston when the signal was sent.
</P>
<P>
   It's much more dramatic, however, to have Revere himself, not
some nameless men from across the river, eagerly watching the
belfry. And it's much more exciting to have Revere ride not just to
Lexington but Concord too, although in reality he never made it to
Concord (he was stopped by a British patrol).
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest change Longfellow made _ and the change which
makes the poem so good _ was his dramatic portrayal of Revere as
the brave lone rider who saves his country, when in reality, his
role in saving the country was as a part of a highly organized
group. In short, Revere was brave indeed, but he was hardly ever
alone that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul Revere's Ride'' was an instant hit (except with
historians). It made its local hero a national treasure, and it
presented a whole new look to the American Revolution, a look
which, however inaccurate, has remained a lively part of our view
of the past for more than 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   On the recent anniversary of Paul Revere's real ride, what
lesson can Paul Revere's imaginary ride teach us?
</P>
<P>
   Just this: Art accompanied by a ``based on a true story'' tag
line should be regarded with a great deal of skepticism. This isn't
because of an artist's political biases, though they too must be
considered, but because of an artist's artistic biases.
</P>
<P>
   Filmmakers, novelists, poets often mislead us, not deliberately,
but because it's just hard not to play with the truth when a little
adjustment here, a falsehood there, will help make a good scene, or
a good story, or a good poem, great.

TORIES RENEW DEBATE ON ASYLUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed) 
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ For months, Britain's Conservatives have accused the
Labor government of turning Britain into a ``soft touch'' for
``bogus asylum seekers,'' saying that most refugees come here to
exploit British generosity, not to escape persecution at home.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Tories turned up the heat. In a major policy
speech meant to seize the upper hand in an increasingly bitter
debate, the Conservative Party leader, William Hague, said new
asylum seekers should be immediately placed in secure detention
centers and then deported within about six weeks if their claims
are rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next Conservative government will detain all new
applicants for asylum, whether port applicants or in-country
applicants, in reception centers until their cases have been
determined,'' Hague told the Social Market Foundation, a
right-leaning think tank. ``This policy will have a significant
deterrent effect on those thinking of traveling here without a
well-founded case.''
</P>
<P>
   The government immediately denounced Hague's proposal as
``cynical,'' saying, in the words of Jack Straw, the home
secretary: ``William Hague's speech is further confirmation that
the Conservatives are more interested in exploiting the asylum
issue than they are in dealing with it.''
</P>
<P>
   But neither Straw nor the other government officials who spoke
out against Hague Tuesday accused him of going too far. Instead,
they took pains to present themselves as the party with the tougher
asylum policy, intent on quickly weeding out refugees who have no
business being here.
</P>
<P>
   To drive home his point, Straw noted that the Tories had opposed
a number of elements of the recently enacted immigration bill,
including one that forces truck drivers to pay a penalty of about
$3,300 for each illegal refugee they bring into the country. They
had also tried to block Labor's plan to replace the system of cash
benefits for asylum seekers with a much more stringent one of
vouchers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his own response, David Blunkett, the education secretary,
said that the government would ``not tolerate people believing
Britain is a soft touch.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, more than 71,000 people applied for asylum in
Britain, a record number that reflected the rise in upheavals in
Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia and South America. With some 375,000
people applying for asylum around Europe in 1998, the most recent
year for which official figures are available, the problem is
hardly limited to Britain. But the government has been increasingly
vulnerable to the charge that its asylum policy _ and not the
increase in the total number of refugees from around the world _ is
what is attracting so many asylum seekers to Britain.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Straw defended his government's harsh new
immigration law, saying that it had already built a detention
center in Oakington, Cambridge, with room for 400 asylum seekers,
and begun dispersing other new arrivals around the country. He also
pointed out that 10,000 asylum applications had been processed last
month, making a slight dent in a backlog of 103,000 outstanding
cases. He added that ``removals of asylum seekers are at record
levels.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Straw said some 3,000 ethnic Albanians who fled
Kosovo last summer would be required to leave Britain in the next
few months, when their 12-month permits expired. ``Enforcement
action will be taken in due course against those who are unwilling
to go back voluntarily,'' he said. ``But we will encourage them to
go back voluntarily.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last several weeks, a number of people, including the
British representative to the office of the U.N. high commissioner
for refugees, have accused politicians from both parties of in
essence scrambling for the moral low ground in the asylum debate by
stirring up racist sentiments in a country that has never been
thrilled by the presence of too many foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   The bishop of Croydon, the Rt. Rev. Wilfred Wood, compared the
language in the current debate to the inflammatory words used by
the politician Enoch Powell in his 1968 ``rivers of blood'' speech,
which fueled Britons' worry about black immigration. Bill Morris,
the leader of the Transport and General Workers' Union and one of
Labor's most prominent supporters, accused the government of
fostering a ``climate of fear and loathing'' on race and asylum
issues.
</P>
<P>
   And in the House of Lords, Baroness Scotland of Asthal, a junior
foreign minister and a former member of the Commission for Racial
Equality, said Tuesday that, ``I am becoming increasingly concerned
by the tone of some of the rhetoric which has been voiced in
relation to refugees, where it seems to be almost synonymous an
idea that if one is a refugee, one is somehow unsuitable or
unsound.''
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial, the Daily Mail, which has led the way in
anti-refugee rhetoric, praised Hague's proposal as being ``at one
with ordinary people's serious concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The system is on the verge of a breakdown and it is imperative
that this growing scandal should be debated,'' the paper said.
``This country, with its proud and generous reputation for
welcoming those in genuine need of asylum, simply cannot allow
itself to continue as a soft touch for those who would ruthlessly
exploit our generosity.''

TEAS, FROM GREEN TO `BLACK DRAGON' 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tea soothes, as everyone knows, but it also may be
good for you. Green tea, especially, contains potent antioxidants
called polyphenols. Researchers believe polyphenols prevent cell
damage and may treat or protect against rheumatoid arthritis, skin
tumors, heart disease and oral and digestive-tract cancers.
</P>
<P>
   (So far, laboratory rodents have shown the best results.) Second
to green tea for antioxidant content is oolong tea, and last is the
fully oxidized black tea, which is the favorite of American tea
drinkers.
</P>
<P>
   Black tea has enough flavor to stand up to lemon or milk. Green
tea and even oolong, described by its fans as smoky, fruity,
mellow, bold and sometimes flowery, are acquired tastes. A new Web
site, www.teasofgreen.com, is dedicated to helping beginners
acquire it. The site, the electronic child of Larry and Sachiko
Ormsby in Berkeley, Calif., sells high-grade green and oolong teas
(all loose, no bags), which the Ormsbys import from China, Taiwan
and Japan. They also provide online tea lore.

   Among their green teas is lung ching (also longjin), the most
famous of all, from the West Lake area in Hangzhou, China ($18 for
3 ounces). The taste of green tea is always described as delicate,
and its preparation requires quick dousing of the leaves. Devotees
say that cups made from subsequent steeping of the same leaves are
mellower and taste even better.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan is famous for oolong (the name means black dragon), and
the Ormsbys sell the tea that transformed Taiwan, bai hao ($18 for
2.5 ounces), with its honey and ripe fruit flavors. It is the most
oxidized, or air-cured, of oolongs. This tea was called Oriental
Beauty in the 19th century, when its popularity in the United
States caused a boom on the island.
</P>
<P>
   The oolong rush led to the felling of a camphor forest, the
burning of clearings and the planting of tea up to 4,000 feet in
the hills above the Taipei basin. In 1896, 20 million pounds of
Oriental Beauty brought $3.5 million in America alone. It was then
the costliest tea in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The site also sells oolong tea sets from China, including an
eight-ounce teapot, two cups, a nine-ounce glass pitcher, a bamboo
scoop for leaves and a tea strainer ($58, or $93 with optional
thermos), and green tea sets from Japan ($65, or $98 with
thermos). &QL;

   Sue Slater, who lives in St. Louis, has degrees in business
administration and social work. She also has Type 2 diabetes,
characterized by elevated levels of blood sugar, which she controls
through her diet. But Slater still has a sweet tooth. It has led
her to search out sugar-free desserts in bakeries and restaurants
around the country. The results appear on www.sugarfreesites.com.
</P>
<P>
   The listings, from 20 states, give names, addresses and phone
numbers. For New York, Slater gives about 50 places, including
Zabar's for rugelach; Pozzo Pastry Shop, 690 Ninth Avenue (48th
Street), for poundcake; and Candy Man, 402 13th Avenue in Brooklyn,
for chocolates and candy.
</P>
<P>
   In the interests of research, she has gone into the field to
taste for herself and has received desserts by mail.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping up a Web site is demanding work, maybe a little harder
for Slater than for others because she is also blind. She finds
bakeries and restaurants through the Yellow Pages online, activated
for voice by software, and spends about four hours a day
telephoning them about sugar-free goods. She gets help with the
site from her daughter, Chelsy, 14, and her husband, Larry.

BIG STRIDES FOR SICILIAN REDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Dining)  
 By ERIC ASIMOV   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Historians tracing the story of winemaking in Italy
say that Sicilian vineyards flourished around 2,500 years ago. Wine
lovers might say it's been all downhill from there.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is ever that simple, of course, particularly on the
island of Sicily. With its hilly geography and warm climate, it is
one of the most productive wine regions in the world. But aside
from Marsala, the well-known fortified wine, Sicilian wine has
largely been used for most of the 20th century as a blending agent
for cheap, potent wines or for distilling into spirits.
</P>
<P>
   Things began to improve around 25 years ago, when winemakers,
sensing the vast potential in Sicily, began modernizing their
agricultural methods, equipment and techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the progress is especially apparent in Sicilian red
wines, which seek a careful balance between remaining true to the
island's winemaking history and appealing to international tastes.
These wines have none of the baked, raisiny qualities that are so
often typical of old-fashioned hot-weather red wines, yet they are
by no means Bordeaux or Tuscan knockoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Though some of the wines I tasted incorporated small amounts of
cabernet sauvignon and merlot into their blends, most capitalize on
the flavors of traditional grape varieties, like nero d'avola,
frappato, nerello and others little known outside of Sicily. They
are accessible and enjoyable, and don't require extra aging.
</P>
<P>
   I was impressed by how carefully these wines were made, but I
couldn't help thinking that they ought to be, because they are not
cheap. In tasting a dozen Sicilian reds, I found a general
correlation between price and quality. The $10 to $15 wines tended
to be simple and direct, fine for everyday drinking, while the more
expensive bottles offered hearty complexity, and occasionally even
elegance. &QL;

   Q: Did the PEZ company ever make a Superman PEZ dispenser? I've
looked all over eBay with no luck.
</P>
<P>
   _ S.B., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: Despite rumors to the contrary among collectors, there has
never been a Superman PEZ dispenser, according to ``Collecting
PEZ'' author David Welch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would end up being pretty plain,'' a collector wrote on the
Internet discussion group alt.food.pez. ``Batman, Wonder Woman,
Hulk and Spiderman have distinctive heads or masks ... Superman
just looks like any other guy from the neck up.''
</P>
<P>
   A Washington artist creates made-to-order PEZ dispensers using
casting plaster and modeling clay for $28 to $36. Characters
include Superman, Mr. Natural, Captain Crunch and 40 other figures.
For more information, write to Drew Becker, Box 638, Point Roberts,
WA 98281, or visit the Web site
ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/rumpusroom.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, eBay was founded by Pierre Omidyar in 1995 to
provide a place where his girlfriend could buy PEZ dispensers. More
than 450,000 new items are now auctioned each day on the Web site,
which has 7.7 million registered users.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I find replacement toothbrushes for a SenSonic
electric toothbrush?

MOTHERHOOD MANUAL TAKES THE FAST LANE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA FRAZIER ANDERSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My 13-year-old man child and I were alone in the car listening
to the radio as I drove. A love song was playing, and my son was
singing along quite earnestly. My boy's eyes were closed and his
new, deep voice blended nicely with the voice of the singer.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment, I was admiring my son's new skill because, before
his voice changed, he couldn't carry a tune if you put super glue
on it. Then, he sang something like, ``You and me baby, all night,
all right,'' and I was so shocked that I drifted into the other
lane of traffic.
</P>
<P>
   I veered back into my lane and waved at the driver who was
yelling at me, although I didn't use my middle finger to wave like
she did. Anyway, I quickly changed the radio station to WRR, which
plays classical music.
</P>
<P>
   My son's eyes flew open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom! Why did you do that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do anything. They changed the song,'' I said, joking.
</P>
<P>
   He groaned and rolled his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``So son, do you have a girlfriend yet?'' I asked. It's the
first question from my lesson plan on women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom, please. Dad already told me about girls. Can we talk
about something else?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No. This is a required conversation. I can not let you move
away from home until we have this talk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom, I'm not going anywhere. I'm a kid. And who says we have
to talk about this stuff?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the Motherhood Manual, son. I have to cover a million
lessons in life before you leave home. And yes, you are going
somewhere. College, military, barber school _ I don't know where
exactly, but you must leave at some point. Dad and I need your room
back. We think it would make a fine sauna.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mother!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Son, when you were about 4 years old I told you not to touch
the stove because it was hot. As soon as I turned my back, you
touched it anyway and burned your little finger. As I wiped the
tears from your eyes, you said, `Hot, mama.''' I kissed your finger
and spanked the bad stove. That was a lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, when you were 7 or 8, your great-uncle took you to the
store and bought you $10 worth of candy. I told you not to eat it
all at once so, of course, you went outside and ate every piece.
You were sick for two days. I stayed home from work to take care of
you. That was a lesson, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom, there's no such thing as a Motherhood Manual. Those
things just happened.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, there is a huge manual son, and the lessons get harder
and harder. Sometimes, I don't even understand them. But I'm trying
to teach you everything that I can, to the best of my ability.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is this so important to you?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because if you fail, I fail.''
</P>
<P>
   With a puzzled expression, he wondered, ``Where exactly is this
Motherhood Manual? Can you show it to me?''
</P>
<P>
   I shook my head.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm sorry but I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it's in my heart,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, who put it there?''
</P>
<P>
   How could I explain this to a child?
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually,'' I said, ``you put it there on the day you were
born. When I saw you, it was love at first sight and I vowed to be
the best mom that I could possibly be for you. That means teaching
you a lot a lessons, no matter how hard they are for you or for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   He was quiet for a while. Then he spoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what did you want to tell me about girls?''
</P>
<P>
   I took a deep breath and started class.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honey, girls are wonderful. However...''
</P>

 &HT;    CONGRESS NEARS PASSAGE OF WAY TO DIGITALLY 'SIGN' DOCUMENTS
 &HT;    940&AMP;add. With DIGITAL-CHART. Moving in (w) Washington and (f)
financial categories for release Sunday, April 23.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the flourish of a quill spelling out ``John
Hancock'' or with a simple pencil scratching out an ``X,''
Americans have long used their signatures to seal a deal.
</P>
<P>
   But in the age of the Internet, business owners say electronic
commerce will never reach its full potential unless two parties can
complete a contract by using a computer to ``sign'' and send
legally binding documents.
</P>
<P>
   To speed the development of e-commerce, Congress is in the final
stages of writing legislation to give consumers and businesses the
ability to close contracts with ``digital signatures.'' The House
and Senate have passed versions of a digital signature bill, and
now a conference committee is trying to smooth out differences
between them.
</P>
<P>
   Observers predict compromises may be reached soon enough to
allow a final draft to be passed by Congress and signed into law by
President Clinton before this summer's recess for political party
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   A digital signature works by turning identifying information
into a secret code that only the participating parties can
unscramble. It provides two elements needed to make a contract.
First, it identifies the person who signed the document. Second, it
identifies the document itself, making it virtually impossible to
alter or falsify the signed material.
</P>
<P>
   The nation needs ``a uniform legal framework that will enable
businesses to depend on contracts signed over the Internet,'' said
Rhett Dawson, president of the Information Technology Industry
Council, a trade group supporting digital signature legislation.
</P>
<P>
   House Commerce Committee Chairman Tom Bliley, R-Va., predicts
the legislation will bring about an ``explosion in the growth of
e-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   But while seemingly everyone agrees digital signatures will
hasten the business world's transition to the Internet Age,
consumer advocates are still battling to make sure protections for
the ``little guy'' are embedded in the bill's final version.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no problem with those who want to proceed with
electronic contracts,'' said Margot Saunders, managing attorney for
the Washington office of the National Consumer Law Center. ``But 68
percent of households are not on line.''
</P>
<P>
   Without legal safeguards, those unsavvy consumers could find
themselves signing electronic documents that they do not fully
comprehend, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Attorneys General also has sent a
letter to Congress stating its concerns about the House bill's
potential erosion of consumer protection laws.
</P>
<P>
   Saunders gave examples of what her group fears could happen
without strong consumer safeguards:
</P>
<P>
   _ An elderly woman could be visited by a salesman who talks her
into an overpriced home improvement. He could pull out a laptop
computer and get her to sign the deal, agreeing to receive all bill
notices and disclosures on line. But if she has no computer, she
won't be able to read the contract's fine print.
</P>
<P>
   _ A shopper goes to a car dealership and is told that if he
wants a particular car, he can have it for $25,000, but only if he
signs all documents and accepts all follow-up information on line.
If he wants everything on paper, the car will cost another $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Saunders says consumers must continue to have the option of
getting a contract in writing and signing it with a pen without
financial penalty. They should get follow-up information and bills
mailed to the home, rather than e-mailed to an online address.
Allowing companies to send legally binding notices via e-mail is an
invitation to trouble, she claims, because electronic communication
is far less reliable than traditional mail.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a consumer might agree to receive notices regarding
his health insurance online. But then he runs into financial
trouble and drops his Internet service. When the insurance company
e-mails a notice of the change in terms of coverage, he never sees
it. His child gets sick, and it's not until he gets to the doctor's
office that he discovers his insurance no longer will cover the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a hundred reasons why you might not get an e-mail
sent to you,'' Saunders said. ``We want consumers to have some
assurance that important information will be delivered.''
</P>
<P>
   That means mailing notices out through the U.S. Postal Service,
which, unlike Internet service providers, will forward missives to
new addresses. ``Despite glitches, there is a 99.9 percent chance
that the mail will be reliable,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has passed a bill that recognizes a digital signature
as the paperless equivalent of a written signature on a contract.
But the House has passed a more elaborate version of the
legislation, permitting not only the use of digital signatures, but
also the recognition of electronic records, such as monthly bills.
</P>
<P>
   It is the House version that has stirred up concerns among the
National Consumer Law Center, Consumer Federation of America,
Consumers Union and similar groups who fear it will pre-empt states
from enforcing traditional legal protections for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration supports federal legislation to
recognize digital signatures, but is joining with consumer groups
in calling for more protections in the final bill prepared by the
House-Senate conference committee.
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech industry appears willing to compromise to get the
legislation moving in May. ``We are very hopeful that the minor
differences that exist can be ironed out in short order,'' said
Matthew Tanielian, a lobbyist for the Information Technology
Industry Council.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   A number of private companies, such as VeriSign Inc. of Mountain
View, Calif., and Entrust Technologies Inc. of Plano, Texas, have
developed ways to allow two parties to sign a document without fear
of forgery.
</P>
<P>
   Such companies can create and verify a unique signature by using
cryptography, a branch of applied mathematics dealing with the
conversion of messages into unintelligible forms and back again.
Digital signatures make use of an algorithm using two distinct but
mathematically related ``keys'' needed to open the text and verify
the signer's identity.
</P>
<P>
   VeriSign vice president Michael Baum said using digital
signatures and related products, such as digital time stamps, helps
``hammer down the who, what, where and when of a transaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Employing computer-based methods to document a transaction is
just a new way of doing what people have traditionally done to make
contracts binding, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are writing to a friend about your trip to France, a
33-cent stamp will do just fine,'' he said. But if you are entering
into a contract, ``you probably would make a copy of it, have it
notarized at the bank and send it with a courier,'' he said.
Likewise, a digital signature ``provides probative evidence of a
transaction.''

 &HT;    CONGRESS NEARS PASSAGE OF WAY TO DIGITALLY 'SIGN' DOCUMENTS
 &HT;    940&AMP;add. With DIGITAL-CHART. Moving in (w) Washington and (f)
financial categories for release Sunday, April 23.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the flourish of a quill spelling out ``John
Hancock'' or with a simple pencil scratching out an ``X,''
Americans have long used their signatures to seal a deal.
</P>
<P>
   But in the age of the Internet, business owners say electronic
commerce will never reach its full potential unless two parties can
complete a contract by using a computer to ``sign'' and send
legally binding documents.
</P>
<P>
   To speed the development of e-commerce, Congress is in the final
stages of writing legislation to give consumers and businesses the
ability to close contracts with ``digital signatures.'' The House
and Senate have passed versions of a digital signature bill, and
now a conference committee is trying to smooth out differences
between them.
</P>
<P>
   Observers predict compromises may be reached soon enough to
allow a final draft to be passed by Congress and signed into law by
President Clinton before this summer's recess for political party
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   A digital signature works by turning identifying information
into a secret code that only the participating parties can
unscramble. It provides two elements needed to make a contract.
First, it identifies the person who signed the document. Second, it
identifies the document itself, making it virtually impossible to
alter or falsify the signed material.
</P>
<P>
   The nation needs ``a uniform legal framework that will enable
businesses to depend on contracts signed over the Internet,'' said
Rhett Dawson, president of the Information Technology Industry
Council, a trade group supporting digital signature legislation.
</P>
<P>
   House Commerce Committee Chairman Tom Bliley, R-Va., predicts
the legislation will bring about an ``explosion in the growth of
e-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   But while seemingly everyone agrees digital signatures will
hasten the business world's transition to the Internet Age,
consumer advocates are still battling to make sure protections for
the ``little guy'' are embedded in the bill's final version.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no problem with those who want to proceed with
electronic contracts,'' said Margot Saunders, managing attorney for
the Washington office of the National Consumer Law Center. ``But 68
percent of households are not on line.''
</P>
<P>
   Without legal safeguards, those unsavvy consumers could find
themselves signing electronic documents that they do not fully
comprehend, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Attorneys General also has sent a
letter to Congress stating its concerns about the House bill's
potential erosion of consumer protection laws.
</P>
<P>
   Saunders gave examples of what her group fears could happen
without strong consumer safeguards:
</P>
<P>
   _ An elderly woman could be visited by a salesman who talks her
into an overpriced home improvement. He could pull out a laptop
computer and get her to sign the deal, agreeing to receive all bill
notices and disclosures on line. But if she has no computer, she
won't be able to read the contract's fine print.
</P>
<P>
   _ A shopper goes to a car dealership and is told that if he
wants a particular car, he can have it for $25,000, but only if he
signs all documents and accepts all follow-up information on line.
If he wants everything on paper, the car will cost another $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Saunders says consumers must continue to have the option of
getting a contract in writing and signing it with a pen without
financial penalty. They should get follow-up information and bills
mailed to the home, rather than e-mailed to an online address.
Allowing companies to send legally binding notices via e-mail is an
invitation to trouble, she claims, because electronic communication
is far less reliable than traditional mail.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a consumer might agree to receive notices regarding
his health insurance online. But then he runs into financial
trouble and drops his Internet service. When the insurance company
e-mails a notice of the change in terms of coverage, he never sees
it. His child gets sick, and it's not until he gets to the doctor's
office that he discovers his insurance no longer will cover the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a hundred reasons why you might not get an e-mail

</P>
<P>
   That means mailing notices out through the U.S. Postal Service,
which, unlike Internet service providers, will forward missives to
new addresses. ``Despite glitches, there is a 99.9 percent chance
that the mail will be reliable,'' she said.

10 THINGS EVERY CONSUMER NEEDS TO KNOW ABOUT GENERIC DRUGS
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by GENERIC DRUGS-HOUSE BRANDS and GENERIC(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's happened again. The pharmacist has asked that benign little
question and you don't know what to say. Last week, you were buying
a prescription drug for your baby. Then, the answer rolled easily
off your tongue: No. Now, though, you're getting a prescription
filled from your dermatologist and the matter seems somewhat less
serious. Yes, you'll take the generic, you say, knowing that the
medicine will cost you less.
</P>
<P>
   And so you make a decision _ choose the generic or the brand
name _ almost every time you visit the prescription counter at your
pharmacy. Generic substitutes are available for about half the
drugs in wide use.
</P>
<P>
   Generic versions of brand-name drugs have been available to
consumers in Texas for almost 20 years. Generic drug use in Texas
has skyrocketed from about 18.6 percent of the prescription market
in 1994 to almost half of all drug sales today, according to one
estimate. Nationally, generics captured about 46 percent of the
$121 billion prescription drug market last year.
</P>
<P>
   Generic drugs save consumers an estimated $8 to $10 billion a
year at retail pharmacies, the Congressional Budget Office
estimates. Even more billions are saved when hospitals use
generics.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, consumers know that the generic is cheaper,
providing savings for both them and their health-care providers.
But often, that's the only information a buyer has, leaving him or
her to make an important decision without much guidance.
</P>
<P>
   Are generic drugs exactly the same as the brand-name drugs? Are
they as strong as the brand-name equivalent and do they act as
quickly? Do they have different side effects? In what ways can they
differ from brand-name drugs? What standards do generic drugs have
to meet to gain FDA approval?
</P>
<P>
   The answers to these questions are complex, but they also seem
to be clear. Here, 10 things every consumer should know about
generics to answer your pharmacist's question with confidence.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   1. Generics are chemical clones.
</P>
<P>
   A generic drug is a chemical clone of a drug sold under a brand
name.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmaceutical companies get a 17-year patent on any new brand
drug they develop through their own research. These patents usually
have only a seven-to-eight-year market value since it takes
eight-to-10 years to bring a new drug to the market. When a patent
expires, other companies are free to market the generic versions.
</P>
<P>
   There are generic versions of both prescription and
over-the-counter medicines and often several brand names for the
same drug. For example, ibuprofen is the generic name of the
anti-inflammatory drug sold under the brand names Motrin and Advil.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   2. To be approved by the FDA, generic drugs must be
bioequivalent and therapeutically equivalent to their brand-name
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Under provisions of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the FDA is
required to publish a detailed list of approved generic drugs each
year with monthly updates. ``Approved Drug Products with
Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,'' also known as ``The Orange
Book'' is used by doctors and pharmacists in making generic
substitutions.
</P>
<P>
   These products are considered pharmaceutical equivalents if they
contain the same active ingredient or ingredients, are of the same
dosage form and route of administration, and are identical in
strength or concentration to the name-brand. Since generics use the
same active ingredients and are shown to work the same way in the
body, they have the same risk-benefit profile as their brand-name
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA requires generics to have the same quality, strength,
purity and stability as brand-name drugs. The firm seeking to sell
a generic drug also must show that its drug delivers the same
amount of active ingredient in the same time frame as the original
product.
</P>
<P>
   One way scientists demonstrate bioequivalence is to measure the
time it takes the generic drug to reach the blood stream in 24 to
36 healthy, normal volunteers. This gives them the rate of
absorption _ called bioavailability _ of the generic drug, which
they then compare to that of the pioneer drug. The generic version
must deliver the same amount of active ingredients into a patient's
bloodstream in the same amount of time as the pioneer drug.
</P>
<P>
   Using bioequivalence as the basis for approving generic copies
of drug products was established by the Drug Price Competition and
Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the
``Waxman-Hatch Act.''
</P>
<P>
   ``FDA-approved generic drugs are bioequivalent and
therapeutically equivalent to their brand-name counterparts,'' says
Doug Sporn, former director of the Food and Drug Administration's
Office of Generic Drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no interest in approving generic drugs that are not
therapeutically equivalent,'' says Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of
the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.
</P>
<P>
   ``To date, there are no documented examples of a generic product
manufactured to meet its approved specifications that could not be
used interchangeably with the corresponding brand-name drug,'' says
Dr. Stuart Nightingale, associate commissioner for health affairs
for the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   3. A generic may, however, differ from a brand-name drug in
several ways, and one company's generic version of a drug might be
slightly different from another's.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmaceutically equivalent drug products may differ in
characteristics such as shape, scoring (grooves on the surface of
some tablets), packaging, colors, flavors and preservatives,
expiration date, and within certain limits, labeling.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, though generic drugs are required to contain the
same active ingredients in the same amounts as their brand-name
equivalents, the original and copycats may contain different
preservatives and dyes that can cause problems for some people.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
nn
</P>
<P>
   In a few cases, a patient may actually do better with a generic
that contains a different preservative from the original, or he may
not be able to use the generic at all because the preservative
causes an allergic reaction or irritation.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA monitors reports of adverse drug reactions and has found
no difference in the rates between generic and brand-name drugs. In
other words, there is no evidence to show that, in general, generic
drugs are more likely to cause more side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Because there may be more than one company producing a generic
for a brand-name drug, if you find one that works for you without
causing side effects, you may want to request that same company's
generic when getting a refill or new prescription. Do not assume
you will get the exact same drug.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   4. Generics are not subject to the same extensive clinical
trials as the brand-name drugs in seeking FDA approval.
</P>
<P>
   Generics are not required to replicate the extensive clinical
trials that have already been used in the development of the
original, brand-name drug, according to the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   Brand-name tests usually involve a few hundred to a few thousand
patients. Since the safety and efficacy of the brand-name product
has already been well established in clinical testing _ and
frequently in many years of patient use _ it is scientifically
unnecessary and would be unethical to require that such extensive
testing be repeated on human subjects for each generic drug.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   5. They're made by pharmaceutical companies that must meet FDA
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Generic firms have facilities comparable to brand-name firms.
The FDA conducts approximately 3,500 inspections a year to ensure
standards are met.
</P>
<P>
   Often several pharmaceutical companies make their own generic
versions of a drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases (but not often because it doesn't make financial
sense) when its patent expires, the company making the brand-name
drug begins making its own generic version.
</P>
<P>
   You can always check with the pharmacist to find out who makes a
particular generic or, if you like the generic you are taking, to
make certain your prescription is refilled with the same
substitute.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   7. When generic drugs were introduced in the 1970s, Texas
doctors seemed reluctant to use them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas was the second from the last state in the nation to pass
legislation allowing generic drug substitution \Rin 1981\S,'' Dr.
Marvin Shepherd, professor and director of pharmacy practice and
administration at the University of Texas College of Pharmacy in
Austin. ``We were 10 years behind other states. Doctors wanted to
know specifically what their patients were taking. They wanted
control, and they didn't have a lot of faith in the generic drug
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   8. Generic use declined after a 1989 scandal, but the FDA has
since taken strong steps to monitor the generic drug industry.
</P>
<P>
   The generic drug scandal of 1989 shook public confidence in the
FDA.
</P>
<P>
   Some generic drug companies gave the FDA false data to win
approval for their products and offered illegal gratuities to FDA
employees. As a result, more than 200 products were removed from
the market, 36 generic drug makers were investigated, nine were
referred to federal grand juries, and five high-ranking FDA
employees, including Marvin Seife, once director of the agency's
generic drug division, lost their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   No actual health threats were found, but officials involved were
referred to the Justice Department and charged with fraud and
reckless disregard for the health of consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Then-commissioner Dr. Frank E. Young pledged to strengthen the
drug review system with a ``trust-but-verify approach.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, in a letter to health care practitioners
nationwide, Nightingale assured that any FDA-approved brand-name
drug can be interchanged with any FDA-approved therapeutically
equivalent generic product.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   9. One factor influencing Texas doctors to accept generics is a
managed care system that emphasizes cutting costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Managed care has forced them (doctors) to change,'' Shepherd
says.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, 71 percent of HMOs now require generic substitution
whenever possible, he says. When insurance companies will cover the
brand names, the patient's co-pay is higher _ often two or three
times higher.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   10. There are certain classes of drugs that many physicians and
pharmacists believe should not be substituted, even when a generic
is available. A Fort Worth allergist and member of the American
Medical Association's House of Delegates, points to theophyline, as
an example.
</P>
<P>
   The widely used oral asthma medication is manufactured under
many brand names as well as generic, but, someone doing well under
one brand should not be switched, Wynn says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theophyline has been around for decades, and molecule by
molecule, there shouldn't be any differences,'' she acknowledges.
``But, it is chemically related to caffeine and can have the same
side effects _ stomach aches, central nervous system disorders,
even seizures and comas. The generic theophylines are not as free
of side effects or as predictable. Absorption and blood-serum
levels may be eratic even though it's the exact same medication in
the exact same dose. I was taught in training never to substitute
theophyline. Most allergists will not allow generic substitution
for that drug,'' she says.

CHINA EVADES U.N CENSURE ON HUMAN RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ China once again evaded international censure of its
human rights record when it won a preemptive procedural maneuver on
Tuesday to block debate by the United Nations' main rights forum.
</P>
<P>
   Splitting 22-18, with 12 countries abstaining, the member
countries of the U.N. Human Rights Commission rejected an attempt
to bring China to account for what the Clinton administration says
is a deteriorating human rights climate for political dissenters,
practitioners of the Falun Gong spiritual movement, unregistered
churches, Internet users, ethnic minorities and disfavored
academics and journalists.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate vote, Cuba was criticized for its rights
practices, particularly repression of political opposition and
detention of dissidents. The tally was 21 countries voting for the
resolution, 18 against and 14 abstaining. Although European
countries backed the resolution fielded by the Czech Republic and
Poland and co-sponsored by the United States, they noted that the
measure ignored the negative effects the American economic embargo
has had on Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban shipwreck
survivor, did not appear to sway votes despite Havana's charge it
showed the hypocrisy of U.S. accusations against it. Two more
countries voted for the anti-Cuba resolution this year than in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   The votes were among those taken by the 53-country commission,
which meets in Geneva for six weeks annually, to review the prior
year's performance by some of the world's worst human rights
offenders. This year, the body also criticized Yugoslavia for its
repression of media and political foes, Myanmar for using forced
labor, and Iraq for executions and torture, among others. The
question of Russian atrocities in Chechnya has been delayed until
next week to see if a compromise can be reached.
</P>
<P>
   While commission censure incurs no penalties, most nations seek
to avoid such unfavorable international scrutiny. China is chief
among them, and has used a procedural maneuver to avoid
full-fledged examination of its human rights practices. This has
worked all but one year since resolutions began to be lodged at the
commission following the 1989 killings of protestors at Tiananmen
Square.
</P>
<P>
   If a no-action motion passes, there is no further discussion of
a country's record. In 1995, the effort against China passed the
first hurdle, but commission members then voted against rebuking
the country.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. arguments that China's rights situation had worsened in the
past year found little support among African and Asian countries,
some of which have questionable histories of treating their own
citizens. Countries, including Pakistan, Russia, Cuba, India and
Sudan, lined up behind Chinese envoy Qiao Zonghuai who declared the
U.S. effort was ``nothing but an anti-China political farce
directed and played all by the United States alone,'' and labeled
``a blatant lie'' the American contention that China's rights
situation had seriously worsened.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the vote, both sides lobbied extensively to sway a
half-dozen uncommitted countries. Chinese officials traveled to
various capitals, and kept up a barrage against the ``evil cult''
of Falun Gong. Hundreds of human rights dissidents and supporters
poured into Geneva, with colorfully garbed Tibetans demonstrating
against Beijing's policies.
</P>
<P>
   Some rights campaigners said they thought the European Union's
tepid backing had sunk the U.S. effort. The 15-country EU had been
unable to agree on a common position and individual countries were
worried over the possibility of commercial retaliation by the
Chinese, according to several people following the commission. In
an unusual development, Romania's delegation left the room during
the China vote.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The resolution's prospects this year also were seriously
weakened because many countries saw it as a sop to U.S. domestic
interests opposing China's entry in the World Trade Organization.
China's ally, Pakistan addressed the issue directly, declaring it
opposed the United States bringing ``domestic political horse
trading into'' the commission.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Hongju Koh, U.S. assistant secretary of state, said
Washington expected China would ``play by the world's trading
rules'' if it enters the WTO, just as it should ``play by the
world's human rights rules.''
</P>
<P>
   He was particularly critical of the no-action motion as China's
attempt ``to exempt itself from its obligations to uphold
international norms and standards.'' Following the vote, he said
that ``China's invincibility has been pierced. The notion that they
can regularly put up a no-action motion has been called into
question,'' because the winning margin has been narrowed to four
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to China's assertions, Washington's resolution is not
confrontation, Koh insisted. ``When a government consistently
confronts its own people and denies them basic human rights, it is
our duty, as commission members, to speak up for the rights of
these people to believe, worship, speak, work and assemble without
government repression.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By sponsoring a resolution on China,'' he argued, ``we have
helped draw the attention fo the world and the Chinese authorities
themselves to China's poor human rights record, and the plight of
the Chinese people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One rights official noted that the U.S. effort ``was awkward but
necessary to deal with the human rights of one-fifth of the world's
population.''

OVER-THE-COUNTER GENERICS
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanies GENERIC DRUGS) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most popular over-the-counter drugs are available today as house
brands at major drug chains, such as Eckerd, Walgreen and Drug
Emporium, and mass merchandisers such as Wal-Mart and Target.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration evaluates nonprescription
``copy cat'' drugs in the same way it does prescription generics,
that is, they must be ``bioequivalent'' to the name brand.
</P>
<P>
   The generic drug's labeling must contain information that is
essentially the same as that of the approved name-brand drug, and
the manufacturer must show that its generic drug is stable under
extremes of heat and humidity before it can be sold.
</P>
<P>
   Selecting a house brand or other generic equivalent can save
money over brand names and work just as well.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a bottle of 100 name-brand Tylenol recently was
selling for $8.99 at Eckerd Drug while Eckerd's own brand of
acetaminophen runs $6.99 for 100, Drug Emporium's regular price for
its own brand is $1.99 for 100, while Tylenol runs $7.67. At
Target, Tylenol was selling at $6.49 for 100, while the comparable
Target brand was $4.89.
</P>
<P>
   Similar savings are available on store brands of other popular
pain relievers, antihistamines, decongestants, antacids, vitamins,
cough suppressants and stomach-acid reducers.
</P>
<P>
   Check the labels to compare indications for use, warnings and
both active and inactive ingredients.

WHEN GENERIC SUBSTITUTION MAY NOT BE THE RIGHT THING TO DO
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanies GENERIC DRUGS) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration stands by any and all of
the generic equivalents it approves and says there are no
documented examples of a generic product manufactured to meet its
approved specifications that could not be used interchangeably with
the corresponding brand-name drug.
</P>
<P>
   However, many doctors, including those responsible for The Merck
Manual, the most widely used medical reference in the world, say
generic substitutes should not be used in some cases, especially
when there is a ``very narrow therapeutic index.'' With these
drugs, there is very little difference between a therapeutic dose
and a dangerous overdose or underdose.
</P>
<P>
   For some drugs, especially those taken for congestive heart
failure, asthma, epilepsy or psychosis and some high blood pressure
and diabetes drugs, patients should consult their physicians before
substituting a generic for a brand-name version.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't that these generics are bad. They can be perfectly
fine, and most of the time, they are,'' says Dr. Robert Berkow,
editor of the Merck Manual. ``But, for a drug like theophyline and
some of the hormone formulations and heart drugs, we recommend
against switching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hormone preparations all work, but if you are taking one and
you like the way it is working for you, whether it's generic or
brand name, I wouldn't want you to switch. A very tiny difference
could be a problem. The drug itself may be equivalent, but pressed
into a tablet, it may not be so equivalent. It's not always a
question of one being better than the other, but of changing from
one to another.''
</P>
<P>
   For long-lasting potassium supplements, Berkow says doctors
recommend against generics sold in tablet form, but capsules may be
freely substituted. It seems that some generic potassium tablets
are so compressed they do not dissolve quickly enough to be
absorbed fully.
</P>
<P>
   In another example, Berkow says that when he prescribes warfarin
(to prevent blood clotting) he has a good idea of how the brand he
prescribes is going to work, so he wouldn't want patients to take a
generic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want anybody switching it to another preparation
because the range of safety is too narrow. It may lose its effects
and you end up with a blood clot or it may be too effective, and
you end up with uncontrolled bleeding,'' Berkow says.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer prescriptions are written ``DAW,'' (dispense as written)
today, but when they are, there is usually good reason, says Dr.
Marvin Shepherd of the University of Texas College of Pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   Digoxin, a heart medicine, is almost always prescribed under the
brand name, Lanoxin, for example, because so many people have used
it under that brand name for so long, and doctors know it is very
dependable and predictable.
</P>
<P>
   In a reversal of their usual policy, some HMOs refuse to cover
the cost of generic digoxin.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a heart medicine that works for you, you don't
want to change it,'' says Shepherd. ``It is an inexpensive drug
that costs about $8 a month for the brand-name. Why would anyone
want to change to the generic?''

 &HT;    GROUP RALLIES TO PUBLICIZE RACE BIAS SUIT AGAINST COCA-COLA
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ISMAIL TURAY Jr.
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Chanting slogans of outrage, nearly 50 current and
former Coca-Cola employees held a rally Tuesday on Capitol Hill to
publicize a discrimination lawsuit against the company and pressure
Coke officials to settle the suit quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The event was part of a five-day, four-city ``Ride for Corporate
Justice'' tour that is also aimed at raising public awareness of
racial discrimination at the Coca-Cola Co. and calling for an end
to employment discrimination in corporate America, said the
organizers, the Atlanta-based Committee for Corporate Justice.
</P>
<P>
   The federal lawsuit, filed by eight current and former
employees, alleges that Coca-Cola has discriminated against blacks
in pay and promotions. The plaintiffs are seeking class-action
status so they can represent about 2,000 current and former black
Coke employees in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The company has denied the allegations and has fought efforts to
make the suit a class-action case. Phone calls to Coke headquarters
were not returned Tuesday, but company spokesman Ben Deutsch said
Saturday, ``We continue to work towards a quick and equitable
resolution of the lawsuit.'' Black employees at Coke earn an
average $27,000 less than their white counterparts in the same
positions, Larry Jones told fellow protesters wearing red hats with
buttons reading ``Justice Riders.''
</P>
<P>
   Just before Jones spoke, the group thundered, ``What do we want?
Justice! From who? Coca-Cola!''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are tired of the deception, and I would like to challenge
(Coke CEO Douglas Daft) to prove to us that those problems don't
exist,'' Jones said, waving a 20-ounce bottle of Coca-Cola in the
air.
</P>
<P>
   Jones referred to Coca-Cola layoffs a few months ago as ``ethnic
cleansing,'' saying it was likely that a majority of those losing
their jobs were black.
</P>
<P>
   Former Coke employee Angela Graham told the rally that despite
her excellent performance record, she was passed over for promotion
several times while less-qualified whites were promoted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad thing about all this is that you come in the company
with a lot of hope,'' said Graham, who left the company in January
after three years' employment. But ``before I let Coca-Cola or any
company in corporate America oppress my people, I will die and go
to my grave first.''
</P>
<P>
   Several times in his speech, Jones alluded to a boycott of Coke
products, but said the group would use every option available to
avoid one. But he said that if nothing is resolved at Coke's annual
shareholder's meeting in Wilmington, Del., on Wednesday, he could
call for a boycott.
</P>
<P>
   The rally in a House hearing room was the group's only event in

DON'T CRY: IT'S JUST AN ONION  
 A NUT IN NAME ONLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Dining)  
 By MELISSA CLARK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (italics)Last week's Food Chain column discussed ways to chop
onions without tears. It suggested that to reduce the eye
irritation caused when allicin, a volatile substance, is released
from the onion, cooks should wear protective eyewear, do their
chopping under running water or chill the onion first. Readers had
a few other suggestions.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is another method for reducing crying while cutting
onions. You hinted at in in your answer. The goal is to prevent
cutting the cell structure and having the juices or vapor from the
onion get into your eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Use a very sharp knife and slice the onion by sawing, so that
you don't crush the cells and cause the liquid in the onion to
spray. Don't chop as if chopping a log. A sharp knife will make it
unnecessary to push hard. It works. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (italics)Two readers had the same idea:(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I've found munching on a piece of bread or cracker does wonders.
But I have no idea why! &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cut off about an eighth of a slice of bread and place it on the
roof of your mouth. It does the trick, although if you are chopping
a lot of onions, you may have to change the bread. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (italics)The food scientist and author Harold McGee hypothesized
why the bread trick might work.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're holding something in your mouth, you won't be
inhaling that way, so you might take in slightly less of the onion
fumes,'' he said. But he noted that most of the irritation comes
from your eyes making direct contact with the fumes, not from
inhaling them. McGee recommends either chilling the onions or
blocking the fumes with glasses.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is an easy, successful method I have used for many years.
I do my chopping on the back part of the stove-top with the exhaust
fan running. No fumes, no tears. The only requirement is an exhaust
fan! &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Several members of my family suffer from nut allergies.
Recently, we were preparing a recipe that called for water chestnut
flour. Is the water chestnut actually a member of the nut family?
</P>
<P>
   A. Despite their name, water chestnuts are not related to nuts.
Technically, they are corms, or fleshy underground stems, of the
water chestnut plant (Trapa natans), which grows along the muddy
edges of ponds and lakes, or in flooded fields. When raw, water
chestnuts have a juicy-crisp texture that is somewhat like
jicama's.
</P>
<P>
   Cooked, the flesh softens around the outside but still retains
that characteristic crunch within. Water chestnuts can also be
dried and ground into a starchy flour, which is much like arrowroot
starch. In fact, arrowroot starch, available in most health food
stores, makes a good substitute for water chestnut flour, which can
be difficult to find.

 &HT;    GROUP RALLIES TO PUBLICIZE RACE BIAS SUIT AGAINST COCA-COLA
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ISMAIL TURAY Jr.
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Chanting slogans of outrage, nearly 50 current and
former Coca-Cola employees held a rally Tuesday on Capitol Hill to
publicize a discrimination lawsuit against the company and pressure
Coke officials to settle the suit quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The event was part of a five-day, four-city ``Ride for Corporate
Justice'' tour that is also aimed at raising public awareness of
racial discrimination at the Coca-Cola Co. and calling for an end
to employment discrimination in corporate America, said the
organizers, the Atlanta-based Committee for Corporate Justice.
</P>
<P>
   The federal lawsuit, filed by eight current and former
employees, alleges that Coca-Cola has discriminated against blacks
in pay and promotions. The plaintiffs are seeking class-action
status so they can represent about 2,000 current and former black
Coke employees in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The company has denied the allegations and has fought efforts to
make the suit a class-action case. Phone calls to Coke headquarters
were not returned Tuesday, but company spokesman Ben Deutsch said
Saturday, ``We continue to work towards a quick and equitable
resolution of the lawsuit.'' Black employees at Coke earn an
average $27,000 less than their white counterparts in the same
positions, Larry Jones told fellow protesters wearing red hats with
buttons reading ``Justice Riders.''
</P>
<P>
   Just before Jones spoke, the group thundered, ``What do we want?
Justice! From who? Coca-Cola!''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are tired of the deception, and I would like to challenge
(Coke CEO Douglas Daft) to prove to us that those problems don't
exist,'' Jones said, waving a 20-ounce bottle of Coca-Cola in the
air.
</P>
<P>
   Jones referred to Coca-Cola layoffs a few months ago as ``ethnic
cleansing,'' saying it was likely that a majority of those losing
their jobs were black.
</P>
<P>
   Former Coke employee Angela Graham told the rally that despite
her excellent performance record, she was passed over for promotion
several times while less-qualified whites were promoted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad thing about all this is that you come in the company
with a lot of hope,'' said Graham, who left the company in January
after three years' employment. But ``before I let Coca-Cola or any
company in corporate America oppress my people, I will die and go
to my grave first.''
</P>
<P>
   Several times in his speech, Jones alluded to a boycott of Coke
products, but said the group would use every option available to
avoid one. But he said that if nothing is resolved at Coke's annual
shareholder's meeting in Wilmington, Del., on Wednesday, he could
call for a boycott.
</P>
<P>
   The rally in a House hearing room was the group's only event in
the capital.
</P>
<P>
   The rolling protest started started in Decatur, Ga., on Saturday
and made stops for rallies in Greensboro, N.C., and Richmond, Va.,
before coming to Washington. The ride will end at the shareholders
meeting, which protesters plan to attend along with the Rev. Jesse
Jackson.

<P>
   LATROBE, Pa. _ Among golfers, this town of 10,000 about an
hour's drive east of Pittsburgh is known for Arnold Palmer, who was
born here. Among beer drinkers, it is known for Rolling Rock, the
malty lager in the long-neck green bottles, which is brewed here.
Among serious sundae scholars, all three of them, it is known as
the birthplace of the banana split.
</P>
<P>
   But among committed cooks, it is known for Jamison Farm, between
Latrobe and Crabtree, which produces some of the nation's best lamb
_ firm yet tender, younger, paler and tastier than supermarket
lamb.
</P>
<P>
   Like his father, John Jamison used to make his living selling
what lies beneath the gently rolling foothills of the Allegheny
Mountains here in Westmoreland County: bituminous coal. Now, he and
his wife, Sukey, make their living from the bluegrass that covers
the hillsides of their 210-acre farm. Their sheep and lambs, 300 to
500 at any one time, are raised almost entirely on that grass,
instead of the grain used by big feedlots.
</P>
<P>
   Lamb is a great favorite in Europe. Springtime abbacchio is
beloved of Romans; Romney Marsh lamb and agneau pre-sale come from
animals raised near the English Channel in England and France;
Sisteron lamb is raised in Provence, and those blessed with palates
more exquisite than mine detect hints of wild thyme and rosemary in
it; Pauillac lamb makes a perfect foil for the great Pauillac wines
like Chateau Latour.
</P>
<P>
   But it is no big deal in the United States. The average American
eats only a pound of lamb a year, according to the American Sheep
Industry Association in Englewood, Colo., compared with 66 pounds
of beef.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the year, American lamb goes mainly to chefs and to home
cooks with roots in Greece, Ireland and other countries that eat a
lot of lamb. The exception is the Easter season. An ancient symbol
of rebirth, the sacrifice of a lamb is a springtime Christian
ritual shared with other religions, including Judaism and Islam. In
a modified form, it has survived into this secular age.
</P>
<P>
   My wife, Betsey, grew up in a house where lamb chops were a
weekly staple (with mint jelly, of course), and to this day she
orders them instead of beef at steakhouses. I would never pass up a
New York sirloin.
</P>
<P>
   But we find common ground on the Easter menu: always a leg of
lamb, roasted rare with garlic and rosemary, carved into long, thin
slices in the French style and served with a bubbling potato
gratin. Plus local asparagus, if the spring is warm enough or if
Easter falls late enough.
</P>
<P>
   Befores and afters are subject to arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   At our house, at least, the Easter feast has four virtues:
</P>
<P>
   1) It tastes gloriously fresh, rich and herby. 2) Like tulips
and income-tax forms and daylight saving time, it reassures us that
we have all made it through another winter. 3) It all but demands
the grandest, dustiest bottle of claret in the cellar. And 4) It
gives the old man a chance to show off his nifty manche a gigot, an
antique French gadget that looks like a medieval torture
instrument; a gift from my chum, Morley Safer, another lamb lover,
it clamps on to the protruding shank bone and makes carving a
cinch.
</P>
<P>
   The Jamisons' is no mom-and-pop operation. They slaughter
between 4,000 and 5,000 animals a year, which means, at an average
weight of about 40 pounds a head, that they are producing 80 to 100
tons of lamb a year _ a far cry from their halting beginnings in
1976. They started with six sheep in the lyrically named township
of Pleasant Unity, not far from Latrobe, hoping to sell the wool.
That didn't work, so they switched from wool to meat and moved in
1985, with a flock grown to 200 sheep, to their present home, a
modest white frame building that dates from the early 1870s.
</P>
<P>
   John Mr. Jamison, a burly, cheery 53-year-old, and Sukey
Jamison, fit and lanky at 51, met in high school and attended
Washington and Jefferson College in Washington, Pa., together. They
migrated gradually to the countryside, opting for full-time farm
life when the coal trade turned sour. They picked up much of what
they know about lamb from county extension agents and their
children's 4-H Club friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know which end of the animal we were supposed to
feed,'' Jamison confided over a hearty kitchen-table lunch of
braised lamb shanks, claret and Mrs. Jamison's home-baked bread and
brownies.
</P>
<P>
   It was much worse than that, countered Mrs. Jamison: ``We didn't
know anything about anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on, John Jamison discovered the writings of Louis
Bromfield. A novelist who lived in France between the world wars,
he returned to Mansfield, Ohio, where he was born, to turn a
worn-out tract of land into Malabar Farm, a showplace that was
nationally known in the 1940s. Bromfield described grass as ``the
great healer,'' and Jamison adopted him as a hero.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the Jamisons heard about a method of rearing lambs
that had been developed in France by a scientist named Andre
Voisin. Called ``intensive rotational grazing,'' it is an
agricultural perpetual motion machine that makes grazing
economically and environmentally viable. It is also one of the
major things that sets Jamison lamb apart.
</P>
<P>
   The Jamisons buy 8- to 12-week-old lambs from local farmers
(they are rebuilding their flock of ewes, but even with 600 ewes,
they would produce only 900 lambs a year, not enough for their
needs). The lambs are a cross between English breeds, Suffolks and
black-faced Hampshires, raised for their meat, and smaller,
white-faced Dorsets, well adapted to the grass here.
</P>
<P>
   For roughly nine months a year, the Jamisons' animals eat
nothing but grass. They are moved every day or two, with the help
of Border collies, from one enclosure to another. When they go into
a paddock or pasture, the grass there is four to eight inches tall;
when they leave, John Jamison said, pointing to the tile floor in
the kitchen, ``it's like that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do they all eat all day long?'' Betsey wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what they do for a living,'' Jamison said. ``We raise
grass. The lambs harvest it.''
</P>
<P>
   The genius of the system is this: in nibbling the grass down to
a nub, the sheep expose the white clover underneath. A legume, the
clover helps to build up the nitrogen level in the soil, greatly
enriching it. That, plus sheep droppings, makes the grass grow
back, and after three weeks or so, the cycle can begin again.
</P>
<P>
   (As long ago as the farm depression of the early 1920s, I
learned from ``American Dreamer,'' a new biography of the farm
editor and politician Henry A. Wallace, he was urging Iowa farmers
to plant crops of clover.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only in deepest winter are the lambs hand-fed, mostly with hay
and corn raised without chemicals. Jamison Farm itself uses no
herbicides or pesticides, and the animals get no hormones or
antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Slaughtered when three to six months old, later than European
milk-fed lambs but much earlier than many American lambs, which are
sometimes almost a year old, the Jamison animals yield meat that
looks faintly pink, more like veal than most lamb. Because the
animals move around so much, their muscles are better toned, like
an athlete's, which makes the meat lean but not the slightest bit
chewy, at least in the samples that we tasted.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, to make sure that their lambs were killed
properly and the carcasses chilled slowly, to avoid toughening
them, the Jamisons bought their own processing plant on the other
side of Latrobe. A crew of three runs it. But Jamison, who looks
every bit the gentleman farmer in his brown suede shoes and bib
overalls, puts on a rubber apron and pitches in on the messy jobs
of bleeding and skinning the animals when needed.
</P>
<P>
   The Jamisons' big break came almost by chance, when the
French-born chef Jean-Louis Palladin, then in Washington, tasted
their lamb in 1987. His palate pleased, he eventually spread the
word to French colleagues also based in the United States,
including Jean-Georges Vongerichten and Daniel Boulud in New York.
From there, it was mostly easy going; recently I spotted Jamison
lamb on the menu at Tru, Chicago's hot new restaurant, and
restaurants at Disney World and in Las Vegas are among the best
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Other high-quality lamb is produced in Sonoma County, Calif., in
Colorado and in Virginia, where Jamie Nicoll of Summerfield Farm,
near Culpeper, produces both premium lamb and veal. Bruce Aidells,
author of ``The Complete Meat Cookbook'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1998),
said he considered the Jamisons and Nicoll the top American
producers. Among imports, he praised Australian lamb brought in
fresh by Superior Farms of Dixon, Calif., which also sells American
lamb, in preference to frozen New Zealand lamb.
</P>
<P>
   But none of their competitors have gained quite the following
among chefs the Jamisons have.
</P>
<P>
   That may be because of the mild flavor and smell of Jamison
lamb. Many Americans find the aroma of roasting lamb unattractive,
often because it is too fatty or has been cooked too long, or both,
and describe the taste as oily or greasy, which Jamison attributes
to corn feeding.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the Jamisons' production goes to restaurants. The
rest is sold directly to the public, by way of a toll-free
telephone number (800-237-5262), a fax number (724-837-2287) or the
Internet (www.jamisonfarm.com). It isn't cheap. Two racks cost $88,
two legs $78, a dozen loin chops $78. But a whole lamb, cut to
order, is a better deal at $205. Most of the items can be ordered
either fresh or frozen.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to doing much of the work with the lambs in the
pastures and paddocks, Mrs. Jamison is a talented cook whose
farmhouse kitchen shelters a huge South Bend stove, and she has
developed a range of prepared lamb dishes, some in cooperation with
Palladin. They include stews, soups, sausages and absolutely
delectable lamb pies, which are also for sale.
</P>
<P>
   By now the Jamisons are steeped in lamb lore. For decades I have
used the word ``bellwether'' in political stories to describe a
precinct or county that tends to vote the same way as a larger
entity, like a city or state. I had no clue where the word came
from. John Jamison told me. A ``wether'' is a castrated ram, he
explained, and a ``bellwether'' is a wether wearing a bell, which
leads the flock.
</P>
<P>
   The two are also full of stories, some funny, that illustrate
how wide the knowledge gap between producers and consumers of
foodstuffs has become in the modern world. A California woman asked
Jamison on the phone, he said, what the difference was between veal
and lamb; she seemed unsatisfied when he replied, ``Well, one of
them goes `moo' and the other `baa.''' Another potential customer,
a tender heart, wanted to know whether she could get lamb chops
without causing a lamb to lose its life.
</P>
<P>
   On the wall of the Jamisons' kitchen hangs a picture of the two
of them with the actress Jodie Foster. We spotted it on the way
out, and Mrs. Jamison told us with a hint of self-mockery, ``We
supplied the lambs for `The Silence of the Lambs.'''

   1 tablespoon paprika
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon tumeric.
</P>
<P>
   1. Prepare marinade: In a large bowl, combine all ingredients
for marinade except lamb chops. Add chops and coat well. Cover and
refrigerate for 3 to 8 hours. Allow chops to come to room
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   2. Prepare cauliflower puree: In a medium saucepan, combine
cauliflower florets and 6 tablespoons butter. Cover and place over
low heat. Steam until cauliflower is tender, about 15 minutes. Heat
cream until hot but not boiling, and add to cauliflower. Using an
immersion blender or food processor, puree cauliflower mixture
until very smooth. Season with salt and pepper and keep warm.

<P>
   4. Prepare chops: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place a large
seasoned or nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Remove chops
from marinade, and pat dry with paper towels. Add chops to pan and
sear well. Transfer to a large bowl. Add mustard, and turn chops
until coated. In a food processor, process brioche to obtain 2 cups
of fine crumbs. Transfer to a large bowl and set aside. In food
processor, chop lemongrass pieces until minced. Add kaffir lime
leaves, garlic and ginger and mince. Add cilantro, mint, paprika
and tumeric and mince. Transfer mixture to bowl of brioche crumbs,
and blend well.
</P>
<P>
   5. Pat a light coating of crumb mixture on chops (do not dredge
chops or coating will be too thick) and place chops on a baking
sheet. Roast according to taste, using an instant-read thermometer
to test center of each chop: 140 degrees for medium-rare chops with
a lightly browned crust.
</P>
<P>
   6. To serve, divide Swiss chard among four plates. Top chard
with two chops per plate. Add a portion of cauliflower to each
plate. Serve immediately.

<P>
   Someone once asked Harry Waugh, the English wine merchant,
writer and director of Chateau Latour, if he had ever mistaken a
Burgundy for a Bordeaux.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not since lunch,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   I console myself with Harry's words when I confuse a California
merlot with a California cabernet in a blind tasting. I'm not
alone. Even skilled winemakers mix them up.
</P>
<P>
   Merlot, the red grape of the moment, was once seen as mostly a
blending grape. In the last decade, it became a popular solo act,
an alternative to cabernet sauvignon. Cabernet is described as
lean, austere, angular and astringent, with lots of tannin. Merlot
is softer, fleshier, rounder and easier to drink.
</P>
<P>
   Winemakers add merlot to cabernet ``to soften it up a bit.''
They add cabernet to merlot ``to give it structure, or backbone.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder that red wine fans often ask themselves: ``Is
this a rounded, softer cabernet or a drier, tannic merlot?'' In the
final analysis, California cabernet sauvignon and California merlot
have so much in common that it is not easy to tell them apart, even
unblended.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for all of merlot's inroads in the United States, it is a
pallid bit player here, compared with the flamboyant star that
merlot is in France, from Petrus on down.
</P>
<P>
   Merlot as a varietal has been on the market since the late
1960s. In the '70s, when Napa Valley wineries like Duckhorn began
making it an alternative to cabernet sauvignon, it took off. It
appealed to wine buyers intent on staying ahead of the crowd, part
of which was moving into red wine and asking for cabernet. The wine
industry is ever on the lookout for a new favorite. In the late
1980s, merlot filled the bill perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   Merlot grows all over the world. Italy, Eastern Europe, Chile,
Australia and New Zealand all make some wine with it, usually
without much distinction. It is in France, and specifically in
Bordeaux, however, that the grape comes truly into its own.
</P>
<P>
   More than twice as much merlot as cabernet sauvignon is planted
in Bordeaux. Just as in California, it is widely used to make
cabernet more accessible. It is an important component in almost
every great Bordeaux wine, including the five First Growths:
Haut-Brion, Latour, Lafite-Rothschild, Mouton-Rothschild and
Margaux.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Bordeaux region of St.-Emilion and Pomerol, merlot is
something more. The best wines of Pomerol are almost all merlot.
Chateau Petrus, often considered the finest of Bordeaux, is
normally 92 percent to 95 percent merlot. The fabled Chateau Le Pin
is usually 95 percent merlot, Clinet is 80 percent, La Conseillante
70 percent and Vieux Chateau Certan about 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A bottle of decade-old Petrus can cost $375 to $1,550 in New
York, depending on the vintage. Bottles from chateaus like La
Conseillante, Vieux Chateau Certan and Le Pin all sell for more
than $100. This is because of location and has little to do with
the merlot grape. Merlots or wines that are predominantly merlot
from vineyards in Fronsac and Lalande-de-Pomerol sell for as little
as $20. Location, location, location.
</P>
<P>
   One explanation of the fame of Petrus goes back to the 1950s,
when an importer holding much of the Petrus in the United States
made a big sale of it to Henri Soule, owner of Le Pavillon, then
the reigning French restaurant in New York. Soule convinced diners
that Petrus was the Bordeaux to drink, and the wine has been
popular ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The wines of Pomerol differ widely in style, but all have
elegance combined with concentrated fruit and a soft, almost
velvety texture, which is why Pomerol is sometimes called the
Burgundy of Bordeaux.
</P>
<P>
   To say that the wines of neighboring St.-Emilion are closer in
style to Medoc oversimplifies, because there are separate styles
within St.-Emilion. Generally, however, St.-Emilions are more
structured and less opulent than Pomerols.
</P>
<P>
   The wine of Chateau Troplong-Mondot, a Grand Cru Classe, is
usually about 80 percent merlot; Magdelaine is 90 percent;
Grand-Mayne, 70 percent; La Gaffeliere, 65 percent; and l'Angelus
and Ausone, both about 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   No one who has ever drunk more than a few bottles of Bordeaux
will ever confuse these wines with the cabernet-dominant wines of
Medoc. Why? Because of terroir, that elusive word, which seems to
combine the importance of the soil and weather.
</P>
<P>
   Merlot is first mentioned in the records of Pomerol and
St.-Emilion in the 18th century, so the growers there have had at
least 200 years to seek out the best combinations of land and
vines. The soils of Pomerol are different from those of
St.-Emilion, and those of Petrus are different from the rest of
Pomerol.
</P>
<P>
   The Petrus vineyards form a small island of clay in the center
of a small sea of gravel, the predominant soil of the surrounding
vineyards. Much of St.-Emilion is on limestone, but in parts there
are clay, sand and gravel.
</P>
<P>
   For years, California winemakers played down the importance of
terroir, maintaining that the weather _ the heat, rainfall and
sunlight _ mattered most for grape growing. That attitude has
changed, notably since the phylloxera epidemic of the 1980s and
early '90s provided an opportunity to replant thousands of acres of
prime California vineyard land.
</P>
<P>
   There are California merlots that are not just softer cabernets.
Matanzas Creek, Duckhorn, Newton, Ravenswood and Shafer come to
mind. Washington State also has good choices. Its red wines, both
cabernet and merlot, can be leaner, more elegant, more Bordeauxlike
than California's. Washington merlots worth sampling include Andrew
Hill, Canoe Ridge, Columbia Crest, Seven Hills and L'Ecole No. 41.
</P>
<P>
   Among Bordeaux, lesser appellations in and around Pomerol and
St.-Emilion are merlot-based and affordable. Lalande-de-Pomerol,
which adjoins Pomerol, produces creditable Pomerol-style wines.
</P>
<P>
   Wines from chateaus like Belles-Graves, Les Templiers, Chambran
and Bertineau, which is owned by the enologist Michel Rolland, are
worth hunting down. Chateau Puygueraud, in the Cotes de Francs, is
owned by the Thienponts, who own Le Pin and Vieux Chateau Certan.
It often shows up in serious wine shops.
</P>
<P>
   While Petrus is inaccessible to the average buyer, the winery is
owned by the Moueix family, which owns many properties in the
region. I am partial to wines from the family's smaller places in
Fronsac and Canon-Fronsac, like La Croix, Canon Moueix (usually
more than 90 percent merlot) and La Croix-Canon.
</P>
<P>
   None of the French properties mention grape contents on their
labels. One day, perhaps, Americans will move beyond varietal
labeling.
</P>
<P>
   But if a wine comes from a good place and is made by someone I
respect, I don't care what grapes are in it.

A HAM WITH AN ELEMENT OF SURPRISE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN WILLOUGHBY and CHRIS SCHLESINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like actors, foods can become typecast, so closely identified
with a particular approach that we never think of them any other
way. Often, though, an unrecognized but exciting player lurks
behind the familiar guise.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly enough, in the pork department this role is occupied
by ham. Everybody recognizes it. It is the hind leg of a hog that
has been cured and often smoked as well, acquiring in the process a
delicate pink hue and a rich flavor strongly underpinned with salt
and smoke.
</P>
<P>
   That's a ham, all right. But so is that same hind leg of pork
uncured and unsmoked. To distinguish it from the cured version, it
has come to be called ``fresh ham,'' and it is a truly wonderful
pork roast. Anyone looking for a new centerpiece for the holiday
table ought to give it a chance.
</P>
<P>
   We first encountered fresh hams when we started attending
barbecue competitions in the South a number of years ago. Along
with pork shoulders, these uncured hams were very popular options
for the long, slow process of smoke roasting that is barbecue. But,
as we found out when we decided to explore further, a fresh ham is
also exceptional when roasted in the oven.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet, tender, juicy and full of pork flavor, it is also quite a
bit less expensive per pound than the more traditional loin roast.
This makes it ideal for big, celebratory dinners. It also has the
added advantage of unfamiliarity, a quality that makes it memorable
to guests.
</P>
<P>
   And you need to have guests, because this is a large roast.
Weighing in the neighborhood of 20 pounds, a whole fresh ham is too
big for all but the largest celebrations, not to mention most home
ovens. A half pork leg is often more appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   You can get either the rump or shank section of the leg, each of
which has its advantages. The rump, or butt half, which is rounded,
has a higher proportion of meat to bone. But we slightly prefer the
somewhat larger shank half, which is tapered, because it is easier
to carve and somewhat leaner.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever end of the leg you buy, make sure it is bone-in and
skin-on. The bone adds considerable flavor, and the crisp skin is
our favorite part of the meal.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the first time we cooked a skin-on fresh ham, we
discovered what is probably the original inspiration for the
somewhat mysterious crisscross pattern that adorns pineapple-topped
cured hams on all those buffet lines and Easter dinner tables.
Making cuts in this way opens up the inside of the ham to whatever
flavored rub or paste you might want to apply, but without forcing
you to take off the tasty skin.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve this useful pattern, take a sharp knife and slash the
skin all over in a crosshatch pattern, cutting just down to the
flesh, but not into it. If you are going to the right depth, the
skin will spread apart a bit as you cut.
</P>
<P>
   Like other large pork roasts, a fresh ham will benefit from
brining. This treatment, lasting only 12 to 24 hours, is a distant
relative of the long brining and curing process that those pink
hams undergo. It is certainly not an essential step, but it's a
good idea if you have the time (and the room in your refrigerator).
</P>
<P>
   During brining, the salt and to a somewhat lesser extent the
sugar penetrate the meat. This causes the meat's proteins to unwind
a bit. As they do, they interlock with one another to form a matrix
that traps moisture inside the meat. As a result, it is juicier and
more tender when it is cooked. With today's leaner pork, that's a
very good thing.
</P>
<P>
   Although fresh hams are beginning to show up more often in
supermarkets, you may well need to make a trip to the butcher shop
to get one. As usual with roasts of this size, it pays to call
several days ahead to make sure you can get it. If the butcher says
he doesn't carry fresh ham, ask him if he has fresh pork leg roast,
an alternative name for this cut that is gaining some ground these
days.
</P>
<P>
   On the off chance that even your butcher can't get you a fresh
ham, you can substitute a Boston butt in this recipe. Since that
shoulder cut typically runs about five pounds, cut the amount of
the spice paste in half, and reduce the time it roasts at the lower
temperature by about one hour.
</P>
<P>
   But we strongly recommend that you search out a fresh ham. Not
only will you be rewarded with a succulent, very flavorful and
relatively inexpensive roast, but you will also have the
satisfaction of releasing the full potential of a role-bound
culinary star.

   MAPLE-GLAZED FRESH HAM WITH RAISIN AND HARD CIDER SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   Time: 2{ to 3 hours; if brining, add 12 to 24 hours  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 cup kosher salt (if brining)
</P>
<P>
   } cup sugar (if brining)
</P>
<P>
   1 8- to 10-pound butt or shank portion fresh ham (half a leg),
skin on
</P>
<P>
   1{ cups raisins
</P>
<P>
   { cup dark rum
</P>
<P>
   1 cup packed dark brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup fresh sage leaves
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons dry mustard
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons finely grated lemon zest (from about 2 lemons)
</P>
<P>
   8 cloves garlic, peeled
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons black peppercorns
</P>
<P>
   1 cup maple syrup
</P>
<P>
   1 liter hard apple cider (or substitute regular apple cider).
</P>
<P>
   1. If brining the ham, combine salt and white sugar with 2
quarts water in a pot large enough to fit the ham comfortably. Stir
well to dissolve. Add ham, cover, and place in refrigerator for 12
to 24 hours. Remove, rinse well, and dry with paper towels.
</P>
<P>
   2. In a small bowl, combine raisins and rum and allow to sit
while ham cooks, at least 2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   3. Preheat oven to 500 degrees. Place brown sugar, sage,
mustard, lemon zest, garlic, salt and peppercorns in a blender or a
food processor fitted with a steel blade, and process until smooth.
</P>
<P>
   4. Using a sharp knife, score entire surface of ham in a
crosshatch pattern, cutting down just through skin to the flesh
underneath. (If you are cutting to the right depth, the skin will
spread apart a bit as you cut.) Rub outside of ham all over with
spice mixture, pressing it gently into crosshatch spaces between
the skin. Put roast on a rack in a large roasting pan and place in
oven.
</P>
<P>
   5. After 20 minutes, reduce oven setting to 300 degrees. After 1
hour, begin painting ham every 15 minutes or so with maple syrup.
Continue roasting until the very center of ham reaches an internal
temperature of 145 degrees, 2 to 2{ hours total cooking time.
(Begin checking at 1{ hours to be sure.) To check for doneness,
insert a meat thermometer into the absolute center of the roast,
let it sit for 5 seconds, then take the reading.
</P>
<P>
   6. While ham is cooking, place cider in a medium saucepan and
bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium high, and
simmer vigorously until liquid is reduced by about half, about 20
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   7. When ham is done, remove it from roasting pan, cover it
loosely with foil, and allow it to rest for 20 to 30 minutes. Tip
roasting pan to the side so you can spoon off all the fat from pan
juices, then place pan on stove over medium-high heat. Add reduced
cider, and bring to a simmer, scraping bottom of pan to free the
browned bits. Skim any film off surface and season liquid as needed
with salt and pepper. Add rum-soaked raisins, along with any
remaining rum, and stir to combine. Pour into a gravy boat.
</P>
<P>
   8. Carve ham into thick slices, drizzle with raisin-cider sauce
and serve, passing remaining sauce separately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 10 to 12 servings.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't say he didn't warn you. On Page 2 of ``The French Laundry
Cookbook,'' Thomas Keller, the author, chef and owner of the Napa
Valley, Calif., restaurant of that name, makes his approach quite
clear: ``Cooking is not about convenience, and it's not about
shortcuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Easy for him to say.
</P>
<P>
   In case you missed the first red flag, Michael Ruhlman, his
co-author, writes on Page 9, ``Most of the recipes are
time-consuming.'' He adds: ``This is not fast food, nor is it
four-star cooking simplified for the home kitchen. It is four-star
cooking, period.''
</P>
<P>
   Having read all that, I would still spend the $50 the book
(published by Artisan) costs, if I enjoyed complex cooking and
didn't have a day job; wanted to impress my friends by leaving the
book on the coffee table; craved its odd bits of information, which
can turn an ordinary dish into an extraordinary one without a lot
of effort; or was as taken by beautiful pictures of food as others
are by beautiful paintings.
</P>
<P>
   What else can account for the three prizes the book received in
this year's International Association of Cooking Professions
contest? It won prizes for a first cookbook, for design and for the
best cookbook of the year. It has also been nominated for two
awards by the James Beard Foundation, which are given in May.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Keller, I have neither the time nor the inclination to
devote an entire weekend to cooking a meal. Having eaten at the
French Laundry, I appreciate his complex cooking and know that I
want to eat it only on very special occasions.
</P>
<P>
   And only when it has been cooked by him.
</P>
<P>
   But after the book's prize-winning streak, I took a closer look.
Obviously, practicality is not a strong point. But as a testament
to the work of one of the best chefs in America and as a piece of
art, it deserves its honors.
</P>
<P>
   So I took the advice of Susie Heller, who tested the recipes.
``If the degree of difficulty of a dish exceeds your desire to make
it, please remember that it's all right to do only part of a
recipe,'' she writes in the book.
</P>
<P>
   So I made only the Parmesan crisps from a heavenly recipe for
over-the-top ``macaroni and cheese,'' which dauntingly calls for
five component dishes to prepare before the final assembly: a
lobster broth, a butter mixture, a coral oil, lobsters and the
crisps. The crisps were delicious, but they might not take as long
to bake as the recipe suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Five dishes are intimidating enough for the average cook, but
hardly as harrowing as the eight dishes that are required to make
Keller's hearts of palm with puree of marrow beans and field
greens.
</P>
<P>
   I also made a risotto with white truffles. Besides lots of fat
(like five tablespoons of butter and three-quarters of a cup of
heavy cream), it calls for three tablespoons of white truffle oil.
The oil, instead of delicately perfuming the dish, overwhelmed it.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the book for what it is, a chef's four-star recipes
without apology, I still have a couple of quibbles.
</P>
<P>
   I don't see any reason to manipulate a sublime piece of cheese
like a fine Brie into something it is not by whipping it, forming
it into quenelles and serving it with a balsamic glaze. Yes, it
tastes wonderful, and so do the other cheeses, but instead of being
the centerpiece of the cheese course, the cheeses become only one
component in a multi-ingredient dish.
</P>
<P>
   And I wish Keller had not titled the chapter that includes
ingredients like tripe and pig's head ``The Importance of Offal.''
It's a bit much.
</P>
<P>
   I will not be doing much cooking from this book, but I have
committed to memory some of Keller's most enlightening tidbits:
</P>
<P>
   Choose oysters with the thickest shells. They have the most
juice.
</P>
<P>
   Buy black truffles when they are in season. Poach them in
mushroom stock and freeze them for later use.
</P>
<P>
   Do not store white truffles in rice: it dries them out. Keep
them in an airtight container wrapped in a moist towel.
</P>
<P>
   If you serve smoked salmon warm, heat it in milk to leach out
the salt while keeping the smoky cured flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Keller produces brilliant food by focusing on certain flavors
and making them more intense. His search for perfection is beyond
most of us, amateur or professional, but for hobbyist cooks, for
those who want to impress their friends and for those who just love
to read cookbooks, this may be $50 well spent.

 &HT;    POLITICAL PLATFORMS BECOMING INTERACTIVE AFFAIRS
 &HT;    Eds: Corrects quote in 3rd graf to ``allows you to craft.''
 &HT;    360&AMP;add. Moving in the (w) Washington and (p) political
categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Internet is breathing new life into political
party platforms, those long, dry-as-dust documents that in the past
often went unread _ even by the presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Al Gore, the prospective Democratic nominee,
launched a plan that lets anybody draft a plank online for the
upcoming party platform. By Tuesday, more than 2,000 people had
done so and received ``personalized'' thank-you letters from Gore
and Joe Andrew, the Democratic national chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of it as the world's best civics lesson, one that allows
you to craft your own manifesto,'' said Joshua King, a spokesman
for Speakout.com, the Web site that cut a deal with the Democrats
to host the novel platform-drafting service.
</P>
<P>
   Speakout.com, a for-profit site which includes both well-known
Democrats and Republicans on its advisory board, also supplies
sophisticated software that lets users easily cut, paste and edit
parts of the 1996 Democratic platform to create their own 2000
version.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nicholson, the Republican national chairman, has bought into
a more modest set of interactive tools from the same site,
including chat rooms, surveys and e-mail messages to candidates and
other political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great initiative,'' said Larry Purpuro, deputy chief of
staff for the Republican National Committee and the party's top
guru for online activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the Web must be a two-way form of communication, and
we hope to have a fully interactive issues forum for voters up on
our site in the near future,'' Purpuro added. It will include a
comparable ability for outsiders to draft GOP platform language, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there's no guarantee that the presidential
candidates or their top political minions will pay attention to the
online submissions before the final handiwork is made public in
August at their national conventions.
</P>
<P>
   But King, a former aide to President Clinton, held out some
hope. ``If they're smart about it,'' he said, ``they'll find some
golden nuggets here and they'll cite them.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Indiana Republicans on Tuesday became the first
statewide group to stage ``high-tech platform hearings'' on its Web
site. Purpuro said other Republican state parties, beginning with
California, will soon follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to adapt to new technology. In this day and age, it's

 &HT;    Eds: Corrects quote in 3rd graf to ``allows you to craft.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Internet is breathing new life into political
party platforms, those long, dry-as-dust documents that in the past
often went unread _ even by the presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Al Gore, the prospective Democratic nominee,
launched a plan that lets anybody draft a plank online for the
upcoming party platform. By Tuesday, more than 2,000 people had
done so and received ``personalized'' thank-you letters from Gore
and Joe Andrew, the Democratic national chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of it as the world's best civics lesson, one that allows
you to craft your own manifesto,'' said Joshua King, a spokesman
for Speakout.com, the Web site that cut a deal with the Democrats
to host the novel platform-drafting service.
</P>
<P>
   Speakout.com, a for-profit site which includes both well-known
Democrats and Republicans on its advisory board, also supplies
sophisticated software that lets users easily cut, paste and edit
parts of the 1996 Democratic platform to create their own 2000
version.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nicholson, the Republican national chairman, has bought into
a more modest set of interactive tools from the same site,
including chat rooms, surveys and e-mail messages to candidates and
other political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great initiative,'' said Larry Purpuro, deputy chief of
staff for the Republican National Committee and the party's top
guru for online activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the Web must be a two-way form of communication, and
we hope to have a fully interactive issues forum for voters up on
our site in the near future,'' Purpuro added. It will include a
comparable ability for outsiders to draft GOP platform language, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there's no guarantee that the presidential
candidates or their top political minions will pay attention to the
online submissions before the final handiwork is made public in
August at their national conventions.
</P>
<P>
   But King, a former aide to President Clinton, held out some
hope. ``If they're smart about it,'' he said, ``they'll find some
golden nuggets here and they'll cite them.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Indiana Republicans on Tuesday became the first
statewide group to stage ``high-tech platform hearings'' on its Web
site. Purpuro said other Republican state parties, beginning with
California, will soon follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to adapt to new technology. In this day and age, it's
quite difficult to get folks to come to a meeting to give their
views,'' said Lisa Kobe, a state party spokesperson in
Indianapolis. ``And, frankly, it's unnecessary,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking input on ``what are the most critical issues to be

PASTA TREATED LIKE A COUSIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Dining)  
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I recently cooked with a friend who had a novel idea
that immediately seemed sensible and appealing: Why not cook pasta
like risotto? Adding broth a bit at a time and stirring frequently
certainly seemed as if it should create a creamy pasta dish in less
time (no waiting for the water to boil).
</P>
<P>
   My one concern was that the starch given off by the pasta, which
is usually poured off with the cooking water, would make the dish
too starchy. But we both realized that it is exactly that
starchiness that gives risotto its texture.
</P>
<P>
   Our first attempt was encouraging if underflavored. We used
gemelli, although we guessed that any cut pasta like penne or
fusilli would work. (Long pasta is far too unwieldy.) It took only
a few more tries to perfect the technique.
</P>
<P>
   Because pasta is so bland _ even more so than rice _ I decided
to brown it first in butter (or oil). As with risotto, high-quality
stock really made a difference. If you're using canned stock,
consider heating it with an onion, a carrot and a garlic clove
before beginning to add it to the pasta.
</P>
<P>
   A good handful of freshly grated Parmesan added at the end
turned out to be essential for creaminess and flavor.
</P>
<P>
   One more step was needed, however: the addition of a vegetable.
Carrots added color and sweetness, but for this version I settled
on asparagus, which is not only in season but also provides
distinctive flavor. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PASTA, RISOTTO STYLE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Total time: 30 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 pound asparagus
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   1 medium onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 pound gemelli
</P>
<P>
   6 to 8 cups good stock, heated
</P>
<P>
   Salt and fresh black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Freshly grated Parmesan. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Break woody ends off asparagus, and peel stalks if desired.
Break or cut off tips, and cut stems into {-inch sections.
</P>
<P>
   2. Put half the butter in a deep 10- or 12-inch skillet or broad
saucepan, and turn heat to medium-high; when butter melts, add
onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and beginning
to brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Add pasta and cook, stirring
occasionally, until it begins to brown, about 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   3. Add a ladleful of stock. As stock is absorbed and pasta
swells, add more stock and continue to stir occasionally, until
pasta is beginning to become tender, about 5 minutes. Add asparagus
stems, and continue to add stock as needed until pasta is just
about done, 5 minutes or so.
</P>
<P>
   4. Add asparagus tips and a little more stock, stirring until
tips are crisp-tender, the pasta is cooked to your liking and the
mixture is moist but not soupy. (Add a little more stock if
necessary.) Season with salt and pepper to taste. Stir in remaining
butter and Parmesan to taste, and serve. Yield: 4 servings.

CHRISTIAN DELOUVRIER: FRESH AND SALTED COD FLOATING UNDER A CLOUD 
</HEADLINE>
   This is the last of eight columns by Christian Delouvrier, the
executive chef at Lespinasse in Manhattan. They have been written
with Melissa Clark. Next week: Wylie Dufresne, the chef and owner
of 71 Clinton Fresh Foods.  
 (editors: recipe at end of article)  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Cod and mashed potatoes are perfectly balanced
partners, each so subtly flavored that one never overshadows the
other. When the cod is fresh, the mild-mannered ingredients enhance
each other. But when the marriage is made with salt cod, in
brandade, the potatoes mellow the briny aggressiveness of the fish.
</P>
<P>
   Both those classic combinations are supremely satisfying, but I
came up with a three-way partnership that takes all the flavors
even further. I spread the creamy brandade on a crouton, which is
how it is typically served in the South of France, and perch the
fresh roasted cod on top. The garlicky brandade acts almost like a
sauce, flavoring the cod with every bite. But then I cover the
whole layering with an airy blanket of foam made from mashed
potatoes and skim milk. Its sweet lightness is a great contrast to
the dense brandade.
</P>
<P>
   My cod with mashed potatoes involves several steps, but none of
them are the slightest bit difficult. The fresh cod is simply
brushed with olive oil and roasted for 10 minutes. The croutons can
be baked and the brandade pureed a few days in advance. And the
foam can be whipped up while the fish is roasting.
</P>
<P>
   The first step in cooking with salt cod is to soak it overnight,
so that it softens and plumps and gives up much of its salt.
Simmering it in whole milk sweetens the flesh of the cod and leaves
it even more tender and flaky.
</P>
<P>
   In the Mediterranean, cooks traditionally make brandade by
pounding salt cod in a mortar with cooked potato, garlic and a
drizzle of olive oil until it homogenizes into a smooth paste. For
the sake of convenience, I use a food processor, being careful not
to overprocess the mixture. The potatoes can go from perfect to
gluey in one pulse.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, potatoes for brandade are boiled, but I bake them,
because they mash up fluffier when they don't absorb liquid.
</P>
<P>
   The only slightly tricky part of this dish is the foam, getting
the balance of potatoes to milk just right so that the flavors come
through and the mixture foams. I use skim milk because the extra
fat in whole milk makes it too heavy to foam, especially once the
potatoes and olive oil are mixed in. The finished dish looks white
on white, and the flavors have the same purity.
</P>
<P>
   ROASTED COD WITH BRANDADE
</P>
<P>
   Time: 2 hours, plus overnight soaking  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3 ounces skinless, center-cut salt cod
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons butter, cut into cubes
</P>
<P>
   2 cups whole milk
</P>
<P>
   4 slices homemade-style white bread, cut into 2{-inch rounds
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 medium Idaho potatoes
</P>
<P>
   2 cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   4 skinless cod fillets (4 ounces each).
</P>
<P>
   2 cups skim milk
</P>
<P>
   1. Rinse salt cod under running water and place in a bowl. Cover
with water and refrigerate overnight. Place half the butter cubes
in freezer.
</P>
<P>
   2. Drain salt cod. Place in a saucepan with whole milk and
simmer over low heat for 1 hour. Drain cod and let cool.
</P>
<P>
   3. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400 degrees. Brush bread rounds on
both sides with 2 tablespoons olive oil. Place on a baking sheet.
Prick potatoes all over with a fork and place next to bread. Bake
bread until toasted, about 7 minutes, turning after 4 minutes.
Transfer to a wire rack to cool. Continue to bake potatoes until
very soft, 40 to 50 minutes. Cool, then peel and lightly crush with
a fork.
</P>
<P>
   4. To make brandade, put drained salt cod, 2 tablespoons olive
oil and garlic in a food processor, and puree. Add 1/3 cup of
crushed potato, and pulse until mixture is just smooth, taking care
not to overprocess. Put half the remaining potatoes in a small
saucepan with the unfrozen 2 tablespoons butter. Heat, stirring
gently, until butter is melted and potatoes are hot. Mix in
brandade, taste, and add more salt if necessary. Cover and keep
warm.
</P>
<P>
   5. Brush fresh cod all over with 2 tablespoons olive oil, place
on a baking sheet, and sprinkle with salt. Roast cod until it turns
opaque, about 7 to 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   6. Meanwhile, bring skim milk and remaining 2 teaspoons olive
oil to a simmer in a small saucepan. Add the remaining potatoes and
remove from heat. Using an immersion blender, whip the mixture,
adding frozen butter cubes gradually. Continue to whip until
mixture is very foamy, about 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   7. To serve, dab a small amount of brandade on each of 4 serving
plates. Top each dab with a toasted bread round, then spoon
remaining brandade over. Place cod fillets on top, and cover with
foam. Serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

   MILLBURN, N.J. _ Like many of their neighbors across the
suburbs, the people of Millburn have had it with Bambi.
</P>
<P>
   They are sick of deer eating their garbage, tomato plants and
azaleas. They associate deer more with Lyme disease and highway
collisions than with the wonders of nature. Last year, town workers
picked up 100 battered carcasses from local roads, double the
number of a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've become a major safety hazard,'' said Judith Kramer, a
lawyer who lives in the town's Short Hills section. ``I've seen a
school of them cross my street. What about the children? What about
my dog, Breezy? What if he tries to go after them and gets hurt?''
</P>
<P>
   But unlike other places where hunters or hired sharpshooters
cull the herds, Millburn is taking a costly, though far less
volatile approach to the problem. If all goes according to plan,
dozens of deer will be traveling by trailer on the New Jersey
Turnpike later this month, heading to a temporary home on an
upstate New York farm.
</P>
<P>
   What happens to them after that is unclear. The man
orchestrating their removal, Mark MacNamara, a deer handling
specialist, said some may end up in zoos and some as breeders for
venison farms. Others could go to the slaughterhouse.
</P>
<P>
   New York state law prevents any from being released into the
wild.
</P>
<P>
   Millburn officials admit that exporting deer out of state may
sound extravagant, but the alternative is far less palatable. ``We
don't want to have troubles,'' said Timothy Gordon, the town
administrator, referring to the strife that has engulfed other
places that proposed lethal means for controlling deer.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the region's wealthiest communities, Millburn can
afford to spend $20,000 to battle overpopulation without inciting
civil war. Bob Lund, who directs the state's Community Based Deer
Management Program, said there were 40 or so New Jersey towns
tearing each other apart over hunting. ``Deer overpopulation has
become a social problem, not a biological one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, as the herds grow, the weak and old starve and
the less nimble meet their deaths on the grilles of sport utility
vehicles. Last year, he said, about 20,000 deer were killed by cars
in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Millburn is the first municipality to try moving out its
unwanted deer, and Lund confessed a twinge of doubt over whether it
would succeed, mostly because of basic arithmetic. Whitetail deer,
one of the few species to produce twins and triplets, can replenish
their numbers by 40 percent a year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in interviews with nearly two dozen Millburn residents,
most agreed that while far cheaper, hunting was out of the
question. ``I'd rather just deal with the problem than have them
shot,'' said Jennifer Benenson, 40, who recounted the day she had
to stop jogging and halt traffic so a herd of deer could cross busy
Wyoming Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   There were, however, a few dissenters. Lena Einhorn, 41, a
native of Sweden, called the trapping plan absurd, especially since
some of the deer would invariably end up on the menus of
restaurants. ``I guess it's the American way,'' she said. ``Maybe
I'm not so softhearted, but where I come from, deer meat is a
delicacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Plavin, 39, a personal trainer, said she thought the deer
should just be left alone. ``We're the ones destroying their
habitat,'' she said. ``I happen to think they're beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   MacNamara is racing the biological time clock of the does, which
begin to give birth in May. To get a sense of how many have to be
removed, town officials hired a Colorado-based company to survey
the deer population with an infrared camera mounted on a
helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Lewis, the general manager of Hot/Shot Infrared Inspections,
said the counting was not finished, but a census last year by Essex
County recorded 349 deer in the South Mountain Reservation, 2,000
acres of parkland that borders much of Millburn.
</P>
<P>
   Using figures established by state wildlife officials, Millburn
might have to remove two-thirds of the deer to reach a healthy-size
herd. To maintain that number, the process will have to be repeated
every year.
</P>
<P>
   The town has set up portable pens in parks, where deer will be
lured by apples and molasses. Once caught, they will be shipped
off.
</P>
<P>
   And while Millburn is the first municipality in the state to
adopt the deer export program, Essex County, which includes
Millburn, had decided to try the same approach.
</P>
<P>
   The county is planning a deer control campaign that includes
hiring MacNamara and his padded trailer. About $248,000 of the
$260,000 expenditure will pay for construction of a 23-acre deer
paddock in South Mountain Reservation, where deer will be corralled
into smaller enclosures and eventually shipped out of town.
</P>
<P>
   The fenced-in area, it turns out, replaces one that the county
dismantled two decades ago after animal rights advocates fought to
have its occupants set free. Officials say that many of today's
unwanted deer are descended from those freed from the paddock in
1980.
</P>
<P>
   Having just returned from the job of removing a rotting carcass
from someone's yard, Millburn's animal control officer, Danny
Pariso, could barely contain his glee over the prospect of fewer
deer in town.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to collecting the deer killed by cars, Pariso has to
deal with three or four angry calls a day from town residents who
demand that he remove live deer from their backyards. ``I'm tired
of the dead deer,'' he said, ``and I'm tired of the nasty phone
calls.''

THE THREE STOOGES AS ALUMNI OF THE SCHOOL OF HARD KNOCKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Who doesn't know those numskulls Moe, Larry and
Curly? The Three Stooges _ whose pies in the face, punches in the
gut, headlocks, insults and pratfalls have been embedded in popular
culture since the 1930s _ are back.
</P>
<P>
   But this time the Stooges are poignant, even sad. ``The ideas
that comedians have broken hearts, that's in some ways the story''
of the comedy team, said James Frawley, the director of ``The Three
Stooges,'' a two-hour drama to be broadcast Monday night by ABC.
</P>
<P>
   What stamps the movie, which includes re-creations of original
Stooges comedy routines, is the occasional bleakness of its
portrait of the rise of some working-class boys who took their
cheerful violence onto the vaudeville stage in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   Their fame and success in Hollywood was extraordinary. They made
nearly 200 shorts for Columbia Pictures in the 1930s, '40s and
early '50s but were so exploited by Harry Cohn, the titan who ran
the studio, as well as their longtime agent, Harry Romm, that they
earned relatively little money for themselves and were left
unemployed in 1958. At one point after that, Moe Howard, the
group's leader, was working as a messenger at the studio, even
though Columbia had earned a fortune off the Three Stooges. (In
their years at the studio they never made more than $20,000 each a
year.)
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, they weren't high art icons,'' said Evan Handler, the
actor who plays Larry Fine in the film. ``But you go up to anyone
anywhere and tell them you're playing one of the Three Stooges, and
they begin to laugh. They had that kind of impact. It's actually a
bittersweet story.''
</P>
<P>
   If the story of the Stooges is hardly as tragic as that of
Marilyn Monroe or Judy Garland, who have been depicted in recent
books as victims of Hollywood as well as their own personal demons,
the new drama is a bleak account of a group of men whose zany
public personae were strikingly different from their troubled
private lives. The account has a somewhat happy ending: in the
early 1960s television rediscovered the Stooges' old movies and a
new group of fans emerged.
</P>
<P>
   With the film, the Stooges seem to have come full circle. Not
only is Stooges merchandising earning steady income for the comics'
heirs, but the act has influenced comedians as varied as Jim
Carrey, Adam Sandler, Steve Martin and Chevy Chase, directors like
Robert Zemeckis and Quentin Tarantino and actors like Mel Gibson,
an ardent fan who has credited some of the humor in his ``Lethal
Weapon'' films to the Stooges. ( Gibson's company, Icon
Productions, produced the Stooges film along with, among others,
Craig Zadan and Neil Meron).
</P>
<P>
   The Stooges film is based on Michael Fleming's book, ``From
Amalgamated Morons to American Icons: The Three Stooges''
(Doubleday, 1999). It was adapted by Janet Roach and Kirk Ellis and
stars Paul Ben-Victor as Moe and Handler as Larry, the two
constants in the Stooge lineup; Michael Chiklis plays Moe's brother
Curly and Jon Kassir is Shemp, their other brother, who preceded
Curly in the act and replaced him after Curly's death. In later
years two other comedians, Joe Besser and then Joe DeRita, became
Stooges. But Moe, Curly and Larry are most fans' favorites.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts the Stooges were troubled men. Curly had an
alcohol problem and fell in love with the wrong women; a series of
strokes cut short his career. Larry was addicted to gambling and
was broke most of his life. Moe, the group leader and the most
stable, was despondent that Columbia had brushed him aside.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Lyne, executive vice president of movies and mini-series
at ABC, said the project began when the producers visited her about
a year ago and said that they had a three-word pitch: the Three
Stooges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so startling,'' Lyne said. ``Frankly, I didn't love the
Three Stooges like other people. I was never a fan as a kid. All I
knew about them were they were guys bopping each other on the head
and flopping their arms. But the story was so moving and
surprising. They were guys who fell in love with the idea of show
biz in the early days of vaudeville and went to Hollywood and never
got their due. And only late in life did they realize the impact
they had. I thought this story was great drama.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleming, an author and a columnist for Variety, as well as Joan
Howard Maurer, Moe's daughter, said that the financial insecurity
of the Stooges, who grew up in poverty, had been exploited by Cohn,
who ran Columbia, as well as by Romm, the group's talent agent.
Romm had what Fleming called ``a cozy relationship'' with Cohn. The
two men were close friends.
</P>
<P>
   The Stooges ``were always looking for their next jobs,'' Fleming
said. ``When they began making two-reelers, they were grateful. Moe
was the businessman. But he was so nervous about making waves that
he never tested the waters.''
</P>
<P>
   Maurer, who lives in Los Angeles, said: ``My Dad was fearful. He
didn't want to rock the boat. He didn't have the confidence to sit
down with Harry Cohn and say, `We need more money.''' The Stooges
had been signed by Columbia in 1934. By 1958 the studio, giving up
on comedy two-reelers and seeing no future with the trio, declined
to renew their contact.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Benjamin, Curly's stepson and general counsel of C3
Entertainment, which handles Stooges merchandising, said there were
now about 100 Stooges licensees for apparel, toys and candy, which
provides a steady income for their heirs. He declined to say how
much money was involved, but he said that the yearly income from
merchandising ranked with that of such figures as James Dean and
Elvis Presley.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're as good as any classic property in the world, if not
better,'' he said. ``Their property is worth more now than it was
in their lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the way the Stooges were treated, Benjamin said: ``You have
to keep in mind the context of the times. They didn't have
sophisticated lawyers or agents.'' He added: ``They never forgot
the memory of the Depression. It was that generation _ their
attitude was, `I'm lucky to be working.' The sad part was that they
never knew how popular they really were.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtually the entire cast of characters in the saga of the Three
Stooges is dead. Moe Howard, whose original name was Moe Horwitz,
died of lung cancer in 1975 at the age of 78. Larry Fine, born
Larry Feinberg, also died in 1975, after a stroke. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   Curly Howard, originally Jerome Horwitz, died at 48 in 1952
after a series of strokes.
</P>
<P>
   The act appeared in feature films in the 1960s including ``It's
a Mad Mad Mad Mad World,'' in which the had a cameo as firemen. But
they are known almost entirely from their two-reel shorts, which
have been replayed on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Harry Cohn died, my father went to the studio one day
and the guard wouldn't even let him in,'' said Maurer, recalling
Moe's humiliation. ``That was a low point. He didn't want to see
his acting career end. And then the first segment of their old
comedy was released on television. And my father realized the fans
were still there, a new generation. That was the most important
thing to him. The fans were still there.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Now that ``No Smoking'' and ``No Cell Phones'' icons
have become standard signage at New York restaurants, it may be
time for one more admonishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``No Lingering.''
</P>
<P>
   Daryl Loecher and five of her friends had descended from the
Upper East Side to the East Village for dinner on a recent Saturday
night at one of her favorite restaurants, Il Bagatto, a tiny
bargain on Second Street, between Avenues A and B. The group
arrived five minutes early for an 8:45 P.M. reservation, well aware
of Il Bagatto's policy that diners who arrive more than 10 minutes
late risk losing their table. At 9:05, they were seated. A little
before 11, they were asked to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hostess told us they needed our table,'' Loecher said. ``I
was shocked when she said we'd been given our allotted two hours
for dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   The busboy tried to clear the water and wine glasses, not all of
which were empty, she said. ``Then another hostess walked over and
said, `OK, guys, I gotta ask you to leave. You had your two hours,
now get out.' '' The restaurant serves until 12:45 on Friday and
Saturday. ``I can understand two hours for two people, but six?''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Loecher is not alone. The ups and downs of the stock market
aside, there is still plenty of hungry money out there: demanding
diners and restaurants eager to turn as many tables as possible in
a night. The occasional bum's rush from a white-tablecloth
establishment is not a new phenomenon. But an informal survey
suggests that skirmishes on the contentious border between service
and civility are on the rise. The go-go '00s are no decade for
lingering, especially over dinner. Fortunes are made and lost in
the time it takes to sip a second cappuccino.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Goldman, a director at Newmark &AMP; Co. Real Estate, was
handed his hat in February at Zocalo, an upscale Mexican restaurant
on 82nd Street between Lexington and Third Avenues. The reservation
was at 7, for four. Two of them showed up on time and were seated.
The others, including Goldman, came at 7:35, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within a minute, the appetizer plates were removed and the
entrees were thrown in front of me,'' Goldman recalled. ``A minute
after dishes were removed for the entrees, we were immediately
asked if we wanted dessert. We said we were going to pass on
dessert, but would like a cup of coffee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The waiter walked away and when he came back said, `I was
instructed to give this to you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It was the bill. Goldman protested, demanding to speak to the
manager. The owner came over and told him she had a 9 p.m. party
waiting for the table. Voices were raised.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant has its own version of those events, needless to
say, but more on that in a minute. Nancy Ross was hastened to an
even speedier exit at Angelo &AMP; Maxie's, the steakhouse on Park
Avenue South. Ross, who works in the garment center, clocked her
8:30 Saturday night dinner at a record 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been quick before, but this was ridiculous,'' she said.
``I don't think we were in the chair yet and the menus were
there.'' Within milliseconds the waiter was back over, she
recalled. ``It was nerve-racking. I predicted the time between
coffee and the check would be 50 seconds. It came in at 40.''
</P>
<P>
   In the annals of untimely ejections, though, it is is hard to
beat the tale of Dr. Richard Stock, an oncologist at Mount Sinai.
It happened two years ago, at the old Daniel, but still makes him
angry thinking about it. Stock and 12 colleagues had a 7:30
reservation and were on time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like wines and we were ordering $500 to $600 bottles,'' he
recalled. ``We all had the tasting menu.'' This was probably about
a $6,000 dinner, maybe more, Stock figured, throughout which the
waiter kept informing the group that another party had booked the
table after them. ``I remember them really pressuring us to
leave,'' he said. ``We said we want to order after-dinner drinks _
spending more _ and they just said you can't stay, you've got to
leave.'' It was 9:30.
</P>
<P>
   ``So all of us crammed into the little bar area drinking
Armagnac,'' he said. ``I was so teed off to be treated that way,
especially when we were paying that kind of money.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It is one thing when a restaurant tells you when you make the
reservation that it will need the table by such-and-such a time, as
reservationists often do at Nobu and other coveted restaurants
around town. That is fair warning. What riles people is being
ambushed with the news midmeal. That and any whiff of attitude, as
in ``Don't let the door hit you on the way out.''
</P>
<P>
   Fine dining in New York has always been a more businesslike
transaction than in, say, France. One of the reasons cheese courses
are still a rarity in this city of sophisticated and exacting
palates is that they take too long. As Cello's chef, Laurent
Tourondel, explained, ``It's 30 more minutes at the table.'' He
does it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Smart restaurateurs also avoid accepting 7:30 reservations.
Zarela Martinez, the chef-owner of Zarela, on Second Avenue between
50th and 51st Streets, said, ``The 7:30 table is the one thing that
ruins you. They will stay there till 10 at least. You can't afford
to lose a table like that.''
</P>
<P>
   When the esteemed French chef Alain Ducasse opens his first
American outpost in the Essex House early this summer, he will
adhere to the three-star Michelin requirement of a single seating.
Arrive when you want and own the table for the night. (Paying
dearly for the privilege, one suspects.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is a luxury and a restaurant is a place of luxury,'' said
Ducasse, on the phone from Paris, emphasizing the importance of
``hospitalite'' and `convivialite'' as if they were constitutional
rights inseparable from a three- or four-hour meal. ``We should not
impose time limits,'' he said. Otherwise the restaurant will not be
a place where New Yorkers can find sanctuary from their mortal
enemy: ``le stress.''
</P>
<P>
   New York restaurateurs without Ducasse's deep pockets say that
they can't afford lingerers and that most diners understand this.
Julio Pena, co-owner of Il Bagatto, said he thinks that two hours
is ``plenty of time'' for a party of six to finish dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't realize that the restaurant has been around five
years and the prices don't change,'' he said. ``The way we make our
money is by turning tables over.'' He says if patrons run over that
time and he needs the table back, he offers to buy them a drink in
the downstairs lounge. But, he said, ``sometimes when you start the
conversation, they just assume you're kicking them out. They get
angry. `How dare you? I spent money here!' I had an argument one
night with people who had finished their dinner and were completely
drunk. I said I'll buy you a drink if you give us the table. They
wanted to start a fight. That's the insanity of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wearily, Pena said, ``This business is getting rougher and
rougher.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Shapiro, the owner of Zocalo, said she remembers the
confrontation with Goldman. She said that the restaurant made an
exception in seating an incomplete party and that he was ``aware
the table was rebooked at 9.'' The reason she, and many
restaurateurs, don't seat incomplete parties is that the latecomers
think their allotted two hours for dinner starts when they get
there, and the table is ``lost'' for the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was getting ugly,'' Shapiro said of the dispute with
Goldman. ``The guy was just really really really making it
difficult for everybody involved. I asked him never to come back to
the restaurant again.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Goldman said, ``I've waited at Balthazar, I've
waited at Fressen.'' He's even been asked to get up before, he
said. ``But I've never been asked like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Angelo &AMP; Maxie's did not return calls to explain its
table-turning policy. But Georgette Farkas, a spokeswoman for
Daniel, in both its incarnations, said she was shocked that anyone
would have been asked to leave her restaurant. ``We always allow
three hours for every table,'' she said. ``It sounds like somebody
working in the dining room made a big mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hourglass Tavern, the old Restaurant Row standby in the
Theater District, solved the problem when it opened two decades
ago. There's an hourglass at each table. When the last grain of
sand runs out, so does your eating time. But even with those strict
house rules, the Hourglass is more flexible than some of its
competitors. As Christopher Sideris, the owner, said, ``Yeah, sure,
sometimes we let people go an hour and a half.''

WHAT'S ROUND AND SWEDISH AND NOT A MEATBALL?
</HEADLINE>
 By RICHARD W. LANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The sweet almond- and cream-filled buns called
fettisdagsbullar are uniquely Scandinavian treats that were
traditionally served every Tuesday from Shrove Tuesday in February
until Easter.
</P>
<P>
   Their closest Anglo-Saxon equivalent is the much more modest hot
cross bun, which the English, with their usual reserve, manage to
put off eating until Good Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The distinctive essence of fettisdagsbullar, literally Fat
Tuesday buns, derives from cardamom, almond paste, sugar and
whipped cream.
</P>
<P>
   With a bow to our waistlines, my family and I no longer consume
a large dinner and then feast on these delicious buns for dessert.
We simply make a meal of them.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner was never so indulgent.
</P>
<P>
   To make fettisdagsbullar, you cut an upside-down pyramid out of
the top of the baked bun, remove this lid and fill the cavity with
a generous helping of almond paste, followed by a large dollop of
whipped cream. The lid is then perched on top of the whipped cream,
and the whole affair is dusted with powdered sugar.
</P>
<P>
   The buns are great served simply that way, but if you want to
eat them in the truly Swedish manner, place each bun in a deep soup
bowl, pour scalded milk all around it and eat the fettisdagsbullar
with a spoon.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you nibble around the edges to keep the bun from
becoming too soggy or cut right to the almond paste so you get some
with every bite is a matter of personal style. In our family, we're
about equally divided.
</P>
<P>

into a round bun. Place buns on baking sheet, cover with plastic
wrap, and let rise until doubled, about 2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   5. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Beat remaining egg, and brush
buns with it; bake until brown, 10 to 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   6. Shred almond paste and mix with a little light cream until it
has the consistency of cream cheese. Cut a triangular shape out of
the top of each bun, then fill bun with almond paste and a dollop
of whipped cream. Place cut-out bun on top, and dust with
confectioners' sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 12 buns.

   New Amistad Prepared For Maiden Voyage &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Amistad, a full-size reproduction of the 129-foot slave
ship, was launched recently in Mystic, Conn., and will make a
series of calls along the East Coast on its maiden voyage in July.
Conceived as an educational device, the Amistad will call New Haven
its home port. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1839, 53 Africans seized control of the Amistad, and tried to
force the Spaniards who had purchased them in Havana to sail them
to their homeland. Instead, they were captured and imprisoned in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   After several trials, they were freed by the Supreme Court in
1841, with the help of former President John Quincy Adams. The 35
survivors returned to Africa. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The new Amistad was built at Mystic Seaport using many of the
tools and methods of the 19th century. On June 1, it will begin sea
trials before embarking on its maiden voyage to New York. The
138-ton schooner is to join the OpSail 2000 parade of tall ships in
New York Harbor on July 4.
</P>
<P>
   From New York, the Amistad will join other tall ships in New
London on July 11, then head to New Haven on July 15. Events in New
Haven will include a $50-a-ticket reception at the Maritime Center
at Long Wharf on July 14, as well as an interfaith service on the
town green, free concerts and arts and crafts events on July 15. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wherever the Amistad is berthed, docents will be on hand to
answer questions, as will a dockside exhibit describing life for
the captives aboard. The public will be welcome to board the vessel
_ free the first year.
</P>
<P>
   The Amistad is owned and operated by Amistad America, a
nonprofit educational foundation.
</P>
<P>
   For the Amistad's schedule, call (860) 536-6003 and for details
about the New Haven events, (203) 499-2680; other information is at
www.amistadamerica.org and www.mysticseaport.org. &QL;

   In Israel, Classic Opera In an Ancient Theater &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From May 25 to June 21, Israel's first International Opera
Festival will take place in the Roman Theater in Caesarea on the
Mediterranean Sea, as part of the annual Israel Festival, which is
primarily held in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The opera festival opens with the first of seven performances of
Puccini's ``Turandot,'' directed by Hugo de Ana of Argentina.
``Elektra'' by Richard Strauss receives its first staging in Israel
on June 14 under the direction of Rina Yerushalmi of Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   Two more performances of ``Elektra'' are scheduled on June 17
and 18. On June 21, the soprano Jessye Norman concludes the
festival with a program titled ``Verdi to Duke Ellington,''
conducted by Asher Fisch.
</P>
<P>
   The Israel Symphony Orchestra will play for all performances,
and the New Israeli Opera Chorus will take part in both opera
productions. Scheduled as soloists are Audrey Stottler as Turandot
and Nicola Martinucci and Vitali Taraschenko alternating as Calaf
in ``Turandot.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jane Johnson and Marilyn Zchau will alternate as Elektra,
with Reinhild Runkel as Klytamnestra, Claudio Otelli as Orest and
Tina Kiberg as Chrysothemis. Tickets are $37 to $80 (at 4.05
shekels to the dollar) from the box office, (972-3) 692-7777.
</P>
<P>
   A new acoustical system for the 2,000-year-old amphitheater is
scheduled to be finished for the festival. Excavations of the
ancient city of Caesarea are continuing near the theater, which is
about a 40-minute drive north of Tel Aviv and about an hour and a
half from Jerusalem.

   Four Seasons Opening Its First Hotel in Egypt &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts is opening its first property in
the Middle East this month, with the date set tentatively for
Wednesday, on the west bank of the Nile in Cairo. The hotel is part
of the First Residence, a complex of luxury apartments and villas,
a shopping mall and a casino just south of al-Gamaa Bridge in Giza,
adjacent to the zoo and botanical gardens.
</P>
<P>
   The Four Seasons says the hotel's 230 rooms measure 474 to 614
square feet; there are also 43 suites, four of which have two
bedrooms. All rooms have large marble bathrooms with deep soaking
tubs and separate showers, and many have views of the Pyramids in
Giza, about 10 miles southwest of the hotel. The business center
will offer translation and secretarial services.
</P>
<P>
   Dining choices include Seasons, an all-day restaurant with a
display kitchen serving Mediterranean cuisine, with African and
Italian touches; the clublike Library Bar, which has a cigar bar; a
tea lounge; a coffee bar, and a poolside grill. There will be
24-hour room service. Adjacent to the outdoor pool is a spa with a
beauty salon, exercise room, massages and skin-care treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The Four Seasons Hotel Cairo at the First Residence is at 36
Nile Street, Giza, Cairo, Egypt 12311; (20-2) 573-1212, fax (20-2)
568-1616. Double rooms normally cost $250 to $330 and suites $490
to $3,400 a night, but till July 31, there is an introductory rate
of $145 a room and a 25 percent discount on suites. Reservations:
(800) 332-3442. &QL;

   Denver Airport Easing Hunt for Computer Jack &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all airports have pay telephones with credit card readers
or jacks for a laptop computer, but travelers can have trouble
finding an open one. Denver International Airport decided recently
to ease that problem by putting those features on every phone. In a
few weeks, technicians will begin pulling out all of the airport's
800 pay phones and replacing them with 1,000 that will have a card
reader and a data port.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Cannon, an airport spokesman, said that about 10 percent
of the current phones have credit card readers or data ports.
Demand from customers with laptops is especially high, he said,
adding, ``Everybody has an e-mail address.'' The phase-in will take
about a year, he said. &QL; 
 &QL;

   `Adults' Get Younger At Disneyland
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Peter Pan wanted to remain a kid: growing up can be
expensive sooner than one thinks. At Disneyland earlier this month,
10-year-olds became adults _ at least at the ticket window.
</P>
<P>
   The theme park in Anaheim, Calif., now applies its $41 adult
price to visitors 10 and older, down from age 12. Children 3 to 9
still get in for $31.
</P>
<P>
   The reasoning behind the decision is that kids seem to grow up
fast nowadays _ physically, anyway. ``We believe our attractions
are enjoyed by people 10 years and above, based on height
requirements,'' Ray Gomez, a park spokesman, said. ``So the change
was appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   The parks at Walt Disney World in Lake Buena Vista, Fla., had
already switched to this pricing scale. &QL;

has completed an unbeaten season in SEC play, including a victory
over previously unbeaten Florida, and enters the conference
tournament this weekend as the favorite. The man behind the team's
success is coach Jeff Wallace, who has led the team to the nation's

for leading the team to the nation's elite. (Towers, Atlanta

<P>
   With Passover beginning Wednesday, there's no better time to
check in with Kosherfinder, a site that celebrates all things
Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   The opening page includes links to a special Passover report,
and also features sections on health and nutrition, wine, kosher
dishes, books, colleges and dispatches from Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the ``on campus'' features notes that this summer,
20 Dartmouth students will be participating in ``Israel 2000,'' a
program that allows Jewish college students who have never been to
Israel to visit the Jewish Holy Land for free.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the news section led off with a British court ruling
against historian David Irving, who challenged the scope of the
Holocaust. Irving had sued an American scholar for libel, claiming
she had labeled him a ``Holocaust denier.'' In ruling against
Irving, a British judge labeled him ``anti-Semitic and racist.''
</P>
<P>
   The Passover section is especially interesting, even for the
uninitiated. It explains the origin of the Jewish holiday, the
significance of the Seder plate and how to prepare for Passover,
among other things.
</P>
<P>
   The recipe section (known alternately as ``Kosher Classics'' and
``Bubbie's Kitchen''), offers Passover specialties, such as
cauliflower kugel with mushrooms.

<P>
   In the problems-we-wish-we-had department, there's a big piece
on ``sudden-wealth syndrome'' {ndash} essentially people who strike
it rich investing in Internet stocks or somesuch and immediately
plunge into depression. Apparently, psychiatrists solve the problem
by charging outrageous fees and siphoning off some of that
new-found wealth. Favorite line in the piece, ``Once you're done
sneering{hellip}'' Oh, I don't think we'll ever be done. There is
also a fairly useful story on tech investing, which tries to steer
you toward the stock that isn't about to crash into a bridge
abutment and burst into a ball of flame. Bottom line: You might
have better luck picking winners at Phoenix Greyhound Park. There
is also an interesting short written by someone who made a cell
phone their only phone, and soon learned what ``searching for
service'' really means.

   It's only like a page long, but Chris Harris' takeoff on the
Census (an ersatz letter written by Census director Kenneth
Prewitt) is one long belly laugh. A few samples: ``We have been
accused of undercounting certain segments of the population. This
is simply not true, and we think all three of our nation's Native
Americans will back us up on this.'' Or, ``Moreover, although there
are no problems with the Census, we are constantly making
improvements to correct those problems.'' There is an interesting
piece on the Russian mob in America, noting FBI warnings that the
so-called ``Mafiya'' could soon become the No.1 criminal
organization in the U.S. Finally, an explanation for the popularity
of Yakov Smirnoff. A well-done piece on obsessive-compulsive
disorder questions whether it's such a great idea to drown the
``doubting disease'' in an ocean of Prozac.

<P>
   TRUE WEST
</P>
<P>
   This fun little mag , published in Cave Creek, devotes itself to
debunking some of the myths of the Old West perpetuated by
Hollywood. For example, John Wayne didn't really die in
(beginitalic)The Cowboys(enditalic). So you can stop being so mad
at Bruce Dern. Seriously, this month's issue notes that not all
cowboys carried Colt Peacemakers. Some, including notorious outlaws
Frank and Jesse James, were more partial to Remington revolvers.
Also, Wild Bill Hickok and Calamity Jane were not lovers, despite
what the supermarket tabloids said. There is also an interesting
piece on Western ``stock actors,'' who traveled from town to town
performing in different plays, making the grandiose sum of $8 per
week. The most famous stock performer may be John Wilkes Booth,
Lincoln's assassin.
</P>
<P>
   VANITY FAIR
</P>
<P>
   There is the usual Hollywood feature, this time on flaky cover
girl Kim Basinger, the Janie one-note actress who is always being
compared to someone who was a lot better. In this case, it's
Marilyn Monroe. Puh-lease. We get to hear about her angst over
being famous, beautiful and married to hunk movie star Alec
Baldwin. It's a heavy load to bear. Searching for more fluff? The
magazine doesn't disappoint, posing Sarah Ferguson in a blazer and
fishnet stockings for a Q&AMP;A. On the serious side, there is a book
excerpt on the real-life maritime disaster that inspired Melville
to write (beginitalic)Moby-Dick(enditalic): the 1820 sinking of the
Nantucket whaler, (beginitalic)Essex, (enditalic)by a rogue sperm
whale. Historian Nathaniel Philbrick draws on newly discovered
documents to weave the tale of the crew, who were driven to near
madness after being set adrift in the Pacific.

BALLET TECH: THE BEAT GOES ON FOR A HARBINGER OF SPRING
</HEADLINE>
 By JACK ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Ballet Tech Co. presented two works for small
casts to repetitive recorded scores on Friday night at the Joyce
Theater. Both pieces, choreographed by Eliot Feld, appeared to
reflect a belief that as long as a musical beat goes on, dancers
should keep dancing. And Feld was inventive enough to make
relentless movement look interesting. Indeed, he created two types
of relentlessness.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Tuthill was perpetually lyrical in ``Kore,'' a solo to
a chiming score by Steve Reich. In Greek, Kore is another name for
Persephone, the mythological maiden doomed to spend part of the
year in the underworld. But when she returns to earth, she brings
spring.
</P>
<P>
   As an eternal harbinger of spring, Tuthill kept circling the
stage, swaying and curving. She sometimes whirled, but never
fiercely; she sometimes sped forward, but never with anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   She also found time to recline on the floor in statuesque
positions. And when she rose, she was light and bouncy. Tuthill
remained unruffled throughout the demanding solo.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas ``Kore'' showed a preservation of serenity, ``Yo
Shakespeare,'' a male duet, required its dancers to look always
energetic. Nickemil Concepcion and Jason Jordan performed it with
unflagging vitality to a score by Michael Gordon filled with sharp,
driving sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Feld had his men race and leap, often in unison, and grapple as
if wrestling. Although the duet resembled an athletic event, it did
not appear to depict cutthroat competition. Rather, both men seemed
caught up by musical and choreographic rhythms. What this dance had
to do with Shakespeare was unclear. But its choreography crackled.
</P>
<P>
   The program also included repeat performances of ``Consort'' and
``Paper Tiger.''

<P>
   Nearly 2 inches of rain fell in Los Angeles late Monday and on
Tuesday as a powerful Pacific storm swept ashore. Wednesday, this
low pressure area will take aim at the eastern Rockies and Plains,
bringing the risk of severe thunderstorms, heavy rain and snow.
</P>
<P>
   An area of showers will affect parts of the Middle West on
Wednesday morning as humid air from the Gulf of Mexico ascends over
a nearby warm front. Strong thunderstorms will then erupt Wednesday
afternoon near the Missouri River Valley. Winds shifting direction
with increasing altitude will cause a few of the storms to rotate.
These rotating storms, called ``supercells,'' are capable of
spawning tornados.
</P>
<P>
   A cold rain will drench parts of the northern Plains. As the air
further cools on climbing the sloping terrain, heavy snow will fall
in the Black Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Damp weather will linger near the New England coast, while drier
conditions return to the interior Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: CALIFORNIA RAIN
</P>
<P>
   More rain fell in parts of Northern California on Monday than
typically falls during all of April. Sacramento more than doubled
its previous daily rainfall record when 1.48 inches fell. Some
areas near the Sierra had more than 5 inches of rain Sunday and
Monday. Heavy rain will become an increasingly scarce commodity in
California as the jet stream winds that energize storms weaken and
retreat northward. Indeed, the average rainfall in Sacramento for
the months of May through September is less than an inch. &QL;

   EARNINGS-CCE _ ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Enterprises, the Coke
system's largest bottler, cut its net loss nearly in half in the
first quarter, meeting Wall Street estimates. Tuesday, the company
reported a net loss of $35 million, or 8 cents a share, compared
with a loss of $62 million, or 15 cents a share in the year-ago
period. (Seward, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   EARNINGS-COKE _ ATLANTA _ For the second consecutive quarter,
Coca-Cola reported a loss of 2 cents a share after taking one-time
charges totaling 24 cents a share, or $680 million. The company
said Tuesday it lost $58 million in the first quarter after
spending $275 million, or 8 cents a share, on its massive
reorganization that will eliiminate 5,200 jobs worldwide. It also
spent $405 million, or $16 cents a share, to write down its excess
bottling capacity in India. Without those non-recurring items, the
company would have earned 22 cents a share on an ongoing basis,
beating the consensus estimate of analysts by a penny. (Unger,

that investors are looking for high-quality stocks whether
technology or blue chips. The many frivolous dot-com stocks that

probably fall by the wayside, some analysts say. (Walker, Atlanta

   EARNINGS-CCE _ ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Enterprises, the Coke
system's largest bottler, cut its net loss nearly in half in the
first quarter, meeting Wall Street estimates. Tuesday, the company
reported a net loss of $35 million, or 8 cents a share, compared
with a loss of $62 million, or 15 cents a share in the year-ago
period. (Seward, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   EARNINGS-COKE _ ATLANTA _ For the second consecutive quarter,
Coca-Cola reported a loss of 2 cents a share after taking one-time
charges totaling 24 cents a share, or $680 million. The company
said Tuesday it lost $58 million in the first quarter after
spending $275 million, or 8 cents a share, on its massive
reorganization that will eliiminate 5,200 jobs worldwide. It also
spent $405 million, or $16 cents a share, to write down its excess
bottling capacity in India. Without those non-recurring items, the
company would have earned 22 cents a share on an ongoing basis,
beating the consensus estimate of analysts by a penny. (Unger,

   DOW-MAIN _ ATLANTA _ The stock market correction may or may not

that investors are looking for high-quality stocks whether
technology or blue chips. The many frivolous dot-com stocks that

probably fall by the wayside, some analysts say. (Walker, Atlanta

   DOW-EXEC _ ATLANTA _ Everybody it seems has jumped on the stock
options bandwagon, real estate firms, law firms and now executive

<TEXT>
<P>
   Fanny Kemble wrote a memoir about life in slave-era Georgia
that, when published in her native England, was credited with
convincing Parliament to withdraw loans to the Confederacy, which
in turn weakened the war effort in the clash between the North and
South. On the other hand, in ``Enslavement: The True Story of Fanny
Kemble,'' she spouts such balderdash as ``No one can paint me as I
am because I am not what I appear to be'' and ``I am sick to death
of being Fanny Kemble but I'm so good at it, I can't do anything
else'' _ in the film's first six minutes. So you're not really
inclined to think very well of her, regardless of the historical
record.
</P>
<P>
   And one suspects that Jane Seymour, who stars as Kemble and
serves as executive producer of ``Enslavement,'' really didn't have
anything powerful or persuasive or interesting to say about
slavery, she just wanted to be heroic while parading around in some
really elegant gowns. And so she does, after winning the heart of a
wealthy landowner named Pierce Butler (Keith Carradine), who tells
her, ``I would never attempt to restrict you;'' but of course,
after the requisite love scene, he's doing precisely that not five
minutes later in the film. The rest of the movie is just as subtle.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Sally Hemings: An American Scandal,'' which aired on CBS
two months back, ``Enslavement'' can't decide whether it's a story
about race or just a standard-issue bodice-ripper; unlike
``Hemings,'' it's more at home as the latter. Director James Keach,
Seymour's husband, gives himself the role of a simpering yet heroic
doctor who chases Fanny; he also opens the movie with an
exploitative and otherwise unrelated scene straight out of
``Mandingo'' of semi-nude slaves brutalized for engaging in a
romantic coupling.
</P>
<P>
   He also bathes his wife in so much soft focus the whole movie
feels fuzzy. Though the film spans 20 years and Fanny was in her
50s during the Civil War, Seymour _ whose British accent sounds
like the result of watching an hour or two of ``Masterpiece
Theatre'' _ doesn't seem to age a day. Sitting through this,
however, will most definitely impress upon you the ravages of time.

SHE TOOK THE BULLET, BUT NOW SHE CALLS THE SHOTS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sofia Coppola mumbles. She slouches. She twists and twirls her
hair a lot. She can be painfully shy. She isn't much of a
storyteller and will take the visual over the verbal any day of the
week.
</P>
<P>
   These things become immediately apparent when you spend time
with the 28-year-old daughter of high-powered director Francis Ford
Coppola, a young woman who up until now has been most famous for
being a bad actress.
</P>
<P>
   But Sofia Coppola never wanted to be an actress in the first
place. When her father cast her as Michael Corleone's daughter in
``The Godfather, Part III,'' she gamely went along with the idea,
mostly because she was bored with school at the time. She never had
any illusions, though, about her talent in front of a camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't even supposed to be in the movie,'' Coppola says
softly. ``I was in Rome on Christmas vacation, and they called and
asked me to come to the set. Winona Ryder had dropped out of the
production, and I had already read the part during a round table
reading. My father asked, and I said yes. I just kind of jumped
into it. I never thought about the hugeness of the movie or all the
hoopla surrounding it. When I was there, I was just trying to stay
afloat.''
</P>
<P>
   She hated almost every minute of it. ``The Godfather III'' was a
preordained disappointment (how do you follow the first two
chapters?), and Sofia received much of the blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``The criticism was really intended for me,'' Francis Ford
Coppola says. ``Just like the end of the story, when the little
girl gets the bullet that was meant for her father.''
</P>
<P>
   The little girl is now a grown woman, and after successful
career stints as a photographer and fashion designer, she believes
she has found the job she knew she wanted all along. Coppola has
directed her first film, ``The Virgin Suicides,'' a movie she
adapted herself from Jeffrey Eugenides' novel about five lustrous
sisters who commit suicide and the young boys who can't shake their
memory.
</P>
<P>
   Coppola believes directing was something she always knew she
could do. But, ``When something's really close to you, you don't
see it,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean she wasn't aware of the career possibilities.
There are those famous genes, of course, not that her father
encouraged her one way or the other. (``He wants you to follow your
own path,'' she says.) Coppola made quite a few home videos when
she was young, and took great pleasure in ``getting the other kids
to do what I wanted them to do.'' In fact, what soured her on
acting (besides all the bad reviews) was the inability to boss
people around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not interested in having someone dictate my choices to
me,'' she says. ``I like to be the one doing the dictating.''
</P>
<P>
   She might be the most placid dictator in history. Contrasting
with her famously animated father, Coppola prefers to be seen, not
heard. When directing a scene, she stands right by the camera, in
order, she says, to make the actors feel more relaxed. But it's
probably out of necessity, too; otherwise no one would ever hear
what the soft-spoken Coppola had to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never worked with a director that quiet,'' says actress
Kirsten Dunst, who plays Lux Lisbon, the oldest ``Suicides''
sister. ``Sofia never raised her voice once. She was always so
calm, so collected and so open to other people's ideas. But
underneath that calmness, she was in total control. She always had
an answer and a reason for whatever was happening in the scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Such assurance came from Coppola's total familiarity with the
material. Coppola read ``The Virgin Suicides'' four years ago and
immediately connected with the story, for reasons she's not able
(or willing) to articulate. After learning that someone had already
purchased the film rights to the book, Coppola decided to write a
screenplay anyway, figuring it would be a good exercise if nothing
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt really protective about the book, and I had all these
ideas about how it should be done,'' Coppola says. ``So I'd write
on the weekends, and before I knew it, I was halfway through, and I
thought, 'Well, I should finish it.' When it was done, I had
pictured every shot.''
</P>
<P>
   She had pictured it so well that when producer Julie Costanzo
passed her screenplay along to the company that owned the book,
they ditched their plans and offered Coppola the directing job.
Costanzo says it was the writing, not the family name, that got
Coppola hired, although Francis Ford Coppola did come on board as
one of the film's producers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Dunst, ``The Virgin Suicides'' stars James Woods
and Kathleen Turner, who played Coppola's mother in Francis Ford
Coppola's 1986 film ``Peggy Sue Got Married.'' Woods, playing
against type as a milquetoast father, ultimately became Coppola's
most outspoken and protective supporter, proclaiming, ``I hope this
movie is a success so that all the naysayers who slammed her when
she was a teen-ager because her father cast her in a movie will
finally get to shut up.''
</P>
<P>
   Coppola smiles when told of Woods' comments, but if she's bitter
about anything in her past, she does a good job of hiding it. She
married director Spike Jonze (``Being John Malkovich'') last summer
at her parents' estate in the Napa Valley. (Was it close to that
big wedding scene in ``The Godfather''? Coppola: ``Kind of,
yeah.'')
</P>
<P>
   She talks now of being a ``supportive wife'' for Jonze and
wanting to learn to be a ``homemaker.'' The couple lives in Los
Feliz.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'd really like to learn to do is cook,'' Coppola says.
</P>
<P>
   Might her father have some input in that area?
</P>
<P>
   ``He says he's going to teach me how,'' she says. ``And that's a
pretty good thing because he's almost as good a cook as he is a
director.''!end! &QL;

   ``The Miracle Maker'' brings us the Life of Christ in the same
medium that transformed Gumby into a children's icon, Claymation,
mixed intermittently (and irritably) with inferior other styles
(probably farmed out to other animators in order to meet some
deadline or budgetary constraint).
</P>
<P>
   The cast of voices _ led by Ralph Fiennes as Jesus, and
including Julie Christie (playing Mary Magdelene, who's not a
prostitute here, just a little crazy), William Hurt (who, even
though his mug's nowhere in sight, !ital!still!off manages to
overact), Ian Holm, Richard E. Grant and so on _ underscores the
intended level of reverence surrounding this project. And at times,
the tableaux created are visually impressive. Particularly the
crucifixion, but then, every filmmaker tends to do a good job with
the crucifixion; if you can't make that stirring, you don't belong
in the business.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the story is delivered with a reverence
bordering on bloodlessness; kids may enjoy the animation, but
there's nothing that fresh here that parents haven't sat through
countless times before. One imagines the brainstorming session:
``How !ital!hasn't the story of Jesus been told?'' Stay tuned for
next year's sock-puppet version; it really couldn't be any

EMERGENCY ANNOUNCEMENTS ON TV MUST BE CLOSED CAPTIONED, FCC SAYS
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Communication Commission has adopted a
rule requiring television broadcasters to accompany any
announcements about emergencies with text messages displayed on the
screen, the better to alert deaf viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The rule is part of a broad plan to make telecommunications and
technology more accessible to Americans with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new rule will be a lifesaver for millions of people in
this country,'' said William E. Kennard, the commission's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 54 million Americans with disabilities, about 27 million
suffer from hearing impairments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is long overdue,'' Kennard said. ``This should have been
done years ago. It is that important to public safety.''
</P>
<P>
   The new rule, which was unanimously approved by the commission,
requires broadcasters to deliver information ``intended to further
the protection of life, health, safety and property'' to viewers
with hearing impairments. Information in such reports would include
details regarding the areas affected by emergencies, evacuation
orders and routes and approved shelters, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard said that the rule would apply to a range of emergencies
including tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, snowstorms and
earthquakes. It would also involve warnings and watches, he said,
for impending changes in weather and community disasters like toxic
spills, widespread power failures and industrial explosions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the FCC ordered broadcasters, cable operators and
satellite distributors to provide closed-captioning technology on
new television programs, with all new programming to feature the
service by 2006. Also under the rule, 75 percent of programs from
before 1998 must offer closed captioning by 2008.
</P>
<P>
   Closed-captioning technology provides information on the screen
in text form, like subtitles, that allow deaf people and those with
hearing loss to watch TV. Unlike subtitles, closed captioning is
encoded data transmitted in the television signal, and provides
details about sound effects and background noise.
</P>
<P>
   A viewer seeking closed captioning must have a decoder. All
televisions made since the early 1990s are capable of carrying
closed captions.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the National Association of Broadcasters did not
return phone calls this week seeking comment.

SHE TOOK THE BULLET, BUT NOW SHE CALLS THE SHOTS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sofia Coppola mumbles. She slouches. She twists and twirls her
hair a lot. She can be painfully shy. She isn't much of a
storyteller and will take the visual over the verbal any day of the
week.
</P>
<P>
   These things become immediately apparent when you spend time
with the 28-year-old daughter of high-powered director Francis Ford
Coppola, a young woman who up until now has been most famous for
being a bad actress.
</P>
<P>
   But Sofia Coppola never wanted to be an actress in the first
place. When her father cast her as Michael Corleone's daughter in
``The Godfather, Part III,'' she gamely went along with the idea,
mostly because she was bored with school at the time. She never had
any illusions, though, about her talent in front of a camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't even supposed to be in the movie,'' Coppola says
softly. ``I was in Rome on Christmas vacation, and they called and
asked me to come to the set. Winona Ryder had dropped out of the
production, and I had already read the part during a round table
reading. My father asked, and I said yes. I just kind of jumped
into it. I never thought about the hugeness of the movie or all the
hoopla surrounding it. When I was there, I was just trying to stay
afloat.''
</P>
<P>
   She hated almost every minute of it. ``The Godfather III'' was a
preordained disappointment (how do you follow the first two
chapters?), and Sofia received much of the blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``The criticism was really intended for me,'' Francis Ford
Coppola says. ``Just like the end of the story, when the little
girl gets the bullet that was meant for her father.''
</P>
<P>
   The little girl is now a grown woman, and after successful
career stints as a photographer and fashion designer, she believes
she has found the job she knew she wanted all along. Coppola has
directed her first film, ``The Virgin Suicides,'' a movie she
adapted herself from Jeffrey Eugenides' novel about five lustrous
sisters who commit suicide and the young boys who can't shake their
memory.
</P>
<P>
   Coppola believes directing was something she always knew she
could do. But, ``When something's really close to you, you don't
see it,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean she wasn't aware of the career possibilities.
There are those famous genes, of course, not that her father
encouraged her one way or the other. (``He wants you to follow your
own path,'' she says.) Coppola made quite a few home videos when
she was young, and took great pleasure in ``getting the other kids
to do what I wanted them to do.'' In fact, what soured her on
acting (besides all the bad reviews) was the inability to boss
people around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not interested in having someone dictate my choices to
me,'' she says. ``I like to be the one doing the dictating.''
</P>
<P>
   She might be the most placid dictator in history. Contrasting
with her famously animated father, Coppola prefers to be seen, not
heard. When directing a scene, she stands right by the camera, in
order, she says, to make the actors feel more relaxed. But it's
probably out of necessity, too; otherwise no one would ever hear
what the soft-spoken Coppola had to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never worked with a director that quiet,'' says actress
Kirsten Dunst, who plays Lux Lisbon, the oldest ``Suicides''
sister. ``Sofia never raised her voice once. She was always so
calm, so collected and so open to other people's ideas. But
underneath that calmness, she was in total control. She always had
an answer and a reason for whatever was happening in the scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Such assurance came from Coppola's total familiarity with the
material. Coppola read ``The Virgin Suicides'' four years ago and
immediately connected with the story, for reasons she's not able
(or willing) to articulate. After learning that someone had already
purchased the film rights to the book, Coppola decided to write a
screenplay anyway, figuring it would be a good exercise if nothing
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt really protective about the book, and I had all these
ideas about how it should be done,'' Coppola says. ``So I'd write
on the weekends, and before I knew it, I was halfway through, and I
thought, 'Well, I should finish it.' When it was done, I had
pictured every shot.''
</P>
<P>
   She had pictured it so well that when producer Julie Costanzo
passed her screenplay along to the company that owned the book,
they ditched their plans and offered Coppola the directing job.
Costanzo says it was the writing, not the family name, that got
Coppola hired, although Francis Ford Coppola did come on board as
one of the film's producers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Dunst, ``The Virgin Suicides'' stars James Woods
and Kathleen Turner, who played Coppola's mother in Francis Ford
Coppola's 1986 film ``Peggy Sue Got Married.'' Woods, playing
against type as a milquetoast father, ultimately became Coppola's
most outspoken and protective supporter, proclaiming, ``I hope this
movie is a success so that all the naysayers who slammed her when
she was a teen-ager because her father cast her in a movie will
finally get to shut up.''
</P>
<P>
   Coppola smiles when told of Woods' comments, but if she's bitter
about anything in her past, she does a good job of hiding it. She
married director Spike Jonze (``Being John Malkovich'') last summer
at her parents' estate in the Napa Valley. (Was it close to that
big wedding scene in ``The Godfather''? Coppola: ``Kind of,
yeah.'')
</P>
<P>
   She talks now of being a ``supportive wife'' for Jonze and
wanting to learn to be a ``homemaker.'' The couple lives in Los
Feliz.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'd really like to learn to do is cook,'' Coppola says.
</P>
<P>
   Might her father have some input in that area?
</P>
<P>
   ``He says he's going to teach me how,'' she says. ``And that's a
pretty good thing because he's almost as good a cook as he is a
director.''!end! &QL;

THIS LIFE OF JESUS HAS FEET OF CLAY

Our rating: 2{ stars

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Miracle Maker'' brings us the Life of Christ in the same
medium that transformed Gumby into a children's icon, Claymation,
mixed intermittently (and irritably) with inferior other styles
(probably farmed out to other animators in order to meet some
deadline or budgetary constraint).
</P>
<P>
   The cast of voices _ led by Ralph Fiennes as Jesus, and
including Julie Christie (playing Mary Magdelene, who's not a
prostitute here, just a little crazy), William Hurt (who, even
though his mug's nowhere in sight, !ital!still!off manages to
overact), Ian Holm, Richard E. Grant and so on _ underscores the
intended level of reverence surrounding this project. And at times,
the tableaux created are visually impressive. Particularly the
crucifixion, but then, every filmmaker tends to do a good job with
the crucifixion; if you can't make that stirring, you don't belong
in the business.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the story is delivered with a reverence
bordering on bloodlessness; kids may enjoy the animation, but
there's nothing that fresh here that parents haven't sat through
countless times before. One imagines the brainstorming session:
``How !ital!hasn't the story of Jesus been told?'' Stay tuned for
next year's sock-puppet version; it really couldn't be any
kitschier than this.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Fanny Kemble wrote a memoir about life in slave-era Georgia
that, when published in her native England, was credited with
convincing Parliament to withdraw loans to the Confederacy, which
in turn weakened the war effort in the clash between the North and
South. On the other hand, in ``Enslavement: The True Story of Fanny
Kemble,'' she spouts such balderdash as ``No one can paint me as I
am because I am not what I appear to be'' and ``I am sick to death
of being Fanny Kemble but I'm so good at it, I can't do anything
else'' _ in the film's first six minutes. So you're not really
inclined to think very well of her, regardless of the historical
record.
</P>
<P>
   And one suspects that Jane Seymour, who stars as Kemble and
serves as executive producer of ``Enslavement,'' really didn't have
anything powerful or persuasive or interesting to say about
slavery, she just wanted to be heroic while parading around in some
really elegant gowns. And so she does, after winning the heart of a
wealthy landowner named Pierce Butler (Keith Carradine), who tells
her, ``I would never attempt to restrict you;'' but of course,
after the requisite love scene, he's doing precisely that not five
minutes later in the film. The rest of the movie is just as subtle.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Sally Hemings: An American Scandal,'' which aired on CBS
two months back, ``Enslavement'' can't decide whether it's a story
about race or just a standard-issue bodice-ripper; unlike
``Hemings,'' it's more at home as the latter. Director James Keach,
Seymour's husband, gives himself the role of a simpering yet heroic
doctor who chases Fanny; he also opens the movie with an
exploitative and otherwise unrelated scene straight out of
``Mandingo'' of semi-nude slaves brutalized for engaging in a
romantic coupling.
</P>
<P>
   He also bathes his wife in so much soft focus the whole movie
feels fuzzy. Though the film spans 20 years and Fanny was in her
50s during the Civil War, Seymour _ whose British accent sounds
like the result of watching an hour or two of ``Masterpiece
Theatre'' _ doesn't seem to age a day. Sitting through this,
however, will most definitely impress upon you the ravages of time.
</P>
<P>
   _____ &QL; 
The show: ``Enslavement: The True Story of Fanny Kemble'' &QL; 
What: Biopic about an abolitionist who wore really elegant gowns. &QL; 
The stars: Jane Seymour, Keith Carradine, Adewale

ANIMALS BY AIR: IT'S BEASTLY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 23) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BETSY WADE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Air travel is not the best way to go for pets, experts agree.
The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals leads
on this view. Barbara Listenik of Brooklyn, who shares her life
with Boris, a mixed boxer-pit bull that all but died on a trip in a
cargo hold, is not far behind.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly losing Boris late in 1996, Listenik undertook a
crusade to improve animal safety in the air that met a measure of
success when President Clinton signed what she calls ``the Boris
Bill.'' It is a tiny blip in the act reauthorizing the Federal
Aviation Administration, which Clinton signed April 5. But ``my
crusade is not over,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The Boris Bill, which was introduced last summer by Sen. Frank
R. Lautenberg, D-N.J., and Rep. Robert Menendez, also a New Jersey
Democrat, requires for the first time that airlines report the
numbers of animals they carry, and how many die or are lost or
injured. The Department of Transportation, which gathers other air
travel data, will devise a reporting formula, then collect and
publish statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, all figures on how many animals go by air have been
estimates. The Air Transport Association estimates that 750,000
animals _ 500,000 of them pets, the rest laboratory animals or
commercial shipments _ travel annually.
</P>
<P>
   With real figures, the bill's advocates hope, will come improved
handling and a better way for travelers to select a line on the
basis of performance. The law also requires better training for
airline employees.
</P>
<P>
   Just the same, Listenik does not plan further air travel with
Boris, she said recently as she was preparing for two television
appearances. Boris the spokesdog will travel by auto just fine, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Listenik's bad adventure with Boris began with her arrival at La
Guardia Airport on Christmas Eve 1996. After a Delta flight from
Fort Lauderdale, Fla., she went to baggage claim and found the
dog's container crushed and empty, except for a few teeth. The dog
was outdoors being chased by cargo crew. He dashed inside, the
police in pursuit, out again and disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Listenik, a mural artist, put up posters offering a reward. Six
weeks later, she found him in an abandoned building in Corona,
Queens. He was in poor shape, but she brought him back to health,
which involved dental surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Enlisting animal-advocacy groups, including the ASPCA, and pet
owners who had similar experiences, she began a campaign. A major
goal was to require forced-air ventilation in the cargo holds of
all types of planes, not just in wide-body jets as at present.
</P>
<P>
   This part of the original bill was vigorously opposed by the Air
Transport Association, representing the airlines. The airlines said
they would stop carrying animals altogether if they were compelled
to retrofit cargo areas. This brought the American Kennel Club and
the American Zoo and Aquarium Association in on the side of the
airlines lest there be a cutoff of air transport. The provision was
dropped from the bill in conference.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it is commercial shipments of animals, not travel of
individual pets, that are the source of the major horror stories.
Dr. W. Ron DeHaven, a veterinarian who heads the animal care
division of the United States Department of Agriculture, says that
care of animals has improved since the early '90s, when major fines
began to be levied against airlines.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Delta paid $140,000 after 32 dogs out of 106 being
shipped to pet stores suffocated when the cargo hold was not opened
during a delay. United paid $48,000 in a settlement in the early
'90s when 24 animals died. TWA paid $60,000 in March 1994 for
failing to ensure sufficient air and veterinary care.
</P>
<P>
   ``This turned things around,'' DeHaven said of the fines. ``The
lines recognized their liability and the negative public reaction.
They instituted much better training.'' An important change since
the days of the multiple animal suffocations, he added, is that
airline captains are now told when they have animal shipments
aboard and can better deal with delays on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   One legal change may prompt closer attention from airline
employees. In January, the government raised to $2,500, from
$1,250, the amount an airline must pay a traveler for irretrievably
lost luggage. The loss of a pet falls under this rule, so while the
compensation may not make a dent in a pet owner's grief, it may
make baggage handlers more cautious.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Airlines limit pets in the cabin because of concern about
passengers who may be allergic to them. But under certain
circumstances, most permit a small cat or dog, or even a hamster or
guinea pig, to travel under the seat in front of the passenger in
the cabin.
</P>
<P>
   Most airlines restrict how many pets may travel this way, so it
is important for the passenger to tell the airline and to keep
checking close to flight time. The animal must ride in an approved
pet carrier with an absorbent liner.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines charge for pet passengers. The cost for an animal
traveling as cargo is based on weight (including the carrier), the
attached bag of food and the rest. The fee for the in-cabin animal
is set by each airline; the range is $50 to $75 each.
</P>
<P>
   General airline rules, including requirements for veterinary
certificates, are posted on the ATA Web site,
www.air-transport.org; click on Pet Travel Guidelines. Diana Cronan
of the association says that this part of the organization's Web
site gets the most hits, an average of 700 a month. The ASPCA also
has advice on pet travel at its site, www.aspca.org (type
``travel'' in the search box).
</P>
<P>
   Individual airlines should be checked. American Airlines, for
example, according to John Hotard, a spokesman, will not carry
animals in the cargo hold between May 15 and Sept. 15 because of
heat. Delta may not take animals if the outdoor temperature at
either end of the flight exceeds 85.
</P>
<P>
   No airline guarantees that a pet going as cargo will travel on
the same flight as its owner. This means the owner must stay in
touch about pickup. All of this shows why experts are cautious when
discussing animals in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would not recommend it unless there is no other way,'' said
Nancy Blaney, who heads the ASPCA's national legislative office.
</P>
<P>
   Air travel by guide dogs has long been covered by the Air
Carrier Access Act, but a Hawaii state requirement for four-month
quarantine effectively prevented blind people who travel with dogs
from visiting Hawaii. After a 1993 suit under the Americans With
Disabilities Act, backed by the Justice Department, a settlement
was reached in 1998 permitting precertified vaccinated guide dogs
immediate entry.
</P>
<P>
   Kim and Brian Charlson of Watertown, Mass., who are both blind
and use guide dogs, made a trip to Hawaii in 1999, after
participating in the suit against Hawaii. They were there in 1980,
before they used dogs, and had wanted to return because Charlson
has relatives there and because they enjoyed it. Charlson said they
plan to go again in November, with their German shepherds, Jubilee
and Keegan.

   MIDEAST-JOURNAL _ BETHLEHEM, West Bank _ Palestinian Jihad
Mubarak was destined to be a fighter in the war against the
Israelis. Instead, he sells them antiques. His uncle, a doctor in
the Jordanian army, delivered him on May 1, 1948, two weeks before
the Arab states attacked the new state of Israel. Name him Jihad,
the uncle ordered. It's Arabic for a Muslim sacred cause or, in
this case, a Holy War. Jihad is an unusual name for a Christian,
but with war coming, it seemed appropriate. But Mubarak, turning 52
this week, has focused his life on beautiful antiques, cars and, he
admits, women. When the 1967 war began and the 19-year-old Mubarak
might have fought, the same uncle that delivered him gave a medical
excuse out of the war. Jolly and easy going, the gray-haired
Mubarak sells antiques to Israelis, and has never fought them. His
nondescript store, on the outskirts of Bethlehem, is one of the
most peaceful spots I've found here, a place where Israelis, Arabs
and foreign visitors browse over collectibles from Europe, Syria
and made in Bethlehem. (Kaplow, Cox News Service). 30. WITH PHOTO.

CMGI BUYING $20 MILLION STAKE IN TVISIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CMGI Inc. is pumping $20 million in cash into TVisions Inc., a
company that builds large-scale commercial Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI's venture capital unit, CMGI (at)Ventures, will obtain a
stake of undisclosed size in TVisions. Ralph Folz, chief executive
of TVisions, said the Cambridge, Mass. company will use the extra
cash to open more offices outside the Boston area, beginning with
New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The company will also seek to hire more workers and boost its
marketing and advertising expenditures, in an effort to build up
nationwide name recognition. Folz also said that the deal will
enable TVisions to sell its services to some of the approximately
50 Internet companies in which CMGI (at)Ventures holds a stake.
</P>
<P>
   TVisions now employs 150 people. The company has designed Web
sites for a number of large local customers, including Fidelity
Investments, Staples Inc., and Analog Devices Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys have demonstrated the ability to double annually
from a revenue perspective and to be very profitable along the
way,'' said David Nerrow, general partner with CMGI (at)Ventures,
who will become a member of the TVisions board.
</P>
<P>
   Nerrow declined to give precise figures on TVisions' revenue and
profits, but added: ``We look at this investment as one that's not
nearly as speculative as some other investments CMGI (at)Ventures
might make.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of CMGI, of Andover, Mass., closed up 87.5 cents at
$65.875 Tuesday, on the Nasdaq stock exchange.

CHILLING FIRST-PERSON TALES FROM CAMBODIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Publication notes for two books appear at end of
review.)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the three years that the Khmer Rouge tried to create an
agrarian utopia in Cambodia, 2 million people are believed to have
died from execution, starvation and disease. Two million _ a
horrifying number, but so large as to seem almost an abstraction,
like the distance to the nearest star. The number gains far greater
psychological force with these two new memoirs, whose authors, both
young girls in the Cambodia of the time, describe the terror and
losses they suffered during the Khmer Rouge revolution in
wrenchingly particular terms.
</P>
<P>
   Chanrithy Him was 9 and living with her family in Phnom Penh
when the Khmer Rouge forced the entire population of the city to
evacuate their homes and trek into the countryside. Luong Ung was 5
and living with her parents and eight brothers and sisters when
that occurred. Him's book, ``When Broken Glass Floats'' (the title
refers to a Cambodian proverb), takes her and her large family to a
village called Daakpo in northeastern Cambodia and then, after the
Vietnamese invasion of 1978 drove the Khmer Rouge from power, to a
Thai refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
   Ung's book, ``First They Killed My Father,'' describes a similar
trajectory, beginning in Phnom Penh and winding to a place called
Ro Leap in far western Cambodia; in 1978, the surviving members of
the Ung family escaped to Vietnam, and then by boat to Thailand.
Both Him and Luong, who now live in the United States, tell their
stories straightforwardly, vividly, and without any strenuous
effort to explicate their importance, allowing the stories
themselves to create their own impact. Neither of these writers
speculates on why the French-educated Khmer Rouge leaders, who
seized power after a long guerrilla war, forged a regime in which
cruelty and murder became revolutionary values. But they do tell,
graphically enough so that it is sometimes difficult to keep on
reading, what it meant to be in the way of those values in the
years that they prevailed in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm adjusting to my new environment, a world where formality
and politeness are not a necessity _ indeed are banned,'' Him
writes of a stretch of several months when, at age 10, she worked
in a labor camp. ``Instead, cruelty is the law by which the people
are ruled, a law designed to break our spirits. In the name of
padewat (the revolution).''
</P>
<P>
   Both Him and Ung have written what might be seen as
representative stories from the Cambodia of 1975 to 1978. They came
from educated middle-class families, the kind of people who were
anathema to the Khmer Rouge, who saw education as an obstacle to
acceptance of the radical equality they espoused.
</P>
<P>
   Him's father was a government bureaucrat; Ung's, a military
policeman. Both were killed by the Khmer Rouge, and so, later, were
their wives. Both authors also lost siblings and friends from
starvation, overwork, exhaustion and disease. As children, Him and
Luong knew hunger, forced labor camps, separation, the smell of
corpses rotting in fields and the hatred of the tyrants who imposed
this suffering on them in the name of a higher good. Him worked
clearing land and planting rice in a children's work camp. Luong,
at the age of 8, received military training in a military training
camp for children.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are the children of the Angkar,'' the 40 children in the
camp were told. The Angkar, meaning organization, was the name
given to the Khmer Rouge leadership. ``You are here because you are
the brightest and fastest. You are fearless and are not afraid to
fight. The Angkar needs you to be our future.''
</P>
<P>
   Both women begin their books with brief accounts of life in
Cambodia just before the American defeat in neighboring South
Vietnam enabled the Khmer Rouge to overthrow the pro-American Lon
Nol regime and to seize power. Ung describes herself as a
5-year-old tomboy frequently scolded by her mother for her lack of
manners, quarreling with her brothers and sisters and protected by
her revered father. In April 1975, Khmer Rouge soldiers appeared in
Pnom Penh and told people to leave the city immediately, shooting
those who refused on their doorsteps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are they doing this, Pa?'' one of Ung's brothers asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because they are destroyers of things,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   Ung's father, saying he was an ordinary worker, survived for two
years, until one day two soldiers came to the rural work camp where
the Ung family was living and told him they needed his help with an
ox wagon broken down outside the village. Ung's father knew it was
the end.
</P>
<P>
   `` `My beautiful girl,' he says to me as his lips quiver into a
small smile. `I have to go away with these two men for a while,'''
Ung writes of that crushing moment.
</P>
<P>
   For Him, the losses came more quickly. Two weeks after the
family arrived in her grandfather's village, her father and her two
uncles were taken away in oxcarts for what was called orientation
but what was really execution. She remembers the men of her family
sitting around a table for breakfast the morning of their
departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though together, they seem alone, like strangers who have
never met,'' she writes. ``Their stillness sends a strange air
through the house, a sadness so heavy that it radiates like thick
smoke, choking me. Suddenly I feel lonely.''
</P>
<P>
   Other losses followed, most painfully the unnatural deaths of
their mothers. Him was told that her sick mother had been thrown
down a well while still alive; Ung's mother and younger sister were
shot in a field by Khmer Rouge soldiers. The authors tread lightly
where their own emotions are concerned, concentrating instead on
describing the grim task of survival, especially the task of
finding food in a starving country. Him describes the taste of
roasted mice. Ung tells how her mother was beaten when she tried to
buy a black market chicken to give to a sick child. Once, she
remembers, a poor man in the village killed and ate a stray dog. He
was executed by the Khmer Rouge for his failure to share the dog
meat with the rest of the community.
</P>
<P>
   Him and Ung describe the general joy that greeted the Vietnamese
soldiers who invaded Cambodia in 1978 and dislodged the Khmer Rouge
from power. Eventually each made her own way to refugee camps in
Thailand and to the United States. Him has worked in a clinic that
studies traumatic stress disorders among Cambodian survivors; Ung
is national spokeswoman for the human rights group Campaign for a
Land Mine-Free World.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of these books provides an overall history of the horror
inflicted by the Khmer Rouge, part of a wider horror brought on by
that peculiar 20th-century urge to remake human societies in a new
image. The historians will one day write of the overall nature of
that effort, the way it linked societies otherwise as different as
Ethiopia under Mengistu Haile Mariam, North Korea under Kim Il Sung
and Cambodia under the secretive chieftain Pol Pot. For now, these
books by two intelligent and morally aware young women tell us what
it was like to struggle to survive while others played out utopian
dreams above them.

 &HT;    Let lushness of leaves supply garden color that outlasts flowers
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, April 20.
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If your nails are black and blue _ black from hard work, blue
from bloom-inducing fertilizers _ it may be time to turn elsewhere
for garden color.
</P>
<P>
   Most plants need a certain amount of sunlight to flower, and if
your yard's mostly shade, you know that's an uphill battle. But
even if you're blessed with sun, many spring- and summer-blooming
perennials perform for only two or three weeks. (Annuals bloom for
months, if you don't mind replacing them every season.)
</P>
<P>
   To compensate, why not emphasize plants that offer colorful
leaves throughout the season?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so important to consider the foliage of plants because,
if you're lucky, your plants will bloom for a few weeks _ not a
whole growing season. You need to think about the leaves,'' said
Mildred Pinnell, horticulturist at the Atlanta Botanical Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Garden centers are brimming with options right now, but as you
shop, remember: Foliage with vibrant color or even just interesting
texture can take the form of trees, shrubs, perennials or annuals _
some that bloom, some that don't.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge is combining those plants so that the foliage is
complementary. If color wheels and paint charts leave you dizzy,
think of choosing plants as you would a wardrobe: A purple scarf
looks great against a chartreuse dress, a red jacket can really set
off a yellow shirt.
</P>
<P>
   For summer, one of the quickest means for giving your garden
bold leaf color is tropicals, such as purplish-black elephant's
ears and red-, yellow- and purple-striped cannas.
</P>
<P>
   Among annuals, coleus has become a hot seller in recent years
since growers came out of their greenhouses with varieties that
thrive in sun. And speaking of the tried-and-true, when it comes to
bulbs, you can't beat caladiums, with their variegated red, pink,
white and green foliage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mixing some of these wonderful foliage plants _ with or
without great perennials _ gives you interest all season long,''
said Brad Balsis, manager of Habersham Gardens, an Atlanta
retailer.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Rushing about a cavernous warehouse here, David
Adickes, a sculptor, scrambles up and down ladders putting the
finishing touches on Ulysses S. Grant's necktie and Franklin D.
Roosevelt's ears. He doesn't seem the least worried that six of his
18-foot presidential busts _ he has done one for each president _
sit forlornly atop flatbed trailers on the outskirts of
Williamsburg, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The polished concrete busts have been barred from a proposed
educational theme park there because Adickes and investors in the
project lack the appropriate permits from the local zoning
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bump, not a barricade,'' said the plaster-speckled
sculptor, who has run into opposition before. A 76-foot statue of
Sam Houston that Adickes created for the city of Huntsville on the
bicentenary of the statesman's birth in 1993 drew a storm of
protest, too, but is now firmly in place.
</P>
<P>
   Now as then, the issue is size. ``Big heads scattered throughout
the woods is not exactly going to have a modest impact on the
landscape,'' said Edwin J. Pease, an architect and adjunct
professor of art at the College of William and Mary at
Williamsburg.
</P>
<P>
   But big is the point, Adickes argues. ``You've got to have that
`wow factor' or no one is going to come see it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the huge, walking-stick-wielding Sam Houston has become
a popular attraction in Huntsville, which had previously been
associated mainly with executions at a nearby state prison.
Adickes, 73, has created oversize sculptures for other sites in
Texas, among them a cello, a banana, a trumpet and a telephone
stationed in front of various office buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The heads of the presidents arrived in Williamsburg on March 17,
the same day that York County officials secured an injunction
prohibiting Everett H. Newman III, Adickes' partner in the
so-called Presidents Park project, from unloading them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We appear to have had a miscommunication,'' said Newman,
president of FCR Group, a commercial real estate development
company in Williamsburg that is also responsible for the nearby
Water Country U.S.A. amusement park.
</P>
<P>
   Newman said he understood from informal discussions with county
representatives that he could accept delivery of some of the heads
from Texas to show zoning officials as well as potential investors
what they looked like. Informed otherwise, Newman is applying for
permits and searching for an interim place to store the six busts:
Woodrow Wilson, John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, Herbert Hoover,
Martin Van Buren and Thomas Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going through the appropriate channels and hope to have
the park open by October,'' said Newman, who estimates that the
park, on an 11-acre site at the intersection of Interstate 64 and
Route 99, will cost $15.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   The response to a mail-in ``Heads or tails?'' survey distributed
by The Virginia Gazette, whose readership primarily consists of
Williamsburg's old guard, was overwhelmingly against the Presidents
Park. But the sculptor is undeterred. ``People were in an uproar
about the Eiffel Tower and Statue of Liberty at first, but they
came around,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Adickes said the idea for Presidents Park came to him four years
ago while he was visiting Mount Rushmore. ``It was so grand and
impressive, but because it was so far away, it lacked a sense of
intimacy,'' he said. Better, he thought, to have busts of all the
presidents, not just four, in a lush landscape that visitors could
walk right through while consulting plaques inscribed with
biographical information.
</P>
<P>
   Adickes said he had spent $500,000 constructing the 41 busts,
which took him four years to create. He expects to recoup his
investment from the $8 fee that he and Newman plan to charge for
admission to the park.
</P>
<P>
   Creating the busts has been a painstaking process. ``People
would say, `Surely you can use the same ears,' but no, they're all
different,'' he said. ``And the neckties vary as well. LBJ wore a
thin tie, Ford wore a big fat one and Bush and Reagan wore ties
that were somewhere in between.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't even ask about cravats and bow ties.
</P>
<P>
   If he took any artistic liberties, Adickes said, he might have
been a little kinder than nature. ``I didn't put all the wrinkles
around Ronald Reagan's neck,'' he said, ``and Bill Clinton's nose
is probably smaller than it really is.'' But over all, he said, his
presidents are physically and historically accurate.
</P>
<P>
   To create the presidents' heads, Adickes first sculptured
life-size clay busts based on photos, paintings, etchings and
images on American currency. ``Gerry Ford was the hardest to
make,'' Adickes said, because he has ``no features that you can
really latch on to.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimating each bust's horizontal gradations in circumference,
Adickes cut Styrofoam into corresponding rings, 10 times human
size, then layered them to get a rough outline of each president.
``It's the same idea as cutting a bell pepper into rings and then
stacking them back together to get the full form,'' Adickes
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Spreading clay and plaster over the Styrofoam, he perfected each
face and covered it with a combination of sheetrock, mud joint
compound and cement. Then he applied a layer of rubber, followed by
plaster. When the plaster set he had his mold, which he filled with
concrete to create the final bust.
</P>
<P>
   If Newman files the necessary papers on time, the fate of
Presidents Park will probably be decided in May. ``We are going to
give it a fair shake,'' said Walter C. Zaremba, chairman of the
York County Board of Supervisors, which has jurisdiction over the
site.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the crowds visiting the heads still perched on
their trailers 10 minutes from Colonial Williamsburg, the park
might be a tourist draw. ``You'll never meet a city or county that
is not interested in furthering its economic development,'' Zaremba
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Adickes is contemplating his next project. ``I'm
thinking of a Cadillac ballet with the cars in tutus bobbing up and
down on hydraulic lifts,'' he said. Location to be announced.

 &HT;    An Atlanta delegation is in the former Soviet Union to help Jews
hold a Seder and celebrate their fledgling religious freedom
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Say Passover to Alan Kaplan and his response is more immediate
this year than it's ever been.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about connectedness and family,'' said the
35-year-old Atlantan. ``And that family is worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   That point was driven home to him in a ``chilling'' way last
year when he traveled to Minsk, Belarus, in the former Soviet
Union, to teach Jews there how to celebrate the eight-day spring
holiday of Passover that begins at sundown today.
</P>
<P>
   He and three other members of an Atlanta delegation sponsored by
the Jewish Federation of Greater Atlanta were surprised to find
that most people they met in Belarus had forgotten the meaning of
Passover and knew almost nothing about how to celebrate the
traditional holiday feast called a Seder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking at this 78 year-old man, and he's telling me his
last memory of Passover was from his grandfather, when he was 5 or
6,'' Kaplan said. ``A lot of the senior citizens said that.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Atlanta delegation is in Minsk this year to help Jews
conduct a Seder and learn about their faith.
</P>
<P>
   These Atlantans are participating in what has become a
significant effort in recent years to help Russian Jews recover the
practice of their faith. In addition to Atlantans, groups from
Baltimore and Chicago are carrying out a similar mission in other
former Soviet republics this week.
</P>
<P>
   Their zeal to reach out is in response to decades of oppression
that has decimated the practice of Judaism in Russia. Because of
the Holocaust and Soviet discrimination, Jews in much of Eastern
Europe know little, if anything, about Judaism, its traditions and
beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional roles of teacher and student relative to
holidays and specifically Passover have become reversed,'' Kaplan
said. ``The adults are learning from the younger generation about
Passover and religion.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's federation team is in Minsk today and the rest of
the week to conduct Seders. A Seder is a ritual meal in which the
story of the Hebrews' Exodus from Egypt 3,000 years ago is told.
</P>
<P>
   ``By us being able to send people over, it's like a modern-day
exodus,'' said the federation's Michael Grossman, 37. ``This is one
way of freeing them from the oppression they've lived under for so
long without any sort of Judaism. And we are helping them rekindle
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta agency picked Minsk because it is trying to develop
a sister city program, Grossman said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Holocaust, 5.8 million Jews lived in the former
Soviet Union, but now no more than 1.5 million do. Since 1972, more
than 1.9 million have immigrated to Israel, and hundreds of
thousands to the United States. Jews began trying to leave Russia
to escape persecution before the turn of the 20th century, when
pogroms were common and young Jewish men were often conscripted
into the Russian army for 25 years or more.
</P>
<P>
   Just last year, 57,720 former Soviets immigrated to Israel and
6,641 to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Emily Blumenthal, an Atlanta attorney who's in Minsk now, plans
to conduct several Seders with help from Jewish college students
fromMinsk and Kiev.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've prepared a Haggada (the story of the Exodus
traditionally read at Passover), one in Russian and one English, so
we can all be on the same page, literally and figuratively,'' she
said. ``We shipped matzo. There'll be various Judaic gifts, a Seder
plate and a kiddish cup. All these will be surprises to the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Each Seder has 15 steps, including a commandment to sip several
cups of a special kosher wine, and to recline on pillows _
something the Hebrews under Pharaoh's thumb were banned from doing.
During the entire holiday, Jews are supposed to eat only unleavened
foods. According to the Torah, the Jewish name for the first five
books of what Christians call the Old Testament, Israelites fled
Egypt in such a hurry they had no time to bake bread. They took
dough and baked it in the desert sun into hard, flat crackers
called matzo.
</P>
<P>
   But Jews in Minsk don't know about matzo, or much else about the
holiday's traditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think many will have ever been to a Seder,''
Blumenthal said. ``We hope they will hold Seders in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim Ullner, another Atlanta attorney on this trip, said she
expected a side benefit, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a trip like this can give us all a little bit of
perspective and help us realize how lucky we are,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Gastel was part of last year's Atlanta delegation, and her
thoughts echoed Kaplan's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Jews trying to reacquaint Jews with where they came
from,'' she said. ``I'm sad they don't know as much as what my
parents were able to provide me. Jews need to be over there helping
Jews be Jews. Other religions are over there trying to educate
people, too. It's a mitzvah (a good deed).''
</P>
<P>
   Continuing education is critical, Kaplan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized how hungry people were there to identify with their
religion, whether it be Jewish or otherwise, after being prohibited
from religious practice for so long,'' Kaplan said. ``These
missions are worthwhile. But what I got out of it personally was a
greater appreciation and dedication for my own religion.''
</P>
<P>
   What seemed to affect those in Minsk most was the idea that they
were part of a worldwide group in which religious rituals are
similar everywhere and Seders were being performed at the same time
of day around the globe, Kaplan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're saying the same Haggada they're looking at, and the
words are identical, except there were two languages,'' he said.
``They were struck that the same rituals were being done all over
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that there's an analogy between the Exodus and
Passover in the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made it clear that Passover represents the release from
bondage, which represents freedom, being free from slavery,'' he
said. ``For them, it's almost a metaphor _ they have been released
from religious slavery. We made that connection, that just like the
Jews who were released from bondage in Egypt, so too were they
released from religious bondage to be able to find their promised
land, or freedom of religion.''
</P>
<P>
   It's traditional during Seders for Jewish kids to ask several
questions of adults, including, ``What makes this night different
from any other night?''
</P>
<P>
   When that question was asked during Seders he conducted, Kaplan
was moved, realizing that in Minsk and much of the former USSR,
thousands of people have never heard it, let alone know the answer.
</P>
<P>
   That, he said, made him realize even more how important his
religion is to him. And starting tonight, he feels sure the holiday
will take on added meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was affected in a very profound way, Jewishly,'' he said.
``What I got in Minsk was a greater appreciation and dedication for
my own religion, which I've always been free to practice, but took
for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something I'll take for granted again.''

&HT;     PROTEST WITHOUT PASSION
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Imitations are never as powerful as the original,
whether we are talking art works or street protests.
</P>
<P>
   This week's odd, disorganized demonstration in the nation's
capital by a motley collection of grubby radicals was aimed at
scaring key global financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The simplistic theory was that big is bad, forget the details.
</P>
<P>
   But the days when student radicals could set our moral agenda
with extremist rhetoric are long gone. The rest of us _ perhaps
including these young people's parents, the original hippies _ have
grown up.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters couldn't even explain coherently why they were
demonstrating. Although they accomplished none of their central
goals, they vow to demonstrate again at the Democratic National
Convention in Los Angeles in August. Why pick on the Democrats and
not the Republicans, you might wonder. If their real quarrel is
with international corporate greed, you would think the
conservative party with its big-business ties would be the more
appropriate target.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not about making sense. This is about making noise.
The protesters have every right to do that, and we have every right
to conclude they are stupid and self-indulgent.
</P>
<P>
   They tied up traffic in the nation's capital, forced employees
to lose a workday and businesses to lose money. Wow, that's power.
</P>
<P>
   Childish theater of the absurd, however, has limited practical
appeal. We have seen it before. We are jaded.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators did not manage to shut down the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund meetings, the principal target of all
the fuss. They did not generate a swell of sympathy across the
nation for youthful rebellion. Repeatedly taunting the capital's
police as ``oppressors'' did not provoke visible oppression. If the
protesters wanted confrontation, they should have tackled New York
City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's out-of-control cops.
</P>
<P>
   The marchers did not rekindle the passions of the late 1960s,
when young people had a real cause worth fighting for _ ending the
Vietnam War in which their peers were dying. If the current
protesters had a message, it was lost in a fog of muddled and
meaningless complaints about international financial policies that
few of them understood.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that the demonstrators are behind the curve. The
World Bank and the IMF have already been under pressure for years
from more responsible sources to reform their worst elitist
practices. Scholars, foreign policy experts and politicians have
complained about secrecy, lack of environmental concern and
inexplicable loans to corrupt, ungovernable countries. Both
institutions have been trying to improve, although it is difficult
to distinguish between public relations and sincere efforts to
change.
</P>
<P>
   While the bureaucrats pay lip service to the idea of waiving the
debt of poor nations, for instance, not much progress has been
made.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody has to pick up that tab. And rich countries
understandably don't want to bail out Uganda or Sierra Leone or a
host of others without a guarantee that somehow the killing and
tribal warfare in those places can be permanently stopped. As
usual, reality trumps idealism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make a difference and have fun,'' an organizer advised a
gathering of demonstrators. But having ``fun'' by trashing the
rights of other, law-abiding citizens is a distortion of our
constitutional right to protest. It wasn't fun, of course, for the
police and inconvenienced local citizens.
</P>
<P>
   A well-timed, chilly rain also reduced the fun for kids used to
their creature comforts, many of whom went home earlier than
organizers planned. So much for the depth of their convictions.
</P>
<P>
   And thanks to careful police preparation, there was none of the
violence or property vandalism that characterized protests during
the World Trade Organization gathering in Seattle last fall.
However many thugs were among the crowd here, they never had the
opportunity to run wild.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters are claiming victory because they called
attention to their concern about worldwide poverty. But just what
was it the world was watching?
</P>
<P>
   Many of these protesters weren't serious. They weren't even
passionate. They were just there, milling around, looking for
trouble _ bored teenagers trying to mimic the folks of the old
days. Why should we listen to them, even if we could figure out
what they were trying to say?
</P>
<P>
   If this view makes me an old fogey, so be it. Old fogies get to
have opinions and vote too.
</P>
<P>
   At least I am smart enough to blame the leaders of poor
countries for their own problems, not the international
institutions that are striving to help them. And what did dumping a
manure pile in the street, as one group did, have to do with
protesting poverty anyway?

&HT;     TEXAS SHRIMPERS ALARMED BY FISHERY WARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN MacCORMACK  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Texas commercial shrimpers say they are confused
and alarmed by recent warnings from state officials that the
fishery may collapse unless the harvest is reduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just baffled. We haven't supported closing areas in the
past, and we certainly don't support it now,'' Wilma Anderson of
the Texas Shrimp Association, which represents gulf shrimpers, said
from her Port Aransas office Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Moore of San Leon, who represents bay shrimpers, agreed:
``It happens every about five years, and here we are again: The sky
is falling, and the industry is about to collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   Shrimping is always a politically sensitive issue in Texas, and
the latest flap came after Hal Osburn, director of the coastal
fisheries division of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department,
announced the results of an 18-month study.
</P>
<P>
   The agency found a 30 percent decline in adult spawning shrimp
in the Gulf of Mexico since the 1970s, indicating fewer shrimp are
available to replenish the population.
</P>
<P>
   Osburn warned that the shrimp industry faces ruin if current
trends continue, and he said the agency will consider imposing gear
restrictions, as well as bag and size limits to reduce catches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are dealing with 30- to 40-year trends, and we're basically
saying they have to be reversed or we'll get to a very bad point,''
said Osburn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also have around the world a number of examples of shrimp
fisheries that have collapsed: Australia, the Persian Gulf, South
China and Mexico,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A frank exchange of views is expected April 26 when the agency's
Shrimp Advisory Committee meets in Austin, the state capital, to
discuss the proposed rule changes.
</P>
<P>
   Among the invited speakers are representatives of environmental
and recreational groups, which favor reducing shrimping, as well as
commercial shrimpers who say their livelihood is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   The committee will later make a non-binding recommendation to
the Texas Parks &AMP; Wildlife Commission, which makes the rules for
commercial shrimpers.
</P>
<P>
   The shrimp industry has a $500 million impact in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Shrimpers, who have seen their numbers shrink steadily over the
years, say further cutbacks will force more of them out of
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1984, we had over 5,000 boats in this fishery. Now we have
1,200,'' said Moore.
</P>
<P>
   He said shrimp populations rise and fall from year to year,
depending on weather and rainfall, and that there is no statistical
basis for Osburn's claim about a looming crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Moore cited a report in January by a National Marine Fisheries
biologist on populations of commercial species of shrimp harvested
in the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The report by James Nance, chief of fisheries management for the
NMF at Galveston, found that ``none of the four managed species are
currently considered to be overfished or approaching an overfished
condition, nor is overfishing occurring.''
</P>
<P>
   While noting that the catch in Texas has been down slightly
since 1995, Nance concluded that ``environmental conditions were
the dominant factors that influenced the catch in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Contacted Tuesday, Nance said he could not comment on the recent
state study or its conclusions.

VIETNAM TODAY: FORGOTTEN IMAGES REVEAL THE WAR FROM THE COMMUNIST
SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: April 30 marks 25 years since the fall of Saigon. This is the
second of several articles on Vietnam and the war's legacy, there
and in the United States. A special section is available on The New
York Times.Learning.Network: www.nytimes.com/learning/saigon) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOI, Vietnam _ Bundled in two sweaters and a coat in his
chilly, tiny apartment, an old photographer described in sharp
detail his most cherished image of the war _ a young woman, bent
under her burden of supplies, laboring up a steep rock face on the
Ho Chi Minh trail.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody _ not even the photographer, Dinh Dang Dinh _ has ever
seen that picture. After three months on the trail in 1974, all his
film, 80 rolls of it, was destroyed in an attack by a U.S. F-4
Phantom jet.
</P>
<P>
   Streamers of exposed film fluttered from a treetop, said Dinh,
who is now 80. His first impulse was to photograph the destruction,
but that is another image that remains only in his memory. All his
cameras were destroyed in the attack as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't sleep for a month, it was so awful,'' he said.
``Sometimes I still can't sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Many thousands of other photographs do survive from a corps of
photographers who recorded the war on the communist side, both in
North and South Vietnam. But these pictures are as little known
outside Vietnam as the long-gone work of Dinh.
</P>
<P>
   Now, decades later, a selection of those photographs is being
gathered by two U.S. researchers who have dug through government
archives and tracked down a dozen of the aged photographers who
risked their lives to take them.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years after the fighting ended, something surprising
is emerging: a new visual record of the war whose images had once
seemed so familiar.
</P>
<P>
   They are pictures of battle and of daily life from the other
side _ of barefoot guerrillas attacking a tank, of an outdoor
operating theater in a swamp, of children studying in a bomb
shelter, of a young soldier smiling brilliantly at the camera
moments before he was killed in a bombing raid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've printed hundreds of these from the original negatives,''
said one of the researchers, Doug Niven, who is preparing a book
along with his associate, Chris Riley. The work is similar to a
previous project in which they produced a book of portraits of
victims of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys would just bring us plastic bags full of negatives,
and we'd just hold them up to a loop and go through them,'' Niven
said. ``Some of them are as good as the most famous photographers
on the Western side. But they've been in the shadows for 25
years.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent interviews here and in Ho Chi Minh City, the former
Saigon, seven of the photographers talked about their work,
recalling what they said were the most intense and rewarding years
of their lives. They photographed the war, they said, with the same
nationalist fervor as their comrades, the soldiers. They include:
</P>
<P>
   Doan Cong Tinh, 57, a tough combat photographer who spent more
than two years living under fire in Quang Tri, capturing some of
the most dramatic battlefield pictures from the northern side. He
said he had carried a firearm as well as his camera and used both
of them.
</P>
<P>
   Le Minh Truong, 70, who took up photography after he was wounded
fighting the French in the 1950s, then discovered beauty everywhere
he looked, in the flare of napalm or the contrails of U.S.
warplanes in the rubble of Hanoi or the silhouettes of jungle
fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Mai Nam, 69, whose picture of a U.S. bomber tumbling through the
sky, a parachute floating nearby, was reproduced as a postcard by
the government with the caption, ``Happy New Year 1967.'' When
peace came, he became a pioneer in photographing beauty pageants in
communist Vietnam, and his walls are now adorned by pictures, not
of war, but of beautiful women.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen Dinh Uu, 82, who took his first pictures in 1948 when he
helped capture a unit of French soldiers and then turned their own
camera on them. ``Oh, I was so happy,'' he said, recalling the day
he first held a camera in his hands. ``We were more alive in
wartime, working in the border between life and death.''
</P>
<P>
   Lam Tan Tai, 65, a master of battlefield photo-processing, who
carried his chemicals with him, built little earthen darkrooms and
hung his negatives on the bushes to dry.
</P>
<P>
   And Duong Thanh Phong, 61, who spent the war documenting life in
the hidden tunnels of Cu Chi, just south of Saigon. Then, in the
greatest thrill of his life, he photographed the final day of the
war, April 30, 1975, as victorious guerrillas and their supporters
surged toward the South's capital with flags and guns and laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Those pictures of victory are a revealing counterpart to the
familiar scenes of terrified Vietnamese in Saigon fighting their
way onto evacuation helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Today, most of these photographers are little known even in
their own country. Much of their wartime work has been uncollected
and unused since its original publication decades ago in Vietnamese
and some foreign communist newspapers. Some has never been
published, and some of the photographers have little left besides
the negatives they put aside for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   For these photographers, the ignorance is mutual: the work and
names of their Western counterparts is all but unknown to them.
</P>
<P>
   At his little house in Ho Chi Minh City, Tinh, the Quang Tri
photographer, pulled stacks of crumbling newspapers from under a
cupboard, pointing to his byline as he opened each one, murmuring
his name as if he, too, had been hidden from view all these years.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his pictures, crudely mounted with tape years ago, were
stuck together and would not come apart without tearing. Some were
blurred by yellow spots of mold.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has always been my dream to exhibit my pictures,'' he said.
``But as you know, the years after the war were very difficult here
and nobody had the money for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this is also because the government _ like the
photographers themselves _ viewed their work as part of the war
effort, a project that could be forgotten now that it had served
its purpose.
</P>
<P>
   In the interviews, the photographers acknowledged with pride
that their pictures were deliberately one-sided, that they were
fighting as hard with their cameras as the soldiers were with their
guns.
</P>
<P>
   And for the most part, their wartime propaganda _ often stunning
to look at _ is as genuinely descriptive of the conflict as were
some of the great U.S. pictures of battlefield horror or anti-war
protests.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most beautiful of these was shot by Uu: a file of
young soldiers heading for the front surrounded by adoring
schoolchildren. The smiles on both side are radiant and clearly
genuine, if, perhaps, not entirely spontaneous.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this picture the soldiers understood the purpose of my
work,'' said Uu. ``We were all soldiers together, and we had a
common determination to win against the Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Nam, who photographed the falling bomber, put it this way: ``I
never had any doubts about my work because I never set up any scene
for propaganda. What i took was reality, but it was just one side
of reality.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said: ``After a bombing raid we never showed the
dead bodies lying in the road. Instead we took pictures of people
rushing to fill the holes, to show that bombs are terrible but our
road to the front is still open.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no question that their work was dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some photographers were assigned to the front but they didn't
go,'' said Truong. ``Nine out of 10 people who went never came
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Tinh was perhaps the most enthusiastic of them all in covering
combat, sometimes rolling onto his back, he said, to fire his gun
at a circling helicopter. Some of his pictures are blurred because
he was photographing on the run as he joined in a charge on an
enemy position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked my assignment,'' he said. ``There were big battles in
that area with America, many famous places that have left an echo
in history, like Kon Tien and Khe Sanh.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his most striking pictures shows communist soldiers
raising their flag over a captured bunker, with the bodies of South
Vietnamese soldiers lying around it. Another shows a communist
soldier warily checking two badly wounded South Vietnamese troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three times I was completely covered by dirt from an exploding
shell,'' Tinh said. ``Two of my close friends died. I'm alive now
only by luck. I loved taking pictures like this.''
</P>
<P>
   But nothing could match the excitement of Phong, who hitched a
ride into Saigon on the last day of the war, leaving behind the Cu
Chi tunnels where he had lived for years under the endless thudding
of enemy bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were so thrilled,'' he said. ``It was such a happy day.
Everybody was on the streets laughing and singing.''
</P>
<P>
   He hitched a ride for the 30-mile trip to Saigon, stopping often
to photograph the fighters in black who milled about openly now,
their rifles in their hands.
</P>
<P>
   The most evocative shot from that ride shows a two-lane road
filled with hundreds of pairs of military boots, discarded by South
Vietnamese soldiers who ripped off their uniforms to try to mingle
with civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Phong said that he had also taken pictures of the fleeing
soldiers in their underwear but that he had thought them too
embarrassing to print.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just standing at the back of the car, shooting backwards
as we headed into the city,'' he said. ``The car was going voom,
voom, voom as we drove over the boots, like a boat going over
waves. I was just happy. Happy. It was fun driving over the boots,
bumping up and down.''

BUSH PROPOSES $1.7 BILLION PLAN TO ENCOURAGE LOW-INCOME HOUSING 
</HEADLINE>
  By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TROY, Mich. _ Adding to a series of recent proposals that he
says are designed to give low-income people a firmer purchase on
the American dream, Gov. George W. Bush unveiled a new plan Tuesday
for the federal government to encourage private developers to build
and rehabilitate houses in run-down, struggling neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The incentive would be money: $1.7 billion, over five years, in
tax credits for developers who take on the construction or
reconstruction of houses in neighborhoods where families make no
more than 80 percent of the median family income for that area.
</P>
<P>
   Bush estimated that the new program would facilitate work on as
many as 20,000 houses a year. More important, he said, it would
introduce to an increasing number of Americans the experience of
home ownership, which he described as a fundamental aspiration that
should be more easily attainable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the American dream is owning your own home,'' Bush
said as he stood in front of a newly built house in Battle Creek,
in western Michigan, with its owner, a 67-year-old black woman
named Oberrion Gibson. ``Part of the American dream is saying: This
place is mine.''
</P>
<P>
   In recognition of that, Bush said, he continually asks _ and
tries to answer _ ``How do I help people own? Not just those who
are entrepreneurs or those at the top of the economic ladder. But
how do we help every willing heart, everybody in America, own a
piece of this great land? And I've got some ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   The details of the one he introduced Tuesday, along with the
language and symbols with which he promoted it, adhered to the
pattern that emerged the moment the Texas governor sewed up the
Republican presidential nomination last month.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, in a clear bid for moderate swing voters, Bush has
been tackling issues traditionally dominated by Democrats, pitching
modest programs targeted at low-income Americans, framing these
initiatives as the actions of a new kind of Republican and
stressing the compassion that he links to his conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has also been spending, or at least promoting it, to a
degree that has many political analysts questioning how he can
afford his proposals while also pushing through a suggested tax cut
of $483 billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Gore said Tuesday that the numbers were simply not
adding up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He keeps making promises he can't pay for, because of his
enormous tax give-away for the rich,'' said Doug Hattaway, a
spokesman for the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But former Indianapolis Mayor Stephen Goldsmith, Bush's chief
domestic policy adviser, said that the governor's arithmetic was
sound, in part because of projections for federal surpluses, and in
part because of upcoming proposals Bush will make for ways the
government can save money.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the reforms that we have in mind,'' Goldsmith said, ``all
of this will fit into the budget box.''
</P>
<P>
   The housing plan that Bush outlined also brought into sharper
focus his views on the role of the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Bush does not, for the most part, want the federal government to
provide or administer services directly; he wants to use the tax
code and other financial incentives to make it easier for
low-income Americans to use the private sector to meet their needs.
Last week, for example, Bush proposed tax credits to help
low-income Americans purchase private health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   He also advocated several forms of assistance to help low-income
Americans buy their own houses. He said Tuesday that while those
housing initiatives addressed demand, Tuesday's initiative rounded
out the picture by addressing supply. Taken together, the
initiatives totaled $3.7 billion over five years. The newest
proposal would allow developers to apply for as much as 50 percent
of the cost of their work on certain houses in tax credits.
</P>
<P>
   The houses in question would have to be for people making no
more than 80 percent of the median family income in their area _
nationally, the median is about $51,000 _ and living in
neighborhoods where most residents fall into the same income
bracket.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the plan, which Bush's aides said could contribute
to the building or rehabilitation of 100,000 houses over five
years, would be limited. There are about 1.3 million new houses
built in America each year.
</P>
<P>
   But Goldsmith said that the new housing initiative, like the
others, is a supplement to an array of existing federal housing
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not aiming today to solve the nation's housing
problems,'' he said. ``What we've proposed over the last week is a
bucket of new tools.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign said that the vice president has proposed an
additional $5.7 million of federal assistance, over 10 years, to
help states build 180,000 new apartments or houses, including
rentals, for low-income people. Gore also supports an additional
$690 million over 10 years to help 120,000 low-income families with
housing vouchers to subsidize their rent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bush's initiatives are specifically aimed at home ownership,
which he described as a catalyst for safer streets and better
schools.
</P>
<P>
   As the governor spoke, he stood on the front porch of Gibson's
three-bedroom house, built with the aid of a private program that
gave her a low-interest mortgage. Five of her relatives and
acquaintances, all of them black, flanked the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been dribbling out his latest policies, a strategy
designed to give him something new to say every few days. And he
has been choosing the settings of his remarks with care.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan, with 18 electoral votes, is one of the most important
links in a chain of largely midwestern states that may be the
decisive region in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Bush lost the state's Republican primary to Sen. John McCain of
Arizona, an outcome that both Bush and Michigan Gov. John Engler,
who accompanied Bush from Battle Creek to subsequent campaign stops
in the Detroit suburbs of Dearborn and Troy, joked about Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back to the firewall!'' Engler trumpeted as he walked down the
aisle of the Bush campaign plane, referring facetiously to the
assurances he had given Bush that Michigan would halt McCain's
momentum coming out of the New Hampshire primary.

MIRANDA ON TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You have the right to remain silent and to an attorney _ at
least for now.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, Miranda rights go on trial. The Supreme Court
will hear arguments about whether to overturn Miranda v. Arizona,
the 1966 ruling that confessions can't be used against criminal
defendants unless they are informed of their rights.
</P>
<P>
   Despite loud critics, Miranda rights deserve fierce protection
from the court. Miranda grows out of the Constitution's Fifth
Amendment protection against self-incrimination. And it ensures
that even in the most heinous cases _ namesake Ernesto Miranda was
found guilty of kidnapping and rape _ the law proceeds in a just
and consistent fashion.
</P>
<P>
   To some, Miranda seems like a sop to criminals. Police can't
start an interrogation until they essentially hand over a
get-out-of-jail-free card: the right to remain silent. Dismantle
such absurd protections, the thinking goes, and the police _ as
well as the public _ will have a better fighting chance against
crime.
</P>
<P>
   This sounds like common sense. In the Miranda ruling, however,
the Supreme Court wisely stood against giving government that much
power:
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . our accusatory system of criminal justice demands that
the government seeking to punish an individual produce the evidence
against him by its own independent labors, rather than by the
cruel, simple expedient of compelling it from his own mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   In the bright light of this principle, it's easy to see how
deformed investigations can be, ranging from the Salem witch trials
to modern-day coerced confessions.
</P>
<P>
   The threat to Miranda is a 1968 federal law that says
confessions are admissible as evidence as long as they are
voluntary. Confessors need not be informed of their rights. In
addition to setting off alarm bells about constitutional violations
of the Fifth Amendment, this law has never been enforced by the
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   By setting a higher standard, Miranda rights inevitably apply to
society's worst felons, and a few may go free. But every time a
false confession is coerced, an individual's rights are violated _
and the real criminal goes unpunished. Miranda deserves to stay a
part of crime-fighting in America.

ENGAGING CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The politics of House minority leader Richard Gephardt's
decision to oppose permanent normal trade relations with China may
be complex or opaque, but the policy question at issue is as
unambiguous as these matters can be. It is in America's interest
for Congress to approve the measure.
</P>
<P>
   As President Clinton's trade representative, Charlene
Barshefsky, recently told members of the Globe editorial board, the
vote that Gephardt and his fellow members of Congress will cast
toward the end of May will not grant Beijing entry to the World
Trade Organization or access to American markets. The only question
to be decided by that vote is whether America will be able to
benefit from China's accession to the WTO and from laborious
negotiations that opened Chinese markets to American goods and
services.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules of the WTO, each member must grant every other
member unconditional, permanent normal trading rights.
</P>
<P>
   If Gephardt has his way and the House votes down permanent
normal trading rights for China, America would find itself in the
ludicrous position of having opened Chinese markets to the rest of
the world while becoming the only country with no legal right to
those markets.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt and others say they are wary of Beijing's repressive
behavior, and there is a lot not to like about the house that Mao
built. But China has come a long way since Mao, and a vote against
permanent normal trade relations with China would do nothing to
free advocates of democracy from Chinese prisons, liberate
exploited workers, or alleviate the oppression of Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
   The path to better Chinese behavior lies in engaging China in
the rules of free trade, the WTO, open markets, and the
communications revolution. There are 12 million Internet users in
China today; five years from now that number is expected to grow to
120 million users. Communism has already demonstrated that it is
not fit to survive alongside unfettered communication. Gephardt
should realize that a vote to open China's markets is a vote to
loosen political oppression.

AN EVEN HAND AT IRS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internal Revenue Service, by auditing proportionally more
returns from low-income filers than from the wealthy, is
threatening its own future. Fairness and the appearance of fairness
are essential to the successful operation of a tax system that is
heavily dependent on voluntary compliance.
</P>
<P>
   The question has been put back on the table by an IRS report
issued last week saying that it had audited 1.36 percent of returns
filed by people making less than $25,000 annually compared with
1.15 percent of those over $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is relatively minor, and the IRS attributed it to
more complete employer reporting of income details by higher-income
taxpayers, coupled with a reduction in allowable deductions from
taxable income.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has contributed to the problem by refusing to provide
adequate funding for IRS personnel to keep up with population
increases and consequent rises in the number of returns filed. That
has spread IRS enforcement personnel ever more thinly, but such
reductions make it even more imperative that, within reason, they
focus on cases where they are apt to generate more revenue. It is
particularly galling to have congressional critics of the tax
system sabotage it by providing inadequate funding for efficient
operation.
</P>
<P>
   There is a fine line between enforcement for its own sake and
enforcement designed to advertise the fact that the IRS is alert to
dodges used by taxpayers to avoid paying their fair share. It is
legitimate on both grounds to examine closely at least a sampling
of returns from all income levels. But it undercuts the sense of
fairness and of even-handedness to focus even slightly more
attention on lower-income taxpayers when many people feel that
higher-income taxpayers get better advice and know more ways to
shelter income from taxation.
</P>
<P>
   The American tax system is one of the best in the world, in
large part because most taxpayers comply voluntarily with its
provisions. Maintaining that record depends on confidence in its
general fairness _ and that deserves very high priority at the IRS
and in Congress.

DESTROYING ZIMBABWE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The African nation of Zimbabwe celebrated its 20th year of
independence Tuesday. After a cruel war against white-ruled
Rhodesia, which had unilaterally and illegally declared
independence from Britain in order to maintain itself in power, an
African guerrilla army prevailed. Rhodesia, which was named for the
arch-imperialist Cecil Rhodes, passed into history, and Zimbabwe,
named for an ancient African civilization, was born in promise and
the spirit of racial reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   Today most of Zimbabwe's prosperity and promise have been
squandered. Landless Africans are being incited to racial violence,
white farmers are being murdered in their homes, and African
opposition officials are being killed as well.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation is running at 70 percent, unemployment is approaching
50 percent, and Zimbabwean soldiers are making mischief in
neighboring Congo.
</P>
<P>
   The blame for all this rests squarely on the shoulders of Robert
Mugabe, who, having led his country to victory and freedom, now
clings desperately to power, defying the rule of law, stalling on
elections, and generally contributing to his country's ruin.
</P>
<P>
   In February Mugabe held a referendum designed to keep him in
power and allow him to confiscate white-owned farms without
compensation. The referendum was defeated, but Mugabe rammed it
through his rubber-stamp legislature anyway.
</P>
<P>
   He encouraged squatters to break the law and occupy white farms,
which are vital to the economy, even though Zimbabwe's courts
branded the occupations illegal and ordered the occupiers out.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, hours after a second white farmer had been gunned down
_ his home burned to the ground by squatters _ Mugabe used the
independence day ceremony to tell white farmers: ``Our present
state of mind is that you are our enemies . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   It is a sad twist of history to witness Mugabe, who prevailed
over an illegal and racist authority 20 years ago, fast becoming an
illegal and racist authority himself.

HIGH COURT SETS ASIDE 2 QUESTIONABLE DEATH SENTENCES IN VIRGINIA 
</HEADLINE>
   By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Tuesday set aside the death
sentences of two convicted murderers in Virginia, indicating in two
separate decisions that despite the sharp restrictions imposed on
federal courts by a 1996 law, federal judges still have a
significant role to play in reviewing the quality of justice
administered by the states.
</P>
<P>
   One of the decisions unanimously granted a new hearing on
allegations of juror bias and prosecutorial misconduct to an inmate
who was 50 minutes away from execution when the Supreme Court
intervened in October to grant a stay and accept his case for
review.
</P>
<P>
   The second decision was a splintered ruling that was
considerably more equivocal as the court grappled with the
ambiguously worded core provisions of the 1996 law, the
Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act.
</P>
<P>
   By a 5-4 vote, the court accepted the view of the law's
supporters that federal judges must defer even to a state court
decision they regard as incorrect, as long as the decision was not
``unreasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, the court was unanimous in rejecting a
definition of ``unreasonable'' that as a practical matter would
have meant that federal courts would have almost never been able to
review state court rulings. Applying the law, the court then voted
6-3 that the inmate was entitled to a new sentencing hearing
because his lawyer's performance at the original hearing fell below
constitutionally minimum standards of competence.
</P>
<P>
   Both decisions were coincidentally, and confusingly, named
Williams vs. Taylor; the inmate in the first case, No. 99-6615, is
Michael W. Williams, and in the second case, No. 98-8384, the
inmate is Terry Williams. John B. Taylor is the warden of the
Sussex State Prison in Waverly, Va., where both are housed.
</P>
<P>
   Both cases happened to be death penalty appeals, coming at a
time of heightened public concern over the fairness of the way
capital punishment is applied. But the court was interpreting
statutory provisions that apply across the board and are not
limited to the death penalty. While it is unusual for the court to
overturn two death sentences on a single day, there was no
suggestion that the court is reassessing its stance toward capital
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Since the retirement of Justice Harry A. Blackmun in 1994, no
member of the court has taken a position of blanket opposition to
the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The two decisions were the court's most important rulings to
date on the meaning of the 1996 law, by which Congress sought to
limit the authority of federal courts to grant petitions for writs
of habeas corpus. These petitions, challenging the
constitutionality of a conviction or sentence, are the only source
of federal jurisdiction over state criminal convictions and have
long been a target of those seeking to curb federal authority over
the states.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat surprisingly for the current Supreme Court, which in
many ways has helped marshal the attack on federal habeas corpus,
Tuesday's decisions amounted to a rebuff of the conservative
federal appeals court that has most aggressively picked up that
battle cry, the 4th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, in Richmond, Va.
Both decisions overturned 4th Circuit rulings.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Another 4th Circuit decision, a ruling last year that declared
the Supreme Court's Miranda decision to no longer be good law, will
be the subject of an argument before the justices Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Michael Williams, the question was whether he was
entitled to a U.S. District Court hearing to present evidence that
had not been developed in his earlier state court proceedings. The
U.S. District Court in Richmond originally said he was entitled to
a hearing on several issues, including a prosecutor's possible
misconduct during the 1994 murder trial in failing to reveal his
knowledge that there was reason to suspect a juror of bias.
</P>
<P>
   But before the scheduled hearing could take place, the 4th
Circuit ruled that Williams was not entitled to it because he had
``failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in state court
proceedings.'' The meaning of the phrase ``failed to develop,''
from the 1996 law, was the central issue in the Supreme Court's
consideration of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Williams had not presented these issues in the Virginia
courts because, he said, the state itself suppressed the facts and
made essential evidence unavailable to him. In the view of the 4th
Circuit, the reason for the failure was immaterial; if an inmate
had ``failed to develop'' his claim, there could be no evidentiary
hearing in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   In his unanimous opinion overturning that ruling Tuesday,
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said this was a misuse of the word
``fail,'' which he said ``connotes some omission, fault, or
negligence on the pat of the person who has failed to do
something.'' Had Congress wanted to adopt a ``no-fault reading of
the statute,'' Kennedy said, ``it would have had to do no more than
use, in lieu of the phrase `has failed to,' the phrase `did not.'
''
</P>
<P>
   The proper question, Kennedy continued, was ``whether the
prisoner made a reasonable attempt, in light of the information
available at the time, to investigate and pursue claims in state
court,'' not on whether the effort was successful.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in the Terry Williams case was a different section of
the 1996 law, defining the scope of federal court review of state
court judgments. The law provides that in reviewing a habeas corpus
petition, the federal court cannot set aside a state court decision
unless the decision ``was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable
application of, clearly established federal law, as determined by
the Supreme Court of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   According to the 4th Circuit, a state court decision could be
considered unreasonable only if it interpreted or applied the
relevant precedent ``in a manner that reasonable jurists would all
agree in unreasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Supreme Court was split on other issues in the
case, all nine justices agreed that the 4th Circuit's definition
was incorrect. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who wrote the
controlling opinion in interpreting the provision's central
phrases, said the question should be whether the state court's
decision was ``objective unreasonable.'' She said: ``The federal
habeas court should not transform the inquiry into a subjective one
by resting its determination instead on the simple fact that at
least one of the nation's jurists has applied the relevant federal
law in the same manner the state court did in the habeas
petitioner's case.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said that while the word ``unreasonable'' was ``no
doubt difficult to define,'' it was ``a common term in the legal
world and, accordingly, federal judges are familiar with its
meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   It was after this point that the two factions on the court
diverged. O'Connor, whose opinion was joined by Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist and by Justices Kennedy, Antonin Scalia, and
Clarence Thomas, said that ``for purposes of today's opinion, the
most important point is that an  &UR; unreasonable &LR;  application of
federal law is different from an  &UR; incorrect &LR;  application of federal
law.'' A federal court could not grant the writ just because the
state court decision was wrong, though reasonable, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice John Paul Stevens, in an opinion joined by Justices
David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer, said
that it remained ``the federal courts' independent responsibility''
to interpret federal law. If Congress had intended federal courts
to defer even to decisions they regarded as incorrect, he said, the
1996 law would have said so clearly, rather than by indirection.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The law has caused considerable confusion because it is a
pastiche of various provisions, some amended at the last moment and
lacking in legislative history.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said that ``only a narrow category of cases'' would
likely be affected by the difference in interpretation between him
and O'Connor. Several liberal critics of the 1996 law agreed with
that prediction Tuesday, noting that the court had already set the
bar very high for habeas corpus relief and the most important
aspect of Tuesday's decision was the demonstration that, however
the standard was phrased, it had enough teeth to matter. The vote
to grant Terry Williams' petition was 6-3, with Rehnquist, Scalia
and Thomas dissenting on the ground that his legal representation,
even if inadequate, had probably not made a difference to the
outcome of his sentencing hearing.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Doctor's orders: Reunite father, son
 &HT;    (EDs: This is an editorial from Wednesday's Atlanta
Constitution.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _There's nothing equivocal about Dr. Irwin Redlener's
warning that ``Elian Gonzalez is now in a state of imminent danger
to his physical and emotional well-being in a home that I consider
to be psychologically abusive.'' Redlener's opinion, in his
capacity as consultant to Attorney General Janet Reno, ought to
spur the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta to rule
promptly to lift an emergency order preventing Elian's removal from
the home of his Miami relatives so he can be reunited with his
father and they can go back to their Cuban homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Redlener hasn't met face to face with the 6-year-old
shipwreck survivor. However, the New York pediatrician and mental
health specialists recruited by him have interviewed Elian's
great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzales, and the boy's father, Juan Miguel
Gonzales. They also have studied a videotape released to the media
last week by the Miami relatives in which Elian states he doesn't
wish to return to Cuba _ a response Redlener likened to that of a
hostage.
</P>
<P>
   The impression conveyed by Elian's father was ``very open, very
caring.'' As for Elian's great uncle, ``he does love the boy, but
he ... has too many other concerns with the (Cuban exile)
community,'' according to Dr. Lourdes Rigual-Lynch, a New York
psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   Especially damaging to Elian, in Redlener's estimation, are the
unsubstantiated threats to the boy's well-being suggested by his
Miami relatives. The uncle charges the father was abusive to Elian
and his late mother, a claim that's hard to credit since her
mother, Elian's grandmother, wants the boy returned to his father.
And then there's Lazaro's daughter, who has stated Elian will be
tortured if he is returned to Cuba, a ridiculous assertion
considering the heroic status the boy enjoys there.
</P>
<P>
   Reuniting Elian with his father would be consistent with
immigration law and procedure. It observes a centuries-old
precedent that a biological parent has the right to choose where
his child will live unless that parent is disqualified for reasons
of neglect or abuse, an exception that doesn't apply in this case.
The mental health imperative is all the more reason for the 11th
Court of Appeals to expedite Elian's return to his father's arms.

   Pop Concerts in Tuscany
</P>
<P>
   Q. We will be in Italy in July and would like to get a schedule
for the popular concert series in Lucca. Can we purchase tickets in
advance?
</P>
<P>
   A. Lucca, about 10 miles north of Pisa in Tuscany, is best known
for the 500-year-old walls encircling it and for being the
birthplace of Puccini. But for the third consecutive summer, it
will be the host to some rock and pop musicians. The first two
years featured such performers as Bob Dylan, Joe Cocker, Elton John
and the Backstreet Boys, with 54,000 people attending the 10
concerts last year.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Summer Festival Lucca 2000 is expected to offer
10 more concerts, from July 7 to 27, in the city's major piazzas.
Not all the concerts have been set, but here is the schedule so
far:
</P>
<P>
   July 11, Alanis Morissette, Piazza Napoleone; July 17, The
Cranberries, Piazza Napoleone; July 18, Buena Vista Social Club,
Piazza Anfiteatro; July 19, Joe Cocker, Piazza Anfiteatro; July 20,
Joan Baez, Piazza Anfiteatro; July 22, Natalie Cole, Piazza
Anfiteatro; and July 26, Bryan Ferry, Piazza Anfiteatro.
</P>
<P>
   The producers, D'Alessandro e Galli, say the concerts start at
9:30 p.m. and go till midnight. Ticket prices have not been set at
this writing, but last year ranged from about $26 to $48, and the
organizers say tickets should again start around $25.
</P>
<P>
   More information and tickets are available by calling (39-0584)
30335, and after May tickets will also be sold at several locations
in the city.
</P>
<P>
   A Czech Spa Town
</P>
<P>
   Q. My parents used to vacation in Carlsbad, now Karlovy Vary,
the Czech Republic, and I would like to retrace their footsteps.
Can you tell me about traveling there and accommodations?
</P>
<P>
   A. Karlovy Vary, about 75 miles west of Prague near the German
border, has been a noted spa for centuries. A hundred years ago,
Karlsbad (its German name) was part of any grand tour of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Under communism, it became a vacation destination not for the
rich but for the workers of the Soviet Union, and much of the
grandeur was hidden. In the last decade, the town has been trying
to regain its former image as a more upscale center of culture and
relaxation. Kamila Jancikova, manager of trade relations for the
Czech Tourist Authority in New York, said, ``There are theater,
cinema and concerts all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   While Karlovy Vary's fortunes remain tied to the dozen warm
springs used ``to take the cure,'' the town is also known for its
annual international film festival, the 35th edition of which is
scheduled July 5 to 15 this year. It also is the host of the 17th
annual international jazz festival, featuring the Scott Hamilton
Quartet, May 21 to 27. There is a golf course, and lots of hiking
in the hills of the Slavkov Forest.
</P>
<P>
   The best place to start planning a trip to Karlovy Vary is the
Czech Tourist Authority, 1109 Madison Ave., New York, N.Y. 10028;
(212) 288-0830, fax (212) 288-0971; the Web site is
www.czechcenter.com.
</P>
<P>
   CSA Czech Airlines, (800) 223-2365, flies from Newark to Prague
daily in summer, but only three times a week in winter; daily
flights start June 17. Round-trip fares from Newark to Prague, for
a stay of 7 to 30 days, are $958 to $1,015 from May 28 to June 17,
then rise to $998 to $1,058.
</P>
<P>
   There are no connecting flights to Karlovy Vary from Prague, but
buses make the 2-hour 20-minute trip five times a day, leaving the
Florenc terminal at 9:30 a.m. and 12:30, 3:30, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.
There are at least four return trips daily. Tickets cost $16 each
way in Prague or around $41 round trip when bought with a Czech
Airlines ticket in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Among the dozens of hotels in Karlovy Vary, the grande dame is
the Grandhotel Pupp, an elegant 299-year-old institution. Its best
rooms were renovated a few years ago and the others are to be
remodeled next year. The rates for its 225 rooms and suites range
from $80 to $240 a person a night, but are higher during festivals
and at holidays. Information and reservations: Grandhotel Pupp
Karlovy Vary, Mirove Namesti 2, 360 91 Karlovy Vary, Czech
Republic; (420-17) 310-9111, fax (420-17) 322-6638, and at
www.pupp.cz.
</P>
<P>
   Another elegant choice is the Hotel Richmond, Slovenska 3, 360
01 Karlovy Vary; (420-17) 322-6326, fax (420-17) 322-2169;
www.richmond.cz. Its 76 rooms have TV and minibars. The rate,
including breakfast, is $38 to $72 a person.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel Dvorak, Nova Louka 11, 360 21 Karlovy Vary, (420-17)
322-4145, fax (420-17) 322-2814, Web site www.hotel-dvorak.cz,
offers 79 air-conditioned rooms, with TV, minibars and hair dryers.
Doubles run about $50 to $75 a person.
</P>
<P>
   Packages at these hotels, like most in the city, include spa
treatments. For information and reservations see
www.travelguide.cz.
</P>
<P>
   Cathedrals and Choirs
</P>
<P>
   Q. We are interested in visiting some of Britain's cathedrals
and hearing their choirs sing at services. Do you know of companies
that offer tours including such opportunities?
</P>
<P>
   A. There seem to be surprisingly few companies with such tours
for individuals, though many arrange group tours for choirs.
Perhaps your best bet is Lord Addison Travel, Post Office Box 307,
Peterborough, N.H. 03458; (800) 326-0170, fax (603) 924-9211;
www.lordaddison.com.
</P>
<P>
   Dana Huntley, the company's president, says that it runs about
60 themed tours a year to Britain and that many visit cathedrals,
where choral evensong can be heard on most nights. An example is
the Kent and 1066 Country Tour, Oct. 5 to 14, which will visit St.
Paul's Cathedral in London and cathedrals in Rochester and
Canterbury. The Wells and the Cotswolds Tour, Oct. 19 to 28, visits
cathedrals in Salisbury and Wells, and churches in Cirencester and
Oxford.
</P>
<P>
   These tours, with air fare from Boston, New York or
Philadelphia, cost $2,770 and $2,780, double occupancy. The
land-only cost is $2,290, and includes full English breakfast and
dinner daily, all admission fees, minibus transportation and
lodging in hotels with local flavor, Huntley said. He added that
his company would customize tours.
</P>
<P>
   If you wish to tour on your own, the brochure Singing in
Cathedrals, published by the Friends of Cathedral Music, lists
music schedules and other information about cathedrals all over
Britain and Ireland. It is available from the British Tourist
Authority, 551 Fifth Ave., New York N.Y. 10176; (800) 462-2748, fax
(212) 986-1188; www.visitbritain.com.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Affordable housing proposal
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush, appealing anew Tuesday to voters who have tended
to support Democrats, proposed a $1.7 billion program to increase
housing for low-income people. It would give a tax credit up to 50
percent to developers to refurbish existing houses. Bush was
campaigning in Michigan, where he lost the Republican primary to
John McCain in February. He made his proposal outside the house of
Oberrion Gibson in Battle Creek, who had lived there for 34 years
before tearing down her old home and rebuilding with low-interest
financing provided by a neighborhood development group.
</P>
<P>
   RACE TIGHTENS IN MICHIGAN
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush is in a tight race with Al Gore in Michigan,
according to a survey of likely voters released by Epic/MRA Inc., a
polling company in Lansing. The poll showed Bush with a 43 percent
to 42 percent edge. In December the same poll had Bush up 52
percent to 38 percent, said Edward Sarpolus, vice president of
Epic/MRA. The poll's margin of error is 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS ALSO DIFFICULT FOR ANOTHER REASON
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan holds rallies Tuesday night in Irving, Texas, and
today in Houston as the Buchanan Brigade opens a three-week battle
to get the Reform Party candidate on the November ballot in Texas.
Calling it the ``toughest state in the nation'' for an independent
or third-party candidate, Buchanan is mustering volunteers, hired
guns and campaign staff to gather 56,000 petition signatures by May
8. Texas is difficult because of the large number of signatures
required and little time to circulate petitions. Only the
signatures of registered voters who did not vote in a party primary
or sign any other ballot-access petition are valid.
</P>
<P>
   SECOND CHANCE ON FLAG ISSUE
</P>
<P>
   John McCain will fly this morning to Columbia, S.C., where he
will attempt to mend his one campaign regret by condemning the
Confederate flag flying atop the state Capitol. In what he is
calling a ``speech on conservative reform,'' McCain will speak at
noon at a South Carolina restaurant, alongside Rep. Lindsey Graham,
R-S.C., one of his chief backers in the state. The online magazine
Salon reports that McCain will support a compromise bill passed
last week by the state Senate that would move the flag from atop
the Capitol dome to a Confederate soldiers' memorial on state
grounds. During the primary campaign, McCain took the same position
as George W. Bush, saying only that the decision was best left up
to the people.
</P>
<P>
   GORE TESTED IN JERSEY MARSH
</P>
<P>
   With Earth Day fast approaching, Cox News Service's Scott
Shepard reports that Al Gore is facing a situation that could test
his environmental credentials. The Mills Corp. of Virginia, whose
executives and associates have given $43,000 to Gore's presidential
campaign, want to develop a shopping center on 90 acres of wetlands
in New Jersey's Meadowlands. But the mall project is opposed by
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent environmentalist who has
endorsed Gore as ``the strongest environmentalist running for the
White House since Teddy Roosevelt.'' The Meadowlands Mills project
has thus become a possible litmus test for Gore's environmental
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   WHISTLEBLOWER SUIT NAMES BUSH
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush has been named a defendant in a lawsuit by the
fired head of the Texas Funeral Service Commission. She accuses him
of conspiring to impede a 1998 investigation of a company that had
given him campaign contributions. Eliza May says she lost her job
over an investigation of Houston-based Service Corporation
International. She filed her wrongful termination lawsuit last year
and has amended it to include Bush. The company, one of the world's
largest funeral home and cemetery operators, is headed by Bush
family friend Robert Waltrip, who contributed $45,000 to Bush's
gubernatorial campaigns, according to the lawsuit. Waltrip also has
been a trustee for the George H.W. Bush Presidential Library in
College Station and donated more than $100,000 through his company
toward construction.
</P>
<P>
   WITH WIFE LIDDY OUT, TOO, WHO'S LEFT?
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush won the public endorsement of 1996 GOP
presidential nominee Bob Dole, who made the announcement during an
MSNBC talk show. ``I endorse George Bush,'' Dole said, adding, ``I
think he is coming back to the (political) middle, which I think is
very important.'' Dole, whose wife Elizabeth dropped out of the
presidential race early on, had kept quiet during the primaries.
Since then, though, he's been playing liaison between Bush and John
McCain, a close Dole friend.
</P>
<P>
   THE GAP'S BACK _ AND WE DON'T MEAN KHAKIS
</P>
<P>
   The gender gap, in hibernation earlier in the presidential
campaign, is back and reportedly as big as ever. An ABC News
analysis found that the gap is not directly caused by differing
opinions between the sexes on specific issues or by demographic
differences. Instead, according to ABC: greater support among women
for a larger, more activist government; and a broad sense that the
Democratic Party is better attuned in general to the concerns of
women. The 2000 gender gap was minimal last fall, but has grown
considerably since then. In an ABC News-Washington Post poll last
week, Al Gore led among women by 10 points, while George W. Bush
led among men by the same amount _ a 20-point gap. Four years ago,
the gender gap was put at 17 points.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH REPORTS $1.3 MILLION INCOME
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush earned an estimated $1.3 million last year and
paid $514,000 in taxes, according to his campaign. He and wife
Laura donated $210,000 to churches and charities, including the
$130,000 in royalties from Bush's autobiography, ``A Charge to
Keep.'' Royalties from the book were earmarked for scouting and
other groups working with youth. Bush's income includes his
$115,345 salary as governor, and investment income from blind
trusts. Last week, Al and Tipper Gore disclosed paying $59,178 in
1999 income taxes on adjusted gross income of $240,792.
</P>
<P>
   VENTURA PRESSES, BUT MCCAIN SLIPS AWAY
</P>
<P>
   Meeting for the first time, Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura pressed
John McCain to resume his presidential campaign, but as an
independent. But McCain went into the meeting saying that no one _
not even Ventura _ could entice him to make such a move. ``I will
not leave the Republican Party,'' he said during a news conference
at the Mall of America before meeting Ventura. ``The Republican
Party is my home. Ventura, who's said he's unlikely to endorse Al
Gore or George W. Bush, repeated his sentiment that McCain could
win as an independent.
</P>
<P>
   BLACK MINISTERS FOR CORZINE
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen leading inner city black clerics in New Jersey
endorsed former Goldman Sachs CEO Jon Corzine for governor, calling
him the ``genuine hope'' for African-Americans. ``Jon Corzine has
given us every reason to believe that he is genuine,'' said the
Rev. Reginald Jackson in the Bergen Record. Jackson cited Corzine's
``promises to support affirmative action, oppose the death penalty,
lower public school class size, and bring about universal health
care and universal gun registration.'' Corzine is facing former
Gov. Jim Florio in the Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   DREAMWORKS TRIO PLANNING A BREAK
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood heavyweights Steven Spielberg, David Geffen and
Jeffrey Katzenberg, whose largess has swollen Democratic campaign
treasuries for years, will take a break from fund-raising after the
November presidential election. The the DreamWorks SKG studio
founders have been among the Democrats' most reliable funding
sources, regularly tapping their own bank accounts, as well as
twisting the arms of wealthy Hollywood colleagues. But DreamWorks
spokesman Andy Spahn says the trio plans to take a break after
working fervently this fall for Al Gore's election. During the
Clinton years, Spahn said, Dreamworks has probably raised more
money than anyone in the nation for Democratic candidates. A
Beverly Hills benefit held just last Saturday night brought in $2.8
million.
</P>
<P>
   `DOT-COM' VS. `DOT-ORG'
</P>
<P>
   At least a half-dozen for-profit political Internet sites are
now online, offering much the same blend of in-depth political
information as well as hot links to political and governmental
institutions. Cox News Service's Andrew J. Glass reported that
non-profit political Internet sites are warning that competing
commercial sites are threatening their existence, and that those
sites can expose citizens to special interests seeking to influence
voters and shape legislation. But defenders of the ``dot-com''
sites told a meeting of the Democracy Online Project that they were
merely increasing access to neutral political information, and
fears of the ``dot-orgs'' were unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   SEPARATION OF JUDGES AND CANDIDATE SPOUSES
</P>
<P>
   One for the political etiquette books: If you're a judge, and
your spouse is running for office, you should stay pretty well out
of the campaign _ even if you work in different states. Such was
the advisory from the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court for
Roanne Sragow, a Massachusetts District Court judge whose husband,
Richard Licht, is a Democrat running for the U.S. Senate in Rhode
Island. The opinion means that Sragow will not attend most campaign
events, and Licht told The New York Times that his wife would not
even attend his official campaign kick-off.
</P>
<P>
   BUT YOU DON'T GET TO ENDORSE AS A TICKET YET
</P>
<P>
   The head of John McCain's campaign in Michigan endorsed George
W. Bush _ and called for McCain to become Bush's running mate.
``George Bush is going to be the nominee, and it's time all
Republicans close ranks behind him,'' said state Sen. John Schwarz.
``I worked very hard for John McCain ... (the best thing) which
could happen now is Governor Bush would choose John McCain as his
running mate. And I wish Senator McCain would accept.''

 &HT;    See Rock City the dot-com way
 &HT;    By Howard Pousner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The See Rock City roadside barn, an American
advertising icon dating to the 1930s, is getting a new message fit
for a new millennium: www.seerockcity.com.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the first of what will be dozens of barn roofs was
painted with the attraction's Web address at the base of Lookout
Mountain in Wildwood, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tragedy of the Web world is people create great sites but
don't do a very good job of promoting them,'' says Rock City
marketing director Jim Gilliland.
</P>
<P>
   Rock City has always known something about selling. At its
roof-painting peak, more than 900 barns in 19 states sported the
``See Rock City'' slogan. Today, only about 80 barns remain, and
Gilliland expects at least half of them to be updated with the
digital message in the next 18 months, along with some new ones.
</P>
<P>
   The Web address is being painted in the standard white letters
on a black background _ and split onto three lines, with
SeeRockCity, in a bow to tradition, alone on the middle one.
</P>
<P>
   But some things don't change. Gilliland reports that while the
first www.seerockcity.com roof was being done, several neighboring
farmers approached Rock City officials and asked if their barns
could be painted, too.

 &HT;    CHILD EXPERTS BATTLE AMIDST THE WAR OVER ELIAN
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ With a crucial court ruling still pending, the war of
words over 6-year-old Cuban rafter Elian Gonzalez boiled over
Tuesday as child experts on both sides of the bitter custody battle
exchanged heated accusations over the boy's treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the child has been extremely manipulated,'' said Dr.
Irwin Redlener, a pediatrician appointed by Attorney General Janet
Reno to advise the government on how best to transfer Elian to his
father. ``In fact, it's almost like a hostage situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Redlener made the comments to reporters Tuesday, a day after he
sent a letter to Reno calling for the government to remove Elian
from the home of his Miami relatives immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elian Gonzalez is now in a state of imminent danger to his
physical and emotional well-being in a home that I consider to be
psychologically abusive,'' Redlener wrote in the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Redlener said his fears were based on the tense atmosphere
surrounding the home, where protesters have massed for weeks in a
round-the-clock vigil, and a controversial home video released by
the Miami relatives in which Elian told his father he doesn't want
to go back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, the boy's Miami supporters blasted Redlener in a
news conference held outside the Little Havana home.
</P>
<P>
   Such comments ``should not be made by people thousands or
hundreds of miles away, who have not even had telephone contact
with any of the parties involved,'' said Dr. Jose Carro(cq), head
of a local association of Cuban exile pediatricians.
</P>
<P>
   Carro noted that during a visit to Miami last week to meet with
the family, Redlener and two other child experts appointed by Reno
never met individually with Elian, and spent only about an hour
with his great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   The volley of accusations came as all sides in the
four-month-old drama awaited a key ruling from the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the court granted the Miami family's request for a
temporary ban on removing Elian from the United States. The family
then asked the court to extend the ban until it hears an appeal of
a lawsuit stemming from the case, which is scheduled for a May 11
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers asked the court to instead order
Elian reunited with his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who has been
living in the Washington, D.C. area at the home of a top Cuban
diplomat since April 6. Gonzalez has promised to remain in the U.S.
pending the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But Reno insists the boy will be reunited with his father no
matter how the court rules, and legal experts say she has the legal
authority to order the boy turned over.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez has said he will not block federal officers from
taking the boy, but that they will have to come to his home to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   That sets the stage for a tense showdown between federal
officers and the throngs of Cuban exile protesters. Last week
thousands jammed the neighborhood of modest homes when Reno's
initial deadline for handing over the boy approached, but the
situation lapsed into calm after the Atlanta court issued its
temporary order.
</P>
<P>
   Miami's exiles also blasted the media Tuesday, saying they have
been unfairly portrayed in reports as extremists bent on violent
protest. They also charged that officials from the Cuban Interests
Section in Washington scuffled with protesters last week, injuring
several people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our city, our people...and particularly Cuban-Americans have
been slandered and libeled,'' said Miami Mayor Joe Carollo, who
traveled to Washington Tuesday to protest the incident. ``These
diplomatic thugs make the Sopranos seem like the Vienna Boy's
Choir,'' he said, referring to the popular television program about
the American Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban-American representatives in Congress sent letters to the
State Department to complain about the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Fernandez, a spokesman for the Cuban Interests Section,
said Cuban diplomats would file their own protest with the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are hostile elements that are disrupting the normal
functions of the Cuban Interests Section,'' Fernandez said, while
declining to comment on the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, the Miami Herald reported that state and local
agencies _ police, fire and emergency rescue teams _ have spent
about $1 million on the standoff, mostly on overtime. The total
includes their actions in January when the initial federal order to
return Elian to his father prompted disturbances that led to more
than 100 arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the cost has been borne by the City of Miami, which
teetered on the brink of bankruptcy in 1996 due to poor fiscal
management and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Carollo blamed the expenditures on federal actions in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not our doing,'' he said. ``This is the doing of
federal policies. All we're doing is what local law enforcement has
to do.''

VIOLENCE AGAINST WHITE FARMERS MARKS INDEPENDENCE DAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also ZIMBABWE-POLITICS) 
 By HENRI E. CAUVIN

<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe _ Violence against white farmers here escalated
Tuesday on the 20th anniversary of this country's independence,
even as President Robert Mugabe said in a speech that he hoped to
soon see an end to the seething land standoff that has shaken his
country.
</P>
<P>
   In the worst of several attacks Tuesday, a white farmer died in
the morning after he was shot and subsequently beaten by a mob that
overran his farm in Nyamandhlovu, north of the southwestern city of
Bulawayo, officials of the country's Commercial Farmers Union said.
</P>
<P>
   The slaying of the farmer, Martin Olds, comes only four days
after another farmer died in a confrontation with some of the
thousands of squatters who have raided white-owned farms during the
past two months in and effort to retake land stolen decades ago by
white settlers.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Mugabe did not order the squatters to leave the
more than 600 farms they are occupying. But as he has done
repeatedly during this crisis, he sent seemingly mixed signals
Tuesday about his attitude toward the white farmers and the
direction he intends to take in dealing with them.
</P>
<P>
   Striking a conciliatory tone in his speech, which commemorated
20 years of independence and black majority rule, Mugabe said he
appreciates ``the pressures facing the farmers.''
</P>
<P>
   But later Tuesday, in an interview with state television, he
adopted a more confrontational stance, saying the farmers have
``behaved as enemies of Zimbabwe'' in ``coercing'' their workers to
support the new opposition party and in contesting a constitutional
amendment giving the government the right to seize white-owned land
without compensation. ``They are definite enemies in the sense of
wanting to reverse our revolution and our independence,'' Mugabe
said.
</P>
<P>
   If either message is taking hold among the masses occupying the
farms, it would appear to be the latter. The deadly confrontation
Tuesday was only the worst of the mayhem on a day that was one of
the worst so far in the protracted political standoff that has
turned increasingly menacing.
</P>
<P>
   In the Christon Bank area, north of here, a farmer was abducted
and brutally beaten before being rescued by the authorities several
hours later, said Richard Amyot, a deputy director of the farmers
union. Amyot also said that in another confrontation between a band
of loyal farm workers and squatters on a farm, the squatters
abducted the farm owner's adult son and then burned several
buildings, even after receiving 2,000 Zimbabwe dollars in exchange
for the son's release.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is horrifying,'' Amyot said as he rushed to the airport
for a flight to the scene of Tuesday morning's slaying.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The violence around the country came on a day the farmers hoped
would yield the breakthrough that has so far proved elusive.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the president called the leaders of the farmers union to
his office here in the capital for a surprise meeting. After
listening to their concerns and pressing his own, Mugabe told them
and the world that he hoped to broker an understanding between the
farmers and the war veterans who have been spearheading the farm
raids and end the occupations.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was to have been held Tuesday, but the president's
office said Tuesday afternoon that the session was delayed until
Wednesday because the government had realized the leaders of the
war veterans' association were scattered around the country and
would need more time to reach the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Tuesday's developments, the farmers union said it plans
to continue talks, but its leaders were astonished that Tuesday's
killing could have happened when it did. ``We're in the middle of
discussions with the highest authority in the land and then the
next morning this happens?'' Amyot asked rhetorically.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the two white farmers killed in the past week,
two black supporters of the new opposition party were killed when
their car was firebombed by apparent supporters of the president's
ruling ZANU-PF party.
</P>
<P>
   A delegation of top government ministers is to leave this week
for Britain to try to renew British commitments to aid Zimbabwe, a
former British colony, in efforts to redistribute land. ``It's a
make or break week,'' said the president's spokesman, George
Charamba.
</P>
<P>
   The countries have been sniping for months and relations have
been frosty, but the invitation by the British foreign secretary,
Robin Cook, to talk may be the beginning of a thaw that would go a
long way toward stabilizing Zimbabwe. ``We're moving from conflict
to a convergence of ideas, and that is the basis for the
president's optimism,'' Charamba said.

<P>
   KARACHI, Pakistan _ Raees Khan sleeps most nights on a pillow of
dust. His home is a median strip along busy Liaquadabad Road,
across from a mosque. A little before dawn a loudspeaker announces
the first call to prayer, a reminder to the holy that before Allah
all men are naught.
</P>
<P>
   This noisy summons fails to awaken Khan. Though a Muslim, he
does not pray five times a day. Other rituals command him: emptying
a tiny bag of heroin into a plastic bottle cap, adding water and
heating it on a small flame, drawing the hypnotic broth into a
syringe, hunting for a plump vein and feeding into it the fluid
warmth.
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of addiction, locating the vein is the hardest
part. Most of those conduits have long ago collapsed. One recent
morning, Khan, 30, and a helpmate searched his arms, hands, feet
and groin before settling on a faint line in his right biceps.
</P>
<P>
   The shot was transporting. His head lowered sideways as if he
were laying it on a platter.
</P>
<P>
   But a few moments later he was up again and grumbling
dissatisfaction. He scavenged in his pocket for another bag of the
brown powder, and this time he inhaled it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am flying now,'' he said, though this was merely the view
from within. Actually, he was staggering toward the street, just
another Karachi dope fiend on open display.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan, which does not lead the world in much, is most likely
No. 1 when it comes to heroin addicts. Reliable country-by-country
numbers have not been compiled, with social science a low priority
in the Third World and addicts hard to poll. But the United Nations
estimates that 1.5 million heroin addicts live in this nation of
150 million, the unfortunate result of geography, geopolitics,
corruption and poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can be quite definite that Pakistan has the largest
heroin population,'' said Bernard Frahi, who heads the U.N. drug
program office for South and West Asia. ``And whatever the total
is, it seems to be getting quite a bit worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Karachi itself, a city notorious for lawlessness, political
killings and gargantuan slums, has 600,000 heroin addicts,
according to the nation's anti-narcotics officials. And while that
total seems exaggerated _ for it would mean that about 1 in 15
adult males is hooked _ the city is replete with the dope-addled in
each section of its troubled sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   Addicts are everywhere and nowhere, easy to overlook from a car
but impossible to miss on foot. They are huddled together on the
sidewalk, under the bridge, behind the truck, against the fence,
along the prime begging space beside the shrine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heroin is written in my fate,'' said Mohammad Aslam, 40, who
had a needle in his arm and a prayer cap on his head. ``No one can
change the decree of fate.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Their days fill with the customary gamut of degradation: the
craving, the begging, the scheming. Aslam has been shunned by his
wife _ or perhaps it is the other way around. He sleeps near the
city's main drainage ditch, just a few feet from raw sewage.
</P>
<P>
   With the veins in their extremities withered, addicts often tug
down their pants, injecting near the groin. Jan Sher, 29, does
this. He is a theatrical man who lives beneath the girders of a
walkway. Dirt is on him like plaster, and there are crescents of
sweat under his arms, but he handles a syringe so deftly that it
may as well be an extra finger.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Karachi,'' he said, letting the needle linger, drawing
blood in, letting it out. ``You can drop your pants in a police
station and shoot up, and no one would care.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A dose of heroin, known as a token, costs about $1 _ about a
tenth of what it would cost in Brooklyn. The quality is bad, with
barbiturates often mixed in. But with the price so cheap, a
three-bag habit is affordable to anyone whose hands can beg small
change or steal an item off a shelf.
</P>
<P>
   A syringe, heroin's most efficient conveyance, sells for 10
cents. Addicts reuse them until the point becomes painfully blunt.
They know the sermons about hepatitis and HIV, but many still share
needles, playing the odds in a kind of microbiological roulette.
</P>
<P>
   The more favored practice, though, is referred to as panni, or
what in America is called chasing the dragon. The heroin is spread
on a strip of tin foil and heated from below. The addicts, who are
overwhelmingly male, inhale the fumes through a straw, sniffing at
the curl of smoke like an excited hound following a scent.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   An entire colony of panni sniffers has settled into the concrete
hollows beneath the Sohrab Bridge, along the main highway. Dogs
roam all over, and while the attraction for them may be in the
ample rubbish, addicts insist that the animals themselves are
hooked.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At the steps around Aurangzeb Park, in the oldest part of the
city, a hundred or so addicts gather each evening. From a distance
they appear to be in prayer, kneeling over candles or matchsticks,
entering a trance in the delicate sadness of nightfall.
</P>
<P>
   Mixed among the bedraggled are a few addicts who have clean
clothes and barbered hair. They work at jobs and go home to
families. And while their normal lives have yet to be entirely
forfeited, they seem without illusions about the eventual
surrender.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more of us everyday,'' Faeez Hussain said a little
boastfully, ``and people from good families, too. You'll find
university graduates among us.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Merchants with stores near the park are exasperated. ``We have
had some of these people beaten, to the point of almost killing,''
said Abid Ahmed. ``But they get up as if nothing had happened.
Beating them is of no use. They will have to die on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The police do not arrest the addicts, though the constables of
Karachi are very much feared by them. They extort cash. Two with
machine guns walked toward an older addict with one eye, Sharif
Uzzaman. He prudently scurried away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most days they rough us up and take our money,'' he said.
``They tell us: if you can afford to pay 50 rupees for heroin, you
can afford to pay 20 more as a bribe.''
</P>
<P>
   Such accusations are not to be doubted. Shabbir, an addict in a
pressed shirt, stepped forward to vouch for their truth. He pulled
his police identification card from his wallet, showing his
constable number. He was due at the station in a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``A policeman is paid only 4,200 rupees a month, and a man with
a family cannot subsist on this,'' he said. ``We have no options
but to take bribes where we can.'' The salary is equivalent to $84
a month.
</P>
<P>
   Drug enforcement is usually left to Pakistan's Anti-Narcotics
Force, which is largely a military operation. Its focus is on major
busts, and its chief, Maj. Gen. Zafar Abbas, cites record seizures:
``Our force is small, but 1999 was a very good year.''
</P>
<P>
   Addicts scoff at those efforts, for heroin is as available as
air. Even the bigger amounts are easily obtained in well-known
spots like the Ilyas Goth shantytown, a tight cluster of wood and
concrete shacks. An extraordinary percentage of the residents _
men, women and sometimes children _ are hooked, entire families
pulled under.

SECOND WHITE FARMER SLAIN IN ZIMBABWE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ There were no military parades, no soccer games
or other public commemorations.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Zimbabwe marked the 20th anniversary of its
independence Tuesday with the death of a second white farmer and
the reported abduction of a third.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades after the Union Jack slid down the mast for the last
time and Robert Mugabe swore to be faithful to the laws of his new
country, Zimbabwe lies in a state of economic and political turmoil
created, observers say, by its beleaguered president. Mugabe
announced last week that his government would forgo national
celebrations and devote funds saved on traditional dances and
fireworks to flood victims in the southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Little in the country felt festive Tuesday, and Mugabe was
clearly preoccupied more with present concerns than historical
milestones. In a pretaped televised address to the nation, the
president called white farmers ``enemies of Zimbabwe'' for blocking
urgent land reform measures and refused to call off violent attacks
against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we reject is the persistence of vestigial attitudes from
the Rhodesian yesteryears _ attitudes of master race, master color,
master owner, and master employer,'' he said, referring to whites
by their former colonial identity. Land reform ``is the last
colonial question heavily qualifying our sovereignty. We are
determined to resolve it once and for all.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe's political crisis started two months ago after voters
rejected Mugabe's attempt to introduce a new constitution. Put to a
national referendum, the draft would have increased presidential
powers and allowed the government to seize white-owned farms
without compensation. The day after its defeat, Mugabe's
supporters, led by veterans of the liberation war and funded by the
government, began invading commercial farms.
</P>
<P>
   The president has repeatedly defended the increasingly violent
attacks, blaming white Zimbabweans and the British government for
obstructing land reform and leading the campaign to kill his draft
constitution. The war against Rhodesia was fought over land, but 20
years later, most of the best agricultural tracts are still owned
by a handful of white farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Government critics say the invasions are merely a political ploy
to shift attention from the crumbling economy ahead of
parliamentary elections that pose the first real challenge to
Mugabe's rule since 1980. While the president pursues a costly war
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Zimbabweans face long
lines at gas stations, rising food prices, and soaring
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   The Movement for Democratic Change, a new opposition party,
enjoys broad-based support among 68 percent of voters, according to
a recent Gallup survey.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe, who returned from Cuba on Sunday, has met over the past
two days with war veterans and commercial farmers. ``We can
understand the frustrations of the war veterans, just as we
appreciate the pressures faced by the commercial farmers,'' he said
Tuesday. ``We should be able to find a way forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the statements, Mugabe has so far refused to call off
the farm invasions.
</P>
<P>
   But the two sides have divergent demands, observers say, and it
is unlikely that Mugabe can close the divide without giving away
his trump card. The farmers want an immediate end to the invasions
and an inclusive approach to land reform. The veterans want land
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no backing down,'' said Gomba Komba, a war veteran
helping to orchestrate the invasions around Harare, the capital.
``We will not go into the elections without a full resolution on
the land question.''
</P>
<P>
   As day broke Tuesday, an angry mob attacked Martin Olds's farm
in Nyamandhlovu, near the southern city of Bulawayo. Olds called a
neighbor shortly after being badly beaten and shot. By the time an
ambulance broke through the crowd and reached his house, the cattle
rancher was dead.
</P>
<P>
   Olds was the second farmer to be killed since the invasions
started in February. On Saturday, David Stevens was hauled off his
land, beaten repeatedly, and fatally shot north of Harare.
Political violence has also claimed the lives of at least two
senior members of the opposition and injured dozens more.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night another farmer, Kevin Tinker, was abducted by a
group of men and held for a few hours before being released,
Reuters quoted a colleague of his as saying. ``He was intensely
interrogated for a couple of hours by the vets and then released
unharmed,'' the colleague said.

 &HT;    It was not sweet, but the market's fall may have been short
 &HT;    By Tom Walker

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The lure of corporate profits and bargain-basement
share prices apparently is bringing the worst stock market sell-off
in more than a decade to an early conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's over is still a matter of debate among analysts.
But given the bizarre nature of this market on the downside,
analysts see no reason to think the upside won't be just as
strange.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Nasdaq composite set its second straight one-day
point gain record on Tuesday, breaking Monday's mark.
</P>
<P>
   The din from last week's volatile sell-off had drowned out the
noise of an upbeat outlook for first-quarter profits, which
strategists had expected would rally the market. Those expectations
have proven out this week instead.
</P>
<P>
   First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks earnings forecasts,
said in its latest report that per share profits of Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 companies should grow ``at least'' 22 percent year over
year, making it the third straight quarter of growth near or better
than 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, scheduled to report earnings today, helped lead
stocks upward Tuesday. Intel and America Online, which reported
after the exchanges closed, also rose.
</P>
<P>
   Share price winners among blue chips included General Electric,
Johnson &AMP; Johnson and J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson-Humphrey senior strategist Robert S. Robbins, declaring
the recent sell-off ``an attractive buying opportunity for
investors,'' gave the market a more bullish rating on Tuesday. He
also recommended that investors trim their cash holdings by 5
percent and replace it with stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a great time for people who have above average
cash reserves _ some people do out there _ to put that to work and
reduce cash to the 5 percent or 10 percent level,'' said Robbins.
</P>
<P>
   Similar advice from Wall Street analysts and public officials
during the weekend was credited for helping to rally the market
after Friday's record sell-off _ and ease widespread fears of
another 1987-style Black Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The crash on Oct. 19, 1987, was the worst in stock market
history. The Dow fell almost 23 percent in a Monday session that
followed a three-day decline of almost 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But that's where the parallels ended, as investors this time
returned especially to quality stocks in both technology and ``old
economy'' sectors of the market.
</P>
<P>
   The buying propelled major stock averages to their second
straight advance: the recently savaged Nasdaq composite by 7.2
percent, the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average by 1.8 percent,
the broader S&AMP;P 500 by 2.9 percent and the small-stock Russell 2000
by 5.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq's two-day gain of 14.8 percent more than wiped out
Friday's 9.7 percent loss that climaxed the worst week in the
Nasdaq market's history.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some analysts are still cautious near-term.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch analyst Phil Rettew told CNBC that a sustainable
rally will probably take ``a minimum of four weeks'' to develop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many more times than not, what you get is a bounce and then
another pullback,'' he said.

 KARACHI, Pakistan: pulled under.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A melancholy addict named Lassi watched her daughter Fatima
snort dope through a ballpoint pen with its ink cartridge removed.
``I did not force her into addiction,'' Lassi said defensively,
pulling at her shawl. ``It was her own decision.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Hashish and opium claim another 2 million addicts in Pakistan,
the government says, and for many users heroin is but the next
step. From there the rungs to come seem to be ones of methodology,
from sniffing to panni to the needle.
</P>
<P>
   However far along, addicts are often unsure how to assess their
sins. There is a metaphysical dispute about what qualifies as
``haram,'' forbidden by the laws of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul Qadir, an addict and a locally infamous car thief, was
wearing a clean white prayer cap. He argued, as many do, that:
``The Holy Prophet, peace be upon him, did not prohibit drugs. He
prohibited intoxicants, and by that he meant only liquor.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a ban on alcohol is commonly cited as a reason for
Pakistan's heroin problem. In 1979, as part of his so-called
Islamization program, the military dictator Mohammad Zia ul-Haq
declared drinking a ``heinous crime,'' punishable by public
flogging. For many, drugs became the substitute for drinks.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, geopolitics turned this part of the world upside
down. A strict Shiite Muslim government took power in Iran, and
many of that country's drug kingpins found Pakistan a welcome
refuge. Then, in December, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan,
and the region became a hot spot for the Cold War. The Americans
and Saudis financed the Afghan resistance through Pakistani
intermediaries, who sometimes found synergy between the heroin and
weapons trades.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 1980s and much of the 1990s Pakistan was a world
leader in the production of opium, from which heroin is derived.
That distinction has since passed to Afghanistan, which last year
grew 75 percent of the global yield. To reach the world market, the
drugs are smuggled out along well-trod roads and donkey trails into
neighboring Pakistan and Iran. Their populations have become
convenient local customers.
</P>
<P>
   Abbas said the opium trade across Pakistan's porous border was
impossible to stop. Besides, he lamented, ``the main problem is a
shortage of drug rehabilitation.''
</P>
<P>
   By any measure that would be an understatement. Karachi has the
capacity to treat only 500 addicts, said Saleem Azam, a highly
respected physician who gave up a prosperous medical practice to
treat drug patients with his own waning funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people in the government are indifferent to drug
rehabilitation,'' he said. ``They say there is no money, but they
always have plenty to spend on the military.''
</P>
<P>
   Frahi of the United Nations has found much of the same lack of
interest among international donors. ``Other countries are willing
to fund law enforcement projects, but we can't raise a penny for
prevention or treatment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most heroin addicts here, like those around the world, profess a
desire to enter a drug program, anything to escape the sheer
everydayness of the despotic routine, the relentless foraging for
money, the guilty uncoupling from their families.
</P>
<P>
   But even if such programs were available, failure rates are high
against so formidable a sickness. The urge to be helped usually
proves subordinate to more immediate cravings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Raees Khan, the man who lives by the mosque, has tried drug
treatment three times, but it involved nothing more than weeklong
stays in a hospital and sedatives to moderate the agony of
withdrawal. On release he was quickly back to a fatalistic apathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I believe this is the way my entire life will be lived,''
he said decisively.
</P>
<P>
   In a moment of reflection, Khan felt a need to visit his mother,
whose modest home is off an alleyway north of the airport. She was
reluctant to let her son through the door. She loves him, she said,
but his addiction is a family disgrace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a young daughter, and soon we will need to find her a
proper husband,'' she explained. ``We will make a much poorer match
because of our shame.''
</P>
<P>
   But finally she softened and allowed him inside. He once had
such potential, she said wistfully, stroking his shoulder. He knew
how to weld. He could do electrical work.
</P>
<P>
   She brought her son a glass of water sweetened with red syrup,
and they began to speak warmly to each other. As he left, he was
able to wheedle the equivalent of $4.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after, he used his nose to empty another bag of heroin,
forgetting his family again and retreating into his medicated self.
</P>
<P>
   He was soon nodding out, his eyeballs rising in his head like
two balloons set adrift.

NEW HOUSING TAKES SHARP DIP IN MARCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The government said Tuesday that new housing
construction fell in March by its sharpest rate in six years, a
signal to some analysts that US economic growth is slowing from its
torrid pace.
</P>
<P>
   Housing starts declined 11.2 percent from February to a
seasonally adjusted 1.6 million, the Commerce Department said. It
was the steepest one-month drop since January 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Housing construction is a bellwether of future economic
activity, economists say, as new homebuyers are likely to purchase
big-ticket items like furniture and appliances.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were divided on whether the report truly showed that
economic growth is moderating. But they agreed that housing
construction, and the broader economy, remain so robust that the
Federal Reserve is certain to raise interest rates in May. It would
be the Fed's fifth rate hike since June.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Ayers, chief economist at FleetBoston Financial Corp.,
said a housing construction slowdown in fact is taking place. He
said the cause was previous Fed interest rate hikes, which had
goosed up mortgage rates by about a percentage point in the past
year. A 30-year fixed mortgage now goes for about 8.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   However, Cynthia Latta, an economist with Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI,
noted that the construction figure had fallen almost entirely
because of a slowdown in new multifamily housing, such as apartment
buildings. Those projects are planned far in advance and require
multiple government approvals, so they are not a good indicator of
recent economic conditions, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The better indicator, she said, is construction starts of
single-family homes, which rose 0.2 percent in March. That figure
suggests that economic growth is not slowing. ``Rising mortgage
rates have not rationed very many people out of the market,'' Latta
said.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, analysts were drawn to Tuesday's housing report
because of what it says about how prosperous people feel.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has long been worried
about the ``wealth effect,'' or the extra consumer spending that
comes when people feel wealthy. When stock prices rise faster than
household income, he told Congress in February, people are prompted
to spend money at dangerous rates.
</P>
<P>
   The danger comes because consumers have ``additional purchasing
power for which no additional goods have been produced,'' Greenspan
said. In other words, demand for goods and services outstrips
supply, which leads to inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The housing market is a good mirror for the strength of the
wealth effect. ``Mainly because of higher stock prices, people are
not only buying washing machines and furniture, but it spills into
housing activity,'' said David Jones, chief economist with Aubrey
G. Lanston, a New York investment firm. ``Stock prices have caused
people to put on a new kitchen, build new rooms, buy second
homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones read the housing report to mean that housing activity is
slowing, though construction is still brisk. ``What that says is
that if you're making monetary policy, there's still a way to go,''
he said. ``The Fed still has to hike rates some more'' so that
economic growth slows to a sustainable rate, rather than crashing
all at once.
</P>
<P>
   Ayers said that the housing sector itself is a cause of the
wealth effect, as the net worth of many families is tied more to
the price of their home than to stocks. When housing activity is
high and home prices rise, homeowners feel wealthy and take out
equity loans or second mortgages to spend that wealth, Ayers said.
</P>
<P>
   In Ayer's view, new housing construction is slowing, which he
sees as a healthy sign for the economy. ``Most people think that
wealth creation is good, and in general it is,'' he said. ``But
when you get rapid wealth creation that fuels spending faster than
short term production gains, that's a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Further evidence of a housing slowdown came Monday, when the
National Association of Home Builders reported that its market
index rose to 62 in April from 61 in March, which had been a
two-year low.
</P>
<P>
   The index is derived from a survey of home builders, who are
asked to rate the pace of home sales and of the traffic of
perspective buyers seeking homes. Jones called it a ``very
important'' index.
</P>
<P>
   Ayers, Latta and Jones all said that Fed policymakers were sure
to raise short-term interest rates by one-quarter of a point at
their May meeting. Ayers and Latta predicted that another
quarter-point hike would come in June, after which the Fed would
hold off on further increases.
</P>
<P>
   Two quarter-point hikes would take the federal funds rate to 6.5
percent -- the highest it has been since early 1991. That was a far
different time than today. Then, the Fed was in the process of
lowering rates to help nudge the economy out of a recession, which
had been compounded by the savings and loan crisis.

   WHERE-THE-HEART-IS-FILM (Undated) _ People don't get much more
alone in the world than Novalee Nation in the early scenes of
``Where the Heart Is.'' She's 17, very pregnant and even barefoot _
since her shoes fell through a huge hole in the car floor somewhere
between Tennessee and Oklahoma. On the drive from her trailer-park
home to a new life in California, she makes the mistake of asking
her boyfriend to stop at a Wal-Mart so she can go to the bathroom.
When she returns to the parking lot, he and the car are gone.
Novalee (Natalie Portman, looking radiant but very un-Queen
Amidala-like) does the only thing she can think of, since she
doesn't know a soul in Sequoyah, Okla. She goes back into the
store, and when it closes for the night (while she's in the ladies'
room) she just stays. Thanks to the camping, patio furniture and
exercise equipment departments and shelves full of magazines and
working alarm clocks, she's quite comfortable for six weeks. After
she goes into labor there she's a local celebrity, and little by
little she builds a life in Sequoyah, with the usual ups and downs,
weddings and funerals, kidnappings and tornados. Directed by Matt
Williams, ``Where the Heart Is,'' opens on Friday. By Anita Gates. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   POPULAR-CULTURE-FILMS (Undated) _ What do we really talk about
with our friends when we're not discussing the vicissitudes of our
personal lives? Why, popular culture, of course! Much of the
conversational glue that binds us together comes from the stuff
that wafts off television, movie and computer screens, from our
stereo speakers and headsets. But go to almost any Hollywood movie,
and you'll find a strange absence on screen of palaver about
recordings, movies, television shows and popular fiction. That's
one reason that when a film comes along that acknowledges the
passions millions of us harbor about favorite works of popular art,
it can strike a deep chord of recognition. Two of the best American
movies released this year _ ``American Psycho'' and ``High
Fidelity'' _ show a bone-deep understanding of how much of our
emotional energy is invested in the consumption of popular culture.
By Stephen Holden. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LISA-KRUEGER-FILMS (Los Angeles) _ The writer and director Lisa
Krueger, 39, has made only two movies, but the longing for
structure is a central theme in both. Indeed, some of the most
touching moments in her 1996 indie debut ``Manny and Lo'' involve
watching how the lives of two underage orphan runaways (Scarlett
Johannsen and Aleska Palladino) are enriched when they kidnap a
discipline-driven woman (Mary Kay Place) and the three become a
makeshift family. As for Joline (Heather Graham), the nightclub
manager heroine of Ms. Krueger's latest film, ``Committed''
(opening Friday), she finds comfort in structure, too. But her
quest _ to save an unraveling marriage by hunting down her wayward
photojournalist husband, Carl (Luke Wilson) _ comes at the expense
of her happiness and, eventually, her own sanity. By Margy
Rochlin. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BIG-KAHUNA-FILM (Undated) _ Last winter, the cast and crew of
``The Big Kahuna'' filmed a feature in the time some people spend
on a beach vacation. Made in Manhattan in just 16 days, stars Kevin
Spacey and Danny DeVito. Adapted by Roger Rueff from his play
``Hospitality Suite,'' the 90-minute film, directed by John
Swanbeck, opens on Friday. It throws three businessmen into one
claustrophobic hotel room and, with a large dose of humor, forces
them to hash out issues of religion, principle and morality. By Ted
Loos. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BOUND-FOR-GLORY-VIDEO (Undated) _ Hal Ashby's 1976 film
biography of the militant singer-composer Woody Guthrie, ``Bound
for Glory,'' misses critics' four-star ranking by a fraction, which
isn't bad for a film with some weaknesses to go along with its
considerable strengths. Ashby, who died at age 59 in 1988 and whose
credits include ``Harold and Maude'' (1971), ``Shampoo'' (1975) and
``Being There'' (1979), had a feeling for quirky characters.
``Bound for Glory'' (MGM, 146 minutes, $24.98, PG) is one of those
old movies that gets a substantial second wind from the clarity of
DVD. By PETER M. NICHOLS. &QL;

<P>
   CHOUINARD-DANCE (New York) _ Offstage, the Montreal-based
choreographer Marie Chouinard could pass for Joni Mitchell's
double, with her sleek 5-foot-8-inch frame, her fragile beauty and
her long, blond hair. Onstage, her persona is fiercer. During her
22-year dance career, Chouinard has been called everything from
``the high priestess of choreographic shock'' and ``a sorceress''
to ``the praying mantis in the hothouse of Quebec dance.'' Many of
her solo dances _ including the first, ``Crystallization'' (1978) _
are being presented by Compagnie Marie Chouinard in a rare
appearance in New York at the Joyce Theater for five performances,
beginning on Wednesday. By William Harris. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VALLEY-OF-IAO-THEATER (New York) _ Lee Nagrin left her childhood
home, Seattle, to come to New York City, where in the early 1950s
she became a noted Off Broadway performance artist and director,
collaborated with Meredith Monk and painted. Her younger brother,
Bert Swezea, stayed behind, becoming a popular real estate agent in
Seattle, where he married and had two sons. Their decidedly
different-seeming paths rejoined in 1992, when Nagrin received news
that Buddy, as she called him, was seriously ill in Maui, Hawaii,
where he had formed a new life of the spirit. Nagrin traveled to
Hawaii to be with her brother, who died the following year. Out of
that experience has come ``The Valley of Iao,'' which opens on
Thursday for a three-week engagement at La MaMa. By Jennifer
Dunning. &QL;

<P>
   ALMEIDA-THEATER (London) _ If we discount the much-hyped London
debut of Kathleen Turner in a stage version of ``The Graduate,''
the Almeida theater has been gobbling up the London critics'
attention in recent weeks. First there was the premiere of Harold
Pinter's ``Celebration'' at the company's grungy headquarters in
Islington. Then it presented Nicholas Wright's new ``Cressida'' in
the West End, with a magnificently dilapidated Sir Michael Gambon
as a trainer of the boy actors who took female roles in
early-17th-century England. And now it has reopened the doors of
the East End film studios once used by Alfred Hitchcock and staged
``Richard II'' with Ralph Fiennes as the king, a production
expected at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in the fall. By Benedict
Nightingale. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SINEAD-CUSACK-THETER (London) _ It would be an easy assumption
to make, but a wrong one, to think of Sinead Cusack as famous by
association. In her native Ireland, the surname evokes associations
to that country's eminent acting clan. Not only was her father,
Cyril, one of the last century's best-known Irish performers, but
having been born into celebrity, Cusack proceeded to marry a man
who became one: Jeremy Irons, the film star. Cusack, however, has
garnered an impressive share of acting renown of her own. Last week
she opened Off Broadway at the Irish Repertory Theater in Sebastian
Barry's ``Our Lady of Sligo,'' reprising a role that won her a
Critics' Circle Award and an Evening Standard prize for best
actress in London in 1998 at the Royal National Theater. By Matt
Wolf. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   YARD-GAL-THEATER (London) _ As is often the case by this point
in the Broadway season, London playwrights are having their say.
This year, three of England's senior dramatists are represented in
plays both new and in revival: Michael Frayn (``Copenhagen''),
Peter Shaffer (``Amadeus'') and Tom Stoppard (``The Real Thing'').
On Wednesday they will be joined Off Broadway by one of Britain's
younger generation when Rebecca Prichard, 28, makes her American
theater debut with her play ``Yard Gal.'' In previews at the MCC
Theater in Chelsea, ``Yard Gal'' is a study over time of two
feisty, quick-witted girl gang members. By Matt Wolf. &QL;

   VARESE-MESSIAEN-MUSIC (Undated) _ On Friday evening Christoph
von Dohnanyi and the Cleveland Orchestra will present Edgard
Varese's ``Ameriques,'' and on Saturday evening Seiji Ozawa and the
Boston Symphony will offer Oliver Messiaen's ``Turangalila
Symphony,'' with the excellent Pierre-Laurent Aimard in the
important part for solo piano. Varese began ``Ameriques'' shortly
after he had settled in New York, in 1915, and Messiaen wrote
``Turangalila'' for Ozawa's orchestra (which was then, in the late
'40s, Serge Koussevitzky's, though the first performance was
conducted by Leonard Bernstein). By Paul Griffiths. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RAUTAVAARA-MUSIC (Helsinki, Finland) _ Matthew
Gurewitschinterviews the Finnish composer, Einojuhani Rautavaara,

   SEXY-SPRING-SONGS (Undated) _ Soundtracks to spring lust are
nothing new, of course. The booty historian could trace the genre
back to medieval maypole dances or, in modernist times,
Stravinsky's ``Rite of Spring.'' The latter not only depicts the
primitive fertility rituals at the root of today's spring singles
but also uses music more dependent on rhythm than melody, with the
fast-driving string ostinatos and emphatic percussive downbeats
that are at the core of Sisqo's ``Thong Song.'' The song, a
celebration of glimpses of scanty female underwear by Sisqo of the
rhythm-and-blues group Dru Hill, was bubbling well under the Top
40. But by last week, with spring love in the air and spring break
on the beach, it was up at No. 5 and still climbing. By Neil
Strauss. &QL;

   ACADEMIE-JULIAN-ART (New York) _ One of this season's more
rewarding sleepers is ``Overcoming All Obstacles: The Women of the
Academie Julian'' at the Dahesh Museum, in Manhattan. Visitors,
though not always numerous, tend to be keenly attentive. The
subject matter makes very good points at every turn but does not
set out either to bully or reproach us. It is in every history of
French painting that in 1868 Rodolphe Julian, a former wrestler,
founded an independent art school in Paris that remains active to
this day. It was the only place in the city at which a woman could
study art intensively in a well-lighted room from a living model
and count on being taught by artists of substantial quality. By
John Russell. &QL;

   BROKERAGE-AD-COLUMN (New York) _ There is a new trend in
advertising for brokerage firms. Reacting to a recent shift in the
investment climate _ not to mention the gut-wrenching plunge in
stocks on Friday _ marketers of financial products and services are
moderating their pitches, playing down irrational exuberance in
favor of counseling balance. ``Financial advertising has gotten
less silly,'' said Marten Hoekstra, executive vice president and
marketing director at PaineWebber in New York. The result has been
to cool down considerably an advertising category that had been
positively giddy in its ebulliently optimistic assertions about how
easy it is to make money by buying stocks and mutual funds. By

   Blind people can't easily tell if a job candidate is white or
black, thin or obese, plain or pretty. So if they should happen to
assess an applicant's professional qualifications, they might well
focus on a more mundane matter: Is she actually suited for the job?
</P>
<P>
   That is, in essence, the question that Herbert M. Greenberg, 70,
who has been blind since he was 10, has been helping managers
answer for the last 39 years. As a result, his human resources
consulting firm, Caliper Management in Princeton, N.J., has grown
into a successful niche player with 195 employees and $14 million
in revenue since he founded it in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a 10-year-old, I thought I'd be stuck off in a school for
the blind, and I'd weave baskets and maybe run a newspaper stand,''
said Greenberg, who grew up in Brooklyn, the son of working-class
Polish immigrants. But his parents refused to comply.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may sound corny, but the oldest son of a Jewish household
is God,'' he said. ``You're the smartest and best-looking, and I
internalized this.''
</P>
<P>
   He certainly needed self-confidence after a mutant strain of the
tuberculosis germ left him blind in 1940. Public schools turned him
away for a year until his parents found one that offered Braille
classes. He had to fight to get into the Boy Scouts. At summer
camp, the other boys beat him up.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenberg was motivated by adversity. ``What drove me was I
wasn't going to be pushed around,'' he said. He graduated from
Bushwick High School with honors and went on to earn a bachelor's
degree in psychology from City College and a Ph.D. from New York
University.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans With Disabilities Act did not exist in those days.
So Greenberg fired off  &UR; 600 &LR;  applications for jobs in college
teaching and social work, listing his accomplishments but not his
blindness. Eighty-five schools ``virtually accepted'' him, he said,
but when he informed them of his disability, he got job interviews
with just three and no job offers. Finally, he was hired by a Texas
college, he says, though he was fired two years later in a policy
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The setbacks, Greenberg said, taught him a valuable management
lesson: ``Don't over-personalize failure. If a school rejects you,
apply to another. If a client rejects you, you go on to the next
one.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to teach at Rutgers, Fairleigh Dickinson and Long
Island universities in the late 1950s and early '60s, selling
insurance on the side. All the while, the humiliation of being
punished for his blindness ate away at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't stand people not having the opportunity to make the
best of what they are,'' Greenberg said, wearing beige slacks and a
blue golf shirt and seated on a deck outside his office, which
overlooks woods and a pond. ``There's so much untapped value in
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Therein lay a money-making opportunity. Realizing how difficult
it was for personnel managers to spot talent, he teamed up with a
friend who ran a market-research company to study the personality
traits of successful salespeople.
</P>
<P>
   For four years, the two men interviewed hundreds of sales
representatives in a host of industries. They then developed a
180-question psychological test that measures characteristics like
risk-taking, empathy and resilience _ traits that aren't always
apparent in job interviews or on resumes. Applicants are asked, for
example, to rate themselves on statements like ``I need immediate
results,'' and ``I work best in situations where I am in control.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone can be experienced or good-looking and have a good
handshake and the tests are blind to that,'' Greenberg said, using
the term deliberately.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg did not invent psychological testing, of course. The
Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, the granddaddy of personality tests,
was created in 1940 and 3 million people take it each year. But
Caliper clients say that while Myers-Briggs gives insights into
general personality traits, Caliper's tests are better suited for
placing people in specific jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg and his partner, David Mayer, started Caliper with a
$15,000 loan. Their first assignment was evaluating hundreds of job
applicants for 30 Buick dealers. Today, with 1.8 million tests
administered, the firm has cultivated a stable of loyal clients,
including corporations like Federal Express and Avis as well as
social-service agencies, the Orlando Magic professional basketball
team and Major League Baseball's Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   John Gabriel, general manager of the Magic, uses Greenberg's
tests to evaluate players. Last July, when the Magic was
considering drafting Corey Maggette, a freshman guard at Duke
University, he was worried that the 19-year-old lacked the maturity
to play pro ball. The test disclosed, however, that Maggette had an
``amazing level of discipline for a young kid,'' Greenberg said.
Reassured, Gabriel added the youngster to his roster.
</P>
<P>
   Does he find it strange that he gets scouting advice from a
blind consultant?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes analyzing a player involves what you can't see, the
intangibles,'' Gabriel said. ``They may be heart, hustle, drive,
determination, leadership. Herb Greenberg can identify those for
you.''
</P>
<P>
   William Carey, chairman of W.P. Carey &AMP; Co., an investment bank
in New York and a client for more than three decades, said the
consultant was also good at identifying ``rainmakers,'' or masters
of doing deals.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Greenberg, who is both president and chief executive
of Caliper and says he has no plans to retire, has his detractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been able to make psychological testing work,''
said Howard Stevens, chief executive of the H.R. Chally Group, a
rival consulting firm in Dayton, Ohio. ``Psychological testing
describes people well, but it doesn't predict their success. I have
a psychological profile similar to Jack Nicklaus. Am I anywhere
near the golfer he is? No.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Greenberg's fans are quick to point out his flaws. ``Mr.
Greenberg is not a very good manager,'' said Irwin Stoolmacher, who
said he had a good relationship with his boss while running
Caliper's day-to-day operations for 10 years before leaving in
1986. ``He's not good with minutiae, not a very cautious person. I
wouldn't want him as my accountant.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg, who has been married three times and has four
children, acknowledges that he is no model manager. He describes
himself as impatient and demanding, with ``more nerve than
brains.'' Some of his investments back up that assessment. He
bought an African-American radio station in Trenton, N.J., in 1976,
even though he knew nothing about broadcasting, he says. After
losing $250,000, he sold it seven years later.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, he bought the Trenton Shooting Stars of the
International Basketball League two years ago. The team, now in its
first season, is losing money, and attendance has been low.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenberg predicts success because he loves basketball, he
says, and ``I understand the sport.''

BOND PRICES BUOYED BY STOCKS AND TREASURY'S DEBT REPURCHASE PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bond prices were mostly higher Tuesday, lifted on one
hand by the Treasury's announced intention to buy back debt this
week yet restrained on the other by the allure of rising stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 30-year bond rose 11/32, to 104 26/32. Its
yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell
to 5.91 percent from 5.93 percent Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department said Tuesday that would buy back up to
$2 billion in national debt Thursday, , the latest in a series of
debt repurchases.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the Treasury wants to buy back 14 outstanding
issues of 30-year securities that will mature between February 2020
and August 2025, with coupon rates ranging from 6.25 percent to
8.75 percent. The spreads in the yield over the current long bond
are 34 to 284 basis points.
</P>
<P>
   The government expects to save money through its buyback
operations because it will save more in interest payments than its
costs to buy the bonds back. In January, the Treasury said it would
like to repurchase up to $30 billion of debt this year. This week
will be the third buyback operation since last month. On March 9,
the Treasury bought back $1 billion in debt, followed one week
later by another $1 billion repurchase. After initially falling
because of a report showing fewer housing starts in March, said
Donald Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Asset Management,
Treasury yields later rose in a ``flight-from-quality.'' The market
responded to both the rise in stock prices and the Treasury's
announcement of the $2 billion buyback, which disappointed
investors who had expected a larger volume of repurchases, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Treasury market has been dominated by supply
considerations lately, Fine said, Federal Reserve policy on
interest rates and overall rates respond to fundamental economic
forces, ``and in this regard housing activity is a key leading
indicator of future economic performance.'' Although the sharp drop
in March housing starts was greater than expected, Fine believes it
was also, in all likelihood, an overstatement of any softness in
housing.
</P>
<P>
   The financial markets anticipate another increase in short-term
rates at the May 16 Federal Open Market Committee meeting, and
recent comments by members of the FOMC, including Alan Greenspan,
the Fed chairman, have done nothing to dispel this view, Fine said.
``Indeed, surging economic growth led by strong consumer spending
and a pickup in the rate of inflation virtually guarantee an
additional 25 basis point pre-emptive move to a less accommodative
monetary policy stance, and while a more aggressive action of 50
basis points cannot be ruled out, it seems less probable in light
of the ongoing gyrations in the stock market.'' &QL;

MIRANDA RULING UNDER SCRUTINY BY HIGH COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Television viewers from ``Dragnet'' to ``NYPD
Blue'' know it as well as lawyers: ``You have the right to remain
silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a
court of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are the opening lines to the so-called Miranda rights,
named for the 1966 Supreme Court ruling requiring police officers
to read suspects their rights.
</P>
<P>
   But the ruling, which has become embedded in popular culture as
deeply as it is rooted in criminal procedure, faces a serious
challenge this week. Wednesday, the Supreme Court will hear
arguments about whether Miranda should be drastically scaled back,
or even eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   And while the high court's opinions are meant to be devoid of
politics, the case comes at a time when there have been serious
questions raised about police misconduct and whether defendants'
rights have been adequately protected.
</P>
<P>
   To conservatives seeking to rid the nation of what they see as
bad law, the Miranda rules are a straitjacket on police, a
too-rigid requirement that puts even confessed criminals back on
the streets _ if their confessions were obtained before their legal
rights were made clear.
</P>
<P>
   To civil rights activists, Miranda is a critical protection for
defendants whose rights have been slowly eroded by the high court
over the past few decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the midst of a criminal procedure
counter-revolution,'' where the rights against self-incrimination
and against unlawful searches and seizures have been chipped away
by the Supreme Court and some lower courts, said Donald E. Wilkes,
Jr., a criminal law professor at the University of Georgia School
of Law.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this has a ripple effect. All of this encourages more
and more bold and aggressive behavior and improper conduct by
police.''
</P>
<P>
   Miranda's critics argue that it's the honorable police officers
whose work is frustrated by a strict reading of the rule. ``The
suggestion that we're going to retreat to rubber hoses and
intimidation (of suspects) is unfair,'' said Todd Gaziano, a senior
fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation who has been helping
to prepare the challenge to Miranda. ``No one wants to allow
coerced confessions.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue before the court is not the Miranda ruling itself, but
a law enacted by Congress in 1968 in an effort to dilute the impact
of Miranda. The law says that courts should consider whether a
suspect's confession was voluntary, and that the question of
whether a suspect was read his Miranda rights should be just one
factor in deciding whether a confession was voluntary and
admissible as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The court's Miranda decision treats the question as clear cut,
with its holding that no confession, however freely given, can be
used in evidence if a suspect was not read his rights.
</P>
<P>
   The 1968 law is still on the books. But so is Miranda, and the
warnings still are required. Prosecutors across the country have
seldom relied upon the 1968 law to support the use of a confession
that violated the Miranda decision and the Clinton Justice
Department has actively defied it.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative scholars, led by Utah attorney Paul Cassell and
former Reagan administration Attorney General Edwin Meese, have
conducted a decades-long campaign to overturn Miranda. They finally
succeeded in bringing the matter before the Supreme Court with
Dickerson vs. US, a case the court will hear Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The case questions whether Charles Thomas Dickerson's confession
to FBI agents that he robbed a bank in Alexandria, Va., was
admissible. Dickerson insists he confessed before he was read his
rights.
</P>
<P>
   While law enforcement groups have added their names in support
of Cassell's argument, those watching the case on both sides of the
issue note that there was never much of a push by the police
rank-and-file to get rid of Miranda.
</P>
<P>
   ``A handful of people decided they didn't like the law,''
complained Nan Aron, president of the liberal Alliance for Justice,
a Washington advocacy group. ``This is just the culmination of a
very strategic, well-organized campaign to overturn one of the
anchors of American law.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department so despises the 1968 law it has refused
its traditional role of defending federal statutes when they face
high court challenge. In an unusual move, the Supreme Court
appointed Cassell to argue on behalf of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In law review articles, Cassell makes it plain that he regards
Miranda as legal anathema, even though he concedes there are
probably very few instances where a criminal is set free because
police forgot to give a Miranda warning. But, he argues in the
Stanford Law Review, the rate at which police solve or clear crimes
fell ``immediately and dramatically'' after the 1966 Miranda
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights activists and some legal scholars see another
trend, a steady dilution of civil liberties at a time when there
are many allegations of misconduct and mistakes by both police and
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, the police department is under fire for a
spate of shootings of unarmed men. In Los Angeles, public
confidence in the police force has been threatened by a massive
police scandal. And in Illinois, executions have been halted amid
revelations that innocent people were condemned to death.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, legal scholars say, defendants have fewer rights, as
the Supreme Court has steadily expanded police powers.
</P>
<P>
   The high court is not expected to throw out Miranda completely,
although it may water down the rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miranda has been a symbol of both our rights and law
enforcement's respect for our rights,'' said Geoffrey Moulton, Jr.,
a professor at Delaware's Widener University School of Law and a
former clerk for Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may have a bigger cultural or societal impact than a
practical impact.''

``AMATODOS'': JOY AND SERIOUSNESS FOR MOZAMBIQUE
</HEADLINE>
 By JACK ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The performance that the National Song and Dance
Company of Mozambique gave on Sunday night at Town Hall was both
high-minded and high-spirited. The event was a benefit to provide
food, shelter and medicine for the flood-devastated nation of
Mozambique, and proceeds went to the Africa Fund, which will turn
them over to the Mozambique Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   All of the dancing was technically precise, and much of it was
joyous in mood.
</P>
<P>
   But grim seriousness was present as well as merriment, for the
entire first half of the evening was devoted to a dance-drama
concerning AIDS, which has taken a horrendous toll in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Choreographed by Perola Jaime, Maria Helena and the company's
artistic director, Augusto Cuvilas, ``Amatodos'' concerned a
sexually promiscuous businessman (played by Justino Zimba) who
contracts and spreads AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The forceful work included erotic entanglements with a multitude
of sexual partners, mysterious sickenings and an episode in which
Liria Rafael, as a witch doctor, unwittingly helped spread
infection by giving all her patients ritual cuts from the same
razor.
</P>
<P>
   But Abacar Mulima and Noe Manjate, two dancers encased in white
sheaths, symbolized condoms and, eventually, most of the dancers
had condoms on their headdresses as they fought off demonlike
figures representing AIDS. The deliberately blunt choreography
preached a powerful message.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Mozambique the Sun Has Risen Up'' filled the second half of
the program. This suite, based on folk styles, was choreographed by
David Abilio, the troupe's general director, and presented the
dancers, singers and percussionists in a festive mood. In dance
after dance, women glided and swayed, while men moved with the
skill and pride of warriors. There were parades, flirtations and
friendly athletic competitions. And the Mozambique flag was proudly
displayed during the finale.

   Executive search companies to maintain tech-firm interests
</P>
<P>
   By Tammy Joyner
</P>
<P>
   c. 200 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Executive search firms aren't putting too much stock
in the stock market's wild ride as they remain undeterred in their
quest for ownership in many of the new high-tech startup companies.
</P>
<P>
   Several big-name headhunter firms such as Heidrick &AMP; Struggles
International and Christian &AMP; Timbers have joined real estate firms
and the legal and accounting professions in demanding shares in
Internet-based companies as part of their fees for finding much
needed top talent.
</P>
<P>
   As the market soared on technology stocks, that trend _ until
recently _ has paid off handsomely for firms like Chicago-based
Heidrick &AMP; Struggles
</P>
<P>
   This year, Heidrick &AMP; Struggles, the world's largest executive
search firm, realized more than $20 million when one startup went
public. Heidrick &AMP; Struggles took a warrant _ the right to buy
shares at a specified price _ in Neoforma, an online Web site for
new and used medical equipment as part of its fee for finding the
company's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   But now that the market for high-tech stocks has been sagging,
H&AMP;S isn't changing its strategy with regard to warrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take our full cash fee in addition to warrants, and
ownership in our clients has value not just when capital markets
are hot,'' said Pat Pittard, Heidrick's Atlanta-based president and
chief executive officer. The company's fee amounts to a third of a
candidate's first-year compensation package.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland-based Christian &AMP; Timbers is a taking a similar
stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not backing off of it at all,'' said Russell Gray,
managing director in Atlanta for Christian &AMP; Timbers.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market drop, in fact, ``may have done a little more to
entice (executives) to join a firm,'' Gray said. ``If a company's
stock is extremely high, (executives) have to increase the value
even further before options take value. If a stock is low, they can
work hard and realize a more significant gain.''
</P>
<P>
   But one equity expert warned that the market's current
volatility serves as a ``wake-up call'' for companies involved in
the practice of taking warrants or options for their services.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of those things people have to be wary of,'' said
Brent Longnecker, an executive compensation expert in Houston who
works for Resources Connection, a Santa Ana, Calif.-based
professional services firm.
</P>
<P>
   While service firms may not be skittish about the market, more
companies will scrutinize more closely the businesses from which
they choose to take warrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a company is banking on the options to pay off and they're
not watching their cash flow, their ability to expand and do
research and development and a lot of other things they would have
been able to do would be impeded,'' Longnecker noted.
</P>
<P>
   Companies ``are rethinking the policies on where they take
options from to make sure that the companies they're doing this
with are sound financially.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the case for Dallas businessman George Michael. His
public relations firm, Michael &AMP; Partners, has taken shares in
several high-tech firms in exchange for his services. Now he views
the practice as a venture capitalist would.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we do something like that, we become venture capitalists
whether we know it or not,'' he said. ``I still believe it's the
right thing to do. But like anything else you're going to have to
look at it closely. People will be a little more cautious. They'll
be looking at the underlying business model.'' For that reason, he
said it may be tougher for some high-tech startups to go public in
the future as potential investors become more critical of the
companies in which they invest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warrants and stock options may not be valued as highly in the
future,'' Michael noted. ``It seemed like you couldn't get hurt
with them (in the past). ... Cash compensation may be a little more
important now.''

NETWORKS LOVE THE TRIED, THE TRUE, THE BLAND
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: For use on or after April 20, 2000) 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chris Albrecht, president of HBO's original programming, had two
potential projects before him: ``The Children,'' based on David
Halberstam's acclaimed account of the civil-rights movement, and
``The Corner,'' an unflinching look at the drug culture focusing on
an open-air drug market in West Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, says David Simon, co-author of ``The Corner,''
Albrecht went with his project, the critically lauded mini-series
airing Sundays through May 21. ``(Albrecht) thought, `Any network
could do ``The Children'' with some justice,''' Simon recounted.
``It's the kind of ennobling story that TV has always been adept
with. But nobody in their right mind except HBO could touch `The
Corner.' Chris was thinking not in terms of programming, but
counter-programming, what (BEGIN ITAL)shouldn't(END ITAL) be on
(network) TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, though, the networks are seeking to get in the
game of sophisticated, specialized entertainment, the kind that
involves and challenges audiences rather than give them something
to do while finishing the laundry or paying bills. Unfortunately,
each time they create cable- caliber shows, they reap cable-caliber
ratings. Which is to say, miniscule by network standards. To wit:
</P>
<P>
   ABC introduced ``Wonderland,'' a dark but compelling drama about
an overloaded big-city mental-health care facility. Midway through
the pilot episode, a pregnant character took a syringe to her
swollen belly during a melee in an emergency room, and although she
recovered, the show never did: Nearly a quarter of the viewing
audience (BEGIN ITAL)immediately(END ITAL) switched channels. (On
HBO, viewers would scarcely have flinched.)
</P>
<P>
   On the next _ and last _ evening ``Wonderland'' aired, it
prompted a whopping 20 million viewers, sated with the narcotizing
effects of ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' and unwilling to
wallow in unpleasant reality, to switch off ABC.
</P>
<P>
   NBC made a valiant effort to sell viewers on its highly praised
series ``Freaks and Geeks,'' about high-school kids in '80s
Michigan waking up to the mysteries and miseries of life; network
executives called the show a personal favorite. But the show had a
couple of things working against it: First, the characters looked
like ordinary people, not Hollywood pin-ups playing teenagers
usually found on network TV.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the characters _ even minor, supporting roles _ were
multifaceted individuals facing a lot of deep, palpable anguish
beyond the ``I'm-not-popular-enough'' boo-hooing of teens over on
The WB. The show in general rewarded close attention more than
casual viewing. (In fact, it was originally conceived as an HBO
series.) It averaged about 7million to 8 million viewers, which
would thrill Fox, The WB or any cable outlet, but embarrassed NBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not the year to try this _ with the game-show mania,
the networks got addicted to huge ratings and it killed their
motivation to do a small show,'' says series creator Paul Feig.
``We had an 8 share, ABC had a 25 share. You do the math.''
</P>
<P>
   Feig's series was frequently pre-empted _ by the World Series,
during the Christmas season, and so on _ and didn't have a chance
to build momentum; it returned once head-to-head against
``Millionaire.'' ``We heard from a lot of people who were attached
to it, and they wrote to tell us they would try to get friends to
watch it, but once they did, we were off the air again,'' Feig says
with a shrug. ``When we were on for four or five weeks straight, we
were always building. We got so much feedback; it was heartening to
know we affected people. I know there are people desperate for this
kind of show _ just not people with Neilsen boxes.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC also took a risk with the quirky animated comedy ``God, the
Devil and Bob,'' about heavenly and hellish forces battling over
the soul of a common shlub. Asked before the series debuted whether
the show might not be more at home on a cable outlet than on NBC,
series creator Matthew Carlson replied, ``From the very start, they
got the show, they got what we were trying to do, and were
supportive.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so a handful of affiliates _ which saw the fact that the
series toyed playfully with spiritual conundrums as a sign of the
impending apocalypse _ yanked it from the air without even taking a
look to see how benign the program actually was; the fact that it
was scheduled opposite ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''
practically ensured its subsequent cancellation within a month of
its premiere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you just don't get lucky,'' offers Carlson, as
philosophically soft-spoken as one of his characters. ``Our fate
was sealed when we were scheduled for 8:30 Tuesdays (opposite
``Millionaire''). The lead time on animation is so long that 18
months ago when we began working on this, Tuesdays didn't look so
bad. But by the time we came on, 'Millionaire' was on the
landscape. It's really tough against a show like that, there is a
relative success, and yet the number's really small and when you
look at it, it hurts. It's hard to get excited about those ratings.
In a time slot like that, it's hard to make an impression.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlson adds that he and NBC were ``blindsided'' by the
affiliate rebellion, less so the protests from people who typically
hadn't seen the show: ``I kept hearing the same (erroneous)
description of God _ 'beer-guzzling hippie.''' He points out that
despite its cancellation in America, the show continues to play
successfully in many foreign territories. ``We're encouraging
people to fly to Spain to watch it,'' he jokes.
</P>
<P>
   None of these delicate series would have been jerked around in
such fashion on cable, where shows are given a time slot for a
predetermined amount of time _ from three months to as long as two
years _ without interruptions, which gives audiences time to find
and form firm opinions on them. And on cable, where there are fewer
original programs on the schedule, a show like ``God, the Devil and
Bob'' would be the high-profile crowned jewel in, say, Comedy
Central's schedule, not just another NBC show to be juggled around
indifferently.
</P>
<P>
   ``God,'' ``Freaks'' and ``Wonderland'' _ together, they sound
like a pretty cool amusement park _ in addition to ``Sports
Night,'' which didn't pull the audiences ABC sought and may next
season go to NBC or HBO, are currently mulling over offers from
other outlets interested in picking them up. (In May, The Museum of
Television and Radio will present the entire run of ``Freaks and
Geeks,'' including six episodes that never aired.) Whether they
will return elsewhere or not, of course, depends on if the
alternative outlets can pony up network-sized money _ which few,
outside of HBO, can afford.
</P>
<P>
   Also worth noting is the fizzle that was ``Falcone,'' CBS's
highly publicized string of episodes about a undercover cop posing
as a mobster. It was, by and large, standard-issue TV fare _
interchangeably attractive performers, simplistic moral quandaries,
rote action, all executed, so to speak, with competence. But
``Falcone'' suffered in comparison to ``The Sopranos,'' HBO's
gangster sensation, to which it was invariably compared. If fans of
the genre had what felt like the real deal in terms of violence,
language and sexuality, this pretender was never going to become a
made man.
</P>
<P>
   Network television will always be able to create a handful of
quality shows and lovable characters, and it's wonderful at working
within the limitations of certain genres (see ``NYPD Blue'' or
``ER'' or ``Everybody Loves Raymond''). But given its increasingly
short attention span, it won't be able to create and coddle
inventive, refreshing shows and situations and characters that
absolutely get under a viewer's skin.
</P>
<P>
   By virtue of their ``volume-volume-volume'' mindset, networks
will always be thinking in terms of appealing to a monolithic
audience, which to their minds, according to their reams of
demographic studies, is not terribly bright. On the other hand,
smart, passionate creators of programs like those above are out to
entertain like-minded individuals _ these folks don't talk down to
their friends, so why should they talk down to their audiences?
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, what separates the networks from cable (except HBO)
is money. Fewer established actors and writers work for cable, or
take big pay cuts to do so. Many of the shows are shot in Vancouver
or someplace where shows are cheaper to produce than in Los
Angeles. Animated series on cable _ think ``South Park'' or ``Dick
and Paula's Celebrity Special'' _ are intentionally cheesy; calling
them ``animated'' is almost being kind.
</P>
<P>
   Feig maintains ``Freaks'' would be hard-pressed retain its level
of quality with a lower budget. ``It would be tough _ we've gotten
rabid interest from cable, but they can't match our budget,'' Feig
says. ``I thought it was a generous budget, but we still went over
every week on show.'' With less money, Feig says, he'd have to
sacrifice some of the period music that peppers each episode or
move production outside the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's aggravating to say that $1 million is not enough,'' he
admits, adding that working with big money can threaten the
material with artistic compromises. ``With those higher budgets
comes higher scrutiny from the money people. If they say something
like, 'We won't pay the money if you don't cast a hot, chesty girl,
because that'll get ratings,' it's hard to say, 'No, you're
wrong.'''
</P>
<P>
   Carlson, too, initially insists that ``God'' is too big for
cable: ``Our budget was about $1 million per episode, and cable
can't do that.'' But, he admits, ``I'm in the broadcasting
business, where you want to seek out large audiences. The way I'm
programmed, you always try to do network first. But, once you fall
in love with your show, you think, 'Wow. I could do almost any
version.'''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   My grandfather was a master builder in Italy. My father trained
under him. I was trained in the Old World sense of how buildings
stand up, how materials interact. From the time I was 5, I was
learning how to read and understand blueprints, how to appreciate
the inherent characteristics of natural materials. Wood and stone
need to breathe, almost like living things.
</P>
<P>
   I help religious institutions restore what's already there; I
don't design anything new. Contractors do the actual physical work,
but I'm on-site to help monitor the quality of work.
</P>
<P>
   I work primarily in New York City at places like the Friends
Meeting House, the Trinity Baptist Church and the Judson Memorial
Church. I did some consulting for the Central Synagogue some years
ago, before it was badly damaged in a fire in 1998. Often I'm in
parts of buildings, like bell towers, where nobody's been for 25
years or more.
</P>
<P>
   In many religious institutions, everything is done by committee.
The people who serve on these boards with the clergy are
volunteers. I have to educate them about budgeting, accounting
strategy and planning. They could be sitting in a building that's
falling down around them and not be able to make a decision. My job
is to get them organized internally and help them get started.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes people call me in for one problem and I find out it's
something else. Generally I insist on looking at the whole
building. If I find a problem with the tower, for instance, and the
stained-glass window needs restoration, too, I might suggest
putting up the scaffolding around the window first so the
parishioners will get excited about the most visible work. It helps
with fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Many of my projects can take 10 years. Some of them are
multimillion-dollar programs. We'll do top-priority projects and
then the religious institution may run out of money. They'll call
back in a couple of years, and we'll do the next step.
</P>
<P>
   I've been working on St. Michael's Episcopal Church since 1991.
They had no idea what the problems were when they called me in.
They needed extensive masonry and roofing replacement, and the
carillon, the set of bells in the tower, had to be reinforced and
rehung. At the First Presbyterian Church of New York, on 12th
Street and Fifth Avenue, we had the entire top of the tower
disassembled and spread out on the front lawn during the
restoration. That work took four years.
</P>
<P>
   The most useful service I provide is a master plan. I tell
church committees, ``Let's look at the next 5, 7 and 10 years _
what you have to do now to avoid further problems.'' I take a
holistic approach. It's like preventive medicine.
</P>
<P>
   When you do this type of work, people become very close because
they have a common goal. On my current project, there's a woman who
brings homemade baked goods to all our planning meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Architecturally, I find religious institutions the most
interesting and the most challenging. But also, they provide social
services. This has a great deal to do with why I focused on them.

MCCAIN TO TAKE FLAG APOLOGY TO SOUTH CAROLINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, former candidate for the Republican
nomination, favorite son of the party's moderate wing, and a man
given to mea culpas, will deliver an especially big apology
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator, making his first return visit to South
Carolina since he gave up his bid for the nomination, will admit
his regret that, during his campaign, he did not speak truthfully
about the controversy over the Confederate flag flying atop the
state capitol in Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   He said then that he viewed the flag flap as a local matter that
a presidential contender should not intrude upon. He also said he
considered the flag a symbol of Southern ``heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   But now that the voting is long over, and his presidential bid
is behind him, McCain will admit that he considers the flag an
offensive symbol that should come down.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said he would make that point emphatically, although the
senator himself declined to preview his remarks. McCain would say
only that he would be delivering an address ``about reform in South
Carolina, and I intend to comment on the flag.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain built the early success of his candidacy out of what he
termed ``Straight Talk.'' At the end of every town hall meeting, he
would promise voters, ``I'll always tell the truth, no matter
what.''
</P>
<P>
   It was lofty claim that invariably drew loud cheers and
applause. Now, McCain's political director John Weaver said, it
will also guarantee that the senator will come in for his fair
share of criticism for his turnabout on the flag issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be some lumps associated with it and
well-deserved,'' Weaver said. ``On one issue only did we violate
the principle (of straight talk), and that was that one.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain will deliver his remarks at a Columbia function sponsored
by the South Carolina Public Policy Foundation, a conservative
organization, Weaver said.
</P>
<P>
   The senator's reversal, which aides privately say is purely a
matter of conscience for McCain, is likely to further cement his
image as a more moderate Republican. It will also probably put
extra pressure on his former rival and the presumptive Republican
nominee, Texas Governor George W. Bush, who may be called upon to
choose between the conservative South Carolinians who swept him to
victory on Feb. 19, and more moderate voters who see the flag as a
symbol of racism and slavery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It places a type of pressure on George W. Bush to do the
same,'' said Bill Moore, professor of political science at the
College of Charleston. ``As soon as John McCain makes that
statement, reporters will turn to Bush and say, `What about you?'
It places the limelight not on John McCain but on George Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the South Carolina primary on Feb. 19, in which Bush
handily defeated McCain, discerning the Senator's true feelings on
the Confederate flag was almost impossible. Most of the time, he
refused to enter the fray, repeatedly voicing his apparent
conviction that the matter was best left to the state to decide.
</P>
<P>
   While that response brought him cheers and applause at his town
hall meetings, pundits and civil rights activists pilloried him and
Bush, who adopted a similar line about the flag.
</P>
<P>
   That effect was compounded when McCain made inconsistent
statements on his view of the flag's significance, calling it on
occasion a ``a symbol of racism and slavery,'' but more commonly
just ``a symbol of heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue was so sensitive with South Carolina voters that the
candidate, normally quick with off-the-cuff responses to sticky
questions, took to reading a statement summarizing his views
whenever asked about the flag. He remained distinctly uncomfortable
when talk on his bus turned to the flag, always eager to shift
subjects at the earliest opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Bush, whose success in South Carolina hung on his
powerful appeal among registered Republicans and conservative
voters generally, also maintained that the issue was for South
Carolinians to decide. He refused to be drawn into discussions of
the flag's symbolism, though he did tell one television interviewer
that he would not fly the flag over the Texas statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore and Senator Bill Bradley, the Democratic
contenders, both denounced the symbolism of the Confederate flag
and the Republicans' failure to take a strong stand on the issue.
Bradley was particularly forceful on this score, criticizing both
Republican candidates ``ignoring a hateful, shameful past in an
effort to bottom-fish for voters'' from the party's right wing.
</P>
<P>
   Since he bowed out of the race on March 9, the senator has
maintained a high public profile, forming a political action
committee to continue pushing his pet issue of campaign finance
reform, and making public appearances with Republican candidates
for office, including New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who is
running for a U.S. Senate seat against Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He has also continued to voice his trademark campaign theme,
that the Republican party should be more inclusive than it has been
of late.
</P>
<P>
   The speech Wednesday comes at a time when the flag issue is
cresting in South Carolina. On April 12, the South Carolina state
senate voted 36-7 to remove the flag from the above the State
House, and to relocate it to an existing monument to Confederate
soldiers nearby. While the NAACP still opposes the relocation, and
approval for the compromise in the House is uncertain, McCain will
make his comments in far more hospitable surroundings than he faced
in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a politician,'' said Ron Walters, professor of political
science at the University of Maryland. ``And what politicians do is
catch up to public opinion, and in this case the public opinion in
the state has forced the legislature to change its mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts speculated on McCain's motives Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``By John McCain coming out, it puts tremendous pressure on Bush
to do so,'' Walters said. The University of Maryland professor said
McCain seemed to be positioning himself for a future run, in case
Bush loses to Vice President Al Gore in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wouldn't want that on his record,'' Walters said. ``He
would want to clean up something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain pushed (Bush) to the right,'' said Robert Lieberman,
professor of political science at Columbia University. If Bush
loses to Gore because he is seen as too close to conservative
Republicans, he said, ``then McCain becomes if not the heir
apparent, then certainly the leading national Republican who is set
up to avoid that problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer would not be drawn into a
discussion of such issues Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is Senator McCain's prerogative to do and say as he
wishes,'' Fleischer said. ``The governor's position is principled
and consistent, and he is pleased now that the people of South
Carolina are deciding what to do with the flag.''
</P>
<P>
   Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster based in Atlanta, said
McCain's reversal would not likely cost him even in South Carolina
were he to consider another run for the nomination in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many things (will happen) between now and then, I doubt if
it'll have a long-term impact,'' he said. ``Particularly since
political events seem to be moving toward a resolution.''

 &HT;    Coca-Cola Enterprises cuts loss, matching analysts' expectations
 &HT;    By Christopher Seward
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Enterprises cut its net loss nearly in half
in the first quarter, but price increases continued to stall the
bottler's ability to increase case sales significantly.
</P>
<P>
   The Coke system's largest bottler reported a loss of $35
million, or 8 cents a share, compared with a loss of $62 million,
or 15 cents a share, in the year-ago period. The results were in
line with expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Cash operating profit, which analysts consider is one of the
best barometers of a bottler's performance, rose 11 percent in the
first quarter. CCE said cash operating profit _ earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and other non-operating items _ rose
to $462 million, compared with $417 million in the year-ago period.
Cash operating results also were in line with Wall Street
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   But price increases dampened case sales in North America and
Europe. Coca-Cola Co., which owns 40 percent of CCE, charged
bottlers more for the concentrate they use to produce soft drinks.
CCE passed on those increased costs to retailers and other
customers who sell its products.
</P>
<P>
   Overall volume, or the amount of products CCE was able to move,
dropped 2 percent during the quarter, with volume in North America
down 3 percent and results flat in Europe. CCE derives nearly
three-quarters of its revenue from North America. The remainder
comes from Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But Martin Romm, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston,
expects CCE's volume to strengthen in the United States and profits
to improve for the remainder of the year. Among other things, he
noted that fallout from last year's recall of Coke products in
parts of Europe is behind the company, that pricing remains strong
and that CCE appears to be getting its costs under control. ``We
think the company will have a very strong year in 2000,'' Romm
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would look for accelerating volume growth in the second
quarter, which will translate into an improved bottom line,'' added
Bill Pecoriello, an analyst with Sanford Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   The company also expects to see an improvement in the months
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   John Alm, president and chief operating officer, noted that
while supermarket volume ``remained soft'' in the first quarter,
results ``will strengthen in the second quarter, enabling us to
achieve our full-year profit objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   Summerfield Johnston Jr., chairman and chief executive officer,
has indicated he is comfortable with analysts' estimates that put
full-year cash operating profit growth at 12 percent this year,
compared with 10 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   CCE said net operating revenue rose slightly to $3.29 billion in
the first quarter, compared with $3.27 billion in the year-ago
period. Analysts think the company's revenue growth has slowed
because acquisitions have slowed.
</P>
<P>
   In heavy trading on Wall Street, CCE's stock closed at $21.93,
up 68 cents, or 3 percent.

TV NOTES: ELIAN'S SAGA? IT'S A MINISERIES; GARNER AS DR. HOPE; THE
STOCK WATCH; TRACKING DINOSAURS

   &UR; ELIAN'S SAGA? IT'S A MINISERIES  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Like every other recent subject that has dominated the all-news
cable channels, the Elian Gonzalez epic has already inspired a
Hollywood producer to sell the notion of a television movie version
to a network.
</P>
<P>
   But Craig Anderson, a producer with no history of
ripped-from-the headlines movie projects, wants it known that he
has no intention of making an exploitation film out of the boy's
story.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Monday, he emphasized that although he had a
deal in place with CBS since January to make what is expected to be
a four-hour miniseries, he had not paid any money to any of the
participants and did not intend to do so. Instead, he said, many of
the principals in the story ``have been pursuing us.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who began as a Broadway producer of plays like ``On
Golden Pond'' and ``Da'' and moved to television with projects like
the Peabody Award-winning version of the August Wilson play ``The
Piano Lesson'' and most recently ``Sally Hemings'' for CBS, said he
intended his film to be a serious examination of both the political
and human issues raised by the conflict over Elian's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make a movie that gets into the legal ramifications,
the political ramifications, the family law ramifications,''
Anderson said. ``I don't want to do a newsreel. That's being played
out every day. I want to do a movie that tells what's really going
on behind the scenes, from the bedroom in Miami to the Oval Office
to Castro's office in Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   How he expects to achieve this is not entirely clear, although
Anderson said he had been in contact with many people involved in
the case. ``We will have access,'' he said, adding that the
potential audience of ``40 or 50 million people means that the
participants will be very sensitive to how they are portrayed.'' He
also said that a script for the film was being worked on and was
``already well down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   The writer is Raphael Lima, whom Anderson described as a former
investigative reporter who immigrated from Cuba as a young boy.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said that while he tended to see valid arguments on all
sides of the battle for the boy's future, he became convinced early
in the coverage that much more was going on than was was being seen
on the surface. ``I would see the sound bites, and I could tell
that people were not telling everything,'' he said, adding, ``I
personally think there is a handshake agreement somewhere that's
being played out.''
</P>
<P>
   What he most wants to avoid, Anderson said, is being drawn into
what he called ``the circus surrounding Elian.'' For that reason,
he said, he does not expect the film to be broadcast until well
after the current furor has died down. That may be sometime in the
next television season, but it depends on how events play out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ending of the story is maybe two months after Elian goes
back to Cuba, if he goes back, after he has returned to
normality,'' Anderson said. But even with all his intentions to
emphasize the background machinations over the boy, Anderson
conceded that ``in the middle of all of it is going to be the
angelic face of that boy. We will always come back to his
situation.''
</P>

<P>
   GARNER AS DR. HOPE
</P>
<P>
   David E. Kelley thought he had successfully resurrected his
oldest drama series, ``Chicago Hope,'' last fall when he introduced
a host of new characters to the drama on CBS. The initial results
were promising. ``Chicago Hope,'' which had averaged 9.9 million
viewers last season, grew to more than 13 million.
</P>
<P>
   Then came ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' That ABC game show
all but obliterated ``Chicago Hope,'' a circumstance that might
upset Kelley more if ``Millionaire'' were not helping his ABC drama
``The Practice'' to ratings highs on Sunday nights. ``That show's
like a big cow,'' Kelley said, ``it gives me milk on one night and
kicks me in the head on another.''
</P>
<P>
   So in what Kelley admits is a last-ditch effort to save
``Chicago Hope,'' he has brought in yet another new character, a
business operator who gets hospitals in fiscal shape, or shuts them
down. The news is the actor playing him: James Garner, one of the
most enduring television stars of the last half-century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a fan of his,'' Kelley said in a telephone
interview. He said that Garner had responded to the character, a
kind of charming killer of an executive.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, Kelley acknowledged, is to try to bring in Garner's
longtime fans, many of whom turned up for his CBS movie ``One
Special Night'' earlier this season. The film, also starring Julie
Andrews, was the highest-rated one of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the cast changes earlier, we tried to make the show
younger,'' Kelley said. ``Now we're trying to go back.''
</P>
<P>
   The results from last week's first of four Garner episodes were
not especially promising: ``Chicago Hope'' fared only slightly
better than it had in recent weeks. This Thursday's episode could
be crucial because the show hopes to be helped by an original
episode of its lead-in ``Diagnosis Murder'' this week.
</P>
<P>
   Of course it still has to go against Regis Philbin. And what if
the ill patient rallies one more time, will Dr. Garner be back to
continue his triage? ``He says he will,'' Kelly said. ``He says
he's having a good time playing this guy.''

   THE STOCK WATCH
</P>
<P>
   The recent turbulence in the business world is to CNBC what the
Persian Gulf war was to CNN: a ratings bonanza.
</P>
<P>
   The business news cable channel has reached record audience
levels thanks to the Dow Jones industrial average's largest point
gain ever, its largest point drop ever and the government's
decision that Microsoft acted as a monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   On eight days within the last four weeks CNBC has reached
audience levels ranking within its top 10 daytime performances. In
all, nine of CNBC's 10 highest-rated days were this year.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, CNBC was watched in an average 564,000 homes between
5 a.m. and 7:30 p.m., according to Nielsen Media Research data.
That represented CNBC's largest daytime viewership ever.
</P>
<P>
   On April 3, the day of the Microsoft decision, CNBC was watched
in an average 486,000 homes between 5 a.m. and 7:30 p.m., according
to Nielsen. That represented CNBC's second largest daytime
viewership ever.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, when the Dow Jones average dropped a record 618
points, CNBC was watched in 466,000 homes in the same time period,
representing its third highest daytime audience in its 10-year
history.
</P>
<P>
   These numbers do not take viewers in offices and public places
into account. If they did, CNBC executives argue, they would be 40
percent to 50 percent higher.
</P>
<P>
   The business channel's surging popularity is also causing some
image problems. Some investors have blamed CNBC for contributing to
last Friday's market drop by interviewing stock analysts with
particularly bearish viewpoints. At other times, CNBC has been
singled out for contributing to investor exuberance. Bill Bolster,
the CNBC president, said that such accusations were unfair. ``We
hold a mirror up to the market,'' he said. ``We present the facts.
People act on that.''

   TRACKING DINOSAURS
</P>

   CNBC isn't the only cable channel that smashed records last
week.

<P>
   On Sunday night the Discovery Channel's three-hour special,
``Walking With Dinosaurs,'' drew the highest audience in the
channel's history.
</P>
<P>
   The special, in which computer animation was used to recreate
the dinosaur era, was watched by 10.7 million people. Discovery
Channel executives said it was the most-watched cable documentary
ever.

REORGANIZATION COSTS COKE $58 MILLION LOSS IN 1ST QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
   By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A day before Coca-Cola holds its annual meeting with
shareholders, which is expected to include protests by black
Coca-Cola employees, the company said Tuesday that it lost $58
million in the first quarter, much of that because of one-time
charges for reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   That translated into a loss of 2 cents a diluted share, compared
with net income of $747 million, or 30 cents a share, in the period
a year earlier. Revenue fell to $4.39 billion from $4.40 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding all the charges, the company said, it would have
earned 32 cents a share. But the company took an 8-cent charge for
the costs of laying off thousands of employees worldwide and a
10-cent charge for reducing concentrate inventories at several
bottlers. Both charges were announced as part of a reorganization
in January.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola also said it would reduce earnings by 16 cents a share
to cover the costs of writing down its bottling plants in India.
That write-down, which sent earnings into negative territory, was
announced at a meeting with analysts and money managers in New York
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Volume rose just 2 percent in the quarter worldwide excluding
Schweppes brands acquired last year, the company said, which
matched analysts' expectations. Including those brands, volume rose
3.5 percent over all. Volume in the United States, the biggest
soft-drink market, was slightly weaker than expected, showing no
growth except when the company's Minute Maid division, which makes
juice and juice drinks, was added in.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, Coke is putting Minute Maid into its
volume numbers for North America, adding a point of growth,'' said
Jennifer Solomon, a beverage analyst for Salomon Smith Barney.
Coke's chairman and chief executive, Douglas N. Daft, has said that
increasing noncarbonated beverages is a central part of the
company's growth strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The lackluster volume in the first quarter increases the need
for Coke to show strong growth for the rest of the year, several
analysts said. ``There is a fingers-crossed mentality that their
marketing plan will be able to deliver stronger levels of volume
growth around the world,'' said Andrew Conway, a beverage analyst
at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``They are going to have to step up
their marketing for the second and third quarters.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the marketing programs in place might not generate high
volume because prices are also rising in some areas, he added.
``You may have to spend more to convince the consumer in
supermarkets and other future-consumption channels to buy the same
amount of cola, given the higher pricing,'' he said, noting that
cola sales for both Coke and its main rival, Pepsico, have been
trailing off in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   In its earnings report, Coke offered more detail about where it
was selling less concentrate, the result of stockpiled inventory
around the world. In Asia, concentrate sales fell 16 percent,
``primarily in Japan,'' the company said.
</P>
<P>
   One analyst noted that Japan was the highest-priced market for
Coke concentrate, and any reduction in sales to Japanese bottlers
has a significant effect on the company. ``As Japan goes, so goes
Coca-Cola,'' said Emanuel Goldman, a beverage analyst for ING
Barings in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The quarter was the eighth consecutive one in which Coke's
earnings declined. The company is under pressure from Wall Street
to improve its performance, and the stock has fallen 19 percent
since Daft was named to the top job in December. Shares of
Coca-Cola fell 81.25 cents Tuesday, to $47.6875.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Coke is also in talks to resolve a
racial-discrimination lawsuit filed last year by four of its black
employees. The number of plaintiffs has since grown to eight, and
lawyers are seeking class-action status for the case, which could
affect as many as 2,000 current and former workers at Coke. The
plaintiffs say they were denied promotions, raises and other
benefits because of their race.
</P>
<P>
   A group of current and former black employees plans to attend
the shareholder meeting in Wilmington, Del., Wednesday to draw
investors' attention to their situation.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola Enterprises, Coke's largest bottler, also reported
earnings Tuesday that reflected weaker volume. Its loss narrowed to
$34 million, or 8 cents a share, from $61 million, or 15 cents a
share, in the period a year earlier. But the bottler reported
higher revenue, $3.29 billion compared with $3.27 billion in the
quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Daft told analysts earlier this month that the company expects
global volume growth of 5 percent to 6 percent this year, and
growth of 7 percent to 8 percent in 2001.

   But in a separate decision, the justices unanimously eased the
burden on convicts trying to introduce evidence on federal appeal
that improprieties at their state trial led to their conviction.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot of the the court's rulings could deprive convicts of
the ability to present before a federal judge the same
constitutional arguments they had unsuccessfully made before state
courts. But the decisions might also enable inmates to bring
federal appeals when they uncover evidence that their
constitutional right to a fair trial had been violated at the state
level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a mixed bag,'' said Larry Yackle, a lawyer with
the American Civil Liberties Union, which defends the
constitutional rights of death-row prisoners. Attorneys will have
to await the fate of future federal appeals to determine whether
the court's rulings are ``prisoner-friendly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The high court's two decisions could affect the appeal strategy
of more than 3,600 inmates on death row nationwide, including 459
in Texas, and the hundreds of thousands of state convicts facing
lesser sentences.
</P>
<P>
   In their pair of rulings, the justices saved two condemned
murderers from the Virginia executioner, at least for now, in
clearing the way for them to challenge the constitutionality of
their state convictions in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The justices said a U.S. appeals court misread a federal law in
denying Terry Williams and Michael Wayne Williams the chance to
have their appeals heard.
</P>
<P>
   That statute, the 1996 Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty
Act, was passed by Congress in an effort to limit the ability of
death-row inmates and other convicts to challenge their state
convictions in federal court. Sponsors of the measure had
criticized the long time it took the condemned to be executed as
they spent years repeatedly appealing their state convictions in
federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Texas joined 34 other states in urging the justices to rule that
the law generally bars federal judges from reversing the
convictions and sentences of state courts.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, in one decision, quoted from the law in ruling 5-4
that federal judges cannot set aside state court convictions unless
the verdicts resulted from gross misinterpretations of prior
Supreme Court decisions governing the conduct of fair trials. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote the opinion, which was joined
by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Anthony M.
Kennedy, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Justice John Paul Stevens led the other justices in saying that
defendants should have broad opportunity to appeal in federal
court. Joining Stevens were Justices Stephen G. Breyer, Ruth Bader
Ginsburg and David H. Souter.
</P>
<P>
   The court, however, was unanimous in its interpretation of a
provision of the law that bars defendants from introducing issues
on appeal based on evidence that they failed to produce at trial.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the court, Kennedy said the provision does not
prevent defendants from making appeals based on evidence that they
tried diligently to find but failed to discover until after the
state courts had ruled against them.
</P>
<P>
   In its decisions, the high court told the Richmond, Va.-based
4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to reconsider its denial of the
two condemned men's appeals with an eye toward interpreting the law
more broadly.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Williams, convicted of striking and killing Harris Stone
with a mattock in 1985 and then taking money from his wallet, can
now pursue in federal court his argument that he was denied a fair
trial because his attorney had failed to tell the sentencing judge
that Williams was borderline mentally retarded and had been abused
as a child.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Wayne Williams, sentenced to death for the 1993 slaying
of Morris Keller Jr. and his wife, Mary, can tell a federal court
that his conviction should be thrown out because a juror failed to
disclose that she had been married to the prosecution's lead
witness for 17 years until a 1979 divorce and that they had four
children.

 &HT;    Onetime charges give Coke second loss in row
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the second straight quarter, Coca-Cola reported a
loss of 2 cents a share after taking one-time charges totaling 24
cents a share, or $680 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company said Tuesday that it lost $58 million in the first
quarter after spending $275 million, or 8 cents a share, on its
massive reorganization that will eliminate 5,200 jobs worldwide. It
also spent $405 million, or $16 cents a share, to write down its
excess bottling capacity in India.
</P>
<P>
   The reported loss compared with a gain of $747 million, or 30
cents a share, in the year-earlier period.
</P>
<P>
   Without those nonrecurring items, the company would have earned
22 cents a share on an ongoing basis, beating the consensus
estimate of analysts by a penny a share.
</P>
<P>
   Beverage analysts pay closer attention to the ongoing results
than to the reported loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``For comparability purposes, you have to go apples to apples,''
said Scott Wilkins, an analyst with Deutsche Bank. ``Therefore, we
strip out the nonrecurring items to get a better picture of the
ongoing operation.''
</P>
<P>
   That picture, hesaid, was not a bad one.
</P>
<P>
   ``On balance, Coke reported some positive elements in these
results,'' Wilkins said. ``Operating profits and margins came in
ahead of our expectations, partly driven by better than expected
results in the key market of Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   Company Chairman Doug Daft echoed that thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the quarter, we started to see momentum in many of our
key markets,'' Daft said in a statement, citing Mexico, Brazil and
Spain, as well as Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford Bernstein analyst Bill Pecoriello credited Daft for
implementing tighter financial controls in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their operating income was up 12 percent, excluding the
nonrecurring items, instead of the 3 percent we were forecasting,''
Pecoriello said. ``It shows that the new management is keeping a
tight control on costs. This means financial discipline and
spending in line with demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola said its earnings also were reduced by another 10
cents a share because of a planned reduction of excess concentrate
inventory by some bottlers.
</P>
<P>
   But Wilkins and other analysts said they do not consider that a
nonrecurring item. ``It's simply lower concentrate sales for the
quarter,'' Wilkins said. Coke sells concentrate or syrup to
bottlers, which add carbonation before filling cans and bottles,
and then distributing the products.
</P>
<P>
   Coke lost $85 million from its equity interest in those bottlers
in the first quarter, while company revenue stayed virtually the
same at $4.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   On the all-important volume front _ the amount of product moved
_ Coke said case sales increased 3.5 percent, including figures
from its recent acquisition of Cadbury Schweppes brands in 161
nations outside the United States. Excluding that acquisition,
volume increased 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkins said the 2 percent growth presented a mixed picture. It
was better than the company's most recent estimate but worse than a
prior forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Latin America saw the biggest increase in volume, 9 percent from
a year ago, including the Cadbury brands. In North America, total
case sales rose 1 percent, while increasing 3 percent in Asia, 1
percent in Europe and Eurasia, and 5 percent in Africa and the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   In last year's fourth quarter, Coke lost 2 cents a share, or $45
million, after taking $813 million in charges to write down
bottling assets in the troubled economies of Russia and the
Baltics.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the company nor analysts could remember the last time
Coke reported two quarterly losses in a row.

ELEVATING THE BROADWAY PIT: LEGENDARY CONDUCTOR SHAPES MUSICALS

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Part of the reason Brian Stokes Mitchell wanted to
play the male lead in ``Kiss Me, Kate'' was that Paul Gemignani
would be in the pit.
</P>
<P>
   John Beal, among the most respected bass players on Broadway,
left ``Phantom of the Opera'' after more than 11 years with the
orchestra to join Gemignani's team for ``Kiss Me, Kate.''
</P>
<P>
   And Gemignani was one of the first people contacted by the
Broadway producer Roger Berlind once he settled on the idea of a
``Kate'' revival. ``He's kind of the dean of the industry,''
Berlind said.
</P>
<P>
   On Broadway, a conductor is often as overlooked as so much
wallpaper, that nameless fellow waving a stick under the stage. But
in addition to wielding the technical skill involved in conducting
the orchestra, musical directors play a major role in shaping a
show, acting as the liaison between the composer and the cast. As
the musical director of almost every Stephen Sondheim work over the
last 30 years as well as such hits as ``Crazy for You,'' Gemignani
has become something of a legend, the last of a breed of conductors
who elevate musical direction to an art form.
</P>
<P>
   Theater veterans say he is one of the major reasons ``Kiss Me,
Kate'' is so musically satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he infuses himself into an orchestra, and drives them
with him and conveys what he's feeling about the music to an
orchestra is, as far as I'm concerned, as deeply passionate as
Lenny's was,'' said Sondheim, referring to Leonard Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Gemignani in the pit during a performance as he moves
through memorable Cole Porter numbers like ``Too Darn Hot,''
``Wunderbar'' and ``Always True to You in My Fashion'' yields only
a hint of his depth and ardor. There is no sheet music in front of
him; he always memorizes the score. Occasionally, at a quiet
musical moment, he closes his eyes. In dance numbers his feet move.
He can make the music sound bittersweet or buoyant with the pinch
of his fingers, the thrust of his fist, the lowering of his palm.
It is a language that the uninitiated can never fully understand or
appreciate. But the musicians who play under Gemignani and the
actors who sing for him seem to have a clear sense of what sets him
apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's in the pit and you're onstage, he is breathing with
you,'' said Marin Mazzie, who stars in ``Kate'' and worked with
Gemignani on Sondheim's ``Passion'' in 1994. ``We feel each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   During her solo, ``So in Love,'' for example, Mazzie said, she
and Gemignani are always communicating _ without ever meeting eyes.
``The passion, the way his body moves, the expressiveness,'' she
said. ``It's in him. It's inspiring.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said that Gemignani allowed him to experiment and to
explore new interpretations. ``If I want to sing the song a
different way, I don't have to tell him,'' Mitchell said. ``If I'm
feeling something different, Paul's going to be there with me
because he's connected to me and he's watching me.''
</P>
<P>
   Some conductors take a break between songs and sit down, leafing
through the newspaper or joking with colleagues. Gemignani remains
on his feet, watching so he can sense where a scene is going and
ensure that the song becomes a natural extension of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to know where the actors are so I can put the song
there,'' Gemignani said. ``I memorize everything on purpose because
I think my face should be on the stage. I consider myself the other
actor in the show.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The musicians in the ``Kate'' pit, several of whom have worked
with Gemignani on and off for 20 years, say they are also grateful
for the freedom he gives them to make the music their own. ``He's
not married to the written notes,'' said Beal, the bassist. ``He
trusts the players that he hires.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Gemignani has high standards, his musicians say, he is
not a taskmaster. ``If you make a mistake, he doesn't take you
outside and rip your head off,'' said Dennis Anderson, who plays
first woodwind for ``Kate.'' ``He never attacks you personally or
admonishes you in front of people. He might look at you funny or
raise his eyebrows.''
</P>
<P>
   A burly man with slicked-back hair and a graying beard,
Gemignani, 60, was married on Valentine's Day to Derin Altay, an
actress. It is his second marriage. He has a 20-year-old son from
his first marriage, Alexander, who wants to be an actor.
</P>
<P>
   Gemignani's air of authority in the pit is balanced by a boyish
twinkle in his eye, a playfulness that seems to inspire loyalty and
affection. ``You have never seen someone do so many different
things with a baton,'' said Suzanne Ornstein, Gemignani's
concertmaster. ``A stiletto, syringe, fishing rod, hand grenade _
it's all very clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Gemignani's rapport with his colleagues is one of the reasons
why the Broadway director Harold Prince made him part of his team
three decades ago. ``He's jovial but firm,'' Prince said. ``It's a
very good personality to have around on a show. You want somebody
that artistic and dependable whose personality is made for such an
intimate collaboration.''
</P>
<P>
   The two met when Gemignani was a drummer and assistant conductor
for the road company of ``Cabaret.'' The son of a concert pianist
(his mother) and school principal (his father), Gemignani grew up
in a Alameda, Calif., trying various instruments: violin, trombone,
clarinet, tuba and finally drums. ``I hated piano and still do,''
he said. ``It's like a one-note samba.''
</P>
<P>
   He came to New York on a whim in 1967, parked his motorcycle in
front of the Blue Note jazz club and went in to ask for a drumming
job, which he got. Prince's musical director, Hal Hastings, soon
hired him for ``Cabaret.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hastings died in 1973 at the beginning of the run of
Sondheim's ``A Little Night Music,'' Gemignani took over as
conductor and Prince made him his resident musical director.
Gemignani said that moment clinched his career. ``It was like a
dream come true,'' he said. ``I was in the right place at the right
time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I happened to hit the most creative years for the both of
them,'' he said of Sondheim and Prince. ``I was working with two
guys who were at the top of their game and everybody wanted to be
me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pacific Overtures,'' ``Into the Woods,'' ``Passion'' _
Gemignani did all the Sondheim shows except ``Company'' (He was on
the road at the time with ``Follies''). He said that ``Sweeney
Todd'' was his favorite. ``It's near perfect in the sense that its
dramatic intent is there,'' he said. ``The score _ I don't think
you'll find another one like it.''
</P>
<P>
   When he and Sondheim parted ways with Prince after the failure
of ``Merrily We Roll Along'' in 1981, Gemignani said he practically
mourned. ``I loved that family, and that family's gone,'' he said,
tears filling his eyes. ``It's like when Mom says, `Get out, make a
living, I can't support you anymore.' It's the hardest thing I've
ever done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I could be outspoken and I could be wrong and I could be
brilliant,'' he continued, reminiscing about those days. ``And
those two guys never made me feel anything but a part of the
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Theater lore has it that the critical failure of ``Merrily''
broke up the team. But though they conceded that the experience was
painful, the collaborators agreed that their separation was simply
a matter of circumstance. Prince went on to direct ``Phantom of the
Opera'' and Gemignani stuck with Sondheim to do ``Sunday in the
Park with George.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened because at some point there was a conflict between
what Steve was doing and what I was doing,'' Prince said. ``Since I
work with different composers it makes sense that Paul would go
where his strongest connection is. I certainly wouldn't expect or
want anything different.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, it looks as if the team will be reunited on ``Wise Guys,''
Sondheim's latest project. The musical stalled on its way to
Broadway this season after a workshop presentation directed by Sam
Mendes, and Prince has taken over. John Weidman, who wrote the
show's book, said that the team hoped to bring the play to Broadway
in the fall of 2001, probably with a new title.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Kate'' is still running, Gemignani said, he will leave the
pit to work on ``Wise Guys.'' ``I've wished this a long time,'' he
said. ``But I can't say I ever thought it would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   That his glory days are past makes the critical success of
``Kate'' particularly sweet, Gemignani said. ``Something like this
should be the norm, not the exception,'' he said. ``This is what
Broadway should be all the time.''

COMMENTARY: A REAL NUT CASE, OR IS THE WORLD BANK A VILLAIN? 
</HEADLINE>
  By PAUL KRUGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Seattle Man went to Washington, his activities were
coordinated in large part by a Web site, www.a16.org. Browsing the
site, I was struck by the critique of the World Bank, written by
Robert Naiman _ the activist who threw a pie in the face of Michel
Camdessus, the former International Monetary Fund chief, a few
months ago. Naiman's favorite _ indeed only _ example of how
bank-imposed policies inflict economic damage is the way the bank
``destroyed Mozambique's cashew nut processing industry, by forcing
Mozambique to remove export tariffs on raw cashew nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Cashew nuts? It turns out that this is one of those stories that
anti-globalists tell over and over, part of the canon that
supposedly proves the righteousness of their cause. Such tales
rarely get fact-checked; nobody asks whether the moral of the story
is really as clear-cut as it seems. So let's look at the truth
behind this particular legend.
</P>
<P>
   Mozambique's cashews are grown overwhelmingly by small farmers.
The great majority of the country's 19 million people live on the
land; at least a quarter of them grow cashews. Until 1995 farmers
were forced to sell those nuts to a state monopoly at artificially
low prices; the state company then processed the nuts, employing
about 10,000 workers. In 1995 the processing plants were
privatized, bought mainly by foreigners, and the state monopoly was
eliminated. But it was replaced by a stiff export tax levied on
raw, but not processed, nuts. This in effect prevented the farmers
from selling their product on the world market, and forced them to
continue selling cheaply to domestic processers.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank demanded, as a condition for new loans, that this
export tax be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for this demand is familiar to anyone who knows
something about the political economy of the Third World. In poor
countries, organized urban workers (and factory owners) typically
have far more political clout than much more numerous but
illiterate and unorganized farmers; the result is an often extreme
policy bias against the countryside. Governments frequently tax the
rural poor to subsidize urban industries _ industries whose workers
are very badly paid by Western standards, but nonetheless receive
much higher wages than most of their compatriots. This case _ in
which peasants were forced to sell their crops cheaply in order to
protect the jobs of 10,000 processing workers _ fits right into the
pattern.
</P>
<P>
   You might try to justify the cashew tax on the grounds that it
promotes industrial development, and will eventually make everyone
better off. (Did someone say ``trickle-down economics''?) But _
again characteristically in such cases _ while processed nuts do
command higher prices than raw nuts, Mozambique's nut-processing
industry requires imported machinery and other inputs, and the tax
on exports discourages raw-nut production. On balance the export
tax almost certainly subtracts from, rather than adds to, the
country's miserably low income.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank is evil, then, because it tried to end a policy
that not only made Mozambique as a whole poorer, but directly hurt
millions of impoverished small farmers. Its high-minded critics
want to keep the prices those farmers receive low, on behalf of
10,000 politically influential workers and a handful of foreign
factory owners. No doubt the faithful will say it ain't so, that
farmers aren't hurt by the export tax because the burden falls on a
mysteriously invisible class of rich middlemen. But why should so
morally dubious a case _ one in which the bank was defending the
interests not of multinational corporations but of starving
peasants _ be a touchstone for the opponents of globalization?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, I believe, is that anti-globalists, though they are
quite sure that international trade hurts poor countries, have an
annoying problem: Most people in those countries want to export
more, not less. So the anti-globalists trumpet one of the few cases
in which a Third World group actually advocates export
restrictions. Somehow nobody notices that this group actually
represents a small, relatively privileged minority, and that its
demands would directly harm a much larger group of even poorer
people.
</P>
<P>
   And thus Seattle Man maintains his comfortable sense of moral
superiority.

 &HT;    Delta declines 11%, but exceeds estimates
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Higher fuel prices and weak midwinter ridership pushed
Delta Air Lines' profit down 11 percent, to $179 million, in the
airline's third fiscal quarter ended March 31.
</P>
<P>
   The profit, which excludes one-time gains, handily beat Wall
Street forecasts. Shares in the Atlanta-based airline gained $1.18
3/4, closing Tuesday at $50.18 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   Delta was hurt less by higher fuel costs than most carriers
because of an aggressive hedging program that locked in
below-market prices in advance. Even so, Delta's average cost per
gallon of fuel rose almost 21 percent to 58.54 cents in the
quarter. Along with other airlines, Delta added a $20 round-trip
surcharge during the quarter to offset the increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fuel is a very serious problem and continues to be a problem
for the industry,'' Chairman and Chief Executive Leo Mullin said on
CNBC. Despite subsiding oil prices, he added, jet fuel costs ``will
not approach even remotely the prices of last year'' in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to fuel costs, Delta also suffered a ``Y2K
hangover'' that hurt January ridership, as did ice storms in
Atlanta that month.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Financial Officer Ed West, during an analysts conference
call, said traffic rebounded sharply in March and that advance
bookings are running ahead of year-earlier levels.
</P>
<P>
   The $179 million quarterly profit translated to $1.33 a share.
That compared with a prior-year profit of $201 million, excluding
special items, or $1.31 a share. Earnings per share rose because
the company had fewer shares outstanding than a year ago, the
result of a buyback. Revenue climbed 13 percent to $3.96 billion.
Costs rose 14.5 percent, with fuel prices and pay raises the
biggest contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Including one-time gains and charges, third-quarter profit was
$223 million, vs. $216 million a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Delta logged a $73 million gain on the sale of more shares in
Internet seat-seller priceline.com. Delta got shares in the dot-com
in return for its early involvement with the site and has realized
a total gain of $784 million through periodic sales. It still has
priceline.com shares and warrants worth about $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   West said bookings at all Internet sites, including Delta's own,
now account for nearly 10 percent of the carrier's business and
could reach 35 percent over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   West also said Delta is testing new, lower fares for business
travelers in some markets to keep them from defecting to discount
carriers that serve nearby cities.

 &HT;    BellSouth service lets firms make e-purchases
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ BellSouth Corp. on Tuesday added to its portfolio for
small-business customers by announcing a service that aims to
smooth the transition to electronic business.
</P>
<P>
   The software, dubbed PurchaseWise, will let an organization's
procurement staff or subordinate officers order supplies, but it
also makes sure the order gets the appropriate approval before
being zipped via the Net to the supplier.
</P>
<P>
   The authorizing executive doesn't need to be directly in touch
with the one doing the ordering, said John Shivanandan, senior
director of e-business for BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This allows him to do it upfront, ahead of time. It eliminates
the need to track him down.''
</P>
<P>
   The software is developed by California-based Commerce One.
BellSouth sees the service as an extension of its expertise in
networking, Shivanandan said. ``And the Internet is a network.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the small-business segment is defined as companies
with fewer than 100 employees and $50 million in revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Although more modest than the multibillion-dollar likes of
Coca-Cola or Delta, the small businesses targeted by BellSouth
together are a substantial economic force. They generate $1.3
trillion in revenue in annually and buy more than $200 billion in
goods and services.
</P>
<P>
   ``BellSouth PurchaseWise demonstrates how BellSouth enables its
customers to take advantage of the benefits of e-commerce,''
Shivanandan said.

UNDER FIRE, BRITISH NUCLEAR ACTS TO EASE SAFETY CONCERNS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN COWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Reeling from a series of debacles over its safety and
management, British Nuclear Fuels PLC the government-owned giant of
Britain's nuclear industry, announced a management shake-out
Tuesday and pledged ``a comprehensive overhaul'' of safety
procedures in an effort to redeem its battered standing in Europe,
the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   But the changes ignored critics' demands for a strategic shift
in the company's businesses after government inspectors criticized
its safety culture, particularly at the sprawling Sellafield plant
in northwestern England, which houses nuclear reprocessing, waste
disposal, fuel production and power production facilities.
</P>
<P>
   This year alone, the company has been forced to postpone plans
for a stock offering and dismissed its chief executive after
workers falsified documents accompanying a fuel shipment to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In another incident, a saboteur severed cables on a robotic arm
in a nuclear waste disposal unit.
</P>
<P>
   Irish and Danish activists have rekindled a campaign to shut
down spent-fuel reprocessing at Sellafield, and in the United
States, where the company has billions of dollars worth of nuclear
clean-up contracts through its Westinghouse division, a top
official said he would send a team of investigators to Sellafield.
</P>
<P>
   With Tuesday's measures, announced in a formal response to
criticism by Britain's Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, the
company said it would replace all six nonexecutive directors and
two executive directors, hire new safety personnel, reshape the
chain of command at Sellafield under a single executive, and
streamline the plant's myriad safety procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is that this is not a one-shot response,'' said
Norman Askew, the newly appointed chief executive, in an interview.
``I know and we all know that this doesn't the resolve the
problem,'' he added, unless the company is ``seen to deliver on
that, and that's absolutely what we have got to do.''
</P>
<P>
   He said there had been no immediate response from some nations
that had suspended commercial ties with the company after last
year's falsification of documents. Japan wants Britain to take back
nuclear fuel shipped with such documents and Germany suspended new
shipments of spent fuel. Bill Richardson, the U.S. energy
secretary, said he would send inspectors to Sellafield, and Askew
said the U.S. team would arrive there soon.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups supported by the Irish and Danish
governments have been pressing British Nuclear to stop nuclear-fuel
reprocessing because of radioactive emissions into the Irish Sea
and into the atmosphere, which the company says it has drastically
reduced.
</P>
<P>
   That would leave the company to focus on nuclear-waste
management and contracts in the United States and elsewhere for
cleaning up contaminated nuclear sites. But company officials said
such plans were not under consideration right now.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``This is not a moment for a knee-jerk reaction on strategy,
particularly as we are aiming to privatize the company in the long
term,'' said Sir Hugh Collum, the British Nuclear chairman, in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Both he and Askew, the chief executive, said the company's order
book for reprocessing spent fuel from reactors ran until 2010. ``It
would be folly for managers to turn their back on that,'' Askew
said. The changes at British Nuclear drew a cautious response from
Britain's watchdog Health and Safety Executive, which supervises
nuclear inspections. Laurence Williams, the chief nuclear
inspector, said, ``If we see any signs of significant failure to
deliver, we will not hesitate to use our extensive enforcement
powers.''

GLOBE SPORTS COLUMNIST TESTIFIES IN LEWIS RETRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH RANALLI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Lawyers for Celtics star Reggie Lewis's widow rested
their medical malpractice case against his former chief
cardiologist for a second time Tuesday after calling a Boston Globe
sports columnist to testify about eerily optimistic statements made
by Dr. Gilbert H. Mudge Jr. on the day Lewis died of a heart
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Columnist Will McDonough confirmed that he spoke with Mudge for
about 10 minutes on July 27, 1993, the day Lewis died. The
telephone conversation took place about an hour and a half before
Lewis collapsed while shooting baskets at Brandeis University and
died, McDonough said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reggie is doing fine,'' Mudge had said, according to
McDonough's column in the Globe the next day. ``He is working out
at his own pace. I speak with him about it. He is doing the things
he usually does at this time of year to get ready for basketball
and I think you will see, within the next two weeks, that he will
accelerate his program. I expect him to begin playing basketball
and doing all the things that players do to get ready for the
season.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonough, in his column, said he mentioned to Mudge that other
players were already ``into their running programs, already
scrimmaging or playing pickup games with other players.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That will come,'' Mudge reportedly replied. ``Reggie is
setting his own pace. When he feels comfortable with his program,
he will continue to do more. I am very happy with this progress,
and I know from talking to him, that he is very pleased with the
way he feels.''
</P>
<P>
   The comments from Mudge, a Brigham and Women's Hospital
cardiologist, appear to portray Lewis as a player whose return to
professional basketball was imminent, not one, as defense lawyer
William J. Dailey Jr. has insisted, whom Mudge had ordered to avoid
``strenuous'' exercise because he might suffer from a potentially
fatal heart condition.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Harris-Lewis's lawsuit charges that Mudge negligently
misdiagnosed her husband with a benign fainting condition that
would not end his basketball career. McDonough was not a witness at
the first trial, which ended in a hung jury last year.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge has previously testified, however, that his optimistic
public statements were part of a strategy devised by hospital and
Celtics officials and the Lewises to keep Mudge's second, more
serious diagnosis from the public.
</P>
<P>
   In cross-examination Tuesday, Dailey tried to suggest that Mudge
withheld information from McDonough to avoid a debate in the media
over Lewis's medical condition and that his comments amounted to
nothing more than a ``polite brush-off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did Dr. Mudge indicate to you that he had given Reggie Lewis
permission to do any running?'' Daily asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' McDonough replied.
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis's lawyer, Neil Rossman, rested the plaintiff's case
after McDonough's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The defense then called its own medical expert, Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center cardiologist Warren J. Manning, as its
first witness.
</P>
<P>
   Manning, in direct contradiction to Harris-Lewis's medical
experts, testified that Mudge actions were ``well within the
accepted standard of care'' because the best evidence from Lewis's
test pointed to neurocardiogenic syncope, a fainting disorder, not
a dangerous heart arrhythmia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything (Mudge) did was perfectly reasonable and
appropriate,'' said Manning, who also testified at the first trial.

 &HT;    BellSouth continues uphill battle to offer long-distance
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When BellSouth started talking seriously about
offering long-distance, it was the largest of seven regional Bells,
Newt Gingrich was Speaker of the House and hardly anyone had heard
of Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Many things have changed, but BellSouth is still talking about
long-distance.
</P>
<P>
   And the way it looks, the company _ which has repeatedly been
forced to backtrack on predictions it would enter the market _ will
not likely have an application for long-distance in Georgia until
June.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's at the earliest,'' said David Burgess, vice chairman of
the Georgia Public Service Commission. ``If they don't meet
specifications, then it gets set back again.''
</P>
<P>
   As one of the seven Bells created in the 1984 breakup of AT&AMP;T,
BellSouth was granted a virtual monopoly in its region but was
banned from offering long-distance. A 1995 Georgia law opened the
door to offer competition in local service against BellSouth.
Passage of the Telecommunications Act a year later was meant to
free all Bells and long-distance companies to compete against each
other.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, that free-for-all was supposed to signal lower
rates and the chance to put all telecommunications services on one
bill.
</P>
<P>
   But that was then, when the Telecom Act was wildly praised by
both Gingrich and President Clinton. And this is now, when the
ranks of telecom have been thinned by a series of giant mergers,
making BellSouth the second-smallest of four Bells. And there is
approval for a Bell to offer long-distance in only one state: Bell
Atlantic in New York.
</P>
<P>
   That approval, however, seems destined to be the only one for
awhile. Controversy almost immediately surfaced over whether Bell
Atlantic's systems were really ready for full-scale competition,
with rivals charging that tens of thousands of orders were lost.
Concern over repeating the problems in New York now hang over a
request from SBC Communications for long-distance approval in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The troubles of Bell Atlantic and SBC are cold comfort to
BellSouth, which had hoped to be the first Bell to offer
long-distance. It has been more than two years since BellSouth
filed its first applications for the right to enter long-distance
in Louisiana and South Carolina. Those petitions were endorsed by
state regulators, then snubbed by the Federal Communications
Commission. Then came Bell Atlantic's problems, which only raised
the bar for BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the FCC approved long-distance entry in New York, it set
the minimum standard for what a Bell company must do to win
entry,'' said WorldCom spokesman Joseph Paluska. ``If it's fourth
down and goal to go for BellSouth, we urge the Georgia (Public
Service) Commission to help all of us get into the end zone by
completing the process thoroughly and quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   To get the Georgia PSC's endorsement, BellSouth must prove that
its systems are ready for competition, that the software and staff
can handle thousands of customers switching back and forth each day
between BellSouth and other providers. BellSouth has spent nearly
$1 billion on those systems, which handle all nine states in its
local service region.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives wearily note that BellSouth has lost about
1.5 million lines to rivals and faces 80 competitors offering local
service in Georgia alone. BellSouth prods regulators: There's
competition in local service, isn't it time to level the playing
field and let us into long-distance?
</P>
<P>
   Not yet.
</P>
<P>
   And while the law doesn't mandate that BellSouth have PSC
approval before asking federal regulators, an end-around is
unlikely. When a Bell shows up asking for long-distance, the FCC's
first question is, What do local regulators think? Unfortunately
for BellSouth, the PSC has been anything but a hometown pushover.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth in 1997 announced that long-distance was around the
corner, since its systems were prepared for local competition. That
claim was consistently challenged before the PSC _ especially by
WorldCom and AT&AMP;T. To be fair, those long-distance carriers do have
an interest in holding back the Bells from entering their primary
market. Still, it is up to regulators to referee and the PSC has
found BellSouth systems wanting.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Jacobs, president of BellSouth Georgia, said the process
has pushed BellSouth to improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PSC has been the best thing that has happened to us. What
we thought would be a fairly straight-forward process when the Act
was passed has become much more complex and defined.''
</P>
<P>
   And as time passed, so did various BellSouth predictions for
long-distance entry. Then, after thousands of pages in testimony
and many months of sometimes rancorous debate, BellSouth and the
PSC last summer agreed to have company systems monitored and tested
by KPMG and Hewlett-Packard. That is the same team that tested Bell
Atlantic in New York.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth predicted an application in the fall. Then, when the
testing faltered, BellSouth vowed to have a proposal to the FCC by
year's end. Y2K came and went, and BellSouth remained on the
outside of long-distance looking in. Early in 2000, BellSouth
predicted that it would file its request in April.
</P>
<P>
   Now April is half gone.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs said he agrees with Burgess that an application will not
come before June. He acknowledged the previous predictions as a
mistake _ but an honest one. The company has often found itself
coping with new and unexpected requirements, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a reality, that in 1996 we thought we'd be in it by
the end of '97. But many of the things that we want the systems to
do today we never contemplated two years ago. And I can't guarantee
you there won't be an another surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth's systems must handle rivals who want to buy parts of
its high-speed networks _ for instance, digital subscriber lines _
that were not part of the process in 1997, Jacobs said. ``I don't
considerate this a failure of performance on our behalf or a lack
of effort.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Burgess also praised the process but said the
responsibility for the many delays must be placed at the doorstep
of BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``They finally believe that the commission will not let them go
forward until they comply with the (Telecom) Act. When it happens,
it will be good for the state and its consumers, but I want it done
right.''

SHE TOOK THE BULLET, BUT NOW SHE CALLS THE SHOTS
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sofia Coppola mumbles. She slouches. She twists and twirls her
hair a lot. She can be painfully shy. She isn't much of a
storyteller and will take the visual over the verbal any day of the
week.
</P>
<P>
   These things become immediately apparent when you spend time
with the 28-year-old daughter of high-powered director Francis Ford
Coppola, a young woman who up until now has been most famous for
being a bad actress.
</P>
<P>
   But Sofia Coppola never wanted to be an actress in the first
place. When her father cast her as Michael Corleone's daughter in
``The Godfather, Part III,'' she gamely went along with the idea,
mostly because she was bored with school at the time. She never had
any illusions, though, about her talent in front of a camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't even supposed to be in the movie,'' Coppola says
softly. ``I was in Rome on Christmas vacation, and they called and
asked me to come to the set. Winona Ryder had dropped out of the
production, and I had already read the part during a round table
reading. My father asked, and I said yes. I just kind of jumped
into it. I never thought about the hugeness of the movie or all the
hoopla surrounding it. When I was there, I was just trying to stay
afloat.''
</P>
<P>
   She hated almost every minute of it. ``The Godfather III'' was a
preordained disappointment (how do you follow the first two
chapters?), and Sofia received much of the blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``The criticism was really intended for me,'' Francis Ford
Coppola says. ``Just like the end of the story, when the little
girl gets the bullet that was meant for her father.''
</P>
<P>
   The little girl is now a grown woman, and after successful
career stints as a photographer and fashion designer, she believes
she has found the job she knew she wanted all along. Coppola has
directed her first film, ``The Virgin Suicides,'' a movie she
adapted herself from Jeffrey Eugenides' novel about five lustrous
sisters who commit suicide and the young boys who can't shake their
memory.
</P>
<P>
   Coppola believes directing was something she always knew she
could do. But, ``When something's really close to you, you don't
see it,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean she wasn't aware of the career possibilities.
There are those famous genes, of course, not that her father
encouraged her one way or the other. (``He wants you to follow your
own path,'' she says.) Coppola made quite a few home videos when
she was young, and took great pleasure in ``getting the other kids
to do what I wanted them to do.'' In fact, what soured her on
acting (besides all the bad reviews) was the inability to boss
people around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not interested in having someone dictate my choices to
me,'' she says. ``I like to be the one doing the dictating.''
</P>
<P>
   She might be the most placid dictator in history. Contrasting
with her famously animated father, Coppola prefers to be seen, not
heard. When directing a scene, she stands right by the camera, in
order, she says, to make the actors feel more relaxed. But it's
probably out of necessity, too; otherwise no one would ever hear
what the soft-spoken Coppola had to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never worked with a director that quiet,'' says actress
Kirsten Dunst, who plays Lux Lisbon, the oldest ``Suicides''
sister. ``Sofia never raised her voice once. She was always so
calm, so collected and so open to other people's ideas. But
underneath that calmness, she was in total control. She always had
an answer and a reason for whatever was happening in the scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Such assurance came from Coppola's total familiarity with the
material. Coppola read ``The Virgin Suicides'' four years ago and
immediately connected with the story, for reasons she's not able
(or willing) to articulate. After learning that someone had already
purchased the film rights to the book, Coppola decided to write a
screenplay anyway, figuring it would be a good exercise if nothing
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt really protective about the book, and I had all these
ideas about how it should be done,'' Coppola says. ``So I'd write
on the weekends, and before I knew it, I was halfway through, and I
thought, 'Well, I should finish it.' When it was done, I had
pictured every shot.''
</P>
<P>
   She had pictured it so well that when producer Julie Costanzo
passed her screenplay along to the company that owned the book,
they ditched their plans and offered Coppola the directing job.
Costanzo says it was the writing, not the family name, that got
Coppola hired, although Francis Ford Coppola did come on board as
one of the film's producers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Dunst, ``The Virgin Suicides'' stars James Woods
and Kathleen Turner, who played Coppola's mother in Francis Ford
Coppola's 1986 film ``Peggy Sue Got Married.'' Woods, playing
against type as a milquetoast father, ultimately became Coppola's
most outspoken and protective supporter, proclaiming, ``I hope this
movie is a success so that all the naysayers who slammed her when
she was a teen-ager because her father cast her in a movie will
finally get to shut up.''
</P>
<P>
   Coppola smiles when told of Woods' comments, but if she's bitter
about anything in her past, she does a good job of hiding it. She
married director Spike Jonze (``Being John Malkovich'') last summer
at her parents' estate in the Napa Valley. (Was it close to that
big wedding scene in ``The Godfather''? Coppola: ``Kind of,
yeah.'')
</P>
<P>
   She talks now of being a ``supportive wife'' for Jonze and
wanting to learn to be a ``homemaker.'' The couple lives in Los
Feliz.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'd really like to learn to do is cook,'' Coppola says.
</P>
<P>
   Might her father have some input in that area?
</P>
<P>
   ``He says he's going to teach me how,'' she says. ``And that's a
pretty good thing because he's almost as good a cook as he is a
director.''!end! &QL;

<P>
   Fanny Kemble wrote a memoir about life in slave-era Georgia
that, when published in her native England, was credited with
convincing Parliament to withdraw loans to the Confederacy, which
in turn weakened the war effort in the clash between the North and
South. On the other hand, in ``Enslavement: The True Story of Fanny
Kemble,'' she spouts such balderdash as ``No one can paint me as I
am because I am not what I appear to be'' and ``I am sick to death
of being Fanny Kemble but I'm so good at it, I can't do anything
else'' _ in the film's first six minutes. So you're not really
inclined to think very well of her, regardless of the historical
record.
</P>
<P>
   And one suspects that Jane Seymour, who stars as Kemble and
serves as executive producer of ``Enslavement,'' really didn't have
anything powerful or persuasive or interesting to say about
slavery, she just wanted to be heroic while parading around in some
really elegant gowns. And so she does, after winning the heart of a
wealthy landowner named Pierce Butler (Keith Carradine), who tells
her, ``I would never attempt to restrict you;'' but of course,
after the requisite love scene, he's doing precisely that not five
minutes later in the film. The rest of the movie is just as subtle.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Sally Hemings: An American Scandal,'' which aired on CBS
two months back, ``Enslavement'' can't decide whether it's a story
about race or just a standard-issue bodice-ripper; unlike
``Hemings,'' it's more at home as the latter. Director James Keach,
Seymour's husband, gives himself the role of a simpering yet heroic
doctor who chases Fanny; he also opens the movie with an
exploitative and otherwise unrelated scene straight out of
``Mandingo'' of semi-nude slaves brutalized for engaging in a
romantic coupling.
</P>
<P>
   He also bathes his wife in so much soft focus the whole movie
feels fuzzy. Though the film spans 20 years and Fanny was in her
50s during the Civil War, Seymour _ whose British accent sounds
like the result of watching an hour or two of ``Masterpiece
Theatre'' _ doesn't seem to age a day. Sitting through this,
however, will most definitely impress upon you the ravages of time.

   Chris Albrecht, president of HBO's original programming, had two
potential projects before him: ``The Children,'' based on David
Halberstam's acclaimed account of the civil-rights movement, and
``The Corner,'' an unflinching look at the drug culture focusing on
an open-air drug market in West Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, says David Simon, co-author of ``The Corner,''
Albrecht went with his project, the critically lauded mini-series
airing Sundays through May 21. ``(Albrecht) thought, `Any network
could do ``The Children'' with some justice,''' Simon recounted.
``It's the kind of ennobling story that TV has always been adept
with. But nobody in their right mind except HBO could touch `The
Corner.' Chris was thinking not in terms of programming, but
counter-programming, what (BEGIN ITAL)shouldn't(END ITAL) be on
(network) TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, though, the networks are seeking to get in the
game of sophisticated, specialized entertainment, the kind that
involves and challenges audiences rather than give them something
to do while finishing the laundry or paying bills. Unfortunately,
each time they create cable- caliber shows, they reap cable-caliber
ratings. Which is to say, miniscule by network standards. To wit:
</P>
<P>
   ABC introduced ``Wonderland,'' a dark but compelling drama about
an overloaded big-city mental-health care facility. Midway through
the pilot episode, a pregnant character took a syringe to her
swollen belly during a melee in an emergency room, and although she
recovered, the show never did: Nearly a quarter of the viewing
audience (BEGIN ITAL)immediately(END ITAL) switched channels. (On
HBO, viewers would scarcely have flinched.)
</P>
<P>
   On the next _ and last _ evening ``Wonderland'' aired, it
prompted a whopping 20 million viewers, sated with the narcotizing
effects of ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' and unwilling to
wallow in unpleasant reality, to switch off ABC.
</P>
<P>
   NBC made a valiant effort to sell viewers on its highly praised
series ``Freaks and Geeks,'' about high-school kids in '80s
Michigan waking up to the mysteries and miseries of life; network
executives called the show a personal favorite. But the show had a
couple of things working against it: First, the characters looked
like ordinary people, not Hollywood pin-ups playing teenagers
usually found on network TV.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the characters _ even minor, supporting roles _ were
multifaceted individuals facing a lot of deep, palpable anguish
beyond the ``I'm-not-popular-enough'' boo-hooing of teens over on
The WB. The show in general rewarded close attention more than
casual viewing. (In fact, it was originally conceived as an HBO
series.) It averaged about 7million to 8 million viewers, which
would thrill Fox, The WB or any cable outlet, but embarrassed NBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not the year to try this _ with the game-show mania,
the networks got addicted to huge ratings and it killed their
motivation to do a small show,'' says series creator Paul Feig.
``We had an 8 share, ABC had a 25 share. You do the math.''
</P>
<P>
   Feig's series was frequently pre-empted _ by the World Series,
during the Christmas season, and so on _ and didn't have a chance
to build momentum; it returned once head-to-head against
``Millionaire.'' ``We heard from a lot of people who were attached
to it, and they wrote to tell us they would try to get friends to
watch it, but once they did, we were off the air again,'' Feig says
with a shrug. ``When we were on for four or five weeks straight, we
were always building. We got so much feedback; it was heartening to
know we affected people. I know there are people desperate for this
kind of show _ just not people with Neilsen boxes.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC also took a risk with the quirky animated comedy ``God, the
Devil and Bob,'' about heavenly and hellish forces battling over
the soul of a common shlub. Asked before the series debuted whether
the show might not be more at home on a cable outlet than on NBC,
series creator Matthew Carlson replied, ``From the very start, they
got the show, they got what we were trying to do, and were
supportive.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so a handful of affiliates _ which saw the fact that the
series toyed playfully with spiritual conundrums as a sign of the
impending apocalypse _ yanked it from the air without even taking a
look to see how benign the program actually was; the fact that it
was scheduled opposite ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''
practically ensured its subsequent cancellation within a month of
its premiere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you just don't get lucky,'' offers Carlson, as
philosophically soft-spoken as one of his characters. ``Our fate
was sealed when we were scheduled for 8:30 Tuesdays (opposite
``Millionaire''). The lead time on animation is so long that 18
months ago when we began working on this, Tuesdays didn't look so
bad. But by the time we came on, 'Millionaire' was on the
landscape. It's really tough against a show like that, there is a
relative success, and yet the number's really small and when you
look at it, it hurts. It's hard to get excited about those ratings.
In a time slot like that, it's hard to make an impression.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlson adds that he and NBC were ``blindsided'' by the
affiliate rebellion, less so the protests from people who typically
hadn't seen the show: ``I kept hearing the same (erroneous)
description of God _ 'beer-guzzling hippie.''' He points out that
despite its cancellation in America, the show continues to play
successfully in many foreign territories. ``We're encouraging
people to fly to Spain to watch it,'' he jokes.
</P>
<P>
   None of these delicate series would have been jerked around in
such fashion on cable, where shows are given a time slot for a
predetermined amount of time _ from three months to as long as two
years _ without interruptions, which gives audiences time to find
and form firm opinions on them. And on cable, where there are fewer
original programs on the schedule, a show like ``God, the Devil and
Bob'' would be the high-profile crowned jewel in, say, Comedy
Central's schedule, not just another NBC show to be juggled around
indifferently.
</P>
<P>
   ``God,'' ``Freaks'' and ``Wonderland'' _ together, they sound
like a pretty cool amusement park _ in addition to ``Sports
Night,'' which didn't pull the audiences ABC sought and may next
season go to NBC or HBO, are currently mulling over offers from
other outlets interested in picking them up. (In May, The Museum of
Television and Radio will present the entire run of ``Freaks and
Geeks,'' including six episodes that never aired.) Whether they
will return elsewhere or not, of course, depends on if the
alternative outlets can pony up network-sized money _ which few,
outside of HBO, can afford.
</P>
<P>
   Also worth noting is the fizzle that was ``Falcone,'' CBS's
highly publicized string of episodes about a undercover cop posing
as a mobster. It was, by and large, standard-issue TV fare _
interchangeably attractive performers, simplistic moral quandaries,
rote action, all executed, so to speak, with competence. But
``Falcone'' suffered in comparison to ``The Sopranos,'' HBO's
gangster sensation, to which it was invariably compared. If fans of
the genre had what felt like the real deal in terms of violence,
language and sexuality, this pretender was never going to become a
made man.
</P>
<P>
   Network television will always be able to create a handful of
quality shows and lovable characters, and it's wonderful at working
within the limitations of certain genres (see ``NYPD Blue'' or
``ER'' or ``Everybody Loves Raymond''). But given its increasingly
short attention span, it won't be able to create and coddle
inventive, refreshing shows and situations and characters that
absolutely get under a viewer's skin.
</P>
<P>
   By virtue of their ``volume-volume-volume'' mindset, networks
will always be thinking in terms of appealing to a monolithic
audience, which to their minds, according to their reams of
demographic studies, is not terribly bright. On the other hand,
smart, passionate creators of programs like those above are out to
entertain like-minded individuals _ these folks don't talk down to
their friends, so why should they talk down to their audiences?
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, what separates the networks from cable (except HBO)
is money. Fewer established actors and writers work for cable, or
take big pay cuts to do so. Many of the shows are shot in Vancouver
or someplace where shows are cheaper to produce than in Los
Angeles. Animated series on cable _ think ``South Park'' or ``Dick
and Paula's Celebrity Special'' _ are intentionally cheesy; calling
them ``animated'' is almost being kind.
</P>
<P>
   Feig maintains ``Freaks'' would be hard-pressed retain its level
of quality with a lower budget. ``It would be tough _ we've gotten
rabid interest from cable, but they can't match our budget,'' Feig
says. ``I thought it was a generous budget, but we still went over
every week on show.'' With less money, Feig says, he'd have to
sacrifice some of the period music that peppers each episode or
move production outside the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's aggravating to say that $1 million is not enough,'' he
admits, adding that working with big money can threaten the
material with artistic compromises. ``With those higher budgets
comes higher scrutiny from the money people. If they say something
like, 'We won't pay the money if you don't cast a hot, chesty girl,
because that'll get ratings,' it's hard to say, 'No, you're
wrong.'''
</P>
<P>
   Carlson, too, initially insists that ``God'' is too big for
cable: ``Our budget was about $1 million per episode, and cable
can't do that.'' But, he admits, ``I'm in the broadcasting
business, where you want to seek out large audiences. The way I'm
programmed, you always try to do network first. But, once you fall
in love with your show, you think, 'Wow. I could do almost any
version.'''

   ``The Miracle Maker'' brings us the Life of Christ in the same
medium that transformed Gumby into a children's icon, Claymation,
mixed intermittently (and irritably) with inferior other styles
(probably farmed out to other animators in order to meet some
deadline or budgetary constraint).
</P>
<P>
   The cast of voices _ led by Ralph Fiennes as Jesus, and
including Julie Christie (playing Mary Magdelene, who's not a
prostitute here, just a little crazy), William Hurt (who, even
though his mug's nowhere in sight, !ital!still!off manages to
overact), Ian Holm, Richard E. Grant and so on _ underscores the
intended level of reverence surrounding this project. And at times,
the tableaux created are visually impressive. Particularly the
crucifixion, but then, every filmmaker tends to do a good job with
the crucifixion; if you can't make that stirring, you don't belong
in the business.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the story is delivered with a reverence
bordering on bloodlessness; kids may enjoy the animation, but
there's nothing that fresh here that parents haven't sat through
countless times before. One imagines the brainstorming session:
``How !ital!hasn't the story of Jesus been told?'' Stay tuned for
next year's sock-puppet version; it really couldn't be any

&HT;     TWO LAWMAKERS SAY JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS PROBING N.Y. MAYOR 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By AUSTIN ZALKIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two Democratic congressmen said Tuesday that the
Justice Department is investigating New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani's release of damaging information about recent shooting
victims killed by city police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Charles Rangel and Jerrold Nadler, both of New York, met
with Justice Department officials earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   They told reporters that in the meeting they had urged Deputy
Attorney General Eric Holder to include Giuliani's and New York
City Police Commissioner Howard Safir's handling of the cases in
the department's current investigation of police behavior in the
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Holder had indicated he would add the mayor and the
police commissioner to the probe, Rangel replied, ``No question
about it.'' The congressman accused Giuliani of ``defaming the
reputation of the innocent victim (an unarmed security guard named
Patrick Dorismond) in order to give some balance to the (fatal)
shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice spokeswoman Kara Peterman declined to say if the
department is investigating Giuliani and Safir. But she said the
existing inquiry ``involves a careful review of all relevant
information.''
</P>
<P>
   The shootings and the Justice Department probe have already
become a major issue between Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton and
Giuliani, her presumed Republican opponent, in their tough race for
a U.S. Senate seat from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Sunny Mindel, a spokeswoman for the mayor, said Tuesday that
``it is not surprising that supporters of Hillary Clinton'' were
bringing such charges. She said, ``Maybe the Democratic National
Committee should investigate this, and that way we can take the
politics out of the Justice Department.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week Giuliani, reacting angrily to reporters' questions
about his views on the first lady's new economic plan, said they
were ``knee jerk, knee jerk, knee jerk'' and that they should
``join the Democratic National Committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month Clinton criticized Giuliani's leadership, accusing
him of refusing ``to reach out, to work with a community that is in
pain'' over the fatal police shooting last year of an unarmed West
African immigrant, Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday the congressmen charged that after his death police
illegally searched Diallo's apartment trying to find evidence that
he was a drug dealer. Diallo was killed by four police officers,
who fired 41 bullets at him in February 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter written to Holder on April 6, the congressmen said
police had no reason to suspect Diallo of narcotics trafficking and
that they ``ransacked the apartment'' hoping to find a way to
``defame'' him.
</P>
<P>
   The four policemen charged in his death were acquitted two
months ago by a jury in Albany, N.Y., where the trial had been
moved.
</P>
<P>
   At their news conference Tuesday, Rangel and Nadler discussed
their April 6 letter citing instances of Giuliani's or Safir's
release of information damaging to victims of police shootings.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers noted that in defending undercover police in the
shooting death of Dorismond in Manhattan, Giuliani released his
sealed juvenile criminal record and his adult record of arrests for
gun possession and assault even though he was not convicted of
either charge.
</P>
<P>
   After police officers killed a man named Gidone Busch last
August, the congressmen recalled, Safir quoted seven civilian
witnesses as saying that the officers had shot Busch as he was
assaulting a fallen police sergeant with a hammer.
</P>
<P>
   Nadler and Rangel said in their letter that ``it is now
universally acknowledged'' by witnesses that Busch was holding a
hammer over his head but wasn't attacking any officer when he was
shot.
</P>
<P>
   Rangel said Tuesday that the release of damaging information
about victims was possibly ``encouraging wrongdoing by policemen
who find themselves in a situation where they've made a terrible
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Nadler said the release of the information has been ``in every
case irrelevant and in many cases violating constitutional
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The congressmen insisted they were not making the charges for
political reasons but said they wanted to improve community
relations with the police.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Serafin, another Giuliani spokeswoman, said that ``voters
will see this (the congressmen's attack on the mayor) for what it
is. The NYPD record of reducing crime is only exceeded by its
record of restraint.''

HOUSING STARTS PLUNGE 11 PERCENT, BUT INTEREST RATES ESCAPE BLAME 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Housing starts plunged 11.2 percent in March, the largest drop
in six years, but the decline was attributed entirely to a slowdown
in construction of apartments and other multifamily housing, while
single-family housing starts were unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department said Tuesday that overall March housing
starts fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.604 million,
down sharply from the February rate of 1.807 million and well below
most analysts' predictions. Single-family housing starts,
considered a less volatile and more meaningful reflection of
whether interest rates are beginning to crimp construction, stayed
about the same, at an annual rate of 1.309 million.
</P>
<P>
   Though the news may have somewhat aided the rebound in the stock
market, which was hammered Friday in part because of fears of
rising consumer prices, industry officials and analysts said the
report that was issued yesterday offered little evidence that
interest-rate increases were significantly hurting home sales. In
fact, some said the housing market appeared surprisingly strong,
considering that the Federal Reserve had raised interest rates five
times since last summer.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the numbers for single-family homes, housing
starts for apartments and other buildings with at least five units
fell 41 percent to an annual rate of 272,000 units during March,
accounting for almost all the decline in the overall numbers.
Similarly, building permits issued in March fell sharply for
apartment buildings but were unchanged for single-family houses,
the Commerce Department said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Carliner, an economist with the National Association of
Home Builders, attributed the decline in apartment starts partly to
an unusually strong February that was helped by warm weather. As
for new single-family houses, he said the interest rate increases
``clearly have not been enough to have a big effect on construction
yet,'' adding that in surveys builders cite labor shortages as a
bigger problem. And although the association's monthly survey of
builders' optimism was 62 in April, down from 77 last June, largely
because of interest rate concerns, Carliner noted that it was still
far above the historical average of about 50.
</P>
<P>
   At Toll Brothers, a builder in Huntingdon Valley, Pa., that
specializes in luxury houses, a backlog has steadily risen even as
the company has raised prices. The number of refundable deposits
placed in March for developments open at least one year rose 5
percent compared with March of last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were hoping by raising prices to slow that backlog down a
little, but so far the market has been pretty able to absorb the
price increases,'' said Fred Cooper, vice president for finance at
Toll Brothers. ``We've been chugging along. We keep our fingers
crossed a little bit with the stock market volatility, but we
really haven't seen any market change.''
</P>
<P>
   Centex Homes, a unit of Centex Corp., a Dallas builder, said
that higher interest rates had hurt sales in the first two months
of the year but that March and April had been strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do expect that continued increases in the fed funds rate
will translate to increased mortgage rates, which will slow down
the housing market during the year,'' said Tim Eller, chief
executive of Centex Homes. But ``for us right now, it's a little
surprising the market is as strong as it is. We're expecting it to
slow, but it's wait and see.''

GEPHARDT'S VOTE ON CHINA A SETBACK TO CLINTON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a setback to White House efforts to win approval
from Congress for permanent normalized trade relations with China,
Democratic leader Dick Gephardt will vote against the measure when
the House takes it up next month.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman planned to announce his opposition to the trade
relations proposal during a speech Wednesday in his hometown of St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The move was unexpected by President Clinton and Republican
leaders who have joined with Clinton in hopes of pushing through
the measure over objections of labor, environmental and human
rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt has long been against any kind of normalized trade
arrangement with China, unless it includes agreements that would
force Beijing to comply with minimal labor, environmental and human
rights standards.
</P>
<P>
   His speech Wednesday is aimed at making that position clear,
although aides said he will also stress that he has no intention of
lobbying other Democrats to vote against the legislation. The
proposal would drop Congress' annual review of China's trade status
and help clear the way for the communist country to enter the World
Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's important is that he's going to let Democrats ... vote
on this up or down on the merits,'' said presidential spokesman
Jake Siewert. ``We think, given a chance to explain the merits of
this deal to the Democratic caucus, that we'll secure enough
support to approve the agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials are confident as the May debate on the
measure approaches that they already have at least 65 Democratic
votes and more than 160 Republican votes lined up, enough to give
them a majority in the House. The Senate is also expected to muster
at least 60 votes in favor of the measure.
</P>
<P>
   But one White House aide said Tuesday that Clinton is concerned
that the House minority leader's opposition could give cover to
Democrats looking for an excuse to oppose the measure, which could
siphon off some votes that Clinton is counting on.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, in his eagerness to win the support of
organized labor in this year's presidential race, has already
provided some cover for undecided Democrats by telling union
leaders that he would support stronger environmental and labor
safeguards in future trade agreements with China.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has expressed his support for passage of the measure this
year. But his comments to union officials were meant to signal that
if the legislation is put off for another year he will move to
strengthen it with provisions more agreeable to U.S. labor and
environmental concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gephardt's opposition to improved trade ties with China
is nothing new, it is more significant in an election year when
Democrats are trying to regain control of the House with the help
of both labor and business interests.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, with Gephardt leading the way, have been fairly
successful this year in drumming up financial support from both.
But some Democrats, led by Rep. Bob Matsui, D-Calif., believe that
voting against permanent trade status with China could end up
hurting some of the party's candidates in the November election.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other major U.S. business
groups are already targeting wavering lawmakers in some five dozen
districts, where the races this fall could be tight. Lawmakers in
many of those districts are feeling the squeeze as well from
organized labor, which is pulling out all stops to kill the China
trade measure.
</P>
<P>
   Matsui heads a group called the New Democratic Coalition that
promotes the idea that the best way to provide more and better U.S.
jobs is to do everything possible to open up the Chinese market to
more American exports.
</P>
<P>
   China has promised more market access to U.S. exports in return
for permanent trade status and entry to the World Trade
Organization. But Gephardt will say today that those agreements do
not include the kind of labor, environmental and human rights
assurances needed to protect American jobs, or the personal and
property investments of American business interests there.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Republican leaders were quick to emphasize the
split among Democrats over the issue. They are calling Gephardt and
others who might side with him ``out of step with the mainstream''
view of most Americans who are in favor of opening up more U.S.
markets abroad. They criticized Gephardt for caving in to organized
labor interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rep. Gephardt's opposition to permanent normal trade relations
for China is a victory for the special interests, but it's a
tremendous loss for the thousands of workers and farmers that
depend on trade with China each year,'' said House Ways and Means
Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas.

U.N. CRACKS DOWN ON NATIONS THAT VIOLATE ANGOLA TRADE SANCTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The Security Council on Tuesday put on notice
any country or leader breaking international sanctions by trading
with a rebel movement in Angola that has sustained itself by
selling diamonds and smuggling weapons and oil.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly tighter trade sanctions have been imposed on the
Angolan rebel leader, Jonas Savimbi, and his UNITA movement since
1993, a year after he refused to accept losing an election. But the
sanctions have been consistently violated by Savimbi and a circle
of compliant nations or individuals, including diamond traders in
Belgium, the international center of the diamond trade.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Angola civil war, now in its third decade, has
killed a million people and driven 3 million more from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   In the next six months, international monitors will collect
information on sanctions violators, building on a tough report last
month from an unusual investigative panel set up by a Security
Council sanctions committee. In November, when the results of the
monitoring and other evidence is assembled, those who are found to
have violated international embargoes could be subject to sanctions
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The report from the Angola sanctions committee's investigative
panel, set up by the Canadian ambassador, Robert Fowler, named not
only diamond merchants in Belgium, but also arms brokers in South
Africa, weapons suppliers in Bulgaria and African leaders who let
their countries be used as deal-making centers, transshipment
points or refuges, in exchange for diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   The specificity of the accusations, a break with the usual
masking of reported culprits in United Nations documents, raised
outrage in Africa, particularly French-speaking Africa, and in
Europe. On Tuesday, France's representative, Jean-David Levitte,
said new sanctions against nations that have supposedly violated
the standing sanctions ``does not in this connection appear to us
to provide a real solution.''
</P>
<P>
   But a measure of the success of the ploy, diplomats said
Tuesday, was the extent to which countries suddenly in the
spotlight had scrambled to reply to accusations and, in some cases,
to curtail illegal trading.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of Belgium, Bulgaria and Burkina Faso _ whose
president, Blaise Compaore, was one of two named in the sanctions
committee's report, along with President Gnassingbe Eydadema of
Togo _ all defended their countries in the Security Council debate
that preceded the vote on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   They rebutted some accusations. But all three representatives,
and others who spoke, lauded the committee's effort and pledged to
cooperate in further investigations. Some reported establishing
panels to enforce the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The council resolution on Tuesday was also proposed by Canada,
which holds the council presidency this month, and was extensively
debated before members finally approved it, 15-0. Diplomats expect
the debate to reopen in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Canada, which has been a leader in trying to strengthen council
resolutions generally, announced that it would put financial
support behind the efforts to enforce sanctions against UNITA.
Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy, who has been presiding over
council sessions this week, said his country would provide $100,000
to help pay for monitoring and would give technical and financial
assistance to the countries of the Southern African Development
Community to support their efforts to police the embargo. The
resolution leans heavily on those nations to be more vigilant and
take action.
</P>
<P>
   Axworthy also said Canada would sponsor a conference to study
pinpointing more accurately the source of rough diamonds and their
paths to market.
</P>
<P>
   In speaking to the council about Canada's intent in pressing for
efficient sanctions in Angola, Axworthy said that ``if successful,
these measures could serve as a template for focused action against
belligerents in other conflict situations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The panel's efforts have highlighted the reality and the
impact of new war economies _ the nexus between parties to armed
violence, the exploitation of people and resources and the
commercial interests that profit from it,'' he said. ``In a growing
number of conflict situations, economic agendas coexist with
political and military goals in the perpetuation of violence and
the victimization of people.''

AN AMERICAN COHEN MEETS HIS BANTU KINSMAN

   (Jon Cohen writes for Science and Talk)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BY JON COHEN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When a 1998 study in Nature announced that people named Cohen
share a strikingly similar genetic makeup, I shrugged. As a Cohen,
I had assumed that I was related to all other Cohens. After all,
the name wasn't forced on my family by a plantation owner nor is it
an Ellis Island abbreviation of Kuznyetshovsky.
</P>
<P>
   What did surprise me were the findings revealed a year later by
the same researchers: Most members of the Buba clan of the Lemba
tribe, a 70,000-strong Bantu-speaking people dispersed throughout
southern Africa, are related to us Cohens. Spicing up my personal
connection, the Lemba claim to have migrated from Yemen, the home
of my father's parents.
</P>
<P>
   The Cohen link wasn't exactly news to the Lemba. Despite the
dismissiveness of academics and some South African Jews, the Lemba
have long claimed that they are black Jews, a lost tribe who 3,000
years ago sailed across the Arabian Sea from their home in Yemen to
the African continent, slowly migrating down to what is now
Zimbabwe and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, they follow some Jewish-like traditions -- male
circumcision, religious use of a six-pointed star (with an elephant
inside it), ritual slaughter of animals, dietary rules that
discourage the eating of pork, and marriage within the tribe.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many Lemba also have that one decidedly non-Jewish belief:
that Jesus Christ is the Lord.
</P>
<P>
   Because I was already headed to Africa on business, I decided to
invite myself over to the Lemba's for shabbat dinner, or something
equally cozy, and talk about our mutual ancestors. But first I
wanted to know how closely I was related to the Buba clan, so I
asked David Goldstein, a geneticist at University College London
who led these studies, to analyze my DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Geneticists can determine whether males share common male
ancestors because an identical copy of the Y chromosome passes from
father to son. In their first Cohen study, Goldstein and his
co-workers discovered a unique signature in the DNA of 100 Cohen
males they studied -- specific mutations on the Y chromosome --
which they dubbed the ``Cohen modal haplotype.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on expected mutation rates, the researchers dated the
Cohen modal haplotype back as far as 3,250 years ago (130
generations), approximately the time when Aaron, the brother of
Moses, supposedly anointed the Cohen clan as the high priests of
the religion. This connection had special resonance for me: My
father for most of his career worked as a cantor, the musical
counterpart to a rabbi. Goldstein sent me a sterile Q-Tip in a
liquid-filled test tube to collect a DNA sample. I swabbed the
inside of my cheek with it and mailed it back. From this sample,
Goldstein extracted my Y chromosome's DNA and commenced his hunt
for the Cohen modal haplotype markers. Whereas 56 percent of Lembas
from the Buba clan have 17 of the 17 markers that constitute the
Cohen modal haplotype, Goldstein found that I have only 16, making
me a ``one-step neighbor.''
</P>
<P>
   Confused, I asked if being a one-step neighbor meant that one of
my forefathers had a mutation in his Y, branching him off the tree
that represented the Buba clan of the Lemba and other ``true''
Cohens in his study? ``It can't be said exactly that way,''
Goldstein cautioned, sounding like a rebbe answering a question of
Talmudic proportions. ``The way that I'd say it that would be
accurate won't be very satisfying for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein -- who has the Cohen modal haplotype himself -- added,
``We don't know that there ever was a pure Jewish population.'' He
urged me to think of my Y chromosome in terms of genealogy, not
populations. The essence of his caveat is that all men derive from
a common ancestor (say, Adam), and the Cohen modal haplotype simply
designates a more recent common ancestor (say, Aaron Cohen).
</P>
<P>
   While I suspect my conclusion won't be very satisfying for
Goldstein, I think that, in all likelihood, I'm a mutant Cohen. I
was, however, placated to learn how my Y chromosomes compare with
other men in Goldstein's ever-growing database: My markers
perfectly match those of three Yemenite Jews from Hadhramout -- the
very region where the Lemba supposedly once lived.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Jones, another University College London geneticist,
argues against the Lemba being a lost tribe ``with uninterrupted
genetic contact with the Middle East.'' The Cohen modal haplotype
might well have bounced down the African continent over the
generations and been eventually absorbed by the Lemba.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein says some non-Cohen Jews have taken umbrage at this
work, as they (wrongly) inferred that the data say Cohens are
genetically superior to other Jews. ``Be careful how you write
this,'' he added. ``This cannot be taken as a view of status. Have
sensitivities. People get really worked up about these things.''
</P>
<P>
   To arrange a reconvening of our tribes, I phoned Prof. M.E.R.
Mathiva, whom one anthropologist dubbed ``the spiritual head of the
South African Lemba.'' A trip to Mathiva's home in Thohayandou,
South Africa, would require a plane flight from Johannesburg, a
rental car, and drive through towns called Nobody and Nirvana. I
was ready.
</P>
<P>
   But Mathiva declined my self-invitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lemba don't need attention anymore,'' said Mathiva, adding
that three Yemenite Cohens had visited the previous Friday on a
similar mission. Instead, he referred me to a Buba Lemba in
Johannesburg, and after a few more phone calls, I had secured an
invitation from Peter Mbelangwa to visit him at home.
</P>
<P>
   Mbelangwa, who works as a manager at IBM, welcomed me warmly, if
a bit cautiously, to his home in Bramley Gardens, a tony suburb of
Johannesburg. He introduced me to his wife and three sons, and we
sat in his living room, which was free of the religious artifacts
of most American Jewish homes -- photos of brides and grooms
standing under chuppahs, needlepoints of yarmulke-clad men snapping
their fingers in dance, artsy menorahs, and gilded sedar plates.
</P>
<P>
   Probing the Jewish-like ``dos and don'ts'' of the Lemba, I found
as many differences as similarities. Mbelangwa had never heard of
the kosher practice of separating milk from meat. Lemba don't
celebrate Passover, which is as important a religious gathering to
most Jews as Easter is to Christians. He didn't know whether it was
forbidden to name a child after a living relative, which Jews
aren't supposed to do.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking that some less obvious ancient bonds might exist, I
sang a whiny, distinctive Yemenite song. Mbelangwa then sang a
Lemba funeral dirge, which couldn't have been more different. He
also played a Lemba instrument for me, a sambira, a gourd that has
thin metal reeds sprouting out of it like the fingers of a rake.
When he plucked it, it didn't sound Yemenite to my ear.
</P>
<P>
   Mbelangwa's wife also donned a Lemba dress for me, and some
Lemba jewelry. They were beautiful but did not rock my vestigial
soul. I asked Mbelangwa's sons whether I looked like any of their
relatives. The boys politely shook their heads no, and I could tell
from the slight smiles they thought me a fool.
</P>
<P>
   Mbelangwa and I then discussed his views of South African Jews.
``There are Jews who benefited from apartheid,'' he said. ``And
there are those Jews who opened the doors for us during the days of
oppression.'' Yes, some of his good friends were South African
Jews, but he confided that ``you don't close your eyes in front of
a Jew.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't exactly the call to brotherhood that I had traveled
7,000 miles to hear, least of all from a Cohen. I understand about
having misgivings about your own: I purposefully keep my distance
from a few relatives who are only a twig away on the family tree.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as my whole Cohen modal haplotype quest began to collapse
under its own weight, I had to accept the fact that my DNA wasn't
going to shake hands with Mbelangwa's over the millenniums. The
romance of kinship can mislead, whether it is with a first cousin
or, as in the case of Peter Mbelangwa, someone who is an
unfathomably distant cousin, 130 generations removed.

DUST FLIES AS ANTIQUARIAN BOOKSELLERS REACT TO ONLINE OPERATIONS  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore. Wis., Nev., Calif., Spain, Canada)   By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For decades, the antiquarian trade has remained the dusty,
genteel corner of the book market, attracting fiercely independent
booksellers who savor the musty fragrance of brown-spotted rag
paper and the Eureka moment of spotting a rare first edition dumped
in a garage sale heap.
</P>
<P>
   But now the dust motes are flying in the rare and used book
market with the flashy emergence of Alibris, an online used
bookseller that has Wall Street ambitions, Silicon Valley money,
and a strategy that is roiling one of the last bastions of the book
market where small dealers still hold sway. With financial
resources totaling more than $60 million in venture capital,
Alibris is a mix of Internet start-up and industry upstart, a
two-year-old company with a cheeky national advertising campaign
aimed at building a mighty brand on the spines of old books.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business has never had this public persona,'' said Susan
Siegel, who with her husband annually publishes ``The Used Book
Lover's Guides,'' a series of seven regional handbooks. ``It's just
been these little stores that book-aholics and collectors and
academics know about. The Internet has changed that, and
Alibris.com is dealing with customers in a more sophisticated
marketing way that was never needed before.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the battering that Internet companies suffered on the
stock market last week, some analysts question whether Alibris'
plans to lavish as much as $100 million on advertising will be
money well spent.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester Research, an Internet research firm, recently issued a
report predicting that increasing competitive pressures will drive
many e-commerce companies out of business by next year. They advise
companies to redirect resources from expensive ``branding
campaign'' into hard assets, service and speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen their ads and they're very cute,'' said Carrie
Johnson, a Forrester analyst for on-line retail commerce. ``But so
are all these other pure plays that have burned through $50 million
in advertising, and we're watching these disappear. Unfortunately,
there's not a lot of room for new brands.''
</P>
<P>
   Some defiant dealers are refusing to supply books for its Web
site, which draws titles from booksellers lower in the literary
chain and then inspects and marks them up for sale. Others are
searching for alternatives, testing a cooperative Web site of
dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are booksellers who are happily working with the
high-profile newcomer, arguing that Alibris is trying to do what
the vast majority could never afford _ expand the rarified demand
for rare and used books into a mass market.
</P>
<P>
   The hostilities that Alibris has provoked among some traditional
booksellers mirror the same tensions that other industries are
facing over issues of consolidation and the loss of personal
connections. Alibris has stirred the anxieties of many dealers, in
large part because of its corporate trappings and strategies that
stand out among the others like a new paperback on a shelf of
leather-bound editions.
</P>
<P>
   It is not as if Alibris is simply introducing new technology to
the business. The Internet has already helped increase the number
and reach of independent dealers. According to Siegel's survey, the
business has expanded strongly since 1996, gaining 21 percent more
dealers to reach 7,095 last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has enabled many sellers of used book to expand
their customer base to the entire world,'' Siegel said. Sales over
the Web make up from 10 to 50 percent of gross sales for the
dealers she has tracked.
</P>
<P>
   But the vast majority of these dealers are tiny operations. By
contrast, Alibris has a growing staff of 100 at its administrative
offices in Emeryville, a warehouse of books in Sparks, Nev. and
another distribution warehouse planned for England.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as the trade has evolved in the last two years, the
titans from the glossier side of the book business are developing a
yearning for dogeared dustjackets. Amazon.com bought
Bibliofind.com, a database for used book dealers last April.
Barnesandnoble.com struck a supply partnership with Alibris earlier
this year. This month, the nation's largest book distributor,
Ingram Book Group, announced its participation in a $30 million
round of new financing to support Alibris' marketing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Its pricey Madison Avenue advertising campaign has appeared in
The New Yorker, USA Today and Gourmet, promoting battered copies of
books like Lewis Padgett's '50s vintage ``Mutant.'' (April 11,
1977. Freaked you out so bad you had to bury it. Jan. 25, 2000.
Unearth on Alibris for son who shares your sci-fi gene.'')
</P>
<P>
   There's more to come. In the next five years, said Martin
Manley, chief executive of the company, Alibris hopes to spend at
least $100 million to market its titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people have tried to computerize the supply side of the
business,'' said Manley, a former assistant secretary of labor in
the Clinton administration. ``But nobody has taken on the job of
creating demand for this product. Most people believe they can't
find books from their childhood, but using e-commerce techniques we
can bring those materials to the market and we can educate these
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Even with the recent market rumblings, taking the company public
is a strategy that Alibris is still considering for the future,
Manley said. ``Changes in the capital market are not going to
change the business strategy,'' he said. ``We've always been
focused on the retailer and distributor because nobody else is.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Alibris bills itself as the leading source of rare and
hard-to-find books, but there are other existing online services
for used books with a larger pool of dealers _ at least for the
moment. Advanced Book Exchange, which is based in Victoria, British
Columbia offers books from more than 6,000 dealers, compared with
about 1,500 that Alibris says have joined its fold.
</P>
<P>
   But Alibris is moving aggressively to expand. Last October, it
announced the purchase of Bibliocity, an electronic source of rare
and antiquarian books. Meanwhile, Alibris has been eyeing ABE, with
its list of almost four million titles and 18 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Alibris had made overtures to its competitor, Manley
chose his words carefully: ``We've never had substantial
discussions with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Some independent dealers fear that Alibris is moving to create a
monopoly, a fear that was intensified by some recent sharp
Internet-style elbowing for space. In early March,
Barnesandnoble.com alerted antiquarian dealers that it had struck a
new partnership with Alibris to fill its used book orders. That
means that Alibris will be listed first when customers request
out-of-print books from the BN.com Web site. In the past, those
orders had been filled primarily through ABE, which will now be the
second choice.
</P>
<P>
   This change provoked dissent among many dealers because they
could earn more money offering titles through Advanced Book
Exchange, which charges about a $35 monthly fee to list 3,000 books
and leaves it to dealers to fill the orders directly and to keep
the price of the book. In contrast, Alibris exacts about a 20
percent cut of the dealer's final retail price.It operates by
demanding copies for inspection at its Nevada distribution site,
and then repackages the title under the Alibris brand at a
marked-up price for reshipment to a customer.
</P>
<P>
   What particularly irritates some dealers is that the Alibris
process eliminates direct contact with the customer. From her
cramped 840-square-foot Red Wheelbarrow Bookstore in Milwaukee,
Barbara Lightner refuses to list any of the titles in her book
collection specializing in ``avant garde'' political literature.
Instead, she hopes to maintain contact with a wide range of
customers directly through the Internet, which already accounts for
30 percent of her revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barnesandnoble drove a lot of independents out of business and
some used book dealers said Alibris could never do that to us
because we control the supply chain,'' said Lightner, a former
literature instructor at Purdue University who started her
bookstore about two years ago. ``But some of us are concerned that
they could control the databases that we use to make our Internet
sales, and they would be able to destroy our ability to make as
much money on those sales.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Judith Lowry, a second generation bookseller and co-owner of the
seven-decade-old Argosy Book Store suspects that Internet sales are
having an impact on walk-in traffic for her six-story bookstore in
Manhattan. For the first time in 10 years in-store sales are down
slightly. But she gives credit to Alibris for its advertising
campaign, which she says is having a balancing, positive effect.
``As they advertise more, we get more orders,'' she said. ``When we
first started we'd sell five books a week and now it's 15 books
this morning for Alibris.''
</P>
<P>
   The multiplication of online sales has allowed dealers like
Christine Volk, of Volk &AMP; Iams Booksellers, to work from Amador
County in the foothills of rural northern California. Her Internet
sales make up her entire business, which specializes in first
editions in African-American and children's literature. Working
from her outpost with a view of snow-capped Sierras and wild
turkeys, she maintains contact with customers through email and a
new Web site, Bookfever.com.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn DeWeese-Parkinson, a former trial lawyer, makes about 80
percent of his sales on-line and the rest by appointment and
catalogue sales from his home in Cornelius, Oregon. He also
shepherds a continuing and lively debate among book dealers through
his electronic bulletin board, Bibliophile.
</P>
<P>
   For both Volk and DeWeese-Parkinson customer contact _ in all
forms _ is the difference between being a bookseller or a supplier.
It is the reason they do not list their books with Alibris.
</P>
<P>
   Alibris' chief executive, Manley, said he sympathizes with
dealers who want to maintain close ties with customers. But ``a
brand is a promise of reliability, quality, returnability,'' he
said, ``and you can't build a brand out of 2,000 dealers. You build
a brand out of a name.''
</P>
<P>
   That notion is like a red flag for DeWeese-Parkinson whose
specialty is Mexican bullfighting literature. ``Alibris stands
between me and the customer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that as a small specialty dealer the only way I can
stay in business is to be buying for those customers.''
</P>
<P>
   In many cases those relationships are held together by e-mail
since his customers are scattered around the world from Pamplona,
Spain to Providence R.I. ``Finding those people,'' he said, ``is
much more important than the hot experience of finding a nifty book
in a corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Those relationships are at the heart of what makes selling rare
books so personal. When his 22-year-old daughter, Meggan Parkinson,
died in a car crash in May 1997 his book customers arranged for
masses to be said in Guatemala, the United States, Spain and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Before his daughter's death, DeWeese-Parkinson had planned to
race along with her during the running of the bulls in Pamplona.
Instead one of his regular customers, Joe Distler, ran with the
bulls, wearing a sash with Meggan's name.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ For 35 years, Ramon Saul Sanchez, the man now behind the
army of Little Havana demonstrators, waged war with a cabal of
likeminded warriors. The men, who belonged to a network of
paramilitary groups, practiced armed combat in the underbrush,
plotted violent overthrows of Fidel Castro and, in some cases,
planted real bombs that did real damage.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the early 1980s, Sanchez, under subpoena, refused to
testify before a grand jury against one of the fiercest anti-Castro
paramilitary groups, Omega 7. He served four and a half years in an
Indiana prison, and walked out a disciple of the Rev. Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Sanchez, with his round-the-clock vigils outside the home
of Elian Gonzalez's great-uncle and his campaigns of civil
disobedience, has emerged as a pivotal figure in the standoff over
the 6-year-old Cuban boy. And in so doing, he has elbowed his way
into the Cuban-American political hierarchy that has long been
ruled by a handful of powerful organizations, most notably the
Cuban-American National Foundation, a lobbying group.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly five months of fruitless wrangling with the Justice
Department, Congress and the courts, it is Sanchez's street
tactics, and not the work of the mainstream Cuban-American leaders,
that has forced the federal government to back down repeatedly from
reuniting Elian with his father, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to sweat with the people, cry with the people, hope
with the people, go to jail with the people and also smile,'' said
Sanchez, 46, who lives with his parents and says he owns only a
white Sidekick and a heap of clothes. ``You have to be with them.
You can't get them to respond to you, if you are on the 10th floor
of a building somewhere trying to direct them by remote control.''
</P>
<P>
   But in moving the focus from the office towers to the streets,
Sanchez has done more than just add a fresh dimension to the fight
for Elian's future, as he puts it. He also has broken from the path
Cuban Americans have traditionally chosen in battling Fidel Castro,
a course that began early on with guns and bombs under the cover of
darkness and later shifted to money and influence in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Although it remains the dominant political organization in
Miami's Cuban community, and many still cherish it, the
Cuban-American National Foundation has been struggling to keep its
footing, clout and relevance since the 1997 death of its powerful
leader Jorge Mas Canosa, some exile leaders and academic experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   In the Elian case, the group has done what it does best,
lobbying Congress and the Justice Department to resolve the
situation peacefully and give Elian's relatives in Miami the chance
to make their case in court.
</P>
<P>
   But a telling moment came last week, when its president, Jorge
Mas Santos, Mas Canosa's son, set out to broker a deal in
Washington that would have reunited the two families. After the
deal was done, he announced the arrangement in front of television
cameras.
</P>
<P>
   But the crowd in Little Havana, outraged over the possibility of
having to turn the boy over, prodded Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's
great-uncle, to reject the deal. Angrily, Gonzalez did just that in
a late-night news conference. Some in the community saw it as a
defiant gesture of independence from the group.
</P>
<P>
   Mas, who is nevertheless routinely cheered in front of the
house, said last week in an interview that the Justice Department
had changed the ground rules after the deal had been struck. At
that point the Foundation backed away from the arrangement, as did
the family in Miami, Mas said.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory B. Craig, the lawyer for Elian's father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, has denied that.
</P>
<P>
   The inability to finalize the deal has been seen by some experts
as the kind of shakiness in the Foundation's leadership that has
left room for an upstart like Sanchez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the death of Mas Canosa, Sanchez has been the
Cuban-American leader that has gained the most prominence,'' said
Dario Moreno, an associate professor of political science at
Florida International University, who said Cuban leaders often view
street demonstrations as counter-productive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the other political leaders have much more political
power and much more influence in the boardrooms,'' he added. ``But
it is Ramon Saul Sanchez who has influence in the streets, in being
able to control the protests.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez often evokes the disdain and skepticism of more
traditional exile leaders, and even some academics caution that his
influence is untested over the long term and could fade when the
Elian case is over.
</P>
<P>
   Ninoska Perez, a spokeswoman for the Foundation, sidestepped the
opportunity to be critical of Sanchez, and wondered whether any
political group has persuaded people to turn out in such large
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of the people there don't necessarily belong to
one organization or another,'' she said. ``They are there because
of their dedication to the cause of Elian.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez's organization, Movimiento Democracia, runs on a
shoestring budget of $5 and $10 contributions, and some in the
community point out that he has few political connections or
accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   At worst, Sanchez is seen as an interloper who angers people by
tying up traffic and using publicity stunts to promote himself. In
the end, it may be that Sanchez has served only to prolong Elian's
inevitable return, a delay that could further sully the reputation
of the Cuban-American community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody in Ramon Saul Sanchez's position is almost in a
situation where they either have to make something happen or
something has to happen that they didn't create, like Elian,'' said
Jose Garcia-Pedrosa, a lawyer for Lazaro Gonzalez, and a fixture in
the Cuban-American elite. ``That inures to Sanchez's detriment
because you can't always control these events.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many other Cuban-American powerbrokers, Sanchez has
publicly immersed himself in the Elian case, and many people in the
community have responded to his dedication and his rapport with the
demonstrators. He sleeps only a few hours a night in a trailer near
Gonzalez's house, fueling himself with Cuban coffee and adrenaline.
His cell phone rings every 30 seconds, it seems; last month, it
logged 6,200 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He is different from traditional leaders, who are mostly
upper-middle-class professionals, in one other way, as well; he
earns $30,000 as a clerk for a nonprofit housing group. Few in the
community had ever heard of him five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   When the crowd gets too riled-up, or a skirmish threatens, he
sprints for the barricades, grabs a megaphone and soothes people,
mostly by dispelling rumors and reminding them that their ugly
behavior will taint the community's already tarnished image. One
night, outside of the house of Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin, where a
group had gathered while Elian was inside, Sanchez headed off a
confrontation by urging people to form a large prayer circle.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, he has gained the trust of the family and now acts as
one of their advisers; at this late date, he is still gently
persuading them to meet with Elian's father to try to ensure a
peaceful outcome.
</P>
<P>
   In January, when the government first stepped-up the pressure on
the Gonzalez family, Sanchez, whose good looks and measured charm
have turned him into a media darling, helped organized the first
major demonstration, a march through downtown Miami and a sit-in in
front of the Port of Miami. A number of people were peacefully
arrested that day. He has also called for traffic tie-ups, which
has drawn the ire of Miami residents.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he has helped orchestrate, with the support of
Spanish-language radio, the nightly vigils, all of them peaceful,
along with the idea for the human chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has managed to control the situation really well,'' said
Jose Basulto, the head of Brothers to the Rescue, a prominent
Cuban-American group. ``At any given time, the possibility of
demonstrations has kept Janet Reno from sending the boy back to
Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez said he set out 13 years ago to create an alternative to
the major groups and their way of doing things by promoting
nonviolence and civil disobedience. ``I got called some names as
you can imagine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His group first drew attention with its yearly flotilla, a
contingent of boats that pressed right up to Cuban waters. Once
there, flowers were dropped and prayers were sent Cuba's way. It
was pure symbolic theater. But when the U.S. government seized one
of his boats in 1998, he went on a hunger strike to get it back and
lost 31 pounds in 21 days. People in the community started to take
notice.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last summer, when the Coast Guard used fire hoses on a
group of Cuban refugees who had sailed on to a local beach, Sanchez
mobilized people to block the major bridge leading to Miami Beach,
the tourist mecca. That helped persuade the federal government not
to send the refugees back.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some question whether Sanchez's tactics will really do much to
turn Cuba into a democracy. ``He is as much a part of the problem
as the solution,'' said Max Castro, who researches exile politics
at the University of Miami. ``As much as I disagree with the
Foundation completely, it's a serious organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez said he worries mostly about keeping the peace among
demonstrators now, especially if marshals have to tear Elian away
from his relatives. ``How do we show people that we do care about
the nation and the laws?'' he asked rhetorically. ``How do we focus
the attention of the world back on Cuba?''
</P>
<P>
   The endgame could make or break this fledgling leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he succeeds,'' Basulto said. ``But it will be a test of
his ability to control the crowd if this thing takes place in front
of the eyes of everybody there.''

ETHIOPIANS WITH JEWISH ROOTS YEARN TO GO TO ISRAEL
</HEADLINE>
 By IAN FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia _ The Jewish center was packed on Tuesday,
the day before Passover. Children sang in Hebrew. The ritual bath
was filled. Three rows of workers flattened dough for matzo, baked
in 30 ovens so smoky that the place seemed on fire.
</P>
<P>
   If the people at the Beta Israel Community are not really Jews _
and the Israeli government says it has doubts _ they certainly work
hard at their religious practices.
</P>
<P>
   They are among the 26,000 people still in Ethiopia who claim to
be Jewish and want to leave for Israel. To them and their many
supporters, they are the ones left behind. In Israel, the Ethiopian
population has increased to 70,000 people after waves of
immigration since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something special,'' Andrew Goldman, an American with a
charity that assists the group, said on Tuesday as he helped
prepare the center for Passover, which celebrates the exodus from
Egypt. ``These people have been crossing the Red Sea in my
lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Israeli government has been slow to act on their
requests, saying their ties to Judaism are not as certain as those
of the Ethiopians who clearly maintained their faith and were
allowed to emigrate in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Some government officials say they worry that the motives are
really economic: Ethiopia is one of the poorest nations, made worse
by a severe food shortage in the last several months, and Jews here
are among the worst off.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, pressure has mounted over the issue, as the Israeli
Supreme Court last month ordered the government to develop a plan
to process the Ethiopians' immigration applications. Earlier this
month, Natan Sharansky, the Israeli interior minister, visited to
see the situation firsthand.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of his trip, he promised that applications would be
handled more quickly. Some people have been waiting 10 years. And
he said he was horrified at the cramped and filthy houses where
people are living.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can compare them only to the punishment cells in the Soviet
Union, in which I spent years,'' Sharansky, a former Soviet
dissident, told reporters in Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
   But he was firm that Israel would approve only those with strong
claims under the law that governs who is considered Jewish. ``We
can't open up for everyone who wants to come,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They are known as Falash Mura, and what complicates their claim
to be Jewish is that in many cases, their families converted to
Christianity a few generations ago. Descendants say the families
did so to avoid an emerging persecution from Ethiopia's large
Christian population.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were hated,'' said Mitiku Yalew, chairman of the Addis
Ababa Beta Israel Community. ``They told us we had the evil eye.''
</P>
<P>
   His story is like many others. His grandfather, he said, was a
practicing Jew near Gondar in the rugged north who taught Hebrew.
Fifty years ago, as Christians in the area harassed the Jews, his
father converted.
</P>
<P>
   But Yalew said the conversion was only ``pretend,'' a situation
that often was plain to Christians, too. The family did not go to
church. There was little intermarriage. Many Falash Mura still
cannot be buried in Christian cemeteries.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many people gave up Jewish religious practices
because they were afraid of provoking their neighbors. ``We didn't
have any teachers to teach us about the Torah,'' said Yalew, who
began observing Judaism five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Yeshinesh Koye, 19, said her grandfather converted to
Christianity, but the family ended up practicing neither religion
until recently. She has a cross tattooed to her forehead, common
among the Falash Mura as a way of convincing Christians that they
were not Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why she began to observe Judaism, she answered: ``It is my
religion. It is inherited from my ancestors.''
</P>
<P>
   This ambiguity makes it hard to sort out the claims, Israeli
officials say. Sharansky noted that there are few written records.
And officials worry that if they let in these 26,000, many others
will claim to be Jews to better their lives in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that most of them lead terrible lives. With the hope
of emigrating in the early 1990's, many left their villages for the
cities. Their land was taken over, and now they live as urban
refugees of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   Gedamu Kassa, 75, sick and bone-thin, lives in a small room made
with walls made of cow manure with his wife and four other family
members. His son lives in Israel. ``Most of our relatives have gone
to Israel and we want to join them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Falash Mura and their supporters reject the idea that they
are economic refugees alone. Many of them have relatives among the
4,000 Falash Mura who have made it to Israel, and who lead
religious lives there, supporters say. ``If they were just economic
refugees there would be no reason for them to do that,'' said
Joseph Feit, a New York tax lawyer on the board of the North
American Conference on Ethiopian Jewry, the charity that Goldman
works for. In the United States, the three branches of Judaism
support emigration for the Falash Mura, and in Israel too there are
many groups backing them.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has accepted thousands of Russians, not all of them
Jewish by Jewish law, a fact that the Ethiopians have noticed.
``Since we are black there are serious investigations,'' Yalew
said. ``For Russians, they don't do the same thing. That is racism.
That's a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   As they wait, the Falash Mura busy themselves at the center in
Addis Ababa and another in Gondar. Most go there to pray three
times a day. Nearly 5,000 children attend school at the centers,
singing the Israeli national anthem before class. The center
employs 850 people to embroider scenes of Ethiopian Jewish life,
which are made into pillows and sold in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   One of the embroiderers is Desalegn Gibte, 55, who stitches
embroidery for about $20 a month. ``We are doing this just to get
paid,'' he said. ``We barely get enough to pay rent.''

`GREEN BIRD': THE TAYMOR WIZARDRY TAKES ON RIBALD FANTASY

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If the Tony Awards had a category for best
performance by a piece of fruit in a musical role, there's no
question about which current Broadway show would provide the
winner. Ditto for best performance by an actor denied the use of
the upper two-thirds of his face. And for best use of eyelids by an
oversize broken statue.
</P>
<P>
   These unlikely nominees are among the highlights of ``The Green
Bird,'' Julie Taymor's alternately enchanting and tedious
adaptation of Carlo Gozzi's 18th-century fable and a production
that definitely stakes out an unclaimed patch in the shifting
landscape of Broadway entertainments.
</P>
<P>
   Taymor, whose distinctive brand of theatrical wizardry became
world famous when she translated Disney's ``Lion King'' cartoon to
the stage, sets her sights here on an adult audience with a
childlike capacity for wonder, creating a ribald world in which the
impossible is a matter of course.
</P>
<P>
   Big, shiny McIntosh-like apples split open to reveal
platinum-blond sirens at their cores; a naked marble goddess of a
statue melts into animation; a pyramid of chattering skulls guard
the exquisite little bird of the title. Such visions occur often
enough that toward the play's end, its characters grow impatient
with all these fairy-tale shenanigans. ``What miracle?'' one of
them asks. ``I'm used to this by now.''
</P>
<P>
   Theatergoers are unlikely to feel equally blase about the
Ovidian transformations that Taymor and company keep conjuring in
``The Green Bird,'' which opened Tuesday night at the Cort Theater.
It's the wait between miracles that's the problem.
</P>
<P>
   That Taymor has guts, style and artistic ambition to burn is
indisputable. Who else would reintroduce masks as an essential part
of actors' costumes and characters? Who else who would dare present
a long philosophical fairy tale, performed in commedia dell'arte
style and of a length and whimsy unsuitable for most children, in
the land of ``Footloose'' and ``Saturday Night Fever''?
</P>
<P>
   As anyone knows who has seen her ``Lion King'' or her recent
film fantasia of Shakespeare's bloody ``Titus Andronicus,'' Taymor
plies a creative vocabulary unlike that of any other director in
mainstream show business. The eclecticism that has been going under
the rubric postmodern for several decades doesn't begin to describe
her work.
</P>
<P>
   The sources of her theatrical tools, which range from shadow
puppets to shamanlike masks, stretch back over millennia, not mere
decades, and span all manner of civilizations. And there's no
distancing irony in the presentation of these elements, no breezy
quotation marks.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a lighter mood, which ``The Green Bird'' more or less
represents, Taymor is gravely asking audiences to respond to the
eternal in ritualized theater, to the ceremonial transfiguration of
the ordinary into the symbolic. Or as a program note for ``The
Green Bird'' concludes, ``Do we go to the theater to see ourselves
reflected, or to be transported elsewhere?''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the objective, a piece of theater has to keep you
engaged on its own terms for as long as the house lights are down.
``The Green Bird,'' a long and winding tale of royal twins on an
allegorical journey to self-knowledge, dazzles in its flights of
imagery, but when the connecting story takes over, you may find
your thoughts drifting to unreturned phone calls and unclaimed dry
cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Green Bird'' _ which features attractively varied music
by Elliot Goldenthal and the crack design team of Christine Jones
(sets), Constance Hoffman (costumes) and Donald Holder (lighting) _
was first seen in an off- Broadway production at the New Victory
Theater in 1996. Its basic elements, including its most spectacular
set pieces and much of its cast, remain the same. Taymor and her
ensemble have definitely come some distance in creating a cohesive
style of performance.
</P>
<P>
   The best of the performers achieve an enlivening fusion of flesh
and artifice. As Tartaglia, a self-described ``melancholy
monarch,'' Derek Smith, who won an Obie award for the part four
years ago, is saddled with an immense, jug-eared artificial head
that suggests Prince Charles in a fun house mirror. He is also
wonderfully expressive.
</P>
<P>
   True, he seems to wear his head as if it were an annoying but
necessary encumbrance, but then don't we all from time to time?
Smith has come up with an alphabet of physical gestures,
exaggerated but fluid, that do indeed melt the man and the mask
into one.
</P>
<P>
   Other performers, though not on the same level, often bring a
balletic grace to antic shtick. They include Edward Hibbert as an
evil queen mother who wears a bustle the size of a coffee table;
Didi Conn and Ned Eisenberg as a Punch-and-Judy pair of sausage
makers; and the wonderful Kristine Nielsen as Tartaglia's wronged
queen, who is imprisoned in the castle sewers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There are also, memorably, Bruce Turk, who actually seems to
become the green bird puppet he manipulates with a stick; Sophia
Salguero as the Jean Harlowesque leader of a trio of singing apples
with tree-tall stems and the heavy-lidded, house-size head of a
statue named Calmon, whose voice is supplied by Andrew Weems.
</P>
<P>
   The only central characters who wear their own faces are
Barbarina (Katie MacNichol) and Renzo (Sebastian Roche), orphaned
twins who discover their parentage only after learning the perils
of false philosophy, greed and vanity as well as of dragons and
dancing skeletons.
</P>
<P>
   Their deliberately stilted performances bring to mind those
story theater productions that tour schools. Not having your own
mask in a Taymor production is definitely a disadvantage. You have
to feel that Hibbert's queen has a point when he observes
disdainfully of Barbarina that the girl has ``no dowry, no parents,
no mask.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the pinnacle of verbal comedy in this ``Green Bird,''
which has been translated by Albert Bermel and Ted Emery from the
Italian, although room seems to have been left for improvised jokes
that range from the scatological to shameless topical puns.
(Barbarina's lingerie is said to come from ``Vittoria's Da
Secret.'')
</P>
<P>
   Many of the raunchier elements are provided by an evil
soothsayer (Reg E. Cathey) who talks in rap and reggae and provides
sexual services to the queen. Taymor's wit is clearly more visual
than verbal, and her sense of the transcendent moment stronger than
her gift for narrative.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with allegorical characters is that they walk a
predetermined path and respond in predetermined ways. No matter how
elaborately and imaginatively they are dressed up, there has to be
something surprising about them that comes from within if they are
to keep us company for any length of time.
</P>
<P>
   The visual eclat and creative energy in ``The Green Bird'' could
happily fill a show half as long. At its current two hours and 15
minutes, the production is like an oversize art gallery where the
pictures are ravishing but there's a lot of bare wall between them.

DRUG APPROVED TO FIGHT ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANT SUPERBUGS 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Mass., Minn., N.D.)   By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Food and Drug Administration approved a drug
Tuesday that is considered an important new weapon in the fight
against antibiotic-resistant germs.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, Zyvox, is the first in a new family of antibiotics,
and the first medicine in more than 40 years to treat a potentially
lethal strain of staphylococcus that is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   The approval of Zyvox, made by the Pharmacia Corp. of Peapack,
N.J., comes as doctors are increasingly concerned about so-called
superbugs, including some that even resist vancomycin, long
regarded as the antibiotic of last resort for a range of
disease-causing germs.
</P>
<P>
   Zyvox, which goes by the generic name linezolid, is not a
panacea. It only works against certain disease-causing bacteria,
and in studies of patients with the toughest infections _ those
that cannot be treated with vancomycin _ it cured only two-thirds
of the cases.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, infectious disease experts said the drug could help
thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, of people each year,
especially those in hospitals and nursing homes, where microbes
quickly attack the elderly, people with weak immune systems and
other vulnerable patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a major advance to have this option,'' said Dr. George
Eliopolous, an infectious disease expert at Beth Israel Medical
Center in Boston. ``They are hitting the market at a good time,
when we are starting to see more of these bacterial infections.''
</P>
<P>
   The FDA approved Zyvox as a treatment for several types of
illnesses. Most important among them, experts said, are the skin
infections and pneumonia caused by a deadly bacteria, enterococcus
faecium, that does not succumb to vancomycin.
</P>
<P>
   This strain _ known by the acronym VREF, for
vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium _ first emerged in 1989,
then spread rapidly. By 1997, according to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta, half of all enterococcus faecium
germs could not be attacked by vancomycin. About 14,000 patients a
year get sick from the germ, an agency official said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, another antibiotic, Synercid, was approved to treat
VREF. But Zyvox has an advantage: Synercid is given by injection
only, while Zyvox can be administered both intravenously and in
pill form. Thus, doctors can prescribe it in the hospital and send
patients home to continue treatment without cumbersome intravenous
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that it is approved for oral use is important,'' said
Dr. David M. Bell, an expert in antibiotic resistance at the
center. Referring to both Zyvox and Synercid, which is made by
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, Bell said, ``We are delighted to see these new
drugs coming out of the pipeline and into clinical use.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to drug-resistant enterococcus bacteria, scientists
have grown concerned about the rise of another microbe,
staphylococcus aureas, that has outwitted most antibiotics. Last
year, the CDC found that more than 200 people in North Dakota and
Minnesota had become sick, and four children died, from infection
with this germ, which in theory should have succumbed to
vancomycin.
</P>
<P>
   Studies by Pharmacia found that Zyvox was at least as effective
as vancomycin against this germ, which infects about 80,000 people
a year. ``Up until now, vancomycin has been the only approved drug
to treat those infections,'' said Dr. Gary Chikami, director of
anti-infective drug products at the FDA. ``Zyvox represents an
important addition.''
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacia began testing Zyvox about a decade ago, and the drug
was first tested in patients in 1994, according to Cameron Durrant,
the company's vice president for infectious disease. The drug is
the first to be introduced by the company since its merger last
month with Monsanto. ``We think it meets a very strong unmet
need,'' Durrant said.
</P>
<P>
   Zyvox is a member of an new family of medications, the
oxazolidine class; it works by blocking the formation of proteins
that enable bacteria to spread inside the body.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean bacteria cannot become resistant to it;
Chikami, the FDA official, said that during clinical testing a few
patients' vancomycin-resistant enterococcus infections also became
resistant to Zyvox.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, government officials say doctors should use the new
drug with caution. ``It is likely that in time that resistance will
develop,'' Bell said. ``So we need to use these new drugs
judiciously.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Burt Meyers, an infectious disease expert at Mount Sinai
School of Medicine, in Manhattan, said there is another reason
doctors should use Zyvox sparingly: its cost. Vancomycin, which he
described as ''the drug of choice at this time,'' is relatively
inexpensive, costing about $14 a day, Meyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Zyvox may cost more than ten times that amount. Durrant said
that Pharmacia would not set a price until next week, but that
Zyvox would likely cost slightly less than Synercid's price of $180
to $250 a day.

MARLA RUNYAN: RUNNER HAS DISABILITY AND AN OLYMPIC GOAL
</HEADLINE>
  By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. _ Her boyfriend downloaded a story about her first
road race and handed the printout to Marla Runyan in their tiny
apartment with the Olympic rings on the living room wall. She
placed the story in a magnifying device and scanned the paragraphs,
knowing that somewhere prominently it would be mentioned that her
vision was severely impaired.
</P>
<P>
   ``There it is, `the legally blind runner,''' the 31-year-old
Runyan said. ``At least it's not in the headline.''
</P>
<P>
   Runyan suffers from a degenerative condition of the retina
called Stargardt's disease, which has left her with a hole in the
center of her vision. She has 20-300 vision in one eye, 20-400 in
the other. She cannot see the tape at the finish line of the metric
mile. She cannot read a stopwatch or watch a replay of her races
without pressing her face several inches from the television. She
wears contacts and can see the track beneath her feet with
peripheral vision, but her competitors are visible to her as shards
of color and smudged faces and gauzy hair styles.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her impairment, Runyan has an encouraging chance at the
Olympic track and field trials in July to become the first legally
blind athlete to make an American team for the Winter or Summer
Games. She has a chance to make the team at 800 meters, 1,500
meters or 5,000 meters. Runyan began running the 1,500 meters only
last year but posted a personal best of 4 minutes 5.27 seconds;
anything under 4 minutes is considered a very fast time, and only
three runners in the world broke the 4-minute mark last year.
Runyan also finished 4th at the 1999 national championships, 1st at
the Pan American Games and 10th at the world championships in
Seville, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   She is one of the country's most versatile athletes, having
finished 10th in the heptathlon at the 1996 Olympic trials and
having set a national record for the heptathlon 800 meters in
2:04.70. She also won the 2000 national indoor championship at
3,000 meters, leading the entire race to win in 9:01.29. Her career
is remarkable for many reasons beyond her visual impairment, and
there is a hint of impatience and deflection in Runyan's voice when
the subject of her eyesight arises, because such talk inevitably
centers on limitation instead of possibility. She is restless for
the day when someone will write about her as an athlete, not a
legally blind athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never say that if it wasn't for Stargardt's, I could
run three seconds faster,'' Runyan said. ``To me, it's not true. I
should be prepared and experienced enough that it isn't going to be
a factor. If I break a national record, maybe they will stop
writing about my eyes. It's a matter of commitment. Some people
have a bad attitude and that's their disability.''
</P>
<P>
   She looks slightly to the side when she speaks, seeing with her
peripheral vision, and she prefers to talk about what is possible,
not impossible.
</P>
<P>
   She had an epiphany stepping onto the track at the world
championships in Seville last August, she said. Even with her sooty
vision, she was struck by the fractured beauty of the moment, the
rim of the stadium with its hanging flags, the splendid flashes of
color, the brightness and crispness of the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I could never go back to a regular life,'' Runyan said.
``Things would never be the same. I know it's strange for someone
with 20-400 vision to say everything looked clear, but it was so
magnified that it seemed clear to me. I couldn't distinguish
individual things, but I could see bright, magnificent colors.
Colors seemed to stand out more than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, which begin
Sept. 15, the stadium will be even bigger, the colors just as
riotous. Certainly, the news-media coverage will be more extensive
than when Trischa Zorn, a visually impaired swimmer, narrowly
failed to qualify for the boycotted 1980 Moscow Olympics, and when
Jim Mastro served as an alternate on the wrestling team at the 1976
Montreal Olympics. So, the inspiration that Runyan provides as a
legally blind elite athlete is incalculable, said Charlie Huebner,
executive director of the United States Association for Blind
Athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``All young blind kids aren't being told they can dream about
something,'' Huebner said. ``Marla is a huge role model. `I can go
to college, I can be a teacher, I can be a world-class athlete.' If
you have high expectations, anything is possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Runyan owns numerous world records and gold medals from
competing at the Paralympics in 1992 and '96, but her feelings
toward the association for blind athletes simmer in ambivalence and
frustration. Before the 1992 Paralympics, she said, a doctor
accused her of exaggerating her vision problems in order to win a
trip to the disabled-athlete games in Barcelona, Spain. Before the
1996 Paralympics, she said, officials attempted to make her qualify
for the heptathlon on a cement track, this after she had just
competed in the Olympic trials in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``When you join an organization based on your visual acuity
rather than your athletic ability, you're not really with
athletes,'' Runyan said. ``Although, there are some incredible
blind athletes. I prefer to look at them as athletes who have
something wrong with their eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Since her vision began to deteriorate when she was 9 and living
in Camarillo, Calif., she has succeeded by refusing to live a life
of lowered expectations. When she could no longer see well enough,
at age 14, to follow a soccer ball, she switched to track and field
and set a school record in the high jump at 5 foot 7 inches.
</P>
<P>
   At San Diego State University, Runyan competed not in one event,
but in seven, the heptathlon. When she could not see the hurdles in
front of her, she learned to jump by counting steps between the
hurdles. Her coach taped playing cards to the hurdles to teach her
to clear them by only a slight margin. Sometimes she used
reflective tape to help her locate the high-jump bar and a tape
measure to precisely calibrate her approach.
</P>
<P>
   She excelled in the classroom as well as on the track. Her
mother, Valerie Runyan, painstakingly wrote out enlarged versions
of her reading material in high school. With the help of a
magnifying device attached to a pair of glasses, she could read
large-print books. She used visual-aid devices, audio books and
assistants who read to her in college, graduating cum laude in
1991, then earning a masters degree in education of the
handicapped. She learned to water ski and scuba dive, and she was
able to get her California driver's license with the help of a
telescopic magnifying lens; she is not allowed to drive in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has put herself through a lot of pain and suffering not to
fail,'' said her father, Gary Runyan. ``I think a lot of it is
driven by a lack of vision and still wanting to succeed in spite of
it. The biggest thing her mother and I did was not to set up any
artificial barriers for Marla. We let her find her own barriers.
Some she found painfully. But she also found the things she could
do.''
</P>
<P>
   After setting a national record in the heptathlon 800 meters at
the 1996 Olympic trials, Runyan decided to discard the field events
and concentrate on running. However, she sustained a series of
knee, foot and hip injuries and disappeared from the racing scene
for two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was limping around Eugene in a raincoat,'' she said.
Finally, last season, her 5-7 frame pared from 135 pounds to 116,
she took up the 1,500. In her fourth race, she chased down Leah
Pells of Canada and out-leaned her at the wire to win the Pan
American Games. Her sixth race came in the finals of the world
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing what she's done,'' said Maurice Greene, the
world's fastest man. ``She's had to overcome a lot more than most
athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   What Runyan needs most in the 1,500 this Olympic season is
experience. She has a ravenous appetite for information, using a
screen enlarger on her computer to surf the Web, or having her
boyfriend, Matt Lonergan, a former college runner, read newspapers
and magazines to her. She sits a few inches from the television and
together they watch the videotaped races of great runners. Her own
stride is beautifully strong and fluid, but, of course, there are
inevitable small complications for any runner who is legally blind.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Runyan nearly ran off the course at her first road
race, which may have cost her third place, her father said, and she
is bothered by the sun, especially in late afternoon. She relies on
the cluster of officials and timing devices, seeing them out of the
corner of her eye, to gauge the finish line. Because she cannot see
her competitor's faces, or read their numbers, she takes her cues
from their styles of running. And she has a tendency to run
slightly wide on the track, adding distance to her races, because
she is not yet comfortable or confident enough with the jostling of
the pack.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's got to be able to find herself in a position within a
pack and be comfortable and not worry about it,'' Mike Manley, her
coach, said. ``That's all part of experience. What she's done so
far in such as short time is incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   If the pack strings out, and she finds herself more than three
or four seconds off the pace, Runyan can also struggle to find the
leaders. In the final of the world championship, she found it
difficult to anticipate the speeding up and slowing down that takes
place in a tactical race. At one point, she ran up onto the
shoulder of Svetlana Masterkova of Russia and Regina Jacobs of the
United States, who would finish first and second, then she found
herself being passed by other runners both on the inside and
outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it was something visual I missed, or whether
it was a lack of experience,'' Runyan said.
</P>
<P>
   That's what this spring and summer are for. Experience. Gary
Runyan has begun to have dreams of his daughter in Sydney. ``The
joy I would feel for her would be overwhelming,'' he said. ``The
other day, I fell asleep watching something on TV, and I dreamed
she was coming out of the tunnel in Sydney. She was the flag bearer
for the United States. It seemed so real. It seemed like it almost
happened. Maybe it can.''

MARKET PLACE: BOOSTER OF ONLINE TRADING IS VICTIM OF MARGIN
PITFALLS 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: N.Y., Fla., Conn., N.M., N.J.)  (See also MARKET) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Among the many evangelists for online investing who
have appeared in recent years, few have been as ubiquitous as
Baruch Israel Hertz. His New York company, with its constant
advertisements on CNBC, promises to make investing a cinch even for
novices, providing stock quotes, market information and easy access
to electronic trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to be a pro to trade like one,'' he says on the
Web site of his stock-trading system, MyTrack.
</P>
<P>
   But when stocks plunged Friday, many investors who had borrowed
heavily to play the market suddenly faced demands from their
lenders that they put up more money to cover their losses. And one
of the biggest losers was Hertz.
</P>
<P>
   Hertz, 50, owes $45 million to four unidentified brokerage firms
to cover his losses in trading stocks, according to a news release
issued Monday by his company, Track Data Corp. To meet the brokers'
demand for him to put up more money, known as a margin call, he
pledged 25 million shares of his own company's stock out of about
45 million shares he owns. In a remarkable twist, Hertz has become
the most public victim yet of the kind of investing he was
promoting.
</P>
<P>
   Even after this week's rebound in stocks, some investors who
borrowed from their brokers to buy high-priced shares have not been
able to come up with additional cash to cover investments that had
fallen in value. This has alarmed Wall Street professionals and
others who worry that when stock markets that have only gone up
finally turn down, many people will be wiped out.
</P>
<P>
   But even in Friday's carnage, nobody expected that the chief
executive of an online trading company would be the one to generate
one of the biggest margin calls ever.
</P>
<P>
   Hertz declined through a colleague to be interviewed. ``This was
Mr. Hertz's personal account, his personal trading,'' said Rafi
Reguer, director of marketing at Track Data. ``It was done with
firms other than this one, in securities other than Track Data.''
Beyond that, Reguer declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Hertz is one of a new breed on Wall Street, people whose
backgrounds are in engineering and computer software rather than
finance, who believe that every individual investor should be able
to have Wall Street's trading action brought right into their
living rooms through a computer. According to the company, Hertz
earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Brooklyn College in
1971 and a master's degree in computer science from New York
University two years later.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Hertz, everyday investors who are MyTrack
customers star in its television ads, appearing on camera to give
testimonials to the system. And much of the company's Web site is
devoted to rave reviews from customers, even featuring pictures of
those who are happy using MyTrack.
</P>
<P>
   The company began offering online trading to customers last
June, charging $12.95 a trade and monthly fees of $20 to $95 for
access to quotes, news and other market data. About 100,000
investors have registered for the service. For a more sophisticated
system called MarkeTrack, customers pay $250 to $600 a month.
</P>
<P>
   News of Hertz's misfortune has cast a spotlight on the network
of companies he runs and is affiliated with. He founded the company
that would become Track Data in 1981, merged it with a data
provider called Global Market Information Inc. in March 1996 and
changed its name to Track Data. The company employs 375 people
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Hertz and his company issued new releases unceasingly. In
November, for example, the company issued 20 different news
releases, announcing developments like its offer of a week of
commission-free trading for its customers in celebration of the
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 17, Hertz made waves when Track Data put out a news
release announcing that the company had no news to report that day.
``Commenting on the lack of news today,'' the release said, ``Barry
Hertz, chairman and CEO said, `I want to apologize to our faithful
stockholders who are looking each morning for our latest corporate
developments. Rest assured that we do not take this lack of news
lightly.'''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Following the lead of many companies who split their stocks to
attract new investors, Track Data split its stock 2 for 1 twice
last fall. At its peak in January, Track Data had a market value of
almost $780 million; Hertz's 71.7 percent stake was worth about
$560 million. The company's shares, which traded as high as $12.25
just more than two months ago, closed Tuesday at $2.03125.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who buy and sell stocks on MyTrack have most of their
trades executed by Track Securities Corp., which in turn pays Track
Data for the orders.
</P>
<P>
   Track Securities, which is based in Boca Raton, Fla., has had a
number of run-ins with regulators in recent months. Last Thursday,
the securities regulator in Connecticut found that the firm had
been operating in the state without being registered and had
employed unregistered agents. It fined Track Securities $25,000.
And last August, New Mexico's securities regulator censured the
firm and fined it $10,670 for filing a misleading document and for
conducting activity in the state without a license. Florida
regulators also fined the firm $2,500 in August for not registering
a branch office and failing to establish and maintain adequate
supervisory procedures.
</P>
<P>
   According to Track Data's spokesman, Track Securities is owned
and run by Jack Spiegelman, a director of Track Data. But according
to a filing Track Securities made with securities regulators, Hertz
appears to be a close affiliate of the brokerage firm. In that
filing, Hertz is listed as president and chief executive of Track
Data Securities, owning between half and three-quarters of the
concern. Track Data Securities, according to this filing, is
controlled by Track Securities.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even after meeting his $45 million margin call, Hertz remains a
man of means. He will be left with roughly 20 million shares of
Track Data, worth about $40 million. And as chairman and co-founder
of Innodata Corp., a publicly traded company that allows its
customers to create and disseminate information online, he owns
14.7 percent of the company, worth $4.6 million at Tuesday's
closing price of $6.1875.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his salary of $375,000 at Track Data, Hertz
earned $75,000 last year for his work at Innodata, based in
Hackensack, N.J. The company went public in 1993 in an offering
underwritten by A.S. Goldmen, a small brokerage firm that was
indicted last July by the Manhattan district attorney on charges
that the firm orchestrated a securities fraud that cost investors
$100 million in losses. The firm closed most of its operations in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Even before news of Hertz's margin call hit Wall Street, Track
Data announced that it had retained an investment bank to advise it
on strategic options, including a possible sale of the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company is going to make the decision which is really the
best thing for the company,'' said Jay Gelman, senior vice
president of sales at Track Data. ``We will look at all the viable
offers and mergers and try to make the best determination.'' &QL;

PHOENIX: DIVERSITY BLOOMS IN THE DESERT
</HEADLINE>
  (BRYAN MILLER, a former restaurant critic for The Times, is
co-author with the late Pierre Franey of ``Cooking With the
60-Minute Gourmet'' (Times Books). 
 (For release Sunday, April 23.) 
By BRYAN MILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX, Ariz. _ Ten years ago, fine dining in Phoenix was
largely confined to chain restaurants, most of them in frosty
air-conditioned malls.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from a batch of scorching Tex-Mex chili parlors, the food
in this shimmering city in the sand was as flat as a bus ride to
Yuma. Or as one local culinary writer put it, ``Back then, people
here thought free-range chicken was something you didn't have to
pay for.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last five years, the Phoenix restaurant scene has grown
geometrically. Thai, Japanese, regional American, Asian _ all can
be found if you can navigate the exasperating circuitry of roads
that stitch together this metropolis of more than 3 million
inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   A few things to remember before heading out to dine in Phoenix:
Restaurants have conventional street numbers, but they are merely
decorative; every location here is identified by intersections. And
once the proper intersection is found, you have to locate the
correct corner (northwest, southeast, etc.); then find the correct
mall (everything is in a mall).
</P>
<P>
   But don't celebrate yet _ restaurants here are masters of
camouflage. One may be disguised as an annex to a shoe store,
another may skulk behind a faux hacienda courtyard encircled by
leafy palms.
</P>
<P>
   Also keep in mind that Phoenicians roll up their knapsacks
early. Lunch kicks off around 11, and dinner usually runs from 5:30
to 9 p.m. A few places whoop it up until 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Los Dos Molinos
</P>
<P>
   If spicy food makes your blood run hot, then Phoenix can give
you desert fever. Arizonans bluster about different chili peppers
the way Yankees fans track batting averages. And the lodestone for
leather tongues is Los Dos Molinos, which occupies a stucco and
terra-cotta hacienda that used to be the home of the Hollywood
cowboy star Tom Mix.
</P>
<P>
   Early on a Saturday evening, we had to cool our heels for nearly
two hours in a pleasant little outdoor courtyard where jalapeno
junkies were chilling down with aquarium-size margaritas. (The
restaurant does not accept reservations; weekdays are much calmer).
</P>
<P>
   Los Dos Molinos specializes in Santa Fe cooking _ which, as far
as I can tell, is identical to other Mexican-style fare except that
the peppers are a lot hotter. Portions here could feed a posse, so
it is advisable to start off slowly with some of the chunky,
vinegar-tinged guacamole (excellent) and various salsas (``hot''
``really hot'' and ``find a garden hose'').
</P>
<P>
   The menu warns of things to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry, we do not provide a mild sauce,'' says Victoria
Chavez, the chef and owner. ``I do not know how to make mild.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's vivacious daughter Cheryl chaperons the nightly fiesta
in the small dining room that resembles a Tex-Mex frat house, a
riot of dangling chilies, western art, mounted license plates and
neon beer signs. A strolling guitarist works the room with a
repertory that runs from ``Guantanamera'' to Van Morrison's
``Brown-Eyed Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   There are about eight house specialties, and you can get them as
hot as you like (we didn't push the envelope). Adovada ribs were my
favorite _ big, meaty monsters stoked with plenty of hot chilies,
but not excessively so, and flanked by well-seasoned red beans and
rice. Shrimp Veracruz climbed a notch higher on the spice meter,
six charred shrimp that had been massaged with red chili sauce and
served with the same side dishes.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the heat here so special is that it sneaks up behind
you like a bandito in the night. It first intensifies on the back
of the tongue, then leaves you all warm inside, while inferior hot
food only sears your lips.
</P>
<P>
   Other recommendations are the enchilada dinner (blue or yellow
tortillas and chilies covered with cheese and crowned with fried
eggs), and the smoldering flautas filled with shredded beef.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the weekend Pamplona here, the young, denim-clad
servers here seem to be having as much fun as the customers.
</P>
<P>
   For dessert, most diners get another drink _ the restaurant has
a great beer list _ but if you want something sweet, try the
sopaipillas, lasagna-shaped fried dough that is dusted with
cinnamon and drizzled with honey. Don't even think about asking for
wine.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Gregory's Grill
</P>
<P>
   For less bellicose fare there is this smart, welcoming spot
owned by 35-year-old Gregory Casale, the chef, and his wife, Kim.
Tucked into a shopping mall _ where else? _ its plain decor belies
some creative and compelling cooking, at very reasonable prices.
</P>
<P>
   Casale logged time at the River Cafe in New York as well as some
major hotels in Phoenix before venturing out on his own. His menu
traipses around the world, and for the most part it is a diverting
ride.
</P>
<P>
   We started with five-spice quail, the chef's twist on Peking
duck, that was nicely burnished and crisp _ though a tad dry _ and
nested on a cluster of mixed greens and homemade ginger chutney.
</P>
<P>
   A big bowl of meaty mussels vindaloo in a fiery
red-mustard-and-curry broth was bold and complex. One of the better
appetizers was sweetbreads in a brittle carapace of ground
hazelnuts served over a creamy risotto studded with peas.
</P>
<P>
   All of the main courses sampled were good, especially the
succulent braised beef short ribs in a sherry-spiked broth along
with horseradish mashed potatoes. Seared, peppery mahi-mahi was
deftly cooked and came with a flavorful crawfish spoonbread (a
great combination) and tasty succotash.
</P>
<P>
   The spiced sea bass was relatively tame _ a jab rather than a
punch _ and had a lively supporting cast of black rice in a peppery
curry broth, and Chinese long beans tossed with cashews.
</P>
<P>
   Our delightful and knowledgeable waitress recommended a host of
desserts, all of which where satisfying, especially the tower of
won ton crisps layered with lemon ice cream and ringed by a
semisweet pinot noir reduction.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory's Grill does not serve alcohol but you can bring your
own wine. (Although, in this circumstance, I don't think they
should charge an $8 corkage fee, or $4 for a Pilsener glass for
beer).
</P>
<P>
   Hapa
</P>
<P>
   This two-year-old restaurant is one of the most inventive and
exhilarating in Phoenix, and it is destined to enjoy a wider
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   It is owned by James McDevitt, who is of Japanese and Irish
ancestry (thus the name, which is Hawaiian slang for half) and his
wife, Stacey, the pastry chef. The menu is described as fusion, but
don't let that fatigued term scare you off.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there are two Hapas: a handsome sushi bar on one side
and, on the other, an airy Japanese-style dining room with an open
kitchen. I decided to try the sushi bar first (in fact, they do not
serve sushi, but rather sashimi-style dishes).
</P>
<P>
   Nobu Fukuda, the chatty and informative chef, started me off
with a wonderful appetizer of sliced raw halibut in a lustrous
sauce combining citrus juice, soy, sesame seeds and toasted garlic.
</P>
<P>
   It was so good that I got carried away and hurtled through a
half-dozen more dishes, including meaty slices of jumbo clam in a
tart sauce of green tea, sea salt and yuzu juice (citrus juice and
minced hot chilies), and thinly sliced poached duck with a gingered
soy-and-red-wine reduction. Exquisitely fresh sea urchins are so
oceanic they should be eaten in a bathing suit.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, specific wines are recommended for each dish; for
example, a tart, acidic Sancerre with the lemony clam dish. You
won't find many bargains on the limited regular wine list, but the
selections are smartly matched to the food.
</P>
<P>
   McDevitt (I stayed at the convivial sushi bar) took the helm
with some excellent crescent-shaped gingered-pork dumplings with a
curried mustard sauce and crunchy taro chips. Foie gras came
crisply seared and with a caramelized mango sauce, a lovely
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   His version of duck was just as appealing as the other, slices
of breast with a Vietnamese-style caramelized ginger sauce, along
with a cleansing cabbage slaw.
</P>
<P>
   Also recommended are the tender lamb chops flanked by charred
scallions and a lovely cashew couscous (another lamb chop entree
has them in a coriander crust and accompanied by a terrific
sweet-potato-ginger cake). A trio of fruit sorbets was the perfect
punctuation.
</P>
<P>
   Hapa is one of the few fine restaurants in town open on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Elaine's
</P>
<P>
   This is a luxurious, first-rate, staggeringly expensive
restaurant in the marmoreal Phoenician resort
</P>
<P>
   The recently arrived chef, James Boyce, has been around the
haute cuisine track, including a stint at Manhattan's Le Cirque. He
is passionate about ingredients, the type of fellow who can get
misty describing special beets from New Mexico. Boyce's cooking is
bright, inventive and as colorful as a desert sundown, yet doesn't
stray far from his classic French training.
</P>
<P>
   The dark, upholstered dining room _ it is so dark that diners
are supplied with little flashlights to read the menu _ offers a
panoramic view of the glittering city. And talk about service _
aside from offering every pampering side point, servers give all
women little footstools so they do not have to place their purses
on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   We started with remarkably sweet butter-braised lobster over
tart leaves of Swiss chard and crisp water chestnuts _ an ambrosial
combination.
</P>
<P>
   Perfectly made gnocchi are given regal treatment with flecks of
black truffles and toasted hazelnuts. I usually don't like people
fiddling with good oysters, but the chef's Belons under a gossamer
horseradish sauce retained their wonderful salinity.
</P>
<P>
   If you have just cleaned up on a high-stakes golf match, you
might try the incredibly buttery Kobe beef (at around $185,
depending on market prices). Or, for one-fourth of that, there is a
seductive chateaubriand of buffalo crowned with a perfectly cooked
slab of foie gras, served with a perfect bearnaise sauce. (Why do
we not see this astonishing sauce anymore?)
</P>
<P>
   Another sublime combination is braised halibut with chunks of
sweet lobster, cubes of thick bacon and basil.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Elaine's international wine list is well chosen, filled
with Bentleys and Jaguars; prices are fair, although I didn't
appreciate the sommelier's recommending a glass of ``nice white
wine'' that turned out to cost $25.
</P>
<P>
   Desserts, as one would expect, are lavish, like warm chocolate
souffle with mint ice cream, and steamed apple pudding with Cognac
sauce and macerated raisins.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's
</P>
<P>
   For a casual good time and better-than-average fare, there is
Richardson's, a large, adobelike spot with a big bar and lots of
big guys watching sports on an overhead television. Surprisingly,
though, some of the Tex-Mex fare is original and satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   You can start off with a nice array of mildly hot salsas, and a
good, but not great, guacamole. Posole, a smoky combination of pork
and hominy in a hot chili broth, is a lovely, warming dish.
</P>
<P>
   For $17, you can't beat the full-flavored Black Angus steak,
cooked to order, with a weird but appealing peppered whiskey lime
sauce, served over grilled portobello mushroom slices with pecans.
This is not the easiest dish to pair with wine, but there is a nice
little selection, mostly Californian and at very moderate prices.
</P>
<P>
   Another fine main course is grilled pork tenderloin that is
basted with a green-and-red chili jelly, and served with a green
chili potato. Our spunky and accommodating waitress went on and on
about this green chili potato (``You gotta try it''), a house
specialty. It may have been the potato chef's night off, but ours
were bland and greasy.
</P>
<P>
   For dessert, there is flan and flan. It's pretty good. &UR;  &LR;

HOPI VILLAGES ON THE MESAS: WHERE ARTISANS WORK WITH ANCIENT
DESIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release on Sunday, April 23) 
By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was not yet noon, but the thermometer in our rented sport
utility vehicle showed it was 102 degrees outside when my friend
Georgia and I arrived at the top of First Mesa, a
forbidding-looking plateau of rock in the northeastern Arizona
desert and a thriving traditional center of Hopi Indian life.
</P>
<P>
   Our guide, Lela, whom we had met at the village visitors center,
carried an umbrella against the fierce summer sun. She led us past
vendors of pottery and carved kachina dolls to Walpi, on a bony
rock claw jutting out over the desert that stretched beneath us for
hundreds of miles.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Hopi, she talked proudly but protectively about the
tribe's traditions. When we asked her to explain the nature of the
religious activities that took place in the underground ceremonial
rooms known as kivas, which dot the village, she smiled pleasantly
but said no. Her tone suggested we should leave it at that.
</P>
<P>
   According to legend, the Hopis' ancestors first entered the
world through a hollow reed at a sacred place near a river junction
in the Grand Canyon. They would emerge to wander the earth, but
eventually unite at a mythic sacred circle at the center of the
universe.
</P>
<P>
   That place, at least in the temporal world, is the Hopi
Reservation in northeastern Arizona. Here atop three majestic
promontories that dominate the surrounding desert are the Hopi
villages of the First, Second and Third Mesas, and a culture
closely bound to a spiritual identity dating back a millennium.
</P>
<P>
   We spent four days in July in the high desert exploring the mesa
villages. Our vacation schedules had forced us to visit the region
during one of the hottest months of the year. Doing so, however,
meant we escaped the crowds of spring and fall. We even found the
heat bearable. Temperatures changed rapidly. Sudden downpours had
us reaching for our windbreakers as the thermometer dropped 20
degrees or more within minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Our trip began and ended in Flagstaff, which is northeastern
Arizona's commercial and cultural hub, within easy reach of the
Grand Canyon, Monument Valley and the red-rock country of Sedona to
the south.
</P>
<P>
   There are many chain motels in the area, but we stayed downtown
at the Monte Vista Hotel, a funky, casual spot that captures the
1930's, when its movie star guests filmed westerns at nearby sites.
And although we had rented a four-wheel-drive vehicle at the
airport, we found we did not need the off-road capability because
we almost never left paved roads. From Flagstaff we drove east on
Interstate 40, the main east-west Interstate through Arizona, then
turned north on State Highway 87, through the Painted Desert, to
reach the villages _ a 170-mile drive.
</P>
<P>
   Later, we headed farther north on Highway 191 to Chinle, a
Navajo settlement nearest the glorious red-rock chasm of Canyon de
Chelly, whose alcoves hold excellently preserved stone ruins of the
Anasazi, the ancient forebears of the Hopi. Along the way we
shopped for pottery, baskets and rugs made by native craftsmen _
stopping at some of the many trading posts or, better, visiting
with the artists in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   We found a lot to see around Flagstaff itself. The Lowell
Observatory, where Pluto was discovered in 1930, is about a mile
west of downtown. It was founded on Mars Hill in the 1890s by the
mathematician Percival Lowell. The landscaped grounds provided a
tour of the region's flora. On some evenings, visitors can also
peer through one of the observatory's telescopes.
</P>
<P>
   About 35 miles east of Flagstaff on I-40 is Meteor Crater, a
4,100-foot-wide, 570-foot-deep hole in an otherwise flat desert
floor. The crater was formed 49,000 years ago when a huge iron and
nickel meteor smashed into the earth.
</P>
<P>
   A three-mile drive north of downtown, on North Fort Valley Road,
is the Museum of Northern Arizona, housed in a lovely building of
native flagstone with a red-tiled roof that sits in a ponderosa
pine forest. As first-time visitors, we found it a perfect starting
point for an overview of the region's natural history and native
cultures.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's best exhibits trace the evolution of the area's
native peoples, their history and crafts, both ancient and
contemporary. The pottery collection, in particular, showed us the
dazzling artistry of the native potters and how they have
incorporated ancient designs and construction techniques into their
work.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s, the museum's founders, Harold S. Colton and his
wife, Mary-Russell Ferrell Colton, helped revive the production of
native crafts on the Hopi mesas. The museum continues to support
such work through its displays, shops and Heritage Program _ art
marketplaces held on weekends from May through September that
feature the work of Hispanic, Hopi, Navajo, Zuni and Pai craftsmen.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's shops sell fine pottery, along with exceptional
hand-woven baskets, rugs and jewelry. Prices for the best work can
be daunting. A five-inch seed pot by the best Hopi potters can sell
for several hundred dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Prices are somewhat lower on the mesas. We found that a
traditional approach to shopping for pottery _ visiting the homes
of the artisans _ offered a revealing glimpse into the lives of the
Hopi and a rewarding introduction to their work. (Appointments are
generally not necessary.)
</P>
<P>
   For a treat, we spent a night at a refurbished railroad hotel,
La Posada, in Winslow, east of Flagstaff on I-40. The hotel was
designed by Mary Colter, the well-known Southwest architect who
incorporated native motifs in buildings along the route of the
Santa Fe Railway like La Posada. The hotel opened in 1930 and some
of Colter's admirers regard it as a masterpiece of railway
architecture. Today's owners have kept faith with her work, even
using dishes with native designs that she created for Santa Fe's
luxury train, the Super Chief.

 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
PHOENIX _ There were so many gifts that Charles Barkley said he has
been given. With his final night on an NBA court a day away, he
thought of the first 16 years and all it brought him.
<TEXT>
<P>
   He gives thanks every night, he said, for the joys, the fame,
the money. He has met presidents and kings. Nothing, even the
championship he will leave the game without, could make his life
richer.
</P>
<P>
   But tonight at Compaq Center the Rockets will try.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley was cleared to play the final game of his unique and
spectacular career tonight, giving him the chance to leave the
game, if not on top, upright and celebrated. His career was
declared over when he ruptured his left quadriceps tendon Dec. 8 in
Philadelphia. But when his rehabilitation went faster than
expected, he said he wanted only to be able to enjoy a few final
moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody has had a better life than me,'' Barkley
said. ``People talk about how I didn't win a championship. I don't
see a championship making my life any better. I pray every night,
and I say, `I don't know why you chose me, but thank you.' My life,
I feel like, is unbelievable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the Rockets nobody owes me anything: `I think you have
taken care of me long enough.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they're going to have a Charles Barkley lookalike
contest and they're going to show a video. I told them that's the
most I want them to do. Nobody owes me anything. I owe you guys
everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basketball doesn't owe me anything. I owe everything in my
life to basketball, everything. I'm 37 years old. I'm rich beyond
my wildest dreams. I have great material things. I've been all over
the world, and it's all because of basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockets have prevailed upon Barkley to allow a postgame
tribute tonight. There will be a halftime lookalike contest. Fans
will be given Barkley placards and face fans to provide a festive
feeling. A video the Rockets produced celebrating Barkley's career
will be shown.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, the I Am the Warrior video, the first NBA
Entertainment music video, will be shown. Barkley's family and
teammates will be brought back to the floor. The Grizzlies,
including former teammates Othella Harrington, Michael Dickerson
and Brent Price, will be invited to join them.
</P>
<P>
   Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich, vice president Carroll Dawson
and several teammates will speak. Rockets teammates and the
organization will present gifts.
</P>
<P>
   But Barkley said the greatest gift he could receive tonight is
just the chance to play. He had hoped to play about 10 minutes
Tuesday night in Phoenix. But there was concern that even a brief
appearance in Phoenix could keep him from playing in Houston and
could diminish his farewell game.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley said his leg was about 70 percent of its previous
strength and that he will be limited in what he would even try to
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to do anything stupid,'' he said. ``My friends
think I'm nuts. But they understand it's a big deal to me. I don't
want my last memory to be getting carried off a basketball court.
It's that simple. I can't go out and do anything crazy. The last
thing I want to do is hurt myself and have to rehab again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just something I need to do, to play my last game and
walk off the court. I don't have anything to prove. It's been a
great 16 years. You have to understand what it would mean for me
just to play a little bit. A basket would be nice. But
psychologically, it would be a great thing for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be very special. I have my mom and grandma and about
20 of my really good friends coming in tomorrow. I want them to be
there. They're all excited. I've got the bigwigs at Nike coming in.
I've got great friends from all over the country. It's going to be
a great night.''

 UNDATED: Super Chief.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1997, Allan Affeldt, a Southern California entrepreneur with
an interest in architectural preservation and ecology, bought the
hotel and began restoring it. Although its original furnishings
were sold and parts of the hotel were stripped of other original
decor, Affeldt and his crew have recently acquired some of the
original pieces and are reproducing some of the tinwork,
animal-shaped tables and monks' chairs based on old photographs. He
has now reopened 20 of the original 75 rooms as well as several
public areas to guests.
</P>
<P>
   North of Winslow, we drove a blacktop road up to the edge of
First Mesa. From there we could see far below the dry-farmed fields
sprouting corn, a crop at the heart of Hopi culture, ceremony and
religion. Hopi dry farming is an ancient agricultural system in
which the crop is grown without irrigation in fields so dry they
are scarcely distinguishable from the desert.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, the parched lowlands were streaked with the
brown, pink and purple sands of Painted Desert country. To the
southwest the dark shoulders of the San Francisco Mountains near
Flagstaff were visible. Hopi myth holds that those mountains are
the home of the kachinas, the Hopi ancestor deities.
</P>
<P>
   Modern-day kachinas, male dancers representing such deities,
arrive periodically in the villages wearing masks and costumes to
bring rain, or celebrate the harvest. Only some ceremonies are open
to visitors, and photographs are not allowed at all on the mesas.
</P>
<P>
   The dusty villages with their one-story mud and stone buildings
are striking in part because they are not the make-believe work of
theme park developers. They are real, and some date back hundreds
of years. Perched high over the desert, they resonate with the
activity of everyday life in a vibrant matriarchal society
organized into highly evolved clans.
</P>
<P>
   First Mesa, and the village of Polacca at its base, is a center
of Hopi pottery making. It is the home of the late Nampeyo, a
famous matriarch of a family of potters, whose work is still on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   We stopped to see Alice Dashee, a traditional Hopi potter. She
met us at her front door and showed us the few pieces that she had
for sale, beautifully shaped bowls and plates. In a wheelbarrow in
a corner was the clay she had dug from the desert rock. Sitting in
her living room, Dashee described how she shaped and rubbed the
pots smooth, working not with a wheel but from hand-coiled lengths
of clay. Using a chewed end of a native yucca stalk, she recreates
some of the 1,000-year-old Anasazi patterns unearthed in
archaeological digs. The pots are fired in outdoor bonfires using
dried sheep manure as fuel, which produces the high firing
temperatures necessary to give the ceramic work its rich orange
blush.
</P>
<P>
   At Second Mesa, about eight miles west of First Mesa, the Hopi
tribe operates a motel and restaurant at the Hopi Cultural Center.
The rooms are modern and clean. The restaurant offers an American
menu along with traditional _ and bland _ native fare like piki
bread, paper-thin blue-corn tortillas and a thin stew of hominy and
lamb.
</P>
<P>
   At Third Mesa, several miles farther west, is the tiny village
of Old Oraibi, which the Hopi tribe says is the oldest continuously
inhabited town in what is now the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours northeast of the Hopi villages, in the heart of
Navajo country, is Canyon de Chelly (drive 56 miles east on U.S.
Highway 264, then 30 miles north of U.S. Highway 191 to Chinle), a
majestic red-rock split in the earth. Traditional Navajo dwellings,
the circular hogans, still stand among the willows and cottonwoods
of the sandy canyon floor.
</P>
<P>
   The canyon subdivides into three main branches, with side
canyons that reach more than 100 miles through rock cliffs rising
in some places more than 1,100 feet. Overlook drives on the south
and north rim provide views into a surprisingly lush valley of
peach orchards and cornfields far below. We took a six-wheel-truck
tour of the canyon floor led by a Navajo guide, who led us to some
of the finest Anasazi rock art and ruins in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   We stayed at Thunderbird Lodge, a comfortable motel with an
attached cafeteria that is one of the older lodging places within
minutes of the canyon. The lodge helped arrange our guided tour.
The Navajo tribe, which controls access to the canyon, prohibits
almost all unescorted trips to the canyon floor.
</P>
<P>
   About six miles from the National Park Service headquarters is
one of the canyon's best-known ruins, the White House. This well
preserved and accessible multistory complex is named for a white
plaster wall on one section; at one time it contained as many as 80
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the Hopi, the Navajo are relatively recent
arrivals to this part of Arizona, migrating to the canyon and
surrounding region sometime after 1400 with a language, culture and
history far different from the Hopi.
</P>
<P>
   The Navajo occupied lands left by the Anasazi, whose departure
is still incompletely explained. The Navajo barely touched the
empty ruins, according to some experts, because they feared the
abandoned rock houses as places of the dead.
</P>
<P>
   We left the canyon, driving back to Flagstaff through two of the
region's greatest visitor sites, Monument Valley and the Grand
Canyon, with their famous vistas swarming with crowds,
traffic-congested roads and tour buses. The drive had been a long
one, under a sometimes sizzling sun, but the native cultures and
high desert had exerted a magnetic influence over us, and we were
ready to go back _ even in summer.
</P>
<P>
   Getting There
</P>
<P>
   Flagstaff was a starting point for our trip. I flew America West
Airlines first to Phoenix from the Baltimore-Washington
International Airport and then aboard an America West Express
turboprop to Flagstaff. Reservations: (800) 235-9292. At the
airport, we rented a Chevrolet Blazer from Avis for a week for
$53.16 a day, not including fees, taxes and surcharges.

STOCKS ADVANCE STRONGLY, RECOVERING MUCH LOST GROUND

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With corporate earnings soaring, investors flooded
back into U.S. stocks Tuesday for the second consecutive day,
retracing much of the ground lost last week.
</P>
<P>
   Coming on the heels of Monday's gains, the rise put an end to
immediate fears that small investors are ready to abandon stocks.
Yet many Wall Street professionals remain wary that the market is
still overly expensive. Some warned that the current rally may
prove as ephemeral as the Nasdaq's bounce two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Tuesday's gains were impressive. The technology-rich
Nasdaq composite index rose 254.41 points, to 3,793.57. That 7.2
percent jump, coming on top of Monday's 6.6 percent rise, was the
Nasdaq's second-biggest gain ever _ behind only the 7.3 percent
increase on Oct. 21, 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average gained 184.91 points, or 1.8
percent, to end the day at 10,767.42, following a gain of 2.7
percent Monday.
</P>
<P>
   While both indexes remain well off their highs, the Nasdaq now
stands above its close Thursday and has regained almost half of
last week's scary 25 percent plunge, while the Dow has taken back
more than half its 7 percent loss from last week. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index also performed well, rising 40.17 points, or
2.9 percent, to close at 1,441.61
</P>
<P>
   Adding to investors' cheer, several important companies posted
first-quarter earnings well ahead of analysts' expectations. In the
technology sector, Intel and America Online, which reported
earnings after the market closed, both handily beat estimates by
the pros. Old-economy stocks also showed their strength, with drug
companies Pfizer and Johnson &AMP; Johnson both posting
higher-than-expected profits.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, several money managers and Wall Street strategists
pointed to signs that the rally may not last. While earnings are
growing fast, many technology stocks remain expensive, and the
market's unusually high volatility is worrisome, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to pull back from this,'' said Fred
Kobrick, a veteran money manager who invests almost $2 billion.
``People are doing this because they're afraid of missing the
upside, not because they see undervalued companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the weekend's warnings that individual investors might
be fleeing stocks have proven ludicrously wrong so far. Since
Monday afternoon, investors have bought stocks fiercely, especially
in the technology sector, sending bellwethers like Cisco Systems
and Intel up 15 percent or more. That is nearly a complete reversal
of last week, when investors sent the Nasdaq down 25 percent,
including nearly 10 percent on Friday alone, on fears that
technology stocks were overpriced and higher interest rates would
slow earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Callies, chief U.S. market strategist for Credit
Suisse First Boston, warned against reading too much into this
week's gains. ``This is pretty standard stuff for a market that
went down 35 percent,'' she said. ``The harder they fall, the
faster they bounce.''
</P>
<P>
   The more relevant question, Callies said, is what happens next.
She said that the Nasdaq could hit 4,160, a gain of about 10
percent above its current level, but that any rally would probably
not hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most market bottoms require several attempts,'' she said.
Callies also worries that investors could be underestimating the
risk that inflation is accelerating, which would force the Federal
Reserve to raise interest rates. Higher rates would slow the
economy and lower corporate profits, probably hurting the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``If core inflation proves to be higher than the market has
thought,'' she said, ``then the Fed is going to be in a very, very
delicate position for many months.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard E. Cripps, chief market strategist at Legg Mason in
Baltimore, said the Nasdaq rally was more a product of ``defensive
buying'' than of ``full conviction.'' Professional money managers,
he said, are just saying, ``I can't afford to miss this.''
</P>
<P>
   Cripps added that he would ``be surprised if this is an up leg
that carries us back to the old highs.'' In the weeks ahead, he
said, the Nasdaq could even fall below the low it set Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But Jeffrey M. Warantz, equity strategist at Salomon Smith
Barney, said the details of yesterday's rally offered investors
some reason for optimism. The rally was broadly based, unlike
Monday's gains, which were confined mostly to the largest stocks.
The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks was up a sharp 6
percent Tuesday, compared with a gain of just 1.2 percent on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Warantz said he wished stocks would settle down.
Investors may be pleased with their gains this week, but unless the
market calms, he said, ``we could turn around and have another
400-point down day.''
</P>
<P>
   A look at the biggest winners this week offers proof of just how
quickly investors have turned back to their technology favorites.
Four of the 10 best performers in the Nasdaq 100 index, made up the
largest companies in the Nasdaq composite, were among the 10 worst
performers last week.
</P>
<P>
   The four winners: Applied Micro Circuits, which makes
high-bandwidth products, up $2.625 Tuesday, to $107.25, and 50
percent in the last two days; Echostar, which operates a satellite
television service, up $6.4375 Tuesday, to $57.8125, and up 35
percent this week; Network Solutions, which provides Internet
domain registration services, up $27.625 yesterday, to $148.625,
and 40 percent this week; and Broadvision, a manufacturer of
e-commerce software, up $11.125 yesterday, to $38, and up 28
percent this week. Yet all are still below where they were before
last week's sell-off.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dow, the pattern is even more striking. Four of the 10
stocks that had the biggest declines last week were among the
leaders in the rebound on Monday and Tuesday, including General
Electric, Hewlett-Packard, Intel and Microsoft. But all four are
still below where they traded when the decline began. &QL;

A LOW-TECH PRESIDENT VISITS A HIGH-TECH SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ During a visit to the country's largest computer trade
show on Tuesday, President Clinton wore an ergonomic pillow around
his neck, fiddled with a pager that sends and receives electronic
mail and examined a Web site that a computer expert told him could
retrieve confidential files from the Oval Office while he was on
the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty neat, huh?'' Clinton said as he examined a pager made
by Motorola that doubled as a minicomputer. He held up the gadget
to the reporters trailing him through the exhibition floor and
remarked: ``Think of how much more damage the press corps could do
if you all had one of these.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will never be mistaken for a computer geek. He does not
send e-mail messages. He still speaks in awe of the idea of
ordering gifts over the Internet. And not too long ago, he raised
his eyes at a product as mundane as a screen saver.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his lack of expertise when it comes to the dot-com
world, Clinton has launched a tour aimed at bringing the digital
revolution to the country's computer have-nots. After stops on
Monday in a poor neighborhood near Silicon Valley and a Navajo
Indian reservation in New Mexico, Clinton took his message to the
thousands of Web designers, product developers, software
specialists and others at the Comdex/Spring 2000 computer trade
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here today to ask you to set another trend _ to devote
more time and technology, more ideas and energy, to closing the
digital divide,'' Clinton said in a speech.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I honestly believe that the new information economy
has the potential, at home and around the world, to lift more
people out of poverty more quickly than at any previous period in
all of human history _ and that tapping that potential is actually
in our enlightened self-interest.''
</P>
<P>
   During his tour of the exhibition hall, which had more than 500
booths, the president received a crash course in the next
generation of computing. He saw a voice-activated system to access
the Internet. He examined the latest wireless technology. He picked
up a cellular telephone specially made to accommodate men's larger
fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've given me hope, with my big awkward hands,'' said
Clinton, who passed along to aides the t-shirts, mugs and other
free items that he amassed.
</P>
<P>
   On the exhibition floor, there were digital fingerprint sensors,
personal computerized calorie counters and computer mouses that
double as telephones. At the exhibit set up by StoragePoint.com,
Clinton learned about a system that allowed travelers to access
information stored in their desktop computers. ``If you're on Air
Force One and you have an Internet connection, you can get your
files,'' said Lauren Brinner, the company's director of product
development.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton listened to her comments with mouth agape, but he shook
his head when Brinner told him that the system would even allow him
to store files that only he could access.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had enough problems,'' Clinton remarked, referring to
the dispute with Congress over thousands of White House e-mail
messages that were improperly stored in the administration's
database.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the items the president reviewed, the one that he seemed
to understand best was the most low-tech.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Kowal, a nurse and massage therapist who founded
motherearthpillows.com, placed a warm wrap around Clinton's
shoulders and extolled the virtues of her invention, which
increases circulation and oxygenation and diminishes tension and
exhaustion in the stressed professional.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be good for me, with my crazy lifestyle,'' Clinton
said, tucking a purple pillow under his arm after Kowal had given
it to him as a gift.

COMPANIES TRY REPRICING STOCK OPTIONS TO KEEP THE BEST AND
BRIGHTEST 
BY DAVID LEONHARDT  
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 11 months since it went public, Barnesandnoble.com has
followed a similar recruiting strategy to virtually every other
Internet start-up. To lure employees from secure jobs at solid
companies, it has handed out thousands of stock options that have
the potential to make an annual salary look like loose change.
</P>
<P>
   But based on the company's current stock price, which is about a
third of what it was in October, virtually all the options are
worth nothing. So at the end of February, the company resorted to a
strategy that was supposed to be extinct, thanks to a tough new
accounting rule: It repriced more than a third of its outstanding
options, cutting their exercise price to $8, from an average of
$16.
</P>
<P>
   The move will force Barnesandnoble to take a charge on its next
earnings statement, because of the accounting rule, and it opens up
the company to criticism from large investors who have long railed
against repricings as an unfair bailout. ``It does make for some
difficulties,'' said Marie Toulantis, the chief financial officer.
In the current labor market, however, the company had no choice but
to make the move, which applied only to midlevel managers and
lower-ranked employees, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, CDnow, another high-profile Internet retailer, also
repriced last month. MyTurn.com, a maker of low-cost computers,
announced a similar step in recent weeks. And Iomega, a
computer-storage company, has asked its shareholders to approve a
repricing plan. At other Internet companies, executives have been
running the numbers in recent weeks to decide if they too could
afford repricings, according to pay consultants and venture
capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   Repricing is only the most extreme example of the steps that
companies have taken in recent weeks as a downturn in technology
stocks has tarnished the gold standard in white-collar pay: stock
options. Many stocks continued to recover on Tuesday from last
week's sell-off, but for most public Internet companies, 2000 has
still been a nasty year on Wall Street. The Morgan Stanley Internet
index is down more than a third since early March.
</P>
<P>
   The result, analysts say, is the first significant challenge to
the notion that options are the most desirable form of pay in the
new economy. In response, companies are scrambling to solve morale
problems that many have never before faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``This market decline has exposed the dark underbelly of going
public,'' said Roger McNamee, a partner at Integral Capital
Partners. ``If you can't keep your team together, it's hard to make
a real company.''
</P>
<P>
   Some technology companies, including Microsoft, have recently
given employees unusually large option grants, in an effort to take
advantage of their low prices. Others are considering strategies,
such as granting restricted stock, that have until now been limited
to old-line companies with sagging share prices. More repricings
are likely as well, pay consultants said.
</P>
<P>
   And at dozens of companies, executives are meeting with
employees, both formally and in hallway conversations, trying to
reassure them that a drop in their company's stock price should not
cause them to leave for other concerns, where they could receive
options at the current, lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these employees joined largely because of the
perceived upside in the stock option value,'' said Jim Breyer, the
managing partner at Accel Partners, a venture capital firm in Palo
Alto, Calif. ``The public companies that have experienced pullbacks
in their stock are going to see significant employee turnover over
the next six months.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Mr. Breyer said, the number of resumes his firm
receives daily has more than quadrupled, to about 100, as employees
of many consumer dot-com companies have lost faith in the prospects
of their companies.
</P>
<P>
   For executives, the downturn presents a new type of management
conundrum. In years past, most employees barely noticed whether
their company's share price was up or down. Today, however, the
boom in stock options and the easy access to information have
combined with the most volatile stock market in history to create
headaches for managers at companies across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Alteon WebSystems, a manufacturer of Internet switches
based in San Jose, Calif. It went public in September at $19 a
share and by early December, the stock had zoomed to more than
$120. Over the next three months, it fell, rose again and then
started dropping precipitously, to close at $58 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   So the company's president, Dominic P. Orr, sent out a memo by
e-mail at the start of this month. ``I am sure all of you have been
perturbed in one way or the other'' by the recent decline, the memo
began. It went on to emphasize Alteon's strengths as an equipment
maker, as opposed to a consumer Web site, that will prosper so long
as Internet traffic continues rising. The memo ended with: ``DAMN
THE TORPEDOES ... FULL SPEED FORWARD!!!''
</P>
<P>
   But the stock kept falling, dropping below $60 during last
week's overall market decline. ``Everyone was kind of panicking
there for a minute,'' said Jolene Thomas, who works in Alteon's
information technology support department and checks the company's
stock price about four times a day. ``Everyone was just like, `Wow!
Did you see our stock? It's going down some more.'''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Alteon's top executives will meet with employees in
the company's cafeteria and explain that quarterly earnings, which
it will announce on Wednesday, are more important than the stock
price, said James Burke, the chief financial officer. If the stock
price stays well below its high for months to come, executives will
then consider other steps, including repricing, Burke said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to sit and wait and see what happens,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   That is the attitude most companies are taking, as executives
try to figure out how long the technology slump will last and what
the best response is. In recent weeks, many have called
compensation experts to discuss alternatives that range from making
large new option grants to the radical step of repricing.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies have already taken action. Microsoft, for
example, has given unusually large options grants in recent weeks,
as The Wall Street Journal reported this week. Because the
company's stock has fallen about one third since December, largely
in reaction to the antitrust case, many of the options that the
company had granted over the last year are now under water.
</P>
<P>
   Others are likely to offer employees the chance to exchange
their stock options for shares of restricted stock, pay consultants
said. If a company had granted options at $20, for example, and the
stock was now trading at $10, it could give employees outright
ownership of a smaller number of $10 shares in return for canceling
their $20 options. Even if the stock continued to fall below $10,
the restricted shares _ which workers can keep so long as they stay
with the company for a certain period of time _ would still have
value.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, such an exchange does not require companies to
take an earnings charge, according to the final version of the new
accounting rule released last month by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board.
</P>
<P>
   And, as Barnesandnoble.com and CDNow have shown, even that
earnings charge is not enough to dissuade all companies from
repricing their options when their stock price is falling and they
are facing a tight labor market. Of course, with many dot-com
companies continuing to post a loss and telling investors to watch
their operating income, the charge may seem less daunting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since they don't have earnings, they don't have to worry about
a hit to earnings,'' said Ira T. Kay, the head of the compensation
practice at Watson Wyatt Worldwide.

 &HT;    Intel's 1st quarter profits top forecasts
 &HT;    By Kirk Ladendorf
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Strong personal computer sales bolstered Intel
Corp.'s first-quarter earnings, which narrowly beat analysts'
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest chip maker reported net income of $2.7
billion, or 78 cents a share, on revenue of $8 billion. Revenue was
up 13 percent from the first quarter of 1999, while net income rose
37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   After excluding the cost of business acquisitions and excluding
17 cents a share in tax benefits, the company's operations earnings
of 71 cents a share topped the analysts' estimate of 69 cents a
share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Demand in the first quarter was stronger than we expected,''
said Intel Chief Executive Craig Barrett. ``We are accelerating our
investments in capacity to meet future demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel's strong results follow record sales and earnings by
competitor Advanced Micro Devices Inc., which posted its first
billion-dollar sales quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, which announced plans in March to build a major chip
design center in downtown Austin, has been under pressure from
personal computer makers to boost its shipments of high-performance
processors. Barrett said Intel's supply of processors will remain
tight in the second quarter, but the company's big investment in
new manufacturing capacity should translate into ample supplies in
the second half of the year when Intel will introduce two major new
processors, the Itanium and the chip code-named Willamette.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings were released after the market closed Intel shares
closed at $129 a share, up $6 in Nasdaq trading

MEDICAL EXPERTS DISAGREE ON POSSIBLE ABUSE TO BOY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Tuesday, with the political and judicial players
temporarily off-stage, the spotlight in the Elian Gonzalez drama
turned to dueling doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Irwin Redlener, a child-abuse expert and the government's
chief medical adviser on Elian, set off a vituperative debate with
a letter _ made public by federal authorities Monday _ in which he
called the Gonzalez household in Little Havana ``psychologically
abusive.'' He suggested that the government should act immediately
to return the boy to his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``The child needs to be rescued,'' Redlener added Tuesday on
NBC's ``Today'' show. He said he reached his conclusion over the
weekend, while watching the home video in which Elian insists to
his father that he wants to stay in this country.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban Pediatric Society in Exile, a 30-year-old organization
that describes itself as nonpolitical, responded with a
condemnation of Redlener's appraisal. Without mentioning his name,
the group said the doctor could not possibly understand Elian's
condition without having examined the boy himself _ which Redlener
acknowledged he had not done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We denounce and strongly oppose statements made by individuals
who have been expressing medical or psychological judgments without
following the most basic rules of medical ethics and care,'' Dr.
Jose Carro, the society's president-elect, said to reporters
outside the house in which Elian has been living since being
rescued off the coast of Florida last November.
</P>
<P>
   A short while after Carro spoke, US Rep. Lincoln Diaz Ballar
stepped up to the same bank of microphones and aimed even more
scathing language at Redlener, who is president of the Children's
Hospital at Montefiore in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``That psychiatrist is just a hatchet man for the Clinton
administration,'' said Diaz Ballar, a Republican who represents the
Miami area. He then implied that Redlener, who is not a
psychiatrist, had been improperly influenced by his government
employers in order to sway US public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder how much he was paid?'' the congressman asked.
</P>
<P>
   The general mood outside the Gonzalez home seemed decidedly less
combative Tuesday than it had a day earlier, when a potentially
critical decision by the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals seemed
imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, official concern remained high about how Cuban exiles and
their supporters will react if the government tries to take the
6-year-old refugee.
</P>
<P>
   Both political and community leaders in recent days have been
urging protesters in the Little Havana area of Miami to keep cool
heads and show the world that they can resolve this dispute
peacefully. Simultaneously, they have been asserting that, if
trouble does break out, it will be the fault of infiltrators loyal
to Cuban President Fidel Castro rather than of the people who stand
vigil every day to demand that Elian remain in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only is violence not an option, but whoever even threatens
violence is an agent of Castro,'' Diaz Ballar told the group
assembled here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the fallout, federal officials appear to be preparing
both the Cuban community and Americans in general for a
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last week, they have stripped Elian's great-uncle,
Lazaro Gonzalez, of legal custody over the boy and have dropped
broad hints that they are preparing to somehow gain control over
him. The Justice Department indicated it would take no action,
however, until the 11th Circuit renders its decision on Elian's
status.
</P>
<P>
   His relatives want the court to issue a permanent injunction
against the boy's leaving the country while any judicial action is
pending, while the government has asked for an order that Elian be
returned to his father immediately. A ruling could come at any
time.
</P>
<P>
   As if to show that Elian needs to be moved for mental-health as
well as legal or political reasons, the Immigration and
Naturalization Service late Monday gave reporters in Washington
copies of Redlener's letter, which was addressed to Attorney
General Janet Reno and INS Commissioner Doris Meissner. While
Elian's father and his lawyer have argued that it was not in the
child's best interest psychologically to remain in the Miami
relatives' home, the release of Redlener's assessment represented
the first time the government had publicly suggested that it
agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elian Gonzalez is now in a state of imminent danger to his
physical and emotional well-being in a home that I consider to be
psychologically abusive,'' wrote Redlener, who put together the
team of three mental-health specialists who met last week with
Lazaro Gonzalez and other members of his family. Elian did not
attend that meeting and was not examined by the doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Redlener, in his letter, expressed particular concern about the
home video the boy's relatives made and distributed to the media.
The pediatrician said the tape reminded him of a hostage video, and
explained Tuesday that he did not need to examine Elian personally
to come to that conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's relatives in Miami have been no less adamant in making
their case for keeping the boy in the United States than the
government has for reuniting him with his father, even if that
means he will live in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to forcefully rebutting Redlener, supporters of the
relatives Tuesday presented a 10-year-old Cuban girl to the media
here and said her case was very similar to Elian's. They said the
girl had been the lone survivor of a raft trip to this country
during which her mother had died.
</P>
<P>
   ``So why can she stay and Elian cannot?'' a Cuban woman asked
after bringing the girl to the cluster of microphones in front of
the Gonzalez home. Asked whether the girl's father also had
remained in Cuba, like Elian's father, the woman replied ``no'' and
said he had come to the United States earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubans' principal argument for keeping Elian in this country
is that their homeland is ruled by a despot who will deprive the
boy of freedom and will brainwash him if he returns. As tangible
evidence of how bad the Cuban government is, its critics pointed to
an incident in Washington several days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Several men reportedly emerged from the Cuban diplomatic mission
Friday evening and beat up a group of Cuban-American demonstrators
who were supportin Elian. Some of the protesters were treated for
minor injuries in local hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   District of Columbia police said they had begun an investigation
into the alleged attack. And the State Department summoned a top
Cuban diplomat to express ``extreme concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Luis Fernandez, a spokesman for the mission, would not comment
on the allegations but told the Associated Press that the
protesters had been ``performing provocative actions against the
integrity and dignity of our diplomatic mission, disrupting its
normal functions.''

2 KILLED IN MICHIGAN AT HIGH-RISE FOR ELDERLY  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN PARK, Mich. _ A former country music singer shot and
killed two women Tuesday and wounded another person after he was
accused of sexual harassment and verbal abuse in a meeting with the
authorities at a public housing high-rise for the elderly, the
police said.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings came just minutes after housing officials at the
Lincoln Park Seniors Tower confronted the accused gunman, Kenneth
R. Miller, about his neighbors' accusations, said his son, Kenneth
Miller Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Miller said his father, 56, had been battling
depression and ``taking pills for his nerves.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller was arrested four hours after barricading himself in
another tenant's apartment with a .22-caliber rifle after the
shootings, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln Park is about 15 minutes south of downtown Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   One of the victims was identified as Marilyn Higgins, 64, a city
housing commissioner, who was making her weekly delivery of
cookies, cakes and breads to the building's 110 tenants, said
Thomas Baize, president of the Lincoln Park Housing Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The other victims were not immediately identified.

 &HT;    Lady Dogs hope to recapture '94 magic
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ The parallels with the 1994 season are uncanny.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since that magical season, when Georgia's
women's tennis team won its first and only national championship,
the No. 3-ranked Lady Bulldogs (19-1, 11-0 SEC) have beaten
longtime nemesis Florida, gone unbeaten in SEC play and won the
conference's regular-season title. Now they set their sights on the
SEC Tournament, which begins Thursday in Oxford, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   As league champion, Georgia has a first-round bye and is assured
of a high seed in the NCAA Tournament. But the Lady Bulldogs insist
they won't mail it in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some goals left,'' coach Jeff Wallace said. ``We
reached one by winning the SEC, but now we focus on winning the SEC
Tournament, getting a good seed in the NCAAs and winning the
national championship. We have a lot of tennis left to play.''
</P>
<P>
   That the Bulldogs have been able to put themselves in this
position this year is a testament to the team's fortitude and
versatility.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Marissa Catlin, ranked No. 1 in the nation as a sophomore
two years ago, entered the season with considerable uncertainty
surrounding an injured knee that required offseason surgery and
kept her sidelined this fall. As a result, Catlin plummeted in the
rankings. She enters the tournament ranked 53rd nationally despite
her 11-0 record at No. 3 singles this year.
</P>
<P>
   But while Catlin's game suffered a temporary setback _ Wallace
said she's playing as well as ever now _ her teammates have been
able to elevate their play.
</P>
<P>
   Junior Aarthi Venkatesan, who bounced between No. 2 and No. 3
singles the past two seasons, has flourished in Catlin's former No.
1 position. She's 12-3 this year and 22-7 in dual-match play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you play 1 or 6 or you're the eighth player, everyone
on this team knows they have a role to play,'' said Venkatesan.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia snapped Florida's streak of 65 SEC regular-season wins
in a row with a 5-2 victory last week. The Lady Dogs' only loss
this season was to No. 1-ranked Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace's achievements in 15 years as Georgia's coach have begun
to pile up. Only two other coaches in the nation _ Florida's Andy
Brandi and Stanford's Frank Brennan _ have won at a better rate
than Wallace, whose teams have won 327 of their 407 matches (.803)
during his tenure. He's twice been named national coach of the
year, four times earned SEC coach of the year honors and led
Georgia to four SEC titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, it isn't about me,'' said Wallace, 36, from
Portland, Ore. ``Championships are won by teams that don't mind
taking responsibility for doing what it takes to be in that
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what this team has done.''

REPUBLICANS CRITICIZE CLINTON OVER REFUSING ARMS SALES TO TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
 By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Leading Republican lawmakers accused the Clinton
administration on Tuesday of caving in to pressure from China by
refusing to sell high-tech destroyers and other advanced weapons to
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, said the
administration's decision to bar the sale of Aegis destroyers,
submarines and anti-submarine warfare aircraft to Taiwan was based
on ``threats emanating from Beijing,'' rather than on Taiwan's
legitimate defense needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration should worry more about protecting and
promoting Taiwan's democracy than offending the communist dictators
in Beijing,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   China has vigorously opposed Taiwan's latest shopping list,
especially its request for four Arleigh Burke-class destroyers with
sophisticated radar and antimissile systems costing more than $1.5
billion each.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's supporters in Congress have lobbied hard for the
transfer.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials insisted that the proposed arms
package, which will provide Taiwan with new defensive capabilities
in early warning radar and other areas, was calibrated to address a
mounting threat from China without overly antagonizing Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made it very clear to the PRC that because we, under the
law, help Taiwan respond to defensive needs, the greater the threat
posed by China, the greater Taiwan's defensive needs will be,''
said Kenneth H. Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman, referring to the
People's Republic.
</P>
<P>
   He called ``on both sides to show restraint, particularly on the
Chinese.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lott warned that China's leaders might construe the limited
weapons package as a ``green light for further threats against
Taiwan,'' which Beijing views as a renegade province.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a tragic miscalculation were Beijing to
underestimate the resolve of the American people to defend
Taiwan,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   But the majority leader did not signal further legislative
action to help Taiwan. He has not yet scheduled a vote on the
Taiwan Security Enhancement Act, a bill that would upgrade military
ties between the United States and Taiwan, including the
establishment of direct contact between their armed forces and
American training of Taiwanese officers.
</P>
<P>
   The House overwhelmingly approved the bill on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jesse Helms, the chairman of the Foreign Relations
Committee, said the administration left Taiwan's supporters in the
Senate no choice but to press for swift approval of the Taiwan
Security Enhancement Act. Beijing has warned that passage of the
act would bring ``very serious damage'' to U.S.-Chinese relations,
and the White House has threatened to veto it.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear, however, if the bill would pass the Senate,
which is poised to approve legislation next month to grant Beijing
the status of normal trading relations with the United States and
help ease China's entry into the World Trade Organization.

GRAND JURY FINDS NO CRIME IN SHOOTING OF FELLOW OFFICER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE AND JAMAL L. WATSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ After a two-month probe into a racially
charged shooting that spurred hundreds of protesters to descend on
City Hall, a grand jury has decided not to charge two white
Providence police officers who killed a black off-duty officer they
apparently mistook for an armed suspect.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's decision Tuesday not to indict Officers Carlos
Saraiva and Michael Solitro III, who fired at least six shots at
Sergeant Cornel Young Jr. during a late-night fracas Jan. 28,
rekindled some of the outrage that erupted in the minority
community after Young's death.
</P>
<P>
   In a related development, Attorney General Sheldon Whitehouse
announced that the state would not prosecute a felony murder charge
against Aldrin Diaz, an armed man who was confronted by police
outside Fidas Restaurant moments before they shot Young.
</P>
<P>
   Young, dressed in civilian clothes, had stopped at Fidas for a
late-night snack, but rushed outside with his pistol drawn to help
his fellow officers confront Diaz in the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Young's parents, who are divorced, did not comment about the
grand jury decision. A man who identified himself as the officer's
stepfather said by telephone that he was too angry to react
publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Providence police Major Cornel Young Sr., Sergeant Young's
father and the highest-ranking black officer in the department,
also declined an interview. ``Now is not the time to talk,'' said
Young, who appeared shaken when he answered the door at his South
Providence home. ``I can't talk now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The people we have coming here are very, very upset,'' said
the Rev. Marlowe V.N. Washington from the Allen A.M.E Church in
South Providence, where Young's father worships. Community leaders
met at his church to discuss the verdict and plan their strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision is not a surprise,'' Washington said. ``We
expected it; we knew it was coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitehouse urged calm Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be people who may or may not agree with the
decisions announced here,'' Whitehouse said. ``But no one in this
world knows more about what happened that night than the
investigators, prosecutors, and members of the grand jury who heard
so much evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call on all communities in Rhode Island whatever their
opinions about (Tuesday's) announcements to be calm, to be
responsible, and to continue to fight in appropriate channels.''
</P>
<P>
   His appeal was echoed by Mayor Vincent A. Cianci Jr. At a City
Hall news conference, Cianci urged that activists not ``exploit''
the grand jury action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have accepted their decision, and hope and pray that the
community does as well,'' Cianci said. ``This is time for calm, for
harmony and acceptance. And while we still mourn, this is time for
hope, hope that such a tragic occurrence will never repeat
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Police did not comment on the decision. Major Martin Hames, the
police spokesman, said it is now up to Saraiva and Solitro, who are
on leave, to choose whether they wish to return to the department.
</P>
<P>
   If they decide to resume active duty on the street, Hames said,
the department will ``make sure they're physically and mentally''
prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Joseph Pezza, who represents Solitro, said his client
acknowledged some people would always believe racism was a factor
in the officers' decison to shoot, despite the grand jury decision.
But Solitro is looking to the future, Pezza said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think now he wants to get on with things and try to get back
to a productive career,'' Pezza said. ``It's been his lifelong
dream to be a police officer.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Joseph Penza Jr., who represents Saraiva, said his
client was relieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can really appreciate the emotional situation he's been
through,'' Penza said. ``He was very happy because he held out hope
the whole time that truth would prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   But many in the community are skeptical that the grand jury
reached the proper decision.
</P>
<P>
   Those concerns were voiced by state Representative Joseph
Almeida, a former Providence police officer who co-founded the
state minority police association with Young's father.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community is upset,'' Almeida said. ``And because the
attorney general chose this route, we'll never know what went
before the grand jury,'' whose proceedings are secret.
</P>
<P>
   Minority activists have also questioned the influence on the
grand jury of a special investigative team named by Whitehouse to
present evidence to the panel. Six of the nine law officers
appointed to that group are Providence police.
</P>
<P>
   Whitehouse said the grand jury heard more than 50 witnesses and
reviewed approximately 100 documents and exhibits produced by the
two-month investigation.
</P>
<P>
   After announcing the grand jury's decision, Whitehouse said the
state decided not to prosecute Diaz on a felony murder charge for
Young's death. Police had lodged that charge against Diaz, alleging
he was responsible for creating the chaotic circumstances that led
to Young's shooting, even though he dropped his weapon before
Saraiva and Solitro opened fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I believe it was a close call,'' Whitehouse said, ``I
reached the conclusion that a charge of felony murder against Mr.
Diaz would not be supportable under the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Whitehouse said, the state will charge Diaz with two
counts of assault with a dangerous weapon and one count of
possession of a pistol without a license.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a Superior Court judge sentenced Diaz to 12 years in
prison for a weapon-related probation violation stemming from the
fracas.
</P>
<P>
   Minority leaders have called Diaz, 30, a scapegoat for what they
believe was a fatal example of racial profiling. Racial profiling
is the term used by critics who believe police often suspect
criminal behavior based solely on a person's race.
</P>
<P>
   John H. Cunha Jr., Diaz's attorney, said he is pleased his
client will not face a murder charge, but ``we're disappointed that
(Whitehouse) is determined to pursue the lesser charges against Mr.
Diaz.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very much concerned and hope that they're not trying to
use these charges to punish Diaz for the death of Mr. Young through
the back door,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Almeida, the state legislator, said the case is not over.
``We feel we're not out of the legal woods yet, and that a federal
overseer will be sent here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a federal probe of the shooting will continue. A
spokeswoman for the Boston office of the FBI said that the bureau
has not concluded its ``preliminary investigation'' into possible
civil rights violations surrounding Young's death.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has been following and will review the grand jury's
action, said Gail Marcinkiewicz, spokeswoman for the Boston office.
If agents determine that civil rights violations might have
occurred, a formal FBI investigation will be conducted, she said.

DUST FLIES AS ANTIQUARIAN BOOKSELLERS REACT TO ONLINE OPERATIONS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   For decades, the antiquarian trade has remained the dusty,
genteel corner of the book market, attracting fiercely independent
booksellers who savor the musty fragrance of brown-spotted rag
paper and the Eureka moment of spotting a rare first edition dumped
in a garage sale heap.
</P>
<P>
   But now the dust motes are flying in the rare and used book
market with the flashy emergence of Alibris, an online used
bookseller that has Wall Street ambitions, Silicon Valley money,
and a strategy that is roiling one of the last bastions of the book
market where small dealers still hold sway. With financial
resources totaling more than $60 million in venture capital,
Alibris is a mix of Internet start-up and industry upstart, a
two-year-old company with a cheeky national advertising campaign
aimed at building a mighty brand on the spines of old books.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business has never had this public persona,'' said Susan
Siegel, who with her husband annually publishes ``The Used Book
Lover's Guides,'' a series of seven regional handbooks. ``It's just
been these little stores that book-aholics and collectors and
academics know about. The Internet has changed that, and
Alibris.com is dealing with customers in a more sophisticated
marketing way that was never needed before.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the battering that Internet companies suffered on the
stock market last week, some analysts question whether Alibris'
plans to lavish as much as $100 million on advertising will be
money well spent.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester Research, an Internet research firm, recently issued a
report predicting that increasing competitive pressures will drive
many e-commerce companies out of business by next year. They advise
companies to redirect resources from expensive ``branding
campaign'' into hard assets, service and speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen their ads and they're very cute,'' said Carrie
Johnson, a Forrester analyst for on-line retail commerce. ``But so
are all these other pure plays that have burned through $50 million
in advertising, and we're watching these disappear. Unfortunately,
there's not a lot of room for new brands.''
</P>
<P>
   Some defiant dealers are refusing to supply books for its Web
site, which draws titles from booksellers lower in the literary
chain and then inspects and marks them up for sale. Others are
searching for alternatives, testing a cooperative Web site of
dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are booksellers who are happily working with the
high-profile newcomer, arguing that Alibris is trying to do what
the vast majority could never afford _ expand the rarified demand
for rare and used books into a mass market.
</P>
<P>
   The hostilities that Alibris has provoked among some traditional
booksellers mirror the same tensions that other industries are
facing over issues of consolidation and the loss of personal
connections. Alibris has stirred the anxieties of many dealers, in
large part because of its corporate trappings and strategies that
stand out among the others like a new paperback on a shelf of
leather-bound editions.
</P>
<P>
   It is not as if Alibris is simply introducing new technology to
the business. The Internet has already helped increase the number
and reach of independent dealers. According to Siegel's survey, the
business has expanded strongly since 1996, gaining 21 percent more
dealers to reach 7,095 last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has enabled many sellers of used book to expand
their customer base to the entire world,'' Siegel said. Sales over
the Web make up from 10 to 50 percent of gross sales for the
dealers she has tracked.
</P>
<P>
   But the vast majority of these dealers are tiny operations. By
contrast, Alibris has a growing staff of 100 at its administrative
offices in Emeryville, a warehouse of books in Sparks, Nev. and
another distribution warehouse planned for England.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as the trade has evolved in the last two years, the
titans from the glossier side of the book business are developing a
yearning for dogeared dustjackets. Amazon.com bought
Bibliofind.com, a database for used book dealers last April.
Barnesandnoble.com struck a supply partnership with Alibris earlier
this year. This month, the nation's largest book distributor,
Ingram Book Group, announced its participation in a $30 million
round of new financing to support Alibris' marketing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Its pricey Madison Avenue advertising campaign has appeared in
The New Yorker, USA Today and Gourmet, promoting battered copies of
books like Lewis Padgett's '50s vintage ``Mutant.'' (April 11,
1977. Freaked you out so bad you had to bury it. Jan. 25, 2000.
Unearth on Alibris for son who shares your sci-fi gene.'')
</P>
<P>
   There's more to come. In the next five years, said Martin
Manley, chief executive of the company, Alibris hopes to spend at
least $100 million to market its titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people have tried to computerize the supply side of the
business,'' said Manley, a former assistant secretary of labor in
the Clinton administration. ``But nobody has taken on the job of
creating demand for this product. Most people believe they can't
find books from their childhood, but using e-commerce techniques we
can bring those materials to the market and we can educate these
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Even with the recent market rumblings, taking the company public
is a strategy that Alibris is still considering for the future,
Manley said. ``Changes in the capital market are not going to
change the business strategy,'' he said. ``We've always been
focused on the retailer and distributor because nobody else is.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Alibris bills itself as the leading source of rare and
hard-to-find books, but there are other existing online services
for used books with a larger pool of dealers _ at least for the
moment. Advanced Book Exchange, which is based in Victoria, British
Columbia offers books from more than 6,000 dealers, compared with
about 1,500 that Alibris says have joined its fold.
</P>
<P>
   But Alibris is moving aggressively to expand. Last October, it
announced the purchase of Bibliocity, an electronic source of rare
and antiquarian books. Meanwhile, Alibris has been eyeing ABE, with
its list of almost four million titles and 18 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Alibris had made overtures to its competitor, Manley
chose his words carefully: ``We've never had substantial
discussions with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Some independent dealers fear that Alibris is moving to create a
monopoly, a fear that was intensified by some recent sharp
Internet-style elbowing for space. In early March,
Barnesandnoble.com alerted antiquarian dealers that it had struck a
new partnership with Alibris to fill its used book orders. That
means that Alibris will be listed first when customers request
out-of-print books from the BN.com Web site. In the past, those
orders had been filled primarily through ABE, which will now be the
second choice.
</P>
<P>
   This change provoked dissent among many dealers because they
could earn more money offering titles through Advanced Book
Exchange, which charges about a $35 monthly fee to list 3,000 books
and leaves it to dealers to fill the orders directly and to keep
the price of the book. In contrast, Alibris exacts about a 20
percent cut of the dealer's final retail price.It operates by
demanding copies for inspection at its Nevada distribution site,
and then repackages the title under the Alibris brand at a
marked-up price for reshipment to a customer.
</P>
<P>
   What particularly irritates some dealers is that the Alibris
process eliminates direct contact with the customer. From her
cramped 840-square-foot Red Wheelbarrow Bookstore in Milwaukee,
Barbara Lightner refuses to list any of the titles in her book
collection specializing in ``avant garde'' political literature.
Instead, she hopes to maintain contact with a wide range of
customers directly through the Internet, which already accounts for
30 percent of her revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barnesandnoble drove a lot of independents out of business and
some used book dealers said Alibris could never do that to us
because we control the supply chain,'' said Lightner, a former
literature instructor at Purdue University who started her
bookstore about two years ago. ``But some of us are concerned that
they could control the databases that we use to make our Internet
sales, and they would be able to destroy our ability to make as
much money on those sales.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Judith Lowry, a second generation bookseller and co-owner of the
seven-decade-old Argosy Book Store suspects that Internet sales are
having an impact on walk-in traffic for her six-story bookstore in
Manhattan. For the first time in 10 years in-store sales are down
slightly. But she gives credit to Alibris for its advertising
campaign, which she says is having a balancing, positive effect.
``As they advertise more, we get more orders,'' she said. ``When we
first started we'd sell five books a week and now it's 15 books
this morning for Alibris.''
</P>
<P>
   The multiplication of online sales has allowed dealers like
Christine Volk, of Volk &AMP; Iams Booksellers, to work from Amador
County in the foothills of rural northern California. Her Internet
sales make up her entire business, which specializes in first
editions in African-American and children's literature. Working
from her outpost with a view of snow-capped Sierras and wild
turkeys, she maintains contact with customers through email and a
new Web site, Bookfever.com.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn DeWeese-Parkinson, a former trial lawyer, makes about 80
percent of his sales on-line and the rest by appointment and
catalogue sales from his home in Cornelius, Oregon. He also
shepherds a continuing and lively debate among book dealers through
his electronic bulletin board, Bibliophile.
</P>
<P>
   For both Volk and DeWeese-Parkinson customer contact _ in all
forms _ is the difference between being a bookseller or a supplier.
It is the reason they do not list their books with Alibris.
</P>
<P>
   Alibris' chief executive, Manley, said he sympathizes with
dealers who want to maintain close ties with customers. But ``a
brand is a promise of reliability, quality, returnability,'' he
said, ``and you can't build a brand out of 2,000 dealers. You build
a brand out of a name.''
</P>
<P>
   That notion is like a red flag for DeWeese-Parkinson whose
specialty is Mexican bullfighting literature. ``Alibris stands
between me and the customer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that as a small specialty dealer the only way I can
stay in business is to be buying for those customers.''
</P>
<P>
   In many cases those relationships are held together by e-mail
since his customers are scattered around the world from Pamplona,
Spain to Providence R.I. ``Finding those people,'' he said, ``is
much more important than the hot experience of finding a nifty book
in a corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Those relationships are at the heart of what makes selling rare
books so personal. When his 22-year-old daughter, Meggan Parkinson,
died in a car crash in May 1997 his book customers arranged for
masses to be said in Guatemala, the United States, Spain and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Before his daughter's death, DeWeese-Parkinson had planned to
race along with her during the running of the bulls in Pamplona.
Instead one of his regular customers, Joe Distler, ran with the
bulls, wearing a sash with Meggan's name.

ADVERTISING: WALL ST. ADS SHIFT FROM WACKY PITCHES TO SOBER
BALANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Super Bowl Sunday, viewers expected a spate of wacky
commercials from the Etrade Group, the upstart online broker, and
they weren't disappointed. One spot showed a hospital patient who
didn't have to worry about health insurance because he had ``money
coming out the wazoo.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was also a commercial about investing for the long
term in which the hopes of a father who had counted on a cushy
retirement financed by his son's career as a professional
basketball player were dashed when his offspring suddenly confided
a desire to enter show business. Another spot, centered on a
disastrous disaster movie, reminded investors that knowing when to
sell might be just as important as knowing when to buy.
</P>
<P>
   By introducing a cautionary note into what had been one of the
most effusive feel-good campaigns of the last year, the
commercials, by Goodby, Silverstein &AMP; Partners in San Francisco,
were indicative of a new trend in advertising for brokerage firms.
Reacting to a recent shift in the investment climate _ not to
mention the gut-wrenching plunge in stocks Friday _ marketers of
financial products and services are moderating their pitches,
playing down irrational exuberance in favor of counseling balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Financial advertising has gotten less silly,'' said Marten
Hoekstra, executive vice president and marketing director at
PaineWebber in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been to cool down considerably a category that
had been positively giddy in its ebulliently optimistic assertions
about how easy it was to make money by buying stocks and mutual
funds. The onslaught of such campaigns, primarily humorous, to
promote brokers, online and traditional, has been one of the most
noticeable signs of the galloping bull market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those funny ads aren't so funny anymore,'' said Jonathan Bond,
co-chairman at Kirshenbaum Bond &AMP; Partners in New York, the agency
for DLJ Direct. DLJ Direct, an affiliate of Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette, has been running ads offering investors wry advice like
this: ``Look both ways before you cross the street. Especially if
it's Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People are much more emotionally affected when they lose money
than when they make money,'' Bond said Tuesday. ``Everybody
remembers Black Monday, but who remembers Happy Monday?''
</P>
<P>
   The ads appearing the last few days take a page from the lesson
plan developed during past wild times on Wall Street. Like the
minicampaigns that ran after sudden sharp downturns in 1987, 1989
and 1998, the special ads focus on themes related to market
gyrations. They assume a calm tone that is meant to reassure
consumers that the sky is not falling. The ads are low key, almost
soothing in the way they stress a long-term perspective and remind
investors that what goes up must at least occasionally come down.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, newspaper ads from Fidelity Investments featured a
photograph of Peter Lynch, its legendary stock picker, and carried
the headline ``The market's wild ride shouldn't throw you off
course.'' And Merrill Lynch ran newspaper ads urging investors to
``be informed'' before they act.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think of ourselves as one of the couple of market leaders
who set the tone for the investment community,'' said James Gorman,
chief marketing officer at Merrill Lynch in New York, which uses J.
Walter Thompson as its agency. ``People need to know where we
stand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The ads are not prepared in advance,'' he added, ``but we're
very attentive to highly volatile markets on behalf of our clients.
We don't react to day-to-day blips, but as we think the mood needs
stabilizing, we hope we're a sober voice in a hysterical
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Sober is a good word to describe the mood that prevails in the
campaigns that started turning up in February and March, when
cracks began showing in the shiny facade of the so-called New
Economy stocks.
</P>
<P>
   For example, PaineWebber ran newspaper ads in mid-March that
warned against embracing companies ``with no earnings and no
well-defined path to ever reaching profitability.'' The ads were
repeated with slight updating on Saturday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been talking about a way to articulate a voice of
reason about asset allocation and portfolio diversification,
directed at the notion of not overexposing yourself to
technology,'' Hoekstra said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make these plans from time to time, when our strategy is
contrarian to Wall Street consensus or investor behavior,'' he
added. ``In this case, we had scheduled ads to run in the next
couple of weeks, but after Friday's market movement we accelerated
the schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   One advertiser not changing its plans is Alliance Capital, which
since February has run ads intended to deliver wake-up calls to
consumers who believe they can increase their retirement nest egg
by playing the market with their savings.
</P>
<P>
   ``A very pretty picture was being painted by the online traders,
that if you had an Internet hookup you'd have wealth beyond your
dreams,'' said John F. Ferrell, president and chief creative
officer at the Alliance agency, Ferrell Calvillo Communications in
New York. ``But it really isn't that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Alliance sells funds through brokers, so the message was that
going online without the counsel of a broker or financial adviser
could lead to problems,'' he added. ``We're saying, `Don't go it
alone.'''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly plain-spoken advice is being offered in ads for an
online broker, TD Waterhouse, which have eschewed words like
``trader'' and ``trading'' for ``investor'' and ``investing'' to
cultivate a less short-term perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our message has been consistent: use our research, invest in
what you know, have long-term goals,'' said Peter Post, president
and chief operating officer at the TD Waterhouse agency, Emmerling
Post in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Coming ads ``might begin to emphasize tools that are helpful
when markets get jumpy,'' he added, like e-mails sent to customers
when stocks reach certain ``downside and upside'' prices.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The volatile market conditions have not caused a decline in
trading volume at TD Waterhouse, Post said, adding that if volume
were to ``fall off, there perhaps would be a possible bias to
increase spending'' to stimulate demand. (Demand for ad space and
commercial time remains robust all along Wall Street, according to
agency executives, who described how some sought-after pages in
national financial newspapers are booked through May.)
</P>
<P>
   Will all the risk avoidance continue in brokerage advertising,
especially in light of the rallies the last two days?
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone can be prudent when the markets go down,'' said Bond
at Kirshenbaum Bond. ``The question is, what do you do when the
market is going up?''
</P>
<P>
   During the boom, DLJ Direct still ran ads deflating the
hyperbole. For example, one poster proclaimed: ``Think an
investment will make you rich overnight? You might want to sleep on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another poster, meant for train stations, asserted: ``Everyone
on this platform has a great stock tip. Problem is, finding out
who's right.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's the Etrade game plan now?
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't jumped at what's going on on the street today,''
said Rich Silverstein, who shares the posts of chairman and
creative director at Goodby, Silverstein, part of the Omnicom
Group, with Jeff Goodby.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have this great newspaper ad _ `Breathe in, breathe out' _
if things go a little wacko, but we haven't run it,'' Silverstein
said, adding that he would call the executives at Etrade to discuss
the possibility of running it, if needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to believe what we've always done is a range of work,
some out there, some saying `Take it easy,''' Silverstein said.
``There are probably some messages we shouldn't be running, but
we've always said `Things are good now but what will happen when it
turns, and it will turn.'''
</P>
<P>
   As for himself, he added, laughing, ``I'm the one who panics and
jumps out the window'' when the bears rampage. ``My wife doesn't.''

AMERICA ONLINE REPORTS RECORD REVENUE AND EARNINGS FOR 3RD QUARTER
</HEADLINE>
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   America Online reported record revenue and earnings in its third
fiscal quarter, crediting subscription growth, advertising sales
and online commerce fees in handily beating analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding one-time items, the company earned 11 cents per
diluted share, beating the consensus estimate of 9 cents, according
to First Call/Thomson Financial, and meeting the so-called whisper
number.
</P>
<P>
   America Online reported its results after the close of the
market. Its shares closed at $60.75, up $2, on the New York Stock
Exchange, still down sharply from their 52-week high of $95.8125,
reflecting investors' concerns about the company's pending merger
with TimeWarner Inc., and the general downdraft affecting Internet
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended March 31, America Online reported earnings
of $438 million, or 17 cents per diluted share, up from $411
million, or 16 cents per share, in the comparable period a year
ago. Revenue rose 38 percent to $1.8 billion from $1.3 billion in
the third quarter of fiscal 1999, which did not include revenue
from Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   America Online's results included one-time gains from the sale
of investments totaling $275 million this quarter and $567 million
in last year's third quarter. (The year-ago quarter also included
one-time charges of $103 million.) Excluding these items, operating
income for the quarter rose more than 155 percent from the year-ago
quarter to $383 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``America Online has never been more robust,'' the company's
chairman and chief executive, Steve Case, said in a conference call
with securities analysts. ``We have never moved so quickly to
capitalize on so many opportunities on so many fronts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the TimeWarner deal, Case said, ``we've never been
more bullish on the prospects for our combined companies than we
are today.'' Alluding to the blurring of the roles of personal
computers, televisions, telephones, musical recording and digital
networks, he added: ``For many years people have been saying
convergence is just around the corner. Today we believe we are at
that corner. The first steps of convergence are already driving
consumer expectations and the more they get, the more they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite competitors' aggressive promotion of free and low-cost
Internet services, America Online added 2 million new subscribers
worldwide during the quarter and ended with 25.8 million
subscribers to its family of interactive services, which also
includes CompuServe and Gateway.net. Revenue from advertising,
commerce and other sources more than doubled compared with fiscal
1999's third quarter, reaching $557 million.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Kiggen, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette,
said: ``This was a very high-quality quarter on every key metric
but particularly advertising revenue. They grew that by a wider
margin than every one of their competitors, including Yahoo, and
that's probably the key earnings driver.''
</P>
<P>
   Case said America Online and TimeWarner would announce a cable
Internet-access deal in the near future, well in advance of the
expected closing of the merger this fall. In February, the
companies released a memorandum of understanding detailing how they
would open up TimeWarner's cable television lines to other Internet
service providers once their planned merger is completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really made a commitment to open access, and we want to
live up to that commitment by articulating the terms,'' Case said
in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Lise Buyer, an analyst with CS First Boston, said investors had
grown more comfortable with the proposed merger. ``There's an
automatic reaction on the part of institutions to sell stocks
involved in a merger. I think the institutions will be back in
droves as we near completion,'' she said. ``So often mergers look
great on paper, but just don't work out, but in this case there's
so little overlap and so much you can do when you combine
TimeWarner's content with AOL's distribution.''

VERMONT SENATE APPROVES LAW PROTECTING GAY COUPLES 
</HEADLINE>
  By CAREY GOLDBERG  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTPELIER, Vt. _ By almost 2-to-1, the Vermont Senate gave
preliminary approval Tuesday to a bill creating marriagelike
``civil unions'' for gay couples. The 19-11 vote signaled that the
Legislature was likely to clear the few apparently minor political
hurdles remaining and pass the most sweeping law in the country
protecting same-sex couples.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrat-dominated Senate also voted down two proposed
amendments to the state Constitution that would have worked against
gay couples. One would have defined marriage as a union between a
man and a woman. The other would have given the Legislature
exclusive authority to confer marriage benefits, thereby nullifying
the recent Vermont Supreme Court ruling that same-sex couples
should be given the same benefits as heterosexual spouses.
</P>
<P>
   The civil-unions bill creates an institution for gay and lesbian
couples almost entirely parallel to marriage, though without the
name. Couples would obtain licenses from town clerks to form their
unions and could go to family court to dissolve them. The 300 or so
benefits that couples would receive include inheritance rights, tax
breaks and the power to make medical decisions for a partner.
</P>
<P>
   But the Vermont bill cannot assure gay partners of federal
rights and benefits, and civil unions, unlike marriages, are not
expected to be recognized in other states.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is expected to vote on giving the bill final approval
on Wednesday. The bill must then pass in the House of
Representatives, which is likely to take it up on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The House passed an almost identical measure last month, after
weeks of hearings and debate that turned up a deep schism in
Vermont between those who favored gay marriage as a civil rights
issue and those who opposed it mainly for religious reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Howard Dean, a Democrat, has said he will sign a
civil-unions measure.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's Senate session, no one spoke forcefully against the
civil-unions bill, but Sen. John Crowley, a Republican, did ask
some pointed questions about whether the bill might not lead to an
increase in homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard W. Sears, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee,
which handled the bill, responded that after all the testimony
lawmakers had heard about the abuse and discrimination suffered by
gay men and lesbians, he could not imagine that anyone would choose
to be gay, civil unions or no civil unions.
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican, Sen. John H. Bloomer Jr., said he was not
sure what the answers were concerning gay marriage, but, he said:
``I do know I represent constituents, that's why I'm here. I'll be
voting with my constituents, which means I'll be voting no.''
</P>
<P>
   But the majority of those who spoke more often echoed the
sentiments of Sen. Jan Backus, who talked about ``tolerance,
acceptance, forgiveness and love,'' or Sen. Jean Ankeney, another
Democrat who said that although she had not had a chance to vote on
women's suffrage or on measures for civil rights in the 1960s,
``Here I am with an opportunity to vote to extend civil rights in
our state. It is indeed for me a high honor, and one I will always
treasure.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. James P. Leddy, a Democrat, read aloud a letter he had
received from a 78-year-old woman on a Williston farm who had borne
eight children and had been told 26 years ago that one son was gay.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew and we know that he was just plain born gay,'' she
wrote. ``I can only say, God blessed us with eight children and my
God made no mistake when he blessed us with homosexuals and when he
gave us our gay son.''

NEW YORK SENATE APPROVES PLAN TO CHANGE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL
PRIMARY RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The state Senate approved a plan on Tuesday that
would knock down New York's notorious barriers to putting
candidates on the Republican presidential primary ballot, and would
make the primary a winner-take-all contest. The Senate's action
makes it likely that the bill will become law.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Republican majority leader of the state Senate,
Joseph Bruno, waived some minor qualms he had, creating a united
front among the party's leaders for the bill, which was proposed by
Gov. George Pataki. ``The bottom line is to create clarity, to
bring a fair election and to avoid some of what's been going on,''
said Bruno, who last month called the existing primary system
``absolute nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the parties do not interfere in each other's
primary rules, so that the Democrats who control the Assembly would
simply pass whatever system the Republicans had agreed on. By that
standard, Bruno's consent was the only obstacle to the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver's office, deep in budget
negotiations, declined to comment on the bill on Tuesday, but
several Democratic Assembly members said that barring unforeseen
problems, they expected their house to pass the Republican plan
next month.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts in election law contend that the bill could run
afoul of the Voting Rights Act because awarding all the delegates
to the top vote-getter would dilute the power of minority voters.
But Pataki administration officials pointed out that California had
undergone scrutiny for similar concerns and the courts had upheld
its primary process.
</P>
<P>
   If the bill becomes law, New York's system will closely resemble
that of most other states, in which major candidates automatically
appear on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans hope that going to a winner-take-all system will
raise New York's profile in the Republican nominating process,
forcing candidates to compete more aggressively here to avoid being
shut out. ``It means more is at stake,'' Bruno said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor and other top Republicans took a political drubbing
this year over their efforts to keep Sen. John McCain off the
ballot in New York's primary, as they tried to orchestrate an easy
victory for their favored candidate, Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   After McCain won some of the early primaries and polls showed
him running strong in New York, the ballot access rules became a
potentially crucial issue in the campaign, one that McCain used to
great effect as he presented himself as the insurgent feared by
party bosses.
</P>
<P>
   McCain won a court fight to get on the ballot, but the criticism
only mounted, as people complained that the form of the ballot was
confusing. In the end, he lost the March 7 primary, winning 44
percent of the vote to Bush's 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The episode became a major embarrassment for state Republicans.
Several public opinion polls showed the governor's popularity
dropping, and his advisers conceded that the ballot access fight
was to blame. Some prominent Republican lawmakers, running as Bush
delegates, lost when McCain carried their congressional districts,
a blow to their prestige. Others who were elected delegates
complained that they had suffered an unexpected scare when McCain
was allowed to compete, after all, and that the affair had
tarnished their reputations.
</P>
<P>
   After the primary, Pataki's aides at first said there was no
rush to reform the system, because it would be four years before
the next presidential primary. But last month, Bruno said he would
push for change this year, and the governor followed a few days
later with his bill.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules would put well-known candidates on the ballot
automatically, rather than requiring them to go through an arduous
petition process that has been called the toughest in the nation.
It would also eliminate the practice of listing delegates on the
ballot, with the candidates they support named only in tiny type
below the delegates' names - a system that caused many voters to
complain that they did not understand the ballot. Instead, only the
presidential candidates' names would appear.
</P>
<P>
   In both respects, the proposed Republican rules would resemble
those used in Democratic presidential primaries, though both
parties still have onerous petition requirements for state races.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor's legislation will ensure that primaries are
decided by the ideas, character and vision offered by the
candidates, the way they should be,'' said Michael McKeon, Pataki's
press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   The rules changes were generally praised by good-government
groups, but Democrats in the Senate raised some concerns, and voted
against the bill. The vote was 36 to 23, along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Martin Connor, the Democratic minority leader, said the way
the bill was worded could undermine the Democrats' ability to set
their own primary rules. Republican lawmakers said that was not
their intent, and that they would adhere to tradition and pass
whatever law the Democrats want for their primary.
</P>
<P>
   Connor, an election lawyer by profession, also argued that the
proposed new system would violate the federal Voting Rights Act,
and several people in his field agreed.
</P>
<P>
   The Act provides for special scrutiny of voting rules in regions
where certain conditions are found, including a history of ethnic
discrimination in elections, a provision that was originally aimed
primarily at southern states. A lawsuit in the 1970s established
that one such area encompassed Brooklyn, Manhattan and the Bronx,
in part because New York state had a decades-old law on the books
requiring that voters pass an English literacy test, even though
such laws had long since been found unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The federal law says that voting laws cannot be changed in those
areas in a way that diminishes minority voting rights, and provides
that such changes go to the U. S. Department of Justice for review
on that question.
</P>
<P>
   Going to a winner-take-all system, election experts said,
appears to diminish the voting rights of minority voters. ``It does
seem to raise some serious problems,'' said Margaret Fung,
executive director of the Asian American Legal Defense and
Education Fund.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In some cases, the courts have found that electing officials on
an at-large basis, rather than by districts, illegally diluted the
voting power of minorities, and voting rights lawyers say that a
winner-take-all primary could be viewed as a kind of at-large
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``African-Americans and Latinos will definitely have less voting
power under a winner-take-all system,'' said Gene Russianoff, a
lawyer at the New York Public Interest Research Group.
</P>
<P>
   Under New York's current Republican primary system, three
delegates are elected from each congressional district, no matter
how many Republicans the district has, or how few. In this year's
primary, in heavily minority districts in New York City where
Republicans are scarce, it took fewer than 1,000 votes to become a
delegate, while in some predominantly Republican, overwhelmingly
white districts upstate it took more than 20,000.
</P>
<P>
   That means that the current system, paradoxically, gives black
and Hispanic voters a disproportionately large voice in a
Republican presidential primary. ``Almost any change you would make
would potentially diminish their voice, which is what the law says
you can't do,'' said Eric Lane, a professor at Hofstra University
law school. ``It creates a very interesting problem for the
state.''
</P>
<P>
   McKeon, the governor's spokesman, noted that there were
winner-take-all primaries in other states, like California, where
some areas come under Voting Rights Act scrutiny, and that the
courts had upheld those systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic party's national rules prohibit winner-take-all
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, Republican candidates must collect thousands
of signatures on nominating petitions, a prescribed number in each
congressional district, to get on the ballot. That system gave the
advantage to the party favorites who had access to the party's
legions of volunteers to do the collecting, and to the lawyers who
were expert at using arcane rules for challenging other candidates'
petitions in court.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would provide that anyone who is certified by the state
Board of Elections as being a well-known candidate would
automatically get on the ballot, as would anyone who qualifies for
Federal matching funds. Candidates who did not meet either
criterion could still go through the petition process.
</P>
<P>
   The practice of having voters vote for delegates also helped the
party favorite. This year, Bush, who was represented on the ballot
by the state's best-known Republicans, while McCain's delegates
were mostly unknowns.

FEE PROTESTERS ATTEMPT TO STORM FLEET ANNUAL MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER AND BRUCE MOHL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As state troopers formed a human wall to keep shouting
protesters out of its annual meeting, FleetBoston Financial Corp.'s
top executives Tuesday defended the bank's controversial fee
increases.
</P>
<P>
   The executives also hinted FleetBoston may make more
acquisitions to bulk up its commercial business lines and announced
plans to spend as much as $2 billion to buy back shares, a move to
support the recovery of its stock price.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in FleetBoston, the region's largest bank, have climbed
43 percent since March 8 on strong results from its investment
units, overseas operations, and commercial banking business. Wall
Street analysts have applauded the relatively high share of income
that Fleet generates from fees.
</P>
<P>
   But the fees have drawn criticism from the Neighborhood
Assistance Corp., or NACA, a local activist group that says Fleet
charges its customers too much and unfairly raised charges on many
customers it acquired as part of its $13 billion merger with
BankBoston Corp. last year.
</P>
<P>
   FleetBoston insists its fees are fair and that the bulk of its
fee income comes from its commercial ventures. Consumer banking
fees are a sensitive matter for FleetBoston, however, because it
faces special scrutiny as New England's largest bank.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, as FleetBoston's chief executive, Terrence Murray,
outlined the bank's strategy in an auditorium at the World Trade
Center, about 50 activists from NACA arrived in 17 rented vans.
Barred from driving up directly they walked to the building's
entrance, chanting slogans like ``Get your hand out of our pockets.
We're fed up with fees.''
</P>
<P>
   Some shoving matches broke out as the activists, led by NACA
chief executive Bruce Marks, tried to push their way into the
meeting room past state troopers and Massport security officers
assigned to the public facility.
</P>
<P>
   FleetBoston representatives said the protestors lacked
credentials as shareholders, though they said the company was
willing to allow Marks and three others to enter. Marks disputes
that and says he may file a lawsuit over the matter.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, Marks said he will also file a complaint with the
Justice Department and federal bank regulators seeking a review of
last year's merger. He said the bank's fees were ``outrageous,''
citing the roughly $36 million in cash and stock FleetBoston paid
Murray and its president and chief operating officer, Chad Gifford,
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Facing little regional competition, Fleet isn't interested in
serving less-profitable customers, Marks said. ``Fleet looks at
working people as a necessary evil,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   FleetBoston's Murray called Marks' complaints about fees
``totally a bogus issue.'' He said fees have gone down or stayed
the same for the majority of former BankBoston customers, and the
bank's total fee income from retail customer accounts hasn't
increased as a result of the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Murray and other executives suggested the protest was chiefly a
bargaining ploy by NACA, which is also negotiating to renew an
agreement to help FleetBoston arrange loans for low-income
homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   A deal NACA struck with FleetBoston in 1994 is about to expire
and Marks said he is seeking new terms under which FleetBoston
would commit about $500 million over five years.
</P>
<P>
   FleetBoston executives wouldn't discuss their ongoing talks with
Marks on mortgage-lending. Marks wields some influence with the
bank since the NACA-assisted loans help FleetBoston meet the terms
of federal rules that require a certain low-income lending
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Marks tried to run an advertisement condemning FleetBoston's
fees in The Boston Globe on Monday. But a Globe spokesman said the
newspaper decided not to print it after concluding some of its
information was misleading.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's confrontation came as FleetBoston tries to show
investors it can maintain its profits and find new e-commerce
opportunities to compete against a host of online-only banks.
</P>
<P>
   Like its peers, FleetBoston seems to be slowly winning back Wall
Street's confidence, partly as the lust for technology stocks cools
off. From a high of $44.9375 FleetBoston shares sank as low as
$25.25 last month before recovering somewhat; its shares rose
$1.1875 a share to close at $36 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Looking forward, Murray said he wouldn't rule out another major
acquisition of the scale of the BankBoston purchase. But he said he
focus would focus in coming months on acquiring what he called
``strategic fillers,'' such as a leasing business, a fixed-income
investment management company, and more units in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Joint ventures are also a possibility, Murray said, as the bank
looks to generate more cash to fund its expansion. FleetBoston will
generate nearly $3 billion in excess capital in the next few years,
which it will spend on e-commerce and other efforts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, FleetBoston expects about 1 or 2 percent of its 2
million customers will close their accounts after the merger,
Murray said. That small defection rate is partly due to his bank's
dominance of the region, Murray acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks after the meeting, FleetBoston's retail banking
director, Robert Hedges, and its managing director of community
banking, Gail Snowden, said the new fees set by the bank weren't
meant to increase income but to move BankBoston customers into new
accounts with comparable terms.
</P>
<P>
   The executives also said some of the bank's merger arrangements
had been negotiated with other community groups and regulators,
including the Organziation for a New Equality and State Senator
Dianne Wilkerson, and meet guidelines from the Massachusetts
Community Banking Council.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview Tuesday, Wilkerson said she hopes
FleetBoston will agree to reduce some fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing is the inevitable result of a market-driven,
profit-minded, competition-less financial environment,'' she said.
``Wherever the banks are, their fees are going up unless somebody
says no.''

IBM, INTEL AND EMC INCREASE QUARTERLY PROFITS, BEATING FORECASTS 
</HEADLINE>
   by STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The engine makers, parts suppliers and plumbers of the Internet
have been responsible for the snap back this week in technology
stocks. Companies like Cisco Systems, Oracle and Sun Microsystems
can be seen as the ballast of the new economy, established concerns
with steadily growing profits as opposed to the bubble of fledgling
dot-com companies with their uncertain hopes of survival.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the technology blue chips _ Intel, EMC and IBM _
Tuesday reported earnings that exceeded Wall Street's expectations.
The laggard of the three was International Business Machines Corp.,
whose earnings rose but whose revenues declined 5 percent in the
first quarter. Big Blue suffered from the lingering effects of the
yearend decline in corporate spending on computers and computer
services by companies focusing on the Year 2000 transition.
</P>
<P>
   That problem is mostly behind it, according to company
executives, who predicted IBM would achieve growth rates of 10
percent or more in the second half of the year. Until then,
however, Wall Street analysts regard IBM a bit uncertainly, as a
company that has not really delivered the proof that its transition
to become a supplier of Internet technology to corporate America
has yet paid off in higher growth.
</P>
<P>
   But both EMC and Intel reported strong advances in revenue as
well as quarterly profits. They join other leading technology
companies _ like Sun Microsystems, which last week reported a surge
in sales and earnings growth _ that are benefiting from the
increased investment in information technology as corporations in
industries from automobiles to banking retool their operations for
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the three companies to announce its results
Tuesday, EMC Corp., is a leading supplier of the equipment
increasingly in demand by companies as they adopt Internet
technology.
</P>
<P>
   EMC, based in Hopkinton, Mass., is the market leader in
producing large data storage systems for corporations. As companies
build Web sites, giving employees, customers and suppliers access
to more and more business information, the demand for large,
high-speed storage systems has mushroomed. EMC, more than any other
company, has benefited from that trend.
</P>
<P>
   EMC said its revenue increased 23 percent in the first quarter
to $1.82 billion. Profits for the quarter jumped roughly 50 percent
to $332 million, or 30 cents a share _ a penny above the consensus
estimate of Wall Street analysts, according to First Call/Thomson
Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ruettgers, the chief executive officer of EMC, pointed
to the rising sales to traditional companies. ``We saw surges in
demand from large companies such as Home Depot, Bertelsmann of
Germany and Korea Telecom,'' he said, ``as they built their
Internet initiatives.''
</P>
<P>
   EMC shares rose sharply after it reported its quarterly figures,
rising $5.625 a share to close at $130.
</P>
<P>
   Intel Corp., the world's largest producer of microprocessors,
also reported strong growth in the first quarter. Revenue increased
13 percent to $8 billion. Its profit, excluding certain expenses
related to acquisitions, rose 52 percent to $3.1 billion, or 88
cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   But those results were lifted $600 million, or 17 cents a share,
by a one-time reduction in taxes because an examination by the IRS
reversed previously accrued tax liabilities. Excluding the one-time
tax bonus, Intel's profit was 71 cents a share, or 2 cents above
Wall Street expectations. Intel's microchips not only power more
than 80 percent of the world's personal computers _ still the
primary devices for accessing the Internet _ but also many of the
larger computers, known as servers, that deliver Web pages, e-mail
and other data from networks to desktop users.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's one real problem seems to be that it cannot keep up with
the torrid pace of orders. ``Demand was stronger in the quarter,
across all product lines, than we had anticipated,'' said Andy
Bryant, Intel's chief financial officer. ``If we had had more parts
we could have shipped them.'' IBM reported that its first-quarter
profit rose 3 percent to $1.52 billion, or 83 cents a share, easily
above Wall Street's estimate of 78 cents a share. But the 5 percent
revenue drop to $19.3 billion in the quarter caused some anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   IBM executives said that certain strategic steps, like pulling
back from the difficult retail market for PC's, had trimmed total
revenue but had also improved profitability. Louis Gerstner, the
IBM chairman, was optimistic about the company's outlook. He said
the investments IBM has made in helping corporate customers make
the transition to Internet technology was beginning to ``pay off in
exciting new growth prospects for us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking forward,'' Gerstner added, ``we continue to believe
that 2000 will be a good year for IBM.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, industry analysts were disappointed that IBM's revenue
from software and computer services _ two businesses earmarked by
management as engines of growth _ were flat. The company also
stumbled in its data storage business, where it is trying to regain
ground lost to EMC. ``IBM has to prove that it has the products and
the strategy to gain market share again in the information
technology industry,'' said Steven Milunovich, an analyst at
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   In after-hours trading, IBM shares fell as low as $112 a share,
after closing at $115.125 a share Tuesday on the New York Stock
Exchange.

LIFTOFF OF NEW WEATHER SATELLITE SET FOR MAY 

</HEADLINE>

c. 2000 Houston Chronicle

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation`s network of orbiting weather eyes will
be back at full strength next month when a new satellite is
launched to replace one that began malfunctioning two years ago,
federal officials announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The GOES-L _ soon to be part of the Geostationary Operational
Environmental Satellite system _ is scheduled for launch May 3,
then maneuvered into orbit 22,240 miles over Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite, a back-up for either of the nation's two primary
orbiting weather observers, was originally scheduled for launch
last year, but it was delayed because of problems with its Atlas II
booster.
</P>
<P>
   GOES images are known best for the moving cloud formations seen
on television weather forecasts. Data collected from the satellites
are a mainstay for U.S. meteorologists.
</P>
<P>
   The GOES system _ run by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration _ uses one satellite over each U.S. coastline to
detect severe weather anywhere in northern half of the Western
Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman for NOAA's National Weather Service, Louis
Uccellini, said the new satellite will ensure that GOES service
will become operational before the next hurricane season begins
June 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the worst hurricane in (recorded) history, forecasters
not only didn't know where it was going but were arguing over
whether there was actually a hurricane or not,'' said Uccellini,
referring to the hurricane that hit Galveston, Texas, in 1900.
``When you see (GOES) images, you know there's a storm out there,
and you know where it's going.''
</P>
<P>
   Since early 1998, the GOES system has been without a
fully-operational back-up satellite, which normally orbits
somewhere between the eastern and western satellites in case one of
those two should malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   The former back-up satellite, GOES-10, was moved into
operational orbit over the West Coast when GOES-9 began
malfunctioning.
</P>
<P>
   GOES-9 has since been in orbit as the spare satellite, although
the images it returns are clouded by static.
</P>
<P>
   The system's third satellite _ GOES-8, which is in orbit over
the East Coast _ has already outlived its five-year life
expectancy.
</P>
<P>
   GOES-L is equipped with the same complement of instruments as
its predecessor, including an atmosphere imager, a moisture
detecting sounder and communications equipment, which can also be
used for search and rescue operations on the Earth's surface.
</P>
<P>
   Later this week, GOES-L will be mounted atop its Atlas II rocket
which will boost it into orbit. After two weeks of positioning and
testing, the satellite will become operational as GOES-11.
</P>
<P>
   The faulty GOES-9 will be shifted to a higher orbit where it
will become space garbage along with countless other outdated
satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Only two former GOES crafts are still in operation. They were
donated to research groups, which use the crafts' communications
systems.

SPORTS COLUMN: CAN A FISH BRING PEACE TO METLAND? 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bobby Valentine found himself in trouble over a
creative writing exercise some college student managed to get
posted on the New York Mets' own Web site. The lad claimed he never
realized the trouble he was causing with his imaginative
interpretation of Valentine's comments.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine had apparently given a witty talk to students at the
Wharton School, with a few admirable defenses of freedom of speech,
and a few examples of baseball economics, until the student, known
forever as Brad34, got inventive and made it seem that Valentine
was ripping his team.
</P>
<P>
   After four days, the Mets sorted out this foray into the
wonderful world of the Web, where anybody with a mouse can be Matt
Drudge.
</P>
<P>
   Now, everybody needed a good laugh. Mary Branca Valentine had
planned to fly up from Texas to spend the homestand with her
husband. She arrived bearing a gift _ a facsimile of a fish,
mounted on a plaque, with the words BIG MOUTH BILLY BASS printed
underneath. Valentine could have taken this personally. He could
have shrieked, ``You, too?''
</P>
<P>
   But it's hard to get mad at a plastic fish. And then Valentine
was treated to the beauty part of this particular fish. It sings.
</P>
<P>
   Press one button and it gives off a rather gravelly version of
Bobby McFerrin's song, ``Don't Worry (Be Happy).'' Not only that,
but the fish also occasionally rotates his head toward the
audience. Press another button and it gives off a somewhat squawky
version of the Talking Heads song, ``The River,'' with the lyrics,
``Take me to the river . . .'' On this one, the fish alternates
rolling its head and its tail.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife said it was the last one in Texas,'' Valentine
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Just about any other manager in captivity would have shared the
joke with his wife, and nobody else. But Bobby Valentine is nothing
if not generous. He brought the fish into the office to show it to
General Manager Steve Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think sharing is very healthy,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   The fish was lying on Valentine's desk, giving its rather fishy
stare at the waves of the news media that flocked in to hear
Phillips and Valentine warble their own particular versions of the
McFerrin theme. They were not worrying. They were happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby and I have agreed we will have no more comments on this
situation,'' Phillips droned. ``We're on the same page on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Somebody noted that neither he nor Valentine has a contract
after this season. ``It's one thing we have that's similar,''
Phillips agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips had rushed out to Pittsburgh when word broke of this
article. His trip wound up as just another exercise in the
dysfunctional, with Phillips receiving some criticism for drawing
attention to some foolscap on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bad for the soul to read all this stuff,'' Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither he nor Valentine cared to discuss the excursion into the
murky waters of the Web. They were putting it all past them.
``Steve and I are on a really good team, and I'm happy to work with
him,'' Valentine recited with far less animation than his singing
fish displayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That put it into perspective for me,'' Valentine said of Big
Mouth Billy Bass. ``My wife was trying to bring a little laughter
to the situation. Let's be happy sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   He was happy, at least until he had to go out and face the
arctic wind and numbing drizzle, as the Mets tried to get in their
game against Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   The game would also be a test for Mike Hampton, who was imported
to be the rent-an-ace for the year, but had lost his first three
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it goes in New York. The Mets deal with Internet
foolscap and controversy and lingering hard feelings. The Yankees
won a game Monday night with the help of an unassisted double play
by the catcher on a tipped ball that should have been called foul.
When you're hot, you're hot.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine did not see any ominous overtones to his singing fish,
and he seemed totally mystified when somebody mentioned that a
talking fish had recently played a major role in the season finale
of ``The Sopranos,'' on television a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   In that episode, Tony Soprano, the underworld chief, is having
fevered bad dreams, which he suspects are linked to a bad meal. The
fish warns him that a close friend is deceiving him behind his
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't watch it,'' Valentine said. ``I don't know anything
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   He has other things to do, like managing a ball club, and
fighting off scares from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it doesn't kill you it makes you stronger,'' Valentine
said, doing his best to not worry and be happy.

THE HEALING POWERS OF HAWAII  
 FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 23) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash.)   By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lee Nagrin left her childhood home, Seattle, to come
to New York City, where in the early 1950s she became a noted Off
Broadway performance artist and director, collaborated with
Meredith Monk and painted. Her younger brother, Bert Swezea, stayed
behind, becoming a popular real estate agent in Seattle, where he
married and had two sons.
</P>
<P>
   Their decidedly different-seeming paths rejoined in 1992, when
Nagrin received news that Buddy, as she called him, was seriously
ill in Maui, Hawaii, where he had formed a new life of the spirit.
Nagrin traveled to Hawaii to be with her brother, who died the
following year. Out of that experience has come ``The Valley of
Iao,'' which opens on Thursday for a three-week engagement at La
MaMa.
</P>
<P>
   In the performance piece, Nagrin explores their two lives,
summoning up her brother's new life on the beaches and streets of
Maui, which he spent with a second wife and with a street preacher
and a musician. Through visual and spoken metaphors, she chronicles
his reconciliation with his previous family and her own acceptance,
with him, of the idea of his death.
</P>
<P>
   These grand themes will be evoked in the magically dark and
cavernous La MaMa Annex Theater in what Nagrin has called a
painting that moves, peopled by 22 performers of all ages, among
them traditional Hawaiian hula dancers. The cast will move
industrial carts and sculptural flags in a processional that
ultimately becomes a small village, lighted from within as little
houses at night, with stars above. The mystical, potent Valley of
Iao in Maui looms over it all, in a work with elements inspired by
the paintings of Fra Angelico and the 20th-century American
outsider artist Henry Darger.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, audience members may walk through the set in their
own experiencing of Bert's life. ``My brother became someone who
sold real estate as a kind of passion for selling the exactly right
house to a family,'' Nagrin said in a recent interview. ``He
believed he was doing something wonderful.'' Eventually, she said,
he became immersed in a search for ``some kind of conduit to the
Lord,'' which he found not in Christianity but in the ancient style
of chanting and hula known as Kahiko.
</P>
<P>
   At age 7, Nagrin had had a similar vision when, walking home
hand-in-hand with her mother from Sunday school, she looked up at
the sky and realized that ``that was the wonder, the mystery I
could discover my whole life.'' A small, round woman with a
deliberate gaze and way of speaking, Nagrin has reminded more than
one reviewer of a benign fairy or witch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my brother really found his heart in Maui,'' she said.
During the last week of his life, she added, ``we were able to
separate, basically, and go on into our own lives. Me into my own,
he into his death. We both knew what we were doing. It was a very
intense time.''

COLONIAL'S ALTERATIONS WON'T LET TROUSERS DROP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Progress has its price. Such is the case
with the 13th hole at Colonial Country Club, where off-season
course tweaks will render it impossible for competitors at the
MasterCard Colonial to duplicate two of the most memorable shots in
tournament history.
</P>
<P>
   Because the lips of greenside bunkers were sharpened, creating
steeper escape angles, no one will be able to putt out of a sand
trap for birdie, as Tom Purtzer did during the final round of his
victory in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll need a 60-degree loft on that putter to get out of that
bunker now,'' said David Hull, chairman of the Colonial greens
committee and who oversaw the $3.5 million course renovation
project.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar fashion, an ornamental rock wall at the shoreline
of a greenfront pond will prevent players from playing shots out of
the hazard. With no reason to wade into the water, players will
have no reason to remove their pants, as Ian Baker-Finch did while
recording his memorable ``Bogey in Boxer Shorts'' during 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Because he had forgotten to pack a rain suit, Baker-Finch
removed his trousers and chipped from the pond wearing blue boxer
shorts. ``It's lucky I had my good ones on,'' he said after his
round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we've altered a bit of history,'' Hull said, laughing.
``No more bunker putts and no more dropping drawers.''

FULL SALUTES ARE DUE FOR COLONIAL, NELSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Spike Dykes, former Texas Tech football
coach and world-class philosopher, once theorized that the subtle
yet significant difference been involvement and commitment could be
found in a plate of ham and eggs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chicken is involved,'' Dykes said. ``But that pig is
committed.''
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, we offer a four-oink salute to organizers of
the MasterCard Colonial and GTE Byron Nelson Classic for their
off-season efforts to enhance PGA Tour events in Fort Worth-Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Each group, in its own way, has shown tangible proof that it
will not settle for mere involvement with professional golf in the
21st century. Both events are committed to keeping star players
roaming local fairways.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, that sounds like a chamber-of-commerce stance. But it's
also an accurate one, based on what has transpired at both courses
since the final putts dropped at the 1999 tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Colonial officials have completed a $3.5 million course
renovation project and bumped the purse for their May 18-21 event
by $500,000, to $3.3 million. Nelson officials have begun the first
phase of a $3 million course improvement effort and bumped the
purse of their May 11-14 event by $1 million, to $4 million. That's
putting your money where your golf is, to the combined tune of
almost $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Among PGA Tour stops, you'd be hard-pressed to find more hard
evidence of long-term commitment than what has unfolded within a
35-mile radius over the past 12 months. That's why 46 of the top 50
money winners from last season, including Tiger Woods (Nelson) and
David Duval (Colonial), are expected to compete in at least one
local event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being right next to each other, you can't help but compare,''
said Patrick McEvoy, Nelson tournament chairman. ``We've got two
unique tournaments, but, hopefully, we complement each other. We're
trying to spread the message that we're serious about making our
event one of the premier events on the PGA Tour. Colonial, I think,
is sending the same message.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of Colonial's face-lift], which required shutting down
the course for 10 months, every green has been rebuilt to original
specifications. Some bunkers have been added, others removed. The
course has been lengthened by 95 yards with new tee boxes at hole
Nos. 5, 7, 9, 11, 12 and 18. Yet most changes are so subtle that
``85 percent of the members will look out there and think that
nothing's changed,'' said David Hull, chairman of the Colonial
greens committee that oversaw the project.
</P>
<P>
   Some ornamental changes, like stone facades on the bridges, will
be evident to fans during tournament week. But the real star of
this show will be the new greens, which have been covered in A-4
bent grass. More resistant to heat than its predecessor, a Pincross
bent, the new grass provides almost twice as many blades per cubic
inch. That means truer rolls and, best of all, elimination of an
infestation of poa-annua grass that plagued Colonial in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to identify his primary piece of feedback from the
renovation, Hull said: ``Everyone compliments the greens.''
</P>
<P>
   They should. Media members joined club officials in a Monday
tournament. The greens were the purest I've putted in Texas. From
personal experience, the closest comparison would be Augusta
National Golf Club. That's not meant as hometown boosterism. That's
a fact.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a fact that Nelson officials are involved in a $3
million renovation of the TPC-Las Colinas layout at the Four
Seasons Resort. Those changes will be implemented over three years,
although the course already is home to 781 more trees than last
year. In addition, the 10th hole has been radically redesigned,
with a new tee box, five new bunkers and a more sloping green. More
major changes are in store, including a lake for the closing hole
by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice to say, there will be nothing subtle about the Nelson's
approach to course renovations. Just as there was nothing subtle
about an April 4 announcement that the Nelson purse _ for the
second time in six months _ would be bumped by an additional
$500,000, to $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, tournament officials benefited from a PGA Tour commitment
to underwrite 50 percent of any purse increase up to $4 million
during the 2000 season. But it was still a bold step. Why take it?
</P>
<P>
   McEvoy said tournament officials wanted to send a message to
other tournament organizers and to players who once objected that
Nelson purses were out of line with the tournament's charitable
contributions. In 1992, the tournament offered a $1.1 million purse
and donated $3.05 million to charity. This year, the purse is $4
million and the charitable target is $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a perception among some golfers that we hope to
change,'' McEvoy said. ``We viewed this as an opportunity to make
people scratch their heads and show them that we're serious. We'd
like to be a bell cow in setting the standard to attract the top
golfers.''
</P>
<P>
   Just don't expect Colonial officials to raise their purse to $4
million ... yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money is not the only answer in this deal,'' said Phil Thomas,
Colonial tournament chairman. ``I can't believe that another purse
increase, at this stage, would affect our field.''
</P>
<P>
   Colonial members, in other words, are comfortable with their
current commitment level. Based on the quality of their off-season
course changes, they have reason to be.  &QL; 
Praise for Haas
</P>
<P>
   Of all the notable rounds played at the 2000 Masters, one of the
most overlooked accomplishments may have been a second-round 73
posted by Hunter Haas, the amateur from Fort Worth who recently
joined the field for the MasterCard Colonial.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's the perspective of John Grace, a Fort Worth
resident and Senior Tour competitor who has walked a mile in Haas'
golf spikes. Grace, 52, played as an amateur in the 1975 and 1976
Masters. He failed to break 75 in either tournament, missed both
cuts and posted a scoring average of 77 at Augusta National Golf
Club.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Grace was intrigued when Haas, 23, bounced back from
an opening 80 to shoot a 73 before missing the cut at Augusta
National Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't realize how good a score that really is,
especially for an amateur,'' Grace said. ``But I do. It's tough on
amateurs to play at Augusta, for a lot of reasons. The golf course
is so different than anything else you've ever played. It's hard to
adjust to the speed of those greens. That's why very few amateurs
play well there. To rebound like that shows me that Hunter Haas is
a heck of a player.'' \Nsubheds:Nicklaus to New Orleans Jack
Nicklaus has joined the field for the Compaq Classic of New Orleans
(May 4-7), where he will compete in the same event as his son,
Gary, a PGA Tour rookie. For Nicklaus, 60, it marks his first
appearance since 1991 at a tour event outside Florida other than
the major championships, the Memorial Tournament or the AT&AMP;T Pebble
Beach Pro-Am.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus, 60, also designed English Turn Golf &AMP; Country Club,
host site of the New Orleans event.  &QL; 
Kuehne adds events
</P>
<P>
   Hank Kuehne, the 1998 U.S. Amateur champ from SMU, has accepted
sponsor's exemptions to the Shell Houston Open (April 27-30) and
the Kemper Open (June 1-4). Kuehne, a Dallas native competing on
the Buy.com Tour, was added last week to the field for the GTE
Byron Nelson Classic (May 11-14). Kuehne said he hopes the PGA Tour
appearances will help hone his game in time to qualify for the U.S.
Open (June 15-18).  &QL; 
Double birdie
</P>
<P>
   Annika Sorenstam successfully dealt with two birdies on the same
hole at last week's Longs Drug Challenge. While sizing up a 15-foot
birdie putt on the 10th hole in the first round, Sorenstam was
distracted by a wild turkey that decided to roost on the green at
Twelve Bridges Golf Club in Lincoln, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   She joined caddie Terry McNamara is chasing the bird off the
green. Sorenstam returned and drained the birdie putt. She went on
to finish in a tie for sixth, 11 strokes behind winner Juli
Inkster.  &QL;

SELIG'S WILL DRIVE REALIGNMENT PLANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ At first glance, Bud Selig's remarks at the owners'
meeting Monday look like they were spoken with a touch of
arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be some realignment, we'll go to an unbalanced
schedule, we'll rotate divisions for interleague play,''
Commissioner Bud said. ``Everything that I wanted to do, we will
do.''
</P>
<P>
   It's fair to criticize the commish for such things as his role
in the 1994 strike that canceled the World Series and his handling
of the John Rocker affair, but it would be wrong to call him
arrogant.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing brash about the statement. It merely serves as
an acknowledgement of Selig's strength as commissioner, namely his
ability to build a consensus.
</P>
<P>
   When the owners next meet in June, there will be moderate
realignment that will move the Rangers to the American League
Central, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays to the National League East and
the Arizona Diamondbacks to the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   There will be an unbalanced schedule, because that lends itself
to good pennant races and intriguing matchups in September.
</P>
<P>
   And there will be new matchups for interleague play, to revive
interest in games between NL and AL clubs.
</P>
<P>
   It won't happen because Selig will brandish his big ``best
interests of the game'' hammer, but because he will convince one
and all that it is the right thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   He will work the phones, listen again to the various gripes that
were aired Monday and in the weeks leading up to that meeting, and
persuade everyone that while his realignment plan isn't perfect,
it's the best option.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things you like to do with the clubs is address
their concerns,'' Selig said. ``The things we heard today and in
the last month aren't anything we didn't know about. You still try
to be sensitive and let people know that you care about their
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to address some problems and we will do that.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those problems is the proposed six-team AL Central, which
would include the Rangers, Cleveland Indians, Chicago White Sox,
Detroit Tigers, Kansas City Royals and Minnesota Twins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make any sense,'' Royals president Mike Herman
said. ``I don't think we're not going to win anyhow for a couple of
years, but when this young team of ours is a contender I'd rather
have a level field like everyone else. If everybody has four, why
shouldn't I have four? Why have two more teams you've got to go
through if they get hot? You just have to use your common sense,
but that doesn't always work for baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   The other problem is the proposed alignment in the National
League, which would have four divisions of four teams. There is
some debate about what teams go where _ do the Astros go in with
the Braves, Marlins and Devil Rays, or do the Reds, who are in the
same time zone? _ but the biggest controversy is the lack of a
wild-card team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The National League really works out pretty well, there's no
question about that,'' Selig said. ``The only negative I've heard
is that there's no wild card.''
</P>
<P>
   That ``negative'' actually is a source of some amusement. When
the wild card was proposed before the '94 season, there was much
consternation about it messing with the fabric of the game. Now,
it's apparently such a part of that same fabric, some clubs can't
live without it.
</P>
<P>
   Selig won't budge on his plan, though, because the schedule
gurus tell him the best way to go unbalanced is to have an even
number of teams per division, and the best way to do that is the
4-6-4 alignment in the AL and the 4-4-4-4 alignment in the NL.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're willing to go back and look at anything, but that
produces in structure the best schedule for the most clubs,'' Selig
said. ``As we address one concern, we have to be very careful not
to disrupt the schedule to the point that every thing we set out to
do we injure.''
</P>
<P>
   If it's the best thing for the most clubs, it will be Bud the
Consensus Maker, not Bud the Brash, that gets it passed.

STEWARDS USE VARIOUS TOOLS TO MAKE THE CORRECT CALLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas _ If there's a close call that doesn't go
someone's way at the horse track, no one charges out of a dugout
and kicks dirt all over the finish line. But that doesn't mean
horse racing doesn't have umpires.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike baseball, however, horse racing's umpires _ they're
called the stewards _ aren't on the field of play. The stewards
view the racetrack from a booth seven stories up in the grandstand
at Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie.
</P>
<P>
   That's too far to kick dirt on their shoes. But the history of
horse racing has stories of fans who showed their displeasure over
a steward's decision.
</P>
<P>
   After a horse was disqualified from first place in a race at
Bandera Downs in 1990, people who had bet on the disqualified
winner beat on the glass surrounding the track's video replay
booth. Don Essary, who was general manager at the time, thought
that was tame. He said he could remember when fans set fires in
garbage cans after a disqualification at Sportsman's Park near
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't happened at Lone Star.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear of that more in Chicago and New York,'' Lone Star
steward John Ferrera said. ``The fans are more vocal.''
</P>
<P>
   There hasn't been anything to complain about at Lone Star. There
have been 38 races through the first week of the thoroughbred
season, but no races were reviewed due to a stewards' inquiry or
jockey objection. The class of racing might have something to do
with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``There sometimes isn't much work for a steward when he's
watching the races because of the expertise of most of the riders
in the jockey colony at Lone Star,'' said Mike Burleson, director
of racing for the Texas Racing Commission and the person in charge
of hiring the stewards. ``By the same token, there are a lot of
upscale stables with good horses that come in to race there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferrera is joined in the Lone Star booth by two other stewards,
Chuck Nuber and Dennis Sidener. They are employed by the Texas
Racing Commission, and they rotate between Lone Star and the
thoroughbred seasons at Texas' other tracks _ Sam Houston Race Park
in Houston and Retama Park near San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Some tools that the stewards use to monitor the racing are
obvious. For a close call at the finish line, they are assisted by
placing judges who find the horse who hit the wire first by using a
high-tech digital photo-finish camera. And if there are horses who
are bumped off course or have to alter course because of
interference from another horse and rider, the stewards rely on
video cameras that provide head-on, rear-view and side-angle views.
</P>
<P>
   Other sports might still be wrestling with the practicality of
instant replay, but it has been a part of horse racing for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's helped especially when a horse owner or trainer has a
question about a decision we rendered they can come back here to
the racing office building and watch the replay,'' Nuber said.
</P>
<P>
   The stewards' decision stands, unless the owner, trainer or
jockey wishes to appeal to the racing commission. The commission
hires a state-sanctioned hearings examiner to listen to the case
and make a proposal for decision at a later date.
</P>
<P>
   But Nuber estimates that more than half of the stewards' work
comes away from the time they spend watching the races. The
stewards keep an office in the barn area where they make rulings on
eligibility of horses, trainers and jockeys and also impose
penalties and fines for misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of it is legal work. So, like umpires who go to umpire's
school, stewards go to stewards school as a part of mandatory
accreditation.
</P>
<P>
   Burleson said it's a 10-day school that is followed by written
and oral exams. There are two recognized stewards schools _ at
University of Louisville and University of Arizona _ and every
three years a steward must participate in continuing education
program provided by those institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Burleson also said Texas law requires stewards to pass an annual
test and eye exam.
</P>
<P>
   Stewards come from various backgrounds mostly related to the
racetrack. Some, such as Larry Snyder at Louisiana Downs and Bill
Hartack at Fair Grounds, are former jockeys.
</P>
<P>
   At Lone Star, Ferrera previously worked as a director of racing
at Fonner Park in Nebraska. Sidener had a training career that took
him through 10 states. Nuber's family has owned and raced horses
since the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in this room has a different background in racing,''
Nuber said. ``That's a positive. When the three of us get together
to discuss a ruling, we all can draw from different points of view.
I think it helps us render a proper decision.''

BUSH STILL CONSIDERING McCAIN FOR VICE PRESIDENT 
 
By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. _ Gov. George W. Bush said Tuesday he plans to
talk to former rival John McCain about being his vice presidential
running mate _ a possibility that McCain rejected previously and
again after Bush's latest remarks.
</P>
<P>
   On May 9 in Pittsburgh, Bush will have his first face-to-face
meeting with McCain since the Arizona senator dropped out of the
acrimonious GOP presidential race. On a daily basis, Bush is asked
whom he would consider as a running mate if he secures the GOP
nomination this summer.
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance with Michigan Gov. John Engler, Bush was asked
again about the status of his deliberations. He surprised his news
media audience by saying that although McCain has repeatedly and
emphatically rejected a vice-presidential nomination, Bush may
offer McCain the right of first refusal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he's said he's not interested, but until I talk to him
and find out how interested or not interested he is, I'll give him
consideration,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pretty outspoken about his opinion, but I want to look
him in the eye and visit with him,'' Bush said. ``I'm going to take
him for his word'' that he's not interested, Bush added, but he
said he'll know for sure once he meets with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many people on the list, there is no list'' of
potential running mates, Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people will be given consideration. Then, of course,
the list will be narrowed over a period of time to get to the final
short list,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush seemed to further water down his comments when he said
Engler, who failed to deliver a Michigan primary win for Bush, also
would be considered. He's made similar comments about Govs. Tom
Ridge of Pennsylvania, Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin and Christine
Todd Whitman of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Engler, Bush said, ``John's a friend of mine. I
like him. I trust him. In spite of the fact that we had a rough go
here in Michigan, he's still a friend of mine.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain spokesman Todd Harris reacted to Bush's comments by
saying ``talk like this is always flattering whether it's from
Governor Bush or Jesse Ventura. However, Sen. McCain has made it
more than clear that he is not interested in being vice
president.''

STOCK CHAOS MAY POINT TO CONSOLIDATION IN ONLINE TRAVEL BOOKING
INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (duplication warning: also sent with `t' code) 
 By JOE SHARKEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week's train wreck in technology stocks drew a sharper bead
on predictions, long ignored by many in the hubris-heavy realm of
online travel commerce, that the future belongs to a relative
handful of Internet companies that can establish themselves as
major brands, with easy-to-use technology to provide the best
service within well-defined travel niches.
</P>
<P>
   That's a mighty grand statement. So let's ask Melissa Shore, the
senior analyst for Jupiter Communications, the Internet commerce
research firm, to bottom-line it instead: ``The big get bigger, the
smaller get focused, and the middle dies,'' she said Tuesday,
discussing the short-term prospects for the online travel industry,
which is now the leading single category of respectable Internet
commerce. (I say ``respectable'' only because the Internet's actual
star money-maker happens to be pornography).
</P>
<P>
   Online booking is not yet widespread among corporate business
travelers, most of whom are required to use company travel agencies
to make their arrangements. Only about 40 percent of employees,
mostly in smaller companies, make their own travel arrangements,
according to PhoCusWright, a leading Internet travel researcher.
However, business travelers are now paying more attention to
Internet booking because companies large and small are increasingly
wiring their travel departments to provide internal online booking
engines affiliated with their existing travel agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some companies now are offering employees the choice to book
online or use the traditional agency service,'' Shore said. ``And
some are planning to mandate the use of online booking in a few
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, that category _ managed, in-house online booking _ is
so new that Internet commerce analysts don't even track it in
projections. But Shore predicted that within a few years, in-house
bookings could well grow to ``dwarf'' the other categories of
online travel booking. In short, the experts suggest, if you're a
business traveler, get used to the imminent prospect, or at least
the opportunity, of going online to make your own arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   This is a rapidly growing phenomenon across the board. Americans
booked $6.5 billion in leisure and business travel online in 1999,
almost triple the amount booked in 1998, according to Jupiter. That
represented only 5 percent of all travel bookings, most of which
continue to be made through traditional travel agents and by
telephone directly with airlines and hotels. But by 2005, when the
growth is expected to level off, about 14 percent of all travel
booking will be online, according to Jupiter projections. That,
however, doesn't include the anticipated increases in in-house
online booking, Shore said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the consolidation in the industry is gathering force.
Last week's dot-com debacle ``certainly adds to the frenzy of it
all,'' Shore said. The trend became notable last year, especially
with the $2.2 billion merger of Saber Holdings Inc.'s
Travelocity.com and Preview Travel Inc., two big online travel
companies that together now have 17 million registered users.
</P>
<P>
   According to PhoCusWright, the online site that booked the most
air tickets last year was Travelocity.com. Expedia.com and
Priceline.com ranked third and fourth, respectively. The other
sites among the top nine belonged to individual airlines, with
Southwest Airlines _ whose Web site is admired for its easy-to-use
technology _ ranking second overall. Southwest, incidentally,
announced Tuesday that its Web site accounted for 25 percent of its
passenger revenue in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Among leisure travelers who book online, low fares are the main
consideration. But the PhoCusWright study found that business
travelers are a different breed. Less than half of frequent
business travelers surveyed said that price was their primary
consideration when booking online. Business travelers also
indicated that, once they have booked online, they are far more
enthusiastic than leisure travelers about doing so in the future.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lesson in the second-place ranking in online bookings
by Southwest, which is a favorite of business travelers: easy to
use doesn't necessarily mean simple-minded. The Internet world is
beginning to catch on to the idea that most of us don't have the
time or patience to wander aimlessly through their virtual
wonderlands. We just want to get to Los Angeles next Tuesday, with
some degree of convenience. And we don't want to spend all day
making the arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Partly reflecting this, Expedia.com said Tuesday that it had
added a new feature _ ``Build Your Own Trip'' _ to its Web site
that allows users to immediately see a wide range of fares for
specific itineraries. It's an astonishingly complicated technology
that is meant to make the booking process both more useful and more
simple, said Expedia, which does about 25 percent of its bookings
in business travel.
</P>
<P>

marketing director. ``The goal with this new feature is to address
the more time-sensitive folks.'' &QL;

STOCK CHAOS MAY POINT TO CONSOLIDATION IN ONLINE TRAVEL BOOKING
INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Duplication warning: also sent with `f' code) 
 By JOE SHARKEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week's train wreck in technology stocks drew a sharper bead
on predictions, long ignored by many in the hubris-heavy realm of
online travel commerce, that the future belongs to a relative
handful of Internet companies that can establish themselves as
major brands, with easy-to-use technology to provide the best
service within well-defined travel niches.
</P>
<P>
   That's a mighty grand statement. So let's ask Melissa Shore, the
senior analyst for Jupiter Communications, the Internet commerce
research firm, to bottom-line it instead: ``The big get bigger, the
smaller get focused, and the middle dies,'' she said Tuesday,
discussing the short-term prospects for the online travel industry,
which is now the leading single category of respectable Internet
commerce. (I say ``respectable'' only because the Internet's actual
star money-maker happens to be pornography).
</P>
<P>
   Online booking is not yet widespread among corporate business
travelers, most of whom are required to use company travel agencies
to make their arrangements. Only about 40 percent of employees,
mostly in smaller companies, make their own travel arrangements,
according to PhoCusWright, a leading Internet travel researcher.
However, business travelers are now paying more attention to
Internet booking because companies large and small are increasingly
wiring their travel departments to provide internal online booking
engines affiliated with their existing travel agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some companies now are offering employees the choice to book
online or use the traditional agency service,'' Shore said. ``And
some are planning to mandate the use of online booking in a few
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, that category _ managed, in-house online booking _ is
so new that Internet commerce analysts don't even track it in
projections. But Shore predicted that within a few years, in-house
bookings could well grow to ``dwarf'' the other categories of
online travel booking. In short, the experts suggest, if you're a
business traveler, get used to the imminent prospect, or at least
the opportunity, of going online to make your own arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   This is a rapidly growing phenomenon across the board. Americans
booked $6.5 billion in leisure and business travel online in 1999,
almost triple the amount booked in 1998, according to Jupiter. That
represented only 5 percent of all travel bookings, most of which
continue to be made through traditional travel agents and by
telephone directly with airlines and hotels. But by 2005, when the
growth is expected to level off, about 14 percent of all travel
booking will be online, according to Jupiter projections. That,
however, doesn't include the anticipated increases in in-house
online booking, Shore said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the consolidation in the industry is gathering force.
Last week's dot-com debacle ``certainly adds to the frenzy of it
all,'' Shore said. The trend became notable last year, especially
with the $2.2 billion merger of Saber Holdings Inc.'s
Travelocity.com and Preview Travel Inc., two big online travel
companies that together now have 17 million registered users.
</P>
<P>
   According to PhoCusWright, the online site that booked the most
air tickets last year was Travelocity.com. Expedia.com and
Priceline.com ranked third and fourth, respectively. The other
sites among the top nine belonged to individual airlines, with
Southwest Airlines _ whose Web site is admired for its easy-to-use
technology _ ranking second overall. Southwest, incidentally,
announced Tuesday that its Web site accounted for 25 percent of its
passenger revenue in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Among leisure travelers who book online, low fares are the main
consideration. But the PhoCusWright study found that business
travelers are a different breed. Less than half of frequent
business travelers surveyed said that price was their primary
consideration when booking online. Business travelers also
indicated that, once they have booked online, they are far more
enthusiastic than leisure travelers about doing so in the future.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lesson in the second-place ranking in online bookings
by Southwest, which is a favorite of business travelers: easy to
use doesn't necessarily mean simple-minded. The Internet world is
beginning to catch on to the idea that most of us don't have the
time or patience to wander aimlessly through their virtual
wonderlands. We just want to get to Los Angeles next Tuesday, with
some degree of convenience. And we don't want to spend all day
making the arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Partly reflecting this, Expedia.com said Tuesday that it had
added a new feature _ ``Build Your Own Trip'' _ to its Web site
that allows users to immediately see a wide range of fares for
specific itineraries. It's an astonishingly complicated technology
that is meant to make the booking process both more useful and more
simple, said Expedia, which does about 25 percent of its bookings
in business travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be less clicks,'' said Suzi LeVine, Expedia's
marketing director. ``The goal with this new feature is to address
the more time-sensitive folks.'' &QL;

MERRILL LYNCH AND HSBC IN JOINT VENTURE
</HEADLINE>
 By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To fulfill its dreams of creating a financial services empire on
the Internet, Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. is teaming up with HSBC Holdings
to offer online banking and investment services throughout Europe
and Asia, the two companies announced on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of merging with a bank or spending billions of dollars
to buy one, Merrill will spend up to $500 million over five years
on its half of a venture that Merrill's chairman, David H.
Komansky, 60, described as the first international combination of
electronic banking and investment services. HSBC, which is based in
London and is one of the biggest banking companies in Europe and
Asia, will own the other half of the venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a stroke, this makes Merrill Lynch and HSBC major players,
maybe the major players, in global e-commerce,'' said Sir John
Bond, 58, group chairman of HSBC.
</P>
<P>
   Komansky and Sir John said that the link was not a prelude to
further ties between the two companies or a full-blown merger, but
they said the arrangement did not preclude either company from
trying to buy the other.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came together so quickly that the companies
have not come up with a name for the operation or chosen a
management team. Until they do, Edward L. Goldberg, 59, an
executive in Merrill's operations services group, will be the
interim chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Merrill rose $9.25, or 10 percent, to $99.50 on
Tuesday, but the announcement probably will not put an end to the
long-running speculation that Merrill will merge with or be
acquired by another big financial company, like the Chase Manhattan
Corp. It does show how Merrill plans to grow outside the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the way financial-services firms are going to do
deals,'' said James P. Gorman, 41, a former McKinsey &AMP; Co.
consultant who joined Merrill as its chief marketing officer last
year. He said the companies could create a system to serve several
countries much faster by working together than either company could
on its own. That approach is new on Wall Street, where firms have
traditionally guarded their products and customers closely.
</P>
<P>
   Together, Merrill and HSBC plan to offer online access to their
services to customers they describe as the ``mass affluent'' in
Britain by the end of the year and in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong,
Japan, Germany and other countries over the next four years. They
will focus on people with more than $100,000 to invest who want to
make their own financial decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Customers will be able to buy stocks, bonds, mutual funds and
other investment products created by the two partners and other
companies. The service will also allow users to write checks or use
debit cards or automated teller machines. It will compete with
different online banks and electronic brokerage firms in different
markets but probably will not be the lowest-priced offering in any
of them, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is somewhat of an acknowledgment by Merrill Lynch that
the self-directed market is not only real but is substantial in
size,'' said Henry McVey, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Until last year, Merrill dismissed do-it-yourself investors as
an unattractive segment of the market. But now, having introduced
an online brokerage service that has received strong reviews,
Merrill hopes to export its new technology along with its
investment research and products, like initial public offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This puts an exclamation point on financial services
convergence,'' McVey said. ``We're at an inflection point where
brokerage companies can no longer just manufacture their own
product and sell it through their proprietary networks. They have
to use alliances to seek alternative distribution channels.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrill has learned through experience how costly foreign
acquisitions can be. Over the last few years, it has paid more than
$5 billion to buy Mercury Asset Management, a mutual fund company
based in London, and extended its network of brokerage branches
into Canada and Japan. In Canada, it bought Midland Walwyn, a
healthy brokerage firm, for $855 million. In Japan, it bought
branches of a failed firm, Yamaichi Securities, and spent much more
than planned to revive the operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are heavy costs and the payback period is really long,''
McVey said. ``With this, you get instant access to a whole new
group of customers and it doesn't put a big drag on your income
statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives of Merrill and HSBC emphasized that they hoped the
venture would attract new customers, not cannibalize their existing
bases. There are 10 million households within the target market for
the new service, said Roberta Arena, group general manager of
global e-business for HSBC, and that number is expected to rise to
50 million in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Komansky said the companies expected the venture to break even
within five years, with operations in some countries turning
profits along the way. Thomas Patrick, Merrill's chief financial
officer, said that, with tax credits for its share of the venture's
losses along the way, the investment should not have a significant
effect on Merrill's earnings. On Monday, Merrill reported
first-quarter profit of more than $1 billion.

U.N. RIGHTS GROUP FOILS U.S. EFFORT TO CONDEMN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS for complete rewrite, changing emphasis; expands; changes
byline) 
(Eds., skedded on some NYT budgets as CHINA-U.N.-RIGHTS) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an embarrassing defeat for the Clinton
administration, the major United Nations human rights body voted in
Geneva on Tuesday not to act on a U.S. resolution criticizing
China's human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   The vote came after the State Department released one of its
most withering annual reports on human rights in China and after
the secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, made a rushed overnight
trip to Geneva from India last month to make an impassioned speech
to the group, the U.N. Commission on Human Rights. It was the first
appearance by a secretary of state before the body, officials have
said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission voted 22-18 to back a Chinese motion for no
action on the U.S.-sponsored resolution; 12 nations abstained. In
effect, Tuesday's vote prevented discussion on the substance of the
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department made an extra effort this year to have
China's human rights practices condemned in what has become an
annual test of Washington's desire to criticize Beijing. The
resolution also failed last year, but the United States committed
less lobbying power then.
</P>
<P>
   By announcing its intention in January to sponsor a critical
resolution, much earlier than usual, the administration signaled to
Congress that it was paying as much attention to rights abuses in
China as to Beijing's desired entry into the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House on Tuesday, a spokesman for the National
Security Council, P.J. Crowley, said the administration was
disappointed. He noted that the vote today was closer _ a
difference of four votes, rather than five last year.
</P>
<P>
   In Geneva, where the assistant secretary for human rights,
Harold H. Koh, led the lobbying campaign among delegates, he tried
to put a positive face on the vote. ``The basic message we sent to
the Chinese was that the United States will stand up for the
Chinese people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the senior Chinese official at the vote on Tuesday,
Qiao Zonghuai, denounced the resolution as ``an anti-China
political farce directed by the United States alone.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's human rights report this year described
China's ``poor human rights record'' as having ``deteriorated
markedly'' throughout 1999 and specifically referred to actions
against Falun Gong, the spiritual movement whose top leaders were
sentenced to long terms in prison in December.
</P>
<P>
   The report also cited Beijing's ``extremely limited tolerance of
public dissent aimed at the government, fear of unrest and the
limited scope or inadequate implementation of laws protecting basic
freedoms.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution itself rebuked China for ``severe measures taken
to restrict the peaceful activities'' of Buddhists, Moslems,
Christians and the Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
   The Beijing government takes the 53-member U.N. human rights
body seriously and has worked hard in the past several years to
thwart Washington's efforts to criticize its record in such a
public forum.
</P>
<P>
   In assessing Tuesday's defeat for the administration, the
executive director of Human Rights Watch, Ken Roth, applauded the
State Department's efforts but said they were not adequately backed
by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``This never became a White House issue,'' Roth said. In
response, an administration official said the National Security
Adviser, Sandy Berger, had brought the issue up with counterparts
in other countries.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In reviewing the vote, Roth said it was clear that among
countries that abstained there were at least seven that could have
been persuaded, with a White House campaign, to vote in favor of
the United States. Among those he cited were South Korea, Rwanda,
Argentina, Ecuador and Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Four votes needed to be changed from abstentions into votes
against the Chinese motion for a substantive discussion on the U.S.
resolution to move ahead. A tie would have allowed discussions at
the commission to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   In preparing for the vote Tuesday, the State Department was
publicly upbeat. Koh told reporters last month that Washington had
the ``best chance since 1995'' to defeat the Chinese motion to
block discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Koh commended Albright, at the time, saying that she was ``more
committed to the issues of democracy, human rights and labor than
anyone I've known.'' He added, ``She is the leader of our team, and
she is in charge of putting forward and advancing our entire
commission agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   But behind the scenes, the State Department had a fairly
difficult task. Their prime goal was to persuade the European Union
to co-sponsor the resolution with Washington, to put up a more
united front against the Chinese and to encourage smaller countries
to stand up to the concerted efforts of Beijing to block the
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   According to an account by a State Department official of
Washington's efforts to build unity within the European Union,
France and Belgium remained holdouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The European Union adopted a sub-optimal approach _ that they
would vote with us on the no-action but wouldn't co-sponsor,'' the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the European Union was against the Chinese motion to
block discussion.
</P>
<P>
   But the official acknowledged that leaders of those European
Union countries in favor of co-sponsoring the resolution, including
Britain, did not go out of their way to lobby other countries for
sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The European Union's commitments on these human rights issues
are concerned with how their relationship plays with Beijing,'' the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   In its efforts to get co-sponsorship, the United States
encountered a recently developed tactic of the Beijing government
in which China offers countries ``dialogue not confrontation.''
Under this rubric, China holds closed door meetings with
governments who say they are concerned about Beijing's rights
record.
</P>
<P>
   Australia and Canada are among those that conduct such a
dialogue with China. Neither co-sponsored the U.S. resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The United States also held a human rights dialogue with the
Chinese in 1999 but the Chinese canceled the dialogue for 2000 _ a
visit by Chinese officials to meet with administration officials _
after the bombing of their Belgrade embassy during the Kosovo war.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the year of the summit between the Chinese leader,
Jiang Zemin and President Clinton, Washington did not submit a
resolution to the human rights commission, saying there were
improvements in the record.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the United States succeeded for the only time in
defeating the Chinese government's procedural vote to block
discussion.

DIGITAL REVOLUTION IN IRAN
</HEADLINE>
 By HOMAYOON HARIRI Written with VIVIENNE WALT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was working on my computer science graduate project in Tehran
when the Islamic revolution broke out in Iran in 1979. It was so
exciting; it's hard to describe the feeling. I was 28. Everyone
took part in the revolution, hand in hand. There was no difference
between religious people and those who had their own ideas. We just
hoped for a better country.
</P>
<P>
   I grew up in Tehran and got my electrical engineering degree
from Shiraz University. If I hadn't gone into computers, I would
have become a heart surgeon or maybe a university professor. But
during my military training, for about 18 months I was working in
an army computer center, and I really liked it.
</P>
<P>
   Some of my friends left the country. When I was finishing my
bachelor's degree I thought about continuing my studies overseas.
But then, after a while, I forgot all about it. I've had short
business trips to England, France, Germany and even Dubai, in the
United Arab Emirates. But I wouldn't want to live in any of them. I
thought I could help Iran by using my expertise.
</P>
<P>
   When I graduated, I got a job for the government, running the
computer department for the railways. After about 10 years there, I
started my own company. That was nearly 12 years ago. We develop
software and create management-information systems.
</P>
<P>
   We are very interested in exporting our software, like India
does. But we are under economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   We've discussed ideas with about 10 companies in Canada,
England, Dubai and Saudi Arabia. But whenever it gets to the point
of signing a contract, everything freezes.
</P>
<P>
   We signed a contact with a company in Sheffield, England, to buy
software from them. But about eight months ago they told us they'd
been bought by an American company and had to end their
relationship with us. We'd made about a $30,000 investment.
</P>
<P>
   I think the best kind of business connection we could have with
the United States would be to work on outsourcing.
</P>
<P>
   They could order us to develop software for them. We'd do it
even better than India. The rate of pay is very low here. We pay
software engineers about $50 a day. But it won't happen until the
United States lifts the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Our engineers are very young. They've heard a lot of stories
about young Americans getting very rich. Some have emigrated to
Canada, others are looking for jobs. But people love the
environment of this company.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the software we use in the company is Microsoft. When
friends fly to Dubai, they bring back software we need. But they
can't give us any training or support, and we always have problems.
They have no representatives in Iran, so we have to solve all our
problems ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is growing very, very fast in Iran. There's no way
to escape it.
</P>
<P>
   In three years' time most of the television sets will be digital
and automatically connect to satellite television. That's banned
right now. But 10 years ago, VCR's were forbidden; eventually, they
had to change the law.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody can prevent people from getting information. When they
have information from outside, this will have an influence on
people.
</P>
<P>
   I have two children: my son is 24 and is finishing his last year
of university, studying software engineering and working with me as
a Web designer. My daughter's finishing high school. She wants to
study English literature at university. I'm sure they will stay.
They both love this country.

CART-INDY FEUD TAKES ITS TOLL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's news-views-and-phews edition of The Sporting Muse:
</P>
<P>
   News: Long Beach Grand Prix a huge success once again, bids
adieu until next year.
</P>
<P>
   Views: There is a trend about the Grand Prix that bears
watching. Each year, it seems more and more people attend the event
for its ambiance than its exhaust. It has always been a great
party, but there were plenty of gearheads in the crowds when the
Unsers and Andrettis were regulars. The current CART roster is
loaded with talented, promising drivers, but most of them hail from
Brazil or Europe. Add the ever-growing reputation of NASCAR, and
one can see why CART events and its drivers are suffering from a
lack of exposure.
</P>
<P>
   The snit between CART and Indy has hurt everyone involved, to
the point where even the casual customers can note a difference.
Take the example of driver Kenny Brack. The 1999 Indy 500 champ was
in Long Beach, but who knew or cared? His Indy win was hollow
because the best drivers weren't there, and he was just another
driver in Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   CART and Indy need to come to terms with their problems soon,
for the sake of themselves and cities like Long Beach that have
supported them so well.
</P>
<P>
   News: Renovations at Dodgers Stadium are unveiled.
</P>
<P>
   Views: I expected the worse, so I was pleasantly shocked that
the changes were subtle and effective. The extension of the field
seats was seamless and made the whole park seem more intimate. The
new suites on the club level turned out to be more aesthetic than
originally planned. Plus, the club was able to retain a handful of
club seats, so not every former season-ticket holder was forced to
move.
</P>
<P>
   One potential drawback: The corporations that can afford season
tickets for the new field seats don't always use their tickets, and
the sight of empty seats down is very Clipper-esque. The team needs
to work out a system that will put a butt in every new seat down
there.
</P>
<P>
   News: Kings play their last game of the season tonight at the
Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Views: Their current 0-3 first round playoff status against
Detroit was predictable. It's not the Kings' fault that the Western
Conference is loaded. Detroit simply has more and quicker forwards
than the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the Kings are still trying to overcome the league's
mid-season rule changes of two seasons ago, when it legislated
against the neutral zone trap. Larry Robinson's Kings used the trap
and employed bigger players to make it work. Kings' G.M. Dave
Taylor attacked that problem in the off-season and he'll need to
attack it again this off-season. Kings fans hopefully will remain
patient. Taylor and coach Andy Murray have the team headed in the
right direction.
</P>
<P>
   News: Kings critics say Jamie Storr should be tonight's starting
goaltender. Views: I agree. But not because of anything Stephane
Fiset has or hasn't done. The Kings simply need to shake things up
after three straight losses. Considering their 0-for-series power
play stat, maybe the Kings can use Storr on the point.
</P>
<P>
   News: Baseball postpones talks on realignment until June.
</P>
<P>
   View: Bud Selig's plan to have four divisions in the N.L. and
one six-team and two four-team divisions in the A.L. doesn't have a
lot of support. So what would be wrong with going back to two
divisions per league? It's the easiest way to make things work and
keep the wild cards involved short of trashing both leagues and
starting over from scratch (a horrible idea that I shouldn't have
even mentioned).
</P>
<P>
   One man's suggestion:
</P>
<P>
   A.L. East: Baltimore, Boston, Cleveland, Detroit, New York,
Tampa Bay and Toronto. This keeps the essence of the old A.L. East
intact.
</P>
<P>
   A.L. West: Anaheim, Chicago, Kansas City, Milwaukee, Minnesota,
Oakland and Seattle. All of these teams have been division-mates in
the past. Milwaukee never should have moved to the N.L. in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   N.L. East: Atlanta, Chicago, Florida, Montreal, New York,
Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, St. Louis. Keeps the important St.
Louis-Chicago rivalry intact.
</P>
<P>
   N.L. West: Arizona, Cincinnati, Colorado, Houston, Los Angeles,
San Diego, San Francisco and Texas. Likewise, they've all been
mates before except for Texas. Taking in Texas and shipping the
Brewers out solves the desire of the Rangers and Astros to be in
the same division. This plan also keeps the D-Backs in the N.L.
</P>
<P>
   If Selig insists on staying in the N.L., put him in the N.L.
West and send Colorado to the A.L. West. If ever a park was made
for the DH-ing A.L., it's Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduling? In the two divisions of eight teams in the N.L.,
teams would play 16 games against division-mates (112 games), four
games against each team in the other division (32), and 12
interleague games (158 games total) based on interest and
geography.
</P>
<P>
   In the two divisions of seven teams in the A.L., teams would
play 17 games against division mates (102), six games against each
team in the other division (42), plus 12 interleague games (158
games total). Each division champ and best two wild cards per
league advance to the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   News: USC's R. Jay Soward goes in the first round of the NFL
draft while UCLA's Danny Farmer goes in the fourth. Raiders pick a
placekicker in round one.
</P>
<P>
   Views: The Soward-Farmer debacle underscores how skewed-up the
NFL is. Soward was unreliable as a Trojan, but fast enough to get
first-round money. All Farmer did was catch everything thrown at
him as a Bruin.
</P>
<P>
   The Raider pick of Sebastian Janikowski makes sense. They have
often reached for a player with an off-field dossier (Anthony Smith
1990, Todd Marinovich 1991, Chester McGlockton 1992). Not only do
they embrace that type of player, but it also allows them to
occasionally pay them under the going rate.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, they've been desperate for a kicker since 1996. In the
last three seasons, the Raiders made just 51 of 82 field goals.
They have gone 20-28 in those three seasons, with ten losses by
three points or less. All eight Raider losses last season were by a
touchdown or less.
</P>
<P>
   News: John Rocker returns to the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Views: If he gets a standing ovation from Braves fans in his
first appearance, Atlanta management can go ahead with its Sheet
Night promotion in August.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ One of this season's more rewarding sleepers is
``Overcoming All Obstacles: The Women of the Academie Julian'' at
the Dahesh Museum, in Manhattan. This little museum is an oasis of
quiet and comfort. Visitors, though not always numerous, tend to be
keenly attentive. The subject matter makes very good points at
every turn but does not set out either to bully or reproach us.
</P>
<P>
   It is in every history of French painting that in 1868 Rodolphe
Julian, a former wrestler, founded an independent art school in
Paris that remains active to this day. It was the only place in the
city at which a woman could study art intensively in a well-lighted
room from a living model and count on being taught by artists of
substantial quality.
</P>
<P>
   Though decidedly comical in his own appearance, and a lifelong
favorite of caricaturists, Julian was not at all stupid. He knew
that his school responded to needs and ambitions that could not at
that time be satisfied anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Women were not yet admitted to the official Ecole des
Beaux-Arts. Julian made it possible for them not only to be taught
by established artists but also to work in class from naked models,
male as well as female.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers recruited by Julian included Adolphe-William
Bouguereau, Tony Robert-Fleury and Jean-Paul Laurens. Though their
reputations may by now largely have faded, they were national
figures at the time, undoubtedly fascinating to their students. In
addition, Bouguereau had married one of his students, a young
Englishwoman called Elizabeth Gardner, so why should others not be
as fortunate?
</P>
<P>
   The Academie Julian was distinctly an original idea whose time
had come, and before long students from all over the world were
applying for admission. Julian was eager, but not at all
disinterested. (Fees for women at his academy were twice as high as
fees for men).
</P>
<P>
   Nor did he accept young people who thought that life in a
Parisian art school would be soft. He kept strictly professional
standards, set his fees as high as the market would bear and was no
fool when it came to spreading the word overseas.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the students in his school included a Philadelphian,
Cecilia Beaux; a Pole, Anna Bilinska; a Californian, Anna Klumpke;
two Germans, Louise-Catherine Breslau and Kathe Kollwitz; a
Russian, Marie Bashkirtseff; and others from Belgium, Sweden and
elsewhere. There was also a hardy body of young Englishwomen who
braved the rigor of grim lodgings and early-morning starts.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to realize that this school proselytized not for
``modern art'' but for superior Salon art. It was through the Salon
that reputations were made. Artists who had never been accepted for
the Salon were unlikely to make a living, let alone a name.
</P>
<P>
   After work by former students at the Academie Julian was first
exhibited in New York, by the Shepherd Gallery in 1989, the school
got a burst of renewed life from Catherine Fehrer, whose father,
Oscar Fehrer, had studied there. Not only did he talk about it with
his daughter at great length, but he also put her in touch with
invaluable, never-before-explored source material in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The present exhibition would in fact have been incomplete
without her advice, her research and her discovery of irreplaceable
archival material.
</P>
<P>
   Those who feel like spending $29.95 on the catalog of this show,
which is on view through May 13, will find what is in effect an
extensive supply of archival photographs, illustrated cartoons and
newspaper articles, together with essays that fill out the whole
history of the Academie Julian.
</P>
<P>
   But with or without the catalog, they will be quietly seduced _
``sedated'' might be as apt a word _ by the sheer comfort of almost
everything that is on view. There is nothing rough, nothing
violent, nothing bitter and nothing provocative about ``Overcoming
All Obstacles.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all was peace and harmony among the female students at the
Academie, however. Marie Bashkirtseff came from a moneyed family
and didn't care who knew it. If she got to class late, as she often
did, she would throw a tantrum unless the best place in the studio
had been kept for her. If she sensed that people thought Breslau
was the better painter of the two _ as many did _ Bashkirtseff knew
how to make herself obnoxious.
</P>
<P>
   But at the Dahesh Museum we don't have to bother with that.
Bashkirtseff looks adorably demure in her self-portrait. As for
Breslau's portrait of the English versifier Henry Davison, he is
the very apotheosis of English foppery. Oscar Wilde should have
written an immortal comedy expressly for him.
</P>
<P>
   In thinking over the impact of this exhibition, the word
``nice'' keeps coming to mind. The room is nice, the staff are
nice, the chairs are nice and the silence (with Fifth Avenue just a
yard or two away) is blissful. And there is a place, after all, for
nice art.
</P>
<P>
   But nice art need not be insipid. There is a drawing by
Rose-Marie Guillaume of someone called simply ``Mademoiselle
Breuil'' that is typical of the quality described in the catalog by
Gabriel P. Weisberg as ``a sense of introspection and strong
individuality.'' It should not surprise us that she held her own in
the Salons.

   William Harris writes about avant-garde dance, theater and art.  
 By WILLIAM HARRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Offstage, the Montreal-based choreographer Marie Chouinard could
pass for Joni Mitchell's double, with her sleek 5-foot-8-inch
frame, her fragile beauty and her long, blond hair.
</P>
<P>
   Onstage, her persona is fiercer. During her 22-year dance
career, Chouinard has been called everything from ``the high
priestess of choreographic shock'' and ``a sorceress'' to ``the
praying mantis in the hothouse of Quebec dance.''
</P>
<P>
   And little wonder. In her piece ``Petite Danse Sans Nom''
(1980), Chouinard walked onstage, drank a glass of water, crossed
the space, urinated in a bucket, then exited. In ``Mimas, Lune de
Saturne'' (1981), she simulated masturbation, with a human skeleton
standing sentry. Or consider her ``L'Apres-Midi d'un Faune''
(1982), Chouinard's homage to Vaslav Nijinsky. In her Debussy-less
version, the dancer breaks off a horn from her head and reattaches
it to the crotch of her costume, where it becomes an erect phallus.
</P>
<P>
   These and eight other solo dances _ including her first,
``Crystallization'' (1978) _ are being presented by Compagnie Marie
Chouinard in a rare appearance in New York at the Joyce Theater for
five performances, beginning on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Les Solos 1978-1998,'' as the two-and-a-half-hour evening is
called, will not be performed by Chouinard, as the dances were
originally, but by three other women, Lucie Mongrain, Carole Prieur
and Elise Vanderborght.
</P>
<P>
   Chouinard is obsessed with the body, the delicate architecture
of its circulatory, muscular and skeletal structures, and its more
practical functions. Using contorted, spastic movements, often
accompanied by the amplified sound of breathing, she creates moody
meditations that celebrate life's mysteries _ and its impermanence.
</P>
<P>
   The work is about time and transformation, presented with a
theatricality that is both showy and unsettling. As Anna Kisselgoff
noted in a 1990 review in The New York Times, ``Marie Chouinard
specializes in imagery that most would like to repress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in awe of the systems of the body,'' said Chouinard,
smoking a panatela during a recent interview in New York. ``My work
explores the intelligence of the body _ its soul _ to touch what is
unknown, to make incarnate something that has never been
incarnated.''
</P>
<P>
   Chouinard began studying ballet as a teen-ager, not because she
had dreams of becoming a dancer but because she wanted to be an
actress and felt uncomfortable in her gangly body. ``I did not
think of dance as an art form when I was training,'' she said.
``Then I saw a performance of Simone Forti,'' the pioneering
postmodern choreographer of the late '60s and early '70s whose
dances were built from pedestrian movement. ``It was a revelation
to me. I was 21. It was like traveling into another dimension, like
taking drugs. I loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently, Chouinard created ``Crystallization.'' Twelve
years later she formed her company, having choreographed more than
30 solos for herself in the interim. She supported herself by
teaching ballet classes.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are two Compagnie Marie Chouinards. The larger one,
a 12-person troupe, presented a new work, ``Le Cri du Monde,'' in
Toronto in March. The three women touring ``Les Solos'' have been
on the road nonstop since the fall of 1998. Last year, they gave
more than 50 performances.
</P>
<P>
   Why revive older work? ``I hope they are not old, it's just
work,'' said Chouinard, now the mother of a 2{-year-old son. ``It's
good to see it again, like revisiting a painting in a museum.
Besides, 20 years is not a long time.''

THE BALLAD OF WOODY GUTHRIE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 23) 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hal Ashby's 1976 film biography of the militant singer-composer
Woody Guthrie, ``Bound for Glory,'' misses critics' four-star
ranking by a fraction, which isn't bad for a film with some
weaknesses to go along with its considerable strengths.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby, who died at age 59 in 1988 and whose credits include
``Harold and Maude'' (1971), ``Shampoo'' (1975) and ``Being There''
(1979), had a feeling for quirky characters. Guthrie, played with a
lanky, languid grace by David Carradine, is more paragon than
quirk, but the performance is strong and unusual enough to carry
the film even when the narrative occasionally fails it.
</P>
<P>
   Guthrie's funny, biting songs are another strength, of course,
as are the film's look and atmosphere. ``Bound for Glory'' (MGM,
146 minutes, $24.98, PG) is one of those old movies that gets a
substantial second wind from the clarity of DVD.
</P>
<P>
   The cinematographer Haskell Wexler, who won an Academy Award
(the best-picture Oscar went to ``Rocky'' that year), gives the
film a caramel, sun-blasted grittiness perfectly suited to
Guthrie's travels in the '30s and '40s among migrant farm laborers
streaming from the Southwest dust bowl to the California fruit
ranches.
</P>
<P>
   The film begins in Pampa, Texas, in 1936 with a towering dust
storm riding in on 75-mile-an-hour winds. From that moment, no one
gets the sand out of boots or the sweat and grime off faces or out
of dresses and overalls. As the exodus rolls west toward the
Pacific, Wexler's camera catches harsh beauty in the bleak, azure
sky and the procession of vintage cars and trucks, festooned with
great piles of furniture hung from every hook and knob.
</P>
<P>
   Anxious faces speak of extreme stress, and in bedraggled camps,
occasionally swept by growers' club-wielding goons, the newly
arrived marshal their paltry belongings for new lives no more
promising than the ones they have left.
</P>
<P>
   In their midst Guthrie begins to make a name for himself as an
agitator and performer, touring the settlements and fields with an
Ozark singer and labor organizer (Ronnie Cox) and getting into
skull-cracking brawls with management men. Soon he is on the radio,
but his stinging songs of protest bother his corporate sponsors to
the point that he's told to limit his performing to toothless folk
ditties. Instead, he walks out on a lucrative contract and returns
to the fields.
</P>
<P>
   From these roots emerges Guthrie the minstrel and voice against
social injustice heard in songs like ``A Mighty Hard Road.'' The
Carradine portrayal makes him cool and magnetic, a man who can take
a beating and still glide through his crises.
</P>
<P>
   People who knew Guthrie say that he kept a positive attitude no
matter what befell him. ``The one thing I can say about Woody, more
than anything else, is that he loved living,'' says his manager in
notes included with the disc. ``Everything that could happen to a
man happened to him and it's hard to believe but he was almost
always happy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the film, though, there is something cold about the man. He
may never have deserted the cause, but he did leave a wife and two
children _ not once but twice _ to hop on a freight train, as his
song says, bound for glory. So the calling was large, but where is
the private Guthrie? Carradine's Woody has plenty of
indomitability, but the smaller, telling moments that truly reveal
a character seem oddly impersonal and contrived more in the service
of legend.
</P>
<P>
   But one can't fault the freight trains. Wexler's camera is at
its best around box cars full of the brawling dispossessed swaying
and clacking over the parched land under a broiling sky. Watching
them one can't help feeling nostalgic for a time and place
hauntingly American. It happened that way. The era lives.

BRAVURA ROLES OF MOODS AND MEMORIES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 23) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn.)   Matt Wolf is the London theater critic for Variety and a regular
writer on the arts from Europe.  
 By MATT WOLF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ It would be an easy assumption to make, but a wrong
one, to think of Sinead Cusack as famous by association. In her
native Ireland, her surname evokes immediate associations to that
country's eminent acting clan. Not only was her father, Cyril, one
of the last century's best-known Irish performers, but having been
born into celebrity, Cusack proceeded to marry a man who became
one: Jeremy Irons, the film star.
</P>
<P>
   Cusack, however, has garnered an impressive share of acting
renown of her own. Last week she opened Off Broadway at the Irish
Repertory Theater in Sebastian Barry's ``Our Lady of Sligo,''
reprising a role that, at the Royal National Theater, won her a
Critics' Circle Award and an Evening Standard prize for best
actress in London in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Playing the angry, alcoholic, cancer-ridden Mai O'Hara _ a
portrait of Barry's own grandmother _ Cusack moves in and out of
bed, shifting moods (and years) at will, as she summons the
memories of her weak husband (played by Jarlath Conroy) and bitter
daughter (Melinda Page Hamilton).
</P>
<P>
   Describing the London production, John Peter wrote in The Sunday
Times that Cusack ``gives the most harrowing performance of her
career, the most expertly articulated, the gravest, the most
painfully hilarious, the most venomous and most deeply felt.''
</P>
<P>
   Cusack is succinct: ``It's a mountain, compared with a lot of
the little hillocks that I've climbed before,'' she said, although
she hasn't been exactly neglectful of the classical canon. She last
appeared on a New York stage in 1985 with the Royal Shakespeare
Company, playing in repertory as Roxane in ``Cyrano de Bergerac''
and Beatrice in ``Much Ado About Nothing.'' (Her co-star was Derek
Jacobi, who is making his own return to the New York stage this
season in ``Uncle Vanya'' on Broadway.)
</P>
<P>
   In London and Dublin in 1990, Cusack joined her father and two
of her sisters in an all-in-the-family production of Chekhov's
``Three Sisters.'' Two years later, she surpassed her own
performance as Masha, the middle Prozorov, when she revealed the
scarred soul at the core of Brian Friel's ``Faith Healer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She takes no prisoners,'' said Joe Dowling, the Irishman who
directed that ``Faith Healer'' at the Royal Court Theater, and who
has known Cusack since their student days at University College
Dublin. By that point, she had changed her first name from Jane to
its Gaelic equivalent, Sinead (pronounced shuh-NAY-ed).
</P>
<P>
   Carving out that career in the face of the fame her father had
and her husband has can't have been easy,'' Dowling said from the
Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, where he is the artistic director.
``She has made her own life so individually from her own gift.''
</P>
<P>
   To hear Cusack, 52, describe it, the advancing years have been
kind to her in a profession that doesn't always know what to do
with actresses in middle age: ``The work I've done in the last
decade has been more challenging than I could have done before. I
went about my career probably the wrong way round, in that I
possibly should have done my theater work in my 20s and, instead,
was taken up with television and film and was very unskilled and
had no craft. In my 30s, I decided to right that wrong and started
working in classical theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Her stage career has co-existed with roles on the large and
small screens. She has her own leading part in ``My Mother Frank,''
an independent Australian movie scheduled for release later this
year, and many filmgoers reserve a particular soft spot for ``Bad
Behavior,'' the sweet-tempered 1993 British movie in which she and
Stephen Rea play gently embattled North Londoners.
</P>
<P>
   She has also played opposite her husband in ``Waterland'' (1992)
and ``Stealing Beauty'' (1996), among other ventures. The two were
young actors sharing a stage door in separate London productions
when they first met 26 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the defining role in ``Our Lady of Sligo'' that can be
said to draw on an actor's lifetime of experience and technique.
The play invites comparison with ``The Steward of Christendom,'' an
earlier work by Barry that, like this one, puts an ailing and
bedridden Barry forebear at centerstage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Steward of Christendom'' visited the Brooklyn Academy of
Music to warm reviews several years ago, with the great Donal
McCann in the rending title role. But Max Stafford-Clark, the
English director of both Barry plays, pointed to a crucial
difference between the two that is well beyond the gender of their
central characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways,'' Stafford-Clark said, `` `Our Lady of Sligo' is
a more difficult play in that it is about someone to whom Sebastian
doesn't so easily extend grace and redemption. It trivializes it to
say that `Our Lady' is simply the distaff version of `Steward.'''
</P>
<P>
   Both plays do, however, allow for unmistakable bravura. ``I bob
about all over the place in my morphine-induced hysteria or
euphoria,'' Cusack said of the demands of the part. ``It's the
wonders of morphine, really. You can do anything you like on
morphine.''

BUSH ROLLS OUT PLAN FOR AFFORDABLE HOMES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATTLE CREEK, Mich. _ Standing on the front porch of a modest
new house Tuesday, presidential candidate George W. Bush unveiled a
$1.7 billion plan to help more Americans afford their own homes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his proposal for special tax credits for builders and
lenders would not only help more people achieve ``the American
dream,'' but would improve entire neighborhoods and lead to better
schools.
</P>
<P>
   But the presumptive Republican nominee's compassionate pitch was
quickly criticized by housing advocates for the poor. They said his
plan would be more helpful to people with moderate incomes.
</P>
<P>
   And while Bush said his plan would build or fix up 100,000
houses over five years by giving investors tax credits of up to 50
percent of project costs, his critics called that a small attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to see this as a real low-income initiative,'' said
John Henneberger, co-director of the Texas Low-Income Housing
Information Service. ``It's more of a moderate-income initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines for Bush's plan call for families who earn up to
80 percent of area median income to be eligible. Henneberger and
other low-income housing advocates say the need is greatest among
those earning less than half the median income _ or $28,350 for a
family of four in the Houston area.
</P>
<P>
   Under Bush's plan, a Harris County family of four earning as
much as $45,360 would qualify.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Henneberger said Bush's program would be beneficial and should
be enacted, but ``we're still looking for a major low-income
housing initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   Most current federal and state programs help the poor pay for
rental housing or promote construction of apartment buildings, not
single-family homes.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor outlined his ``Renewing the Dream'' plan at
the new home of Oberrion Gibson, a 68-year-old grandmother who
earns less than $18,000 a year. The house was built with the
assistance of a nonprofit group that helps low-income families like
hers.
</P>
<P>
   With a 4.5 percent mortgage rate secured though a local
nonprofit group, Gibson recently moved into a new three-bedroom
home with her daughter and granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to be here,'' said the longtime resident of the Park
Hill neighborhood. Her previous, smaller home was torn down to make
room for the new dwelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a beautiful home, isn't it?'' Bush remarked.
</P>
<P>
   Although her home provided a suitable backdrop for Bush's
campaign appearance, Gibson wouldn't disclose her political
leanings nor commit to supporting Bush's GOP presidential bid. Even
so, Bush said it's people like Gibson he wants to help, ``not just
those who are entrepreneurs or who are at the top of the economic
ladder.``
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the American dream is to own your own home,'' Bush
said after a quick tour of the humble house and a moment of prayer
with its proud occupants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear this is a nest. It's part of her future as well as
her family's future. It's much easier to have that future when you
own something,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's proposal would extend the use of federal tax credits, now
limited to multi-family rental housing, to include single-family
homes for ownership. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Bush also has called for changes in the federal ``Section 8''
program that helps low-income renters. He said he wants to change
that program to turn renters into home buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Section 8 participant should be allowed to take his or her
stream of rental payments and convert that into a down payment and
mortgage payments,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he proposed giving banks a tax credit for matching a
person's savings if used for a home down payment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community is strengthened when there is a sense of
ownership. It makes the schools better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Bush's optimism, a spokesman for Vice President Al Gore
said his Republican foe's promises ring hollow because of
persistent housing woes in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is yet another issue where Bush has done nothing in Texas
but expects us to believe he'll be a leader as president. His
housing authority is under investigation by the FBI, and his
housing rhetoric should get the same kind of scrutiny from
voters,'' said Gore spokesman Douglas Hattaway.
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to federal and state investigations into the
Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs regarding
questionable lending practices. Two officials targeted by the probe
were appointed by Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Since he took office in January 1995, Bush said Texas home
ownership has increased from 59 percent to 63 percent, and in
1998-99, the state provided housing to 8,600 low-income people, a
200 percent increase over the previous two-year period.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush's housing proposal was his message of the day, he
also got a political boost when the Michigan state coordinator for
his former rival, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., endorsed him. State
Sen. John Schwarz said Bush can't ignore the McCain message that
made him the biggest vote-getter in the Michigan primary, where
Bush finished second.

<P>
   Last year, Our Lady Help of Christians, a Roman Catholic church
in Newton, Mass., was host to 155 baptisms, 110 funerals and more
weddings _ 96 _ than any other church in the Boston Archdiocese.
Add in the Masses, support-group sessions, prayer meetings and
school plays and scheduling becomes an administrative juggling act.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Mary Ellen Cocks, a pastoral associate who was sitting
at a 7:45 a.m. parish staff meeting recently, had reason for
distress when a colleague violated the sanctity of the schedule
book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not happy when I saw a 9 o'clock funeral written in
after we put in for a 9:30 rehearsal,'' she said sternly, sending
the hint of a glare across the conference-room table. Luckily, the
funeral reservation had been made for a contingency, not an actual
event, so she added, ``I'm just praying that nobody dies.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most of her colleagues at the table, Cocks is not ordained,
but she takes her job seriously. She is one of nine full-time,
nonclergy employees who run the business side of Our Lady's, as
parishioners call it.
</P>
<P>
   Churches are primarily houses of worship, of course, but they
are workplaces, too, and together they make up a pretty big
economic sector. The 352,000 full-time clergy in the United States,
for example, outnumber the nation's 266,000 psychologists and
310,000 bartenders. Add in all the lay people who work full-time or
part-time in churches, synagogues and mosques, from music directors
to secretaries and janitors, and the religious work force probably
surpasses a million.
</P>
<P>
   And to make all the religious events happen, they have to do
what people in any other businesses do: hold meetings, write
memorandums, resolve conflicts, plan budgets, meet deadlines, hire
and fire people and deal with grumpy bosses.
</P>
<P>
   As the early morning conference at Our Lady's shows, the
Catholic Church is responding to a worsening shortage of priests
and nuns by recruiting people from the secular world. More lay
people than seminarians are now seeking degrees in Catholic
ministry, said Scott Appleby, director of the Cushwa Center for the
Study of American Catholicism at the University of Notre Dame.
``It's very difficult to run a modern parish without a specialized
core of pastoral ministers,'' he said. ``Some will be business
managers and keep the books and worry about the physical plant.
Others will be specialists in religious education.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Walter Cuenin had two assistant priests when he came to
Our Lady's as pastor in 1993; now he has none. But his staff now
includes three pastoral associates; a business manager; an office
manager; a parish secretary; a principal to run the high school; a
director of religious education and another of youth ministry; two
custodians and a music director.
</P>
<P>
   In short, he never worries about whether there will be enough
processional candles. ``We're trying to model the way the church is
going to be, one priest with a whole group of lay people,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cuenin recruited Marie LaBollita, a nun, as a pastoral associate
six years ago, and a year later he enticed Cocks, who has 25 years
of experience in religious education, away from another parish.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Malloy, who became director of youth ministry five
years ago, said he knew from his first interview with Cuenin that
he could talk back, even when it came to church doctrine. ``You're
allowed to speak your mind,'' Malloy said. ``I don't see Walter or
Marie as different from the rest of us. That all fades away.''
</P>
<P>
   Like any good chief executive, Cuenin has learned how to
delegate authority. Cocks is in charge of the logistics for
baptisms and of liturgical planning, while LaBollita counsels
converts to Catholicism and ministers to the sick. Thomas Leahy,
the third pastoral associate, oversaw a four-year, $3 million
renovation of the 126-year-old church that was completed last year.
He points to a three-drawer file cabinet in his office that is
devoted solely to paperwork for the project.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining the church staff 16 years ago, Leahy worked as a
buyer for a department store chain until he became fed up with the
corporate bureaucracy. Now 70, he rarely complains about working
from 8 a.m. until 9:30 many nights. ``I've already had four
meetings this morning,'' he said as he took a break shortly after
10:30. ``But this is who I am, and this is my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuenin doesn't mind poring over the blueprints for the
redesigned parking lot or discussing whether there should be a
trumpeter at the 11:30 Mass. But with the little details taken care
of (``I don't have to be over there to make sure the microphones
are working,'' he said with satisfaction), he has focused on
increasing membership at the once-stagnant parish. To attract the
increasingly diverse parishioners, Masses are now said in Italian,
French and Spanish. (He speaks all three.) And in an ambitious
outreach program, the church has held 50 separate meetings with
small groups of parishioners since January.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts paid off. Close to 2,000 people attend one of the
four weekend Masses, a huge increase from four years ago that means
standing room only at some services.
</P>
<P>
   Collections are up sharply, enabling Our Lady's to absorb the
huge cost of hiring all that secular help. Unlike priests and nuns,
who take vows of celibacy and often live on church grounds, lay
workers have to worry about mortgage payments and their children's
college educations. ``It costs money, because you have to pay
people a living wage,'' Cuenin said. ``And I think a lot of
churches are not prepared for that yet.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't just the extra expense that gives some churches pause;
it is also the threat to tradition. It is no secret around Our
Lady's that the pastoral associates would like to take on duties
that are now the domain of the priests, like performing the
sacraments.
</P>
<P>
   Cocks flipped through her Liturgical Desk Calendar at a recent
meeting, looking for a vacancy at the baptismal font. ``I'm totally
filled for April, for May and for the first week of June,'' she
said. ``I was at lunch 45 minutes and when I got back there were
four more requests for baptisms.''
</P>
<P>
   She gave Cuenin a meaningful look. Another task for him. ``I
hate to do it Walter,'' she said with just a touch of sarcasm,
``but until they tell me I can do baptisms. ... ''

A CITY CHANGED FOREVER PAUSES TO REFLECT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: The spelling of Danney is correct.)  
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ Inside a hotel meeting room here, terrorism
experts from Israel, France, the United States and other countries
gathered on Tuesday to share information and ideas.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the meeting, a 71-year-old former small-town
newspaper publisher named Don Ferrell, admits he knows very little
about terrorism. But that is not the point. Ferrell does know the
price of terrorism: his daughter, Susan, was one of 168 people
killed five years ago in the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah
Federal Building, the worst act of domestic terrorism in the
nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   So when he was asked by survivors and victims' relatives to
become the chairman of the conference, he did not refuse.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the fifth anniversary of the blast, Ferrell will
attend the dedication of the Oklahoma City National Memorial, built
on the grounds of the destroyed Murrah building. President Clinton
is to speak, as is Attorney General Janet Reno, and Ferrell, a
retired National Guard general, admits that it will be difficult to
attend. But again he will not refuse. His reason, he says, is
simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we don't forget the ones we lost in there, that it
doesn't get to be a forgotten story,'' Ferrell said. ``That's my
hope.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ferrell, the bombing changed everything, much as it did for
Oklahoma City. Even now, as the city enjoys a civic renaissance
with a vast downtown refurbishment, the bombing has left a strange
blend of tragedy and pride. For so many years, Oklahoma hardly
resonated outside its borders. Now the lasting image of Oklahomans
responding in the hours and weeks after the bombing seems to have
transformed the way outsiders and natives alike regard the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``People turned on their television sets and saw something quite
extraordinary,'' said Gov. Frank Keating, who became a national
figure after the bombing. ``They saw a society that was better,
more spiritual, more professional, than they ever imagined.
Oklahomans' sense of themselves dramatically changed, practically
overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Even now, Keating says, people always ask about Oklahoma City
whenever he speaks outside the state.
</P>
<P>
   In the months after the bombing, visitors transformed a
chain-link fence beside the building into a shrine by leaving
thousands of notes, teddy bears, flowers and such. A smaller
section of the fence remains intact as part of the memorial, and
officials say people still visit day and night and still leave
mementos.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you asked most people now what they think of when they
think of Oklahoma, it's not `The Grapes of Wrath' anymore,'' said
Danney Goble, a professor of letters at the University of Oklahoma.
``They think of Oklahoma responding to the bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan to build a $29 million memorial was announced four
years ago by a 350-member task force appointed by Ron Norick, who
was then mayor. To some people then and now, it was too much. To
others then and now, there could never be enough. ``One thing I've
learned,'' Ferrell said, ``is everybody sees it differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Kari Watkins, executive director of the Oklahoma City National
Memorial Foundation, said her group was contracting to have the
National Park Service operate the memorial. There will also be a
museum in the adjacent Journal-Record Building, which was badly
damaged in the blast, though it will not be completed until later
this year. The Oklahoma City National Memorial Institute for the
Prevention of Terrorism, which has Ferrell as its chairman and
which was host of the antiterrorism meeting today, will also
eventually be housed in the building.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial itself covers 3.3 acres including the site of the
Murrah building. A rectangular reflecting pool extends where
Northwest Fifth Street once ran in front of the building. A field
of 168 empty stone chairs symbolizes the victims, while two 42-foot
bronze and concrete gates stand at opposite ends of the pool. One
is marked 9:01 a.m., the other 9:03 a.m.; the intent is to capture
the moment of the explosion, at 9:02.
</P>
<P>
   There are trees planted to honor the Oklahomans and others who
responded to the bombing, and there is an area dedicated to the
people who survived. Watkins estimated that between 300,000 and
500,000 people would visit every year.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, two days after her 24th birthday, Sarah Ice will
be among the first.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Paul Ice, a senior special agent for the Customs
Service, died in the bombing. A traumatized Ice left Oklahoma City
for the University of Washington, to give herself some distance.
But now she is back, a graduate student at Oklahoma City
University. Her tuition, in fact, is paid for by a fund established
by the governor for children of victims and survivors.
</P>
<P>
   She hopes the memorial will be something tangible that might
help prevent another such attack.
</P>
<P>
   And, she says, ``I don't want my dad to be forgotten.''

TO OUR OTHER OBSESSIONS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 23) 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What do we really talk about with our friends when we're not
discussing the vicissitudes of our personal lives? Why, popular
culture, of course! Much of the conversational glue that binds us
together comes from the stuff that wafts off television, movie and
computer screens, from our stereo speakers and headsets.
</P>
<P>
   It's an endless torrent of gossip and opinion filtered through
personal taste. The focus of conversation could be the Academy
Awards, a diva fest on VH1, a sports hero's latest feat, Oprah's
newest inspirational gambit, a Jerry Springer freak show or the
guys in 'N Sync.
</P>
<P>
   If we're honest with ourselves, these choices are crucial in
defining who we are. Like it or not, in a world ruled by television
chat and an increasingly interactive relationship with the media,
each of us is a walking market niche of opinions and choices ripe
for manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   But go to almost any Hollywood movie, and you'll find a strange
absence on screen of palaver about recordings, movies, television
shows and popular fiction. That's one reason that when a film comes
along that acknowledges the passions millions of us harbor about
favorite works of popular art, it can strike a deep chord of
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the best American movies released this year _ ``American
Psycho'' and ``High Fidelity'' _ show a bone-deep understanding of
how much of our emotional energy is invested in the consumption of
popular culture. Both movies recognize that to have a well-chosen
period pop soundtrack isn't enough anymore to lend a movie
credibility. A surefire bridge to identification with the
characters is to make them as opinionated about popular culture as
real people.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Psycho,'' a sleek, surreal horror-comedy set in the
late 1980s, wouldn't have the resonance it does without its
serial-killing protagonist's hilarious double-edged speeches about
the '80s hitmakers Phil Collins, Whitney Houston and, especially,
Huey Lewis and the News. Because his fulsome lectures on these
middle-of-the-road phenomena are preludes to murder, their music
and iconic status are profoundly implicated in the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Discoursing on Lewis and his group's recording career, the
movie's homicidal yuppie, Patrick Bateman, offers the sort of slick
assessment you might read in a pop record consumer guide. ``Their
early work was a little too New Wave for my taste,'' he sniffs
while getting ready to whack one of his Wall Street cronies. ``But
when `Sports' came out in 1983, I think they really came into their
own, commercially and artistically. The whole album has a clear,
crisp sound and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that
gives the songs a big boost.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick's lecture culminates in a gruesome ax murder during
which ``Hip to Be Square,'' a song he has just proclaimed the
group's ``undisputed masterpiece,'' becomes a heavily ironic theme.
Christian Bale's supercilious delivery subtly mocks a debased,
grandiose vocabulary of contemporary pop criticism (of movies and
television as well as music) that tosses around words like
``masterpiece'' as though they were penny stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Another implied joke is the ludicrous notion that a
squeaky-clean pop anthem like ``Hip to Be Square'' could incite
murder. The 1980s were the decade, if you recall, when the
Christian Right frothed at the mouth about the supposed
relationship between heavy-metal rock and satanic cults. The
paranoia became so acute that some records were played backward to
determine if they contained the cryptic ``backward masking'' of
Satanic messages.
</P>
<P>
   Pop music fanaticism is also the subject of ``High Fidelity,''
Stephen Frears' wonderful screen translation of Nick Hornby's
best-selling 1995 novel about the problematic love life of Rob
Gordon (John Cusack), a London record store manager.
</P>
<P>
   The relocation of the novel from London to Chicago without a
serious loss of credibility only illustrates the pervasiveness of
the pop fanaticism the movie describes. Anyone who grew up
devouring the pop charts can identify with the way Rob sees
everything in his life, including failed love affairs, as fodder
for top-five lists.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond Rob's mania for rankings, what makes the character so
sympathetic is the way Rob's personal hit parades become the
imaginary soundtrack to his fantasy life, lending his day-to-day
existence a secret rock 'n' roll grandeur. If his pop passions are
more extreme than most people's, it's only by a matter of degree.
</P>
<P>
   For many of us who grew up with rock, our personal musical
tastes weren't casual consumer choices but assertions of identity.
How many of us, like Rob and his record-store cronies, judge other
people based on their tastes in movies, music and celebrities?
</P>
<P>
   But until recently, it's amazing how few movie directors have
acknowledged the degree to which people talk about such things.
Martin Scorsese is one who knows, and Woody Allen (with his 1940s-
and '50s-schooled high cultural tastes) another. But it wasn't
until Quentin Tarantino laid his cards on the table in ``Reservoir
Dogs,'' with its brilliant, crazy riff on Madonna, and ``Pulp
Fiction,'' with its nightclub of celebrity impersonators, that the
walls began to crumble.
</P>
<P>
   So why has Hollywood not really gotten the message? One reason
may be competition between movies and other popular art forms.
Filmmakers cringe reflexively at crediting any other form with
matching film's emotional clout. Another reason may be the short
shelf-life of pop culture.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Hollywood still likes to imagine its dream world as larger
than television's ``reality'' and deeper than pop music's
trendiness. But as the forms of entertainment meld into a giant
blob of interactive, interdependent everything, such thinking seems
increasingly delusional.

THE LATEST SOUNDTRACK TO SPRING  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 23) 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Please note subslug for SEXY-SPRING-SONGS)  
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you were locked in an underground cave, with no sunlight,
clock or DSL lines, and the sole contact you had with the outside
world was a radio that could receive only Casey Kasem's ``American
Top 40'' countdown, how would you know what time of year it was?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is anatomical. As the seasons change, so too do the
fortunes of the booty song _ that fast-jiggling, salacious ode to
the gluteus maximus _ on the pop charts. In the winter, ``Thong
Song,'' a celebration of glimpses of scanty female underwear by
Sisqo of the rhythm-and-blues group Dru Hill, was bubbling well
under the Top 40.
</P>
<P>
   But by last week, with spring love in the air and spring break
on the beach, it was up at No. 5 and still climbing. Its
infectiously inane catch phrase, ``Let me see that
thong-tha-thong-thong-thong,'' has slowly become ubiquitous in
clubs, on the radio, on MTV and blasting out of cars, replacing
last year's bouncing booty hook extraordinaire, ``Back That Thang
Up'' by the New Orleans rapper Juvenile.
</P>
<P>
   In the pop charts, summer is generally the time of the light,
frothy single _ fun, catchy and laid back like ``Steal My
Sunshine'' by Len or ``Summer Girls'' by LFO. Fall is when the
superstars come out to play, setting up their albums for Christmas
shopping season with slick blockbuster hits. Winter is when record
companies bring their new bands out of the workshop, hoping that
with superstar season over, there is less to stand in the way of a
fresh face becoming the next big thing. And spring is booty time, a
soundtrack to the streets, in which pale wintry flesh is first
being exposed to direct sunlight, turning a young person's idle
thoughts to fancy.
</P>
<P>
   Soundtracks to spring lust are nothing new, of course. The booty
historian could trace the genre back to medieval maypole dances or,
in modernist times, Stravinsky's ``Rite of Spring.'' The latter not
only depicts the primitive fertility rituals at the root of today's
spring singles but also uses music more dependent on rhythm than
melody, with the fast-driving string ostinatos and emphatic
percussive downbeats that are at the core of Sisqo's ``Thong
Song.''
</P>
<P>
   With more recent origins in styles that have flowered in warm,
beach climates _ specifically, Jamaican dancehall and Miami bass _
modern booty music has been an incredibly inventive genre. Every
year, singers come up with new ways to say the exact same thing. In
the spring of '92, Sir Mix-a-Lot's ``Baby Got Back'' began moving
up the pop charts, chased later by Duice's ode to short shorts,
``Dazzey Duks.''
</P>
<P>
   And who could forget the great booty battle of spring '93, when
two nearly identical booty songs went to war for pop dominance: Tag
Team's ``Whoomp! (There It Is)'' and 95 South's ``Whoot, There It
Is.'' Since then, the charts have been filled with everything from
the 69 Boyz's ``Tootsee Roll'' to Hammer's ``Pumps and a Bump'' to
Freak Nasty's ``Da Dip.''
</P>
<P>
   It is strange that in a culture in which men disembody women in
any variety of ways _ fetishizing legs, breasts, backsides, even
hair color _ only one anatomical part has consistently dominated
the pop charts. Sir Mix-a-Lot's mammary catcall, ``Put 'Em on the
Glass'' experienced nothing near the success of his ode to babies
with back.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, though there are exceptions, there is no
consistently successful genre of female song objectifying the male
body _ despite the wealth of material to be found in protruding
pectoral muscles, six-pack abdomens, soccer-player legs, tight
backsides and the bulge in the pants known as the package.
</P>
<P>
   The pop-chart equivalent for female singers is the ode to the
bulges in men's pockets. This spring, as shallow men have been
booty-watching, single-minded women have been gold-digging.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the year's best singles are about this: Destiny's Child's
``Bills, Bills, Bills,'' in which suitors are asked to pay an
itemized list of the group's bills, and Missy (Misdemeanor)
Elliott's ``Hot Boyz,'' in which she announces the availability of
herself and her friends to men with ``the platinum Visas'' and
``the Benz jeeps and the Lincoln jeeps, nothing cheaper.''
</P>
<P>
   As traditional as the booty song, this popular obsession (still
in part a male fantasy because the lyrics were often written by
men) stretches from Massenet's ``Manon'' to Marilyn Monroe's
``Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend'' to Madonna's ``Material
Girl,'' a spring single itself.
</P>
<P>
   In a contrived attempt to bridge the gender gap, Sisqo begins
``Thong Song'' with a short spoken introduction that posits the
song as a public service announcement for women, teaching them what
men really think about (as if they didn't know). From there, the
song mimics half a dozen current trends in urban music, including
the mock-classical string samples that Dr. Dre has used to engineer
his comeback, the rhythmic stutter of a Roland drum machine
shaker-sound preferred by Swizz Beats and Timbaland and the
nonsense chants used for counterpoint in recent hits by JT Money
and Jah Rule.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Thong Song'' these devices lack the clarity, immediacy and
sharpness of impeccable producers like Dr. Dre and Timbaland, but
they work, which is all that matters in the realm of a spring hit.
</P>
<P>
   By definition, the booty song is rarely innovative (its use of
synonyms, metaphor and slang notwithstanding): it reinforces the
status quo. The few lyrics of ``Thong Song'' seem hastily written,
quoting Ricky Martin's ``Livin' la Vida Loca.'' The only line that
doesn't rhyme in the song's verse, the reference to Martin, is
another shortcut to increase the song's easy familiarity. The line
before it sells the song to a general audience: ``Not just urban,
she likes her pop.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of ``Thong Song'' goes something like this: ``She had
dumps like a truck-truck, truck/Thighs like what-what what.'' Then
Sisqo begs, ``Let me sing it again.'' And we let him sing it again,
over and over, everywhere we go. In fact, it seems like Sisqo has
no intention of ever stopping. He plans to release a new mix of
``Thong Song'' in July with a naughty rap from Foxy Brown and a
video that promises even more thongs, cranking up the heat on a
spring song to turn it into a summer anthem.

U.N. RIGHTS GROUP FOILS U.S. EFFORT TO CONDEMN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS to correct time element in 6th graf; Tuesday is correct) 
(Eds., skedded on some NYT budgets as CHINA-U.N.-RIGHTS) 
 By JANE PERLEZ

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an embarrassing defeat for the Clinton
administration, the major United Nations human rights body voted in
Geneva on Tuesday not to act on a U.S. resolution criticizing
China's human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   The vote came after the State Department released one of its
most withering annual reports on human rights in China and after
the secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, made a rushed overnight
trip to Geneva from India last month to make an impassioned speech
to the group, the U.N. Commission on Human Rights. It was the first
appearance by a secretary of state before the body, officials have
said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission voted 22-18 to back a Chinese motion for no
action on the U.S.-sponsored resolution; 12 nations abstained. In
effect, Tuesday's vote prevented discussion on the substance of the
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department made an extra effort this year to have
China's human rights practices condemned in what has become an
annual test of Washington's desire to criticize Beijing. The
resolution also failed last year, but the United States committed
less lobbying power then.
</P>
<P>
   By announcing its intention in January to sponsor a critical
resolution, much earlier than usual, the administration signaled to
Congress that it was paying as much attention to rights abuses in
China as to Beijing's desired entry into the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House on Tuesday, a spokesman for the National
Security Council, P.J. Crowley, said the administration was
disappointed. He noted that the vote on Tuesday was closer _ a
difference of four votes, rather than five last year.
</P>
<P>
   In Geneva, where the assistant secretary for human rights,
Harold H. Koh, led the lobbying campaign among delegates, he tried
to put a positive face on the vote. ``The basic message we sent to
the Chinese was that the United States will stand up for the
Chinese people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the senior Chinese official at the vote on Tuesday,
Qiao Zonghuai, denounced the resolution as ``an anti-China
political farce directed by the United States alone.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's human rights report this year described
China's ``poor human rights record'' as having ``deteriorated
markedly'' throughout 1999 and specifically referred to actions
against Falun Gong, the spiritual movement whose top leaders were
sentenced to long terms in prison in December.
</P>
<P>
   The report also cited Beijing's ``extremely limited tolerance of
public dissent aimed at the government, fear of unrest and the
limited scope or inadequate implementation of laws protecting basic
freedoms.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution itself rebuked China for ``severe measures taken
to restrict the peaceful activities'' of Buddhists, Moslems,
Christians and the Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
   The Beijing government takes the 53-member U.N. human rights
body seriously and has worked hard in the past several years to
thwart Washington's efforts to criticize its record in such a
public forum.
</P>
<P>
   In assessing Tuesday's defeat for the administration, the
executive director of Human Rights Watch, Ken Roth, applauded the
State Department's efforts but said they were not adequately backed
by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``This never became a White House issue,'' Roth said. In
response, an administration official said the National Security
Adviser, Sandy Berger, had brought the issue up with counterparts
in other countries.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In reviewing the vote, Roth said it was clear that among
countries that abstained there were at least seven that could have
been persuaded, with a White House campaign, to vote in favor of
the United States. Among those he cited were South Korea, Rwanda,
Argentina, Ecuador and Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Four votes needed to be changed from abstentions into votes
against the Chinese motion for a substantive discussion on the U.S.
resolution to move ahead. A tie would have allowed discussions at
the commission to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   In preparing for the vote Tuesday, the State Department was
publicly upbeat. Koh told reporters last month that Washington had
the ``best chance since 1995'' to defeat the Chinese motion to
block discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Koh commended Albright, at the time, saying that she was ``more
committed to the issues of democracy, human rights and labor than
anyone I've known.'' He added, ``She is the leader of our team, and
she is in charge of putting forward and advancing our entire
commission agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   But behind the scenes, the State Department had a fairly
difficult task. Their prime goal was to persuade the European Union
to co-sponsor the resolution with Washington, to put up a more
united front against the Chinese and to encourage smaller countries
to stand up to the concerted efforts of Beijing to block the
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   According to an account by a State Department official of
Washington's efforts to build unity within the European Union,
France and Belgium remained holdouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The European Union adopted a sub-optimal approach _ that they
would vote with us on the no-action but wouldn't co-sponsor,'' the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the European Union was against the Chinese motion to
block discussion.
</P>
<P>
   But the official acknowledged that leaders of those European
Union countries in favor of co-sponsoring the resolution, including
Britain, did not go out of their way to lobby other countries for
sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The European Union's commitments on these human rights issues
are concerned with how their relationship plays with Beijing,'' the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   In its efforts to get co-sponsorship, the United States
encountered a recently developed tactic of the Beijing government
in which China offers countries ``dialogue not confrontation.''
Under this rubric, China holds closed door meetings with
governments who say they are concerned about Beijing's rights
record.
</P>
<P>
   Australia and Canada are among those that conduct such a
dialogue with China. Neither co-sponsored the U.S. resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The United States also held a human rights dialogue with the
Chinese in 1999 but the Chinese canceled the dialogue for 2000 _ a
visit by Chinese officials to meet with administration officials _
after the bombing of their Belgrade embassy during the Kosovo war.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the year of the summit between the Chinese leader,
Jiang Zemin and President Clinton, Washington did not submit a
resolution to the human rights commission, saying there were
improvements in the record.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the United States succeeded for the only time in
defeating the Chinese government's procedural vote to block
discussion.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Edgard Varese and Olivier Messiaen were born 25 years apart, in
1883 and 1908, but many accidents brought them together. Since
Varese started out late on his public career and Messiaen early,
they both made their beginnings as composers in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   They both spent formative years in southern France, both studied
in Paris and were both indelibly influenced by the music they heard
there, especially Debussy's orchestral works and the early ballets
of Stravinsky. Both were drawn to distant cultures, ancient and
exotic. Both loved the sounds of wind instruments and percussion.
</P>
<P>
   So it is altogether a happy circumstance that brings them
together next weekend at Carnegie Hall. On Friday evening Christoph
von Dohnanyi and the Cleveland Orchestra will present Varese's
``Ameriques,'' and on Saturday evening Seiji Ozawa and the Boston
Symphony will offer Messiaen's ``Turangalila Symphony,'' with the
excellent Pierre-Laurent Aimard in the important part for solo
piano.
</P>
<P>
   There is also an American connection between these works. Varese
began ``Ameriques'' shortly after he had settled in New York, in
1915, and Messiaen wrote ``Turangalila'' for Ozawa's orchestra
(which was then, in the late 40's, Serge Koussevitzky's, though the
first performance was conducted by Leonard Bernstein).
</P>
<P>
   Varese was an eager immigrant. Coming to the United States was,
for him, coming to the future, and no sooner was he off the boat
than he was giving interviews about the new electronic music he was
going to compose. Because technology still lagged behind
imagination, that had to wait.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Ameriques,'' scored for an enormous orchestra, pushes at
the limits of what instruments can produce in terms of intensity
and pitch, as if violins and oboes were striving to become electric
oscillators. It's a powerful and exciting score, and it offers a
portrait not only of the real America seen and heard by a newcomer
_ noise and speed on the streets, sirens and alarms _ but also of
Americas of the mind, journeys of discovery.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the work was completed, in 1921, Varese was living
on Sullivan Street in Manhattan, where he remained until his death,
more than 40 years later, apart from a return visit to Paris for
four years at the end of the '20s. During that time back in Paris
he could have come across Messiaen and his music, and though there
is no record of a direct encounter, the two composers were
certainly moving in the same circles.
</P>
<P>
   Both were impressed by the flamboyant color of the music
produced by another visitor from the Americas, Heitor Villa-Lobos,
and both were intrigued by a new invention: the electronic
instrument designed by Maurice Martenot and known as the ondes
martenot.
</P>
<P>
   Varese used its piercing high frequencies in his ``Ecuatorial,''
a Mayan chant he set for bass and orchestra in the early 1930s.
Messiaen used the ondes martenot in several scores, including
``Turangalila,'' where its unearthly sounds add sweetness, glow and
a voicelike quality to melodies from the violins, or combine with
the piano and tuned percussion to create an Indonesian-style
ensemble of chimes and resonances within the orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Though Messiaen lived all his life in France, he had a fondness
for the United States, came here often and, after ``Turangalila,''
wrote several more works for American places and performers:
``Meditations sur la Mystere de la Sainte Trinite'' for organ,
``Des Canyons aux Etoiles'' for piano and orchestra, and ``Eclairs
sur l'Au-Dela'' for orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as all these works loudly declared, what he liked about
America was not the street animation and sleek machinery that so
appealed to Varese but rather the visual splendor of the canyons
and deserts and the sounds to be heard there: wind and birdcalls.

 UNDATED: and birdcalls.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Turangalila,'' which he completed in 1948, before his first
journey across the Atlantic, as yet contains no knowledge of these
things, but its scenery is already _ and characteristically _
spacious and unspoiled. One movement evokes the wonder of the
heavens, another a garden in which two lovers are in each other's
arms, the whole 10-movement symphony being a gigantic love song.
</P>
<P>
   The city, where it appears in his music, is always the heavenly
Jerusalem. Not only was Messiaen a composer of the countryside _
traveling the world in pursuit of bird songs, which he would put
into the music he wrote, in the main, at his summer home beside a
lake at the foot of the French Alps _ but he was also expressly a
religious composer, whereas Varese, the urban artist, was an
atheist.
</P>
<P>
   So often, though, opposites will meet. The Christian and the
nonbeliever both felt the power of archaic sacredness: Varese wrote
music for the Mayas, and Messiaen composed a monumental threnody
for wind instruments, bells and gongs with images of colossal
Mediterranean and Mesoamerican temples stuck around his desk.
</P>
<P>
   Varese's last major concert piece, ``Deserts'' of 1954, was,
like part of Messiaen's ``Des Canyons aux Etoiles,'' an image of
the desert and of an emptiness that was as much spiritual as
physical. And two pieces written at almost the same time _
Messiaen's ``Sept Haikai'' of 1962 and the ``Nocturnal,'' on which
Varese was working in his last years _ both use violins to imitate
the mouth organ of Japanese court music.
</P>
<P>
   The two composers could evoke ancient civilizations partly
because their musical means were extensive but also because, fired
by Stravinsky's ``Sacre du Printemps,'' they had broken decisively
with the European classical-music culture from which they had come.
Pulse and a manifest rhythmic energy came to steer their music.
Continuity had to take place through abrupt cuts. Musical ideas
would have to be clear and self-sufficient, like signals: hence the
preference for wind and percussion sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, both ``Ameriques'' and ``Turangalila'' were written by
composers in their middle to late 30s, enjoying the flush of early
maturity. However much they may differ in their means, style and
subject matter, they stand side by side in their bounding
confidence and optimism.

COMMENTARY: NEVER ON SUNDAY, MONDAY OR ... 
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ We're trapped in the windmills of her mind.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution of the Elian case hinges on Janet Reno's inner
conflicts, her Waco flashbacks, and her post-traumatic-stress
syndrome from the Miami riots during her time as prosecutor there.
</P>
<P>
   In Waco, she gave in to her macho FBI guys and moved too soon,
too forcefully. So in Miami, she calls the shots and doesn't move
at all.
</P>
<P>
   The harder the attorney general tries to come to the rescue, the
more elusive the rescue becomes. The more compassionate she is, the
more endangered the object of her compassion. The tougher she
talks, the deeper the other side digs in.
</P>
<P>
   You can feel her loneliness. She's the president's least
favorite Cabinet member, charged with trying to enforce the law in
an administration that loves to skirt it.
</P>
<P>
   As in Waco, Bill Clinton is ducking behind the tall gal. He
could end the Elian muddle by simply picking up the phone. Instead
of partying and panhandling in Hollywood, he could grab the chance
to lead.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady casts herself as a defender of children. But
she's too busy actualizing her self-worth in New York to worry
about a real child's psyche being razed by a vengeful village.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Al Gore has outpandered even himself, he's lost
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Reno gets easily intimidated by worst-case scenarios. Highlight
reels of her disasters play in her head in an endless loop,
negating every option.
</P>
<P>
   She does not want to take Elian out of the house at night
because it would look heavy-handed. She does not want to take Elian
during the day or on weekends because the crowds would be too
boisterous. She does not want to take him in the rain, because he
would get wet. She does not want to take Elian at Miami's rush
hour, Marisleysis' medication hour or Uncle Lazaro's happy hour.
</P>
<P>
   She did not want to take Elian over Thanksgiving or Christmas.
Or in January because she was hoping his Cuban grandmothers could
reclaim him. Or in February because she wanted to let the Miami
relatives have their day in court.
</P>
<P>
   She did not want to take Elian in March because the Little
Havana crowds were getting unruly and she did not want to provoke
another riot. Even when Lazaro gave Diane Sawyer temporary custody
of Elian, Reno resisted the notion that the uncle might be
exploiting the boy.
</P>
<P>
   She did not want to take Elian in early April, because she
assumed Lazaro would hand the 6-year-old over voluntarily to his
father.
</P>
<P>
   She did not want to take Elian last Wednesday night, when she
met with the boy and his relatives at the nun's house in Miami
Beach, because she had given her word that she would wait for a
negotiated solution.
</P>
<P>
   She did not want to take Elian on Thursday, after the relatives
broke their word and scorned the 2 p.m. federal deadline to turn
him over, because she wanted the scofflaws to have another day in
court.
</P>
<P>
   She did not want to take Elian in the furious aftermath of the
coco loco family giving TV the ``Papa don't preach'' videotape _
widely deemed abusive _ because she said she never saw the tape.
</P>
<P>
   She did not want to take Elian on Sunday, after lawyers for the
Miami relatives demonized the boy's father with unsubstantiated
smears, because she was still waiting for the appeals court
decision.
</P>
<P>
   She did not want to take Elian after ``60 Minutes,'' on which
Dan Rather gave the father a ``man-to-man'' challenge to weep over
the hostage videotape, because she never saw the tape.
</P>
<P>
   She did not want to take Elian on Tuesday, after a pediatrician
engaged by the INS warned her in a letter that ``Elian Gonzalez is
now in a state of imminent danger to his physical and emotional
well-being in a home that I consider to be psychologically
abusive,'' because she thought the situation was too confused.
</P>
<P>
   She does not want to take Elian this week because there was some
bad karma attached to the anniversaries of Waco, the Bay of Pigs,
Oklahoma City and Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   She does not want to take Elian on Sunday because it's Easter.
Then comes Earth Day, Arbor Day, the NBA playoffs and Cinco de
Mayo.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Father's Day. Weather permitting. (BOX)

VIETNAM TODAY: FORGOTTEN IMAGES REVEAL THE WAR FROM THE COMMUNIST
SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This is a shortened version of BC-VIETNAM-PHOTOGRAPHERS-NYT,
which moved tonight; April 30 marks 25 years since the fall of
Saigon, and this is the second of several articles on Vietnam and
the war's legacy, there and in the United States. A special section
is available on The New York Times.Learning.Network:
www.nytimes.com/learning/saigon)

<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOI, Vietnam _ Bundled in two sweaters and a coat in his
chilly, tiny apartment, an old photographer described in sharp
detail his most cherished image of the war _ a young woman, bent
under her burden of supplies, laboring up a steep rock face on the
Ho Chi Minh trail.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody _ not even the photographer, Dinh Dang Dinh _ has ever
seen that picture. After three months on the trail in 1974, all his
film, 80 rolls of it, was destroyed in an attack by a U.S. F-4
Phantom jet.
</P>
<P>
   Streamers of exposed film fluttered from a treetop, said Dinh,
who is now 80. His first impulse was to photograph the destruction,
but that is another image that remains only in his memory. All his
cameras were destroyed in the attack as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't sleep for a month, it was so awful,'' he said.
``Sometimes I still can't sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Many thousands of other photographs do survive from a corps of
photographers who recorded the war on the communist side, both in
North and South Vietnam. But these pictures are as little known
outside Vietnam as the long-gone work of Dinh.
</P>
<P>
   Now, decades later, a selection of those photographs is being
gathered by two U.S. researchers who have dug through government
archives and tracked down a dozen of the aged photographers who
risked their lives to take them.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years after the fighting ended, something surprising
is emerging: a new visual record of the war whose images had once
seemed so familiar.
</P>
<P>
   They are pictures of battle and of daily life from the other
side _ of barefoot guerrillas attacking a tank, of an outdoor
operating theater in a swamp, of children studying in a bomb
shelter, of a young soldier smiling brilliantly at the camera
moments before he was killed in a bombing raid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've printed hundreds of these from the original negatives,''
said one of the researchers, Doug Niven, who is preparing a book
along with his associate, Chris Riley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys would just bring us plastic bags full of negatives,
and we'd just hold them up to a loop and go through them,'' Niven
said. ``Some of them are as good as the most famous photographers
on the Western side. But they've been in the shadows for 25
years.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent interviews in Hanoi and in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly
Saigon, seven of the photographers recalled their work and what
they said were the most intense and rewarding years of their lives.
They photographed the war, they said, with the same nationalist
fervor as their comrades, the soldiers. They include:
</P>
<P>
   Doan Cong Tinh, 57, a tough combat photographer who spent more
than two years living under fire in Quang Tri, capturing some of
the most dramatic battlefield pictures from the northern side. He
said he had carried a firearm as well as his camera and used both
of them.
</P>
<P>
   Le Minh Truong, 70, who took up photography after he was wounded
fighting the French in the 1950s, then discovered beauty everywhere
he looked, in the flare of napalm or the contrails of U.S.
warplanes in the rubble of Hanoi or the silhouettes of jungle
fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Mai Nam, 69, whose picture of a U.S. bomber tumbling through the
sky, a parachute floating nearby, was reproduced as a postcard by
the government with the caption, ``Happy New Year 1967.'' When
peace came, he became a pioneer in photographing beauty pageants in
communist Vietnam, and his walls are now adorned by pictures, not
of war, but of beautiful women.

   Nguyen Dinh Uu, 82, who took his first pictures in 1948 when he
helped capture a unit of French soldiers and then turned their own
camera on them. ``Oh, I was so happy,'' he said, recalling the day
he first held a camera in his hands. ``We were more alive in
wartime, working in the border between life and death.''
</P>
<P>
   Lam Tan Tai, 65, a master of battlefield photo-processing, who
carried his chemicals with him, built little earthen darkrooms and
hung his negatives on the bushes to dry.
</P>
<P>
   And Duong Thanh Phong, 61, who spent the war documenting life in
the hidden tunnels of Cu Chi, just south of Saigon. Then, in the
greatest thrill of his life, he photographed the final day of the
war, April 30, 1975, as victorious guerrillas and their supporters
surged toward the South's capital with flags and guns and laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Those pictures of victory are a revealing counterpart to the
familiar scenes of terrified Vietnamese in Saigon fighting their
way onto evacuation helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Today, most of these photographers are little known even in
their own country. Much of their wartime work has been uncollected
and unused since its original publication decades ago in Vietnamese
and some foreign communist newspapers. Some has never been
published, and some of the photographers have little left besides
the negatives they put aside for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has always been my dream to exhibit my pictures,'' Tinh
said. ``But as you know, the years after the war were very
difficult here and nobody had the money for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this is also because the government _ like the
photographers themselves _ viewed their work as part of the war
effort, a project that could be forgotten now that it had served
its purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The photographers acknowledged with pride that their pictures
were deliberately one-sided, that they were fighting as hard with
their cameras as the soldiers were with their guns.
</P>
<P>
   And for the most part, their wartime propaganda _ often stunning
to look at _ is as genuinely descriptive of the conflict as were
some of the great U.S. pictures of battlefield horror or anti-war
protests.

   MIAMI _ _ A pediatrician who is advising the U.S. government on
the Elian Gonzalez custody standoff said the 6-year-old was being
psychologically abused in the home of his Miami relatives and
should be immediately removed from the home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the child should be rescued,'' said the pediatrician,
Irwin Redlener, who helped the Immigration and Naturalization
Service pick the mental health experts who met last week with
Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Attorney General Janet Reno and Doris M.
Meissner, the head of the Immigration and Naturalization Services,
he wrote that Elian was being ``horrendously exploited in this
bizarre and destructive ambiance.''
</P>
<P>
   And the situation is worsening day by day, wrote Redlener, a
professor of pediatrics at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and
president and director of community pediatrics at the Children's
Hospital of Montefiore Medical Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Redlener, an unpaid adviser to the government, was especially
critical of a home video taped by the relatives last week and
broadcast by a Spanish language television station here, in which
Elian told his father that he did not want to go back with him to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The image of Elian, occasionally glancing off to the side as if
for approval or instructions, and sounding rehearsed, ``looked
exactly like what we might see in a hostage situation,'' Redlener
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for the boy's Miami relatives said the pediatrician,
as well as the mental health experts the government sent to meet
with Lazaro Gonzalez, never talked to the child.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Garcia-Pedrosa, one of the family's lawyers, said the
pediatrician's comments were ``absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, psychologists who were invited into the home by the
Miami family said that taking Elian from the home would traumatize
him.
</P>
<P>
   But Redlener wrote that the situation is worsening for the boy
as standoff has become more vicious and heated.
</P>
<P>
   Around the country, other experts on pediatric medicine and
mental health agreed that the emotionally charged situation is
destructive to the child. But in Miami, Redlener's letter was
denounced by the Cuban Pediatric Society in exile.
</P>
<P>
   Redlener's letter came as both sides in this case waited for a
ruling from the 11th U.S. Circuit Cort of Appeals in Atlanta on an
emergency stay that would keep Elian in the United States until a
full hearing of an appeal of his case on May 11.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the Elian saga became even stranger. Mayor Joe
Carollo of Miami traveled to Washington to accuse Cuban diplomats
there of beating Cuban American protesters who had demonstrated
outside the Cuban Interests Section last week.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators said they were attacked by several men from
inside the Interests Section, who beat and kicked them. Carollo
said Reno promised him that she would investigate the incident.

IN THIS WASHINGTON, NO `SEATTLE' IS FOUND, BY POLICE OR PROTESTERS 
BY JOHN KIFNER  
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the end, Washington was not Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the credit for avoiding the chaos and violence of last
fall's demonstrations against the World Trade Organization is being
claimed by the capital's Metropolitan Police, and particularly
their seemingly ubiquitous chief, Charles H. Ramsey. The police
formed an impenetrable perimeter around the buildings housing the
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, the objects of
energetic protests over the last two days.
</P>
<P>
   But free to roam the streets outside the police barricades, the
vast majority of demonstrators, too, were determined to avoid
violence. They marched almost at will through the center of the
city, chanting, ``More world, less bank,'' but there were no
window-smashing rampages like those by anarchists in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   As the demonstrations ended, both sides claimed a kind of
victory and even a certain grudging mutual respect. The police had
enabled the financial meetings to go on, and the city had emerged
unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters from the Mobilization for Social Justice rejoiced
that their once-obscure objections to international monetary policy
were now on the front pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a win-win for everybody,'' Ramsey said in an interview
Tuesday. ``The bank was able to meet. The protesters were able to
express their views and exercise their First Amendment rights, and
we were able to maintain peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to keep ourselves from being the issue,'' he said
of the police. ``That's a very thin line to walk.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were complaints Tuesday from protesters that those
arrested had been held handcuffed for hours on buses and, along
with many of those in jail, had been denied food and water. There
were also complaints that bystanders, tourists, local businessmen
and a Washington Post photographer had been swept up in the arrests
of 600 people on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey was everywhere, appearing at the barricades at every
intersection leading to the bank, chatting with the protesters on
one side of the fences, patting his officers on the shoulders on
the other. He even wrestled some of the more determined protesters
to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   In one scuffle on Monday morning, someone pulled the four stars
from his left epaulet and made off with them, perhaps the most
serious assault on authority of the whole affair. Hours later, he
was at a barricade clutching a red rose given to him by a protester
as lengthy negotiations with a young woman dressed as a tree
defused a confrontation. It was agreed that the police would doff
their gas masks and open a small gap in their barricade so
protesters could be arrested peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the police strategy was surrounding and closing off a
large area around the bank's headquarters. Then they began picking
up the world finance ministers and other delegates as early as 5
a.m., shuttling them from their hotels under guard.
</P>
<P>
   This was in sharp contrast to Seattle, where the police did not
establish a protected zone. The demonstrators, instead, established
control over the routes to the meetings. Then the police tried to
move them with gas and billy clubs in violence that quickly spread
into street fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed at televised images from Seattle, the police and other
officials here spent months preparing, spending $1 million on gear
that made officers resemble Darth Vader, which protesters mocked by
blaring a ``Star Wars'' theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were organized, they had tactics we hadn't seen,'' Ramsey
said of the protesters. ``Our people did a good job of planning and
maintaining discipline.''

MCCAIN TO EXPRESS REGRET OVER SILENCE ON S.C. FLAG ISSUE
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: no byline) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain of Arizona is expected to tell
South Carolinians on Wednesday that the state should remove the
Confederate battle flag from over its Statehouse and that he should
have said so during the primary campaign there, Republicans who
have been briefed on the event said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans said that in an address in the South Carolina
capital, Columbia, McCain would concede that he made a mistake in
January when, in courting the state's conservative voters, he said
at one point that the flag was a ``symbol of heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights groups have fought for removal of the flag, which
was first erected by segregationists at the height of the civil
rights movement. The flag's supporters call it a symbol of
heritage, not racism, arguing that the Civil War was over states'
rights, not slavery.
</P>
<P>
   The flag became a volatile issue during the primary. McCain's
new position could put pressure on Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, to
alter his position that it was a matter for South Carolina to
decide.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush was asked Tuesday about McCain's expected statement,
he said: ``I believed the people of South Carolina should best
solve this issue. I still believe that. And I believe they will.''
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, McCain made conflicting comments about the
flag.
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview in January, McCain said he considered
it ``offensive'' and a ``symbol of racism and slavery.'' The next
day, in a statement distributed to South Carolina reporters, he
reversed himself and called the flag ``a symbol of heritage.''
Aides said he had misspoken in the television interview.
</P>
<P>
   Then the next day, in an interview in New Hampshire, which was
about to hold its primary, McCain reversed himself again, saying
that if he said he saw the flag as a symbol of heritage, he had
misspoken.
</P>
<P>
   ``My forefathers fought under the Confederate flag,'' McCain
said. ``I believe that they believed their service was honorable.''

NO ENVIRONMENTAL CAUSES FOUND FOR AUTISM IN NEW JERSEY TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARIA NEWMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the first study in the country on the incidence of autism
among young children, the Centers for Disease Control confirmed
Tuesday that there was a striking number of autism cases in Brick
Township, N.J., but found no link between the disorder and
environmental factors in the town.
</P>
<P>
   Agency officials, who traveled to Brick Tuesday to report the
findings of their yearlong investigation, also said that, while
there were no other studies in the United States with which to
compare their results, the overall prevalence of autism in the
country might be higher than previously believed.
</P>
<P>
   The study in Brick Township, prompted by the suspicions of one
couple with two autistic children who noticed many other autistic
children in their community, found a rate of 4 children with autism
per 1,000 between the ages of 3 and 10. In the of 72,000 people, 36
children are autistic, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   Some studies in Europe and Asia have indicated that as many as 2
of every 1,000 children have some type of autism, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rates are higher than we previously thought in this
country, and nationwide, they may be more in line with what we
found in Brick,'' said Jacquelyn Bertrand, who headed the study.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC's objectives were to verify the number of cases of
autism in Brick among the children who lived there during 1998 and
to examine whether the disorder was linked to chemicals in the
township's drinking water, its former landfill and the Metedeconk
River, where some residents swim.
</P>
<P>
   It found no such link. But the number of cases found surprised
some people involved in autism research.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CDC's findings are astonishing,'' said Dr. Eric London,
vice president of medical affairs for the National Alliance for
Autism Research in Princeton, which funds autism research.
</P>
<P>
   Autism is a disorder that affects a child's ability to
communicate and function socially. It varies in severity and has no
known cause and no cure.
</P>
<P>
   The study did not confirm the presence of a ``cluster'' of
autism cases, a term used by those who have tried to link high
cases of a disorder or disease, such as cancers, to a geographic
location and its environment. But, London said, the study in Brick
might indicate there may be more autism cases nationwide than
anyone previously believed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that we simply do not have enough data to
determine the prevalence of autism in this country,'' London said.
``We do not know if this is an unusually high number or if it is
representative of autism prevalence in the United States. Only
through additional research will we be able to evaluate the
strikingly high numbers found in Brick to determine if they
reflectthe population or if there are disparities in the rates in
different geographic areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Centers for Disease Control held public
meetings all day Tuesday at the Brick Township Municipal Building
to inform people of their findings. At an informal briefing Tuesday
night, 30 to 40 people milled about, looking at the yellow and blue
research graphics on easels or on the walls and asked questions of
officials who wore name tags.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the group were parents of autistic children who said
they were disappointed at the scope of the study, which was limited
to children who had lived there in one year.
</P>
<P>
   Sheryl and Bob Nichols of West Milford, in Northern New Jersey,
came to the meeting because they have a 9-year-old son who is
autistic. Nichols said she had contacted CDC officials to tell them
she had lived in Brick Township until she was 20 years old, before
she became pregnant with her son, but they did not include her in
the study because she did not fit into their parameters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think it has something to do with the environment,''
Nichols said. ``They just haven't found it. They didn't even
interview us.''
</P>
<P>
   The call for the study of Brick Township's problem began through
the actions of Bobbie and William Gallagher, who had two autistic
children and found that many other autistic children lived near
them.
</P>
<P>
   The Gallaghers, with the help of a few other parents of autistic
children, conducted their own rudimentary survey of the histories
of these children and became concerned about a possible link
between Brick Township's environment and the incidence of autistic
births.

SBC COMMUNICATIONS SUED BY WORKERS ON STOCK SALE

 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   California employees of SBC Communications, the nation's largest
local telephone company, sued the company Tuesday, accusing it of
costing 45,000 employees and retirees $1.1 billion by selling
shares of a lucrative investment that was in their
company-controlled retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   A group of 18 employees, retirees and spouses, who are seeking
class-action status for their suit, accused the company of selling
shares in AirTouch Communications from their 401(k) accounts after
a series of mergers made AirTouch an SBC competitor.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also accuses the company of giving out misleading
information so that its California workers would not know about an
unusual feature in their 401(k) plan that gave them the right to
keep shares of AirTouch by rolling the shares into Individual
Retirement Accounts while still at SBC. Typically, workers can move
401(k) funds to retirement accounts only if they leave their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   SBC, in a statement, expressed confidence that it had acted
lawfully at all times.
</P>
<P>
   The suit is by far the largest in a growing number of cases
involving possible conflicts between the self-interest of companies
in how they invest their workers' retirement money and their duty
under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act to operate the
plans ``solely in the interests of the participants and
beneficiaries and for the exclusive purpose of providing
benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   The case raises issues that can affect anyone whose employer
gives them, or lets them buy, company shares and then spins off
part of the company or is acquired by another concern.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles by Eli
Gottesdiener of the Sprenger &AMP; Lang law firm in Washington, centers
on AirTouch, which was the wireless telephone division of Pacific
Telesis until it was spun off in 1994. SBC employees received 11
million AirTouch shares in their 401(k) accounts as a stock
dividend at the time and, to retain the shares, employees had to
file statements saying they wanted to hold onto them.
</P>
<P>
   When SBC acquired Pacific Telesis in 1997, the Pacific Telesis
shares were converted to SBC shares, but the AirTouch shares were
not affected. Subsequently, the suit charges, SBC decided to sell
the AirTouch shares from the 401(k) accounts because the company
competed with SBC's own cell phone businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, several plaintiffs who do not know each other
said that when they asked Gail Roberts, an SBC 401(k) plan
administrator, to let them keep their shares she told them that SBC
did not want its workers owning shares in a competing company.
Roberts did not respond to voice mail messages Tuesday.

   The lead plaintiff in the case, Larry Gottlieb, 43, an installer
for 20 years with Pacific Bell, said he had fought to keep his
AirTouch shares because he was confident they would soar in value.
</P>
<P>
   Gottlieb said Roberts never told him of the provision that would
have let him keep his AirTouch shares, only that ``SBC does not
want a rival company's stock in their employees' 401(k) plan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very angry about this,'' said Gottlieb, who would have
$45,000 more in his retirement plan if he still had his 560
AirTouch shares. ``I told Gail Roberts that SBC had no right to
take my AirTouch shares. They were mine and no one else's to fool
around with as far as I am concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Resnick, 49, a psychologist in Orange, Calif., a plaintiff
who is a beneficiary of a 401(k) account of his wife, Adrienne,
said he, too, called Roberts and was told the AirTouch shares were
being sold for competitive reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said those are my wife's shares and you can't just sell them
and Roberts said, `Oh yes we can.'''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit asserts that when SBC began selling the AirTouch
shares, SBC management ``knew or should have known'' that their
value would rise because Bell Atlantic and Vodaphone were competing
to acquire AirTouch. Vodaphone won the bidding war and bought
AirTouch last June for $60 billion in cash and stock.
</P>
<P>
   The value of the AirTouch shares have tripled since they were
sold by SBC, the lawsuit says. Hourly workers' AirTouch shares were
replaced with SBC shares, which have since lost 16.6 percent of
their value. Management workers, whose AirTouch shares were sold at
a different time, have seen their SBC investment grow 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Several pension law experts said that SBC would have a problem
if the plaintiffs could prove it put corporate interests ahead of
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Not wanting workers to own stock in a competitor ``is not a
valid reason to force the sale of the AirTouch shares,'' said David
West, coordinator of the employee benefits practice at Gibson Dunn
&AMP; Crutcher, a Los Angeles law firm.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Stein, a pension law professor at the University of
Alabama law school, said, ``If the company was making decisions
based not on prudence but its business interests, they have a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Both lawyers said they could conceive of valid reasons not to
sell the workers' AirTouch shares, including an interest in having
employees hold diversified investments.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement, SBC said that it had not seen the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``However,'' the statement went on, ``our position on this issue
is very clear: no SBC savings plan includes direct stock ownership
in any other company that is not related to SBC. After acquiring
Pacific Telesis in 1997, SBC moved to bring the two companies'
savings plans in line with one another. After lengthy internal
review, including negotiations and agreement with our labor union,
and after months of prior notice, SBC gave management and
nonmanagement employees alike five different investment choices for
converting their AirTouch funds. All the money from the liquidated
AirTouch stock was reinvested dollar-for-dollar in these other
vehicles and SBC did not profit from the conversion.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Weitkamp, the Communications Workers of America district
director in Los Angeles, could not be reached last night to comment
on whether the union consented to the sale of the AirTouch shares. &QL;

A JOURNEY BEGUN IN OPERA CONTINUES IN SYMPHONY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 23) 
</HEADLINE>
   Matthew Gurewitsch writes about the arts for The Wall Street
Journal and other publications.  
 By MATTHEW GUREWITSCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Helsinki, Finland _ The crooked side road, the whispering pines,
the flagstone path: I have passed this way before. Snow was hanging
heavy on the branches then. Today, the first fragrant lilacs shiver
in icy breezes that slice like a knife.
</P>
<P>
   The Finnish composer Einojuhani Rautavaara, 71, stands framed in
the doorway, looking nothing like the solitary misanthrope of
legend, an icon of contentment: slightly stooped but tall, thick
dark hair mixed with gray, deep-set eyes sparkling in welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the first thing he shows me is his guest book, open to
the page I signed a dozen years ago, when I came by to hear about
``Thomas,'' his opera on a medieval Finnish bishop and firebrand.
Again, a pen lies ready. Our topic this time is his Symphony No. 8,
subtitled ``The Journey.''
</P>
<P>
   A centennial commission of the Philadelphia Orchestra, it
receives its premiere, conducted by Wolfgang Sawallisch, in
concerts beginning on Thursday at the orchestra's home, the Academy
of Music, with a repeat at Carnegie Hall on May 1.
</P>
<P>
   ```The Journey' isn't just a fancy title,'' Rautavaara says.
``The symphony uses material from a monologue in `Thomas.' The text
there goes: `This journey goes on, it never ends. It will never
end, never.''' (The words, as usual in Rautavaara's operas, are his
own.) ``I had to use that motif again, to write variations on it.''
</P>
<P>
   A Proustian procedure? ``This method has been with me from the
beginning. It's not that the material is so beautiful as such. I
don't quote a la Berlioz or Strauss. It's an organic phenomenon.
Something that was 19 measures in a choral piece turns into 40 or
50 measures in a violin concerto two years later. No one ever
notices. There are people you see every day _ they sell you bread
or cut your hair _ and on the street you don't recognize them.
Maybe they seem vaguely familiar.''
</P>
<P>
   Rautavaara's fluent, often jazzy English harks back to a spell a
half century ago at the Tanglewood Festival in Massachusetts, and
in New York, where he shared a room on 110th Street with a Puerto
Rican woman who taught him to trample ``las cucarachas''
flamenco-style. His American period came about thanks to Jean
Sibelius, whose 90th birthday the Koussevitzky Music Foundation had
decided to observe with a study grant to an aspiring composer of
the old man's choice.
</P>
<P>
   Rautavaara's first meeting with the glowering titan still lay in
the future. ``No one saw him,'' Rautavaara says. ``He was a mythic
monster.'' Yet in his solitude, Sibelius had got wind of
Rautavaara's ``Requiem in Our Time,'' which had won an
international prize in Cincinnati. Characteristically, that piece
had recycled a motif from a distinctly less successful effort, and
Rautavaara can still quote with relish the words of a forgotten
critic who deemed the earlier work a disaster: ``The young man has
to climb the tree from the top down.''
</P>
<P>
   The telegram announcing Rautavaara's unexpected turn of fortune
hangs upstairs, framed, in his study. It reached him at a run-down
palace in Vienna, where he and five Mexican pianists were renting
rooms from decayed nobility. In due course, he set sail for the new
world.
</P>
<P>
   His recollections of Aaron Copland, Vincent Persichetti and
Roger Sessions are affectionate and musically revealing. Copland
shocked him by referring to Schoenberg and Webern as ``the enemy.''
The youthful Rautavaara, later to study among the iconoclasts of
Cologne, was hungry for styles of all kinds. Before learning about
Messiaen's symmetrical scales from Persichetti, he had, on his own,
organized a piece around a theme that matched one of Messiaen's
scales precisely.
</P>
<P>
   That would have been in his ``young soldier'' or avant-garde
phase, preceding the phases of patriarch (upholder of values) and
recluse (or mystic): a threefold Brahminic template Rautavaara has
said he hoped to follow. Perhaps he has, though scarcely in a neat
sequence.
</P>
<P>
   In the composer's life and art, the past seems ever present. The
cult favorite ``Cantus Arcticus'' (recently performed in a Finnish
program by the Brooklyn Philharmonic) incorporates his own
laboriously assembled tapes of bird songs he heard in Lapland as a
child. His ``Sonette an Orpheus'' (Op. 9), an early cycle of Rilke
settings, is open on the piano.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vigilia,'' his majestic, richly varied all-night vigil ``in
memory of St. John the Baptist,'' composed in the early 1970s, is
woven from reminiscences of a boyhood visit to the island monastery
of Valamo in 1939, shortly before the death of his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the last chance to see it, because that year the winter
war broke out, and we lost that part of Finland to the Russians,''
Rautavaara says. ``Looking from the prow of the boat in the early
morning, I was rather bored, seeing only fog. Then the wind sprang
up, and suddenly I could see the towers, all red and gold, and the
bells started to ring, hundreds of bells of all sizes. I'd never
seen anything like the icons with the saints. My family was very
Lutheran, very ascetic. We stayed overnight. As I fell asleep, I
heard the monks' robes sweeping the floor. It all stayed in my
mind. The subconscious is the best friend a composer has.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rautavaara's music has been recorded on nearly 100 CDs, mostly
on the Finnish label Ondine. Many of his titles have a
transcendental aura, prompting at least one recent reviewer to
suspect the Finnish composer of ``climbing on the celestial
bandwagon'' alongside the likes of Arvo Part, John Tavener and
Henryk Gorecki. In fact, his sensibility _ even in ``Vigilia,'' so
self-evidently inspired by the music of the Eastern Orthodox Church
_ is quite distinct.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Part's music very much,'' Rautavaara says, going on to
pinpoint the difference. ``But his attitude is Oriental, monotonic.
I'm very much a European, Faustian. Extremes and contrasts are
important to me. European culture is built on polarity, which
creates great energy. That is why Western culture is still strong
and alive after 2,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understood this when I was in Rome for the first time and
saw the Moses of Michelangelo. I saw the statue as a symbol of
European culture, built from two cultures in complete contrast. One
source is Greek philosophy: very rational, very clear. The other is
the monotheism of the hallucinating Hebraic prophets. Writing
`Vigilia,' I asked myself: how can I write hours of music so people
don't die of boredom? Part would probably ask the opposite: how do
I make the music last forever?''
</P>
<P>
   A book by Kalevi Aho discusses Rautavaara's symphonies in the
Hegelian terms of thesis (Symphony No. 1), antithesis (No. 2) and
synthesis (No. 3), with the serial Fourth forming a fresh contrast
to the Third, and the Fifth a synthesis of the Third and the
Fourth. Does the composer accept that model? ``You can see it that
way,'' he allows.
</P>
<P>
   Rautavaara's conversation, so rational and cheerful, seems hard
to square with the chaotic, demonic strain so powerful in much of
his music. Where, I wonder, is the connection to the tormented
heroes of his major operas, Vincent van Gogh among them?
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting rid of a milieu that is not good for you, as Vincent
did, is very familiar to me,'' he replies. ``Once it was very
important to me to have gadgets, cars, villas as all Finns have,
dogs, a motorboat, a family, children: all very normal and comme il
faut, and all completely foreign from what I wanted to achieve. I
had to get rid of them, and I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Rid of his children?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have children from a previous marriage that was a hell of 20
years,'' he says. ``There are two boys. They're grown up and on
their own. I have nothing to do with them. Children are beautiful
at a distance of 10 meters, not to live with. Now I have an ideal
marriage. My second wife and I are children to each other.
Interviews are fun and nice but not important. If I had to choose
between being famous and having my music played all over the world,
or to go and write my music, I would choose the latter. My wife
will tell you: I write on Christmas Eve. This is the common thread
with the heroes of my operas.''
</P>
<P>
   He seems at peace, snuggled in a sweater, yet the room feels
frozen, full of ghosts. His father, dead before the winter war. His
mother, a physician called to the army, dead of exhaustion before
peace returned. A clutch of aunts who took him in and sent him
along, an orphan at 13. The aunt, another physician, who at length
adopted him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 17 years old, I read what Richard Strauss said,
that even in the war, he could still create small, private
universes of beauty,'' Rautavaara recalls. ``That was good enough
for me. In music, I found a private world where I was master. I
knew nothing. I went to a friend of my father's who taught theory
and asked him for lessons.'' Still a novice, he soon wound up at
the Sibelius Academy here, Finland's top conservatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some great pianists there, and I was a beginner,''
he says. ``People would look at me and say, `He's supposed to be a
composer, and he can't even play the piano.' It gave me complexes,
which are very important for any composer. They force you to
compensate. I say to friends with children: `Don't forget to give
them complexes. They need them.'''

 Margy Rochlin's most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was about
the actress Catherine Keener.  
 By MARGY ROCHLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When the writer and director Lisa Krueger was 19,
she fled to Paris and lived there for five years. What was she
escaping? Freedom. Namely, the kind engendered by being raised in
Berkeley, Calif., a university town famous for its love of radical
politics, social experimentation and A-to-Z religions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was soothed and relieved to live amongst such rational
people,'' said Krueger, who found the rigidity of French culture
the perfect antidote to America's prizing of individuality. ``Here,
anything is possible, you can completely invent yourself, be
whoever you want. But as a result, there's no anchor, no roots.
It's like your identity is up for grabs.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Krueger, 39, has made only two movies, but the longing
for structure is a central theme in both. Indeed, some of the most
touching moments in her 1996 indie debut ``Manny and Lo'' involve
watching how the lives of two underage orphan runaways (Scarlett
Johannsen and Aleska Palladino) are enriched when they kidnap a
discipline-driven woman (Mary Kay Place) and the three become a
makeshift family.
</P>
<P>
   As for Joline (Heather Graham), the nightclub manager heroine of
Krueger's latest film, ``Committed'' (opening Friday), she finds
comfort in structure, too. But her quest _ to save an unraveling
marriage by hunting down her wayward photojournalist husband, Carl
(Luke Wilson) _ comes at the expense of her happiness and,
eventually, her own sanity.
</P>
<P>
   During Joline's journey, which takes her from New York to a
particularly barren, sandswept corner of El Paso, Texas on the
border of Texas and Mexico, she relies on a battery of New Age
tracking devices that seem a mixture of spiritual intuition and
delirious improvisation. Once her stakeout is set up in El Paso,
her good-natured sense of purpose draws unlikely fans and
well-wishers, including her husband's new girlfriend (Patricia
Velasquez).
</P>
<P>
   In this way, ``Committed'' is a tale of post-feminist romance,
an almost anti-``First Wives Club,'' in which a jettisoned woman
does not feel victimized or vengeful, merely emboldened to save her
confused spouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know `it's better to give than receive' is one of the oldest
notions in the world,'' she said. ``But I feel like we've relegated
that idea to the furthest back burner. We're very intent on getting
what we deserve, getting what's ours. I see the pendulum swinging
the other way. Because this endless getting, getting, getting is an
empty goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding a leading lady who had comic timing and a flighty
charisma and could keep the audience invested in her fanciful
mission turned out to be one of Krueger's trickiest tasks. She
estimated that she admired, but had to write off, 90 percent of the
actresses she considered because they did not seem to have what the
role required.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at somebody like Ashley Judd, you can always see the
wheels turning,'' Krueger said. ``Blind faith is a hard thing to
pull off. I needed someone who would not think, just do.''
</P>
<P>
   In the wide-eyed Heather Graham, Krueger found herself the
perfect protagonist. Winningly optimistic and driven almost
entirely by intuition, there is something wholly believable about
Graham's Joline, particularly as she incessantly practices her
mystical rituals, some of which Graham invented under Krueger's
watchful guidance.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'd say, `Do some stuff with your hands,''' Graham said.
``And I'd, like, move my hands in a circle twice, then make a
square. Then she'd say: `No, I don't like that. Try patting twice.'
I'd try again. Then she'd go: `OK! Good!'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Incredibly approachable, supportive, a warm, loving person,
but at the same time tough, really demanding,'' is how Graham
categorized Krueger's style as a writer-director. And Graham knows
from writer-directors. In fact, she cavorted openly on the set with
one, her boyfriend, the filmmaker Ed Burns (``The Brothers
McMullen''), often blowing kisses to him and mouthing the words ``I
love you'' right before the cameras were to roll. The possibility
that her star's blissed-out state would add an unwanted love glow
to her portrayal of a character in emotional turmoil did not merely
cross Krueger's mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was flipped out, initially,'' said Krueger, who instead of
asking Graham to leave her floppy-haired distraction back in the
hotel room chose to adopt a wait-and-see strategy. ``I wanted to
make sure I was doing the right thing, to see if he was stifling
her. And he just wasn't. He was incredibly respectful. A boyfriend
with a capital `B.' Like, when she was cold, he'd wrap his arms
around her. So I thought, `Well, at least she's very happy.'''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, when it comes to the idiosyncrasies of the creative
process, Krueger has probably seen it all. During the early '90s,
after graduating from the University of California at Berkeley, she
found work as a script supervisor for Abel Ferrara, Jim Jarmusch
and James Ivory, independent directors with highly divergent
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   By definition, the script supervisor's job is about keeping
account of a movie's continuity and dialogue. The way Jarmusch
describess it, though, Krueger's specialty was also quirk
management.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID BARRON  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
Khalid Khannouchi, the Moroccan-born world-record holder in the
marathon, took another step Tuesday in his efforts to obtain U.S.
citizenship in time to compete for the United States in the Summer
Olympics.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Khannouchi, who has lived in the United States since 1993, met
here with his Houston attorney, Harry Gee, to provide fingerprint
information to Immigration and Naturalization Service officials.
</P>
<P>
   He then boarded a flight to Ireland, where he will recover from
a recent race and await word on whether his citizenship application
will be approved before the May 7 marathon trials in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Gee has said there was an 80 percent chance INS officials would
approve Khannouchi's application by May 3, four days before the
trials, ``but I'm feeling a much higher-percentage chance now,'' he
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (INS) have the information and material they need to
comply with the law and regulations. It's just a matter of
processing,'' Gee said. ``Having said that, you're always a little
hesitant. I never say that something is 100 percent. But I'm really
optimistic that this has a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Khannouchi, 28, came to the United States from Morocco in 1993
and married a naturalized American citizen, Sandra Inoa, in 1996.
He won the Chicago Marathon in 1997 and 1998, his first two races
at the distance, and in the 1999 Chicago Marathon last October set
the world record of 2 hours, 5 minutes, 42 seconds for the 26-mile,
385-yard distance.
</P>
<P>
   He was favored to win Sunday's London Marathon, his fourth race
at the distance, but finished third in 2:08:36, two minutes behind
winner Antonio Pinto of Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased with the training,'' he said. ``The competition
has been good so far except my last race was a third place, which I
didn't like, but that's life. I still consider myself a rookie in
the marathon. Each and every time I run is a learning experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (citizenship and a shot at the U.S. trials) would mean a
lot to me. I had a dream to come here and succeeded. I have a
better life. My second dream would be to go to the Olympics, and I
don't want to go as a spectator. I want to go and bring something
back for my country.''
</P>
<P>
   If the INS delays his application or if he is unable to recover
quickly from Sunday's race, he could try to qualify at 10,000
meters during the U.S. trials in July at Sacramento, Calif.,
assuming his application is granted by then.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential roadblock may come from the Moroccan athletic
federation, which could file a protest that would require him to
wait three years before representing the United States. Khannouchi
emigrated to the U.S. because of what he described as lack of
support by the federation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the (International) Olympic Committee gets involved, I
don't think that will be a problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Khannouchi struggled during his early years in the United States
and dropped out of a 1995 road race in Connecticut. His future
wife, who also dropped out of the race, gave him a ride back to New
York and offered to act as his coach and manager.
</P>
<P>
   He dumped his coach, former Olympic middle-distance champion
Said Aouita, and married Inoa, a former marathon record holder in
her native Dominican Republic and later a runner's agent, a year
later. She encouraged him to focus on the marathon, and he won his
debut race in Chicago in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Khannouchi applied for permanent residency status in 1996, two
months after his wedding, but the INS worker who interviewed him
never filed the paperwork, then was indicted and later convicted of
conspiracy, bribery and processing false documents. Although no
wrongdoing was involved in Khannouchi's case, his file was frozen
and his green card was not granted until September 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The normal waiting limit to become a U.S. citizen is three
years, which would rule him out for the 2000 Olympics, but the
couple found a loophole in INS regulations when Sandra Khannouchi
earlier this month began working for Elite Racing Inc., a U.S.
company that promotes racing overseas.
</P>
<P>
   INS regulations can provide expedited citizenship for spouses of
U.S. citizens who work overseas for an American company. The law
was used a month before the 1998 World Cup to obtain citizenship
for French defender David Regis, who was married to a U.S. citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Some U.S. track figures, such as former distance runner Marty
Liquori, have spoken out against Khannouchi's efforts, saying they
will discourage the development of U.S.-born runners. Others,
including former Olympic medalists Frank Shorter, Joan Benoit
Samuelson and Bill Rodgers, have supported him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some who don't like what I'm doing, and that
sometimes makes me mad,'' he said. ``I don't like to have enemies
or people who criticize me. What I'm trying to do is my best for
myself and the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   During his brief stop in Houston, Khannouchi had his
fingerprints recorded electronically, which should expedite a
records check by the FBI. Depending on INS action and his recovery
from the London race, he could return within a week to 10 days for
more meetings and, eventually, a citizenship swearing-in ceremony
in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   While the bureaucracy grinds on, Khannouchi remains noncommittal
regarding his status for the marathon trials. He said he has
suffered training injuries every time he has tried to run more than
one marathon a year.
</P>
<P>
   Track mavens have predicted that Khannouchi could perform at 90
percent of capacity and still qualify in the top three for the U.S.
team, but he remains cautious.

   Jarmusch was often amazed by how Krueger kept track of the lines
his eclectic ensemble casts were encouraged to ad-lib, as well as
the scenes he would be filming and the type of footage he would
need for editing. ``It was like having another eye,'' he said.
``She really understood how we were working.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivory was a stickler for delivering dialogue exactly as written.
During the making of `` and Bridge'' (1990), for example, Paul
Newman accidentally swapped the word ``which'' for ``that.'' Ivory
instructed Krueger to correct the Academy Award-winning legend. ``I
looked at Jim, like, `Do I have to?' And he smiled at me and said,
`It builds character.' And, in a weird way, it (italics)does(end
italics) build character because I learned to see the bigger
picture, to figure out how to tell somebody something technical
without ruining what was going on creatively.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Newman's response to the soft-spoken, slightly
built, earnest looking Krueger was, ``If you're lucky.'' Still, he
complied.
</P>
<P>
   ``She really has everybody on her team because she's so
incredibly diplomatic and endearing,'' said Tom Krueger. Krueger is
Krueger's younger brother and was the director of photography on
``Committed'' and ``Manny and Lo'' as well as ``Best Offer,'' an
award-winning short film Krueger wrote and directed in 1990 which
featured art direction by a third Krueger, brother Matthew. That
Catharine Krueger, the eldest of the four siblings, has temporarily
suspended her photojournalism career while she raises her family in
Texas must bring some comfort to the Krueger progenitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all of our parents' splendor and faults, we are here to
document it,'' said Tom Krueger, a writer and director whose work,
like his sister's, is laced with autobiographical touches. ``We
have so much raw material to choose from _ and not all of it puts
them in the best light. If they only knew they were going to have
four artists, two of them filmmakers to fully explore all of it on
the silver screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Krueger was born in St. Louis, Mo., but by the time she was 10
and the family was living in northern California, divorce and
upheaval had turned the Krueger clan into a two-city household. ``I
grew up in the first wave of parents discovering themselves,''
Krueger said about the split that sent her psychiatrist mother
packing to Berkeley while her orthopedic surgeon father remained in
Lucas Valley; both went on to remarry and build second families.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, I advocate this, but it left me with certain
question marks about what bonds and institutions really mean.
`Manny and Lo,' in a lot of ways, is about not knowing what family
is. `Committed' is about, `What does it mean to be married to
someone?'''
</P>
<P>
   When she made her exodus to Paris' 11th arrondissement she began
studying cinema at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes, teaching English at
the University of Paris and endlessly analyzing film, albeit in a
language that was not her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very exciting time, a real hotbed of critical
thought,'' said Krueger, who has no delusions about the
contributions she made to the debates held by her then-boyfriend,
the French film theoretician Raymond Bellour, and his equally
cerebral friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just this little pipsqueak, offering my opinions in bad
French,'' Krueger said. ``Now that I'm their age, I look back and
think they must have been unbelievably patient.''
</P>
<P>
   On the morning she relayed this bit of background, Krueger was
eating an oatmeal and fruit breakfast in a hotel coffee shop in
Santa Monica. These days, Krueger lives outside Kingston, N.Y.,
with Art Chandler, her husband of seven months.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a doctor,'' she said. ``And that's the amazing part.
After all these years, I've met somebody who does what my parents
do.'' For perhaps the fourth time in the span of an hour she
reached for her cappuccino, began following a train of thought and
set her coffee back down, forgetting to take a sip. And how did
that smear of what looked like hot cereal end up on the elbow of
her black sweater?
</P>
<P>
   Such tics of brainy preoccupation make her seem more like a
college professor than a battle-scarred indie filmmaker. Where's
the bitterness and frustration that's the specialty of her ilk?
``Well, I've been lucky,'' she said with a smile. ``I haven't hit
any walls yet. Or at least ones that are perceivable to me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I may get rageful some day,'' she added, apologetically.

DIALLO PARENTS SUE CITY AND OFFICERS OVER SON'S DEATH
</HEADLINE>
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The family of Amadou Diallo filed a civil lawsuit on
Tuesday against New York City and the four police officers who were
acquitted of criminal charges in his death.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed by Diallo's parents, Saikou Amadou Diallo and
Kadiatou Diallo, and an administrator of Diallo's estate, Stanley
S. Ostrau, focuses not just on the four officers' actions but also
on the culture and policies of the Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   It specifically points to the department's major expansion in
1997 of the Street Crime Unit, to which all four officers were
assigned, and to what it calls the unit's ``policy'' of racial
profiling as factors in the fatal police shooting. Diallo, an
unarmed street vendor and Guinean immigrant, was killed in a hail
of 41 bullets in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building on
Feb. 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department is considering whether to prosecute the
officers on federal civil rights charges, and lawyers for the
Diallos said they had hoped to wait until that decision was made
before filing suit. But under the state's statute of limitations,
civil suits must be filed within one year and 90 days after the
incident in question. That deadline is approaching.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Justice Department officials would say only that
their review was continuing. Gregory Longworth, a lawyer with
Worth, Longworth, Bamundo &AMP; London who is representing the four
officers in the civil proceedings, said he would seek a stay of the
suit until the Justice Department had made a determination.
Officials with the city corporation counsel's office would not
comment on the suit.
</P>
<P>
   In the suit, filed in State Supreme Court in the Bronx, the
Diallos are seeking $20 million from the city, as well as $41
million in punitive damages against the officers, Sean Carroll,
Edward McMellon, Richard Murphy and Kenneth Boss, who are accused
of using excessive force and acting under color of law to deny
Diallo's rights. While many such suits are settled out of court,
the family's lawyers have said they will consider using this one to
raise issues in court that they believe were not adequately raised
in the criminal trial.
</P>
<P>
   While the officers contended at their trial that Diallo had
behaved suspiciously, the suit says they approached him ``for no
other reason but that he was black.'' Carroll indicated at the
trial that he had stopped Diallo because he had resembled a sketch
of a serial rapist. Soon after the shooting of Diallo, the police
arrested another man, Isaac Jones, and said he was the serial
rapist. Jones went on trial this week in four Bronx rape cases; he
is charged in 13 others.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit accuses the Police Department of making a policy of
racial profiling by targeting black males for ``stop and frisk''
searches on the street. The department tacitly authorized unlawful
stops by the Street Crime Unit, the suit contends.
</P>
<P>
   According to the suit, the street stops have resulted in the
persistent violation of individuals' constitutional rights. The
suit states that blacks make up 25.6 percent of the New York City
population but that 62 percent of all people stopped by the Street
Crime Unit are black. In the period leading to Diallo's death, the
Street Crime Unit stopped about 16 black residents for every stop
that resulted in an arrest, the suit says.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the suit contends, the ``policy, practice and custom
of racial profiling, established, sanctioned and condoned by the
New York City Police Department, was a contributing cause'' of
Diallo's death.
</P>
<P>
   The officers were also acting in accordance with a mandate that
Street Crime Unit officers seize at least one illegal gun a month,
the suit alleges, and Police Commissioner Howard Safir's tripling
of the Street Crime Unit's size, to 380 officers from 120 in 1997,
resulted in ``grossly inadequate training'' and left the unit
``dangerously unsupervised.'' By assigning inadequately trained
officers to the unit, the suit says, the department ``evidenced
deliberate indifference'' to the rights of the people with whom the
unit had contact.

 Ted Loos' most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was about Hilary
Swank.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last winter, the cast and crew of ``The Big Kahuna''
filmed a feature in the time some people spend on a beach vacation.
Made in Manhattan in just 16 days and starring Kevin Spacey and
Danny DeVito, ``The Big Kahuna'' may have set a speed record for
high-minded dramas with big-name actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no time for overanalyzing, hand-wringing, ego or
self-interest,'' said the first-time director, John Swanbeck. ``It
was pure instinct for 16 days.''
</P>
<P>
   Adapted by Roger Rueff from his play ``Hospitality Suite,'' the
90-minute film, which opens on Friday, throws three businessmen
into one claustrophobic hotel room and, with a large dose of humor,
forces them to hash out issues of religion, principle and morality.
</P>
<P>
   To milk these grand themes for drama, the filmmakers had to
think small _ they had a budget of $1.8 million and stuck to it.
``When you don't have money to solve problems, it forces everyone
to come up with creative solutions they wouldn't have thought of
otherwise,'' said Spacey, who also produced the film and raised the
money. ``It puts everybody on the ropes. You find out a lot about
yourself, and about others.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing they discovered was that you can't always trust the
conventional wisdom. Originally, the filmmakers had agreed that
``The Big Kahuna,'' like most plays that become movies, would have
to be ``opened up,'' freed from the limitations of its stage
setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we found that the drama went completely flat,'' said
Swanbeck, a Chicago theater director and acting coach who staged
``Hospitality Suite'' in 1993. ``So we thought, `Let's go to the
opposite direction _ deeper into the room, deeper into the
characters.'''
</P>
<P>
   The three colleagues are representing a chemical lubricant firm
at a convention in Wichita, Kan., trying to land an important new
client with a party in their drab hospitality suite. Spacey plays
Larry, a glib, hard-driving cynic trying to give Bob, a devout
young Christian played by Peter Facinelli, the benefit of his
experience. DeVito's older, quieter Phil has to play referee while
struggling with his own despondency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Roger one day that I see this as a story of one man at
three different stages of his life,'' Spacey said on the telephone
from Los Angeles. ``Each has to imagine the others in his shoes,
and they find out how easy it is for someone to cloak his own
prejudices behind a wall of religion or politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Spacey and Swanbeck nurtured their interest in the material for
almost a decade before the cameras rolled. They first met in 1985
in Chicago, when both worked on the original production of David
Rabe's ``Hurlyburly,'' Swanbeck as an assistant to the director and
Spacey as an understudy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sent him the play back in 1991 or so, and he loved it,''
said the affable, intense Swanbeck. When Spacey started Trigger
Street Productions, his filmmaking company, in 1997, he made the
collaboration a priority. Swanbeck knew that when Spacey finally
found a window between projects, there would be little time to
lose. In January 1999, the call came: ``We're shooting in three
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news was that it would be February, a slow time for
films in New York; this allowed Spacey and Swanbeck to hire an
unusually good crew, including the cinematographer Anastas Michos
(``Man on the Moon''). ``He's really the reason we got the movie in
the can in 16 days,'' Swanbeck said. ``He defied the rule that you
can't have cheap, fast and beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Spacey pulled off his own feat: rehearsing the lead role in
``The Iceman Cometh'' on Broadway by day and filming ``The Big
Kahuna'' at night. He had worked out a deal with the director of
``Iceman,'' Howard Davies, allowing the actor to leave in the late
afternoon during the early stages of rehearsal. His having played
the part in London made moonlighting in another very talky work a
bit easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some strange way they sort of complemented one another,
since I was playing salesmen in both,'' Spacey said. He would begin
rehearsing ``Iceman'' at 10 a.m. Around 4 p.m., he would head to
the film's set at Chelsea Piers.
</P>
<P>
   DeVito and Facinelli filmed their scenes in the early
afternoons; when Spacey got there, they would all rehearse briefly
and then shoot until 11:30 p.m. Back in his hotel, Spacey would
often brainstorm with Swanbeck by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   The frenetic pace of ``The Big Kahuna'' might have cowed another
first-time director.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the night before we started shooting,'' said
Swanbeck, who was staying at the New York apartment of a friend.
``I bolted up and thought, `I've forgotten to be terrified.'''
</P>
<P>
   Swanbeck had prepared by producing and editing a short film that
was directed by his wife and longtime collaborator, Nancy Scanlon.
``I thought the best way for me as a director to do a good job for
Kevin Spacey the producer would be to learn his job,'' he said. ``I
could get all the first-timer mistakes out of the way, and then
wouldn't spend the 16 days we had learning who the gaffer is.''
</P>
<P>
   But he still wanted to be candid about his newcomer status. ``On
the first day I said to the crew, `I'll make a deal with you,''' he
recalled. `` `I'll be very clear and decisive about the story we
want to tell. You guys are responsible for catching it on film.'''
</P>
<P>
   It was an apt approach, since Rueff's script deals with the
perils of thinking you have all the answers. A chemical engineer
and playwright who once worked in the lubricants industry himself,
he said the focus of the drama is not religion, though it is a
catalyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about character versus principles,'' Rueff said on the
phone from his home in Naperville, Ill. ``Because I don't think
those are synonymous. In a nutshell, principles are what you have
when you don't have character.''
</P>
<P>
   Though no one abandoned his principles to get the movie made,
shortcuts abounded. They ranged from taking low salaries _
``Originally, we got carfare and a sandwich,'' joked Spacey _ to
using DeVito's own wardrobe when a schedule change caught the
costumer without the shirt needed for a scene.
</P>
<P>
   There were other examples of ``guerrilla filmmaking,'' Swanbeck
said. One night Spacey called him at 2 a.m. with a new idea: to
shoot a scene between two of the characters across a breakfast
cart. But there was no such cart on set.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got there the next day, there's Kevin standing on the
back of the grip truck, dressed in work boots and jeans, unloading
hotel furniture,'' Swanbeck said. ``He had ordered room service
breakfast for two. Then he wheeled the breakfast cart out of the
hotel.'' Swanbeck was careful to add that it was promptly returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``As he was doing that all the other bellboys were pushing their
carts saying, `Doesn't that bellboy look like Kevin Spacey?'''

N.Y. SEWER PLANT REPAIRS LAG IN AREAS NEAR CITY RESERVOIRS
</HEADLINE>
 By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A program to modernize 102 sewage plants discharging
waste water into New York City's reservoirs is drastically behind
schedule, jeopardizing the city's efforts to avoid having to build
a $6 billion water filtration plant, according to federal and state
officials monitoring the city's plan to cut pollution of its water
supply.
</P>
<P>
   The latest criticism of the city's sewage-control program came
on Tuesday in a 40-page report released by James M. Tierney, an
assistant state attorney general who in 1998 was designated by Gov.
George Pataki as the state's ``watershed inspector general'' and
charged with tracking the city's cleanup work.
</P>
<P>
   The report concludes that the sewage-plant modernization program
is ``grossly behind schedule'' and has not progressed beyond
preliminary planning, making it nearly impossible for the city to
fulfill its commitment to complete all of the work by May 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giving them every benefit I could, if this continues at this
pace, this program could be two years late,'' said Tierney, whose
position was created as part of an agreement on a cleanup plan
signed in 1997 by the city, state and several dozen communities
around the city's reservoirs. ``That's two more years that
contaminants are flowing into the drinking water,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The delays mean that three years after the city committed to
spending more than $75 million to fix the plants, no construction
has begun, and more than 10 million gallons a day of inadequately
treated waste water continues to mix with water bound for city
taps, Tierney said.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Mears, a spokeswoman for the federal Environmental
Protection Agency, said on Tuesday that the pace of the sewage
cleanup was ``an important part of our decision as to whether to
allow the city to continue to avoid filtering.''
</P>
<P>
   Over all, water quality remains high. But as development
intensifies in the rural and suburban hills around the city's 19
reservoirs, she and Tierney said, contamination could worsen
without the sewage-plant improvements.
</P>
<P>
   The work on the plants is an important component of a five-year
$600 million city plan to stop pollution from tainting its biggest,
cleanest reservoirs, which are in the Catskills. That plan was
announced with much fanfare by city and state officials in 1997 and
succeeded in averting a federal order for the city to filter its
water.
</P>
<P>
   The sewage plants, dotted around the reservoirs from Westchester
to Delaware County, have long been seen by water experts as a
troublesome source of pollution and parasites like cryptosporidium,
which can cause diarrhea and severe complications in people with
weakened immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   The report from the attorney general's office echoes concerns
raised in a letter sent by the EPA to city water officials last
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very concerned that the city is in jeopardy of missing
most if not all of its deadlines for the sewage plant upgrades,''
Mears said Tuesday. Next month, the agency is scheduled to issue a
detailed interim report on the city's cleanup, and it will focus
significantly on the sewage problem, Mears said. She said that it
was unlikely that continuing sewage problems alone would result in
an eventual filtration order, but added that progress on this work
``is certainly a very key requirement.''
</P>
<P>
   New York City is the only large city in the United States that
has no filters for its water but also has sewage plants releasing
waste water into its reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the enormous volume of the system _ more than a billion
gallons a day _ has minimized the potential harm from the 10
million gallons a day flowing from the waste plants. But the EPA
has tightened rules for drinking water in recent years, leading to
pressure on the city to clean up the plants.
</P>
<P>
   Of particular concern are intestinal parasites like
cryptosporidium, which are difficult to kill with chlorination
alone and which can travel in poorly treated waste water.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the state report on Tuesday, Joel A. Miele, the
city commissioner of environmental protection, acknowledged that
the program was behind schedule, but said that state officials were
not helping matters by focusing on criticizing the city instead of
prodding upstate communities to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   A major roadblock for the project, he said, has been that the
money and technical help is coming from the city, but the work must
be initiated by the dozens of communities that own and use the
plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're effectively dealing with 102 different entities,'' Miele
said, referring to the plants' owners. ``That in itself is
mind-boggling.''
</P>
<P>
   He said some communities with old plants where repairs were
particularly important were continuing to delay work for a variety
of reasons, including trying to get more money from the city and
exploiting the issue in local politics.
</P>
<P>
   Miele declined to name specific towns because negotiations are
still under way. ``Some players are stalling for political reasons
or economic advantage, and there are others who really want to get
together with us and get this done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Eliot L. Spitzer, the attorney general, might have
had more impact if he had directed his office's criticism away from
the city and toward state agencies that could help put pressure on
watershed towns to accelerate the work.
</P>
<P>
   Other city officials went further, implying that Spitzer, who is
a Democrat, and the EPA, operating under a Democratic
administration, were trying to use the issue to hurt Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, a Republican who is running for a U.S. Senate seat
against Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But in defense of his office's report, Spitzer noted that his
subordinate, Tierney, had been appointed by two Republicans, Pataki
and Dennis C. Vacco, a former attorney general.

STREET TALK COMPLETE WITH GLOSSARY  
 FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 23) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATT WOLF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ As is often the case by this point in the Broadway
season, London playwrights are having their say. This year, three
of England's senior dramatists are represented in plays both new
and in revival: Michael Frayn (``Copenhagen''), Peter Shaffer
(``Amadeus'') and Tom Stoppard (``The Real Thing'').
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday they will be joined Off Broadway by one of
Britain's younger generation when Rebecca Prichard, 28, makes her
American theater debut with her play ``Yard Gal.''
</P>
<P>
   In previews at the MCC Theater in Chelsea, ``Yard Gal'' is a
study over time of two feisty, quick-witted girl gang members. As
in London, the cast consists of Amelia Lowdell and Sharon
Duncan-Brewster, two little-known English actresses in their early
20s whose performances have been acclaimed for merging seamlessly
as one. (Think a multicultural, not to mention female, English
variant on Philip Seymour Hoffman and John C. Reilly's brothers in
the current revival of Sam Shepard's ``True West'' and you get the
idea.) Lowdell portrays Marie, who is white, and Duncan-Brewster
plays Boo, who is black.
</P>
<P>
   By the play's end, one teen-ager is behind bars, while the
other, the author suggests, is moving ahead with her life, though
not without memories of some people who ``stay inside you ...
always with me, all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   As they carve a frequently lawless and drug-fueled path through
the multiracial streets of Hackney, East London, the young women
speak a heightened local patois, where, among many other variations
in language, ``isn't it'' becomes ``innit'' and ``thieving''
becomes ``tiefin'.'' (The MCC program will include a glossary for
those uninitiated in East End-speak.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Yard Gal'' was originally presented at the Royal Court Theater
(directed there by Gemma Bodinetz, who is repeating her assignment
in New York) and has followed the path to New York of two other
Royal Court plays: Jez Butterworth's ``Mojo,'' which the Atlantic
Theater Company put on in 1997, and Mark Ravenhill's ``Shopping and
...,'' for which Bodinetz served as co-director when it was at New
York Theater Workshop in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Butterworth and Ravenhill are also members of the younger
generation of English playwrights and all three plays employ
stylized speech that their often lower-class characters seem to
revel in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rich and robust,'' Prichard said of the dialogue in
``Yard Gal.'' ``And it reflects the way the street girls are
survivors. I think it has a natural larger-than-life quality.
Hopefully, it's poetic.''
</P>
<P>
   The play's title refers to a member of a girl gang, with a
``yardie'' originally denoting someone from Jamaica. ``It's a
London term,'' Prichard said, ``that is used ironically in the
play. These aren't all yard gals; they're sort of yard gal
wannabes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bodinetz, the director, said of the play's language: ``It's so
particular that most people in London didn't know the terms that
were being used. But then they all just said, `Go with it; trust
it.' I don't know that it's going to be that much more difficult in
New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps Bodinetz is simply used to such cultural transplants.
In February she directed the world premiere at the Royal Court of
the American playwright Kia Corthron's ``Breath, Boom.'' Its
subject? A murderous girl gang in the Bronx. ``I had to keep
slowing that down through previews,'' the director said. ``English
audiences couldn't quite keep up with the quickfire way the play
was written.''
</P>
<P>
   Prichard has her own theories about the accessibility of her
dialogue in ``Yard Gal.'' ``You can absorb the world of the play
without understanding every sentence,'' she said, arguing that the
story ``goes on enough of an emotional journey that I don't think
the language is ever a barrier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like when you watch plays from a different era, from
another century,'' said Prichard, who studied drama at Exeter
University and worked as a waitress at Pizza Hut before committing
herself full time to writing. ``It's still worth doing, even if you
can't dissect every line.''
</P>
<P>
   Tall, soft-spoken and possessed of a dramatic presence that
suggests she would be equally at home onstage or off, Prichard
could never be mistaken for either of her ``Yard Gal'' heroines.
``I'm as white middle class as you can get,'' she said with a
laugh, having grown up in Essex, east of London. When she was 9,
her parents divorced and her father, an engineer, now lives in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   She spoke of being attracted as a writer to the harsher areas of
existence, which she depicted, she hoped, in a vibrant and
nonpolemical way. ``The alternative,'' she said, ``is a kind of
escapism I don't agree with. It's irresponsible, morally, not to
face up to some of the realities'' of life.
</P>
<P>
   A co-production in London between the Royal Court and the Clean
Break Theater Company, ``Yard Gal'' was commissioned by Clean
Break. The organization was started by two former inmates who
wanted to provide a voice for female ex-offenders and prisoners
past and present.
</P>
<P>
   As is true of all the writers hired by Clean Break since it was
founded in 1979, Prichard grounded her material in issues
surrounding women's experiences in the British criminal justice
system. The bonus was an extensively researched piece of theater _
Clean Break receives money from the government to stage one such
project annually _ possessed not just of a self-evident social
awareness but of writing that was applauded for being buoyantly,
theatrically alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The language is beguilingly rich,'' wrote Charles Spencer in
The Daily Telegraph during the original engagement of ``Yard Gal''
in 1998, which sold out in London and then went on a five-week tour
to prisons, theaters and arts centers around the country.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, Prichard said, her aim was to write a play
rooted in the grim realities of London street life without
wallowing in despair. ``I do tend to write about people who've been
marginalized or cut off,'' she said. Her previous play, ``Fair
Game,'' adapted from the work of an Israeli writer, Edna Mazya,
sparked some controversy in the London press over its depiction of
teen-age rape as re-enacted nightly by teen-age actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``For adults' comfort,'' Prichard said, ``we like to think of
childhood as innocent, when what we're protecting is our own kind
of comfort zone.'' In any case, she added wryly, ``none of the
journalists had read the play.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, if you brutalize an audience,'' Prichard
said, ``then I think you're defeating yourself. There's got to be
enough humanity for people to stay with it so they don't switch
off. If you don't transcend that, what are you writing about?''

PEDIATRICIAN SAYS ELIAN BEING EXPLOITED BY FAMILY 

</HEADLINE>

c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The public relations battle over the fate of Elian
Gonzalez intensified Tuesday after immigration officials released a
letter from a pediatrician who said the young shipwreck survivor
has been ``horrendously exploited'' by his Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The letter drew an immediate response from the relatives'
attorneys who said the boy is afraid to return to his Cuban father,
and from supporters who said the doctor lacked credibility because
he had not examined the boy.
</P>
<P>
   The claims and counterclaims were the latest in the relentless
war of words over the issue of Elian. The 6-year-old has been at
the center of a custody fight between his Cuban father and
Cuban-American relatives since he was rescued from the ocean south
of Florida last November. His mother and 10 others drowned fleeing
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The exchanges also came amid intense anticipation of a federal
appeals court ruling that could decide whether the boy returns to
Cuba with his father or remains in the United States with his
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Irwin Redlener, the pediatrician advising the federal
government, said Elian is being psychologically abused by the
relatives and should be removed from their home immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elian Gonzalez is now in a state of imminent danger to his
physical and emotional well-being in a home that I consider to be
psychologically abusive,'' Redlener wrote to Attorney General Janet
Reno and Doris Meissner, the commissioner of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``In recent days, the crisis has taken a profound turn for the
worse,'' wrote Redlener, president and director of community
pediatrics at the Children's Hospital at Montefiore in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   Redlener referred to allegations that Juan Miguel Gonzalez, the
boy's father, abused his son and mother, and to a videotape
released by Miami relatives showing the boy angrily refusing to
return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Redlener said he was concerned about the boy's well being
because the recent maneuverings have occurred in ``an environment
of radical hysteria, and suggestions of public defiance and
potential violence promulgated by the custodial family and their
supporters in Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   The INS released the letter Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Redlener recommended the government immediately remove Elian
from the custody of his great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   At the government's request, Redlener selected the panel of
three mental health experts who last week interviewed Juan Miguel
Gonzalez and Lazaro Gonzalez, the boy's great uncle. The two were
interviewed for the sole purpose of establishing guidelines for an
orderly transfer of the boy's custody to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the relatives said the government would understand
Elian's fears if it conducted a psychological evaluation of the
boy, which it has refused to do.
</P>
<P>
   An impending ruling from the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
in Atlanta is expected to clarify the legal issue. Attorneys for
the Miami relatives secured a temporary injunction last Thursday
preventing U.S. authorities from returning the boy to Cuba. The
injunction did not prevent the boy from being reunited with his
father, who came to the United States to claim his son.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the Justice Department last week asked the appeals
court to lift its temporary injunction and allow Juan Miguel
Gonzalez to take sole custody of his son. The motion included a
promise from Gonzalez to remain in the United States until the
appeals process has been exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Miami Herald reported Tuesday that the protection
of Elian and related expenses has cost taxpayers $1 million so far.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Samuel Goldberg has 51 skullcaps _ and counting. He
has Knicks, Mets, Bulls, Michigan, Duke and Penn State. But for the
month of March he wore Tar Heels and only Tar Heels, a blue suede
number bearing the logo of his favorite college basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   But that was last month. Now, his most treasured skullcap _ kipa
in Hebrew and yarmulke in Yiddish _ is the Nike one he recently
picked up at a classmate's bar mitzvah, another blue suede one
decorated with the trademark swoosh and an inscription inside,
``Jason Katz Just Did it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have more yarmulkes than socks,'' said Samuel, 13, a seventh
grader at the Ramaz Middle School, a liberal Orthodox yeshiva on
the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Wild and weird skullcaps, adorned with everything from sports
team logos to the Cookie Monster to the phrase ``I drank 12 beers
last night,'' have been popular among modern Orthodox Jewish boys
for about a decade. But what was once a modest trend has become a
full-blown craze inside the liberal yeshivas of New York City,
where skullcap styles go in and out of fashion like hemlines.
</P>
<P>
   With it all have come voices of dissent, the loudest from Jewish
scholars and ultra-Orthodox leaders, including some yeshiva
headmasters who have barred students from wearing anything but the
traditional black velvet or suede kipa. After all, a kipa is worn
by observant Jewish boys and men _ and a growing number of women _
as a sign of humility before God.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really feel the kipa symbolizes something,'' said Rabbi
Yerachmeil Milstein, executive director of the Yeshiva Ketana, on
the Upper West Side, where only traditional skullcaps are
permitted. ``It's a relationship with God, and somehow that message
can get lost with all this brand noise. When it becomes this
commercial, it loses its true symbolism.''
</P>
<P>
   The fad has also created potential legal problems for retailers.
Companies, like Nike, trying to stamp out counterfeit logos have
taken issue with some of the newest skullcaps, whose logos are sewn
on by hand by mothers and grandmothers or produced as unlicensed
products by designers who supply the Judaica shops.
</P>
<P>
   Children's Television Workshop, for example, forced one
Manhattan Judaica shop, the J.Levine Co. in the garment district,
to remove Sesame Street skullcaps from its shelves, said the
store's owner, Daniel Levine.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Nike official said that the company had recently
confiscated a few adorned with swooshes, as part of a routine sweep
in Manhattan of vendors selling unlicensed Nike merchandise. But
the official, Vada O. Manager, director of global issues
management, said Nike had no plans yet to focus on skullcaps
because there are still relatively few available.
</P>
<P>
   ``The yarmulke, as venerable and noble an article of clothing it
is, is not something we sell among our performance athletic line,''
he said. ``But it's not something we plan to specifically enforce.
That would be like trying to prosecute a kid who had a swoosh cut
into his hair at the barber shop.''
</P>
<P>
   To many liberal Orthodox parents and educators, though, the
kipa-collecting frenzy among 11- and 12-year-olds is a great
development. It is not always easy to persuade adolescent city boys
to wear a kipa, especially when their non-Jewish peers are wearing
baseball caps and teasing them about the ``beanies,'' a derogatory
term for skullcaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are quietly encouraging it,'' said Rabbi Eliezer Rubin,
headmaster of the Ramaz Middle School. ``If the kids can find
something positive to attach to ritual Judaism through their own
personal choice, then we're only happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The fad, said Samuel's mother, Dale Goldberg, ``takes something
that has a religious aspect and makes it fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuel's father, Saul Goldberg, who owned four skullcaps growing
up in Brooklyn, marveled at his son's collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably wore the same one every day,'' Goldberg said. ``But
Sam changes every day. A new one comes out, and it's his
favorite.''
</P>
<P>
   Several boys at Ramaz, which is considered one of the most
liberal yeshivas in the city, agreed that the new styles make
wearing a skullcap more fun _ or at least bearable. (A few admitted
to covering them with baseball caps or removing them when they
leave school grounds.)
</P>
<P>
   Going back to the 1950s, when some boys, including Samuel's
father, wore what were known as ``ivy league'' skullcaps, made of
plaid and adorned with a belt buckle, Jewish boys and men have used
their skullcaps to make statements about fashion, their political
views or their own identity. In Israel the size and style of the
kipa identifies its wearer's position on the ideological and
religious spectrum. Some of the kipa decorations now popular in New
York, including Pokemon and the Power Rangers, first appeared in
that country.
</P>
<P>
   But in New York City, the latest styles have come to symbolize
an unprecedented assimilation of Jewish religious practice with
American pop culture, several scholars said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way of demonstrating that you share more than one
culture,'' said Samuel Heilman, the Harold Proshansky professor of
Jewish Studies at the City University of New York. ``It says that I
am _ though I wear a kipa _ very much in the mainstream of
contemporary American culture.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent appearance of company logos on skullcaps has touched
off some hand-wringing among other Jewish scholars, who say the
trend that began with Sesame Street yarmulkes for toddlers has now
gone too far.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Andrew N. Bachman, director of the Edgar M. Bronfman
Center for Jewish Student Life at New York University, said he was
particularly disturbed by the Nike skullcaps because of what he
says are the company's bad labor practices, which many Orthodox
Jewish college students have protested. Nike says it is moving to
improve working conditions at its factories overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many Jewish kids involved in the anti-sweatshop
movement on campus,'' Bachman said. ``There's some kind of
disconnect between a religious symbol and a company emblem which,
to me, symbolizes questionable ethical and labor practices.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Orthodox boys reach high school, they tend to wear
plainer styles, several parents and teen-agers said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bachman said he had recently observed a few notable new
kipa styles on campus, including what he described as rasta,
hip-hop and ``neo-Hasidic hippie'' looks.

SCHOOL DISTRICT RETHINKS A SODA-POP STRATEGY
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Wis., Colo., N.Y.) By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The school district of Madison, Wis., thought it could have its
Coke and drink it, too.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Madison became a pioneer of sorts, signing a contract
that gave Coca-Cola exclusive rights to supply all the district's
soda vending machines. The idea was to collect the cash that
Coca-Cola was dangling _ a $100,000 signing bonus, plus about
$500,000 over the life of the three-year contract _ without
yielding to crass commercialism. Madison, the first large school
district to sign an exclusive vending contract, thought it could do
so without compromising its educational mission.
</P>
<P>
   Coke, of course, wanted to showcase its products and imprint a
brand preference on young minds, with educators' implicit approval.
The school board was wary, and sought to keep its educational honor
intact by accepting far less than the $1.5 million that Coke had
initially offered. Among promotions that the board rejected were
Coke T-shirts and Instant Coke awards, software that informed
students about college scholarships and displayed a Coke logo, and
a ``nutrition curriculum'' that featured Fruitopia, a Coke product.
</P>
<P>
   Coke's money has since financed new band uniforms, school trips,
violin rentals and other extracurricular needs of the district. But
despite the contract's limitations, unease has grown within the
school board and among the public. Renewal of the contract is now
in question.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Robarts, a board member who at first favored the deal, said
teachers and students were upset that in the absence of
competition, the price of a Coke from a school vending machine had
risen to $1 from 40 cents.
</P>
<P>
   There are also objections that schools now seem to be partners
in peddling junk food to the young. Robarts said she had been
peppered with angry letters from parents and others around Madison
(which lies in the dairy state, after all) suggesting that the
board had sacrificed an important ideal _ schools should not be
bombarding children with advertising _ to get its mitts on easy
cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all said, `This is outrageous,' '' Robarts recalled.
``They would say, `We understand you're not directly providing
these products to young children, but you're still advertising
them.'''
</P>
<P>
   In one school where administrators decided that Coke machines
would be off limits to the children, a giant new machine that the
company brought in was too large to fit through the door of the
teachers' lounge, where it was supposed to be placed so that
students would not see it. So it glows and hums out in the hall.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with the approach of the contract's expiration in August,
other board members say the schools are now dependent on Coke and
the extras that the revenue buys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to challenge my school board colleagues that if we
don't extend this contract, let's open up our personal checkbooks
and cover the amount we are losing for extracurricular
activities,'' said one member, Juan Jose Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   Madison illustrates the tangled allegiances confronting school
boards that elect to dance with corporate sponsors. The problem is
that schools never really know until the music begins who is going
to lead, they or the sponsor. For many boards, what begins as an
innocuous arrangement can become a troubling one.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Commercial Free Public Education, which battles
many proposals for exclusive school contracts, estimates that about
175 districts around the nation have arrangements with Coke or
Pepsi, the biggest payout being the $8.1 million from a Coke
bottler to a Colorado Springs district in a 10-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just soda. New York City this month began
discussing a plan to finance laptop computers for its
schoolchildren by using income from companies linked to a
school-system Web site. The plan has already come under fire: some
worry that schools are sending a message that everything is for
sale.
</P>
<P>
   In Madison, the debate is expected to begin later this spring,
and arguments are already building as to how to make ends meet if
the Coke contract is not extended for two years. Coke is dangling
another carrot: a new $100,000 signing bonus, in addition to
further revenue over the contract's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we have developed a value-added partnership with the
Madison Metropolitan School District,'' said Kevin Morris, a
spokesman for Coca-Cola Enterprises, which services Madison's
school vending machines.
</P>
<P>
   Madison's dilemma is likely to plague other school systems.
``The underlying problem,'' Robarts said, ``is principals and
others do need more money on a regular basis to provide a number of
things that come up.''

 &HT;    Hurrah! Rocker shuts his mouth
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The flower of American sportswriting bordered one
entire facet of the Turner Field diamond. Newspapers from New York,
Chicago, Washington and one claiming to represent the whole USA had
urgently dispatched correspondents, as did all your major cable
news networks.
</P>
<P>
   A postseason-type gathering in April. All here Tuesday for John
Rocker Appreciation Night. What a festive occasion.
</P>
<P>
   You may have heard something about the Braves closer being out
the first two weeks of the season with severe spasms of the voice
box. Rocker himself made it known he would have nothing else to say
on the evening of his reinstatement, other than a quick take with
the Braves' flagship radio station.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, I'd rail against the silent treatment. It's real bad
for the journalism business. With his stance, Rocker leaves it to
his more stand-up (read that ``smarter'') teammates to speak to his
situation. But, considering that any time he opens his mouth there
is the high likelihood of something primordial oozing out, he's
better off keeping the door to his soul closed. Should he evolve
into a Steve Carlton or Eddie Murray, then at least something good
will have come of this experience. Any moment not talking to John
Rocker is another that could be spent in conversation with someone
interesting. There are plenty of those in the home clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   So, there we all were Tuesday chasing a story that, frankly,
began running out of legs months ago. The fact that Rocker had
returned and was ready to _ irony alert _ lend some stability to
the Braves' bullpen was a form of news. Other than that, there
really is little new ground to break. All opinions on the subject
have set as hard as a pool deck.
</P>
<P>
   This is what it has come to: A fellow writer wandered the outer
perimeter of the stadium, looking for fan reaction. In the
distance, he spotted two figures who looked to be dressed in white
robes. Now, there's a story, he's thinking. But the two take a step
closer and reveal themselves to be nuns, not Klansmen. What a
comedown.
</P>
<P>
   We try to ferret out such important information as just what
music will accompany Rocker as he runs to the rescue in the ninth
inning. It used to be Twisted Sister's ``I Wanna Rock,'' until the
heavy metal group announced it wanted no connection to an accused
xenophobe. Managing to disgust Twisted Sister should be a
life-changing experience. By the way, no new anthem has been
selected.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Glavine spoke for the team, John Schuerholz lectured on the
media's part in this mess and the world was largely unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   And while all of us tripped over the usual nonsense, there was
this wonderful, poignant moment playing itself out practically
unnoticed during pregame batting practice. A family of four from
Columbia, S.C., was lost amid the mob on the field. The youngest,
6-year-old Brett Ballentine, was there as a survivor, a child who
for more than half his life had fought leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   Over to the Ballentines came Andres Galarraga, author of the one
Braves story that actually deserves constant retelling. His own
comeback from cancer galloping along so well, Galarraga got close
to the child and told him to keep taking his medicine, to keep a
smile on his face. He held out the very real hope of recovery. Then
the huge man enveloped the little boy in a hug.
</P>
<P>
   And Tuesday took on real meaning.

costing 45,000 employees and retirees $1.1 billion by selling

EDITORIAL: A CLEAR CHOICE ON CHINA TRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, April 19:
</P>
<P>
   By permanently awarding China the normal trading status it has
enjoyed for two decades, Congress can advance American economic
interests without diluting its support for human rights on the
mainland or the defense of democracy on Taiwan. Yet while Senate
passage seems assured, the House is wavering as both liberal
Democrats and conservative Republicans withhold support. Both
groups should reconsider their opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Passing the trade bill, which is scheduled for a vote in May,
would lock in the market-opening concessions by China. These
include easier access for foreign telecommunications companies and
a reduction of state controls over the economy, steps that would
expand the sale of American goods in China. Over time, lower trade
barriers could loosen constraints on information and political
debate. Without the trade deal, American businesses would be at a
disadvantage in the China market.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats, including the House minority leader, Dick
Gephardt, argue that granting permanent trade rights to China would
sacrifice the leverage now available to Congress through its annual
votes on China's trade status. But those votes have become empty
rituals, with China's trading rights invariably renewed. Pressure
on trade is an inappropriate way to seek human rights reforms in
China, since trade restrictions insulate China from progressive
outside influences.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich, has proposed steps that would couple
permanent trade status with new tools for monitoring and pressing
China on human rights and fulfillment of its trade commitments. If
warranted, Congress could also consider applying penalties allowed
by World Trade Organization rules. This approach would create more
effective American pressure on these issues than the annual trade
status reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Most House Republicans support the trade bill. But some have
held back to protest Chinese belligerence toward Taiwan. China's
threatening tone before last month's Taiwanese presidential
election was troubling, but Beijing's rhetoric has lately been more
restrained. Washington should continue trying to calm the tensions,
not inflame them with the sale of sophisticated weapons to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration struck the right balance in its newly
announced package of arms sales to Taiwan. This includes a variety
of upgraded missiles and radars but rightly omits the four
destroyers with advanced Aegis antimissile technology that had been
requested by Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Opening China's markets advances American, Chinese and Taiwanese
interests. Other matters like the preservation of democracy in
Taiwan and the expansion of liberty in China are equally important
American objectives. They are best pursued by disentangling them
from trade issues.

<P>
   Cisco Systems, the data networking company based in San Jose,
Calif., is expected to announce on Wednesday that it has entered
into a multibillion-dollar alliance with SBC Communications, which
is based in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at the two companies said that SBC, the nation's
biggest local phone company, would be among the largest buyers of
Cisco's routers and switches that are used to build the Internet's
infrastructure. Tom McGrath, president of SBC DataComm, would not
disclose the value of the equipment SBC planned to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco and SBC will co-market and co-sell their products and
services _ with SBC selling Cisco equipment to its customers and
Cisco referring customers to SBC. It is one of the first times
Cisco has closely aligned itself with a traditional telephone
company, executives said. It will provide equipment to send
information over five distinct networking platforms, including
digital subscriber lines, which are faster than dial-up modems, and
other services that can transmit data, voice and video.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies will also collaborate on joint research and
product development. The two companies hope to develop products to
make it easier for Internet users to switch between different
Internet service providers, as well as a local area network.

<HEADLINE>
EDITORIAL: SAVING THE MIRANDA RULE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, April 19:
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court will hear a challenge today to its pivotal
Miranda ruling of 1966, which requires police to advise suspects of
their rights before beginning an interrogation. As most viewers of
television crime shows can recite, the Miranda rule requires that
criminal suspects be told of their right to remain silent and have
a lawyer present, and that any statement they make can be used
against them. For the court to overturn Miranda would be an
unwarranted rollback of safeguards against coercion in the criminal
justice system.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a mischievous ruling last year by an appellate court
in Virginia, which held that a failure to issue Miranda warnings no
longer required automatic exclusion in federal prosecutions of the
evidence obtained. Congress, the court reasoned, had effectively
overruled the Miranda decision when it enacted a 1968 law for that
purpose. The 1968 statute provides that a confession is admissible
as long as it is ``voluntarily given'' in light of ``all the
circumstances,'' whether or not the suspect was read his rights.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that the court's Miranda decision was a
constitutional ruling, which Congress cannot overturn merely by
passing a law. That requires a constitutional amendment, which is
why no attorney general of either party has tried to enforce the
1968 law in the intervening decades. True, Chief Justice Earl
Warren's majority opinion in Miranda invited Congress and the
states to develop ``fully effective'' alternative safeguards that
could replace the Miranda warning. But Congress was not trying to
develop better safeguards with the 1968 law. It sought to reinstate
the same case-by-case test for assessing the voluntariness of
confessions that the Supreme Court, quite correctly, found
unworkable two years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The case has stirred old passions and prompted the filing of a
foot-high stack of briefs by ``friends of the court'' on both sides
of the issue. But as a constitutional and law enforcement matter,
this should be an easy call. Much as the court wisely concluded 34
years ago, the Miranda warnings are an important safeguard for
protecting the Fifth Amendment's privilege against
self-incrimination in the coercive atmosphere of police
questioning. An astonishingly high percentage of suspects _ some 80
to 90 percent _ waive their rights and talk to the police anyway,
belying claims that the Miranda rule badly hampers police work.

ZIMBABWE'S OPPOSITION LEADER WARNS AGAINST PUSHING MUGABE TOWARD
MARTRYDOM 
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Zimbabwe rolls toward more violence, the worst
thing that could happen, in the estimation of its main opposition
leader, is to create a martyr out of its founder and once popular
hero, President Robert Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, conciliation is the way to undercut Mugabe's push for
confrontation, says the opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, a
magnetic trade union leader who has transformed himself into the
chairman of the six-month-old Movement for Democratic Change.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as I would like to take an aggressive stand, that's
what he's looking for,'' said Tsvangirai, who is visiting here to
dramatize the predicament of what was once southern Africa's best
example of economic and social cohesion. ``He's looking to be made
a martyr. We don't need that.''
</P>
<P>
   With more sorrow than anger evident, Tsvangirai described Mugabe
as a ``man I was prepared to die for 20 years ago,'' but who now,
at age 76, is obsessed by money, power and the nation's former
colonial master, Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Tsvangirai, 48, fresh from a visit to London, is making the
rounds of official Washington, seeking support for free and fair
national elections next month. He appeared to be pushing on an open
door. President Clinton's deputy national security adviser, James
Steinberg, sat next to him at a Georgetown dinner on Monday night
and Tsvangirai met with the assistant secretary of state for
African Affairs, Susan Rice.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the Clinton administration has supported Mugabe,
seeking to use his position to bring a settlement to the war in
Congo, where Mugabe has sent about 10,000 of his top troops. It has
shown scant interest in the showdown he was building between
Zimbabwe's white farmers and state-sponsored black squatters.
</P>
<P>
   But patience with Mugabe has worn out.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is trying to encourage what one official
called a ``peaceful de-escalation'' of the crisis so that yet
another African country does not spin out of control. For
neighboring South Africa, Zimbabwe's economic collapse would have
serious consequences: Zimbabwe is South Africa's biggest buyer of
manufactured goods.
</P>
<P>
   Tsvangirai's visit was sponsored by the National Democratic
Institute for International Affairs here. He impressed those who
met him here, the official said, as someone ``who did not focus on
power but on unity and finding a collective way forward.'' It is
vital that the coming elections include international observers,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
   But Tsvangirai said Mugabe appeared intent on fomenting chaos so
that the country appeared to be ungovernable and he could declare a
state of emergency and rule by decree. The Parliament was dissolved
on April 12 in preparation for elections, but the absence of a
sitting legislature could also be used by Mugabe as a step toward
one-man rule, he said.
</P>
<P>
   By dwelling on the question of race _ and specifically, the
domination of the most arable land by 4,500 white farmers _
Tsvangirai said he believes that Mugabe has chosen a rallying cry,
but a hollow one.
</P>
<P>
   Most Zimbabweans were so mired in despair _ more than 50 percent
of the population is unemployed and 2,000 people die of AIDS every
week _ that offering a piece of land did not mean very much, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poverty, unemployment, debt problems, corruption have a
terrible effect on the standard of living of 75 percent of the
people,'' Tsvangirai said. ``When you talk of land in that sea of
poverty it's meaningless. What does land do if you haven't got a
meal?''
</P>
<P>
   He said that land redistribution needed to proceed, but in a way
that would not destabilize the agricultural industry, the backbone
of the economy. Land reform, he said, ``must be done with equity,
empowerment and economic viability.''
</P>
<P>
   Tsvangirai said he is confident that in a free election, his
Movement for Democratic Change will overwhelm Mugabe's Zimbabwe
African National Union-Patriotic Front, which has dominated
politics since it took power in 1980. A recent opinion poll showed
that 65 percent of voters wanted a new government.

BRAZIL IS ALLOWING U.S. COMPANIES TO USE SATELLITE LAUNCHING SITE
</HEADLINE>
 By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Brazil reached an agreement with the United
States on Tuesday to allow American companies to use an equatorial
launching site, advancing the ambitions of Latin America's largest
country to tap the lucrative satellite launching industry.
</P>
<P>
   Under the accord, Brazil would not be permitted to gain access
to the technology of American companies and their clients that
launch satellites from Alcantara, a base in northeastern Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The country has invested more than $200 million in Alcantara,
which is just south of the equator. Satellite launches from the
equator are less expensive because the satellites reach orbit more
quickly and require less rocket fuel.
</P>
<P>
   With the capacity for 14 launches a year, the Alcantara base
could bring Brazil an estimated $30 million each year, joining
other nations that already are profiting from the $2.4 billion
satellite launching market.
</P>
<P>
   ``By entering the space market we're showing the world our
capacity to compete with countries like Kazakhstan, China or French
Guiana,'' Ronaldo Sardenberg, minister of science and technology,
said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   American companies are expected to consider the Alcantara base
an alternative to other equatorial satellite launching sites, such
as the nearby Kourou base in French Guiana, because of the
potential savings in fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``From an operational aspect Alcantara is extremely
attractive,'' said Ronald Covais, the regional president for the
Americas at the Lockheed Martin Corp. ``Our aim now is to become
Brazil's partner of choice in utilizing the site.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies from the United States and other countries currently
use commercial satellite launching facilities in the United States,
China, Russia, French Guiana and Kazakhstan. According to analysts,
the industry is growing nearly 20 percent a year, driven by plans
to create satellite-based global Internet and telecommunications
services.
</P>
<P>
   In South America, the satellite-launching business is heating
up. In addition to Alcantara in Brazil, neighboring Guyana is
weighing a proposal by Beal Aerospace Technologies Inc., a Frisco,
Texas-based company, to use its territory on the equator for the
construction of an advanced launching facility.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil is seeking technological safeguard agreements with
countries besides the United States for the corporate launch of
satellites. And the Brazilian government, acting on behalf of the
country's own satellite-launching program, recently reached an
agreement with the Ukraine for the supply of rocket technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Symbolically it's quite important for Brazil to evolve its
space program,'' said David Fleischer, a professor at the
University of Brasilia.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement reached on Tuesday also holds symbolic importance
for the relations between the United States and Brazil. Differences
over issues such as child labor or American tariffs on Brazil's
exports of orange juice and steel have created tension between the
two countries in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have this type of agreement without a high level of
trust between both parties,'' said Anthony Harrington, the American
ambassador to Brazil. ``It underlines the interest we have in
promoting Brazil's objective of taking advantage of Alcantara.''

CHINESE PRESIDENT ARRIVES IN TURKEY AMID DISPUTE OVER ETHNIC TURKS
IN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: SUBS lede to change `alliance' to `partnership'.) 
By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ President Jiang Zemin of China arrived in
Turkey Tuesday for a long-awaited state visit, but hopes that the
two countries can build a new partnership were overshadowed by a
dispute over ethnic Turks who live in China.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey considers itself the guardian of ethnic Turks around the
world, including the 7.2 million Uighurs who live in western China.
Separatist Uighurs have begun a violent campaign against Chinese
rule, and scores have been jailed or executed, prompting protests
from Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The Uighurs, who are Muslim and speak a Turkic language, have
broad support here. Uighur nationalists maintain an office in
Istanbul, but the Turkish government, wary of provoking China,
watches them closely and does not allow Uighurs here to openly
protest Chinese rule.
</P>
<P>
   China calls the area where Uighurs live the Xinjiang Autonomous
Region, but Turkish politicians and news commentators usually call
it Eastern Turkistan. That phrase suggests that Uighurs belong not
to China but to a broad Turkic region whose inhabitants share a
culture and a language that has nothing in common with the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese authorities are determined not to give further
autonomy to the Uighur region, which is believed to have vast oil
and mineral reserves. They have closed mosques, broken up protests,
moved several million Han Chinese into the region and taken other
steps that Uighur exiles say are intended to weaken or destroy
Uighur identity.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish and Chinese leaders view their countries as natural
allies. Both are rapidly developing nations that hope to play
increasingly important roles in world politics over the coming
decades. Both resent foreign criticism of their human rights
records, and both have strong military establishments with
significant political influence.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang arrived here after a visit to Israel. China is seeking to
buy sophisticated spy planes from Israel, and Israeli leaders have
suggested that they will agree to sell them despite objections from
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey has already begun military cooperation with China. Senior
generals visit each other's headquarters regularly, and cadets
train at each other's military academies. More military accords may
be signed during Jiang's visit this week.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of closer military ties and greatly increased trade
finally convinced nationalists in the Turkish government to endorse
the visit, but they did so grudgingly.
</P>
<P>
   At a state dinner Wednesday, Jiang is to receive a medal that
can be awarded only after a unanimous vote of the Cabinet.
Ministers from the far-right Nationalist Action Party, which has
strongly endorsed the Uighur cause and condemned Chinese actions in
the Uighur region, at first resisted giving their approval but did
so at the last minute.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We have to pursue realistic policies,'' said Abdulhaluk Cay,
the minister in charge of relations with Turkic communities abroad.
``If giving the medal to the Chinese president is in the interest
of Turkey, then we will accept that. We have accepted it. But that
does not mean that we have changed our mind about Eastern
Turkistan. We will convey our message in a friendly atmosphere
during our bilateral meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to a group of writers and performers from eight
Turkic nations on Monday, President Suleyman Demirel did not
mention the Uighurs directly, but he reiterated Turkey's support
for Turkic peoples.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is important is the sense of being Turkic,'' Demirel
said. ``If there are those who cannot say `We are Turks' despite
being Turkic, this is nothing less than a denial of their roots.
After all, what is called the `Turkic world' stretches from the
Adriatic to the Great Wall of China. Both geography and history
show this to be true.''
</P>
<P>
   The Uighur region lies outside the Great Wall.

HAGGLING STIFLES ANY HOPE FOR N.Y. STATE BUDGET DEAL THIS WEEK
</HEADLINE>
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Negotiations over a new state budget came to a
sudden halt on Tuesay after a series of minor squabbles erupted
between Gov. George E. Pataki and leaders of the legislature,
dashing any hopes that the budget would be completed this week, as
lawmakers went home for a nearly two-week break.
</P>
<P>
   The disputes came as Pataki and the leaders were reportedly near
agreement on a major area of spending that had been holding up a
final budget deal: education. The plan being considered calls for
increasing overall state spending for education by a record $1.2
billion, or 8.7 percent, for the coming school year, lawmakers and
their aides said.
</P>
<P>
   The education package has already been approved by legislative
leaders from both parties. It includes $200 million to continue a
program to provide prekindergarten classes to all 4-year-olds and
to reduce class sizes in the early grades. The package also covers
$67.5 million to raise the salaries of teachers in urban districts
like New York City's and $228 million to pay for maintenance
projects in aging school buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The budget is now 18 days late, and legislative leaders had
hoped to have the budget completed before members of the
legislature went home for the Passover and Easter holidays. But
those hopes faded on Tuesday as Pataki and his Democratic rivals in
the legislature clashed on several issues largely unrelated to the
budget.
</P>
<P>
   One dispute centered on a state program that provides school tax
rebates to homeowners statewide. The Democrats accused Pataki, a
Republican, of derailing the talks by resurrecting a proposal he
made earlier this year to have homeowners receive rebate checks
directly from the state instead of the way they do now, through
school districts.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats have resisted the governor's proposal, calling it
a political ploy meant to give Pataki sole credit for providing the
rebate. But Pataki's allies in the legislature denied that there
was anything political about his proposal, saying that he merely
wanted to give the rebate directly to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   The other squabble had to do with the governor's demand that the
legislature adopt his plan for reining in the state's huge debt.
Pataki is apparently withholding his support for a final budget
deal until the Democratic speaker of the state Assembly, Sheldon
Silver, agrees to back a plan that would strictly limit the state's
ability to borrow without voter approval.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's demand comes as he faces mounting criticism from
conservative groups, once his staunchest allies, for expanding the
state's overall debt while the state has been enjoying
multibillion-dollar budget surpluses. Democrats say they are open
to proposals that would restrict the state's borrowing practices,
but add that the issue should not be tied into the budget
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   The squabbling comes nearly two weeks after Pataki and
legislative leaders from both parties announced that they had
agreed to the parameters of a nearly $78 billion budget. That
agreement helped move the budget discussions further along than
they have been at this date in most years. As part of the deal,
Pataki agreed to refrain from making wholesale vetoes, provided the
legislature remained within that figure.
</P>
<P>
   The deal calls for allowing the legislature to add $1.4 billion
to the $76.8 billion budget the governor proposed in January. But
that increase will be partly offset, because the legislature
intends to reduce the governor's estimates of what some programs
will cost. In all, aides to the governor and the legislature
estimate that the final budget will be $77 billion to $78 billion,
an increase of 5 to 6 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
   The spending agreement that legislative leaders reached on
education represents the largest year-to-year increase ever,
providing a total of $13.8 billion to school districts across the
state. New York City is expected to receive more than $400 million
of the $1.2 billion increase that lawmakers are seeking for
education. That is significantly more than the $102 million
increase the city schools would have received under the governor's
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The education package also calls for spending $30 million to
help schools devise programs to reduce violence among students. It
also provides $46 million for a handful of other programs, like
expanding summer school offerings and bilingual education. The
package sets aside an additional $50 million to help poor urban
districts undertake minor repairs in older school buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The one part of the education budget whose fate is unclear is a
project favored by Democrats in the Assembly: repairing seriously
deteriorating school buildings. The Democrats insist that some
money for the program be included in the final budget, but the
amount has not been decided.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki is said to be withholding his support for the plan until
Silver agrees to some of the governor's demands, like his plan to
restrict the state's ability to borrow.
</P>
<P>
   The budget was due on April 1, but for the 16th straight year,
the governor and the legislature missed that deadline. The delay
caused by Tuesday's disagreements means that the earliest that
lawmakers can begin passing the budget is May 1, when they are
scheduled to return.

EDITORIAL: FAMILY PLANNING POLITICS  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, April 19:
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton recently called on Congress to raise aid for
international family planning by $169 million next year, bringing
the total to $541 million in the 2001 budget. That substantial
increase, coming after years of cuts, would merely restore funding
to 1995 levels. Far more is needed. Nearly 600,000 women die
annually from complications of pregnancy and childbirth. Many of
them could be saved by services that help women avoid unintended
pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is also calling on Congress to abolish the pernicious
restriction on advocacy activities that was imposed on foreign
family planning organizations as part of a deal last year to get
Congress to pay back dues owed to the United Nations. Under
longstanding law, no U.S. government funds may be used by foreign
agencies for either abortion services or for lobbying on abortion
policy.
</P>
<P>
   But the restriction, imposed last year, goes further by barring
foreign organizations from receiving American assistance if they
use their own money to provide abortions or to engage in abortion
policy debates in their own countries. A compromise has allowed
Clinton to waive the advocacy restriction, but the waiver
automatically resulted in a $12.5 million cut to family planning
aid. The gag rule is anti-democratic and a prohibition that would
be illegal in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Carolyn Maloney and Nita Lowey, Democrats of New York, are
both sponsoring legislation to end the gag rule. Broad access to
family planning is the best way to reduce the need for abortions.
Congress should finance it without attempting to silence
organizations abroad.

   THE REPUBLICANS:
</P>
<P>
   VICE PRESIDENT McCAIN?: Despite their often bitter feud during
the Republican primaries and the seemingly unfinished work of their
rapprochement, Gov. George W. Bush said Tuesday that Sen. John
McCain was among the many people he would consider as a possible
running mate. ``I know he said he's not interested, but until I
talk to him, and find out how interested or not interested he is,
I'll give him consideration,'' Bush said during a news conference
here. ``A lot of people will be given consideration.'' Bush's
unprompted remark about McCain, during an answer to a question
about potential vice presidents, seemed less a signal of intent
than a gesture of reconciliation. Bush and McCain are scheduled to
talk face to face in Pittsburgh on May 9. McCain has repeatedly
expressed an utter lack of interest in the job. Todd Harris, a
spokesman for McCain, said Tuesday night that the senator's
sentiments were still the same.

   BUCHANAN IN TEXAS: Pat Buchanan's presidential campaign opened a
three-week effort Tuesday to collect the 56,000 petition signatures
necessary for Buchanan to appear on Texas ballots as an independent
candidate. Meanwhile, the Reform Party, whose presidential
nomination Buchanan is seeking, is conducting a separate petition
drive to ensure that their candidate, if not Buchanan, is also
listed. Buchanan told The Dallas Morning News that while he would
prefer to gain ballot access on behalf of the Reform Party, ``we
don't know who's going to claim that the franchise belongs to
them.'' ``He's probably just trying to play it safe,'' said
Elizabeth Hanshaw, director of the Texas secretary of state's legal
division. ``You can't appear twice on the ballot, so if he gets the
Reform Party nomination he would probably just withdraw as an
independent.''

   THE SENATE
</P>
<P>
   MONEY GAP WIDE IN PENNSYLVANIA: For months, Democrats have
believed that Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., was one of the more
vulnerable targets in their bid to recapture control of the Senate.
But the Democratic nominee, Rep. Ron Klink, a 48-year-old moderate
from the Pittsburgh area, won a very costly victory. His campaign
treasury is saddled with more than $446,000 in debts and he has
only $119,000 in the bank, according to the latest Federal Election
Commission records. Because he faced no opposition in the
Republican primary, Santorum enjoys an enormous financial edge. He
has raised $6 million and has more than $3.7 million in the bank,
according to the records.

   FEINSTEIN HAS $2 MILLION: For months, Sen. Dianne Feinstein of
California has held an overwhelming lead in the polls over her
Republican challenger, Rep. Tom Campbell, and in the latest
fund-raising period, she collected nearly twice as much cash. In
the period from Feb. 17 to the end of March, Feinstein took in
$988,000 and spent about $360,000. All told, she had about $2.2
million in cash on hand. By contrast, Campbell reported raising
$565,000 in the latest period, and spent almost $700,000, leaving
him with $615,000. In Feinstein's last race, in 1994, her opponent,
Michael Huffington, spent $26 million, much of it his own money,
and she spent almost $14 million.

CUBANS LOOK FOR THEIR CHANCE TO VISIT, LIVE IN U.S. 

</HEADLINE>

c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA _ Daisy Camejo has been lining up outside the U.S.
diplomatic offices in Cuba's seaside capital for more than a month
now, wearily waiting as her name works its way ever closer to the
eyes of the officials who will decide whether she can travel north
to visit her son in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge left the island several years back to make a better life
in the United States, she said. He was educated in the former
Soviet Union and now works as a computer technician in a city
several hours' drive northwest of Detroit. He sends letters and
photographs home of his new life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very beautiful there,'' Camejo said, leaning against a
tree in a small park where scores of people sat and stood waiting
for word of their visa applications. ``He tells me he is doing very
well. But I need to see him.''
</P>
<P>
   The ordeal of Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old shipwreck survivor
whose Miami relatives are fighting to keep in the United States,
has highlighted the visceral feud between revolutionary leader
Fidel Castro and those who despise him. But it has also drawn
attention to the strong human bonds that tie this communist-ruled
island to the United States and to the gnawing desire of many
Cubans to cross the sea _ either for a while or for a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Now, even as Havana and Washington maneuver to return Elian
home, thousands of Cubans struggle to find a means to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people who want to go,'' Camejo said.
``It's very difficult. There is such strict control.''
</P>
<P>
   A hardy _ many would say foolhardy _ few set out in small boats
across squall-whipped seas to Florida, betting on a longtime and
controversial policy that guarantees residency to any Cuban who is
able to set foot on U.S. soil without being apprehended during the
100-mile voyage. Many, including Elian's mother and 10 other people
who were in his boat, died in the attempt.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps nowhere is the wish to leave more apparent than in
the sun-scorched lots and tree-shaded small parks near the U.S.
Interest Section, a modern, seven-story structure on Havana's
seafront that is an embassy in all but name.
</P>
<P>
   Since mid-February, several thousand Cubans have flocked to the
building each weekday to start the lengthy process that could
eventually win them the legal right to move to the United States,
or at least to visit there for a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Others line up to learn about the progress of their petitions. A
more fortunate few come to collect the permanent visas awarded in a
U.S. government lottery.
</P>
<P>
   And still others, no one really knows for sure how many, try
their luck at sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people wait here for two months. You think they don't
want to get out?'' asked Wilbur, a 64-year-old retired construction
worker who hopes to visit a son in Miami. Like many here critical
of the government, he spoke on the condition that his full name not
be used.
</P>
<P>
   ``A human being wants to be free,'' he said. ``We all have our
aspirations.''
</P>
<P>
   The current visa system, which includes the lines and the days
of waiting in the tropical sun, replaced a process that relied on
the mail. It was perhaps more comfortable but far slower. U.S.
officials say the new system has resulted in far more temporary
visas being given out. Some 10,000 visitor permits already have
been issued here this year, compared with 8,500 granted in all of
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Another 20,000 permanent visas will be assigned by the lottery.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; About 800 Cubans who set foot in southern Florida have been
processed by the Border Patrol since last October. Nobody knows how
many were lost at sea.
</P>
<P>
   The permanent visas are being drawn randomly from a pool of
545,000 Cubans, or about 5 percent of the island's population, who
threw their names in the hopper in the summer of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials say they have no way of knowing how many people
who arrive on visitors permits try to stay in the country
illegally.
</P>
<P>
   Most everyone in Cuba has someone _ a brother, sister, cousin or
uncle _ who has moved to the United States since Castro took power
in the 1959 revolution. Many Cubans survive on the money sent home
by their U.S. relations. Others have heard tales of Miami and other
U.S. cities from visiting relatives and friends.
</P>
<P>
   While some undoubtedly want out simply to put some distance
between themselves and Castro, many others yearn for a chance to
make a better living and to see something beyond the island.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not really politics,'' said Tomas, a 35-year-old nurse
from the beach resort of Varadero, east of Havana, whose name is in
the visa lottery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just that you work hard all the time here and you never
get anywhere,'' he said. ``You see people you know who have left
and have plenty of jobs, plenty of money. It all starts to feel so
frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, Cubans are no different than migrants from
Mexico, Indonesia or anywhere else in the developing world.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by the International Labor Organization, a U.N.
agency, estimates that more than 120 million people are now
migrants worldwide. The study predicts that migration will rise
dramatically in the coming decades when the globalized market
economy widens the disparity between rich and poor nations.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is the main attraction for Cubans. But
thousands more have left for Mexico, Venezuela and other countries.
In many instances, only an invitation from those countries'
citizens to a Cuban is enough for a visa. So, some Cubans work
desperately to get married or for other personal relationships that
could lead to such an invitation.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. tourist permits are more likely to be given to people who
are reasonably certain to return home, officials say. Often, the
successful applicants worldwide are those who can prove they own
property, have substantial bank accounts or hold good jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, where wages average $10 a month and private property is
at a minimum, the best guarantee that someone will return is
family. Tourist permits, therefore, tend to go to older applicants
who have spouses, children and grandchildren remaining on the
island.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter and granddaughter are here. I have no reason to
leave forever,'' said Mercedes Barcelo, 47, who found out Tuesday
that her visa request had been rejected. ``I just wanted to go for
a visit.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro's supporters used to call everyone who left ``worms.''
That view has softened over the past decade because dollars from
tourism and Cubans abroad have helped Castro's government survive
the collapse of Communism most everywhere else. Still, those
seeking visas this week said they feel stigmatized in a nation that
harshly distinguishes between its friends and enemies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never committed a crime in my life,'' said Wilbur, the
construction worker hoping to travel to Miami. ``But now if I want
to leave I am a counter-revolutionary, a criminal, a thief.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as it prepares for Elian's return, the Cuban
government appears to be shifting its public focus to other issues
that can fortify the island's revolutionary zeal. About 100,000
Cubans marched past the embassy of the Czech Republic Tuesday in
protest of that country's call for a U.N. censure of Cuba's human
rights record. ``Traitors, lackeys and puppets,'' the crowd
chanted.
</P>
<P>
   Some working to change Cuban politics and society argue that the
widespread fixation with leaving the island hampers efforts to
transform it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is it that the people who have the most, instead of
staying to resolve the problems in Cuba, want to leave the
country?'' asks Raimundo Garcia, a Protestant minister in Elian's
hometown of Cardenas, 90 miles east of Havana. ``Our solution is
not to leave for the United States. We have to be capable of
putting our country together.''
</P>
<P>
   Such arguments carry little weight with many who no longer feel
they have a stake in this society and don't want to endure the long
wait for things to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally hope Elian never comes back,'' said Michael, a
young man sitting at a cafe along the Maecon, Havana's seafront
promenade, giving voice to what amounts to blasphemy in Cuba. ``He
should be like Moses for us: parting the waters so we can all walk
to the promised land.''

BUDGET PLAN SHARPLY SCALES BACK NEW YORK CITY TAX CUTS
</HEADLINE>
 By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a gesture of compromise to the City Council, Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani proposed a $36.7 billion city budget on Tuesday in
which he sharply scaled back his earlier proposal for tax cuts and
restored spending cuts he had proposed for libraries and other
cultural institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's budget proposal also called for several large new
capital projects over the next three years, including $348 million
for a new ambulatory care building, a children's center and a
police laboratory for analyzing DNA evidence, all at Bellevue
Hospital Center, and $96 million for an expansion of Lincoln
Center.
</P>
<P>
   The revised proposal signaled major concessions to the council
even before final budget negotiations, said Ronnie Lowenstein,
chief economist of the city's Independent Budget Office, a
nonpartisan watchdog group. ``This is a very big change from what
he was seeking in January,'' she said. ``He is not just saying here
are a few small things. He's cutting his tax cuts in half.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani on Tuesday projected a record $2.9 billion budget
surplus in the year that ends June 30. In January he said he
intended to use any surplus to eliminate two widely disdained city
taxes _ the commercial rent tax and the 14 percent personal income
tax surcharge _ as the cornerstones of his 2001 budget. The total
tax cuts would have amounted to $1.8 billion over three years.
</P>
<P>
   But instead, apparently in a bow to budget watchdogs like the
comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, who has warned that an economic
downturn and pending labor contract negotiations could squeeze city
resources next year, he pared his tax cuts nearly in half.
</P>
<P>
   Under his proposal on Tuesday, the income tax surcharge would be
reduced by half, to 7 percent. Giuliani still proposes ending the
commercial rent tax and a flat $2-per-night fee imposed on hotel
guests. He said these tax cuts would total $1 billion over three
years, about $800,000 less than his original proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has also restored $50 million for libraries, museums
and other cultural institutions that he had sought to cut,
provoking an outcry from the council. In other spending, his plan
would set aside $64 million for summer school and $108 million for
air-conditioning in classrooms. It also includes $60 million in
federal funds to expand the police force by 1,230 officers next
year, to 41,440.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor used a City Hall budget address on Tuesday to repeat
his call for the widespread use of merit pay to motivate teachers
and municipal workers.
</P>
<P>
   His budget would set aside a merit pay reserve of $325 million
in 2001, which would grow to $800 million in 2003 and remain
constant in succeeding years.

KINGS SEARCHING FOR A SPARK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Kings weren't supposed to beat the Detroit Red
Wings. The thinking was if they won a game or two, the Kings could
look back at their season as an overwhelming success and the start
of something special.
</P>
<P>
   But on the brink of elimination in just four games, Kings coach
Andy Murray is questioning that theory. Certainly a victory tonight
in Game 4 at Staples Center would give the players a boost. The
Kings have dropped 11 consecutive playoff games dating back to
1993.
</P>
<P>
   It is not so certain what kind of team the Kings will have when
they reach training camp next September. There is an expansion
draft this summer. Players are at the end of contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard a lot about how this is all part of the process,
and how we are building toward the future,'' Murray said. ``But I'm
not sure if this isn't our best chance to win is now.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray might just be trying one last motivational tool on his
players during an almost impossible situation. Only two teams in
NHL playoff history have come back from 0-3 deficits, the 1943
Toronto Maples Leafs and the 1975 New York Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   A more immediate concern has been the poor series of top players
Rob Blake and Glen Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, the second-leading goal scorer this season (29), has
been shut down completely by the Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   More alarming is Blake, the team captain and best player who
appears overwhelmed by the pressure of carrying a team that has
been to the playoffs just twice in the last seven years.
</P>
<P>
   He is the point man on a power play that is scoreless in 16
attempts against Detroit. Monday night, the Kings were 0 for 7.
During a four-minute power play after a Darren McCarty misconduct
penalty in the second period, the Kings had just one shot on goal.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, in a first-round sweep by St. Louis, the Blues
were 8 for 36 on the power play, the Kings 1 for 29. This year, the
Red Wings are 5 for 19, including both goals Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Blake's inability to jump-start the power play was compounded in
Game 3 by his cross-checking penalty on Tomas Holmstrom at the 4:59
mark of the first period. Blake's shot to Holmstrom's neck was in
retaliation for Holmstrom's cross check just moments earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But it gave Detroit a 5 on 3 advantage and Sergei Fedorov scored
just 22 seconds later.
</P>
<P>
   Only Holmstrom's earlier action, and some play acting on Blake's
hit, is expected to spare Blake from disciplinary action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure the guys who took the retaliation penalties last
night went home and said what the heck was I doing,'' Murray said.
``We all take responsibility for what is going on in this series
and the bottom line is it is very frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the series, the Kings have been able to point to the
close scores with some pride. After all, they were playing Detroit,
which finished with 108 points during the regular season and has
won two of the last three Stanley Cups.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a great team, they play well together and that is why
they have won the Stanley Cup,'' Luc Robitaille said Tuesday.
``They don't beat themselves. That is something we have to learn;
we have 24 to 30 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   But even the Red Wings can be vulnerable. After sweeping the
Mighty Ducks in the first round last season, Detroit took the first
two games against Colorado in the next round. Starting goaltender
Chris Osgood injured a knee, but the Red Wings jumped out to a 2-0
lead in Game 3. Then Fedorov fired a shot that hit the post. The
Red Wings lost the game and the next three.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a way the Kings could make it happen again?
Surprisingly, a voice from the Red Wings bench says anything is
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit assistant Dave Lewis, a former King who scored a goal in
the famous 1982 ``Miracle on Manchester'' playoff game vs.
Edmonton, played for the Islanders in 1975 when they came back to
beat Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``You break it down and keep it simple,'' he said. ``You have to
win all the little battles. It starts from the first faceoff and
goes to the next faceoff. It's a challenge to the players and it's
a challenge to the team. But that is the only way to do it.''

WETTELAND WONDERS WHAT WENT WRONG

<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Rangers closer John Wetteland spent Monday
night ``wracking my brains out.''
</P>
<P>
   Closers must cope with failure. Those who don't will not survive
in their world of high-pressure specialization.
</P>
<P>
   Answers, though, often can't be found.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland uncovered none after failing to preserve a one-run,
ninth-inning lead for the second time in as many days.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the game, I was wracking my brains out,'' said
Wetteland, who converted 18 consecutive save opportunities before
Sunday's loss in Cleveland and Monday's ninth-inning collapse
during the Yankees' 5-4 victory in 11 innings at The Ballpark in
Arlington. ``What could I have done differently? How could I have
done better? I really didn't come up with an answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland, though, copes well with the bumps and potholes
closers must endure through the course of a 162-game schedule. He
entered the clubhouse yesterday afternoon with his usual good humor
intact and enjoyed his late-afternoon, conditioning skate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got be truthful, though,'' he said. ``I'm affected by it.
I'm affected in that it stinks with the games Esteban \RLoaiza\S
and Darren \ROliver\S threw and in the fact I didn't do my job.
Yet, I also have to weigh whether it was from a lack of
preparation? No. Was it from a lack of application? No. Was it from
a lack of execution? Not really.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland took a plan to the mound, made his pitches and stayed
the course.
</P>
<P>
   ``My stuff was good \RMonday\S night,'' he said. ``The
application was there. The execution was there. It just didn't
work. That's an intangible that happens in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland refused to use his recent workload as an alibi.
Wetteland pitched four consecutive days for only the fourth time in
his career and for the first time since the 1998 season. Yet, he
threw only 37 pitches during his three appearances before Monday's
ninth-inning entrance.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's always been one of my strong suits,'' Wetteland said.
``In fact, I had better stuff \RMonday\S night than I had
\RSunday\S.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland would not pitch last night after four consecutive
appearances. Rangers manager Johnny Oates planned to call upon
right-hander Jeff Zimmerman should a save opportunity presented
itself.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I've blown two in two days,'' Wetteland said. ``Sadly,
I've been through that before. You just continue to work. I've
never seen anyone get worse from hard work.''

<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Rangers could be in a six-team American
League Central if the current realignment proposal passes at the
next meeting of major-league owners in June. That would also mean
four teams in the Western Division and four teams in the East.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers pitcher Rick Helling, a member of the Players
Association executive committee, said he thinks baseball should
consider six five-team divisions _ three in each league _ even if
it means an interleague game every night.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't bother me,'' Helling said. ``I don't think it
would bother any player as long as the travel is relatively the
same.
</P>
<P>
   As for the 4-6-4 alignment, Helling said, ``Geography is the
main plus. The minuses are obvious. We'd have five other teams we'd
have to beat out in the division. As much as they want to
rationalize it, it's much harder for those teams to win a division
title and get in the playoffs.'' \Nsubheds:Central move still
important Rangers vice president John McMichael, who represented
the Rangers at Monday's owners meetings, said the club still wants
to move to a division within the Central time zone. There had been
some speculation the Rangers were no longer concerned about that
since they had sold their television rights to Fox for the next
10-15 years and were no longer worried about late-night ratings
from the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure we feel as strongly as we used to,'' McMichael
admitted. ``Obviously, when you sell your rights, it has less of a
direct impact. But obviously our rights-holders have paid a lot of
money and we want to preserve the value. Plus, having an unbalanced
schedule and a lot of games on the West Coast hurts us in
generating fan interest and promoting home games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' main goal from realignment is interleague games
with the Houston Astros.  &QL; 
Las Vegas watch
</P>
<P>
   John McMichael said six teams, including the Rangers, remain
interested in moving their spring training base to Las Vegas in
2002, and probably will resume financial negotiations with city
officials next week.
</P>
<P>
   McMichael said he's also staying in contact with Charlotte
County, Fla., officials and is waiting to see what improvements can
be made to the Rangers' Port Charlotte facility. Much depends on a
bill pending in the state Legislature that would provide funds to
improve Florida spring-training facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see how the economics go with Las Vegas, if it makes
them a top contender,'' McMichael said. ``Certainly, both sites are
getting much attention.''  &QL; 
Lineup matters
</P>
<P>
   News flashes from the Rangers' lineup:
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Palmeiro made his fourth consecutive start at first base
yesterday. Manager Johnny Oates said David Segui will start there
today and Palmeiro will DH.
</P>
<P>
   Oates is planning to give catcher Ivan Rodriguez the day off as
well. Bill Haselman is scheduled to start for the second time this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Oates is also planning to give Jason McDonald his first start.
He'll play left field and give Chad Curtis a rest.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Frank Catalanotto, sidelined with a strained
groin muscle, said he is ``close,'' but trainer Danny Wheat wants
Catalanotto to wait until Friday before he returns to the field.
Catalanotto, available for pinch-hitting duties, said, ``I'm pretty
frustrated. I'm trying to will myself back in there.''  &QL; 
Minor matters
</P>
<P>
   News flashes for the minor leagues:
</P>
<P>
   Triple-A pitcher Brian Sikorski has cleared outright waivers and
been assigned to the Oklahoma Redhawks. He was taken off the 40-man
roster when the Rangers purchased the contract of Jason McDonald on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Redhawks third baseman Mike Lamb, whose defense was a concern in
spring training, committed three errors in an 11-4 loss to
Albuquerque on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa first baseman Carlos Pena, the Rangers' first-round draft
pick in 1998, has 16 runs batted in during the Drillers' first 12
games.

SAFETY OF EGGS TAKING A BEATING AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By KIM SEVERSON 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The egg, a kitchen workhorse delivered in one of nature's most
ingenious packages, is getting beaten up again.
</P>
<P>
   Having survived the cholesterol scare of the '90s, the egg is
facing perhaps a tougher foe: President Clinton's Egg Safety Action
Plan.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to eradicate Salmonella enteritidis, a relatively
new strain of the bacteria that first showed up in eggs on the East
Coast during the 1980s and has made hundreds of thousands of people
sick.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, details of which are still being finalized, could
possibly lead to wholesale pasteurization of the nation's egg
supply _ a change as radical as the campaign to pasteurize milk 80
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the effort, the government plans to teach America to
rethink how it cooks the 68 billion eggs eaten annually. That means
no more eggs over easy, and changes in recipes for everything from
ice cream and meringue to hollandaise sauce and Caesar salads.
</P>
<P>
   But critics of the president's egg policy say the government is
caught up in a shell game that pits egg farmers against consumer
activists. The fight against Salmonella enteritidis is about five
years too late, they say. The rate of illness from this bacteria
has already dropped and is continuing to do so. Rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   At a federal hearing in Sacramento earlier this month,
government officials said that from 1996 to 1998, the number of
Salmonella enteritidis-related illnesses cases fell by 44 percent,
to about 230,000 a year. In the past 15 years, 79 deaths have been
attributed to Salmonella enteritidis
</P>
<P>
   By its own estimates, the government believes that only 1 in
20,000 eggs contains Salmonella enteritidis, which can be killed
simply by cooking eggs so they are no longer runny. Opponents like
to point out that at a rate of five deaths a year, fewer people die
from eating Salmonella enteritidis-tainted eggs than from lightning
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Ernst, a poultry specialist in the animal sciences
department of University of California at Davis, said: ``If you
drive to the store to get eggs, you're taking a much greater risk
than eating those eggs raw. So how much time do you want to spend
worrying about eggs?''
</P>
<P>
   The president's policy and the rush to pasteurize eggs are
really about the politics of food safety, said Hans Reimann, a
recently retired UC Davis professor and one of the nation's top
authorities on egg-related safety and epidemiology.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going on here is sort of a media scare, and regulatory
agencies feel compelled to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Poultry researchers and farmers say the government is mounting a
major attack on Salmonella enteritidis  &LR; because it is a manageable
battle that can be won _ despite questions about the actual threat
of salmonella. ``The president said he was going to do it, so it
will be done,'' Ernst said.
</P>
<P>
   But to Laurie Girand, a Saratoga food activist whose daughter
fell ill in 1996 when she drank unpasteurized Odwalla juice
infected with E coli, arguments like that are industry doublespeak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of this as a power struggle between business wanting
to go on as usual and the consumers saying you can't make us sick
anymore,'' said Girand, who is part of a panel advising the
government on its new egg law. ``The truth of the matter is they're
bringing biohazards into the home in the form of an egg.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are fighting words to Petaluma Farms egg man Steve Mahrt.
He said he already goes to great lengths to keep his flock free
from Salmonella enteritidis. And if he is forced to pasteurize all
of his eggs in the shell, he'll be out of business. In-shell
pasteurizing machines just coming on the market cost as much as
$1.5 million, a price he can not afford.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they require pasteurization,'' he said, ``it would be the
end of family egg farms.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahrt and others say the real issue is a society that
increasingly demands the impossible: 100 percent risk-free food.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can cook it all to 170 degrees and not touch it, and
everything will taste like an old TV dinner,'' he said. ``The point
is, getting up in the morning is hazardous.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's egg plan calls for reducing the estimated 230,000
cases of Salmonella enteritidis poisoning by half by 2005 and
eliminate them entirely by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, the Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug
Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
plan to test egg farms for the bacteria. If it's found in chickens
or just in their hen houses, millions of eggs would either be
destroyed or sent for mass pasteurization.
</P>
<P>
   These are expensive propositions that involve either breaking
the eggs and pasteurizing them as a liquid for large-scale
food-service use or using a new and largely unproven technology
that would pasteurize them in the shell.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what, all egg cartons will soon bear cigarette-style
warning labels that read, in part, ``Eggs may contain harmful
bacteria known to cause serious illness.'' And consumers are
already being advised to cook all eggs until firm.
</P>
<P>
   If these efforts do not reduce illnesses caused by Salmonella
enteritidis-tainted eggs, the day may come when every egg in
America is either irradiated, pasteurized or produced by a
vaccinated chicken. It would mark a wholesale change, reminiscent
of time when pasteurizing milk became the law of the land early in
the century. The process eliminated the cream line and changed the
taste of whole milk.
</P>
<P>
   But eggs and milk are quite different. The shell is a safe
protective package, those opposed to mass pasteurization say, and
existing technology to pasteurize eggs changes their nature. Tests
in The Chronicle's kitchen substantiated those claims and showed
the pasteurized eggs did not perform as well as traditional eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Although no one can say why the rates of Salmonella enteritidis
related infections are dropping, Emilio Esteban, CDC assistant
director for public health, credits two things.
</P>
<P>
   One is that farmers and packers have started voluntary programs
to improve egg-handling practices. Second, health departments
orchestrated a public-education campaign designed to teach
restaurant workers and home cooks how to handle eggs properly to
avoid under cooking or contaminating other food with bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Salmonella enteritidis is a relative newcomer in the world of
food-borne pathogens, showing up inside eggs in the Northeast in
the early 1980s, then spreading to California _ particularly
Southern California _ in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the other estimated 2,000 commonly occurring strains of
salmonella, some of which live on the shells of eggs and are
controlled through egg washing, Salmonella enteritidis has a
peculiar trait: It lives inside, rather than outside, the egg
shell.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows why it cropped up or can make sense of its
infection patterns. In general, deaths attributed to Salmonella
enteritidis are rare.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1985, when the Salmonella enteritidis epidemic began, 79
deaths have been linked to it _ 17 in California. Most cases have
been among the elderly or immune-compromised people in nursing
homes or hospitals who are more susceptible to the effects of
salmonella. By comparison, the Clinton administration estimates
that about 9,000 deaths a year are attributed to all types of food
poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with all the estimates is that the numbers get
softer the harder one looks. In fact, no one is sure how many
people get sick from Salmonella enteritidis, in large part because
many cases are not severe enough to get counted.
</P>
<P>
   Most healthy adults who eat a tainted egg probably will not get
sick. If they do, they probably will experience a case of diarrhea
or other flu-like symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   The president's egg plan still has a few more miles to travel
before it becomes law. Based on information gathered at the public
hearings and sent to the USDA, the rules will be polished, cost
estimates will be finalized and a draft will be issued by the end
of the year. Final rules should be in place by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the government effort to educate cooks about
handling eggs will continue, and state and federal health officials
hope the Salmonella enteritidis rates will keep declining.
</P>
<P>
   But until either all eggs are pasteurized _ the nation's first
mass-market brand is due to hit Northern California groceries later
this year _ or farmers figure out how to keep Salmonella
enteritidis out of their product, consumers will have to decide
just how much of a risk under-cooked eggs are.
</P>
<P>
   Activist Girand says the solution is to fix the egg and farm
practices, not just to educate the consumer or rely on people who
cook food at restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, egg farmers say the new regulations will
unfairly burden smaller producers. The basic science behind the new
policy is unsound, they argue. And the bottom line is that the egg
itself is a safe, wholesome part of America's diet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a perfect food in its own excellent natural container,''
said Mahrt, the Petaluma egg farmer. ``Everybody's shooting at it,
but it survived the cholesterol scare _ and it can survive this.''

N.Y. TO CRACK DOWN ON STANDING WATER IN WAR AGAINST WEST NILE
VIRUS
</HEADLINE>
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York City Board of Health passed a resolution
on Tuesday declaring large puddles of water an official public
nuisance, and empowered the Departments of Health and Sanitation to
remove any receptacle containing standing water without warning its
owners.
</P>
<P>
   Effective immediately, if city workers stumble upon mountains of
tires, dirty bird baths, foul kiddie pools or other bodies of still
water that may attract mosquitoes, they will remove them quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution, however subtle, is evidence of how last year's
outbreak of the West Nile virus is affecting public health policy
and the activities of city agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, New Yorkers were required to remove accumulations of
water where mosquitoes were likely to breed. But the city was
required to declare the body of water a public nuisance and give
the person it belonged to some chance to remove it.
</P>
<P>
   But that process was too slow, given how fast mosquitoes mature
in an ideal breeding place _ about one week _ said a health
department spokesman, John Gadd. Under the new resolution, if a
receptacle containing standing water is removed by the city, the
property owner may be fined or charged for the cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   The health department hopes that its public information campaign
encouraging residents to clean up their yards will make it
unnecessary to raid yards for tires and the like.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, which will also encourage New Yorkers to use bug
spray and wear long sleeves at night, is one of many steps the city
embarked on this week to prevent a reoccurrence of West Nile, the
mosquito-borne virus that can cause swelling of the brain. The
virus killed seven people and sickened 62 in the metropolitan
region last year.

OWNER OF CHEMICAL DUMPER GAVE TO N.Y. MAYOR
</HEADLINE>
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Renco Group, a New York-based company whose
holdings include a Utah company that was identified by federal
environmental officials as the No. 1 toxic chemical dumper in the
nation in 1998, donated $100,000 to the soft-money campaign
committee set up to help Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, according to
federal records.
</P>
<P>
   The contribution was made to the Giuliani Victory Committee,
which was set up to allow Giuliani to skirt federal fund-raising
restrictions in his Senate race. Giuliani's opponent, Hillary
Rodham Clinton, has set up a similar soft-money committee to aid
her campaign. Renco owns Magnesium Corp. of America, which was
cited in a 1998 report by the Environmental Protection Agency on
the dumping of toxic chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure, contained in campaign reports filed in
Washington, came as Clinton campaigned in the Adirondacks raising
questions about Giuliani's environmental record, a theme she plans
to return to on Wednesday in a trip to Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Donated to Giuliani's victory committee, the money was
transferred to the National Republican Senatorial Committee.
Generally the national Republican committee would use the money
over the next year to finance advertisements and get-out-the-vote
efforts to advance Giuliani's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's campaign spokeswoman, Kim Serafin, referred questions
about the donation to the senatorial committee in Washington.
Stuart Roy, a spokesman for the national Senate fund-raising
committee, said it would be unfair for Democrats to try to hold
Giuliani responsible for the donation because it had been made to
the national committee, even though the check was made out to the
Giuliani Victory Committee.

METS' BATS DELIVER THAT FIRST VICTORY TO HAMPTON
</HEADLINE>
  By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This was baseball like it ought to be, at least for
the 2000 version of the Mets. Edgardo Alfonzo was driving balls to
the opposite field. Mike Hampton was in command and getting
ground-ball outs. Robin Ventura was hitting a grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets defeated the Milwaukee Brewers last night, 10-7, in a
game that, despite a ninth-inning scare, was played the way the
Mets' front office envisioned when it put together this season's
team.
</P>
<P>
   There was even vintage weather for the occasion. Last weekend,
the Mets sweltered on the artificial turf at Three Rivers Stadium
in Pittsburgh. Last night, they played in 48-degree temperatures
with an unforgiving 20-mph wind blowing straight to right field at
Shea Stadium. The Mets are used to such weather; the last time they
were in New York, on April 9, their game was postponed because of
snow.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, who was batting .152 and said, ``I stink'' before the
Mets began their series in Pittsburgh last Friday, capped a torrid
few days with his first grand slam of the season in the fourth
inning. It was the 14th slam of his career, putting him above
Harold Baines, Ken Griffey Jr. and Mark McGwire on the active list
and putting him into a ninth-place tie, with Gil Hodges, on the
career list. He is a .362 career hitter with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, who has eight hits in his last 17 at-bats, came up in
the fourth with two outs. He had hit only .167 in his career
against Jaime Navarro, the Brewers pitcher, but Navarro was a much
different pitcher than when the two faced each other in the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In the first three years of a four-year, $20 million contract
signed with the Chicago White Sox before the 1997 season, Navarro
lost more games in the majors (43) than any other pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   He lacks the off-speed pitches to complement his fastball, which
is usually in the range of 85-88 mph, and has struggled again this
year.
</P>
<P>
   After walking two hitters to load the bases _ one of Alfonzo's
three doubles came between the walks _ Navarro fell behind Ventura,
two balls and no strikes. Navarro followed with an 88-mph fastball,
and Ventura jumped on it, rifling the pitch high over the wall in
right field. It was the first ball Ventura had sent over the fence
with the bases loaded since his famous ``grand single'' that beat
the Atlanta Braves in the fifth game of the National League
Championship Series last October.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura was cheered by the small but hearty crowd, which was
announced as 17,905 but was significantly smaller. He was removed
from the game after six innings, as were two other starters.
Hampton stayed in; he has not enjoyed this kind of success since
spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, who went 22-4 for the Houston Astros last season, lost
his first three starts for the Mets as he struggled with his
control. Hampton walked 17 in 13 and two-thirds innings in those
games, but he said his problems were more mental than physical. He
and Dave Wallace, the Mets' pitching coach, both believed Hampton
was thinking too much, trying too hard in an effort to succeed in
his new surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   He was given a four-run Tuesday last night when the Mets scored
four times off Navarro in the first inning. After Jon Nunnally
blooped a leadoff double, Alfonzo, Mike Piazza and Todd Zeile all
had run-scoring hits. Jay Payton knocked in the other run in the
first with a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, blowing on his hands and rubbing up the ball throughout
the night, was shaky in the second inning, walking three and
allowing a two-run single to Raul Casanova. But he was stingy after
that, retiring 17 of the next 19 hitters and erasing the two
runners who reached base on double-play grounders.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers touched Hampton for three runs with two outs in the
eighth, chasing Hampton when Jose Hernandez delivered a two-run
single that cut the Mets' lead to 10-5. It was a nervous 10-7
before Armando Benitez got three outs and a save in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   For the night, Hampton worked seven and two-thirds innings,
allowing five runs on six hits and six walks, striking out seven.
</P>
<P>
   Like Hampton, the second baseman Alfonzo had struggled this year
after enjoying the best season of his career in 1999. He has been
stellar in the field, but his hitting has slumped, partly because
of his inability to hit the ball to right field.
</P>
<P>
   But Alfonzo hit two doubles there Tuesday night, and had his
first three-hit game of the season.

   On this date in 1836, Texas won its independence from Mexico at
the Battle of San Jacinto near what would become the city of
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Also on this date in 1918, German flying ace Manfred von
Richtofen was shot down during the World War I battle of the Somme
after amassing the most ``kills`` by any flier in history _ 80.
What was Richtofen's nickname? &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If you like California pinor noir but want to win your
independence from the simplistic, strawberry-juice-in-the-bottle,
give the 1997 Crichton Hall Pinot Noir _ 4 1/2 stars _ a try.
Though chockful of good acidity and some tannins right now, with
deep, bing-cherry and cinnamon flavors, this wine is worth laying
away for a year or two.
</P>
<P>
   The wine, frankly, reminded me of burgundy. But from the Cote de

   ``It's a `cote' of many colors,'' co-owner Judith Crichton said.
</P>
<P>
   About $27.99.

<P>
   Crichton Hall also makes a fine, not-overoaked 1997 Chardonnay _
4 stars _ which is around $17 (great food wine) and a rich, complex
1997 Merlot _ 4 1/2 stars _ which is drinking well now but will age

 &HT;    Floor collapses, 3 hurt at work site in Ohio
 &HT;    By Christine Vasconez
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ In a daring rope and crane rescue, Dayton
firefighters saved a construction worker's life Tuesday afternoon
at a downtown RTA construction site where a floor collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   As Michael Reno, 29, floated in and out of consciousness, he
dangled in a wire basket stories above a crane operator who gently
lifted him to safety from an area where the floor had collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never done a rope rescue,'' said Tom Bourquin, a 23-year
veteran Dayton firefighter trained in urban and search rescue. ``I
feel pretty good. I've been training for 12 years and got to use
our skills today, everything went like it was supposed to.''
</P>
<P>
   Crane operator Rick Masters, who maneuvered the wire cable and
hook inside the building and removed Reno, said ``Anytime someone
gets hurt it's scary. There's a big trust factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno was in fair condition at Miami Valley Hospital on Tuesday
night with a fractured and dislocated elbow. He and two other
construction workers were cutting through the concrete second floor
of a stairwell as part of an RTA renovation of the historic
13-story American building.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Lee, 23, was in the Intensive Care Unit at Miami Valley in
critical condition with a fractured skull.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Deel, 42, is in stable condition with a fractured arm and
abrasions at Franciscan Medical Center. Firefighters removed both
men through a nearby doorway.
</P>
<P>
   At approximately 1:48 p.m., the three construction workers stood
on the second story sawing off sections of the 12-by-12 floor. They
already had removed the 11 floors above them in work done weeks
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The three workers fell 15 feet to the first floor after the
8-inch thick concrete floor, which had been supported by a
temporary beam, collapsed, said James Denton, safety specialist
with Occupational Safety and Health Administration in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   After rescuing Deel and Lee, firefighters realized Reno was
trapped on the other side of the floor, which nearly became a
vertical wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got there the big slab of concrete was between us and
him,'' Bourquin said. ``Our first thought was to secure the slab,
but we decided to use the crane and basket through the top of the
building.''
</P>
<P>
   Dayton firefighter Mark Huff crawled around the unstable slab to
assess Reno's injuries. Reno was drifting in and out of
consciousness, Bourquin said.
</P>
<P>
   Noticing that his condition was deteriorating,
firefighter/paramedic Phil Myers and firefighter Ray Bush, both
trained in rope rescue, quickly rappelled from a section of the
second floor into what had become a pit.
</P>
<P>
   They carefully put a protective collar around Reno's neck and
lifted him onto a backboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had one doing patient care, then lowered a second to help,
the third firefighter packaged him up'' in the basket, Bourquin
said. ``It was like a little courtyard and the only access was from
the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno, in the basket, was hooked to the crane and Bourquin, who
was standing on another section of the second floor gave hand
signals to a foreman. The foreman motioned to the crane operator to
slowly pull the basket out of the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Reno was put in an ambulance while the rope rescue team was
hoisted out of the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Denton said the three workers had removed the third floor last
week and had no problems.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 to 60 workers have been working at the site, where
renovation started two months ago.

FOR THE KNICKS, AN IMPORTANT MEANINGLESS VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The outcome was meaningless in the playoff standing,
but the Knicks did some work toward patching up their tattered
self-esteem Tuesday night in a 100-88 victory against the Detroit
Pistons.
</P>
<P>
   It was far from a dominating performance by the Knicks _ and the
Pistons didn't play Jerry Stackhouse in the fourth quarter _ but
the team learned to count on the touch of Allan Houston (29 points)
again and rely on the energy of Latrell Sprewell (16 points, 5
assists) once more in front of a relieved crowd at Madison Square
Garden.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't sure what they would see after the Knicks had been
so thoroughly beaten up over the last week. But the Knicks (50-31)
were able to create a 13-point fourth-quarter lead, survive an 11-4
run by the Pistons with a couple of timely jumpers from Houston and
cool off the comeback threat by a Detroit team playing without its
superstar.
</P>
<P>
   Although the playoff positions had been decided for both teams,
and Grant Hill was looking on from the sideline because of an ankle
injury, the Knicks saw this game as important to their mental
state.
</P>
<P>
   In their last two games, the Knicks trailed by 20-plus points
and lost in double-digit humiliations to Toronto and Cleveland. So
the Knicks wanted to use Tuesday night's game as a chance to regain
faith in themselves with only one regular-season game deft to play,
in Boston on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need our best players at their best going into the
playoffs,'' Coach Jeff Van Gundy said before the game. ``None of
our best players have played particularly well over the last few
games.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last week, Houston, Sprewell and Patrick Ewing have
looked languid and nonresponsive. Their shooting percentages have
plummeted and their defensive lapses have been disturbing. Some of
those same issues dogged the Knicks in the first half against
Detroit. Although Hill wasn't around to deflate them, Stackhouse
whirled around Houston to score 14 points. Houston countered with
14 points of his own by aggressively driving to the basket and
getting to the free-throw line, but his defense was again suspect.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't the only one struggling, though. The Knicks allowed
the Pistons to shoot 48.4 percent and were outrebounded, 19-14.
They were able to tie the Pistons, 47-47, at the half after forcing
the Pistons into 11 first-hal&AMP; turnovers and shooting 50 percent
themselves, but this was not the spirited effort the Knicks wanted.
</P>
<P>
   They came out''in the third quarter much more focused. After
scoring just 5 points in the first half, Ewing was more lively on
offense and active on the boards and helped give the Knicks a 62-54
lead with 6 minutes 7 seconds left in the third. Then, after a
turnover, Sprewell converted the Pistons' mistake into a
crowd-pleasing dunk to put the Knicks ahead, 69-56.
</P>
<P>
   The energy(was back. It didn't matter if their high-voltage
forward Marcus Camby was out with a sprained knee, they had others
step into his place. Kurt Thomas leaped up and swatted away a
driving layup by John Crotty, which resulted in an open 3-pointer
for Houston in transition.
</P>
<P>
   He popped it. And the confidence Houston had been lacking for
the last several games seemed on track again as the Knicks surged
ahead, 75-62, at the end of the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   At least for an impressive third quarter, there were signs the
Knicks were motivated again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, you have to wait on the players,'' Van Gundy said.
``Sometimes, you have to wait until they're ready. We've got to get
back on track.''

SETTING IS RIPE FOR UPSETS, SWEEPS AND FITS, TOO
</HEADLINE>
  By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After one week, the Stanley Cup playoffs have provided a lot of
goals in several games, strange goals in some games and one grand
episode of bizarre behavior by a goalie.
</P>
<P>
   As for team themes, the whiney Washington Capitals are on the
verge of being upset in the Eastern Conference while the St. Louis
Blues are helping the San Jose Sharks in their quest for a similar
upset in the West. And the Toronto Maple Leafs are lucky their star
goalie is eligible to play Game 4 in Ottawa  &UR;  &LR; on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The goalie, Curtis Joseph, thought Ottawa forward Daniel
Alfredsson had interfered with him on the winning goal in the
Senators' 4-3 victory Monday night. Joseph protested by jumping up
and down, throwing pieces of his equipment and skating in a
threatening manner toward Referee Mick McGeough.
</P>
<P>
   Although the referee raised his hand in the manner of a traffic
cop saying ``Stop!'' the goalie kept charging. He lost his balance
and fell into McGeough's legs, knocking the referee on top of him.
</P>
<P>
   McGeough could have thrown Joseph out of the game. Instead, he
just gave the goalie a 10-minute misconduct, which was served by
another player. The league could have suspended Joseph on Tuesday
but no announcement was made, a strong suggestion that Joseph will
play Wednesday night in Ottawa, with Toronto leading the
four-of-seven-game series two games to one.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph saw humor in his behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty funny,'' he said. ``I didn't mean to fall. It's best
you laugh about it today. I don't think I should be suspended. I
lost my balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph said the league did not talk to him about the issue but
to Pat Quinn, Toronto's coach, who often complains about goalie
interference. Quinn said: ``I'm boxed in. I have no comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Commenting freely earlier in his series was Ron Wilson, coach of
the Capitals, who trail the Penguins three games to none with Game
4 Wednesday night in Washington. It will be only the second game
there this series because a building conflict in Pittsburgh forced
the teams to play Games 2 and 3 in the Igloo. Usually, Washington,
as the higher finisher, would have gotten the home ice for Games 1
and 2.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson at first joked that he didn't mind playing all seven
games in Pittsburgh, a quote that surfaced on the Penguins'
bulletin board. He also said, more seriously, that his team would
be confident even if it lost Game 1 by 8-1. Then the Penguins
presented the Capitals and goalie Olaf Kolzig with a 7-0 calling
card in the opener.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Wilson complained that the referees favor Jaromir Jagr,
the Penguins' superstar. ``Every time a guy is down, Jagr comes
over to complain,'' Wilson said. ``The next time, we have a guy in
the box.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those guys is Chris Simon, Washington's leading
goal-scorer, who was suspended for Game 2 of the series for
cross-checking _ and is penalized frequently when he is eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson partly blames Referee Paul Stewart. ``He's too good for
the players,'' Wilson said. ``It's his game.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Buffalo-Philadelphia series, it was a video judge's game,
at least for one nondecision on the phantom goal scored by John
LeClair of the Flyers in Game 2. He put the puck through a hole in
the side of the net guarded by the Sabres' Dominik Hasek. The
Flyers led three games to one after losing to the Sabres, 3-2, in
Game 4 Tuesday night in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   The official explanation put out by the television spin machine
after Game 2 was that the illegality of LeClair's goal was visible
only on ESPN's camera mounted in the net, a view unavailable to
video judges until it was too late to nullify the goal. This is
disingenuous. A conclusive view, from high over the net, was
available immediately to the video judges. They simply overlooked
it.
</P>
<P>
   Strange goals are occurring in the Blues-Sharks series, too,
which San Jose leads two games to one. Four of the Sharks' goals
have gone in off Blues players. The most infamous was the one
defenseman Marc Bergevin accidentally threw into the net of his own
goalie, Roman Turek, as he tried to knock the puck behind the net
with his glove.
</P>
<P>
   After Monday's 2-1 victory, the Sharks were not ready to gloat.
Owen Nolan, the Sharks' captain, who scored both goals Monday, said
of the Blues: ``There is a reason why they are first overall in the
league. This series is far from over.''
</P>
<P>
   You can't say that about the Detroit-Los Angeles and the
Colorado-Phoenix series. The Red Wings lead 3-0 with Game 4 in Los
Angeles Tuesday night. Going for their third Stanley Cup in four
seasons, the Red Wings won an 8-5 red-light fiasco in between 2-0
and 2-1 squeakers. The Avalanche, also leading by 3-0, can
eliminate the Coyotes on Tuesday night. In the other Western
series, the Dallas Stars took a two-games-to-one lead into Game 4
at Edmonton Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Another strange goal came in the Devils-Florida Panthers series,
which New Jersey led, 3-0, after winning Game 3, 2-1, on Tuesday
night. It came in Game 1 when Peter Worrell, the Panthers' bruiser
who rarely scores, sent a 50-foot knuckler past Martin Brodeur into
the Devils' net.  &QL;

DEVILS CLOSER TO BANISHING PLAYOFF DEMONS 
BY ALEX YANNIS  
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNRISE, Fla. _ It took the Devils 12 manpower advantages before
they scored a power-play goal in the series against the Florida
Panthers. But the one Alexander Mogilny got Tuesday night in a 2-1
victory not only wiped out a 1-0 deficit but may have also erased
three straight years of early playoff futility for New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   By taking a commanding lead of three games to none in the
Eastern Conference quarterfinal series, the Devils put themselves
in position to eliminate the Panthers here on Thursday night and
advance to the second round. Only two teams in playoff history have
come back from 0-3 deficits to win a series: the 1942 Toronto Maple
Leafs and the 1975 Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   Mogilny's power-play goal, with 3 minutes 35 seconds left in the
second period, tied the game at 1-1. Brian Rafalski untied it for
the Devils with a blistering shot from the right point early in the
third period after Bobby Holik won a face-off. The Panthers'
goaltender, Mike Vernon, had little chance on Rafalski's shot, one
of 40 the Devils fired at him.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Brodeur, who faced only one shot in the second period and
22 in the game, played well in goal in the third period, when the
Panthers pressed for the equalizer. Brodeur allowed a goal to Ray
Whitney in the first period and nothing after that.
</P>
<P>
   With Scott Stevens leading the way, the Devils did another
masterful job of neutralizing Pavel Bure, whose 58 goals in the
regular season led the National Hockey League. Bure has been
limited to only three assists in the series, one in each game.
</P>
<P>
   In the 18 playoffs series the Devils have played, they have
never lost a series after winning the first two games. This is the
fifth time the team won the first two games and the players used
that element as motivation before Tuesday night's encounter.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils had a huge territorial advantage in the first two
sessions, but only managed Mogilny's power-play goal, their first
in 12 attempts in the series with the man advantage. The goal came
with 3:25 left in the second period on a shot from the right circle
that found its way past Vernon through a crowd in front. It offset
Whitney's first-period goal and tied the score.
</P>
<P>
   It also was one of the few times the Devils created traffic in
front of Vernon. The Panthers' goaltender was able to see most
shots taken from far out and he was helped because the Devils were
unable to get any second chances against Vernon as they failed to
go to the net in the first two periods.
</P>
<P>
   So huge was the Devils domination in the first 40 minutes,
though, that they had 31 shots at Vernon while limiting the
Panthers to seven at Brodeur. The lopsided play was most evident in
the second period, when the Panthers had only one shot attempt at
Brodeur.
</P>
<P>
   Florida had a marvelous chance to open the scoring during its
first manpower advantage, but Mark Parrish missed wide after a
crafty setup by Bure and Whitney also shot wide from close range on
the left moments later.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney succeeded, however, 9:19 into the game during a
two-on-one break with Mike Sillinger. With Brodeur looking at
Sillinger, who was holding the puck, Sillinger slipped a pass to
Whitney on the left for an easy goal in a sequence that was started
after Bure gained possession in the neutral zone.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Brylin was the forward the Devils used in a defensive
role a great deal against Bure in the first two games of the
series. But he missed Tuesday night's game with a bruised right
knee he sustained in the third period of Game 2, forcing Devils
Coach Larry Robinson to look for another forward to assume that
role.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Pandolfo stepped in, along with Stevens, who was the main
man the Devils had on the ice against Bure. It was an elbowing
penalty to Bure that lead to Mogilny's goal. Stevens started the
play that led to the goal with a pass to Rafalski, who found
Mogilny on the right wing; it was Mogilny's first goal in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   With no extra forwards available, the Devils promoted Steve
Kelly from Albany and he took Brylin's place at left wing with
Holik his center and Randy McKay the right wing. The Devils had a
choice of promoting either Steve Brule or Kelly and Lou Lamoriello
went with Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got some playoff experience,'' Lamoriello, the president
and general manager of the Devils, said before the game, referring
to the six games Kelly played in the playoffs with Edmonton in
1997. ``And he's also more adept at playing the left side.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said, ``I've played mostly center. I don't want to make an
impression here. All I want to do is play solid hockey.''

THE MARKET IS STILL MORE BULL THAN BEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Younger investors burned by the recent meltdown of the
new-economy stock market as represented by Nasdaq can't really say
they've been through their first bear market.
</P>
<P>
   Not yet, at least.
</P>
<P>
   If the tech-laden Nasdaq rallies from Friday's close and
rebounds from its recent staggering losses, it will not qualify as
a bear market. To be sure, it qualifies technically by dint of
losing more than one-third of its value because a 20 percent
decline officially denotes bear territory.
</P>
<P>
   Real bear markets, however, go beyond mere numbers that quantify
the magnitude of a market index's fall. Bear markets grind your
spirit into the dust. The worst bear markets destroy hope for the
future and end only when nobody believes things will ever get
better.
</P>
<P>
   Times and technology may change, but market psychology doesn't.
The new-economy cognoscenti say information transmission times have
telescoped to the point that even world-shaking events don't take
nearly as long to play out as they once did. Perhaps that is so in
some cases, but it isn't when financial markets reverse direction.
</P>
<P>
   Bear markets can't occur until bull markets have run their
course, and vice versa. Both bear and bull markets are as much
psychological as economic phenomena because both have as much to do
with emotion as money. The old saying about stock markets being
moved by fear and greed gets at this critical psychological
characteristic.
</P>
<P>
   One reason this bull market has run so long is the dearth of
players who have been psychologically scarred by a brutal bear
market. The last one occurred in the '70s, and none of the
relatively few survivors has fully recovered psychologically.
They've been recognizable over the past decade as those who haven't
fully participated in the wild run to riches offered by the stock
market in general and the new-economy Nasdaq in particular.
</P>
<P>
   If you look at the market charts after 1929 and 1969, they'll
tell you the '30s and '70s weren't one long bear market because the
averages rose and fell significantly during those time frames. In
the minds of those who experienced these two horrendous decades,
though, the up-down distinctions delineating bear and bull periods
are psychologically lost. For them, the '30s and '70s were a blur
of seemingly endless terrible times.
</P>
<P>
   Those dreadful experiences, however, set the stage for the
prosperity and roaring long-term bull markets that followed.
</P>
<P>
   They say there are two things you never get over. One is a
brutal physical beating and the other is a devastating bear market.
What makes a real bear market so devastating is what it does to
your psyche over a lengthy period of time. If you're heavily
involved in the market, it gets to the point where you think it'll
never end, that things will never get better.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have taken some hard lumps in the past few weeks may
think they've been bloodied in bear market combat, but they
haven't. For any down market to qualify for bearhood, it must last
long enough so it doesn't just wipe out a good part of your
treasured nest egg _ it also must destroy forever your blithe
spirit and marketplace innocence.

ASSURED OF HIS ROLE, POSADA SEIZES THE MOMENT 
BY BUSTER OLNEY  
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Watch Jorge Posada bounce to and from the
dugout for each inning. Listen closely to broadcasts of Yankee
games and the shouted voice you hear will belong to Posada. He will
be yelling at the pitcher to cover first, directing the infielders,
cussing vigorously. He is moving with exceptional energy, like a
colt released to pasture on the first day of spring.
</P>
<P>
   This is Posada's time, after years of waiting for the Yankees to
trust him with a full-blown opportunity, and Posada is seizing the
day. He had two hits Tuesday night, including a two-run homer, and
the Yankees dumped Texas, 6-3, for their seventh consecutive
victory; that matches their longest winning streaks of the 1999
season. Orlando Hernandez is 3-0 after four starts. He allowed
eight hits Tuesday night in the Yankees' first complete game of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   It was Posada who spurred the Yankees against the Royals last
Friday with a two-run homer. It was Posada who slammed an
extra-inning home run Monday and it was Posada who executed an
unassisted double play in the turning point of that game. In 13
games he is batting .311, with three homers, a team-high six
extra-base hits and 10 runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   After his first 13 games last year, Posada was batting .146,
mired in a slump he did not shake for more than three months. For
that and other reasons, Posada was the team's most significant
question mark when spring training began this year. He caught the
majority of games in 1998 and 1999, but the coaching staff relied
heavily on Joe Girardi, and when Girardi left for the Cubs as a
free agent and the Yankees were restructured for this season, the
front office took a calculated risk: It chose not to acquire
another healthy veteran catcher to back up Posada.
</P>
<P>
   It wanted Posada to come to spring training knowing with
certainty that he would be the catcher. It wanted Posada to
understand fully how much it believed in him, to know that he would
play every day, even if he had a bad day or two or more.
</P>
<P>
   Posada has responded. He guided Ramiro Mendoza through six and
one-third perfect innings Saturday. In the middle of a crisis
Monday night, Posada visited the mound and Cone looked at him and
asked, ``What do you think?'' It was not a question Cone would have
bothered with in the past.
</P>
<P>
   And Posada is hitting.
</P>
<P>
   He moves swiftly to and from his position each inning, the skull
cap bouncing on his head, carrying his glove in one hand and his
catcher's mask in the other. He is having immense fun.

 NETWORTH: BANK'S STOCK HAS PROMISING PROGNOSIS  &HT;     By KATHLEEN PENDER 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ One of the bigger victims of the tech-stock
correction isn't even a tech company. It's Silicon Valley
Bancshares.
</P>
<P>
   The parent of Silicon Valley Bank has always had an identity
crisis. Because its gets an equity stake in many client companies _
mostly tech and life sciences startups _ it's part &UR;  &LR; bank, part
venture capitalist, part &UR;  &LR; mutual fund.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, however, valued it pretty much like a bank until the
company issued its third-quarter report in October. At that time,
it became clear the bank had overcome some gnarly bad-loan problems
and was going to start raking in some big gains on its tech
investments.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the Santa Clara, Calif., bank became the new best
friend of momentum investors who were snapping up anything that
smelled like tech.
</P>
<P>
   The stock (SIVB) soared from $25 per share in mid-October to $90
on March 3.
</P>
<P>
   But like most fickle friends, the momentum crowd dropped it as
soon as the tech market started crumbling.
</P>
<P>
   It closed yesterday at $40.94, up $6.94 for the day but still
more than 50 percent below its peak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the stock is cheap,'' says Preston Athey, manager of
the T.Rowe Price Small Cap Value Fund. ``Fair value is something
like $60.'' Although he sold some shares last year, the bank is
still one of his five largest holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts also consider it undervalued but are waiting to
change their opinions until the company reports earnings tomorrow
and holds a conference call (open to the public) on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley Bank really consists of two pieces _ a bank and
an investment portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   The bank lends money to companies that have already received one
or two rounds of venture capital. The companies may not be
profitable, but they've usually started shipping products and have
accounts receivable or inventories they can use as collateral to
borrow money for working capital.
</P>
<P>
   The bank asks for _ and often gets _ warrants from its clients.
Similar to stock options, the warrants let the bank buy shares in
companies at a price similar to what venture capitalists get, which
is almost always below the IPO price.
</P>
<P>
   The bank has warrants in more than 900 client companies. It gets
to exercise the warrants _ or turn them into stock _ when the
company goes public or gets acquired. In the case of an IPO, the
bank sells the stock as soon as it can after the lockup period has
ended, and realizes the gain.
</P>
<P>
   As the Nasdaq soared and the IPO market boomed, so did the value
of the warrants.
</P>
<P>
   In the first three quarters of last year, the bank's income from
cashing in warrants was $8.7 million. In the fourth quarter, it was
$24.3 million. In the first two months of this year, it was $35
million.
</P>
<P>
   On March 20, the company was sitting on an additional $60.7
million worth of unrealized gains in stock it had not yet sold.
</P>
<P>
   The bank won't disclose which companies are still in its warrant
portfolio, or what they're worth, since there's no way of knowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only 15 to 20 percent of the warrants we take end up having
some value. Of that, maybe 1 or 2 percent are the large home
runs,'' says Chris Lutes, the bank's CFO.
</P>
<P>
   The bank values the warrants at cost _ just $1 per company, no
matter how many warrants.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its warrant portfolio, the bank also invests in
outside venture capital funds. In February, the bank had $30
million in gains from its VC investments.
</P>
<P>
   Because warrant and venture capital income is so unpredictable,
most analysts don't include it in their earnings estimates. And
until recently, most investors didn't pay it much heed.
</P>
<P>
   But ``a growing number of shareholders have been placing some
value on these unrealized gains,'' says analyst David Winton of
Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods. ``That's part of the reason (the stock)
sold off in sympathy with the Nasdaq.''
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders are especially worried about the bank's exposure to
the troubled dot-com sector. Lutes says the bank's investment in
business-to-consumer and business-to-business Internet companies
``is minimal. Most of our Internet lending is in the
backbone/infrastructure area.'' To ease concerns, the bank will
disclose its exposure to Internet companies for the first time
during Monday's conference call.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Nasdaq is on the mend, a relapse would hurt the
bank's warrant income because fewer companies would be able to go
public. On the upside, companies that couldn't sell stock would
probably borrow more money, and that would help the bank's core
business.
</P>
<P>
   But a prolonged slowdown in the tech sector could threaten its
loan portfolio. Startups have four ways to repay their loans:
through operations, going public, getting more venture capital or
selling out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If VCs became more picky and less apt to fund second, third
and fourth rounds, (the bank) could have some companies going out
of business,'' says Steve Didion, an analyst with Hoefer &AMP; Arnett.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't expect that to happen. And even if it did, Lutes
points out that the bank still has borrowers' collateral to fall
back on.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expect that the bank's operating earnings _ excluding
warrant income _ will be 80 cents for the first quarter and $3.30
for the full year. At $41 per share, the stock is trading at 12.4
times expected earnings.
</P>
<P>
   That's a bit high for a bank stock, but analysts point out that
Silicon Valley is growing much faster than the typical bank.
</P>
<P>
   T. Rowe Price's Athey calls it ``a pretty conservative way to
play the long term growth of technology with a really well-managed
company.''
</P>
<P>
   (Full disclosure: I own shares in Athey's fund in a &UR;  &LR; 401(k)
plan.)

 GAS PRICES DECLINE SLIGHTLY  &HT;     By VERNE KOPYTOFF 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Bay Area gas prices have declined a few cents a
gallon from their recent peak after last month's agreement by OPEC
countries to increase oil production, according to the latest
survey by the California State Automobile Association.
</P>
<P>
   Regular unleaded gas in San Francisco now costs an average of
$1.92 a gallon, down from a high of $1.94 a gallon on April 4. In
San Jose, Calif., gas has dipped to $1.85 a gallon from $1.88 a
gallon during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not much to be thankful for after seeing prices jump 35
cents over the last few months,'' said Paul Moreno, a spokesman for
the automobile association.
</P>
<P>
   What precipitated the decline in gas prices is last month's
agreement by OPEC ministers to increase oil production by 7
percent. Since then, the price of crude oil has dropped to nearly
$25 a barrel from nearly $35 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor is the relative health of California's oil
refineries, which produce just enough of the required
cleaner-burning fuel to supply the state. In the past, mechanical
problems at some of these refineries affected production and caused
gas prices to surge.
</P>
<P>
   Severin Borenstein, director of the Energy Institute at the
University of California at Berkeley, said it is not surprising
that gas prices have declined modestly. He said it takes six to
eight weeks for lower oil prices to fully reach the consumer at the
pump.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we will continue to see declining prices, though those
declines will be slowed some because of the summer driving
season,'' Borenstein said.
</P>
<P>
   By any measure, though, consumers are still paying nearly 40
cents a gallon more for gas than they did six months ago. It is
unclear what the latest price decline will have on proposals by
some state legislators to reduce gas prices by, among other things,
exempting the fuel from the state sales tax.

UNDERSTANDING OF TERRORISM'S METHODS AND PRACTITIONERS GROWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANON  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ Terrorists, say experts gathered for the fifth
anniversary of what people here refer to simply as ``the bombing,''
are more cunning than ever.
</P>
<P>
   They exist in ever smaller, more elusive groups. Their motives
are more complex and convoluted, their tactics more varied, the
technology at their disposal more lethal.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the good guys have learned a trick or two themselves.
</P>
<P>
   We understand terrorists _ if not well enough _ better all the
time. We know the simple things _ concrete barriers around key
public buildings, for example _ that make us safer. And time has
taught us which threats to take most seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't solve the problem of terrorism,'' said Brian
Jenkins, author of International Terrorism: A New Mode of Conflict.
``But we can keep the threat in perspective. Our lives are not
always in danger. The republic is not always in peril.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather, said the terrorism scholars and security experts
assembled in Oklahoma City, the struggle for domestic safety is an
ongoing arms war between society's civilized haves and angry
have-nots. It is mostly, they said, a war of smarts.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Oklahoma City will dedicate a memorial to the 168
persons killed April 19, 1995, when a rental truck filled with
fertilizer and fuel oil exploded at the front of the Murrah Federal
Building. Each day of the conference held by the Oklahoma City
National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism began
with a moment of silence ``for those who died, those who survived
and those whose lives were changed forever.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, because the bombing hit a Midwestern city rather
than Beirut or London or New York, experts said it made the entire
nation feel newly vulnerable to mass violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the bombing, Oklahomans thought for a long time that
terrorism happened in other places to other people,'' said Stephen
Sloan, a fellow with the institute and a University of Oklahoma
political scientist. ``We know better now.''
</P>
<P>
   And experts agree that the question is not whether the country
will suffer another deep wound from terrorism, but when and where
and how.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, those who study terrorism know their subject better.
Here, in simplified form, are a few of the conclusions being made
about terrorism and terrorists:
</P>
<P>
   - Nobody wakes up suddenly inspired to become a terrorist.
Terrorists are made during adolescence. And though they tend to
adopt political or religious philosophies that color their
violence, they often are drawn to terrorist groups for less noble
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, experts said, membership in a terrorist outfit offers
them prestige. Other times, as with factions of the Irish
Republican Army, it gives a high-minded cover to a form of
organized crime. In some cases, young men turn to terrorism because
their family has ties to the organization, or because it offers
them sanctuary, or because they see it as key to a group identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the police did something malicious to their mother, or
all their friends all belong, or they were the subject of an arrest
they believe was unfair,'' said Alison Jamieson, a terrorism
consultant who has studied members of the Red Brigades in Italy.
``Sometimes they join an organization they believe in and then
gradually fall into terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The striking thing is how accidental the process can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Understanding the factors that make terrorists makes it easier
to find them, Jamieson said.
</P>
<P>
   - In the early 1980s, most of the world's terrorism sprang from
revolutionary groups organized like small-scale armies, said
University of Alabama justice sciences professor Brent Smith.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``During the 1990s, indictments against
international terrorists average less than two persons per case.''
</P>
<P>
   Among right-wing extremists in the United States in particular,
the vogue is cells of ``leaderless resistance'' that insulate
loosely aligned radicals from investigation, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This model has been created specifically to thwart
prosecution,'' he said. Further, Smith said, America's right-wing
terrorists today are deeply devoted to their various
anti-government causes and ``less likely to turn state's evidence''
and inform on colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   - The danger of terrorists employing chemical, biological,
radiological or nuclear weapons is growing. The collapse of the
former Soviet Union, for instance, has fed a black market for
weapons of mass disruption.
</P>
<P>
   And though the experts said governments need to track such
threats, they remain the least likely to be unleashed by terrorists
because of the high costs and sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not look so far into the future that we lose sight
of the clear and present dangers of terrorists using high
explosives to inflict mass casualties,'' said John Parachini of the
Monterey Institute of International Studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flash of a bomb and the immediacy of it has an impact that
(unleashing) a disease does not,'' he said. ``For one thing, it
makes more clear who the target is.''
</P>
<P>
   Understanding that bombs and bullets pose the mostly likely
danger, Parachini said, tells governments to spend more money
girding against those conventional attacks.
</P>
<P>
   - Attacks on business hubs in urban areas _ like London's
financial center or New York's World Trade Center _ are taking on
new appeal among terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   John Gearson of the Department of War Studies at King's College
in London said that for terrorists, ``the ability to disrupt
economic activity rather than take human life remains a less
glamorous but potentially more effective choice.''
</P>
<P>
   The IRA believes, he said, that attacking the economy in London
was successful in getting the British to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   That knowledge, he said, can allow security experts to emphasize
defenses around the most attractive targets.
</P>
<P>
   Other terrorist tactics, though, were deemed strategic failures.
For years Timothy McVeigh trumpeted the twisted anti-government
manifesto played out in the pulp novel The Turner Diaries. In it,
the bombing of one federal building sets a match to the tinder for
coast-to-coast revolution.
</P>
<P>
   But McVeigh's bombing in Oklahoma City launched no such revolt,
noted Bruce Hoffman, a Rand Corp. terrorism expert.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, McVeigh deflated a lot of the militia groups,''
Hoffman said. ``He's probably the most reviled person in the
country today...
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been five years. Where's his revolution?''

 GROW A BUSINESS: STAFF INSPIRED TO KICK BUTT AND HAVE FUN  &HT;     By PETER SINTON 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR;   &LR; Business leaders these days are taking some
unusual steps to pump up sales and morale.
</P>
<P>
   Manish Mehta, who takes business seriously but not himself, is a
perfect example. The CEO of San Jose, Calif.'s ELetter Inc. took
his wife to buy black pumps late last year _ not for her, for him.
To spur his colleagues on to greater results, Mehta pledged he
would wear high heels to the office for an entire day if they could
meet an ambitious sales target.
</P>
<P>
   The venture-capital-backed company, which lets businesses send
out direct mailings quickly and cheaply without making employees
stuff envelopes or visit a post office, met Mehta's target and he
was on the hook.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be a successful and inexpensive incentive,
albeit embarrassing. Because he was going to wear the shoes only
once, Mehta purchased the pumps at Payless Shoes and spent most of
his workday sitting. Now, some employees have suggested that he
wear a dress to work if ELetter meets another milestone. Mehta
hasn't yet agreed to that proposal, but he says companies must be
as creative with their people as their products.
</P>
<P>
   ``A company's culture is very important,'' he says. ``You can
match other companies' offers to your employees, but to make them
stay, you have to make work fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Offbeat events, even if occasionally in questionable taste, are
one way to foster camaraderie. At Sun Microsystems, CEO Scott
McNealy adopted the motto ``Kick butt and have fun,'' and his
company has attracted attention for elaborate April Fools' Day
pranks. One year, Sun engineers constructed a golf course green in
McNealy's office, complete with water hazard.
</P>
<P>
   Demandline.com CEO Patrick Burns is another big believer in team
building. Two weeks ago, he told five of his top executives to meet
at the airport with cold-weather gear for a five-day trip to an
undisclosed destination. They flew to Alaska, connected with two
guides and climbed Matanuska Peak with ice axes and 70-pound
backpacks.
</P>
<P>
   Burns, who launched Demandline.com in June to let small
businesses band together to get better prices for
telecommunications, financial and other core services, views the
brief Alaska adventure as a metaphor for working at a startup:
``You can get blindsided at any time, and teamwork is essential.''
</P>
<P>
   Before getting an MBA at Kellogg Business School and veering
into technology, Burns planned to become a diplomat. ``You have to
be constantly innovating and creating challenges and value for your
people,'' he says. Surprise trips and parties are ``a retention and
recruiting tool.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Demandline.com held what it called a ``suitcase
party'' at O'Neill's Pub in San Mateo, Calif., for its 31 workers,
their spouses or dates. The winner of a drawing was sent for an
immediate three-day weekend at the Phoenician resort in Scottsdale,
Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   VENTURE CAPITAL SEARCH: Stock market charts lately look like the
EKGs of heart attack victims who have received a few defibrillator
jolts. Most initial public offerings have been put on hold, but
plenty of entrepreneurs with IPO visions are still lining up to win
venture capital financing.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday afternoon at the University of California at
Berkeley's Haas School of Business, eight finalists vying for more
than $70,000 in cash and prizes in the second annual business plan
competition heard RedGorilla.com founder and CEO John Witchel's
advice on ``How to ask for $5 million.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news, says Witchel, is that there is as much venture
capital money available today as there was a month ago _ billions
of dollars _ so ``Don't panic.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is increased emphasis on the ability to show a profit.
Until recently, Witchel says venture capital investors were willing
to fork over increasing amounts of money to meet specific
milestones, such as acquiring customers and getting products to
market. Now, ``the giveaway days are officially over,'' he says.
``If you don't have an intrinsically profitable model, watch out.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent market gyrations could make some business school students
more cautious about becoming high-tech entrepreneurs. Still, 182
teams entered this year's business plan contest. More than 60
venture capitalists whittled the list of contestants to these eight
finalists:
</P>
<P>
   Arrive on Time, a real-time, customized traffic information
service; Harmony123, a B2B investment information and education
company; Imagize, a maker of semiconductors for image-processing;
Infoprotection.com, a B2B service to maintain confidential files;
MechanEx, a maker of online product development tools; SkyFlow, a
developer of software for wireless applications; Somagenics, a
developer of gene-regulating compounds to treat disease; and
Sporteum, an electronic marketplace for the global sporting goods
industry.

 OAKLAND'S FIRMS RISING TO THE TOP  &HT;     By PETER SINTON 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Oakland, Calif., businesses took five of the top
25 spots on the second annual ranking of 100 inner-city businesses
by Inc. magazine and the Harvard Business School's Initiative for a
Competitive Inner City.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker Technology, an Oakland telecommunications installation
and maintenance firm, placed No. 3 with 1998 revenue of $3.1
million and a five-year growth rate of 4,843 percent. Cambria
Environmental Technology, Fast Track Litigation Support and Hamel
Group placed Nos. 18, 19 and 20, and Give Something Back placed No.
24. A sixth Oakland company, Lori Bonn Jewelry, placed No. 70 on
the list.
</P>
<P>
   Only Cleveland won more spots on the 100 list, with a total of
eight. In the Bay Area, San Francisco had two winners _ IQuantic,
No. 33, and AAA Business Supplies, No. 80.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than merely a list, the Inner City 100 is the most
ambitious project to uncover business successes in America's inner
cities,'' said Harvard Business School Professor Michael Porter,
who started the nonprofit Initiative for a Competitive Inner City
in 1994. ``The Inner City 100 are leading the economic rebirth
taking place in America's inner cities.''
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for the Inner City 100 awards, applicants must be
profitable businesses, with at least 10 employees, $1 million in
sales and a five-year operating history. They also must be located
in economically distressed urban areas where income is at least 50
percent lower than the local norm and unemployment is 50 percent
higher.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly mom-and-pop businesses, the 100 winners have median
annual sales of $4.7 million, a median workforce of 42 employees
and average compound annual growth rate of 50 percent. Forty-one
percent of Inner City 100 employees reside in the inner city and
their average hourly wage, excluding benefits, is $12.83. That
compares with the national private-sector average of $12.77 and is
150 percent more than the federal minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Tucker, founder and CEO of Tucker Technology, pays his 120
workers from $10 to $30 an hour to install telecommunications
systems, and median pay is close to $18 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   One of 11 Inner City 100 companies headed by an African
American, Tucker hires more than half of its employees from urban
core areas.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker was born in the Bronx and counseled prisoners at New York
City's Rykers Island prison after studying sociology in college.
Then he discovered he could earn twice as much money working for
the old New York Telephone and began his career in
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker's company hires about 15 percent of its employees through
links with community-based organizations such as Glide Memorial
Church and welfare-to-work programs. It also uses Laney College in
Oakland and other schools to find and train workers. And Tucker
hires skilled technicians from the Communications Workers of
America union who have either retired or lost their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker moved up from No. 4 on last year's Inner City 100 list to
No. 3. But it hasn't all been smooth sailing.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Tucker had to take time off from adding clients and
staff to replace four of his eight administrators and build a more
take-charge management team.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker used to run his company by telling his employees what to
do. That worked when the company was small. But as it grew to 120
employees from Hawaii to Ohio, Tucker found himself inundated by
everyone else's questions and unsolved problems. As a test, he left
a broken chair in the company's reception area and it remained
there for weeks before someone took the initiative to throw it
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like the `Wizard of Oz,' '' he recalls. ``Everyone was
looking for the wizard to solve their problems rather than taking
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Tucker has a poster on his wall pinpointing the evils of
``It's not my job'' and similar complacent thinking. And the
company is back on the growth path. It just landed a large contract
from Pacific Bell to install digital-subscriber line (DSL) service
in several South Bay and Southern California communities, which
could double Tucker's revenue and workforce.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Like other companies on the Inner City 100 list, Tucker said
proximity to a diverse labor force, public transportation and
cheaper real estate are all advantages of doing business in a core
urban area. Tucker's offices are located near the 12th Street
Station of the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) rail system.
</P>
<P>
   Fast Track Litigation Support, a newcomer on the Inner City 100,
is strategically located near BART's 19th Street Station. Company
founder Patricia Nieuwenhuizen said her location in the former
Neptune Orient Lines offices at Grand Avenue and Broadway is useful
for quick access to the company's law firm clients in San Francisco
and local colleges such as the University of California at
Berkeley, which supply many of the firm's 72 part-time workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employees can get to our offices easily and we can serve our
clients without paying exorbitant real estate prices,'' said
Nieuwenhuizen. Her rent of about $1.60 per square foot per month is
a fraction of what she figures she would be paying in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwenhuizen was a litigator before she started her own
computer services company to compile, store and index legal data
for corporate law departments and government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, IQuantic set up its compensation consulting
business at 17th and Harrison streets because owner Mark Edwards
liked ``not having to fight downtown traffic.'' Most of the
company's 40 employees live in the city and also like proximity to
Highway 101 for quicker access to Silicon Valley clients. IQuantic
fell from No. 18 on last year's list to No. 33 this year, but
Edwards said the company is likely to double in size this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Inner City 100 project received more than 900 nominations
this year. Nearly 30 percent of them came from 52 U.S. mayors. Last
year, the contest received only 215 nominations.

PAYLESS CASHWAYS PLANS SCALED-DOWN ANNUAL MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Payless Cashways Inc. on Wednesday will hold
its third annual meeting since the ``new'' Payless Cashways was
formed in 1997 after the retailer emerged from Chapter 11
bankruptcy reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   Today's meeting is expected to be subdued. In a letter to
shareholders in the company's proxy statement, Chief Executive
Officer Millard Barron warns as much:
</P>
<P>
   ``Please be advised that this year's format will be
substantially different from our past meetings. ... This year we
will meet at our store support center offices, eliminate all
management presentations, and conduct only the formal business
required.''
</P>
<P>
   The only formal business slated for the meeting is the
re-election of three outside directors: Peter G. Danis, who is the
nonexecutive chairman of Payless; David G. Gundling; and Donald E.
Roller.
</P>
<P>
   Barron added that if any shareholder attending had questions,
company officials would be available to answer them.
</P>
<P>
   If it comes off as intended, the meeting will be a marked
turnaround from last year's gathering. That meeting was held in a
hotel ballroom filled with product displays, legions of company
employees and curious shareholders, all eager to meet the new
management.
</P>
<P>
   In another letter to shareholders, this one in the 1999 annual
report, Barron said 1998 was the year the company ``stopped the
slide'' and 1999 was the year it slowly started to turn the ship
around.
</P>
<P>
   And although Payless lost 41 cents a share last year, that was a
63 percent improvement over the $1.12 a share lost in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although we will never be satisfied with a loss, our financial
results for 1999 show substantial improvement,'' Barron wrote.
``With the slide stopped and the turnaround effort well under way,
it is important that our team stays focused on the goals of
consistent profitability and renewed growth.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's shareholders, numbering almost 5,000, hope to see
those goals realized. They have watched the company's stock price
stagnate in the mid- to high $2 range for months. Payless' stock is
traded on the bulletin board system of Nasdaq under the ticker
symbol PCSH. In late 1997, the new stock traded in the high $5
range.
</P>
<P>
   As he has preached since coming on board, Barron says Payless'
mission is to become the supplier of choice for the professional
builder and contractor, as well as the serious do-it-yourself
consumer.
</P>
<P>
   Barron pointed to progress on that front. Though same-store
sales were down 0.8 percent last year, he said, same-store sales to
the target customer segments were up 7.3 percent from the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In summary,'' Barron wrote, ``let me reiterate that although
we still have much to do, significant progress in reinventing our
company has been made over the course of 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   In its proxy statement, Payless reported salaries for its top
officials, ranging from $498,077 for Barron to $175,000 for James
L. Deats, vice president, information systems.
</P>
<P>
   The information on other officials showed David Krumbholz, vice
president, store operations, at $212,000; Kelly R. Abney, vice
president, logistics, replenishments and facilities, $207,000; and
Ronald D. Long, vice president, merchandising, $200,000.

JOSEPH CHRISTIAN, 84, FORMER HEAD OF NEW YORK CITY HOUSING
AUTHORITY
</HEADLINE>
  By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joseph J. Christian, chairman of the New York City Housing
Authority, the country's largest public housing authority, from
1973 to 1985, died on Thursday at his home in DeBary, Fla. He was
84 and had moved to Florida in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   At the time Christian announced his retirement as chairman, the
Housing Authority had been widely recognized as one of the
country's best-run public housing agencies.
</P>
<P>
   From 1978 through 1985, Christian, a Democrat, was the Housing
Authority's chairman under Mayor Edward I. Koch, who reappointed
him to the post, as had Mayor Abraham D. Beame, after Mayor John V.
Lindsay had originally named Christian chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New York Housing Authority was under his leadership a very
long time,'' Koch said on Tuesday. Referring to those years, Koch
added: ``It was the outstanding authority in the country. Where
other authorities had vacancies because people were afraid to live
in the housing projects operated by the government in other cities,
in New York City we had a 10-year waiting line under him. He was
known as a fine manager.''
</P>
<P>
   Judah Gribetz, a former commissioner of the city's Department of
Buildings, said on Tuesday that Christian, who rose through the
ranks of city government after beginning in 1938 as a clerk in what
was then called the Department of Housing and Buildings, ``was the
consummate career public official.''
</P>
<P>
   By the 1960s, Gribetz added, ``He probably was the most
knowledgeable person in all of the intricacies of the multiple
dwelling law and code of the state and the city'' of New York, and
``I observed the respect in which state legislators held him.''
</P>
<P>
   Christian was a member of the Civil Service generation that
started in the Depression, when private job opportunities were
limited. He held a variety of housing and administrative posts in
his 47 years of working for the city government and became known as
a believer in the value of decent housing for low-income working
families and as a dogged searcher for federal money.
</P>
<P>
   He was commissioner of development in the Housing and
Development Administration, a city agency dealing with different
housing problems, in 1973, when Lindsay chose him to lead the
Housing Authority. Christian succeeded Simeon Golar, whose
three-year tenure as head of the authority had frequently been
stormy.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in Lindsay's years as mayor, his esteem for Christian
was shown when the Mayor's Medal for Distinguished Performance was
awarded in 1969 to Christian, who was general manager of the
Housing Authority at the time. He also won the Citizens Housing and
Planning Council Public Service Award for 1978.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Woonsocket, R.I., Christian went on to be a New York
City resident. He was an artillery officer in Europe during World
War II and studied at Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute in 1951 and
the New York University Graduate School of Public Administration in
1962 and 1963.
</P>
<P>
   He married Agnes Josephine Noreyko in 1940; she died in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Christian is survived by his wife, the former Patti Rubio; a
son, Joseph J. Jr., of Winchester, Mass.; a daughter, Kathleen
Gallo, of Bayside; five grandchildren; one great-grandchild; and a
sister, Agnes Murray, of Mobile, Ala.

JOHN PAUL BLEWETT, 89, PHYSICIST AND DESIGNER OF ACCELERATORS 
</HEADLINE>
   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Paul Blewett, a nuclear physicist who played a significant
role in the development of particle accelerators, died at a
hospital in Chapel Hill, N.C., on April 7. He was 89. A Chapel Hill
resident, he had lived in Manhattan and New Suffolk, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Blewett retired in 1978 as a senior physicist at the Brookhaven
National Laboratory on Long Island, which he joined in 1947 to take
part in building its proton synchrotron. Known as the Cosmotron, it
went into operation in 1952 and was the world's most powerful
energy accelerator.
</P>
<P>
   Blewett then began the design study for the 33-billion electron
volt Alternating Gradient Synchrotron, operating since 1960. Later
he directed design studies for improving it, and toward the
development of more powerful accelerators. He was a consultant on
accelerator technology to the French Atomic Energy Commission and
CERN, the European particle physics laboratory. After retiring from
Brookhaven, he was an adviser on a synchrotron light source to the
government of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Blewett was born in Toronto. He received a degree in physics and
mathematics from the University of Toronto in 1932, and a master's
in physics in 1933. In 1936 he received a Ph.D. in physics at
Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the research laboratory of the General Electric Co. in
Schenectady, N.Y., in 1937. There he made the first direct
observation of synchrotron radiation _ the electromagnetic
radiation given off when high-energy particles are accelerated in a
strong magnetic field _ and its experimental verification in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   He was a fellow of the American Physical Society, which awarded
him its Robert R. Wilson Prize in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his wife, Joan Warnow-Blewett; two
stepdaughters, Dr. Tandy Warnow of Austin, Texas, and Dr. Kimmen
Sjolander of Lafayette, Calif.; a stepson, Paul Warnow of San
Francisco; and a sister, Constance Blewett of Toronto.

GREYHOUND'S PARENT COMPANY SUSPENDS DIVIDEND PAYMENTS 
BY TIMOTHY PRITCHARD  
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Trapped in a deepening financial hole, Laidlaw Inc.,
the Canadian company that runs Greyhound Lines and North America's
largest fleet of school buses, suspended dividend payments on its
common stock Tuesday and won some temporary relief from bankers who
are renegotiating a long-term loan agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The news contributed to a slight rally in Laidlaw's share price,
although the company is still among the worst performers in Canada
this year after having been one of the darlings of the Toronto
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Its shares, which a year ago traded at 23.40 Canadian dollars,
rose 3.6 percent here Tuesday, to close at 1.72 Canadian dollars,
or $1.16.
</P>
<P>
   The shares of Laidlaw, based in Burlington, Ontario, have been
pummeled for months by the effects of a failed growth strategy and,
more recently, by reports of improper accounting practices at an
important subsidiary, the Safety-Kleen Corp. of Columbia, S.C.
Three top executives at Safety-Kleen have been suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Burdened with $3.3 billion of debt, Laidlaw has been trying to
sell its 44 percent stake in Safety-Kleen, a waste-handling
concern. But since Safety-Kleen disclosed that an internal audit of
its accounts was under way in March, its shares have fallen more
than 30 percent, closing Tuesday at $1.0625.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the troubles at Safety-Kleen may make Laidlaw's own
financial reports for the last three years unreliable, Laidlaw has
acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian parent company has also been trying to unload a
portfolio of ambulance services and health care companies in the
United States. The division, once seen as a business that could be
profitably expanded like buses, has produced huge losses and most
of its assets remain unsold.
</P>
<P>
   Laidlaw expected to receive about $2 billion by selling
Safety-Kleen and the health care units when the disposal plan was
announced in September. Some of the money was to be used to repay
debt and some to invest in more buses.
</P>
<P>
   It now looks as if the sales will yield much less than expected,
and much later than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Laidlaw's other businesses are profitable, but analysts and
investors have speculated that a substantial write-off of its asset
base is n store.
</P>
<P>
   The financial report for the second quarter, which ended on Feb.
29, was to have been released in mid-April. The company said last
week that the report would not be ready until the end of the month,
and added Tuesday that the new arrangement with its bankers assured
that release date.
</P>
<P>
   The banks have waived protection on an existing $1.5 billion
credit, of which $1.2 billion has been drawn. But further advances
under the current agreement will be limited to $30 million. A May
31 target date has been set for a new lending pact.
</P>
<P>
   Canceling its dividend payments, a related agreement, will save
Laidlaw $62 million a year.

SHERWOOD WASHBURN, PIONEER IN PRIMATE STUDIES, DIES AT 88 
</HEADLINE>
   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Sherwood Larned Washburn, an anthropologist and pioneering
primatologist who linked the evolution of human behavior traits to
the actions of apes and monkeys, died on Sunday at a hospital near
his home in Berkeley, Calif. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn was an emeritus professor of anthropology at the
University of California at Berkeley, where he taught and worked
from 1958 to 1978. He helped the university become a leader in
primatology during his tenure with his study of baboon colonies in
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   His work also took him to remote areas of Sri Lanka, Thailand,
Borneo and South Africa, where he made friends with the famous
fossil-hunting Leakey family. On campus, Washburn's lectures
inspired standing ovations from his students.
</P>
<P>
   In his research, Washburn took a holistic approach, proceeding
from anatomy to function and behavior.
</P>
<P>
   In the classroom and on the printed page, he explained how
bones, joints and muscles were related to movement and social
behavior in humans and other primates. He wrote many articles, and
his books included ``Human Evolution: Biosocial Perspectives'' and
``Ape Into Human: A Study of Human Evolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherwood Washburn, known as Sherry, was born in Cambridge, Mass.
He graduated from Groton School in 1931 and, summa cum laude, from
Harvard in 1935. He received his doctorate in anthropology from
Harvard in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   He started his academic career as an instructor at Columbia
University in 1939 and soon after became an assistant professor of
anatomy. From 1947 until his appointment at Berkeley he was based
at the University of Chicago. At Berkeley he was given the rare
title of university professor in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   He won nearly every medal and prize given in his field,
including the Wenner-Gren Foundation's Viking Medal in 1960, the
Huxley Medal in 1967 and the Distinguished Service Award of the
American Anthropological Association in 1983. The Fourth
International Congress of Primatology in 1972 was dedicated to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sherry Washburn was one of the great pioneers of the modern
life sciences,'' said Dr. David A. Hamburg, president emeritus of
the Carnegie Foundation. ``He brought together an unprecedented
variety of disciplines to provide insight into the evolutionary
origins of human anatomy and behavior. He opened up the study of
primate behavior in natural habitats.''
</P>
<P>
   Washburn is survived by two sons, Sherwood, of Brooklyn, N.Y.,
and Stan, of Berkeley; a brother, Dr. Bradford Washburn, of
Lexington, Mass.; and six grandchildren. His wife, Henrietta Pease
Washburn, died in 1985 after 47 years of marriage.
