IN FINAL DRESS REHEARSAL, GIANTS LOSE TO RAVENS, 14-6 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ So this was the Giants' final tuneup
before the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' defense, especially the first-string unit which
played only the first quarter of the game, dominated.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' offense, especially the first-string unit, moved
awkwardly when it moved at all. Although, to be fair, it was
obvious coach Jim Fassel was holding his offense back, reluctant to
display any new schemes or plays with the regular season now just a
week away.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Baltimore Ravens were ever-so-slightly less
listless than the Giants, who stumbled to defeat, 14-6.
</P>
<P>
   It was a game almost entirely devoid of highlights, and here is
proof: In a scoreless first half, the crowd, which was announced as
48,754, was most amused by a gray squirrel that wandered onto the
playing field. The crowd cheered as the squirrel eluded a
maintenance worker with a net and other security officers. The
biggest cheer of the first half may have been when the squirrel ran
the length of the field and crossed the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   The loss means the Giants conclude the preseason with a 1-3
record for the second consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants offensive starters were on the field for three
possessions in a little more than a quarter of play, but ran only
10 plays and picked up only one first down.
</P>
<P>
   Starting running back Tiki Barber rushed for 7 yards on five
carries while quarterback Danny Kanell completed two of five passes
for 22 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The intent of this final preseason game _ and there were not
many significant goals other than avoiding injury _ was to give the
Giants' starters a last warmup for the regular season, which begins
Sept. 6 with a pivotal home game against the Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   But the Giants' starting offense won't be using Friday night's
performance as a momentum builder. Playing without fullback Charles
Way, who sat out the game to rest a mildly sprained ankle, the
Giants' offense was never in sync.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On the Giants' first series, Barber was stopped at the line of
scrimmage in consecutive carries. On third down, Barber caught a
6-yard pass from Kanell. On the next Giants possession, Barber
gained 9 yards on two rushing attempts, but on third-and-1, Barber
lost a yard.
</P>
<P>
   On the final Giants possession involving the team's starters,
Kanell connected with Chris Calloway for a 16-yard first-down pass.
Then it was back to the familiar pattern of this game for the
Giants offense: Barber lost a yard. Kanell overthrew Ike Hilliard
twice.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively in the first quarter, the Giants' starting defense
was making the Ravens' starting offense look like the Giants'
starting offense.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore's lone significant foray into Giants territory in the
first half followed a pass-interference penalty on the Giants' new
cornerback, Conrad Hamilton. Hamilton was making his first start in
place of Jason Sehorn, who injured knee ligaments in the
Giants-Jets preseason game Aug. 20.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the Ravens did not seem to be targeting Hamilton.
Baltimore's starting quarterback, Jim Harbaugh, completed five of
six passes for 33 yards. The Giants' first-string defense, as it
was a year ago, was especially tough against the run, limiting the
Ravens runners to 26 first-half yards on 15 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, the Giants' reserves, led by the backup
quarterback Kent Graham, mounted two drives that produced two Bard
Daluiso field goals.
</P>
<P>
   A 19-yard completion from Graham to tight end Andy Haase and a
16-yard run by Tyrone Wheatley led to a 46-yard Daluiso field goal.
Later in the third quarter, Amani Toomer caught a third-down pass
from Graham for 10 yards and a first down. Graham finished the game
with 131 yards passing, connecting on 11 of 19 passes.
</P>
<P>
   On the next play, the rookie wide receiver Joe Jurevicius ran a
down-and-out that he then turned up the sideline, leaving the
Baltimore cornerback Duane Starks in his wake. Graham's throw to
Jurevicius was well-timed, the play becoming a 59-yard gain that
brought the Giants to the Ravens' 4-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   But the Giants could advance the football just one yard in three
downs, setting up a 22-yard Daluiso field goal and giving the
Giants a 6-0 lead with 5:34 left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   That lead was short-lived. Six plays and 81 yards later, the
Ravens had taken the lead. Baltimore backup quarterback Eric Zeier
victimized the second-string Giants secondary with a number of
short and long passes.
</P>
<P>
   On a second-and-8 from the Giants' 23-yard line, Baltimore
halfback Errict Rhett broke over right tackle, dashing into the
Giants end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore defensive end Mike Frederick sacked Graham on the
Giants' 14-yard line midway through the fourth quarter, causing a
fumble that Frederick also recovered. But Giants safety Percy
Ellsworth intercepted a pass by the Ravens quarterback Wally
Richardson in the Giants' end zone. It was Ellsworth's second
interception of the game and his third of the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants had two injuries in the game. Safety and special
teams player Brandon Sanders sprained his ankle and foot, and
Jurevicius injured his big toe on his right foot.

JETS GO ON THE OFFENSIVE AND THWART THE BEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The Jets closed their preseason Friday night with an
opening burst of offense so varied and potent that it simply
stunned the Chicago Bears into inaction until the second half, when
the backups for both sides came in.
</P>
<P>
   The way the Jets' first-stringers performed in winning their
third of four exhibition games, this one by a score of 24-7, should
make them feel better about opening their regular season in San
Francisco on Sept. 6. The victory also swelled coach Bill Parcells'
career exhibition record to 42-15, including 7-1 with the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   With their streaky offense that simply was too much for the
Bears on virtually every play, the Jets charged to a 10-0
first-quarter lead.
</P>
<P>
   But more important to the Jets' long-range hopes was the variety
and depth of that offense. It included eight straight completions
by Glenn Foley for 129 yards and a 5-yard rushing average by Curtis
Martin, whose nine carries amassed 45 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Wayne Chrebet caught four passes for 86 yards,
including one for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets may also have been showing some things to come, such as
tight end Kyle Brady slinking in the slot. Most impressive for
sustained power was the team's opening drive. It consumed 9 minutes
28 seconds and churned out 75 yards before Brett Conway kicked a
25-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   That was quickly followed by an 86-yard march on which Foley hit
Chrebet for a 22-yard touchdown. Over all, the Jets had possession
for 12:32 of the opening period.
</P>
<P>
   It was a quarter in which the Bears netted 1 yard of offense.
Quarterback Erik Kramer sprained a toe and was replaced by Steve
Stenstrom. But while Stenstrom found receivers for 10 completions
in 14 attempts, the Jets halted his runners. Nine carries by the
Bears generated only 23 yards in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, this was not the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears had come in with an 0-3 preseason mark. Still, as
Parcells continued to tinker, what the Jets did was impressive.
</P>
<P>
   So nine days before his team's season opener, Parcells moved
around players at four spots: right cornerback, where the big play
maker but also vulnerable Otis Smith was replaced by Marcus
Coleman; free safety, where Kevin Williams, the third-round rookie,
suddenly was placed ahead of Raymond Austin; left guard, where
Lamont Burns replaced Todd Burger; and place-kicker, where Conway
took over for John Hall.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a duel for backup running back between Richie
Anderson and Robert Farmer. It could come down to the admonition
that Parcells throws at his players on the first day of training
camp every year. ``What can you do to make me take you to the
game?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, for players who may not be starters, what other
skills do you possess? And for Farmer, that extra dimension is his
ability to play well on special teams. So even though Anderson is a
former Jets starter, and Farmer is only in his second season,
Farmer's other talent is forcing Parcells to ponder. Anderson
helped himself with a 27-yard run in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells will have until Sunday to make a decision on the final
53-man roster. He will have some thinking to do. On one play, Burns
tossed a nifty block that allowed Martin to pick up 10 yards. But
Burns also had two holding penalties.
</P>
<P>
   And while Conway's first kickoff went to the Bears' 5-yard line,
and he was successful on a 25-yard field goal, his second kickoff
bounced 40 yards downfield, and another, to open the second half,
also bounced _ but luckily for him it went into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Vinny Testaverde replaced Foley in the second half. Foley's
figures showed 12 completions in 22 attempt for 182 yards, while
Martin rested after churning out 53 yards in 11 attempts.

PINT-SIZED BATTERS PUT POWER, LURE OF BASEBALL ON DISPLAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY BROOKE OLSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Even though they still hit the ball off a tee,
these pint-sized players have big league dreams.
</P>
<P>
   At the first DWP Power Hitting Competition at Hansen Dam on
Friday in the L.A. suburb of Lake View Terrace, the talk of the
dugout was of baseball's home-run derby between Mark McGwire and
Sammy Sosa, who are within strike of Roger Maris' single-season
record of 61.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played baseball for a while, but then I stopped because it
just wasn't exciting anymore,'' said Gary Garcia, 12, of Sun
Valley. ``But now, I think it'd be cool to break a record just like
McGwire is going to.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hit-to-hit competition between McGwire and Sosa,
many kids were rooting for a player in distant third _ the Seattle
Mariners Ken Griffey Jr., who trails behind with 44 home runs,
compared to Sosa's 53 and McGwire's 54.
</P>
<P>
   They say it has nothing to do with revelations that McGwire has
used a legal performance-enhancing drug. They say it is simply
because they believe Griffey is the better player and he seems more
likable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Griffey is a great player, I have all of his baseball
cards and he's just great to watch,'' said Robert Pana, 12, of Sun
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Pana was among the 1,000 baseball fanatics who turned out for
the Friday morning event in hopes that they would win the Power
Hitter prize _ a chance to hit a baseball at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Children got three swings at a baseball on a batting tee, and
hits were measured for distance and accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   For shortstop Albert Diaz, 10, of the Sun Valley All-Stars, the
competition was a chance to show off his new hitting skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been practicing hitting a lot,'' he said. ``I'm really
excited about this competition _ I can't wait to go to bat.''
</P>
<P>
   The player to hit the farthest ball in each of the three age
groups would win a trip to Dodger Stadium and the chance to compete
with other Power Hitter winners during a special True Blue event
sponsored in conjunction with the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great opportunity to get the kids excited about
baseball and to get them involved in extracurricular activities,''
said Manny Mota, the Dodgers coach who carved out his fame as a
celebrated pinch hitter for the team in the 1970s. Mota, whose
inner-city youth baseball clinic helped sponsor the event, was on
hand to sign baseballs and teach batting fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the morning, the winners were crowned.
</P>
<P>
   In the 8-and-under competition, Jake Johnson, 8, of Woodland
Hills, took first with a 130-foot hit. Oliver Padre, 10, of
Northridge, won first place in the 9-to-11 division with his
186-foot slammer. And Keith Harbour Leduc will play at Dodger
Stadium as well. The 14-year-old resident of Canyon Country, an
L.A. suburb, won for the 12- to 14-year-old division, with his hit
of 291 feet.
</P>
<P>
   While the children displayed their hitting prowess, parents and
coaches reflected on the more serious subject of McGwire's
admission he uses a performance-enhancing drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how I feel about McGwire, but I think I would
have a big problem with my kid wanting to be just like him,'' said
Patricia Armstrong of her son Sam.
</P>
<P>
   The 34-year-old resident of Woodland Hills, a suburb of Los
Angeles, along with other parents and coaches, has debated
endlessly on how to handle a sensitive topic _ the St. Louis
Cardinal player's use of androstenedione.
</P>
<P>
   Although legal, the over-the-counter adrenal hormone is a
performance enhancing drug whose long-term risks are unknown. Some
also say that McGwire's use of the drug makes the home-run derby
unfair. For that reason, parents and coaches are quietly keeping
the discussion out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Woodland Hills All-Stars Coach Brian Amenta said the issue has
yet to come up during practice with his 8-year-old players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather shield McGwire's drug use from them for now,''
Amenta said. ``I don't think steroids should be any part of
baseball _ the kids should just out there and play and have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   But for older kids who are more aware of the issue, McGwire
remains high on their list of favorite players and role models.
Several players said they do not think the use of the drug makes
the home-run competition unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it affects McGwire _ he's been a power hitter
since he played for the Oakland A's,'' said Mike Duran, 13, a
pitcher and shortstop for the Sun Valley All-Stars.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Sun Valley resident said he would never consider
using steroids. ``I don't need it,'' he said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsored by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, the
L.A. Kids Sports Academy, the Manny Mota International Foundation
and the Los Angeles Dodgers, the event featured an early morning
batting clinic in addition to the Power Hitter Competition. &QL;

DUCKS SIGN OLAUSSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 cD98 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It took nearly two months, but the Mighty Ducks finally jumped
into the free agent market on Friday when they signed defenseman
Fredrik Olausson to a two-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   A former Duck who played the past 1 1/2 seasons in Pittsburgh,
Olausson's return to Southern California should come as no
surprise. The two sides have been talking since early July and
Olausson, 31, admits the Ducks have been atop his wish list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really happy things got worked out,'' said Olausson via
phone from Sweden. ``I've got friends in the city and I do believe
Anaheim is committed to excellence...at my age that's important.''
</P>
<P>
   Some might doubt that view, but Olausson insists he believes
it's true.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know looking at Paul (Kariya) and Teemu (Selanne), they are
very competitive people,'' he explained. ``I'm convinced it's a
proud organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal were not released. Olausson made $700,000 with
the Penguins last season.
</P>
<P>
   Although the signing is hardly the blockbuster many Ducks fans
hoped for, Anaheim president and GM Pierre Gauthier said it fills a
pressing need.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brings us something we were missing, somebody who can play
on the power play,'' said Gauthier, aware that only Toronto and
Tampa Bay were worse than the Ducks with the man advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game is going toward skill and puck-moving defensemen are
more important.''
</P>
<P>
   Olausson finished the season with six goals and 33 points and a
plus-13 rating for the Penguins. The Ducks hope Olausson can at
least duplicate those type of numbers playing with Selanne and
Kariya.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some physical defensemen, some defensive
defensemen,'' said Gauthier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not sure about (offensive) skill,'' he added. ``We've
got some interesting guys (Ruslan) Salei, (Mike) Crowley, but we're
not sure what kind of impact they can have (this year).''

Every form of identification he has reads the same. Pick one, any
one: student I.D., driver's license, passport.
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is no variation. Clearly printed on each: Branndon James
Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Not one of the Texas A&AMP;M quarterback's I.D.'s has this
collection of letters: P-e-y-t-o-n M-a-n-n-i-n-g.
</P>
<P>
   None has the name Corey Pullig, Bucky Richardson or Kevin Murray
on it, either.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Stewart has been subjected to much criticism
during his career for not being any of the above and, worse yet,
not reminding people of them.
</P>
<P>
   But it appears that with his senior season on the horizon,
Stewart no longer faces charges of failing to impersonate a college
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   When the Aggies open their season against Florida State in
Monday's Kickoff Classic, Stewart will be looking simply to be the
person his I.D. indicates he is, and that should be quarterback
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already adapted enough to playing college ball that
regardless of what people write or fans say that it has no effect
on me whatsoever,'' Stewart said. ``The biggest thing for me last
year was accomplishing the goals I set for myself _ improving on my
passing percentage and cutting down on the turnovers. That was the
only thing I cared about last year, and I was able to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people want to talk about college football, and being
the quarterback, you get the finger pointed at you probably too
many times _ when you win and when you lose.''
</P>
<P>
   And as the 22-year-old has found out, you have no control over
which finger people will point.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, the Class 4A Player of the Year at Stephenville in
1993, transferred to A&AMP;M after spending his first season as one of
two highly touted freshman quarterbacks at Tennessee. The other,
Peyton Manning, went on to break nearly every career passing mark
at Tennessee and was the first selection in this year's NFL draft
by Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   After sitting out a season as a transfer, Stewart was expected
by many to match or better numbers put up by Pullig, the Aggies'
career leader in passing yards; Murray, the school's career leader
in touchdown passes; and Richardson, who ended his career seventh
in passing yards and 11th in rushing yards.
</P>
<P>
   Though Stewart's flame hasn't burned as brightly as the Aggie
Bonfire, it has been far from as dim as it looked to those who
blamed him for the team's 6-6 finish in 1996, his first year as the
Aggies' starter. That year, he completed fewer than 50 percent of
his passes and threw almost as many interceptions (seven) as
touchdown passes (nine).
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at it, he was practically a freshman,'' senior
offensive lineman Rex Tucker said. ``He had played a little at
Tennessee, then sat out a year. It was unfair to expect him to play
like a junior or senior when he got here.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as he started to struggle, which was going to happen,
everybody started to think he's not doing what he's supposed to be
doing, which I always thought was unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Stewart shared time behind center with Randy McCown
before finally having his full-time status restored just before the
eighth game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was a coincidence, but Stewart went out and completed
eight of his last nine passes to lead the Aggies to a dramatic
come-from-behind overtime victory over Oklahoma State, possibly
transforming his relationship with the A&AMP;M faithful forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in particular the Oklahoma State game showed Branndon
what he can do, I think it showed other people what he can do, and
it really elevated his status,'' A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum said.
</P>
<P>
   But with the 15-point fourth-quarter comeback against OSU
dominating everyone's thoughts, Stewart's otherwise solid season
has been somewhat overlooked. He upped his completion percentage to
.566 (111-of-196) and threw 10 touchdown passes compared to four
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always had respect for him,'' Tucker said. ``As far as
the Oklahoma State game, it didn't change anything for me.
Everything just went right for him that night. I've always thought
he was a great quarterback. Stewart makes the plays.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, maybe for the first time since he became an Aggie, that
is all that will be expected from Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Not Peyton Manning-, Corey Pullig-, Kevin Murray- or Bucky
Richardson-type plays. Just Branndon James Stewart-like plays.
</P>
<P>
   If you check his I.D., those are the plays he is most capable of
making.

Hearst Corp. after serving for 30 years as the assistant to its
syndicated columnist Louella Parsons, died Tuesday at her home in
Palm Springs, Calif. She was 95.
 &HT;    Writing under the name Dorothy Manners, she succeeded Parsons on
her retirement in 1965 and wrote a syndicated column for King
Features, the Hearst subsidiary, until her own retirement in 1977.
 &HT;    In her heyday, Miss Manners was a frequent guest on the talk
shows of Steve Allen, Joey Bishop, Dick Cavett and Mike Douglas,
and she was cited by the California Women's Press Club in 1966 as
entertainment columnist of the year.
 &HT;    Miss Manners, who was born on July 30, 1903, in Fort Worth,
Texas, moved to Hollywood with her mother after her parents'
divorce in 1919 and began a career as an actress.
 &HT;    She appeared as an extra in films with Gloria Swanson, Douglas
Fairbanks and William Powell, and performed under the direction of
Cecil B. DeMille. But by her own admission, she was an
unexceptional actress, and she decided to become a writer.
 &HT;    She began with The Hollywood Citizen and was soon hired by The
Los Angeles Times to write entertainment features. Shortly
thereafter, she joined Motion Picture magazine to write a monthly
gossip column. She became Parsons' assistant in 1935.
 &HT;    Miss Manners was married twice, first to Walter Ramsey for 10
years until their divorce and then to John Haskell for 30 years
until his death in 1977.
 &HT;    No immediate family members survive.

   John Williams, 88, Former Arizona Governor
</P>
<P>
   John R. Williams, who was governor of Arizona from 1967 to 1975
and helped the Republican Party gain a solid foothold in the state,
died Monday at his home in Phoenix. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was the first Arizona governor to serve a four-year
term, as a result of a constitutional amendment that state voters
approved in 1968. He had previously served two two-year terms.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Los Angeles, Williams knew poverty and illness in his
youth. But he managed to graduate from Phoenix Junior College in
1929 and to get a job as a radio broadcaster, which made him a
familiar figure statewide. He eventually came to own the station.
</P>
<P>
   Entering politics, he served as a school board member and
Phoenix city councilman before being elected mayor in 1956 for the
first of two terms. With Williams' election as governor in 1966,
the Republicans gained their first clear mandate in Arizona history
as they also took control of both houses of the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' wife, Vera May Williams, died last December after 55
years of marriage. He is survived by his sons, Michael and John
Jr.; a daughter, Nikki Newcome, and five grandchildren.

   Harold Siegel, 80, Who Aided School Board
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Harold Siegel, a former secretary and counsel to the
New York City Board of Education, died Tuesday at his home in
Manhattan. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from a stroke, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel joined the professional staff of the school board in 1951
as a confidential secretary, and left a year later to serve as
executive director of the United Parents Associations of New York
City for 13 years. He returned in 1965 as executive assistant and
was promoted to secretary the following year.
</P>
<P>
   The board, which regarded him as the layman with the most
intimate knowledge of the educational system, combined two
positions in 1977 to create the post of secretary/counsel and named
Siegel to it.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Manhattan, Siegel graduated from City College in
1931 and earned a law degree at Brooklyn Law School in 1934. He
received a master's degree in education at New York University in
1947.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 60 years, the former Miriam
Gzibeck; two daughters, Toni, of Manhattan, and Martha, of New
City; two sisters, Bea McNanie of Garden City and Harriet Moss of
Manhattan, and three grandchildren.

EDITORIAL: FAIRER ELECTIONS IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Aug. 29:
</P>
<P>
   Congress and the New York state Legislature may balk at
revamping their cash-saturated systems for financing elections, but
the New York City Council voted changes this week that should make
elections in the city among the fairest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   By a veto-proof vote of 42-5, the Council approved Speaker Peter
Vallone's reform package that would lower contribution limits and
increase matching funds for the voluntary campaign finance system
in time for the 2001 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, the vote came at just the right time. Term limits
mean that many of the Council members who voted for the new system
will no longer be around to abide by it. This seems to have worked
to the voters' advantage. In addition, Vallone, a candidate for the
Democratic gubernatorial nomination, can now boast that he helped
create an equitable financing system and would try to do the same
for the state.
</P>
<P>
   The Council bill lowers contribution limits to $4,500 per donor,
compared with the $45,000 allowed in state elections. Candidates
who opt into the city system also would receive vastly improved
matching funds, at a ratio of 4 to 1 for gifts under $250, if they
do not take corporate contributions. The package was supported by
various public interest groups and the city's Campaign Finance
Board.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has remained cautious in his criticism of
the Vallone package, but his suggestion that taxpayers would object
to increased matching funds seems at odds with his own experience.
The mayor has received a total of $4.1 million in such funds in his
last three mayoral bids.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating this reform is a side argument between Vallone and
Giuliani over Yankee Stadium. Vallone has tried to get a referendum
on the November ballot banning city funds to move Yankee Stadium to
Manhattan. Giuliani countered by setting up a Charter Revision
Commission that came up with its own referendum item on campaign
financing.
</P>
<P>
   Since a charter referendum automatically bumps a Council
referendum from the ballot, Vallone's Yankee Stadium item
disappears. That leaves us with a referendum on campaign financing
that could undercut the Council's reforms.
</P>
<P>
   These reforms should be left alone. At a time when money buys
too many candidates, they offer a level playing field for
politicians heavy on drive and talent but light on cash.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Aug. 29:
</P>
<P>
   The Senate will not have much time to approve legislation on
patients' rights when it returns next week from its August recess.
Its chances of enacting something worthwhile will be slim if
Republicans and Democrats insist on turning the stalemate into a
campaign issue with which to hammer each other. The blame strategy,
however, could backfire with voters who want protection from unfair
health insurance practices.
</P>
<P>
   The House has already passed a bill that would guarantee
emergency care coverage, allow consumers to appeal denials of
coverage to an independent panel and permit women direct access to
gynecologists and obstetricians, all of which the Democrats want.
But President Clinton is likely to veto this plan because it
expands medical savings accounts, a provision strongly opposed by
the Democrats, and it does not change existing law that bars
consumers from suing federally regulated health plans for damages
related to the denial of benefits. The Senate Republican bill,
sponsored by Don Nickles of Oklahoma, is unacceptable because it
would apply only to the 48 million individuals covered by plans in
which large employers act as their own insurers.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Democratic plan offers broader protections and would
apply to an estimated 150 million privately insured individuals. It
would also allow people to sue for damages when benefits are
denied. But the Republicans look on any open-ended right to sue as
a poison pill that will drive up insurance costs.
</P>
<P>
   There is a workable, bipartisan compromise bill that could end
this political standoff. Sponsored by Sens. John Chafee, Joseph
Lieberman, Bob Graham, Arlen Specter and Max Baucus, the plan
adopts nearly all the protections favored by the Democrats and does
not expand medical savings accounts. In benefit denial cases, it
would allow suits in federal court for recovery of economic damages
and attorneys' fees only. While this would not allow compensation
for pain and suffering or punitive damages, it is a step in the
right direction and substantially better than the current law,
which allows practically no recovery at all.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also contains an important enforcement provision
that no other bill offers. It authorizes the departments of Labor
and Health and Human Services to levy fines upwards of $250,000
against health plans that fail to comply with the requirements of
the bill. That would include failure to provide benefits specified
in the bill, as well as failure to meet disclosure and other
obligations. This plan deserves the White House's support.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Aug. 29:
</P>
<P>
   Panamanians go to the polls Sunday to decide whether their
president, Ernesto Perez Balladares, can amend the constitution to
run for a second term. Perez Balladares' bid to stay in power is
part of a trend among Latin American presidents, virtually all of
whom are barred from running for two consecutive terms. If he is
successful, he would be the fourth president to win a
constitutional amendment for re-election in the past few years, and
several others have contemplated trying. The trend is dangerous for
fragile Latin democracies, contributing to the personalist rule
that has plagued the continent.
</P>
<P>
   Perez Balladares' move is a gamble, as polls show that
Panamanians reject his re-election by a margin of more than 20
percentage points. One reason is that many are uncomfortable with
his already substantial power. His party dominates the legislature
and the supreme court.
</P>
<P>
   The Panama Canal, along with its surrounding properties and U.S.
military bases, reverts to Panamanian control on the last day of
1999. Perez Balladares will be able to manage that process only if
he is re-elected. But many Panamanians worry that he would try to
take the spoils for members of his party. The Panama Canal
Authority he nominated last year to run the canal after 2000 is
full of his cronies. Bids to privatize parts of the canal that have
already been turned over to Panama have not been truly open and
competitive, according to the U.S. trade representative.
</P>
<P>
   Voters elsewhere in Latin America are also rebelling against
re-election bids by presidents who control their judiciaries and
other political institutions. Carlos Menem of Argentina and Alberto
Fujimori of Peru both changed their constitutions to permit second
terms. Menem took a public shelling when he announced he would try
for another amendment permitting a third term, and in July he
dropped the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   In Peru, Fujimori is using an outrageous series of maneuvers to
get a third term. In 1996 he announced he would run again in 2000.
When the constitutional court blocked him, the Congress, which he
controls, sacked three justices. A citizens' group began collecting
signatures for a referendum to block him. It has collected the
remarkable number of 1.4 million, enough to force a referendum.
</P>
<P>
   This week, however, the Fujimori-controlled National Election
Board reversed an earlier decision and ruled that the referendum
required the approval of Congress. To no one's surprise, Congress
on Thursday killed the referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Cold War is over, there are no patrons for outright
dictators in Latin America. Fujimori is the worst of the region's
new kind of autocrats, who keep a veneer of legality but plunder
their country's institutions to expand their powers.

NO MORE MONKEY BUSINESSFOR CURIOUS CHIMP AT ZOO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY PETER HARTLAUB  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For those keeping score at home, it's now Gracie
the chimp 3, zoo architects 0.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Zoo's most rambunctious simian busted out again
earlier this month, proving once again that Steve McQueen and
Charles Bronson aren't the only primates that can plan a great
escape.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the Chimpanzees of Mahale Mountain habitat opened
Aug. 1, Gracie staged her third breakout in the past five years,
leading zoo officials to announce Friday that they are closing the
exhibit Sept. 9-21.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that if any chimpanzee would find a way to escape, it
would be Gracie,'' said chimpanzee keeper Vicki Bingaman. ``She's
very smart and is a great escape artist.''
</P>
<P>
   The zoo will let the humans who designed the exhibit find a way
to fix the flaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever a new exhibit opens, the animals challenge the human
designers,'' said zoo Director Manuel Mollinedo in a statement.
``We expected that something like this could happen, so our
contract requires the builder to alter the design to prevent
escapes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gracie, the most mischievous of 13 Mahale Mountain chimps, used
her immense strength to climb up a rock wall in the back of the
exhibit. Gracie broke out the day after the $5 million habitat
opened, although officials said she stayed near her home and didn't
do any exploring at the 113-acre zoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``All she did was climb straight to the top,'' spokeswoman Gilda
Franklin said. ``She made a lot of noise to let everyone know she
was really proud of herself.''
</P>
<P>
   A temporary repair has been made _ an electric fence, which the
11-year-old Gracie touched once then decided to leave alone, said
Franklin. Zoo managers will close the exhibit to the public while
permanent changes are made.
</P>
<P>
   Gracie first tested _ and defeated _ the confines of Mahale
Mountain in December, before the outdoor portion of the exhibit was
complete. A zoo keeper returned from lunch to find a younger chimp
munching on a light bulb and several others running around a
humans-only facility after they managed to open a guillotine-style
door.
</P>
<P>
   Gracie, whose nickname is Wild One, is believed to be the
ringleader of that escape.
</P>
<P>
   The incident prompted inspectors from the U.S. Department of
Agriculture to visit the new facility and order several small
repairs, although the bulk of their report praised the dramatic
improvements over the old concrete habitat.
</P>
<P>
   A zoo keeper's log from the December escape said Gracie threw an
exit sign at a veterinarian, which is her modus operandi, according
to zoo literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gracie throws things at visitors to mark her territory,'' her
biography reads. Another brochure says ``she is smart and
constantly getting into mischief.''
</P>
<P>
   Gracie and two older Curious Georges broke out of their old home
in 1993 _ with the help of a zoo guest. They scaled their moat on a
rope tossed in their old exhibit and were running around the park
for almost 45 minutes. &QL;

CATERER SETTLES SUIT OVER EXCLUSION OF FEMALE WAITERS FROM SOME
EVENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One of New York City's best-known caterers has agreed
to pay $425,000 to settle a class-action sex discrimination lawsuit
brought by waitresses who said they were denied the opportunity to
work at lucrative private parties.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement reached by the caterer, Glorious Food, stems from
a suit filed in 1995 by the Women's Rights Project of the American
Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   The suit charged that Glorious Food placed a ceiling on the
number of female waiters at parties and excluded them from working
at small private parties, in part because the company felt that its
corporate appearance was enhanced when its haute cuisine was served
by men.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the agreement, Glorious Food said that it would no
longer suggest or accommodate client requests for men-only staffing
at events and parties and that it would not discriminate against
women in salaries, job assignments or benefits.
</P>
<P>
   A Civil Liberties Union official called the settlement terms
``highly unusual'' in today's political climate, which she said is
hostile to affirmative action remedies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually every change we were prepared to ask for in court,
we got in this settlement,'' said the official, Sara Mandelbaum,
lead counsel for the Women's Rights Project. ``This is a victory
for all women workers and a warning to all employers that sex
discrimination does not pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Sean Driscoll, the president and co-owner of Glorious Food, in
Manhattan, said, ``We are thrilled that this matter is behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically the terms and conditions of compliance were agreed
upon in 1996 and this brings to a close the financial aspects of
the agreement,'' he added. ``While any inequities that might have
taken place within our employment practices were on our part purely
inadvertent or coincidental, we nonetheless accept the agreement
and are delighted to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   The $425,000 payment, minus court costs and lawyers' fees of
about $100,000, will be made over three years to about 400 women
who worked at the company from June 21, 1993, to June 30 of this
year. The amount each will receive will depend on variables like
length of employment.
</P>
<P>
   With 500 part-time workers and an estimated annual gross income
of $10 million, Glorious Food is possibly the city's largest and
most prestigious catering business, with clients including Fortune
500 companies and fashion designers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The lawsuit was brought on behalf of Jessica Weigmann, a
waitress who charged that the company discriminated against her and
other female employees because of their sex. In 1996, the suit was
amended as a class action. Five additional named plaintiffs also
joined the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mandelbaum said the ACLU was prepared to present documents
from a witness showing that Glorious Food account executives
indicated ``all men'' and ``male only'' for certain parties,
including a 1993 pediatric AIDS benefit held by Vogue magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Because women were virtually banned from working at these
parties, which hold the most potential for tips, female waiters
received significantly less pay than their male counterparts, said
Ms. Weigmann, who no longer works in catering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glorious Food not only hurt me by diminishing my earning
power,'' she said. ``They also sent a message to the wealthy and
powerful that it's OK to treat women as second-class citizens. In
this society, the notion of equal rights is meaningless without
equal earning power.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mandelbaum noted that the Women's Rights Project brought a
successful class action lawsuit in 1977 against the ``21'' Club, La
Cote Basque, the Four Seasons and five other restaurants, all of
which had refused to hire women as waiters.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mandelbaum added: ``Whether the job is frying burgers at
McDonald's or serving hors d'oeuvres at a black-tie benefit,
federal and state employment laws require employers to follow a
policy of nondiscrimination for both female and male workers.''

N.Y. CITY COUNCIL SUES GIULIANI OVER BALLOT PROPOSAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The feud between the city's top two officials
worsened Friday when Council Speaker Peter Vallone charged in a
lawsuit that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani had interfered with the city's
legislative process by creating a charter commission solely to
block a Council-sponsored referendum on the future of Yankee
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone, joined by the Council's Black and Latino Caucus, also
asked the Department of Justice to investigate whether the
formation of the Charter Revision Commission last spring violated
the federal Voting Rights Act. They say that voter turnout,
particularly among members of minority groups, could be reduced
because any proposal the commission were to place on the ballot in
November would knock off the ``popular'' Yankee Stadium referendum.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing on the lawsuit is scheduled for Sept. 25 before
Justice Douglas McKeon of state Supreme Court in the Bronx. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vallone said that the lawsuit sought to block any charter
proposal from appearing on the ballot so that his referendum item _
which asks whether city money should be used to build a stadium for
the New York Yankees in Manhattan _ can be put to the public. He
said of the mayor and his creation of the charter panel: ``He's
doing it purposely to stop the referendum. It's mind-boggling.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Vallone contend that he, too, is playing politics
with the issue, given that he is a Democratic candidate for
governor who could benefit from a larger turnout in the Bronx, the
home of Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   City Corporation Counsel Michael Hess, who responded on behalf
of the Giuliani administration, said, ``I think it's a political
game they're playing with the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether cravenly political or purely philosophical, the game
being played by Giuliani and Vallone has, at the very least, been
exhausting. It has lasted several months, disrupted the city's
budget process despite a $2 billion surplus, and developed enough
subplots to engage a political-science graduate class for a
semester.
</P>
<P>
   It began earlier this year when Giuliani suggested that the city
might offer the West Side of Manhattan as a possible stadium site
for the Yankees, whose owners are both dissatisfied with their
Bronx stadium and mildly interested in moving to New Jersey. Seeing
this proposal as detrimental to the Bronx, Vallone announced his
plan for a referendum on the mayor's idea.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said he perceived the referendum as a bad approach to
government and as a bid by Vallone to improve his chances in the
governor's race. He countered by creating the commission, whose
ballot proposals, by law, prevent any referendum from being
presented to the voters.
</P>
<P>
   Several attempts at settling the feud between the Republican
mayor and the Democratic speaker, who had previously enjoyed a
cordial relationship, failed. The Council wound up passing a budget
in defiance of the mayor, who responded by cutting some Council
spending plans from the budget.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the mayor appointed various colleagues and political
supporters to the charter commission, which embarked on an
ambitious agenda. But as it traveled to each of the five boroughs
to hold public hearings, the commission frequently found its
credibility damaged by the politically charged atmosphere in which
it was created.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, this month, the commission settled on one item for the
November ballot: a proposal to prohibit candidates from accepting
contributions from corporations.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday the Council passed a much more ambitious
campaign-finance package, raising the possibility of conflict if
both the Council's legislation and the charter commission's
proposal are adopted. At the same time, the Council sent Giuliani
another message by voting overwhelmingly to override his veto of
its stadium referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the Council brought this complex dispute to the court.
In its lawsuit contending that the mayor unconstitutionally
encroached on the Council's legislative powers, it pointed out that
the mayor had announced that he was creating the charter commission
to block the Council referendum. In a press release announcing the
lawsuit, the Council dismissed the charter commission as ``a
sham.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hess scoffed at the Council's presentation of its case as
honorable and free of political taint. He noted that the Council
had filed its lawsuit in the Bronx, instead of in Manhattan where
the Council and the mayor have their offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess somehow they thought they'd get a better deal in the
Bronx,'' Hess said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Weinberg, the Council's lawyer, answered, ``Since this
is a dispute about Yankee Stadium and what the mayor wants to do
with that real estate, it's perfectly appropriate to have the
lawsuit filed in the Bronx.''

MONDESI'S FOIBLES FORCE CHANGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Raul Mondesi hit two home runs Aug. 2 to defeat the New
York Mets at Shea Stadium, many thought he finally had inherited
Mike Piazza's team.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of taking off, though, Mondesi's season tailed off.
Although his 21 homers and 82 RBI have him on pace for a career
year, he has been dropped from third to fifth in the order.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi is batting .288, but his average with runners in scoring
position has dropped to .218 (29 for 133) with six homers and 39
RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason is the return of muscle soreness in his lower
back.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the two-homer game against New York, Mondesi
missed two games with back pain. He returned to the lineup but now
says the problem is back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has showed up again in the last couple of days,'' Mondesi
said. ``This is not the time of year to sit out, but it is a
problem again.''
</P>
<P>
   Another part of the problem is his impatience at the plate.
Between June 30 and Aug. 11, Mondesi did not draw a base on balls.
He has walked three times since.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see a lot of good pitches when the other teams know
you aren't being selective,'' third base coach Joey Amalfitano.
``His talent is incredible, but he has to become more patient to be
all he can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Glenn Hoffman dropped Mondesi in the order and
the Dodgers responded with the first four-game winning streak of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman moved cleanup hitter Gary Sheffield to third and put
Eric Karros in the fourth spot.
</P>
<P>
   In the three-game series against Montreal, Mondesi went 2 for 12
with no extra-base hits.
</P>
<P>
   GM search update: Orioles assistant Kevin Malone interviewed
Friday for the Dodgers' general manager's spot. Malone, 41, has
been an assistant to Baltimore GM Pat Gillick since December 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Like Florida's Dave Dombrowski and Gary Hughes, Malone is a
product of the Montreal Expos office. Drafted as a second baseman
by Cleveland in 1980, he began as a scout with the Angels in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   If Malone does not get the Dodgers job, he might wind up the GM
in Baltimore. Gillick is in the final year of his contract and is
expected to retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really want to comment on the process,'' Malone said
after meeting with club president Bob Graziano. ``I'm just glad to
be considered. It's a great opportunity. They've got a great
tradition. I'm glad I'm in the running. It would be great if I was
fortunate enough and blessed to be the one selected to take this
organization forward.''

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Mark Richt, having returned to Florida State
after one season as East Carolina's offensive coordinator,
naturally wanted to see the hand he was dealt.
<TEXT>
<P>
   This was before Florida State would be a national champion, when
the Seminoles were on the brink of everything they would become in
the '90s. They were only three seasons into their 11-year run of
never finishing a season with fewer than 10 wins, never ending a
year out of the top four. Richt was given the quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   It took only a few days before Richt knew there was something
special about this group. And long before they would carve their
share of college football history, he would put them together for a
group photograph, as if to record the moment just to be sure he was
seeing what he thought.
</P>
<P>
   Richt still sees that photograph, on the wall that faces his
desk, every day. But for years, he did not marvel at his collection
of talent on the back row _ Casey Weldon, Brad Johnson and Charlie
Ward _ and their assorted NFL successes and college championships,
not to mention Ward's 1993 Heisman Trophy. He did not even wonder
about Kenny Felder, the fourth member of that second row who left
as a first-round pick of the Milwaukee Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   Richt instead saw the towering, shaggy-haired freshman kneeling
between two walk-ons and wondered what kind of player he could have
been.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first few years, I thought maybe he'd come back,''
Richt said. ``By the third year, I sort of gave up. After the third
season, I didn't think he'd ever be back.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight years after the photo was taken, five years after Richt
gave up hope of ever seeing that prodigy on a football field, Chris
Weinke is Florida State's starting quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   He no longer seems as lanky, and the hair, thinning now, is as
carefully combed as a banker's.
</P>
<P>
   But eight seasons ago, when Weinke left Florida State after four
days to play minor-league baseball in the Toronto Blue Jays'
system, Seminoles coach Bobby Bowden said there would always be a
scholarship waiting for him. Before the 1997 season, and well after
Bowden had presumed the nation's top high school prospect of 1989
long gone, Weinke took him up on the offer.
</P>
<P>
   And when Dan Kendra announced last spring that he would need
another season to rehabilitate his torn right knee, Weinke had
become a starting quarterback with 13 career attempts but all sorts
of mileage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bet every coach would love his quarterback to be 26,'' said
Bowden, who prior to Monday's Kickoff Classic against Texas A&AMP;M has
started just three sophomore quarterbacks in 23 seasons. ``He's
coming in with the hunger of a sophomore yet the maturity of a
professional. He's been hanging around professionals for six years.
It's the way he acts, yet, thank goodness, he has not lost one bit
of his humility. It's almost too good to be true.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no escaping the difference between Weinke and his
teammates. He has a bearing that could come only with time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very much in control, very confident,'' Richt said.
``(Tuesday) was just a rough practice all the way around. He wasn't
throwing the ball as well as normal. I was riding him. He took the
coaching very well. But afterward, he came to me and said,
`Everything's going to be OK.' He was being fairly sarcastic, but
he said, `Tomorrow, the sun will come up. We'll practice again. And
everything will be all right.' If that had been a true sophomore,
he would have been cowering.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinke's teammates accept the differences. Even the kidding that
seemed clever last season has lost its appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he first got here, we used to get on him,'' said
offensive lineman Ross Brannon, Weinke's roommate. ``We used to
make fun of his hair loss, call him Paul Blake (the thirtysomething
quarterback in the movie Necessary Roughness).''
</P>
<P>
   But Weinke at least had a few good minor-league baseball stories
to share and some cash left from the $375,000 signing bonus that
lured him from Florida State in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   He could tell of the time he was at first base when a Birmingham
Barons rookie named Michael Jordan got his first minor-league hit,
called him Weink-dog and told him to keep the ball in case he never
got another hit. He could drop the names of major-leaguers he
played with or against in the minors.
</P>
<P>
   He could tell about the time when playing in Knoxville, Tenn.,
that Peyton Manning advised that if Weinke ever got the chance to
play college football to grab it, advice he himself followed when
he postponed his NFL career to play his senior season at Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said there's nothing better,'' Weinke said. ``He wasn't
lying.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Weinke's development and the growth of a similarly
talented-but-untested offensive line could be the difference
between another top-five finish and a national championship. Weinke
is unfazed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm in the huddle, I take over,'' he said. ``I demand
respect. I'm not saying I'm better than anyone. But I'm a leader,
and they like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinke's choice now seems so obvious. At 6-5 and 225 pounds, he
has all the skills he could ever want to play quarterback. And he
loved his four days in the summer of 1990. ``Being back,'' he said,
``brought back all the old memories.''
</P>
<P>
   But he chose baseball with no intention of returning to
Tallahassee. And for most of his six years in the minors, he
steadily worked his way through Toronto's system. In 1993, he hit
.285 with 18 homers and 98 RBIs for Class AA Knoxville.
</P>
<P>
   But in the next few years, his career seemed to stall at the
Class AAA level. When he was asked to try a move from first base to
catcher, football seemed to be calling louder than ever. Weinke had
never lost his interest in college football, and each summer, when
his season would end and college football's would begin, he found
himself becoming an increasingly passionate Florida State fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think I'd ever go back to play college football,'' he
said. ``But my last years, I was playing Triple-A baseball with
30-year-old guys that were married and didn't have their degrees. I
didn't want that to happen with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he has found himself a college football celebrity. And
with that come demands and expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie Ward. Brad Johnson. Casey Weldon. Thad Busby. They
were all juniors before they started,'' Bowden said. ``So now we
come with a pure sophomore, and yet we've never had a sophomore
this far along. We've never had a sophomore this mature. It's not
like he's a 18-, 19-, 20-year-old guy going out there with eyes
that big looking at that crowd. This guy's been up at the plate
looking at a dadgum fastball with people booing him if he missed
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've also got a guy getting all this press that hasn't
started a game at Florida State ever, was out of it for six years,
and is playing against a football team that can beat you. He's
going to have to play good football, but I've got to be sure he
understands _ and I'll guarantee you I'll talk to him about it _
you don't have to go out and win this game for us. Just go out and
execute and do the best you can.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, all he needs now is some success. He might not have
success against Texas A&AMP;M. They might be too good defensively. That
wouldn't bother me, because he'll get it sooner or later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything else, he's got.''

NORTHWESTERN AIRLINES PILOTS OUT ON STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: This is a late add to page 1 of the New York Times.)  
(lh) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ More than 6,000 pilots at Northwest Airlines
walked off the job Friday night, shutting down the country's
fourth-largest airline in a strike that may cripple much of the
Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Despite 12 days of nearly nonstop negotiations under the
direction of a federal mediator, Northwest and the Air Line Pilots
Association could not bridge their differences and reach a
tentative contract.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who ordered striking pilots at American
Airlines back to work last year, decided not to repeat the move.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the White House said: ``The president has
decided not to exercise his authority to intervene, and he urges
the parties to stay at the table, work hard and resolve their
differences. This dispute has dragged on for almost two years now,
and both sides should redouble their efforts to reach an agreement
as soon as possible. They owe that to each other and to the
American public.''
</P>
<P>
   The strike grounded 1,700 of Northwest's daily flights and
nearly 1,000 more flown by its two commuter affiliates, Mesaba
Airlines and Express Airlines. Northwest is also one of the largest
American carriers serving Asia with 119 international flights.
</P>
<P>
   A main sticking point in the negotiations between Northwest and
the pilots, according to both sides, was the pilots' pay.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest was offering a wage increase of 10 percent over the
life of a new five-year contract, which it said would bring the
pilots in line with their counterparts at American Airlines, which
is the country's second-largest carrier.
</P>
<P>
   But the pilots, many of whom earn more than $200,000 a year,
wanted a 15 percent increase and a onetime payment of $25,000 each
to make up for the sacrifices they made in 1993, when they took a
15.5 percent pay cut, along with other Northwest union workers, to
bring Northwest back from the brink of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shared the pain to help our airline survive, and now we
want to share in the success we helped create,'' Steve Zoller, the
747 captain who is chairman of the pilots' union, said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest officials said that the pilots received 14.4 million
shares of stock, or 18 percent of the company's stock, in exchange
for their wage cuts. They say those shares are now worth more than
$500 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We acknowledge that they deserve a raise,'' said Donald J.
Foley, Northwest's vice president of communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has never been the issue,'' he said. ``The question is:
How much can the No. 4 airline afford?''
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday evening, Northwest disclosed its latest pay offer to
the union that would give pilots 4.5 percent more money than pilots
at other big airlines by the year 2000 and 7.7 percent by 2002. The
company said it would also provide profit-sharing of up to 5
percent of each pilot's pay and a lump-sum payment equal to 3.5
percent of annual pay. It also said it would make changes in its
two-tier pay scale, in which beginning pilots make 40 percent less
than experienced ones, reducing the time needed to go to the higher
tier to three years from five.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how much of an increase the latest offer was over
Northwest's initial offer of a 10 percent pay increase.

NEW JERSEY PLAYERS HAVE FLOURISHED AFTER THEIR 1975 WORLD SERIES
TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (With BBO-LITTLE-LEAGUE)  
(lh) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Reizer says he always had the confidence to speak his mind
and the ambition to set lofty goals. But it was not until he
experienced the trek and triumph of winning a Little League World
Series championship that he gained the courage to express those
qualities.
</P>
<P>
   Helping the Lakewood, N.J., All-Stars win the 1975 World Series
title affected Reizer so much that three months after the final
victory, he began writing ``Once in a Lifetime: The Story of a
National Championship Little League Team.'' When the
then-13-year-old Reizer took the finished 54-page manuscript to his
mother, she cried, hardly able to believe that her once-solitary
child, who had had trouble expressing himself, had released his
feelings on paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he came in and said, `Mom, will you read this?' tears
began running down my cheeks,'' Edwina Reizer recalled Friday.
``Everything came out in the book. He got rid of everything he had
been holding inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Reizer's book, which chronicled Lakewood's
undefeated 17-game march to the championship, was published by
Vantage Press. Proceeds from it paid for Reizer's first two years
of college and made him an unofficial expert on the Little League
World Series. Now an instructor at the Sherman College of Straight
Chiropractic in Spartanburg, S.C., he understands what the 11- and
12-year-olds from Toms River, located about 11 miles south of
Lakewood, are going through, what awaits them win or lose in
Saturday's championship game in Williamsport, Pa., and what great
potential they have for growth from this experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went from being an introverted type of person to being an
extroverted type,'' Reizer said. ``Having thousands of people come
to see us play, dealing with the media and speaking before so many
people helped me become very outgoing. To this day, I attribute the
success I've had as an individual to that Little League
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   While some former Little League champions have been haunted by
that success, encountering jealousy, broken friendships and
unrealized dreams that have sometimes outweighed the joy of winning
the World Series, Reizer and his 13 ex-teammates say nothing but
good came out of the summer of 1975. None made it to the major
leagues _ a reality that would have been difficult for them to
believe 23 years ago _ but none appear frustrated that they did
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We peaked early, in Little League,'' Bobby DelConte said
Friday with a laugh. ``I like to say we were washed up at 18.'' In
fact, nearly all of the Lakewood players became outstanding high
school players. DelConte, who threw a one-hitter in Lakewood's 4-3
World Series championship victory over Belmont Heights of Tampa,
Fla., also pitched six straight games while leading Lakewood High
School to a 1980 state title. Six of the other eight starters from
that Little League team, including DelConte's twin brother, Richie,
joined Bobby in that lineup.
</P>
<P>
   But high school baseball was about as far as most of them went.
Bobby DelConte attended Ohio University on scholarship as a
pitcher, but a shoulder injury during his freshman season ended his
career. Reizer, who was recruited to play baseball at Seton Hall,
never suited up because of knee injuries. Dion Lowe, the hardest
thrower and strongest hitter in 1975, went further than anyone
else, advancing to Class A in the Philadelphia Phillies farm
system.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe was one of three African-Americans on that Lakewood team,
which also had an African-American coach and a Puerto Rican player.
The team's racial makeup was representative of the community. But
to some extent, the camaraderie of the players stood in contrast to
the Ocean County town, which was plagued by several racial
incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Though baseball no longer plays a major role in their lives, all
appears well with the former Lakewood All-Stars. Lowe is a sales
representative in Atlanta. Bobby DelConte owns Del's Carpets in
Jackson, and Richie DelConte is an engineer at the Lakehurst Naval
Base in New Jersey. Wayne Richardson, the Lakewood center fielder,
is also an engineer. The catcher, Scott Schulman, known as
Slow-footed Schulman in Little League, is a podiatrist. All of the
other players, except for Alex Mendez, attended college, and he
owns a contracting business called All-Star Contracting in the
Lakewood area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing that every one of those kids stayed on the right
path,'' Mrs. Reizer said. ``They were a very intelligent group, and
they all had their heads screwed on right. They weren't losers back
then, and they're not losers now.''

ANGELS BEAT RED SOX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As the Angels congratulated each other on the field
after the final out of their 7-6 victory over the Boston Red Sox on
Friday night, an irate Troy Percival stormed toward the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   He was disgusted with himself after giving up three runs in the
ninth inning, needing a strikeout of Keith Mitchell with the
potential tying and winning runs on base to end it in front of a
sellout crowd of 32,470 at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hill, making his first start since elbow surgery June 15,
went six solid innings to get the victory, his first since June 4.
Hill (9-5) gave up three runs and eight hits, struck out two and
walked three while making 89 pitches. Red Sox starter Steve Avery
(9-6) got the loss.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Salmon led the Angels with three of their 13 hits and Todd
Greene's two-run single in the fifth inning snapped a 3-3 tie and
propelled the Angels to their fourth win in six games on the trip.
All 13 of the Angels' hits were singles.
</P>
<P>
   So the Angels' clubhouse was upbeat after the game. Except for
Percival.
</P>
<P>
   He sat alone drinking a beer after talking with reporters. In
the ninth, he walked two (one intentional) and gave up three
doubles, including a two-run double to Mo Vaughn and an RBI double
to Troy O'Leary. All three doubles were hit off the Green Monster
in left field.
</P>
<P>
   Percival was able to get Mitchell on a called third strike to
finish it off, then was intercepted by pitching coach Marcel
Lachemann as he marched off the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said I got the job done,'' Percival said of Lachemann's
brief chat. ``I was just mad at myself. What made me mad at myself
was going out there and throwing balls, walking people and wasting
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally if I get beat it's a walk and a homer. They were
playing pepper with that little porch (Green Monster) over there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a fastball-hitting team and he was throwing fastballs
at 'em, like he always does,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said of
Percival. ``They know how to hit in this park. They use the wall
effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for the Angels, they had some breathing room after
rallying from a three-run deficit. Hill allowed a run in the third
and two more in the fourth and the Angels trailed 3-0 to start the
fifth.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had two on and two out when Avery lost the strike
zone. He walked three in a row, the last two each forcing in a run
to make it 3-2. Salmon's RBI infield single tied it at 3, then
Greene hit one up the middle for two more and cap a five-run
inning.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, the Angels had the bases loaded and two out when
Troy Glaus hit a sharp grounder to the hole at short. Nomar
Garciaparra made a diving stop, but his throw to first was in the
dirt. When Mo Vaughn could not dig it out, two runs scored to give
the Angels a 7-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Hill took the lead through six innings and felt good about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finding my location was my biggest concern coming in,'' Hill
said. ``Be consistent and throw strikes, which I did. ... It seemed
like it's been forever (since he last pitched in a game).''
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, it was the same stuff he had when he was
dealing early in the year,'' Angels catcher Phil Nevin said of
Hill. ``He threw the ball good. As much as Jack (McDowell) was a
shot in the arm, Kenny's was just as big.''

   Allen Watson and Pep Harris got the Angels to the ninth, where
Percival finished it off _ barely. Percival pitched in only two of
the five games in New York, but because every game was close, he
got up in the bullpen in all but the second game of Wednesday's
doubleheader.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably didn't have the velocity he normally has,'' Nevin
said. ``And he had to throw more pitches than he probably should.
He's a maximum-effort pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to be perfect every time,'' Collins said. ``As
long as he gets 'em out, I don't care.''

RANGERS, WHITE SOX SLUG IT OUT FOR DOUBLEHEADER SPLIT
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa should have been at
Comiskey Park last night. With the way the ball was flying out of
the joint, who knows what kind of records they could have smashed.
</P>
<P>
   As it was, the Rangers and Chicago White Sox tied a 68-year-old
American League record with 14 home runs in a doubleheader. By the
time the carnage was complete, the two teams had each one won game
and the Rangers had lost a half-game to the Anaheim Angels in the
American League West standings.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers hit four in the first game, including a 10th-inning
smash by Will Clark that gave them a 6-5 victory. But the White Sox
had the late-inning heroics in the second game when a two-run homer
by Mike Cameron and back-to-back solo home runs by Ray Durham and
Mike Caruso in the eighth inning carried them to an 8-7 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball was jumping pretty good both games,'' Rangers manager
Johnny Oates said. ``There were a lot of balls hit to the warning
track. It was carrying pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, who trail the Angels by three games, created a
little history in the first game. For the first time in club
history, Juan Gonzalez, Clark and Ivan Rodriguez combined to hit
three consecutive home runs in the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   That gave the Rangers a 5-2 lead before the White Sox rallied to
tie the score on home runs from Albert Belle and Durham.
</P>
<P>
   That gave Clark a chance to enhance a reputation he has long
cultivated: a player who delivers in big games and clutch
situations. He earned that reputation back when he was with the San
Francisco Giants and was selected most valuable player of the 1989
National League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Rangers are headed into the stretch run of the
pennant race, Clark knows that reputation is on the line again.
</P>
<P>
   ``But nobody expects anything more than I do,'' Clark said. ``I
just know the last month of the season, needless to say, is
pressure-packed because you've got to win every game possible. But
it's also fun because you work hard to be in a position where the
games count.''
</P>
<P>
   He fulfilled expectations in the 10th when he smashed a 1-0
fastball from White Sox reliever Bob Howry over the left-field
fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a reason he's Will Clark,'' Oates said. ``You don't
get to be Will Clark by not getting big hits. You talk about him
being an impact player, nobody is going to say Will Clark is the
same player he was seven years ago. But Will Clark today is a
pretty good player.''
</P>
<P>
   The second game was another thriller although the Rangers looked
in control early when Royce Clayton's leadoff homer and a three-run
shot by Rusty Greer gave them a 5-1 lead in the third inning. But
they couldn't hold off the White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Starter John Burkett left after five innings holding a 5-3 lead.
But this game came down to the eighth inning and the Rangers unable
to turn over a 7-4 lead to closer John Wetteland.
</P>
<P>
   Xavier Hernandez normally has that responsibility, but he had
pitched two crucial scoreless innings in the first game. Oates
instead had to rely on Danny Patterson and Eric Gunderson. They
weren't up to the task.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson got the Rangers out of a jam in the seventh when, with
two out and two on, he got Wil Cordero to ground out. That left him
to face the bottom of the White Sox order in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Him being able to pitch the eighth was key to us,'' Oates
said. ``He's got the 7-8-9 hitters coming up. Three right-handers.
He usually gets those.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Magglio Ordonez doubled and Cameron homered, cutting
the Rangers' lead to 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson got Robert Machado on a fly ball, then Oates brought
in Gunderson to face Durham. They battled to a full count, then
Durham smashed a fastball over the left-field fence to tie the
score. Two pitches later, Caruso hit a fastball over the
right-field fence for the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to be a fastball pitcher with a limited
fastball,'' Gunderson said. ``What makes me mad is I lost the game
for our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark almost gave the Rangers another thrill in the ninth when
he belted another pitch from Howry deep to right. This time it hung
up just enough for Ordonez to catch it on the warning track.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking at the offensive production, seven runs should have
been enough,'' Oates said. ``But it was one of those games where
the bullpen couldn't hold it. They've been good all year, at least
some of them, but tonight they couldn't get it done.''

<P>
   Just when you thought it was safe to play fantasy football, the
beast has shuffled from the shadows, ready to destroy your season.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's true. The hideous, three-headed backfield has
returned.
</P>
<P>
   The horror.
</P>
<P>
   The monster is stirring on at least four NFL teams, where three
running backs will split time. Never mind that this scheme rarely
works in real football, it's positively devastating for fantasy
leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, the backfield is a mess.  &UR; Curtis Enis signed late
and will jockey for time with  &UR; Edgar Bennett and  &UR; Bam Morris. Any
one of these guys would be valuable as a full-time player; as a
trio, they're missing a baritone.
</P>
<P>
   Another quandary is brewing in Jacksonville, where starter
 &UR; James
 &UR; Stewart faces challenges from rookies  &UR; Fred Taylor and  &UR; Tavian
Banks. Taylor received the big build-up, but Banks is messing up
the predictions by playing better.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Louis, it was rookie  &UR; Robert Holcombe's job to lose, and
he's busy losing it. Slowed by a hamstring injury, the
highly-touted rookie is battling  &UR; Jerald Moore and  &UR; Greg Hill, who
recently escaped from
 &UR; Marty Schottenheimer's roomy doghouse in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants also will feature a backfield-by-committee, with
 &UR; Tiki
 &UR; Barber starting, but sharing time with  &UR; Gary Brown and  &UR; Tyrone
Wheatley. Expect Brown to handle goal-line duties; expect Wheatley
to fall down a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Other teams with a backfield identity crisis: Arizona ( &UR; Adrian
 &UR; Murrell and  &UR; Mario Bates), Baltimore ( &UR; Jay Graham and  &UR; Errict
Rhett), Dallas ( &UR; Emmitt Smith and  &UR; Chris Warren), New England
( &UR; Robert Edwards and  &UR; Sedrick Shaw) and Washington ( &UR; Terry Allen
and  &UR; Skip Hicks).
</P>
<P>
   Amid all that uncertainty, a good fantasy season depends on
picking the up-and-comers and avoiding the over-hyped duds. Some
predictions on sleepers, busts, rookies and a look at key
injuries: &QL; 
Sleepers
</P>
<P>
   Hate to be a homer, but Cardinals quarterback  &UR; Jake Plummer
looks poised for a big year. The offensive line leaks like the
Clinton grand jury, but Plummer still has receivers  &UR; Rob Moore and
 &UR; Frank Sanders. If the Snake can stay healthy, he should put up
gaudy numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite spending a few seasons mostly wrapped in bandages,
Eagles running back  &UR; Charlie Garner might be worth a pick. He's
gained weight to fight off those nagging injuries, and the Eagles
like to run the ball. Besides, the immortal  &UR; Duce Staley is his
backup.
</P>
<P>
   I'd also take a look at Washington bad-boy receiver  &UR; Michael
 &UR; Westbrook, who has yet to punch out any teammates this year, and
Atlanta wide-out  &UR; Tony Martin, who will be the favorite target of
quarterback  &UR; Chris ``Glass Body'' Chandler. For a tight-end, try
the Chiefs'  &UR; Tony Gonzalez. &QL; 
Busts
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals running back  &UR; Adrian Murrell has never been a
world-beater, and now he's running behind one of the worst
offensive lines in the league.
</P>
<P>
   In Dallas, Smith has shown flashes in the preseason, but he's
already a little dinged up. Add the presence of Warren, and it
looks like a long season for Emmitt. In Indianapolis, rookie
quarterback
 &UR; Peyton Manning is more Jughead than Archie. &QL; 
Rookies
</P>
<P>
   Despite some uh, personal indiscretions, Vikings rookie receiver
 &UR; Randy Moss has looked tough in preseason, catching passes almost at
will. With quarterback  &UR; Brad Johnson healthy after having his head
reattached, Moss could be worth six touchdowns and 700 yards.
</P>
<P>
   It's official. Chargers rookie quarterback  &UR; Ryan Leaf is a big
jerk. But with stumbling San Diego, Leaf should play all year and
put up decent stats. Everybody likes Holcombe, the Rams rookie,
though he's sputtered in the preseason. I think he'll eventually
start. &QL; 
Injuries
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo's  &UR; Andre Reed is nursing a sore hamstring, troublesome
for a wide receiver of his advanced age (34). Green Bay receiver
 &UR; Robert
 &UR; Brooks is coming off back surgery, and may not play in the opener.
</P>
<P>
   All eyes will be on 49ers receiver  &UR; Jerry Rice, who came back
too soon and reinjured his knee last season. Rice has been skipping
practices and won't play much in the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   And to think, tickets still cost $50. &QL;

FINALLY, TOMS RIVER GETS SOME POSITIVE PRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (With BBO-LITTLE-LEAGUE)  
(lh) 
 By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOMS RIVER, N.J. _ With dark clouds and roaring winds hovering
throughout the day, it would have seemed only natural for this town
to spend the day like much of the East Coast, bracing for the wrath
of Tropical Storm Bonnie.
</P>
<P>
   But Bonnie had no dominion here, for everyone calling this
resort community home was focused on a phenomenon of a different
nature, their scrappy band of Little Leaguers, the 12 freckle-faced
sluggers who barreled their way into the Little League World
Series, snatched the U.S. championship and put their hometown back
on the map. The game on Saturday in Williamsport, Pa., _ the one
where the Toms River East American All-Stars will battle Kashima,
Japan, for the Little League World Series championship _ is all
anyone cared to talk about.
</P>
<P>
   ``These boys have pumped so much adrenaline into this town,''
said Dave Corsi, who is on the board of the Toms River East Little
League, ``you can't go anywhere without somebody saying, `Can you
believe it's Toms River everyone is talking about?'''
</P>
<P>
   In fact for many people here, the talk about Little Leaguers is
a welcome relief from the other sorts of attention that the town
has received in recent years. In 1984, the town was the subject of
widespread news coverage of a grisly contract murder in which a
local businessman, Robert O. Marshall, was accused and convicted of
arranging the murder of his wife as part of a $1.5 million
insurance scam. The killing became the subject of a best-selling
book called ``Blind Faith'' and later spawned a television
miniseries.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Toms River has been the subject of news reports
and scientific studies of an unusually high number of cancer cases
among children. Some have speculated that drinking water is to
blame.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Baiamonte Amato's face tightened as she recalled the
damage done to her hometown's image by the murder and all the talk
about ``cancer-causing water.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are still real big lows for us; they spooked a lot of
people,'' she said today, measuring her words. ``But our little
guys are undoing all of that. People are finally going to see Toms
River as just another all-American town.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether they win or lose on Saturday, the fact the boys have
placed Toms River on the front page of nearly every newspaper in
the region is victory enough for many.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to have something to talk about that doesn't make us
ashamed anymore,'' Kevin Turner, 46, said as he and his son shared
sodas. They went to Mugsy's Bar and Grill Friday for the first
time, hoping to take part in any lingering festivities. ``I bet
next year there will be a whole lot of kids around the country
signing up for Little League because of Toms River.''
</P>
<P>
   The team's string of victories, which have included
spine-tingling catches and home runs, has unleashed such a
ferocious sense of civic pride that convenience store clerks had
difficulty keeping up with demand for copies of any newspaper with
the boys' pictures displayed. The handful of local Little League
officials who were still in town Friday raced around taking up
donations to pay for last-minute expenses and making preparations
for a homecoming celebration on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Corsi, the Little League board member, who had been in
Williamsport, returned to Toms River Friday afternoon in order to
oversee plans for the celebration. ``They've put us on cloud nine.
Now we have to say thank you in a big way.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that a storm was brewing did little to diminish the
energy around the party preparations. ``Who's Bonnie?'' George
Convery, a town commissioner and volunteer firefighter, joked as he
directed traffic away from an accident outside a local fire
station. ``We're too busy rooting for our boys to worry about
anything, even a little old storm.''
</P>
<P>
   The only real threat Bonnie caused here was in the winds, which
led some business owners to delay putting up congratulatory banners
and signs. But most of those who waited said the decision had less
to do with the storm than with their desire to see the outcome of
the final game before deciding how best to thank their heroes, as
they called them. City leaders and Little League supporters
promised that all of Toms River would be draped in signs and
banners by Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Convery said Friday that his fire station was already taking
names of residents who wanted to ride on one of the three fire
trucks that will greet the boys at the New Jersey border and escort
them back into Toms River. Some of the hopefuls were gathered
outside the station Friday, checking to see if they had made the
list. ``It feels like the world series or something. I want to make
sure my whole family is there to see every minute of it,'' said
Joanne Dulfey. ``This kind of attention may never happen to Toms
River again.''

<P>
   So, college football finally turns the corner.
</P>
<P>
   A new era. A new system. A new road leading out from the forest
of controversy.
</P>
<P>
   It is the year when ``Seinfeld'' ends, and a guy named Kramer is
in charge of crowning the national champion.
</P>
<P>
   It is the year when Notre Dame's shield of self-righteousness is
shattered by an age discrimination lawsuit, a booster who showered
players with the fruits of embezzlement and possible NCAA
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   And, best of all, it is the year when even Touchdown Jesus can't
help the Irish, a wonderfully ordinary team that has lost seven
home games in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   The year when a 26-year-old sophomore is Florida State's
starting quarterback. He may not be any good, but his ID is very
popular on campus.
</P>
<P>
   The year when the hypocrite known as Tom Osborne, a man who went
49-2 with three national titles in his final four seasons, is
finally watching from home. May he spend the rest of his days
munching Tostitos with Lawrence Phillips. &QL; 
More go bowling &QL; 
The year when two new bowl games are added to the glut of
postseason fare, bringing the number of lucky teams to 44, or a
hefty 39 percent of Division I-A.
</P>
<P>
   The year when Joe Paterno will win his 300th game, setting his
sights on Bear Bryant's all-time mark of 323.
</P>
<P>
   The year when Paterno's wholesome image finally takes a hit.
Last season, he allowed a sports information director to cast his
vote in the national poll. Now, the Chicago Bears are demanding to
know why Paterno didn't alert them to the bizarre nature of Curtis
Enis.
</P>
<P>
   The year when much rides on Roy Kramer. He is the SEC
commissioner who developed the formula involving polls, computer
rankings, strength of schedule and win-loss records that will
determine what teams are chosen for the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The year when the Rose Bowl, sigh, is brought to you by AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   The year when the Pac-10 should be more like the Big Ten. That
is, play your non-conference games first, working your way into the
conference skirmishes.
</P>
<P>
   The year when it's good to be out of the Windy City. Northern
Illinois leads the NCAA with an 18-game losing streak. Illinois is
in close pursuit, having dropped 17 straight. Both are chasing the
all-time mark of 34 set, of course, by Northwestern.
</P>
<P>
   The year when Texas' Ricky Williams breaks Tony Dorsett's
all-time rushing mark, a record once deemed untouchable, and runs
off with the Heisman Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   The year when four quarterbacks _ Daunte Culpepper, Tim Couch,
Brock Huard and Cade McNown _ settle for huge NFL signing bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   The year when Eddie Robinson is replaced by Doug Williams,
ending a 55-year legacy.
</P>
<P>
   The year when Ohio State _ a team that opens on the road against
a loaded West Virginia outfit, a team that has beaten Michigan only
once in the past 10 tries _ somehow ends up with the No. 1 ranking.
</P>
<P>
   The year when the best player you've never heard of is West
Virginia's Amos Zereoue.
</P>
<P>
   The year when Kansas State whips Nebraska in Manhattan, Kan.,
ending a 29-game drought.
</P>
<P>
   The year when LSU and Arizona State are the best of the long
shots.
</P>
<P>
   The year when UCLA and ASU really ought to be playing each
other. &QL; 
Waiting for November &QL; 
The year when three huge November games _ Florida State-Florida,
Nebraska-Kansas State, Ohio State-Michigan _ could make the bowl
picture very simple.
</P>
<P>
   The year when college football turns the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Or the year when three teams are undefeated in January, two of
which will end up in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   A year when the team left out of the party once again makes a
convincing case for No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   A year when the coaches' poll will crown the national champion
moments after the Fiesta Bowl is over.
</P>
<P>
   A year when the Associated Press poll of writers and
broadcasters waits until the next day to release its results and
opts for another co-championship.
</P>
<P>
   A year of disappointment when nothing changes under the Bowl
Championship Series, and all the suits and policymakers finally
recognize that Steve Spurrier is right.
</P>
<P>
   The year that college football decides it needs a playoff
system. &QL;

AMENDING CARDINALS HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Excerpts from my new book, ``Century of Glory,'' a revised
history of the pro football Cardinals who are celebrating their
100th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   __
</P>
<P>
   On a chilly autumn day in 1898 a Chicago football team finished
another head-butting practice on a neighborhood field, at 63rd and
Racine. Afterward, the captain called a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men, there are two things we need,'' Chris O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Helmets?'' a linebacker asked.
</P>
<P>
   The captain nodded. ``Right. What else?''
</P>
<P>
   When no one spoke, O'Brien said, ``We need a name.''
</P>
<P>
   The players offered suggestions. Cubs. White Sox. Bulls. Noting
the team wore red jerseys, someone said, ``How 'bout Cardinals?''
The Racine Cardinals were born.
</P>
<P>
   The moniker, however, was confusing. Tired of continually being
asked, ``You guys from Wisconsin?'' the Racine Cardinals became the
``Chicago'' Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Back then no one dreamed that the Cardinals, today the oldest
continuously run professional football franchise in the nation,
would change their name again, and again and . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   When the boy spotted him, he broke away from his mother and ran
toward the waiting train. Joe Bostic, feeling at tug at his sleeve,
looked down into a pair of adoring brown eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say it ain't so, Joe,'' the boy cried, blinking back tears.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals tackle shook his head. ``Sorry, kid.''
</P>
<P>
   The story covered the front page of the morning newspaper,
tucked under Bostic's arm. The banner headline in the
``Post-Dispatch'' _ ``BYE BYE, BIRDIES'' _ spoke of the sorrow
shared by everyone in St. Louis, every man, every woman, every
child. Beneath the giant black letters, ``City Says Goodbye to
Super Bowl Champs.''
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1988, only 14 months after they beat Denver,
37-3, in Super Bowl XXI, the Cardinals said farewell to the place
that had been their home for 28 years.
</P>
<P>
   Some fans felt betrayed. But most knew this day eventually would
come. The winningest team in the 1980s, the Cardinals _ ``America's
Team'' _ had become too popular, too big for St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   A new taxpayer-funded facility, twice the size of Busch Stadium,
was rising in the Arizona desert. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Gene Stallings looked up from his cheese enchiladas.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, you like him that much?''
</P>
<P>
   Across the table, George Boone gave the coach a smile, but he
was irked by the questioning tone. In 1987, the team's last year in
St. Louis, the Cardinals drafted Kelly Stouffer with their first
pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's she?'' smart-aleck fans had asked.
</P>
<P>
   Stouffer was a quarterback from Colorado State. He rejected the
Cardinals' generous contract offer, a negotiating strategy repeated
by another first-round draft choice, Andre Wadsworth, years later.
Stouffer never played for the Cardinals but went on to make a name
for himself in the frozen dinner industry.
</P>
<P>
   Criticized for the Stouffer fiasco, and for other dubious draft
choices, Boone, Cardinals director of player personnel, felt as if
he was being questioned again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like him? I ``love'' him,'' Boone said.
</P>
<P>
   And so, Tony Jeffery, a Texas Christian University Horned Frog,
became the first running back the Cardinals drafted since moving to
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The rest, as they say, is history.
</P>
<P>
   __ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The start of the 100th season was less than two weeks away and
contract talks were going nowhere. Time had become a factor, and no
one was more aware of the ticking clock than Vice President Bob
Ferguson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not upping the signing bonus. Forget that,'' Ferguson
said.
</P>
<P>
   The silence in the room was like a wall. It divided management
from the adversary seated across the table. The agent peered out
the window, glanced at his client and then gave Ferguson a haughty
smile the Cardinals executive had grown to hate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Okay. But we want four years. Two years voidable. And
appearance fees. We want ``double''.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson slammed his fist, and walked out of the room.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed unlikely now the Cardinals new mascot would be in
costume before the season opener. &QL;

ELWAY WILL FINAL SEASON BRING SUPER BOWL ENCORE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 Preview copy - Embargoed for editions Aug. 30 or later.  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER - They have the NFL's richest coach, most charitable
quarterback and classiest running back.
</P>
<P>
   So the Denver Broncos should have little trouble making the John
Elway Farewell Tour a rousing success.
</P>
<P>
   But it would have been so much easier for the defending Super
Bowl champions to repeat had Elway's recruiting mission earlier
this month been a success.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, offensive tackle Gary Zimmerman decided to stay in
Bend, Ore., running his tree farm, leaving the Broncos' offensive
line in a bit of a mess.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman's retirement has forced right tackle Tony Jones to
move to left tackle and 33-year-old Harry Swayne, who had no starts
a year ago, to take over Jones' spot. In addition, starting right
guard Brian Habib left for free-agent money in Seattle, and his
replacement, David Diaz-Infante, will be out for about six weeks
because of a knee injury. The starting left guard is second-year
pro Dan Neil, who has played in only three NFL games.
</P>
<P>
   If that's not scary enough, starting left guard Mark Schlereth
recently underwent his 21st knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   So it's no wonder the Broncos' offense has struggled at times in
the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensively, we're still not the team we need to be,'' said
running back Terrell Davis, who has three consecutive 1,000-yard
seasons. ``Generally, we've played with the same five guys up front
the last three years. Once we work together for a few games and
know who's doing what, we can adjust to the changes.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't have to be this way. When Elway went to Sturgis, S.D.,
on Aug. 6 to talk to Zimmerman at a motorcycle rally, he thought he
might be able to convince him to return for a 13th season.
</P>
<P>
   How big a story was it in Colorado? The ``Rocky Mountain News''
newspaper sent a columnist to Sturgis to try to find Zimmerman. He
sent back the following updates, chock full of hard news:
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman moved with some friends to populous Buffalo Chip
campground, where he will remain until Saturday. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of bikers, some of whom haven't bathed in some time,
delighted in seeing a sign in Deadwood (S.D.): ``Yo, bikers, take a
bath here, $1.''
</P>
<P>
   In Greeley, Colo., site of Elway's 16th and final training camp,
the ``Denver Post'' ran a daily feature on ``Elway, the Greeley
Years.''
</P>
<P>
   (At his first camp in 1983, the newspapers had an ``Elway
Watch,'' including reports that at one lunch, he failed to finish
his green beans. Another day, a writer, facetiously, reported on
the number of spirals per second on Elway's throws. Then, there was
the time he had to get a haircut at a secret location.)
</P>
<P>
   Elway, 37, said he won't get sentimental about his last season.
In fact, he laughed when asked whether opposing teams will present
him any gifts when the Broncos are on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their fans want to see me get killed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to (focus) on this being my last year. I've got
enough things I want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not talking about individual goals, even though the needs
only 1,331 yards passing to become the second player in NFL history
to throw for 50,000 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Elways always has been a team guy. Maybe that's why the future
Hall of Famer was known for three lopsided Super Bowl losses before
leading the Broncos to a 31-24 victory over Green Bay last January
in Super Bowl XXXII.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he hopes the Broncos can become the first team since the
1992-93 Dallas Cowboys to win back-to-back Super Bowl crowns.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday night, the Broncos beat the Packers, 34-31, at Mile
High Stadium in a preseason game that was a Super Bowl rematch.
Several Denver players said it was the loudest preseason game they
can remember.
</P>
<P>
   ``We proved that January wasn't a fluke, and we showed the
country who the better team was,'' Broncos linebacker Bill
Romanowski said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to send a message,'' tight end Shannon Sharpe said.
``We knew we had everybody's attention. We wanted to send a message
that we're for real. We're going to defend what we have. And you
are going to have to be on your best behavior if you are going to
beat us.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than the changes on the offensive line, the Broncos will
field pretty much the same team that won the NFL title a year ago
and led the league in total offense (367 yards per game), scoring
offense (472 points) and touchdowns (55).
</P>
<P>
   Gone is middle linebacker Allen Aldridge, who went to Detroit in
free agency, and defensive tackle Michael Dean Perry, who was
released.
</P>
<P>
   Aldridge has been replaced by seventh-year pro Glenn Cadrez and
Perry by Trevor Pryce, the Broncos' first-round pick a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really feel good about ourselves,'' defensive end Neil
Smith said. ``We definitely can repeat (as champions). The stage is
set. We just have to be up to the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Broncos owner Pat Bowlen shelled out enough money in the
off-season to keep everybody happy.
</P>
<P>
   Davis signed a nine-year deal worth $53 million.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Rod Smith was paid $19.2 million over six years.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Bowlen made Shanahan the highest-paid coach in the
league at a salary of more than $2.4 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question he's certainly got the horsepower to take
this team to the Super Bowl,'' Bowlen said. ``I think he and I both
expect that to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if his life has changed much, Shanahan said, ``My wife
told me to go and take out the garbage. So things haven't
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   While Shanahan doubled his salary this summer, Elway
restructured his contract to lower his base salary from $3.8
million to $300,000. The move helped the Broncos find enough
salary-cap room to sign their rookies.
</P>
<P>
   Don't feel sorry for Elway. He's not hurting for cash. He sold
his share of his automobile dealership empire to Wayne Huizenga.
</P>
<P>
   He also won't go away quietly.
</P>
<P>
   There was at least one interview request for Elway on each day
of training camp, including one from ``Pregnancy'' magazine. They
wanted to talk to him about being the father of four kids.
</P>
<P>
   On the last day of training camp, 75 of his teammates serenaded
him with the chant ``El-way. El-way.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL also has a new video out, titled ``Elway: Champions
Forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway didn't write a book after winning the Super Bowl. He said
he won't do that until he retires.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, meanwhile, has written an autobiography that was
published Friday. It's titled, ``TD: Dreams in Motion.''
</P>
<P>
   To promote the book, he is flying to New York on Tuesday to
appear on ``Late Show with David Letterman'' and ``Good Morning
America.'' He also is featured in ``GQ,'' ``Esquire'' and ``Rolling
Stone'' magazines and plans to do national commercials for Campbell
Soup and Nike.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates say fame hasn't changed Davis, who ran for 1,750
yards and 15 touchdowns last season. He also was the MVP in Super
Bowl XXXII with 157 rushing yards and three scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I like about him the most is what he does when he
doesn't have the ball in his hand,'' Sharpe said. ``He blocks his
butt off.''
</P>
<P>
   They use to say the same thing about Zimmerman. &QL;

JEFFERIES ADDED FOR LEADOFF, LEFT-FIELD ROLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Angels failed to make a big move before the July 31
non-waiver trading deadline, but general manager Bill Bavasi and
Co. have been busy since.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, they acquired outfielder Gregg Jefferies from the
Philadelphia Phillies for a minor-league player to be announced.
After the season, the Phillies will get to pick from a list of
eight ``fringe'' prospects to complete the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Acquiring the 31-year-old Jefferies is the second deal the
Angels have made after the non-waiver deadline. They also acquired
pitcher Jeff Juden on Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't any one move that put us over the hump,'' Bavasi
said. ``But collectively, we've changed the approach of the club.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferies hit .295 with 22 doubles, eight homers and 48 RBI for
the Phillies this season. He has a .292 career average, and is
expected to bat leadoff and play left field for the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brings some experience,'' Bavasi said. ``If (manager) Terry
(Collins) wants to use him in leadoff spot, he's done that. He just
makes us deeper. He's a guy who you're able to point to and say
`That's a guy who can hit and still run the bases good.' He's hit
for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferies is making $6 million this season in the final year of
his contract. The Angels will pay him $995,000 for the rest of the
season and have an option for next season.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies initiated talks at the request of Jefferies' agent
Seth Levinson when Jefferies learned the Phillies planned to give
prospects more playing time in the final month of the season
because the team is out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition means less playing time for Orlando Palmeiro and
Reggie Williams, two outfielders who have played well after being
called up from the minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're still going to play some,'' Bavasi said. ``They've
done a great job. What we don't want to do is fiddle with the
25-man roster that's done well. We're just trying to make us deeper
down the stretch, and that's what it does.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferies will join the club today in Boston, at which time the
Angels will have to clear a roster spot. They are expected to send
out Williams, but he would rejoin the team Tuesday when rosters can
be expanded.
</P>
<P>
   More moves: With Ken Hill activated to start Friday's game, the
Angels optioned pitcher Steve Sparks to Double-A Midland. However,
Sparks will be back to start Wednesday's game in Cleveland after
rosters expand.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks is eligible for postseason play because he would be able
to take the spot of a player on the disabled list. The Angels, by
the way, have set a club record by using the disabled list 22 times
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Attention please: The Angels didn't handle the influx of media
during the 1995 pennant race well. And it's a learning process
again as they were hounded in New York during the past week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants interviews,'' Collins said. ``There's always
more focus, always something people want to bring up what you want
to ignore. It's dealing with the things around the game. A lot of
the guys thought there's a lot of media now. They haven't seen
(anything) yet.''

FIRST SNAP IMPORTANT FOR CBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GINTONIO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grab the viewers and grab them quickly. Cut through all the hype
and spin. That's really the No. 1 task facing CBS-TV as it returns
to the world of professional football after a four-year absence.
</P>
<P>
   CBS, of course, is not a newcomer. It has 38 years of experience
under its belt, but when the regular season starts next week, and
the network begins its new run, there will be immediate comparisons
with Fox and ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to come out of the blocks strong,'' executive producer
Terry Ewert said. ``Fans and viewers can form their opinions early.
We'll have a new 3-D graphics system. This is all new, on the
cutting edge, and it will be fan friendly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to pay tribute to the tradition of CBS, but we'll have
new faces and a new energy and enthusiasm. It's just great to see
the renewed enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS, which has the rights to games in the AFC, will broadcast
102 games during the 17-week regular season and will show playoff
games and the conference title game.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the charge will be Greg Gumbel, the lead play-by-play
announcer. It's his face, name and voice that fans will immediately
associate with the network's football coverage, He'll be teamed
with Phil Simms (analyst) and Armen Keteyian (reporter).
</P>
<P>
   This is a perfect scenario for Gumbel, the prodigal son who is
returning to CBS after spending the last four with NBC, where his
versatility was put to good use. Home again, he'll be able to have
an immediate impact.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, it will be a priority for Gumbel and his crew to
establish a beachhead because comparisons to Fox's No. 1 team of
Pat Summerall and John Madden will be made. Gumbel has proven that
he can be opinionated while still doing an accurate and objective
play-by-play. Simms did a good job for NBC as an analyst in the
last Super Bowl, but it was his misfortune to be teamed with a
second analyst, Paul Maguire (now at ESPN), who packed a better
punch.
</P>
<P>
   Look for Gumbel to give Simms the opportunity, and more
importantly the time, to give fans a better idea of what is
happening on the field. But the magic won't happen overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for our first game (Sept. 6), I'm sure people will draw
some conclusions,'' Gumbel said. ``But is that an accurate
impression? I don't think so. Phil and I are still learning about
each other. We'll be fine the first week, but we'll be better in
Week 4, better in Week 7 and still better in Week 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chemistry is nice to have, and I think we have it, but I don't
think it's absolutely necessary to have it. But it's always nice to
like the other person, both in and out of the booth.''
</P>
<P>
   Gumbel said football's return to the network has helped him in
other ways, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated to leave CBS, and I'm happy to be back,'' he said.
``In many ways, I wish I would have stayed.''
</P>
<P>
   The No. 2 team at CBS will feature Verne Lundquist, Randy Cross
and Michele Tafoya. &QL; 
``Our Number 1 team is terrific, and to have a Number 2 team as
good as this is really something,'' Ewert said.
</P>
<P>
   Cross, a former offensive lineman for the 49ers, usually offers
excellent insight, and his outspokenness is a plus, Ewert said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is opinionated, and he doesn't mind speaking his mind,'' he
said. ``It's what we want. It's refreshing.''
</P>
<P>
   Cross keeps getting better, and his presence will add a lot of
clout to the broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Five other two-man teams also will be used, and insiders say the
play-by-play man to keep an eye on is Ian Eagle, whose partner will
be Mark May. ``This is a sleeper team,'' Ewert said.
</P>
<P>
   Eagle, who did well as a CBS play-by-play announcer in the NCAA
basketball tournament, has called games for the Nets and Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Cavolina and Mark Wolff will be the lead game director and
producer, respectively. Studio producer is Eric Mann.
</P>
<P>
   CBS' 39th year of pro football coverage begins next Sunday at 9
a.m. (Arizona time), with ``The NFL Today,'' an hourlong pre-game
show, hosted by Jim Nantz. Studio analysts will be Marcus Allen,
Brent Jones and George Seifert, with reporting by Bonnie Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   The studio will have two unique features: a ``video pond,''
built in billboard fashion into the floor in front of the main
desk, and an overall design to give the impression you are walking
into a stadium. &QL;

RED SOX RALLY FALLS SHORT BY PINCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The question of when Reggie Jefferson will be back, of course,
depends entirely on his back.
</P>
<P>
   And, in the aftermath of Friday's disclosure that Lou Merloni
has a stress fracture in his left knee instead of a deep bone
bruise, there's the gnawing fear that Jefferson's lower back strain
will later be revealed as something more _ say, something that will
have him in a brace and a Jordan's recliner for the rest of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   But in the absence of Jefferson _ or even Midre Cummings, who at
one time led the American League in pinch hits with seven until he
strained ligaments in his right wrist _ it's become apparent that
when Red Sox manager Jimy Williams looks down his bench for a
lefthanded pinch hitter, he sees very few options.
</P>
<P>
   And most of the time, he looks right past Orlando Merced, who
remained invisible as the newly recalled Keith Mitchell struck out
to end a 7-6 loss to the Anaheim Angels, fresh off their triumphant
tour of the Bronx. The Sox lost a half-game in the wild-card
standings when Texas split a doubleheader with the White Sox.
Boston leads the Rangers by eight games with 30 games to play, with
the Orioles 10 back.
</P>
<P>
   The Merced issue goes beyond Williams's decision to have
Mitchell bat against Angels blazer Troy Percival with three runs in
and two runners on in the bottom of the ninth, as the Red Sox, with
last at-bat doubles by Mike Benjamin, Mo Vaughn, and Troy O'Leary,
tried to salvage a game in which Steve Avery held a 3-0 lead before
blowing up.
</P>
<P>
   Williams had some sound reasons for using Mitchell, the
29-year-old journeyman minor leaguer back in a Sox uniform Friday
night because outfielder Damon Buford separated his rib cage and
was placed on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   The night before for Triple-A Pawtucket, Mitchell had five hits,
including two home runs. And Williams knew Mitchell well from their
days in the Atlanta system together.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I do know is he is a good fastball hitter,''
Williams said, ``and he's been playing every day, he's had some
at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had one hitter left that was lefthanded, Merced, but it was
my decision to stick with the kid. I know Merced can hit, too, but
he's not had the at-bats. It was my decision, so you guys
(reporters) do with it however you see fit. That's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Had Mitchell come through, of course, Williams would have been
spared any such line of questioning. As it was, Mitchell went down
on a 2-and-2 pitch that he claims expanded the inner part of the
strike zone to just off his shoelaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a tough pitch to swing at,'' said Mitchell, who had
taken good cuts at the previous two fastballs and fouled them both
back. ``If I hit it, I would have hit it off my shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Williams felt Mitchell was more game-ready than
Merced, that stems in part from Williams's decision to use Merced
sparingly since he came from the Twins in a trading-deadline deal
at the end of last month. Merced has had eight official at-bats
since coming to the Red Sox, four as a pinch hitter. He has yet to
collect his first hit with the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Add on the two weeks that he was buried in the doghouse of Twins
manager Tom Kelly, and Merced has more rust than Jefferson, who has
been on the DL since July 15 and is supposedly ready to play in
Sarasota tonight, according to team doctor Arthur Pappas.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was fitting that Merced was nowhere to be seen after
the game, either. For the moment, anyway, the 31-year-old Merced, a
nine-year veteran, has about as promising a Red Sox future as the
forgotten Billy Ashley.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Red Sox' comeback turned on Mitchell's punchout,
the game shifted when Avery came undone in the Angels' five-run
fifth inning as he walked three straight, two with the bases
loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Two of those walks came on 3-and-2 counts. The third, to Darin
Erstad, came on four straight wide of the plate. Derek Lowe
relieved and gave up a squib single by Tim Salmon in front of the
plate that allowed the tying run to score, and a bouncer over his
head by Todd Greene that brought home two more runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``With those 3-and-2 pitches, I had a chance to make one good
pitch and save a lot of headaches,'' said Avery. ``But I couldn't
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the night's biggest migraines belonged to Nomar
Garciaparra, who was called out at first base in the eighth inning
by umpire Dave Phillips, who ruled that Garciaparra missed the bag
while eluding a tag attempt by first baseman Erstad. Garciaparra,
whose right foot appeared to catch the inside of the bag as he beat
out a smash to third baseman Troy Glaus, walked slowly back to the
base after running down the line.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad flipped the ball to reliever Allen Watson, who flipped it
back to Erstad as Phillips made an ``out'' call that left
Garciaparra livid. By then, the Angels, who had taken three of five
from the Yankees in the Bronx, already had padded their lead to 7-3
against Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra limped into the trainer's room without a word to
reporters. Vaughn, despite three hits, including two doubles, was
of a similar mind. ``I'll talk to you tomorrow,'' he said.

2. Chiefs at Broncos, Dec. 6. &QL; 
3. Buccaneers at Packers, Sept. 13 &QL;

 &UR; Happy anniversary &QL; 
 &QL; 
One of the most-famous events in NFL history happened 30 years ago,
the ``Heidi Game.'' NBC switched to the childrens' classic
``Heidi'' from the New York Jets-Oakland Raiders game with 1:05
left and the Jets leading, 32-29. Viewers missed seeing the Raiders
score twice in nine seconds to come back and win, 43-32. &QL; 
 &UR; Happy anniversary II &QL; 
 &QL; 
Twenty years ago, one of the biggest gaffes in league history
occurred, a play known as the ``Miracle of the Meadowlands.'' The
New York Giants, running out the clock, tried a handoff, and there

One of the most-famous events in NFL history happened 30 years ago,
the ``Heidi Game.'' NBC switched to the childrens' classic
``Heidi'' from the New York Jets-Oakland Raiders game with 1:05
left and the Jets leading, 32-29. Viewers missed seeing the Raiders
score twice in nine seconds to come back and win, 43-32. &QL; 
 &UR; Happy anniversary II &QL; 
 &QL; 
Twenty years ago, one of the biggest gaffes in league history
occurred, a play known as the ``Miracle of the Meadowlands.'' The
New York Giants, running out the clock, tried a handoff, and there
was a fumbled exchange between quarterback Joe Pisarcik and
fullback Larry Csonka. Philadelphia defensive back Herman Edwards
picked up the fumble and went 26 yards with 20 seconds left for a
19-17 victory. All the Giants had to do was have Pisarcik take a

READY TO WIN AGAIN  
 BUT CARDINALS FANS HAVE HEARD IT BEFORE

 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - There has been renewed hope before, claims of
upgraded personnel, improved coaching, a locker room flushed of a
losing attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Cardinals typically win five or six games and their
credibility takes another hit.
</P>
<P>
   So here they go again with expectations perhaps greater than
ever thanks to a series of off-season moves that have strengthened
the roster. And fans are buying it. They believe that after years
of ``Great'' ``Expectorations'' the Cardinals are nothing to spit
at.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say that I ever have seen anything like this,'' Pro
Bowl receiver Rob Moore said. ``I've always heard guys in winning
programs talk about what it's like, the community support, the
crowds at their training camps. We finally got a taste of that.
That tells us that there really is support and enthusiasm out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The best thing the Cardinals can do is ``forget about the
expectations and just play ball,'' according to second-year
quarterback Jake Plummer, one of two former Arizona State crowd
favorites _ along with rookie safety Pat Tillman _ who has helped
legitimatize in the fans' eyes a franchise that for a decade has
been an unwanted child on the local sports scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't be worrying about stadium issues, or making the
playoffs, or any of that stuff,'' Plummer said. ``We've just got to
have a good start. When we go to Dallas on Sept. 6 we have to prove
that we can win on the road and win on (artificial) turf, which we
haven't done for a long time. That would be a confidence builder.
Then all of that other stuff will fall into place.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding a two-time 1,000-yard rusher like Adrian Murrell, and a
former ASU back like Mario Bates, and a rookie bulldog ball carrier
like Michael Pittman upgrades the league's worst rushing game.
</P>
<P>
   Picking up a return specialist like Eric Metcalf gives the
Cardinals exciting game-breaking potential every time he touches
the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Drafting a potentially dominating defensive end like Andre
Wadsworth gives them. . . . Well, not everything goes great when
you're historically a loser. Wadsworth, the third player chosen
overall in the draft, continues his holdout and is threatening to
sit out the season and go back into the 1999 draft if the Cardinals
do not meet his contract demands.
</P>
<P>
   With or without Wadsworth, the rookie class is shaping up as one
of the Cardinals' best ever. Safety Corey Chavous, offensive
lineman Anthony Clement, Pittman, tight end Terry Hardy and Tillman
all will play significantly.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Vince Tobin said he, too, is excited, but he knows there
are weaknesses that counterbalance the strengths.
</P>
<P>
   It is a young team. Sixteen projected starters and 27 of its
projected top 44 players have played four seasons or fewer in the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the offensive line we need to show that we have five guys
who can be the starters,'' Tobin said. ``Our running backs need to
be better than they were a year ago. The quarterback has to
continue to progress and stay healthy. I think the tights ends have
improved, but that still has to be shown in a game. The safeties
are inexperienced and we'll have to see how they play in the games
for real. We have one cornerback spot where the player has not
practiced because of injury and needs work. We lost our punter. Our
field-goal kicker was consistent inside the 40 but not outside.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to throw cold water on the excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are legitimate questions about our team,'' Tobin said.
``Are we better off right now than we were last year? Yes, we are.
We also had a better team last year than the year before, but we
didn't win as many games (4-12 last year, 7-9 the year before). But
being in close games is not what we're in it for. Now we've got to
win them. That's a big hump to get over.''
</P>
<P>
   Aeneas Williams, a Pro Bowl starter the past four years and the
Cardinals record-holder with six interception returns for
touchdowns, said the making or breaking of the club will be whether
it can ``learn how to finish teams off and win in the fourth
quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Two keys to that will be running the ball and stopping the run.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Simeon Rice, whose production tailed off last
season after a red-hot 1996 in which he was NFL Defensive Rookie of
the Year, is a key to the latter. Rice was injured, first losing
strength in training camp because of elevation sickness, then
suffering shoulder and hand injuries. He became the man opponents
ran at.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a one-hit wonder,'' Rice said. ``I've heard people say
I can't play the run, but I wasn't the third pick in the draft just
to be a pass rusher. I was the Big Ten leader in tackles for
losses. I've played the run well at every level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people realize how much I was restricted last
year. I had to constantly try to slip people because that's all I
had. I couldn't use my shoulder to bring more power. I couldn't use
my hand. I couldn't do my bread-and-butter moves.''
</P>
<P>
   A defensive front of Wadsworth, Pro Bowl tackle Eric Swann,
tackle Mark Smith and Rice would be cause for optimism.
</P>
<P>
   So is a backfield of Murrell, Bates and Pittman, joining Pro
Bowl fullback Larry Centers and Plummer. The Cardinals must be able
to run the ball to control the clock, wear foes down, and take
pressure off the passing game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been an area of great emphasis,'' Moore said. ``Marc
Trestman (new offensive coordinator) has a plan. That's one thing
that's different. He's put everybody in the best possible position
to make plays.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest hurdle of all remains the 5{ wins the Cardinals have
averaged for 10 years here. Rice said having a roster loaded with
youngsters is a plus because ``they have no recall of past bad
seasons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the three years I've been here we're almost totally new,''
Rice said. ``We're new-school now. Every guy here wants to be the
best now. That's what the young guys are seeing. That picks up the
persona of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Centers, who does recall past bad seasons but isn't married to
them, concurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest adjustment of all has been an improvement in the
overall attitude,'' Centers said. ``There are higher expectations
now, from ourselves and from the people around us.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is quite a bit different from what we are used to.
Accountability and responsibility have been addressed in the locker
room. Now we have to deliver and make this the Year of the
Cardinals.'' &QL;

MAN FOR ALL SEASONS  
 VERSATILE J.R. RED MOND HAS CHANCE AT HEISMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   Preview copy - Embargoed for editions Aug. 30 or later.

 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - ``Kealy, wait up!'' J.R. Redmond shouts after
practice. ``Don't leave without me.''
</P>
<P>
   The quarterback stops in his tracks. Even Ryan Kealy recognizes
that Arizona State's high-powered offense needs its motor.
</P>
<P>
   J.R. Redmond is, simply, the most versatile player in college
football. In addition to starting at tailback, the Heisman Trophy
candidate will play safety in nickel and dime packages, return
punts and kickoffs and line up wide as a receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Geez, can he play quarterback, too?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah,'' he said. ``Got a strong arm, but no accuracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind, this is the guy who threw a touchdown pass on a
halfback option his freshman season.
</P>
<P>
   The junior embraces his versatility. It's how he defines
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never think of myself as playing one position,'' he said.
``(Multiple jobs) make me whole. Complete.''
</P>
<P>
   Redmond has always thought of himself as a defensive player
first. Playing in the secondary has always seemed more natural to
him because that's where his roots are.
</P>
<P>
   In three seasons at southern California's Carson High, he
recorded 203 tackles, three interceptions and eight fumble
recoveries as a defensive back.
</P>
<P>
   He was a standout tailback, too. Just ask Franklin High. In the
first round of the 4A city playoffs in 1994, he rushed for 316
yards and six touchdowns. ``Six touchdowns.'' This from a guy who
says the position doesn't come naturally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say I'm about 90 percent,'' he said. ``I still need to
learn how to use the whole field.''
</P>
<P>
   He's managed well so far. His 159-yard all-purpose average last
season ranked 12th in the nation and third in the Pac-10. He
averaged 86.5 rushing yards. In ASU's opener against New Mexico
State, he had a 93-yard touchdown run.
</P>
<P>
   All as a second-stringer.
</P>
<P>
   Which prompts this question: What can he do as a starter?
</P>
<P>
   ``Aaargh, don't ask,'' Washington State Coach Mike Price said.
``He's one of the most difficult players to defend because he has
so many things going for him. He's fast, strong, smart. You can try
to do a million things to defend him but he always seems to find a
hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Price, who had a Heisman candidate in quarterback Ryan Leaf last
season, thinks Redmond has all the traits to make a run for the
award.
</P>
<P>
   Except maybe playing east of the Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West is not always best,'' CBS college football analyst
Craig James said. ``It's about TV exposure, the lateness of the
hour. It's about where many of the voters are based.''
</P>
<P>
   No player from the Pac-10 has won the Heisman since USC's Marcus
Allen in 1981, although five league players have been the NFL's No.
1 draft pick since then. The conference produces more NFL players
than any other.
</P>
<P>
   Only one winner in the past seven years, Colorado's Rashaan
Salaam, has come from west of the Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's indicative of where most of the media is,'' Pac-10
Commissioner Tom Hansen said. ``I don't think how the voting has
turned out has accurately reflected the talent our conference has.
I just don't feel confident that people always vote for the best
player.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know what influences people's vote,'' said ``USA
Today's'' Jack Carey, who compiles a weekly Heisman Watch box. ``Is
it literature they get in the mail? Who's in their region? It could
be a number of factors.''
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of early front-runner Ricky Williams of
Texas, the field figures to be balanced. Other running backs in the
picture include Wisconsin's Ron Dayne and West Virginia's Amos
Zereoue. The usual crop of quarterbacks include Kentucky's Tim
Couch, North Carolina's Dre' Bly, UCLA's Cade McNown and
Washington's Brock Huard.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond may have his region going against him, but he has other
factors working in his favor.
</P>
<P>
   Like last season's winner, Michigan's Charles Woodson, he has a
hook: He can play multiple positions.
</P>
<P>
   This is not Heisman propaganda, ASU Coach Bruce Snyder insists.
Redmond will play wide receiver because he can run nice routes and
has good hands. He will return punts and kickoffs because he's
tailor-made for the job. He will play defense because that is his
natural position anyway.
</P>
<P>
   If you see Redmond do any of these things, it's hard to believe
Snyder is snowing you.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Kendrick Bates, a talented tight end who was leveled by
Redmond during spring ball. Although the legend has grown greater
than the actual hit, it proved Redmond has what it takes.
</P>
<P>
   He's made most of his teammates look bad at some point during
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's fast, he's strong, he's versatile,'' safety Christon
Rance said. ``And he'll juke you.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder points out that Redmond's job is even trickier than
Woodson's. Woodson played defense and some offense. Redmond's
playing offense and some defense. It's a different dynamic.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is not a requirement of a candidate, a good story
catches the attention of national media. And Redmond has one.
</P>
<P>
   As a youth, he wore corrective leg braces because he was both
pigeon-toed and bowl-legged.
</P>
<P>
   As a 9-year-old, he nearly died in a car accident. He sister was
driving them home from church. Redmond was stretched out on the
backseat. A tire blew, his sister lost control, the car crashed and
Redmond slipped into a coma. His parents feared for his life.
</P>
<P>
   He awoke, but with 40 stitches in his forehead. The scar is
still visible.
</P>
<P>
   He also is one of the team's most charismatic players. J.R.
flocks to children as much as they flock to him.
</P>
<P>
   Don't think for a second Redmond is a man obsessed by the
Heisman. He never paid much attention to the award until Ohio
State's Eddie George won it, and that was 1995.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates still call him ``J.R.,'' not ``Heisman,'' and
never ask him to strike the pose.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they do, that's when things are starting to get too
different,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He is a sponge. He learned how to break tackles and hit the
defender before he's hit from former ASU tailback Michael Martin.
Part of what makes him such a great back is his confidence in that
contact.
</P>
<P>
   From Terry Battle, he learned how to see a hole and capitalize
on it.
</P>
<P>
   He likes to watch highlights of the NFL's best. He respects
backs who ``don't limit themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I don't trust my vision,'' he said. ``I've got to
trust my instincts.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder trusted his instincts after finally relenting to Redmond,
who used to bug ASU's coaches repeatedly to let him play other
positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to play everywhere,'' ASU running backs coach Cornell
Jackson said. ``And probably could.''
</P>
<P>
   And now he finds himself tagged ``Heisman candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I knew deep in my heart that I'd be a good player,''
he said. ``But I never, ever expected this pedestal they've put me
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Will this be Redmond's last season? It all depends on how the
year unfolds, but it's hard to believe the lure of the NFL won't be
too strong.
</P>
<P>
   The common beliefs seems to be: Enjoy him while you can. &QL;

REWRITING ARIZONA  
 `DEAN' TOMEY'S TEAM HINTS AT REVISED STYLE, CHARACTER 
</HEADLINE>
   Preview copy - Embargoed for editions Aug. 30 or later.  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, ARIZ. - At the Pacific-10 Conference's official media
day, Arizona's Dick Tomey was introduced as the league's dean.
</P>
<P>
   If Tomey were running the law school, he might welcome the
title. But in Tomey's business, the honorific can mean something
else altogether. Tenure is often trouble. Call Tomey the dean of
uncertainty. Welcome to the league's hot seat, sir.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he's sweating it. Tomey is a man with a wide
perspective. He watches more than just film. He can talk about
``Saving Private Ryan,'' history, books and a whole range of other
topics. His precarious spot in a precarious profession is
understood.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're in college football, there's going to be
speculation,'' said Tomey, who begins his 12th season as Arizona's
coach with one year left on his contract. ``It's stark and it's
real.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some people handle stress better than others, and I
think I'm one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   If stress is a byproduct of change, Tomey is doing just fine,
thank you very much. His Wildcats are a team in transition. Whether
the transition will happen fast enough to satisfy administration
and alumni is anybody's guess.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Wildcats are almost certain to be different in
style and identity than they have been in any other season in the
Tomey era. The Pac-10's old defense plant has undergone some
fundamental retooling.
</P>
<P>
   Desert Swarm might be giving way to Speedway Streak. At least,
Tomey and his restructured staff have the elements of a dynamic
offense. Even Arizona's best defensive player, preseason
All-American Chris McAlister, is a scoring threat who will return
kickoffs and do some double duty as a receiver.
</P>
<P>
   An irony is real concern about whether the Wildcats, with only
five starters back from last season's defense, will be able to stop
opponents from scoring. Potentially, this is more than a mere role
reversal. It has all the makings of a new identity.
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities offer a mix that is equal parts intrigue and
danger. Who are these guys? The wide range of preseason predictions
for the Wildcats, No. 24 in the`` Associated Press'' poll, is a
clear and present sign that they can be a big surprise or a huge
bust. From week to week, they could be both.
</P>
<P>
   Inconsistencies in the first scrimmage after camp at Cochise
College hinted at a team that could beat the very best and stumble
against the worst. The Wildcats play Pac-10 favorites UCLA and
Arizona State. The schedule also includes Northeast Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Sloppiness along both the offensive and defensive lines was
evident during the scrimmage. But McAlister and receivers Dennis
Northcutt and Jeremy McDaniel were always there with brilliant
speed and game-breaking potential.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's unpredictable prospects start at quarterback. Tomey
plans to use both Ortege Jenkins and Keith Smith through at least
the opener Thursday at Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Each will provide the offense with a different look. Smith is
the scrambler. Jenkins has the cannonarm. The guess is that
eventually one will emerge as the starter.
</P>
<P>
   Strictly on the basis of last season's 7-5 finish, the odds
would seem to favor Jenkins, a 6-foot-2 redshirt sophomore. He was
5-1 as a regular-season starter with 19 touchdown passes and only
three interceptions. Smith, a 5-11 redshirt junior, was 1-4 as a
starter with seven touchdowns and nine interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's Smith or Jenkins, Arizona's quarterback will be
blessed in at least one area. A fleet receiving corps might be
among the best in the Pac 10, if not the nation. Northcutt,
McDaniel, Malosi Leonard, Brad Brennan and an assist from McAlister
is a potential nightmare for secondaries.
</P>
<P>
   But that potential comes with a caveat. The offensive line is
inexperienced and mostly untested. Tomey foresees at least one
freshman, perhaps Makoa Frietas of Honolulu, as a starter. Concern
about the line was emphasized by the designation of center Bruce
Wiggins as the Most Valuable Player at Camp Cochise.
</P>
<P>
   At running back, the roster also is loaded with potential
talent. But the availability of Trung Canidate, the projected
starter from Central High School, is uncertain. Canidate rushed for
100.7 yards a game last season, but he is recovering from a stress
fracture.
</P>
<P>
   At press time, the academic eligibility of freshman Leo Mills, a
``Parade'' magazine All-American, was uncertain. For now, senior
Kelvin Eafon, a power runner, figures to be the starter against
Hawaii. But don't be surprised if sophomore Leon Callen gets a lot
of time. Callen, another ``Parade'' All-American, is returning from
a serious knee injury. He has world-class speed, which was evident
in preseason.
</P>
<P>
   What's left? Defense, or the lack of it.
</P>
<P>
   McAlister is the only returning starter in the secondary. Marcus
Bell and DaShon Polk return as starting linebackers. Along the
defensive line, there are tackle Daniel Greer and end Joe Tafoya.
</P>
<P>
   The line is of particular concern. In the season's early stages,
it might be manned by committee. In addition to Greer and Tafoya,
candidates for membership include Idris Haroon, Eli Wnek, Anthony
Thomas, Dolphin Tillman, James Lewis, Ash Burrows, Mike Robertson,
Alex Luna, J.J. Jopru and Olympic shot putter Chima Ugwu.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, special teams, often a disaster area last season,
also are the subject of some concern. Three punters _ Ryan
Springston, Chris Palic and Axel Trainer _ have had their chances.
Michael Johnson appears to have a lock on the kickoff job. The
place kicking belongs to Michale McDonald.
</P>
<P>
   Return duties? See McAlister, McDaniel and Northcutt. That all
three are seen often looms as Tomey's best chance at remaining the
Pac 10 dean. &QL;

HEATED EXCHANGE  
 LOCAL FOOTBALL COACHES WATER DOWN PRACTICES 
</HEADLINE>
 SCHOOLS-HEAT-ARIZONA-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GINTONIO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The answer would appear to be obvious. Arizona must be the state
where the heat takes the greatest toll on high school football
players going through preseason practices. It is 100-plus degrees,
isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   It just isn't so. Players in the state have been rushed to
hospital emergency rooms, but it has been 10 years since the last
reported death of a high school athlete because of heat-related
problems. Earlier this month, two prep players in Kansas died after
practicing.
</P>
<P>
   Even though players in the state usually make it through
training fine, the Kansas situations should be used as a wake-up
call, said Dr. Art Mollen, a Phoenix health and fitness physician.
</P>
<P>
   There appear to be two reasons that football players in Arizona,
especially in the Valley, are able to escape dire situations.
Players are more accustomed to the weather, and their coaches are
well-versed in the correct way to handle practices, giving their
teams adequate breaks and talking to them about the importance of
consuming large quantities of water.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious reported incident in the Valley this fall
involved a 13-year-old football player hospitalized for five days
after suffering heatstroke.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, most fatalities apparently come in the Midwest,
where players may not be as accustomed to the heat, the humidity or
the intensity of the sun. And it just might be coincidence that
mid-August, when high school teams are undergoing strenuous
practices, is usually the worst part of the summer in places such
as Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Acclimation is important, to be sure, but it goes far beyond
that, said Dr. Jeff Hill, the director of pediatric intensive care
at St. Joseph's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, people are very aware of the heat here and aware
of the need to take extra water,'' he said. ``We rarely get a child
sick enough to end up in intensive care, and we are one of the
hottest places in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, however, that it's more than heat that leads to
problems, and that may be why players in other states suffer more
serious problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the temperature, but also if you're in the sun, how much
radiant energy are you getting, and what is the humidity, which
affects the amount of evaporation going on and the ability to cool
yourself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a lot of humidity, and it's a day when the radiant
heat from the sun and the temperature are high, all of that
contributes to a much more dangerous condition than usual. We call
it the `wet bulb temperature.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Hill explained how tricky things can be. If the temperature is
only 75, but the radiant energy and humidity are high, a player
could suffer heatstroke.
</P>
<P>
   If a player gets symptoms of heatstroke, his coaches should make
sure he gets out of the sun and is wet down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give him water, fan him and get him into an air-conditioned
room,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   Most high school teams practice during the hottest part of the
day, but as Coach Jim Rattay of Desert Vista said, ``I think
everybody in Arizona is more cognizant of the heat. We don't ever
overdo it. Safety and health are more important.''
</P>
<P>
   Rattay's staff has to be extra careful because the team
practices for four hours, 4:30 to 8:30 p.m., in the preseason.
There is a half-hour break at 6 p.m., and no shoulder pads are worn
until after the break. Water troughs run constantly, and a player
is allowed to step away from a drill for a drink at any time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're real cautious about it,'' said Lloyd Willis, the
athletic director at North High School. ``We give out information
in the form of a memo to the coaches, reminding them to give the
kids plenty of opportunity for water. Other states may not think
about it as much because we're so hot here that we're cautious
because we're aware of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Educating players is also a priority, and coaches such as Larry
Fetkenhier at Glendale Cactus talk to their players about the
importance of potassium, as well as the necessity to drink water at
every opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Getting fluids helps in more ways than one, Cactus linebacker
Norman Boebert said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hot out there,'' he said. ``Sometimes you feel you can't
go anymore, and (without water) you can't stay mentally focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Just make sure the drink is water, Mollen cautions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's critically important to drink fluids before,
during and after exercise,'' said Mollen, who has run 30 marathons
and participated in 15 triathlons. ``But any replacement sports
drink has too much sugar and salt, and therefore can slow the
absorption of fluids.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for athletes to stick with water.''
</P>
<P>
   With all the precautions that can be taken, Mollen said, it is
still possible for an athlete to run into trouble. He said coaches
do a good job of educating players but that they need to consider
heat and humidity every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can happen rather insidiously,'' Mollen said. ``The next
thing you know, the player can go down.'' &QL;

   FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. - Jerome Souers may have to coach this Northern
Arizona University football team with one hand tied behind his
back.
</P>
<P>
   The new Lumberjacks coach, who served eight years as the
defensive coordinator at Division I-AA powerhouse Montana, is
accustomed to being in the middle of the action. But in his first
foray into the head-coaching wars, he knows a big part of his job
will be to watch things from a distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely, it's hard not to be hands-on,'' said Souers, who
helped guide Montana to the I-AA title in 1995. ``I've had to
struggle with that.''
</P>
<P>
   There are bigger issues to grapple with, such as figuring out
how to jump-start a program that was left without a head coach when
Steve Axman resigned after last season's 6-5 record. In the 1996
season, Axman guided NAU to a 9-3 record and a spot in the
postseason playoffs, the best showing in almost 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program has needs that I plan to address,'' Souers said.
``We lost some players (when Axman left), but the guys here are on
board fully, and we'll have more.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he inherits a relatively inexperienced team, Souers
isn't ready to concede that his first year will be dedicated only
to rebuilding. Of the 86 players, 42 will be new faces. Seven
players took advantage of a once-in-a-career NCAA rule that allows
a transfer from a I-A to a I-AA school without having to miss a
season. That gives the Lumberjacks, who lost 16 starters, a quick
fix.
</P>
<P>
   But Souers' stint at Montana proved that he's motivator, and he
has already devised a way to deliver on that in Flagstaff.
</P>
<P>
   College coaches can sometimes be as subtle as a ton of bricks,
but a Souers-inspired team promotional poster features seven
subliminal messages that he hopes will seep into the players' heads
and stay there.
</P>
<P>
   The words are tucked away among scenes of Northern Arizona. Six
of them _ effort, discipline, faith, unity, preparation and
persistence _ follow the script. The seventh message, ``black and
blue,'' isn't so subtle.
</P>
<P>
   ``That reflects our attitude and approach,'' Souers said.
</P>
<P>
   Black and blue: taking your lumps. These are concepts that
Souers knows about. He has been taking the good with the bad,
making smart moves over the years, but not above throwing in a
clunker every now and then.
</P>
<P>
   In his dozen years at Montana, there were 12 winning seasons,
three Big Sky Conference championships and the national crown. In
1996, he won two games as the interim head coach when Mick Dennehy
underwent surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our success at Montana took 12 years,'' Souers said. ``I bring
to the table a history of good and bad decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Souers, who said he had a ``good job'' in Missoula, was ready to
move on and become a head coach. When he visited Flagstaff, he was
prepared. He brought charts and graphs that were blueprints for
success.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, he had hoped to be the head coach at Montana.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it wasn't going to happen,'' he said. ``I would never say
that I deserved to be their head coach, but it was something I
aspired to.''
</P>
<P>
   Dwelling on the might-have-beens isn't Souers' style. He comes
into this season enthusiastically, anxious to imprint his style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Axman did a good job bringing the program to the level
it's at,'' Souers said. ``This year will be a rollover year, and
it's a challenge for the young players to reset the tradition. We
feel the need to set goals for good habits on and off the field.
I'm a firm believer that habits shape a person.''
</P>
<P>
   He said much more important than being ``another Montana'' is
for NAU to be itself.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime fans used to four-hour, 60-pass games may be surprised
to see a more balanced approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take what the defense gives you, it can give you the
game,'' Souers said. &QL;

NATION'S TOP TWO TEAMS TOUCH DOWN IN TEMPE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PHOENIX - On maps, they are designated by yellow spots no bigger
than kernels of corn. But in college football circles, they are
metropolises through which most roads to a national championship
flow.
</P>
<P>
   Every Saturday afternoon in the fall, normally tranquil places
such as Tallahassee and Gainesville, Fla.; Lincoln, Neb.; and Ann
Arbor, Mich., burgeon with thousands of fans who expect nothing
less from their teams than contention for a national championship.
</P>
<P>
   This year, all they want from their teams is a trip to Tempe for
the Fiesta Bowl Jan. 4. This season marks the debut of the Bowl
Championship Series, which is designed to guarantee a game between
the top two ranked teams in the country. The Fiesta Bowl won a
bidding process for the right to host the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``College football is the greatest game of all,'' said John
Junker, executive director of the Fiesta Bowl. ``And we have a shot
at having the greatest game in the greatest game.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the first time in college football that a bowl is assured
of featuring the top two ranked teams. That was made possible by
the Rose Bowl's decision to join the championship series, allowing
the Pac-10 and Big 10 champions to become part of the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's essential that a Pac-10 team team and Big 10 team have a
chance at a national championship,'' said Arizona Coach Dick Tomey.
``I'm anxious to see how it works out. I think it's a necessary
step for us, in not only recruiting, but in trying to solve the
national championship issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The bowl officials, conference commissioners and others who came
up with the revised bowl system did it in hopes of settling on a
true national champion and to quell the call for a playoff system.
</P>
<P>
   The Bowl Championship Series, which includes the Fiesta, Sugar,
Orange and Rose Bowls, is not foolproof. A complicated tie-breaking
formula using four components _ the AP and coaches polls, three
computer power ratings, strength of schedule and record _ will be
used to determine the top two teams.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy could come if a third team is ranked close to the
others and wins its bowl game, while the top-rated team loses in
the Fiesta Bowl. It's possible the third team could be chosen by
the polls as the national champion.
</P>
<P>
   There are still plenty of fans and coaches who would like to see
a playoff system instituted, where the top teams would participate
in a tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Junker argues that today's system is better for myriad reasons,
including the importance it places on each game. One loss and a
team's national championships hopes are damaged. Two losses and
those hopes are gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no other sport where absolutely every game means
something,'' Junker said. ``That results in emotion and excitement
that are nothing like any other sport.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to picking the favorites to play in Tempe Jan. 4,
most people round up the usual suspects. Ohio State is ranked No. 1
in preseason polls but Florida, Florida State, Nebraska and
Michigan, who have won at least a share of the last five national
titles, are expected to contend.
</P>
<P>
   Some fans are more confident than others about their teams'
chances. A Lincoln travel agency has already reserved 200 Valley
hotel rooms for Fiesta Bowl week, even though the Cornhuskers' have
a rookie head coach, Frank Solich, who is replacing the legendary
Tom Osborne.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nebraska will be there,'' said Pam Stream, who visited Arizona
last spring to book rooms for her employer, Adventure Travel of
Lincoln. ``I have no doubt.`
</P>
<P>
   Those booking trips had better buy refundable tickets because
even traditional powers have their question marks.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State will face huge obstacles at the beginning and end of
its schedule. The Buckeyes play at 11th-ranked West Virginia to
start the season and play host to Michigan on Nov. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Florida and Florida State have unsettled quarterback situations.
Nebraska must replace most of its offensive starters. Michigan lost
quarterback Brian Griese and cornerback Charles Woodson, who won
the Heisman Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   Fiesta Bowl officials are beginning to sense that the eyes of
the college football world are turning their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beginning two weeks ago, it was like someone flipped the
switch on,'' Junker said. ``The avalanche is coming, if it's not
here already.'' &QL;

PIAZZA STAYS ALL BUSINESS

<P>
   Mike Piazza spoke for as long as President Clinton, and with as
much feeling.
</P>
<P>
   No, he didn't tell Dodgers fans, ``I'm sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   His return-to-Dodger Stadium press conference was crammed into a
narrow walkway between the New York Mets' bench and bat rack and
cleverly scheduled to butt up against a pre-game team meeting, so
Piazza would be forced, darn the luck, to run off after four
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   When he ducked up the tunnel to the clubhouse, he left a lot
unsaid and a lot of questions unasked.
</P>
<P>
   Has he been looking forward to this? someone asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was,'' he said. Was?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little emotional for me, no question about it,'' said
Piazza, who was about to play in front of L.A. fans for the first
time in the 3{ months since he was traded to the Florida Marlins.
``It's good to be back, see some old friends and some places I've
spent a lot of time.''
</P>
<P>
   We'll have to take his word for it. Emotionally, he was under
wraps at the park Friday, from the moment he walked into the
clubhouse wearing a 1,000-yard stare, to the moment his line-drive,
solo home run off Carlos Perez sneaked over the 1959 sign in
left-center in the fifth inning, to the end of the Friday's game in
front of 52,154 fans.
</P>
<P>
   He was all about business, in a season that has been more about
business than baseball.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived 2 hours, 45 minutes before the 7:05 p.m. game to a
clubhouse in which most Mets were already in uniform. Piazza wore
jeans and a striped T-shirt. He walked past teammates and reporters
and greeted Jerry Turner, the visiting-clubhouse manager who is a
popular member of the old firm. He huddled with the Mets' PR man to
plan a media-containment strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Then he walked to his corner dressing cubicle, where a
brown-paper package awaited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get one of your helpers to open that,'' teammate John Franco
said to Turner, ``in case it goes off.'' Turner himself opened what
turned out to be a glass mug inscribed, ``Happy 30th Birthday, Mike
Piazza!'' He's 30 on Sept. 4.
</P>
<P>
   He read it silently and set the mug aside.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, as he got ready to stretch with the other Mets, a fan
with a camera shouted, ``Mr. Piazza!'' Momentarily forgetting
himself, Piazza turned to look, then quickly resumed his
straight-ahead stare before the picture could be snapped.
</P>
<P>
   While Piazza stretched, Dodgers general manager Tom Lasorda
happened, just happened, to walk by. The two hugged. A
slow-reacting TV cameraman, sacrificing self-respect for a story,
shouted, ``Can you hug again?'' They didn't.
</P>
<P>
   The stands were filling as batting practice began. Some kids on
the blue level wore T-shirts spelling P-I-A-Z-Z-A. He hit a bunch
of batting-practice home runs, two of which clanked on the
left-field pavilion roof and ended up in the parking lot. Piazza
didn't react.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever he was holding in, its power seemed to have seeped into
his bat.
</P>
<P>
   The display drew cheers and boos in equal numbers, establishing
a pattern the fans would follow when Piazza's name was announced
fourth in the lineup, and when he stepped into the batter's box in
the first inning and tipped his helmet.
</P>
<P>
   A funny thing happened on the way to the Hall of Fame, where
Piazza was supposed to be be heading before this hellish season in
which he and his agent misjudged the Dodgers' generosity and
rejected an $85 million contract offer; he was traded twice in
eight days; and he began this series in Los Angeles with a .311
average, 25 homers and 86 RBI, enough to make him the most valuable
National League catcher but far enough below his standard to elicit
boos at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   What he is now is a basically good man handling a long, hot
summer the best way he knows how. He's wary of New York reporters,
wary of everybody. The chances he'll return to the Mets are rated
slim. The Angels are one of the teams he'd consider, but they'll
have to be willing to spend money in what would constitute a rare
surprise ending from Disney.
</P>
<P>
   Next season is one of the topics that could not be squeezed into
four minutes.
</P>
<P>
   There was an invitation to unburden himself: Do you have
anything to say to the fans?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I pretty much said everything when I left, how I felt
about the fans and the support I received when I played here,''
Piazza said, referring to his printed statement May 15. ``So I
don't think there's really any need right now to (go over) old
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   If you wanted more _ contrition? _ maybe you're being unfair. If
he opens a vein, he becomes a $7.5 million a year ballplayer
seeking sympathy, and he's smart enough to know how well that would
go over.
</P>
<P>
   If you wanted more of what he really thinks and really feels,
you'll have to wait for another night.
</P>

   &UR; The BIG games &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Five biggest regular-season games:
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 5 _ Ohio St. at West Virginia (Buckeyes' No. 1 ranking
faces early test)
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 10 _ LSU at Florida (We'll see whether the Tigers are for
real)
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 14 _ Nebraska at Kansas State (Wildcats haven't beaten the
Huskers since '68)
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 21 _ Florida at Florida State (Always a classic)
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 21 _ Michigan at Ohio State (John Cooper: 1-8-1 vs.
Wolverines) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Three cream puffs to go &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Five horrible  &UR; non-conference schedules:
</P>
<P>
   1. Kansas State (Indiana State, Northern Illinois, Northeast
Louisiana)
</P>
<P>
   2. Washington State (Illinois, Boise St., Idaho)
</P>
<P>
   3. Mississippi (Memphis, SMU, Arkansas State)
</P>
<P>
   4. Wisconsin (San Diego St., Ohio, UNLV)
</P>
<P>
   5. Northwestern (UNLV, Duke, Rice) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; A QB state &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Arizona has emerged in recent years as fertile ground
 &UR; for quarterbacks. Here's a few that most coaches wouldn't mind
having:
</P>
<P>
   1. Tim Rattay: Formerly of Phoenix Christian, now lighting it up
for Louisiana Tech.
</P>
<P>
   2. Ryan Kealy: St. Mary's graduate, impressive as a freshman
last year at ASU.
</P>
<P>
   3. Graham Leigh: Dobson High graduate led New Mexico to the
Insight.com Bowl last year.
</P>
<P>
   4. Joe Germaine: Mesa Mountain View product is one reason Ohio
State is ranked No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   5. Travis Brown: Formerly of Moon Valley, looking to rebound
from poor sophomore season at NAU. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Tough schedules &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Five coaches with long-term contracts or short-term
 &UR; brains:
</P>
<P>
   1. BYU's LaVell Edwards (schedules Alabama, ASU, Washington)
</P>
<P>
   2. Washington's Jim Lambright (BYU, Nebraska, Utah State)
</P>
<P>
   3. USC's Paul Hackett (Purdue, Florida State, Notre Dame)
</P>
<P>
   4. Syracuse's Paul Pasqualoni (Tennessee, Michigan, North
Carolina State)
</P>
<P>
   5. New Mexico State's Tony Samuel (Texas, Georgia Tech, Colorado
State) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Who are they? &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Five good players you might not have heard of:
</P>
<P>
   1. BYU running back Rodney Jenkins _ WAC freshman of the year in
1996, missed last year for violating the school's honor code. He'll
be one of the best backs in the West.
</P>
<P>
   2. Syracuse FB Rob Konrad _ At 6 feet 3, 255 pounds, he still
has the speed to play tailback. A senior, he has been hurt much of
his career.
</P>
<P>
   3. Florida St. DE Roland Seymour _ The Seminoles have had an
All-American at defensive end for the past four years. Seymour, a
sophomore, could make it five straight.
</P>
<P>
   4. Colorado St. RB Kevin McDougal _ Gained 1,111 yards last year
as a junior.
</P>
<P>
   5. Louisiana Tech QB Tim Rattay _ He passed for 3,881 yards and
34 touchdowns last season. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; On the bubble &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Four coaches on the hot seat  &UR; this season:
</P>
<P>
   1. Arizona's Dick Tomey _ In the final year of his contract with
the best skill position talent he has had.
</P>
<P>
   2. Duke's Fred Goldsmith _ The Blue Devils have lost 18 straight
ACC games. Goldsmith, in his fourth year, must produce.
</P>
<P>
   3. Colorado's Rick Neuheisel _ Coming off their first losing
season since 1984, Buffs then had to forfeit their five wins for
using an ineligible player. Neuheisel is under pressure to turn
things around quickly.
</P>
<P>
   4. Oklahoma's John Blake _ Blake fired his coordinators after
last season. If the Sooners have another losing season, the blame
will be put on his shoulders. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; The latest fad &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; It's becoming increasingly trendy in college football
 &UR; for athletes to play both defense and offense. Michigan's Charles
 &UR; Woodson did it last  &UR; year, and several of this year's top players
have
 &UR; similar plans. Here are some of the top players, with their regular
 &UR; position listed first:
</P>
<P>
   1. ASU's J.R. Redmond _ Running back/defensive back
</P>
<P>
   2. Arizona's Chris McAlister _ Cornerback/receiver &QL; 
3. North Carolina's Dre Bly _ Cornerback/receiver
</P>
<P>
   4. Alabama's Fernando Bryant _ Cornerback/receiver
</P>
<P>
   5. Georgia's Champ Bailey _ Cornerback/receiver &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Say what? &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Five statements sure to fire up Tostitos Fiesta Bowl
 &UR; Executive Director John Junker:
</P>
<P>
   1. ``This bowl system seems archaic.''
</P>
<P>
   2. ``Those 2,500 volunteers of yours don't seem to do much.''
</P>
<P>
   3. ``These chips taste OK once they're smothered in cheese and
salsa.''
</P>
<P>
   4. ``Who came up with your new logo, someone on acid?''
</P>
<P>
   5. ``OK, so you're in charge of one game. What do you do the
rest of the year?'' &QL;

 Preview copy - Embargoed for editions Aug. 30 or later.  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
 
 1. UCLA BRUINS 
 
 1997 stock: 10-2 overall, 7-1 Pac-10. 
 Author: Bob Toledo (44-44, 8 years, 2 at UCLA). 
 New editions: OL Mike Safer, RB DeShaun Foster, QB Ryan McCann, DB
Lovell Houston. 
 Out of print: TB Skip Hicks, T Chad Overhauser, WR Jim McElroy, LB
Brian Willmer, S Shaun Williams. 
 A bestseller if: Senior QB Cade McNown resembles the country's most
efficient quarterback that he was last year. If top-notch safety
Larry Atkins can elevate the play of the rest of the defense, the
Bruins are in good shape. Chris Sailer handles punts, field goals,
extra points and kickoffs, and does it well. 
 In the bargain bin if: Replacing seven defensive starters proves to
be too difficult a task. Tailback Hicks was no slouch, either. UCLA
hasn't found a big-play man at wide receiver yet. The loss of
safety Shaun Williams will hurt. 
 
 2. ASU SUN DEVILS 
 
 1997 stock: 9-3 overall, 6-2 Pac-10. 
 Author: Bruce Snyder (109-88-5, 18 years, 6 years at ASU). 
 New editions: DT Junior Ioane, DE Erik Flowers, WR Justin Taplin,
TE Todd Heap, LB Alfred Williams. 
 Out of print: G Kyle Murphy, LB Pat Tillman, CB Jason Simmons, SS
Damien Richardson, TB Michael Martin, DT Jeremy Staat, DE Vince
Amey. 
 A bestseller if: The defense can compensate for seven new starters.
There is no question the unit is talented, but inexperience could
play a role. The team also needs to get off to a strong start with
wins over Washington and Brigham Young. By then, many of the
newcomers will have their feet wet. 
 In the bargain bin if: The offensive line gets banged up. The
position is talented but thin. J.R. Redmond is a big-time tailback,
but even he needs a little protection. 
  
 3. ARIZONA WILDCATS 
 
 1997 stock: 7-5 overall, 4-4 Pac-10. 
 Author: Dick Tomey (135-97-7, 21 years, 11 at Arizona). 
 New editions: OL Chris Redding, OL Aaron Higginbotham, OL Makoa
Freitas, K Mike Johnson. 
 Out of print: OT Jose Portilla, WR Rodney Williams, DE Joe
Salave'a, DE Jimmy Sprotte, SS Rashee Johnson, LB Chester Burnett. 
 A bestseller if: The Wildcats get better line play than expected.
Other areas appear to be falling into place. The offense could be
explosive with the return of Trung Canidate and some speed at wide
receiver. They also have a favorable schedule. 
 In the bargain bin if: The defense breaks down. The Wildcats will
start a lot of young players on the unit, and talented cornerback
Chris McAlister can't carry the load. Also, the defensive front is
quick but small, which could leave it vulnerable against some
Pac-10 opponents. 
  
 4. WASHINGTON HUSKIES 
 
 1997 stock: 8-4 overall, 5-3 Pac-10. 
 Author: Jim Lambright (38-19-1, 5 years). 
 New editions: DL Toalei Mulitauaopele, FL Dane Looker, DL Odell
George, DB Roger Faagata. 
 Out of print: SE Jerome Pathon, G Benji Olson, TB Rashaan Shehee,
LB Jason Chorak. 
 A bestseller if: Quarterback Brock Huard proves he made the right
decision by passing up serious NFL money to return for his junior
season. The offensive line should be solid. An impressive infusion
of recruits and junior college transfers could fill some big holes.
The starting punter and kicker return. 
 In the bargain bin if: The Huskies can't handle their tough early
schedule. The first three games include trips to Arizona State and
Nebraska and a home meeting against Brigham Young. Lambright is
still searching for a tailback. The job could go to a true
freshman. The defensive line lacks depth. 
  
 5. USC TROJANS 
 
 1997 stock: 6-5 overall, 4-4 Pac-10. 
 Author: Paul Hackett (13-20-1, 3 years, first at USC). 
 New editions: TB Sultan McCullough, QB Carson Palmer, OT Matt
Welch, CB Tanqueray Clark, TB Miguel Fletcher. 
 Out of print: FB Rodney Sermons, TB Delon Washington, CB Brian
Kelly, DE George Perry, G Chris Brymer, WR Rod Perry. 
 A bestseller if: USC makes the most of its schedule. The Trojans
play seven home games, including five of their first six, in the
Coliseum. The most experienced secondary in the conference returns,
including big-play man Daylon McCutcheon. Kicker Adam Abrams is
back for his fourth season, and the receiving corps is fast and
deep. 
 In the bargain bin if: The Trojans can't find a tailback.
Additionally, questions surround the offensive line because of
injuries, and junior college transfers may be asked to step up.
Wide receiver Rod Perry left to play on the baseball team, and
several key players are walking academic tightropes. 
  
 6. OREGON DUCKS 
 
 1997 stock: 7-5 overall, 3-5 Pac-10. 
 Author: Mike Bellotti (45-38, 8 years, 3 at Oregon). 
 New editions: DL Faiva Talaeai, FB Chad Chance, RB Reuben Droughns,
TE Enyi Nwamuo, PK Nathan Villegas. 
 Out of print: TB Saladin McCullough, SE Pat Johnson, TE Blake
Spence, FS Jaiya Figueras, DT Desmond Byrd, LB Garth White. 
 A bestseller if: The Ducks make the most of rotating their
quarterbacks, Akili Smith and Jason Maas. They will be helped by an
offensive line that returns all but one starter. Split end Damon
Griffin looks good after missing last season because of a thumb
injury. Peter Sirmon returns at inside linebacker and figures to be
the heart of the defense. Special teams again expect to be solid. 
 In the bargain bin if: Injuries take their toll, especially on the
talented but thin offensive line. The Ducks also sport an unproven
running game. The team must replace starters at tailback, fullback
and tight end. Defensive line lacks size. Coaching staff still in
search of a consistent place-kicker. 
  
 7. WASHINGTON ST. COUGARS 
 
 1997 stock: 10-2 overall, 7-1 Pac-10. 
 Author: Mike Price (99-93, 17 years, 9 at Washington State). 
 New editions: RB Kevin Brown, DB Chris Martin, QB Bryan Paul, DL
Ing Aleaga, WR Alexe Rodopolos, WR Tim Lemon. 
 Out of print: QB Ryan Leaf, RB Michael Black, RT Ryan McShane, LG
Jason McEndoo, T Leon Bender, DE Dorian Boose, DE Shane Doyle. 
 A bestseller if: The Cougars capitalize on their team speed. They
have up-and-coming talent at linebacker and in the secondary, and
Price gets the most from his personnel. Their somewhat easy early
schedule will help work out kinks. Freshmen linebackers Raonall
Smith and Tupo Tuupo come from a Mark Fields mold. 
 In the bargain bin if: Losing quarterback Leaf and tailback Black
proves too much to overcome. Seven other offensive starters are
gone. Only one of the ``Fab Five'' receivers remain, and the
defensive line lacks depth after losing three starters. 
  
 8. STANFORD CARDINAL 
 
 1997 stock: 5-6 overall, 3-5 Pac-10. 
 Author: Tyrone Willingham (19-15-1, 3 years). 
 New editions: DL Matt Leonard, DL Trey Freeman, DB Chijioke
Asomugha, DB Garry Cobb, DB Brian Taylor. 
 Out of print: QB Chad Hutchinson, RB Anthony Bookman, WR Damon
Dunn, DE Kailee Wong, CB Corey Hill, DE Bryan Werner. 
 A bestseller if: The offensive line helps the rest of the offense
develop. Four starting linemen return, led by center Mike
McLaughlin. Troy Walters, the league's top receiver and punt
returner last season, is back, and the secondary has a year of
experience under its belt. 
 In the bargain bin if: No miracles come Stanford's way. Eight
defensive starters are gone. The running game is inexperienced, and
the team will miss quarterback Chad Hutchinson, who signed a
professional baseball contract. Many of the starters will be
underclassmen. 
  
 9. CAL GOLDEN BEARS 
 
 1997 stock: 3-8 overall, 1-7 Pac-10. 
 Author: Tom Holmoe (3-8, 1 year). 
 New editions: DT Kasey Jackson, S Damien Marzett, WR Mike
Ainsworth, WR Ronnie Davenport. 
 Out of print: WR Bobby Shaw, TB Tarik Smith, C Jeremy Newberry, OT
Brian Shields, DT Brandon Whiting, CB Kato Serwanga. 
 A bestseller if: The defense can win games. The front seven is
talented and deep, and the nine returning starters on that unit are
the most in the league. Sophomore Marcus Fields may be one of the
league's more underrated tailbacks. Players believe in Holmoe and
in the direction of the program. Quarterback Justin Vedder enters
the season with better understanding of the West Coast offense. 
 In the bargain bin if: Wide receiver Dameane Douglas can't make up
for the loss of Bobby Shaw. Team speed, a problem last year, should
be again. The Bears gave up 24 touchdown passes last year, the most
in the Pac-10, and must replace two starters on the offensive
line. 
 
 10. OREGON STATE BEAVERS 
 
 1997 stock: 3-8 overall, 0-8 Pac-10. 
 Author: Mike Riley (3-8, 1 year). 
 New editions: QB Terrence Bryant, OT Jason White, TE Greg Petty, CB
Karriem Adams, TB Isaac White, NG Paul Luoma. 
 Out of print: OG Freddie Perez, OT Trey Hyde, LB Nathan McAtee, CB
Basheer Elah ee. 
 A bestseller if: The Beavers take advantage of their experience.
Nobody in the conference returns more starters. Look out for Toalei
Talataina, who returns from a two-year mission. He lettered at
linebacker in 1994 and 1995 but has put on 30 pounds and likely
will play defensive end. 
 In the bargain bin if: That experienced offense plays like it did
last season. It ranked among the worst in the conference in most
major categories. No starter on the defensive front is taller than
6 feet, and only one weighs more than 245. The offensive line lacks
depth.

</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-RIGHTS (Oak Bluffs, Mass.) _ An emotional President
Clinton said Friday that he had been wrestling with the process of
forgiveness _ both as a seeker of it from his family and the
nation, and as one who forgives his enemies. By Katharine Q.
Seelye. (With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   NY-PORN-SHOP (New York) _ A state judge dealt a blow on Friday
to New York City's efforts to curtail the pornography industry,
ruling that Show World, a midtown Manhattan porn emporium, and two
other adult video stores can stay in business as long as no more
than 40 percent of their floor space and inventory are dedicated to
adult entertainment. By David Rohde.
</P>
<P>
   ARTS-IVEY (Washington) _ In the days since the House voted to
spare the National Endowment for the Arts, and made clear that the
stay of execution was more or less permanent, the new chairman of
the agency has begun talking out loud about all that suddenly seems
possible: more money, less rancor, even ``a New Deal without the
Depression, with murals painted all over the country and music
composed.'' By Melinda Henneberger.
</P>
<P>
   SKINHEADS (Las Vegas) _ Indeed, for nearly two decades,
anti-racist skinheads have been confronting racist skinheads from
coast to coast. Over the years, the two sides have slashed each
other's tires and bashed each other over their shaved heads, but
the violence usually stopped there. By Don Terry. (With photos.)
</P>
<P>
   NEV-POLITICS (Las Vegas) _ Although the polls show Aaron Russo
trailing in his bid to win the Republican nomination to succeed
Gov. Bob Miller, his presence in the race has turned what was
expected to be a cakewalk for the party's favorite into a
competitive, and colorful, contest. Russo has insisted that
Nevadans are paying too much in taxes, while the casino industry _
which for 18 years has paid 6 1/4 percent of its gross revenue _ is
paying too little. ``They own the state,'' Russo said of the
gambling businesses. By Brett Pulley. (With photo.)

   RUSSIA-RDP (Moscow) _ A tired President Yeltsin bluntly
dismissed rumors on Friday that he would quit over Russia's
financial crisis and vowed to serve out his full term to 2000 and
then retire. Other developments in Moscow; efforts to calm the
political and economic frenzy. By Michael Wines.
</P>
<P>
   ATTACK-U.S. (Washington) _ Some of the key statements made by
administration officials to justify the missile attack on Sudan
have proven to be inaccurate, misleading or open to question. By
Tim Weiner and Steven Lee Myers.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-U.S. (Washington) _ Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich
said Friday that President Clinton's plans to visit Moscow next
week to meet the beleaguered President Boris Yeltsin were
``imprudent'' and should be canceled. But Clinton was undeterred,
speaking at Martha's Vineyard, Mass., about the importance of
friendship in difficult times, and vowing to press ahead with the
meeting and with an effort to aid Russia if the new government
there did ``the disciplined, hard things they have to do to reform
their country.'' By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   CONGO-ARMY-VOLUNTEERS (Kinshasa, Congo) _ Kinshasa is filled
these days with young men who have volunteered to join the army,
compelled by vague notions of duty and the unshakable belief that
Congo has been attacked by the hated Tutsi and their Rwandan
backers. Each morning, except on Sundays, they can be seen milling
around La Cite's sports stadiums, waiting to join the military or
to begin their drills. By Norimitsu Onishi. (With graphic.)

   MARKET (New York) _ Stock prices fell sharply again Friday, as
continued fears about instability in Russia and economic weakness
closer to home produced the worst week for the American stock
market in nine years. By Edward Wyatt. (With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-ECON (Tokyo) _ One statistic stands out to explain the
importance of Japan, along with its misery: When trading ended
Friday in Tokyo, Japanese stocks this week alone had dropped in
value by $241 billion _ a sum that exceeds the size of the entire
Russian economy at present exchange rates. A month after Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi took office, vowing ``to deal with each issue
in a dramatic, speedy way,'' Japan remains firmly in recession and
largely paralyzed politically and economically. By Nicholas D.
Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-BANKAMERICA (Undated) _ The financial maelstrom ripping
through markets in Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America added two
more banks to the growing casualty list of trading houses and
lenders swept into the storm's path. And while all eyes remain
focused on Russia's travails, it is now clearly apparent that
volatility in more economically significant countries like Brazil
and Argentina is eating into the profits of some financial concerns
doing business there. By Timothy L. O'Brien. (With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   HONGKONG-ECON (Hong Kong) _ In the climax of an unprecedented
two-week-long direct intervention in the stock market, Hong Kong's
government spent what traders estimated at $8 billion Friday in a
frenzied buying spree to prop up shares and foil speculators it
accuses of manipulating its market. On Thursday, an earlier round
of intervention had managed to push the Hong Kong stock market up
while every other market around the globe was down. Friday, for all
the money spent, the benchmark Hang Seng index still declined 93.23
points, or 1.2 percent, to 7,829.74. By Mark Landler. (With
graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   MARKET-SMALL-INVESTORS (New York) _ From the fashion industry's
workrooms on Seventh Avenue to the exercise bicycles in private
midtown clubs to the carpeted waiting rooms in storefront brokerage
offices, New Yorkers watched as the markets dipped and climbed and
dipped again Friday. By the time the Dow finally settled at 8051.68
_ down 114.31 points, or 1.4 percent _ most still seemed unworried
by Wall Street's sudden turn toward bear market territory. By James
Barron and David Barboza.
</P>
<P>
   MARKET-FED (Jackson Hole, Wyo.) _ The latest round of global
financial turmoil is forcing the Federal Reserve Board to shift its
sights from guarding against inflation through higher interest
rates to the possibility that it might have to reduce rates to head
off an economic downturn, central bank officials and economists
said Friday. By Richard W. Stevenson.

COLLEGE SEA SON TO KICK OFF TODAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dick Tomey chuckles every time he hears it. After the opening
weekend of NFL action, some player or coach will mention that his
team is still working out some bugs, even though it's been
practicing for six weeks and has played four or five exhibition
games.
</P>
<P>
   This is what Tomey and other college coaches are thinking: Try
playing a real game after practicing for less than a month, with no
tuneup games and with little hitting because your whole season can
hang on the health of one or two players.
</P>
<P>
   And try facing opening day with a roster full of wildly
unpredictable 18- to 23-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the magic things about college football,'' Tomey
said.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Tomey thought his team was well prepared for its
season opener at Oregon. Then, he watched the Ducks' Saladin
McCullough return the opening kickoff 93 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't really know what's going to happen when they kick
the ball off,'' he said. ``I hope what happened last year when they
kicked the ball off doesn't happen this year. Because what happened
last year was not good.''
</P>
<P>
   The unknowns are what make the college football season
interesting. It all begins today with two early games _ Nebraska
vs. Louisiana Tech and Colorado State vs. Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
   Can Frank Solich successfully follow a legend, Tom Osborne, at
Nebraska? Can Florida and Florida State overcome inexperience at
quarterback to contend for national titles?
</P>
<P>
   And in today's games, can Phoenix native Tim Rattay quarterback
Louisiana Tech to an upset in Lincoln? Can Colorado State prove it
really belongs with the Michigan States of the college football
world?
</P>
<P>
   Yet, some things might not be any clearer at the end of the
season. Like how the Bowl Championship Series' rating system works,
or how Kansas State Coach Bill Snyder was born without a humor
gene, or why Fred and Lamont are now sponsors of the Sanford
Independence Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The real deal? &QL;  &QL; 
The pressures on Nebraska sophomore quarterback Bobby Newcombe are
not hard to define: Just run like former Heisman Trophy winner
Johnny Rodgers and operate the offense as well as former
quarterback Tommie Frazier.
</P>
<P>
   If Newcombe does that, he'll be fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm comfortable with the expectations,'' said Newcombe, a
four-sport athlete at Albuquerque's Highland High. ``It's just one
of those things that comes with playing football at Nebraska.''
</P>
<P>
   Newcombe played wingback and returned punts last year. His best
game was against Oklahoma, when he caught a 40-yard touchdown pass
and returned a punt 57 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times when you think you have him, and then he has
that little bit of extra speed, that burst or whatever, and he
leaves the defense behind,'' Nebraska linebacker Jay Foreman
said. &QL;  &QL; 
Oh, brother &QL;  &QL; 
They've slept together, fought together and even been fired
together. Now, the Ryan boys will facing each other on opposite
side lines.
</P>
<P>
   Rex and Rob Ryan, twin sons and former assistants of ex-Cardinal
Coach and General Manager Buddy, will match wits Oct. 24 when
Oklahoma plays Oklahoma State.
</P>
<P>
   After last season, Rex moved from Cincinnati to become the
defensive coordinator at Oklahoma. Rob enjoyed a successful season
last year at Oklahoma State, where he is the defensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing red &QL;  &QL; 
Top three reasons Tomey and ASU Coach Bruce Snyder will hate
watching Nebraska play this year:
</P>
<P>
   1. Receiver Kenny Cheatam, a senior from South Mountain High, is
starting for the Cornhuskers.
</P>
<P>
   2. Safety Mike Brown, a junior from Scottsdale Saguaro High, is
starting for the Cornhuskers.
</P>
<P>
   3. Linebacker Eric Johnson, a junior from Alhambra High, is
starting for the Cornhuskers.
</P>
<P>
   Where's Jack Mildren? &QL;  &QL; 
Oklahoma Coach John Blake, 7-16 in two seasons, is bringing back
the wishbone in hopes of rekindling past glory.

COOPER: WE BEAT OURSELVES  
 MERCURY UNDERSTANDS COMETS WILL IMPROVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<P>
   HOUSTON _ It's not 'ova.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Comets (29-4) insist that it wasn't Maria Stepanova
or Andrea Kuklova or anyone else on the Mercury who put them a game
away from elimination in the WNBA Finals, which will resume at 1
p.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   A defiant Cynthia Cooper said Phoenix (22-12) could have played
its assistant coaches in the opener and ``it wouldn't have
mattered, because the bottom line was we couldn't throw a pea in
the ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-time league Most Valuable Player warned the Mercury to
worry about an offense that produced only 54 points Thursday,
presuming that Houston will be nowhere near 51 again.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets' league-high 76.2-point scoring average suggests that
Cooper is correct. And Houston has not lost consecutive games since
a meaningless pair at the end of the 1997 regular season that did
not hinder a brief two-game run to the inaugural WNBA championship.
</P>
<P>
   This year's expanded playoff format, with Game 1 of a
best-of-three series at the lower seed's home, creates more
opportunity for uncertainty. The Mercury made the most of its X
factor (the Mercury crowd), but overcoming Y and Z (expected
sellouts of 16,285 today and, should Houston pull even, Tuesday) is
another matter.
</P>
<P>
   Not that a noisy Compaq Center or Madison Square Garden or MCI
Center affects Phoenix, too familiar with its own rowdy fans to
care much if the yelling is in reverse. That's but one reason why
the Comets would be well-served to force, not expect, a win today.
</P>
<P>
   This is not your midseason Mercury, 1-6 through the back half of
July, including two losses to Houston. This is not even your
early-season Mercury, 11-3 thanks to veterans, depth and
enthusiasm, but not chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury that has won 10 of its last 13 games plays with the
maturity that its international roster (three Australians and one
each from Germany, Slovakia and Russia) and American overseas
veterans bring to the court each game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're tough, these girls who have come over here,'' said
point guard Michele Timms, an Australian. ``We believe we deserve
to be here, and we're here for a reason. We honestly think we can
win it. That's a real nice, quiet confidence we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in the worst of times, five consecutive losses in 11 days,
Phoenix maintained contact. There was a 15-pointer, the largest
losing margin of the season, in Los Angeles, but only one other
defeat of more than 10 points. Eight of the losses are by a
combined 20 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basketball we've been playing against Houston in the past
is when we were in our slump,'' center Jennifer Gillom said. ``This
is a totally different team, and I think they realize that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but the Comets didn't win 90 percent of their
regular-season games and sweep Charlotte in the playoff semifinals
by fearing anyone.
</P>
<P>
   They will come back confident that their 32.3 percent shooting
(24.4 minus Cooper's 11 for 24) was an aberration and that
defensively they can again contain the Mercury (34.9 percent;
Gillom and Timms 29 percent on a combined 9 for 31).
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to have a shot at a three-pointer to tie it at the end
after shooting 32 percent and getting outrebounded by nine, I was
amazed that we even had a shot at the end,'' Houston Coach Van
Chancellor said.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets' two home wins over Phoenix, 72-62 on July 28 and
75-64 on Aug. 6, were close inside the final five minutes until
Houston pulled away.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Kim Perrot, just 1 for 12 Thursday, was 7 for 10 in
the Aug. 6 game, including six critical points after Phoenix
stormed back from a 16-point deficit to trail by one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been able to eliminate that four- or five-minute gap to
where we're only playing for a minute or so out of sync,'' Mercury
assistant coach Kathy Anderson said. ``We're not panicking and
trying to do things we haven't done all night. That's where we've
made great strides, with our poise. We've been able to cut out a
number of dead spots.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury will play its fifth game in eight days, one more
than the Comets, and draw on the lesson learned in a Game 2
semifinals loss to Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't match the (emotional) intangibles, the X's and O's
are irrelevant,'' Anderson said. ``The scenario is exactly what we
faced at Cleveland. They came out with such intensity, and we
expect nothing less from Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our players know this is far from a given. What we still have
to do will be harder than anything we've attempted to do all year.
We have to go to a whole new level.'' &QL;

1 REDMOND, 2 BIG JOBS FOR ASU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are rumblings among the faithful. Concern for J.R.
Redmond. Apprehension about taking a Heisman Trophy candidate,
throwing him out on the other side of the ball, risking nothing but
injury and a national championship in hopes of shoring up the
secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Snyder smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want me to say something really arrogant?'' the Arizona
State coach asked. ``I don't know if anyone knows more football
than I do. I know that sounds arrogant, but I say that almost being
humble. I really believe I know what the hell I'm doing. I've made
mistakes before, but I'm not going to do something stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary. This little experiment with Redmond could be a
brilliant maneuver. Because when you get past the hype, when you
see an offense loaded with weapons and a defense thin around the
edges, the idea makes perfect sense.
</P>
<P>
   And in the long run, Redmond's greatest contribution to the Sun
Devils could come on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of playmakers on offense,'' Redmond said. ``I'm
not sure we have that on defense. I'm not sure how many playmakers
we have. That's what I can provide. I think I have a natural knack
for the ball.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Working man &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With a pivotal opening game against Washington just a week away,
Redmond has a full itinerary. He will run the football, catch the
football, return kicks and play safety in nickel packages. He has
begun studying next Saturday's season-opening opposing quarterback,
the talented Brock Huard of the Washington Huskies. And the
tendencies of their receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond's efforts on defense will be under scrutiny, because if
he shows big-play capability, his role will be expanded. And if he
turns out to be the latest in a two-way trend championed by Deion
Sanders and Charles Woodson, ASU will have one side of the field
under wraps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very thin in our natural defensive secondary, so this
gives us help in depth,'' Snyder said. ``And the third-down
conversion is maybe the most important down in football. This gives
us a chance to get another fine athlete on the field. The ball will
be in the air, and J.R. is great with the ball in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   So maybe it takes away from Redmond's productivity on offense.
With quarterback Ryan Kealy and the best set of receivers ever to
step on campus, it shouldn't make a difference. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Passing on the hype &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As for this Heisman stuff, well, forget about it. The landscape
of college football is loaded with front-runners, from Texas' Ricky
Williams to Ohio State's Andy Katzenmoyer to Kentucky's Tim Couch.
From UCLA's Cade McNown to Central Florida's Daunte Culpepper to
Huard.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond would have to be a combination of Barry Sanders and Mel
Gray to leapfrog this group. And for all his talent, remember this:
</P>
<P>
   Redmond has started one game at tailback.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Heisman is nothing that's ever crossed my mind,'' Redmond
said. ``And nothing I've ever been interested in. The people that
think that highly about my game, well, I appreciate it, and I thank
them. But I just want to be a well-rounded player. And I want to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   As for injury, well, Redmond knows the risks. He also knows what
fear can do to a football player.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minute you start thinking about it, it happens,'' Redmond
said. ``I know because it happened to me. My freshman year against
Boise State, I saw someone get their legs taken out from under
them, and it looked like it hurt real bad. I started thinking about
getting injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``And sure enough, a couple plays later, I sprained (a medial
collateral ligament) on a punt return. I don't worry about that
stuff anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Yep, in football, you can't play scared. Can't coach scared,
either. Even when it comes to a commodity like Redmond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he'll make two to three interceptions this year that
really make a difference,'' Snyder said. ``Then it will be worth
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in the worst-case scenario, it's worth a shot. And the
risk. &QL;

A CLASSIC: MADDUX STYMIES MCGWIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The feelings were mutual. Mark McGwire wasn't
thrilled to be facing Greg Maddux Friday night, and Maddux returned
the favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't give you anything to hit,'' McGwire said on
Thursday, the day before he was to face Maddux. ``He never throws
one across the plate. It's always on the outside corner, or the
inside corner. He's just a great pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux smiled when he began his obvious observation. ``He's a
good hitter, man _ he's got power,'' he said. ``I want to see him
get the record as much as anybody. But I don't want to give up a
hit to him, let alone a home run. So it's kind of messed up. I'd
love to see him get the necessary home runs, but let him start
hitting them when we leave town.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the professional respect that the world's best pitcher,
who is 6 feet and weighs 175 pounds, and its leading home run
hitter, at 6 feet 5 inches and 245 pounds, hold for one another.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's Cardinals met Maddux's Braves Friday night in the
second game of their four-game series at Busch Stadium. It was, as
the saying goes in such a development, a classic confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   But of course more than just this was at stake, for, as most
people know by now, McGwire is in pursuit of the single-season home
run record, perhaps the most significant record in American sports.
He has hit 54, one more than Sammy Sosa of the Cubs, and just eight
behind Roger Maris, who set the record of 61 in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I'm concerned about pitching to him,'' Maddux said.
``Wouldn't you be? Look at how big he is. If he hits the ball back
to the mound, he wouldn't just hit it off you, he'd hit it through
you.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire did none of the above, and he also did not hit a home
run. He went 1-for-3, with a double, a pair of walks and a
strikeout off Maddux and two relievers, Rudy Seanez and Dennis
Martinez, in the Cardinals' 5-4 victory in 10 innings.
</P>
<P>
   It was left not to McGwire, but to Ron Gant to be the night's
hero, as he singled with the bases loaded and two out in the bottom
of the 10th to drive in the winning run.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In McGwire's first trip to the plate in the first inning, with
one out and a man on base in a scoreless game, the right-handed
slugger worked the count against the right-handed Maddux to 3-2,
and walked.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux, not the hardest thrower but perhaps the canniest, is
tied for most victories in the National League, with 17 against six
losses, and leads the major leagues in earned run average with
1.91.
</P>
<P>
   Before Friday night's game, McGwire had batted against Maddux
nine times since being traded from Oakland in the American League
about midway during the 1997 season. He is 2-for-8 with a walk and
four strikeouts. No home runs.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, with the Braves' infield shifted to the left side,
and with the second baseman playing behind second base, McGwire hit
a shot just beyond the second baseman and hustled into second,
sliding in to beat the outfielder's throw for a double.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux said he would pitch to McGwire because the prime
challenge for him, he said, is ``to beat the Cardinals'' _ unless
first base is open with men in scoring position. ``I wouldn't want
to walk him,'' Maddux said, ``but I'd have to.''
</P>
<P>
   In the top of the fifth, with the Braves batting, some in the
crowd of 45,666 _ as well as some on the field _ may have noticed
the unobtrusive but pregnant figure of ``53'' go up in a small
corner of the center-field scoreboard where, a moment before, it
had listed: ``McGwire 54/Sosa 52.''
</P>
<P>
   Now McGwire was just one homer ahead of the Cubs' right fielder.
In cases like this, McGwire has often responded to the challenge
with a home run.
</P>
<P>
   Not this time. With a man on first and two out, Maddux walked
McGwire again on a 3-2 pitch. Boos rang out through the park. The
fans were expressing their displeasure at the pitcher for depriving
their slugger of his hack at the plate in pursuit of the record.
</P>
<P>
   With the Braves having taken the lead in the game, 4-3, the
right-handed Seanez replaced Maddux to start the eighth, and struck
out McGwire, who took a fierce third-strike swing. It was his
second straight game without a home run.
</P>
<P>
   In the 10th, after a home run by Fernando Tatis had tied the
game an inning before, McGwire came to bat with the score tied at
4-4, two men on and one out. Martinez was now on the mound, and
everyone in the ballpark was standing in anticipation of their
Mighty Casey delivering the game-winning blow. But on a 2-2 pitch,
Martinez whistled a called third strike past McGwire, who grimaced
at either the umpire, or himself.

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
At this rate, Randy Johnson may never lose a start at the
Astrodome.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Better yet, opposing teams may never score a run.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson pitched his third shutout at home and struck out a
season-high 16 on Friday night as the Astros pulled out a scrappy
2-0 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates before a crowd of 40,709.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's 27 (scoreless innings at home) in a row,'' Astros
manager Larry Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   But who's counting?
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, acquired from the Seattle Mariners on July 31, set a
club single-game record for strikeouts by a lefthander and recorded
the most strikeouts by an Astros pitcher since Nolan Ryan fanned 16
Giants on Sept. 9, 1987. Johnson fell two K's shy of the
club-record 18 set by Don Wilson in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   There was one primary word Johnson's teammates used in
describing his latest performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow,'' second baseman Craig Biggio said. ``He was totally
dominant.''
</P>
<P>
   The Big Unit needed an intensity-filled performance Friday as he
and Pittsburgh righthander Francisco Cordova matched scoreless
frames for the first five innings. Brad Ausmus broke the gridlock,
beating a throw to home plate on the first of two fielder's-choice
RBI grounders by Biggio.
</P>
<P>
   In three Astrodome starts, Johnson (5-1) has allowed no runs, 17
hits and three walks while striking out 37. He had 10 strikeouts
through five innings against the Pirates and capped off the
impressive display by striking out the side to end the game.
Johnson scattered seven hits and did not allow a walk while
throwing 133 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cordova is a heck of a pitcher,'' said Johnson, whose
major-league totals this season include 274 strikeouts and five
shutouts. ``He kept their team in the game the whole time and just
made it tougher for me. I have no leeway to make a bad pitch. I
have to stay focused the whole game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pittsburgh is a very disciplined, scrappy team. Those are the
teams that make me work extremely hard, because they're in the game
the whole time and make you throw a lot of pitches. It doesn't give
me any room for error.''
</P>
<P>
   In snapping the Pirates' nine-game winning streak, the Astros
won for the 16th time in their last 21 games and remained 10 games
ahead of second-place Chicago in the National League Central. They
also matched last year's victory total of 84 and established a
franchise record for wins in August with 19.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't come easy, however, as Cordova (12-11) continued to be
an Astros nemesis, scattering four hits and one run over seven
innings. In 11 career appearances against the Astros, Cordova is
3-2 with a 2.69 ERA. He pitched 5 scoreless innings Friday before
Ausmus doubled to lead off the sixth inning, advanced on a balk and
scored on Biggio's grounder, beating second baseman Kevin
Polcovich's throw to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Ausmus' sixth-inning hit, the Astros managed just a
single by Moises Alou in the second and Dave Clark's two-out double
in the fourth off Cordova.
</P>
<P>
   Ausmus and Biggio repeated their sixth-inning scoring play with
an almost identical one with one out in the eighth. Ausmus reached
base to begin the inning on a bunt to the third-base side that
reliever Mike Williams couldn't handle. One batter later, Ausmus
took second on a third-strike wild pitch from Williams to Johnson
and advanced to third on a throwing error by Pittsburgh catcher
Jason Kendall. Biggio drove in the run with a grounder to shortstop
as Ausmus once again beat the play at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the Pirates,'' Dierker said. ``This is the way we
remember them last year. It's hard to score against them. They're
tough. Cordova still has us mystified.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Johnson had the Pirates guessing as he seemingly
gained strength as the game progressed. His 16 strikeouts eclipsed
Mike Cuellar's previous club mark of 15 by a lefthander _ set
against St. Louis in 1966 _ and marked Johnson's 98th career
double-digit strikeout game, moving him past Sandy Koufax into
second place on the all-time list. Nolan Ryan holds the record at
215.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had his velocity back,'' Ausmus said. ``He's probably
thrown as many or more pitches than anyone in baseball this year.
When you're a strikeout pitcher, you have to throw a few extra
pitches. Maybe (Thursday's day off) helped him out. It showed on
the mound.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates' biggest scoring threat came in the eighth when they
put runners at first and third. Adrian Brown singled with one out,
and Kendall singled to right field, with Brown advancing to third
on an error by Clark. Johnson ended the threat by getting Kevin
Young to pop out to first baseman Jeff Bagwell in foul territory.
</P>
<P>
   With the Astros clinging to a one-run lead, Johnson knew it was
far from over. During their nine-game winning streak, the Pirates
had scored 72 runs and were batting .336 as a club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize I have to be focused the whole game,'' Johnson said.
``With a one-run game, the tying run is coming up every inning. It
made me stay focused. It's easy to go out there flat late in the
game. The next thing you know, a couple of guys get on base, a bad
pitch here and there, and it could have been a different ballgame.
Of all the games I've pitched for the Astros, I really felt the
most comfortable than any other I've pitched.''

   After three straight home shutouts, who can tell?

RAFTER GETS ANOTHER SHOT AT RUSEDSKI IN HAMLET SEMIS 
</HEADLINE>

 By RON DICKER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COMMACK, N.Y. _ Even Mother Nature seems to be a Patrick Rafter
fan. The clouds coalesced into an ominous charcoal smudge at
twilight during his quarterfinal match against Nicolas Escude in
the Hamlet Cup Friday night.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the rain held off to give Rafter the 54 minutes he needed to
swat away Escude, 6-3, 6-2, and reach Saturday's semifinal against
Greg Rusedski. Rafter beat Rusedski in last year's U.S. Open final
and holds a 4-1 edge over him. He also has the more laid-back
approach to their sixth encounter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not putting too much into it,'' Rafter said. ``I'm trying
to reserve my energy, trying to relax out there.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The fourth-seeded Rusedski, after his 6-2, 6-3 victory over
Daniel Vacek of the Czech Republic Friday afternoon, said he would
use the semifinal to determine where his game is before the Open.
But Rusedski is coming from a pretty good place, having reached the
quarterfinals and semifinals in his first two tournaments back
since tearing a tendon in his right ankle. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Escude, a Frenchman ranked 40th, complained Friday night that
Rafter's serve and volley charge left him few opportunities to
counter-attack. Rafter surrendered only nine points on his serve
and won 64 percent of the points. The approaching remnants of
Hurricane Bonnie were a greater threat to him than Escude. Looking
skyward between points, Rafter accelerated his pace to beat the
storm.
</P>
<P>
   The deluge began during the doubles match between between Luke
and Murphy Jensen and Eric Taino and Greg Van Emburgh. In the other
semifinal, eighth seeded Felix Mantilla of Spain will meet Marat
Safin of Russia. Mantilla ousted Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil, 6-4,
2-6, 6-4. The 18-year-old Safin beat David Prinosil of Germany,
6-1, 7-6 (7-2). &QL;

ON PRO FOOTBALL: PARCELLS HAS A VISION FOR JETS, BUT JUST WHAT IS
IT? 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Hang around Bill Parcells long enough, and you will
hear him grumble and grunt, ``I go by what I see.''
</P>
<P>
   He says that meaning: Others see this, I see that. You see a Pro
Bowl player, I see a stiff. You see a quarterback, I see a quitter.
You see a defense, I see jokers. You see a leader, I see a louse.
You see a dynamic back, I see a fat, lazy cat. You see heart, I see
fear.
</P>
<P>
   You see losers, I see champions.
</P>
<P>
   Well, let's see. Parcells had that initial 9-7 season as the
Jets' head coach, and now he has had this spring and summer _ the
draft, minicamps, training camp and the preseason _ to continue
fashioning the Jets in his image.
</P>
<P>
   The preseason is over now, after a solid Jets showing Friday
night in a 24-7 victory against a very shaky Chicago team. The
Bears are no longer monsters, but they are scary. They fell behind
the Jets 10-0 in the first quarter and looked out of step, out of
this league and headed for big trouble. The Bears looked like the
Jets did only two seasons ago when they were 1-15. Last season the
Bears were 4-12. This year they won't even win four.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, it is tough to gauge where the Jets stand as they prepare
for the opener next Sunday in San Francisco. Going from the Bears
to the 49ers is like trying to put a leash on a cat and then one on
an alligator. The 49ers are not easily collared. Especially at
home.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells always talks about what he does not have and rarely
about what he does have. He picks favorites. Fullback Jerald Sowell
(``I'm rooting for him'') is one of his guys. Cornerback Aaron
Glenn (``He hasn't been playing well, and he knows it'') is a
player Parcells rides.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells plays these mind games. Sometimes they are ridiculous,
and other times they are so effective and convincing that even
Parcells is duped. His games become reality, and then fiction does,
too. Some players overachieve. Others fall apart. It's a crash and
burn, a mix and match that has served him well, and he has two
Super Bowl rings to prove that.
</P>
<P>
   Mix and match.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Jets. It is a team with so many elements, but none
of them are overwhelming. A team that can move the ball on offense
and give it right back on defense. A team with special teams that
can make plays. A team with size and with apparent staying power. A
team needing more speed. A team that has enough on-field leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Three players are key to the Jets' season. And I'm going by what
I see.
</P>
<P>
   _ Glenn Foley: He has survived his identity crisis. He survived
Vinny Testaverde's making one start and the controversy that
swirled around that. Foley sometimes throws it long when he should
be dumping it short. And vice versa. What young quarterback does
not? The more he plays, the better he gets. Parcells has called him
a fireman. The Jets need him to fan the flames. He is a better
quarterback on the move. The Jets must develop that part of his
game with proper play-calling.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jerald Sowell: Everyone makes a big deal out of the newcomer
Curtis Martin. It is a big deal. But Sowell could also prove to be
a big a deal. He is certainly bigger. Much bigger. Martin is 5 feet
11 inches, 210 pounds; Sowell is 6 feet, 248 pounds. Of course,
Martin is the tailback and Sowell is the fullback.
</P>
<P>
   But what is exciting about Sowell is that he shows wonderful
nimbleness for his size and he can catch the ball. He caught one
over his shoulder against the Bears, a lob job that showed
concentration and agility, that gained 28 yards and helped set up a
touchdown. A fullback who can catch the ball downfield? That is a
weapon tough for anyone to defend.
</P>
<P>
   _ Aaron Glenn: He has been a Pro Bowl cornerback and a terrific
kick returner, but his performance in camp has been spotty, and now
he must enter the season a bit unsure of himself. Talented, no
doubt, once wonderfully spirited, but the question is if Parcells
is pushing the right buttons to help the guy reach his peak.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn was not happy with the grind of training camp. Few
veterans are. But his spark is missing, and the Jets need it. In
today's National Football League, your top cornerback matches up
with the marquee receiver and travels with him all day. When you
have a corner who can do this, your entire defense is versatile.
Maybe all Glenn needs to get motivated is for the regular season to
start. The real games. Let's see: the last time we saw something
like this, it was running back Adrian Murrell. He hit a slump.
Parcells tried to mix praise with punches to get him back. Murrell
fumbled more. He cried over it. He is gone.
</P>
<P>
   The place-kicking battle is curious. John Hall is the incumbent
with so much talent, but Parcells sees holes. Brett Conway is the
new guy, and he looked decent against the Bears. He even made a
touchdown-saving tackle on a kickoff return.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets look ready for an interesting game with the 49ers, but
they are not ready for a victory. No matter. They will win enough.
If Parcells pushes the right buttons, they will win 11 games this
season.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder if Parcells sees that?
</P>
<P>
   I do.

JENKINS TO START UA'S OPENER  
 BUT TOMEY INSISTS QB JOB UP FOR GRABS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ Arizona says it doesn't have a quarterback controversy,
but it does have an early leader in the race between Ortege Jenkins
and Keith Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins will take the first snap in Arizona's 1998 season opener
Thursday night at Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   He'll be No. 1 on the depth chart. He'll be introduced to the
crowd at Aloha Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But the starting job is still vacant. For now, Jenkins is the
leading candidate. But a candidate, nonetheless. Think of next
Thursday as the primary in an election. The polls favor Jenkins,
but Smith still has a very good chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``O.J. is going to start the game, but that doesn't mean he's
the starting quarterback,'' Arizona Coach Dick Tomey said. ``These
guys understand that they're both going to get their opportunities
during the first few weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomey made the decision to start Jenkins after practice Thursday
night. In part, his decision gives both quarterbacks a better idea
of what to expect and how to prepare. It also quieted a lot of
speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just been so much talk going around Tucson about this
whole thing,'' Smith, a 5-foot-11 redshirt junior, said Friday
during a break between classes. ``It's just nice to clear the air
about it for now. Let's just get this step out in the open and move
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, it really doesn't matter to me one way or the other.
At least this way, I'll get a chance to watch O.J. work against
Hawaii's defense. Then, I should be better prepared when I get my
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear how Tomey plans to rotate Jenkins and Smith. The
Wildcats could begin the game by using Jenkins in the first quarter
and Smith in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, however, that the division of playing time will be
dictated by the game's circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins, a 6-2 redshirt sophomore, was unavailable for comment
Friday at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it seems safe to assume that he was pleased by
Tomey's decision. At times, Jenkins has been outspoken about his
desire to start.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins appears to have an edge over Smith as the Wildcats, No.
24 in the Associated Press' preseason poll, put the final touches
on their preparations for the season opener.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins was the starter at the end of last season when the
Wildcats won their final four games. However, Tomey was never
reluctant to go to Smith if Jenkins struggled, as he did in a
double-overtime victory at California.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins also appeared to be more effective during a scrimmage
nine days ago at Arizona Stadium. There were moments when his
cannon-like arm and drop-back, pro style looked like a good fit for
a dynamically-skilled receiving corps led by Jeremy McDaniel and
Dennis Northcutt.
</P>
<P>
   ``O.J. was slightly better than Keith in the scrimmage,'' Tomey
said. ``Not by much. But on the basis of that and the way he
finished last year, we'll go with O.J. in the beginning.'' &QL;

WORN GRASS RARELY BOTHERS D-BACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although the experiment of using natural grass inside a domed
stadium has been a success, the turf at Bank One Ballpark is
showing a lot of wear as the season winds down.
</P>
<P>
   Several areas are worn _ the cutout areas of the bases, in front
of home plate and where the outfielders stand. But no one seems to
be complaining, least of all the infielders, who would seem to be
affected most.
</P>
<P>
   ``All things considered, it's been terrific,'' shortstop Jay
Bell said, complimenting the work of head groundskeeper Grant
Trenbeath and his crew. ``When you have any natural field, even if
it's the best you've ever seen, you're sometimes gonna get a hop
that's not a true hop.''
</P>
<P>
   The area around third base appears particularly worn, and Matt
Williams acknowledged it has had some effect. Some grounders have
taken unusual hops, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult because a lot of third basemen play in for the
bunt, and they're chewing that area up,'' he said. ``Grant has
replaced it, but it takes time for it to take. He's done a great
job with the field.'' &QL;  &QL; 
Headaches &QL;  &QL; 
Outfielder Bernard Gilkey, who came to the Diamondbacks from the
New York Mets just before the trading deadline expired July 31,
occasionally suffers from migraines. He was hit with one before
Thursday's game but played anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Gilkey said migraines have struck during games once or twice in
his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had them all my life,'' he said. ``You just have to deal
with it. You have to catch it when you can, before it can come
back. You get signs. You get warnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilkey had a headache of another sort Thursday when some of the
fans in the left-field seats booed him, apparently for not diving
for a ball. Gilkey has replaced fan favorite David Dellucci in
left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really pay them much much attention,'' said Gilkey,
who experienced the uniqueness of playing in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fans are fans anywhere you go. They're gonna be critical.''
</P>
<P>
   The boos turned to cheers Friday when Gilkey threw out Fernando
Vina, who tried to stretch a single into a double. Gilkey also got
two hits in the Diamondbacks' 6-3 victory over Milwaukee. &QL;  &QL; 
Balks and walks &QL;  &QL; 
Diamondbacks pitcher Brian Anderson, who got his 10th win,
committed his fifth balk, tops in the majors. Hideo Nomo of the New
York Mets has four. On the other hand, Anderson has picked off 10
base runners. And with no walks in seven innings, he tied Rick Reed
of the Mets and David Wells of the New York Yankees for fewest
walks per nine innings at 1.2. &QL;  &QL; 
Short stops &QL;  &QL; 
Vina, who led the Pac-10 in batting while playing for Arizona State
in 1990, extended his hitting streak to 12 games with a
first-inning single. Vina was the Brewers' only All-Star
representative this season.
</P>
<P>
   When he played center field in Thursday's game, Andy Fox became
just the second player in the majors this season to start at six
different positions. Anaheim's Craig Shipley is the other. Fox has
started in left, center and right fields, plus first, second and
third base.
</P>
<P>
   Devon White's solo home run in the first inning marked the first
time since his first full season in the majors that he has hit at
least 20 homers in a season. White hit 24 with the California
Angels in 1987. &QL;  &QL;

ON A FAMILIAR STAGE, PIAZZA PLAYS THE HERO 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mike Piazza had to feel at home Friday night.
There were boos for the All-Star catcher every time he stepped up
to bat. And then there were cheers to meet the jeers.
</P>
<P>
   There was a pre-game hug from Tommy Lasorda (who hugged Hideo
Nomo, too). There was even a standing ovation from a rare sellout
crowd of 52,154 after Piazza lined a menacing sixth-inning home run
over the left-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   But for the rest of the New York Mets, it looked as if there
would just be mounting frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Until, that is, John Olerud launched reliever Scott Radinsky's
third pitch into the right-field pavilion for a two-out, game-tying
three-run home run in the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   And then Piazza, in his Los Angeles homecoming, keyed the
winning rally with a bloop single off Los Angeles closer Jeff Shaw
to open the top of the 10th as the Mets rallied from what looked
like another demoralizing defeat for a 5-4 victory over the Dodgers
in 10 innings.
</P>
<P>
   With the victory, the Mets (74-61) avoided falling out of the
National League wild-card lead for the first time in 11 days.
Instead, the Mets were able to stay even with the Cubs, who won
10-5 in Colorado Friday evening, in the postseason chase.
</P>
<P>
   After his bloop single over shortstop opened the 10th, Piazza
took second on a four-pitch walk to Brian McRae, then survived a
pickoff attempt that hit him on his right side.
</P>
<P>
   Lenny Harris' sacrifice moved Piazza to third. Then, after an
intentional walk and with the infield in, Piazza put the Mets ahead
on Rey Ordonez's bouncer to first, as Eric Karros' throw pulled
Charles Johnson off the plate, up the third-base line, and Piazza
slid under the tag.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a two-base throwing error by Edgardo Alfonzo, and then
an infield hit off his glove that loaded the bases with one out,
John Franco pitched a scoreless 10th for his 29th save to make a
winner out of Dennis Cook (8-4), who threw a whopping 48 pitches in
two tenuous innings of relief.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Jones, the Mets' starter, surrendered 11 hits in five-plus
innings. Gary Sheffield hit a three-run home run in the first
inning, and Karros delivered a two-out, solo shot in the fifth.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was Piazza's first visit to Dodger Stadium since he was
traded from Los Angeles to Florida on May 15. Regardless of the
result, it had to be a bittersweet homecoming for Piazza, who was
acquired by the Mets on May 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know his heart is still here,'' Lasorda, Piazza's first
manager in Los Angeles and now the Dodgers' interim general
manager, said before the game.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever his heart is, Piazza's condominium is still in nearby
Manhattan Beach. And it was obvious he felt comfortable in his
surroundings Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty much the same as it always was, which is great for
me,'' Piazza said before the game as a throng of cameras and
microphones recorded his every move.

PIAZZA HAS FINISHING TOUCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE PIAZZA  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The house was packed for Mike Piazza's homecoming and whether
they booed or cheered, the fans watched a classic.
</P>
<P>
   With a chance to see the Dodgers one-time brightest star as a
New York Met, a crowd of 52,154 came to Dodger Stadium on Friday
night. They were disappointed only by the final score.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Mets ended the Dodgers chances of their first
four-game winning streak with a 5-4 victory in 10 innings, Piazza
had the kind of night that had fans wishing he had taken that
six-year, $85 million the club offered four months ago.
</P>
<P>
   He hit a home run in the sixth inning, then scored the winning
run in the 10th after getting struck in the right side by a wild
pickoff throw from Jeff Shaw (3-7), the Dodgers third pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Two batters later, Piazza raced home when first baseman Eric
Karros fielded Matt Franco's bases-loaded grounder but threw wildly
to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a perfect night for Mike,'' Mets manager Bobby
Valentine said. ``He didn't go 5 for 5 with six RBI, but he showed
the kind of player that he's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the same Franco from Westlake High whose ninth-inning
homer off Shaw on Aug. 1 tied a game the Mets later won.
</P>
<P>
   Their victory Friday wasn't finished until Mets' closer John
Franco wiggled out of a bases-loaded, one out situation.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza's homer, his fifth in eight games and 26th overall,
seemed meaningless in the sixth. But when John Olerud, the National
League's leading hitter, added a three-tun homer in the seventh,
the game was tied.
</P>
<P>
   Other than Karros, who also hit a home run, Piazza wasn't
exactly facing the old gang. Only Karros, Eric Young and Raul
Mondesi remain from the club's opening day lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield, one of the major components in the May 15 trade
that sent Piazza to the Florida Marlins, hit a three-run homer in
the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, who remain tied with the Chicago Cubs for a National
League wild-card berth, lead the Dodgers (67-68) by seven games
with 27 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Carlos Perez, in search of his first victory as a
Dodger, limited the Mets to Piazza's home run through six innings.
But Perez allowed a single and a walk and two sharp liners before
Dodgers manager Glenn Hoffman went with Scott Radinsky to face
Olerud.
</P>
<P>
   On the first pitch, Olerud turned on a fastball and drove it
into the right-field stands for his 18th homer.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza received a warm ovation during pre-game warmups, but his
former teammates really got the place rocking by scoring three runs
in the bottom of the first against Mets' right-hander Bobby Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Young and Trenidad Hubbard opened with singles and
Sheffield drove a 1-0 fastball over the center-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   For Sheffield, it was his 22nd homer. It also gave him four hits
in 10 at-bats with six RBI since moving from cleanup to third in
the order.
</P>
<P>
   Until the seventh it looked like it might be enough.
</P>
<P>
   They added a run in the fifth when Karros homered for the second
night in a row. Karros now has 20 homers and 78 RBI and now is well
within range of his fourth consecutive 100 RBI season.
</P>
<P>
   But despite big night's for the big names, Perez was not outdone
by anyone. Even when he turned the game over to Radinsky, it looked
like he might get his first Dodgers victory.
</P>
<P>
   He entered the game winless in his first five Dodgers starts and
still experiencing some discomfort in his non-throwing shoulder
from an auto accident July 20, one week before coming over in a
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, 7-13 coming in, stirred the crowd when he grabbed a sharp
grounder by Olerud and started a double play to end the third.
</P>
<P>
   He then faced Piazza to open the fourth and caught a vicious
liner back to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Perez was lucky to be in one piece, but he broke into a wide
grin and danced off the mound.
</P>
<P>
   The next time Perez faced Piazza led off the sixth. This time,
Piazza came out on top, driving Perez's first pitch into the
left-field stands.
</P>
<P>
   For Piazza, who still has not won over the New York fans, it was
his fifth homer and 11th RBI in eight games. But it was much more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The night was very emotional,'' Piazza said. ``When we played
the Dodgers in New York it didn't really hit me. You can't play
somewhere five years and not be affected.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez has struggled with his control since joining the Dodgers.
He walked four on Friday, including leadoff hitter Tony Phillips
three times. But until Phillips scored on Olerud's homer, the walks
hadn't hurt.

   Two batters later, Piazza raced home when first baseman Eric
Karros fielded Matt Franco's bases-loaded grounder but threw wildly
to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a perfect night for Mike,'' Mets manager Bobby
Valentine said. ``He didn't go 5 for 5 with six RBI, but he showed
the kind of player that he's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the same Franco from Westlake High whose ninth-inning
homer off Shaw on Aug. 1 tied a game the Mets later won.
</P>
<P>
   Their victory Friday wasn't finished until Mets' closer John
Franco wiggled out of a bases-loaded, one out situation.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza's homer, his fifth in eight games and 26th overall,
seemed meaningless in the sixth. But when John Olerud, the National
League's leading hitter, added a three-tun homer in the seventh,
the game was tied.
</P>
<P>
   Other than Karros, who also hit a home run, Piazza wasn't
exactly facing the old gang. Only Karros, Eric Young and Raul
Mondesi remain from the club's opening day lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield, one of the major components in the May 15 trade
that sent Piazza to the Florida Marlins, hit a three-run homer in
the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, who remain tied with the Chicago Cubs for a National
League wild-card berth, lead the Dodgers (67-68) by seven games
with 27 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Carlos Perez, in search of his first victory as a
Dodger, limited the Mets to Piazza's home run through six innings.
But Perez allowed a single and a walk and two sharp liners before
Dodgers manager Glenn Hoffman went with Scott Radinsky to face
Olerud.
</P>
<P>
   On the first pitch, Olerud turned on a fastball and drove it
into the right-field stands for his 18th homer.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza received a warm ovation during pre-game warmups, but his
former teammates really got the place rocking by scoring three runs
in the bottom of the first against Mets' right-hander Bobby Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Young and Trenidad Hubbard opened with singles and
Sheffield drove a 1-0 fastball over the center-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   For Sheffield, it was his 22nd homer. It also gave him four hits
in 10 at-bats with six RBI since moving from cleanup to third in
the order.
</P>
<P>
   Until the seventh it looked like it might be enough.
</P>
<P>
   They added a run in the fifth when Karros homered for the second
night in a row. Karros now has 20 homers and 78 RBI and now is well
within range of his fourth consecutive 100 RBI season.
</P>
<P>
   But despite big night's for the big names, Perez was not outdone
by anyone. Even when he turned the game over to Radinsky, it looked
like he might get his first Dodgers victory.
</P>
<P>
   He entered the game winless in his first five Dodgers starts and
still experiencing some discomfort in his non-throwing shoulder
from an auto accident July 20, one week before coming over in a
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, 7-13 coming in, stirred the crowd when he grabbed a sharp
grounder by Olerud and started a double play to end the third.
</P>
<P>
   He then faced Piazza to open the fourth and caught a vicious
liner back to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Perez was lucky to be in one piece, but he broke into a wide
grin and danced off the mound.
</P>
<P>
   The next time Perez faced Piazza led off the sixth. This time,
Piazza came out on top, driving Perez's first pitch into the
left-field stands.
</P>
<P>
   For Piazza, who still has not won over the New York fans, it was
his fifth homer and 11th RBI in eight games. But it was much more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The night was very emotional,'' Piazza said. ``When we played
the Dodgers in New York it didn't really hit me. You can't play
somewhere five years and not be affected.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez has struggled with his control since joining the Dodgers.
He walked four on Friday, including leadoff hitter Tony Phillips
three times. But until Phillips scored on Olerud's homer, the walks
hadn't hurt.

PIAZZA HAS FINISHING TOUCH
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The house was packed for Mike Piazza's homecoming and whether
they booed or cheered, the fans watched a classic.
</P>
<P>
   With a chance to see the Dodgers one-time brightest star as a
New York Met, a crowd of 52,154 came to Dodger Stadium on Friday
night. They were disappointed only by the final score.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Mets ended the Dodgers chances of their first
four-game winning streak with a 5-4 victory in 10 innings, Piazza
had the kind of night that had fans wishing he had taken that
six-year, $85 million the club offered four months ago.
</P>
<P>
   He hit a home run in the sixth inning, then scored the winning
run in the 10th after getting struck in the right side by a wild
pickoff throw from Jeff Shaw (3-7), the Dodgers third pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Two batters later, Piazza raced home when first baseman Eric
Karros fielded Matt Franco's bases-loaded grounder but threw wildly
to the plate.

END OF PRESEASON PROVIDES SEAHAWK FANS SOME ANSWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Fake football is over _ can I have an amen, brothers
and sisters? Thankew _ but here is the real deal: All the answers
to your Seahawk preseason questions.
</P>
<P>
   If your question wasn't used, it's because it wasn't on sale at
the Seahawk store for $89.95.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why did the Seahawks play five exhibition games instead of
four?
</P>
<P>
   A: As with all things Paul Allen, his football club is on the
cutting edge, having done this two years in a row. The NFL plans to
gradually increase the number of fake games to eight, 10, 12 and
eventually create a year-round sport. Noting a Kingdome maybe
three-quarters full of people who eschewed one of the great Friday
evenings in Seattle history to watch Friday night's tricked-up
scrimmage, the NFL and its running-dog lackeys, the TV networks,
understand it is impossible to underestimate the gullibility of the
American sports public.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So if they put helmets on armadillos, surrounded them with
jiggle, and called it NFL football, people would show up?
</P>
<P>
   A: Shhh.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Aren't all these meaningless games hard on players?
</P>
<P>
   A: The only known record of the NFL caring about players over
money was lost in a small house fire during the War of 1812.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who was the sputtering twit that came up with the Seahawks'
new slogan, ``Alive and Kicking''?
</P>
<P>
   A: Someone who never saw the Seahawk special teams last year.
Invoking the word ``kick'' to try to sell the Seahawks is like
trying to elect Bill Clinton on a campaign of family values.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why did quarterback Warren Moon, without a hint of leverage,
stay out of training camp in a contract squabble?
</P>
<P>
   A. Have you ever been to Cheney?
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever been to a football training camp?
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever been 41?
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't, here's a hint _ they don't go together very
well.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So how did Moon look Friday night?
</P>
<P>
   A: Coulda used a little training camp. He was 7-for-10 passing
for 100 yards, including a 43-yard beaut to Joey Galloway, but he
was brutalized by three 49er rushers in what became a 21-yard sack,
including a fumble. If anything is to be learned in Cheney, it's
how to get the hellouttathere.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who's the biggest Seahawk surprise?
</P>
<P>
   A: Ahman Green, a third-round pick from Nebraska, is the fastest
running back in Seahawk history. Besides a 6-yard TD run and a
two-point conversion Friday, Green rushed SF punter Tommy Thompson
so hard he was forced to pull the ball back before he even swung
his leg.
</P>
<P>
   If Green can just return Mariner third baseman Russ Davis' glove
_ five preseason fumbles _ the Seahawks may have the best thing
from Nebraska since ... well, whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Any hints yet who might be the dumbest Seahawk player?
</P>
<P>
   A: My early vote goes to cornerback Fred Thomas, who after a
good first-quarter tackle made the always socially redeeming
throat-slitting gesture. He also was lit up in the end zone for
both 49er touchdowns in the first half and had a 15-yard face mask
penalty tackling the punter on a run.
</P>
<P>
   He took the dim-bulb lead in the pretend season two weeks ago
when he blasted a 49er punt returner before he caught the ball.
Time for the NFL to consider SAT scores as a job qualification.
</P>
<P>
   Q: As a big fan of hydroplane racing, were there any spectacular
injuries?
</P>
<P>
   A: Early in the third quarter, Seahawk safety Kerry Joseph
whacked 49er passcatcher Mark Harris into a three-minute nap on the
Kingdome rug. Harris left the game with a concussion, but there
were no lost limbs or protruding bones of the hydro variety.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How is it the Seahawks can look respectable against San
Francisco?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Seahawks are absolute beasts against the 49ers when the
game means nothing. You may recall that in the last game of the
1997 regular season, the 49ers already had locked up a playoff spot
when they came fetally curled to the Kingdome, where the Seahawks
won, 38-9. Should these teams ever play a meaningful game, the guys
in blue figure to assume the position.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How's Cortez Kennedy doing?
</P>
<P>
   A: Friday night, he was as mobile as the street sign bearing his
name in his little Arkansas hometown. His sprained ankle kept him
from suiting up. If it doesn't get better soon, they might have to
change the street name to Highway 96.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What happens if the Seahawks, in the face of another year of
high expectations, lay another putrid egg in the season opener like
they did last year against the Jets?
</P>
<P>
   A: Borrowing a page from the Mike Ditka training camp, the
coaching staff will be forced to run a gauntlet of Seahawk
executives, led by president Bob Whitsitt, all wielding coins
wrapped in socks. I don't think I need to remind you how many coins
Paul Allen has.

YANKEES SPOIL PINIELLA'S PARTY IN FIRST INNING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Even Yogi Berra would have been hard pressed to say
Friday night's game between the Mariners and New York Yankees
wasn't over until it was over.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the doubt was erased in the first inning when the
Yankees sent 10 batters to the plate, scored five runs and coasted
to a 10-3 victory before 49,789 fans at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners, losing for the third time in four games on this
rugged road trip through the East Coast, had three bright spots.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Monahan, Russ Davis, and Rob Ducey homered.
</P>
<P>
   The only good any of them did was to enable the Mariners to
become the first team in major league history to hit at least 200
home runs in three consecutive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   So much for manager Lou Piniella's 55th birthday bash. Still a
favorite here because he helped the Yankees win two world
championships as a player, Piniella was saluted on the big screen
between the top and bottom of the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The candles had already been blown out.
</P>
<P>
   Left-handed starter Paul Spoljaric, who had shown improvement in
each of his starts since replacing Randy Johnson, learned
first-hand why the Yankees are on their way to perhaps becoming the
winningest team in major league history.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch greeted him with a double, Chili Davis and Jorge
Posada also doubled in the first-inning getaway as New York batted
around for the 29th time this season en route to their 97th win.
</P>
<P>
   They are 61 games over .500.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners have won 61 games this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we take a lead like that, it's very tough for anyone to
come back and beat us,'' said Luis Sojo. ``This obviously is a very
confident team. We come to the park every day knowing we're going
to win, we just don't know the score.''
</P>
<P>
   For those keeping track, the Yankees are 51-12 at home and need
only 20 wins in their final 29 games to win a record-setting 117
games.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners, at least, won't lose 117.
</P>
<P>
   ``They jumped on us early and sort of took us out of it,''
Piniella said. ``Spoljaric was up with everything, his breaking
balls, off-speed pitches, fastballs. He never got into rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   But Spoljaric saw it differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't up at all,'' he said. ``They hit a lot of good
pitches, they didn't miss too many balls. It was not my night.''
</P>
<P>
   A good night at Yankees Stadium is a rarity for Spoljaric.
</P>
<P>
   He has now pitched 52/3 innings in Yankees Stadium allowing 15
runs, a 25.41 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I haven't pitched well here, but that has nothing to do
with (Friday night),'' Spoljaric said.
</P>
<P>
   Spoljaric, now 4-3, said the only pitch he wanted back in the
first inning was the 0-2 fastball Davis rammed into right-center
field for a two run double that put New York in front 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than that, I felt I threw good pitches. I thought I had
good stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankees starter Osvaldo Hernandez was the opposite of Spoljaric.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander issued a lead-off single to Joey Cora, who
stole second, to start the game then proceeded to strike out Alex
Rodriguez, Ken Griffey Jr., and David Segui.
</P>
<P>
   Only three other Mariners reached second base off Hernandez, and
two were just passing through.
</P>
<P>
   Monahan hit his third homer in the third and Davis lead off the
seventh inning with this 19th.
</P>
<P>
   Ducey went deep for the fifth time this season in the ninth off
Yankee reliever Jay Tessmer. The blast into the right field
bleachers became a footnote in baseball history _ Seattle's 200th
of the season. They set a major league record last season with 264
and had 245 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Rodriguez, who has 37, nor Griffey, with 44, came close.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, bidding to become the third player in major league
history to hit at least 40 homers and steal 40 bases in a single
season, struck out twice in three at bats while playing five
innings. Griffey also went 0 for 3 with a walk as the designated
hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella decided to rest right-handed hitters Edgar Martinez and
Jay Buhner against the right-handed Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw the ball good for five or six innings,'' Piniella
said of Hernandez, now 9-4. ``He knows how to pitch, no question.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch went 4-for-5 and scored two runs for the Yankees, who
had six extra base hits among their 12 hits off four Mariner
pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact every Yankee starter, which didn't include ex-Mariner
first baseman Tino Martinez and Paul O'Neill, given the night off
against the left handed Spoljaric, had at least one hit. New York's
longest base hit was an upper deck two-run homer by Scott Brosius
off of Spoljaric in the third inning, pumping New York's advantage
to 7-1.

FRIESZ'S LATE HEROICS LEAD SEAHAWKS PAST 49ERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It is called the two-minute drill. Friday night, John
Friesz needed less than 90 seconds to complete it.
</P>
<P>
   Friesz's 2-yard TD pass to rookie wide receiver Bobby Shaw with
29 seconds remaining gave the Seahawks a wild 21-20 preseason
victory over the San Francisco 49ers at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like we could get the score the entire time,'' Friesz
said after completing 7 of 9 passes in directing the 89-yard drive
to the game-winning score. ``The 49ers made it easier for us
because they didn't match up with our three-receiver sets. For most
of the second half, they played a base 4-3 defense even when we
went with three receivers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks were trailing 20-14 when Friesz got the ball at the
Seattle 11-yard line. Each play on the drive was big, but the
biggest were his completions of 18 yards to Robert Wilson on
third-and-11, 20 yards to Shaw to the 49ers' 27-yard line, 25 yards
to Ronnie Harris and, of course, the TD pass to Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just tried to get in position to make a play,'' Shaw said.
``John did a great job of getting me the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a big drive for the Seahawks, who matched a club-best by
finishing the preseason 4-1. It was an even bigger drive for
Friesz, who is battling Jon Kitna to be the backup to Warren Moon
when the Seahawks open the regular season in Philadelphia next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dennis Erickson said he won't decide whether Friesz or
Kitna will be No. 2 until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks needed Friesz's late heroics because Wade Richey, a
rookie free agent who was released by the Seahawks on Monday and
claimed two days later by the 49ers, kicked two second-half field
goals to give the 49ers a 20-14 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Richey's 45-yarder with 1:02 left in the third quarter broke a
14-14 tie, and he added a 53-yarder with 5:25 left in the game. He
also attempted a 62-yarder with 2 seconds left, but it fell 5 yards
short.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson has been an outspoken opponent of playing five
preseason games, and for too much of Friday night his players
performed as if they too were looking ahead to next week's opener
in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   They missed too many tackles and didn't make enough big plays on
offense _ especially the No. 2 units, which inherited a 6-0 lead
only to be outscored 20-8 before Friesz's game-saver. Cornerback
Fred Thomas gave up two second-quarter TD passes _ a 12-yarder to
Mark Harris and a 15-yarder to Irv Smith.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few bright spots was the performance of the No. 1
defense. In three series, the Seahawk starters held the 49ers to 33
yards _ and 20 of that came on one pass play.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the 49ers played without Pro Bowl quarterback Steve
Young, who had smacked his passing hand against a helmet last week,
and All-Galaxy wide receiver Jerry Rice, who is still recovering
from having knee surgery twice last season.
</P>
<P>
   But the aggressiveness that had been missing from earlier games
was apparent Friday night, as Seahawk defenders swarmed to the ball
and make plays from sideline to sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had an attitude tonight,'' cornerback Shawn Springs said.
``We just played hard, we played fast and with an attitude of
whatever happens happens. We didn't worry about making mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the better examples of this new attitude followed Jim
Druckenmiller's 20-yard completion to a wide-open Smith at the
49ers' 45-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   On the next play, defensive tackle Sam Adams squirted through a
gap to almost drop 49er running back Garrison Hearst in the
backfield. Linebacker Chad Brown then strung out the play and
middle linebacker Dean Wells finished it by dropping Hearst for a
4-yard loss.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays later, on third-and-10, Druckenmiller passed to
Ihenayi Uwaezuoke as he ran across the field. But Thomas and
Springs flew in from opposite directions to stop Uwaezouke for a
1-yard gain and force a punt.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1 offense also played just three series, but had its
moments. Moon completed 7 of 10 passes for 100 yards in directing
drives to a pair of Todd Peterson field goals.
</P>
<P>
   On the first, Moon was 4 of 5 by taking the short routes the
49ers were giving him _ 12 yards to Ricky Watters out of the
backfield; 2 yards to fullback Mack Strong; 9 yards to wide
receiver Mike Pritchard; and 5 yards to wide receiver Joey
Galloway.
</P>
<P>
   On the second, Moon went deep twice, lofting a 43-yard
completion to Galloway over 49ers cornerback R.W. McQuarters and
then hitting Pritchard for 20 yards on third-and-13. But the drive
stalled when Moon's third-down pass went off the hand of Brian
Blades at the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the night, they were playing Joey soft. I was very
surprised then came up and pressured him on that play,'' Moon said
of the long completion to Galloway. ``I don't think they expected
us to go long that deep in our own territory.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks first TD came on a 6-yard run by Ahman Green in the
third quarter. The rookie running back had another strong outing,
carrying 10 times for 33 yards and catching two passes for 18
yards.
</P>
<P>
   HAWK TALK: The strangeness of Richey's week was not lost on the
rookie kicker. ``By Thursday, I was kicking in Santa Clara, and
then today I'm back here,'' he said. ``I have to think somebody up
there is looking out for me. And it was funny to be in the Kingdome
in a 49er uniform.'' ... Rookie LB DeShone Myles had another
productive outings, collecting 10 tackles. ... LB James Logan
started the game for Darrin Smith and had six solo tackles. Smith
did not play after cracking two ribs in last week's game at
Arizona.

BUCKS GET IN LINE FOR SKILES' ATTENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Scott Skiles summer tour may be adding yet another stop.
</P>
<P>
   Skiles, who joined the Suns as an assistant coach last season,
has been mentioned as a candidate for coaching jobs with the
Chicago Bulls, Sacramento Kings, Los Angeles Clippers and Denver
Nuggets, and now apparently is a candidate for the Milwaukee Bucks
job.
</P>
<P>
   Suns General Manager Bryan Colangelo said Friday that Skiles'
name has surfaced as a possible candidate for the Bucks, who fired
Chris Ford this week. Skiles interviewed for the Chicago job, and
the Kings have asked for permission to interview him.
</P>
<P>
   Reportedly, &QL; 
 &QL; 
the Clippers were to interview Skiles, but Colangelo said he has
not formally been asked by any teams other than Chicago and
Sacramento for permission to talk with Skiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to someone from the Clippers (Thursday) about
other things, and his name came up,'' Colangelo said. ``The
question was about my opinion of Skiles. They may have interest,
but there has been no formal indication of it. ``His name has come
up everywhere from Los Angeles to Milwaukee now. There seems to be
a short list of candidates out there. The three names that keep
coming up are Scott, Rick Carlisle and Kurt Rambis.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlisle is an Indiana assistant, and Rambis is a Lakers
assistant. Of the veteran coaches still out there, former Seattle
Coach George Karl tops the list. Former Chicago Coach Phil Jackson
also is without a job, although he may not be interested in working
this season. Former San Antonio Coach Bob Hill, who lobbied hard
for the Seattle job eventually won by Paul Westphal, also continues
to emerge as a possible candidate for the vacant jobs. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Back to Flag &QL; 
 &QL; 
After a one-year absence, the Suns will return their October
training camp to Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, if there
is a training camp in October.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns held camp in Phoenix last season, using America West
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said last year it was a one-year experiment,'' Colangelo
said. ``Last year, we had an established team with a lot of veteran
players. We might have a similar situation this year, but we don't
know yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo said Coach Danny Ainge wants the players in a more
remote location to build team chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   What if the current lockout goes into training camp or delays
the start of the season?
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no contingency plan for a rescheduled or relocated
training camp yet,'' Colangelo said. ``Obviously, anything we do
will at least have an out as far as our commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Proski on mend &QL; 
 &QL; 
Joe Proski, the dean of NBA trainers who has been with the Suns
since their inception in 1968, is recovering from serious back
surgery. He apparently experienced numbness in his legs while
attending an Arizona Diamondbacks game earlier in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo said Proski is doing well and will be back for his
32nd season with the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing great,'' Colangelo said. ``He was in the hospital
for a couple of weeks. He's still hobbling a little, but doing
well.''
</P>
<P>
   He must be feeling better. Through his career, Proski has had
more hairstyle and facial-hair changes than a member of the Federal
Witness Protection Program. And he's got another for the upcoming
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of an Anthony Hopkins look,'' Colangelo said. ``We
like it.'' &QL;

2 CRITICIZE SHOWDOWN FORMAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At least two National Hot Rod Association drivers aren't turning
cartwheels over next year's inaugural Winston Showdown format.
</P>
<P>
   Although a press release sent to the media quotes drivers John
Force and Kenny Bernstein favoring the all-star event, which
includes Top Fuel Dragsters squaring off against Funny Car drivers,
perhaps NHRA officials and series sponsor R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
Co., should have polled Whit Bazemore and Shelly Anderson instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I give an answer of what I really think, can they fire
me?'' Bazemore asked. ``I don't think they can. I've got a lot of
questions of how it can be equitable for the Top Fuelers and Funny
Cars. It's going to be really difficult to make it fair for both
classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know. We'll just have to wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson also expressed displeasure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like dragsters against dragsters and Funny Cars against
Funny Cars,'' said Anderson, who will return to the circuit next
week after sitting out two races because of burns she suffered to
her ankles and left wrist and arm in a crash last month at Sonoma,
Calif. ``I remember the Pro Comp days when my dad ran the alcohol
car and the dragsters ran against the Funny Cars. There definitely
seemed to be a disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't care for it. We're going to be giving people head
starts, and I don't like that.''
</P>
<P>
   But too many others do, including those whose opinions weigh far
more heavily than Bazemore or Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   An RJR spokesman said several surveys showed fans want to see
Top Fuelers go mano a mano against the Funny Cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The result was clear,'' RJR President Cliff Pennell said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some of their peers, Force and Bernstein welcome the
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Funny Car guys have always been considered the little
brothers in this sport,'' said Force, a seven-time NHRA Funny Car
champion. ``Well, it's time for us to step up and play with big
brother. This will really show the fans what it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson already has qualified for next year's 24-car field, but
more important, she is anxious to return to the starting grid after
her recent accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm only allowed to walk two hours a day for the next three
weeks, but I'm out of the wheelchair and the walker,'' Anderson
said. ``I'm lucky. I got a few burns. I had two sets of (skin
grafts) done to both ankles, my hand and my left arm. They're
healing, but it's been a lot slower than I thought. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad (team owner Brad Anderson) said if I wanted to sit out
that my sponsors, Parts America and Texaco, both said I could wait
until I was ready. But I've been pushing the doctor.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Sayonara &QL; 
 &QL; 
I don't know about you, but my rear end is going to be planted in
front of the television at 8 p.m. on Nov. 22. That's the date Dale
Earnhardt will face Dale Earnhardt Jr., on the racetrack for the
first time in their careers.
</P>
<P>
   Both drivers are entered in the NASCAR Thunder Special Coca-Cola
500 exhibition race in Japan, and don't believe for a second that
the Earnhardts won't be trying to beat each other to the finish
line.
</P>
<P>
   The Earnhardts each will be driving cars decked out with
Coca-Cola logos, and Valley-based Action Performance is creating an
array of exclusive Coca-Cola/Earnhardt apparel, souvenirs and other
memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   But the real action will be on the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one time I raced against my dad (Ralph Earnhardt) was at a
dirt track,'' the elder Earnhardt said. ``I was racing this guy,
and my dad, who was leading the race, came up behind me, and I
couldn't figure out what he was doing. Finally, he started bumping
me, so I figured I better hold the car straight. He pushed me by
this guy and I beat him. Then, dad drove on past me.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger Earnhardt is hoping he will have a car capable of
mixing it up with his famous father.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be really weird the first time I try to pass him on
the track, if I get a chance to pass him,'' Dale Jr. said. ``But
it's something that will be exciting for both of us, I'm sure.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Pit stops &QL; 
 &QL; 
Bob Glidden, NHRA's all-time winningest driver, is coming out of
retirement to compete in next week's U.S. Nationals.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Rahal on Monday will announce his replacement driver. &QL;

ATTRACTING NASCAR'S ELITE  
 AFTER HEARING CALLS OF BIG-NAME SUIT ORS, LEPAGE OPTS FOR ROUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just when Kevin Lepage was beginning to wonder if the telephone
would ever ring, it rang. And it didn't stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin, Dale Earnhardt here. I'm looking for someone to fill in
for my guy'' (injured driver Steve Park).
</P>
<P>
   Gulp.
</P>
<P>
   The phone rang again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin, this is Rick Hendrick.''
</P>
<P>
   And again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin, it's Richard Childress.''
</P>
<P>
   Then someone stuck a business card in Lepage's hand at a May 31
NASCAR Winston Cup race at Dover, Del.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the back of it, there was a note,'' Lepage said. ``It said,
`Call me Monday morning. Urgent.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The business card belonged to Roush Racing.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks later, Lepage, a series rookie, met with car owner
Jack Roush and Roush Racing President Geoff Smith, whose five-car
stable includes Mark Martin and Jeff Burton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, the question was, `Do you want to drive for Jack
Roush?' '' Lepage said. ``And (they) wanted a yes or no answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than four hours later, Lepage answered yes.
</P>
<P>
   Lepage's head still hasn't stopped spinning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very surprising,'' Lepage said in reference to all the
inquiries regarding his availability.
</P>
<P>
   Lepage, however, also realized he may have opened some eyes
after taking an unsponsored car owned by Joe Falk and consistently
outqualifying and finishing better than some of the more
established teams on the NASCAR circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lepage was nearly floored when some of the sport's top
teams began calling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that some day, somebody within the racing
organization would look at us,'' Lepage said. ``I never thought it
would be Jack Roush or Rick Hendrick and John Hendrick or Richard
Childress.''
</P>
<P>
   Lepage officially replaced ousted Roush driver Ted Musgrave two
weeks ago at Michigan Speedway, finishing 17th. A 10th-place finish
last week at Bristol, Tenn., gave this particular Roush team its
first top-10 finish in 12 races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that Kevin had won a Busch race (two years ago), and I
knew he had done some good qualifying in the 91 car'' owned by
Falk, crew chief James Ince said. ``But as far as believing he was
the next Dale Earnhardt or Jeff Gordon, I didn't see that.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I saw was a guy who has a lot of talent, potential and
desire. It's that desire that's attracted a lot of people to
(Lepage). Everybody has the desire to want to win on Sunday, but
not everybody does the things you need to do during the week to
ensure you win on Sunday. Kevin seems determined to do that. He's
like a kid in a candy store right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Lepage, 36, has waited a long time to put his hand in the cookie
jar.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, he moved his family from Shelburne, Vt., to
North Carolina to help further his driving career. Lepage and his
wife, Donna, owned their NASCAR Busch car the first two years, but
when major sponsor Vermont Teddy Bear Co. left after the 1995
season, the Lepages were racing out of their own pockets.
</P>
<P>
   A good start in 1996 attracted car owner David Ridling, and
Lepage countered with an eighth-place finish in the final Busch
standings and his first career win.
</P>
<P>
   Falk was next with an offer, and when Lepage put the unsponsored
machine in a top-20 qualifying position in the season-opening
Daytona 500, he began to turn heads.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lepage admits he and his wife struggled with making a
final decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Earnhardt) wanted to know if I was interested in driving with
them,'' Lepage said. ``I told them I needed to think about it
because it was such a major decision for me to make at that time. I
knew when (Park) was done with therapy and everything, he would be
back in the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then John Hendrick wanted to know if I was interested in
driving a Hendrick car. What car was never told to me. I said,
`Sure.' I never heard back until Pocono after (Roush) had showed
interest in me. (Jeff Gordon crew chief Ray Evernham) pulled me
aside and said, `Hey, look. You need to call this guy at Hendrick
because they want to talk to you.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I'd already had a contract in hand from Jack, and I felt
at that time that Jack wanted an answer, and he didn't want me to
go on to Hendrick or Childress or the Caterpillar team (owned by
Buz McCall) and get all these contracts in hand and get my mind all
screwed up on figuring out what deal should be done or what money
was coming.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Lepages huddled and chose Roush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at Mark Martin, he's been here for 10 years or so, and
if I can do the job that Jack expects from me, I can retire here,''
Lepage said. ``That was our main goal.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are five teams here right now, and (Martin and Burton's
teams) are making the rest of us look bad,'' Ince said. ``But I
think Kevin has enabled us to show how strong this team really is.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a negative reflection on (Musgrave). He got us to
the point where we are now. He's a hell of a race-car driver. I've
got this deep fear, and I hope it happens, that Ted is going to go
out and make us look bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   But who will mind if Lepage continues to make Roush look good. &QL;

teams) are making the rest of us look bad,'' Ince said. ``But I
think Kevin has enabled us to show how strong this team really is.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a negative reflection on (Musgrave). He got us to
the point where we are now. He's a hell of a race-car driver. I've
got this deep fear, and I hope it happens, that Ted is going to go
out and make us look bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   But who will mind if Lepage continues to make Roush look good. &QL;

2 CRITICIZE SHOWDOWN FORMAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At least two National Hot Rod Association drivers aren't turning
cartwheels over next year's inaugural Winston Showdown format.
</P>
<P>
   Although a press release sent to the media quotes drivers John
Force and Kenny Bernstein favoring the all-star event, which
includes Top Fuel Dragsters squaring off against Funny Car drivers,
perhaps NHRA officials and series sponsor R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
Co., should have polled Whit Bazemore and Shelly Anderson instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I give an answer of what I really think, can they fire
me?'' Bazemore asked. ``I don't think they can. I've got a lot of
questions of how it can be equitable for the Top Fuelers and Funny
Cars. It's going to be really difficult to make it fair for both
classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know. We'll just have to wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson also expressed displeasure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like dragsters against dragsters and Funny Cars against
Funny Cars,'' said Anderson, who will return to the circuit next
week after sitting out two races because of burns she suffered to
her ankles and left wrist and arm in a crash last month at Sonoma,
Calif. ``I remember the Pro Comp days when my dad ran the alcohol
car and the dragsters ran against the Funny Cars. There definitely
seemed to be a disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't care for it. We're going to be giving people head
starts, and I don't like that.''
</P>
<P>
   But too many others do, including those whose opinions weigh far
more heavily than Bazemore or Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   An RJR spokesman said several surveys showed fans want to see
Top Fuelers go mano a mano against the Funny Cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The result was clear,'' RJR President Cliff Pennell said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some of their peers, Force and Bernstein welcome the
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Funny Car guys have always been considered the little
brothers in this sport,'' said Force, a seven-time NHRA Funny Car
champion. ``Well, it's time for us to step up and play with big
brother. This will really show the fans what it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson already has qualified for next year's 24-car field, but
more important, she is anxious to return to the starting grid after
her recent accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm only allowed to walk two hours a day for the next three
weeks, but I'm out of the wheelchair and the walker,'' Anderson
said. ``I'm lucky. I got a few burns. I had two sets of (skin
grafts) done to both ankles, my hand and my left arm. They're
healing, but it's been a lot slower than I thought. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad (team owner Brad Anderson) said if I wanted to sit out
that my sponsors, Parts America and Texaco, both said I could wait
until I was ready. But I've been pushing the doctor.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Sayonara &QL; 
 &QL; 
I don't know about you, but my rear end is going to be planted in
front of the television at 8 p.m. on Nov. 22. That's the date Dale
Earnhardt will face Dale Earnhardt Jr., on the racetrack for the
first time in their careers.
</P>
<P>
   Both drivers are entered in the NASCAR Thunder Special Coca-Cola
500 exhibition race in Japan, and don't believe for a second that
the Earnhardts won't be trying to beat each other to the finish
line.
</P>
<P>
   The Earnhardts each will be driving cars decked out with
Coca-Cola logos, and Valley-based Action Performance is creating an
array of exclusive Coca-Cola/Earnhardt apparel, souvenirs and other
memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   But the real action will be on the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one time I raced against my dad (Ralph Earnhardt) was at a
dirt track,'' the elder Earnhardt said. ``I was racing this guy,
and my dad, who was leading the race, came up behind me, and I
couldn't figure out what he was doing. Finally, he started bumping
me, so I figured I better hold the car straight. He pushed me by
this guy and I beat him. Then, dad drove on past me.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger Earnhardt is hoping he will have a car capable of
mixing it up with his famous father.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be really weird the first time I try to pass him on
the track, if I get a chance to pass him,'' Dale Jr. said. ``But
it's something that will be exciting for both of us, I'm sure.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Pit stops &QL; 
 &QL; 
Bob Glidden, NHRA's all-time winningest driver, is coming out of
retirement to compete in next week's U.S. Nationals.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Rahal on Monday will announce his replacement driver. &QL;

BUCKS GET IN LINE FOR SKILES' ATTENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Scott Skiles summer tour may be adding yet another stop.
</P>
<P>
   Skiles, who joined the Suns as an assistant coach last season,
has been mentioned as a candidate for coaching jobs with the
Chicago Bulls, Sacramento Kings, Los Angeles Clippers and Denver
Nuggets, and now apparently is a candidate for the Milwaukee Bucks
job.
</P>
<P>
   Suns General Manager Bryan Colangelo said Friday that Skiles'
name has surfaced as a possible candidate for the Bucks, who fired
Chris Ford this week. Skiles interviewed for the Chicago job, and
the Kings have asked for permission to interview him.
</P>
<P>
   Reportedly, &QL; 
 &QL; 
the Clippers were to interview Skiles, but Colangelo said he has
not formally been asked by any teams other than Chicago and
Sacramento for permission to talk with Skiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to someone from the Clippers (Thursday) about
other things, and his name came up,'' Colangelo said. ``The
question was about my opinion of Skiles. They may have interest,
but there has been no formal indication of it. ``His name has come
up everywhere from Los Angeles to Milwaukee now. There seems to be
a short list of candidates out there. The three names that keep
coming up are Scott, Rick Carlisle and Kurt Rambis.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlisle is an Indiana assistant, and Rambis is a Lakers
assistant. Of the veteran coaches still out there, former Seattle
Coach George Karl tops the list. Former Chicago Coach Phil Jackson
also is without a job, although he may not be interested in working
this season. Former San Antonio Coach Bob Hill, who lobbied hard
for the Seattle job eventually won by Paul Westphal, also continues
to emerge as a possible candidate for the vacant jobs. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Back to Flag &QL; 
 &QL; 
After a one-year absence, the Suns will return their October
training camp to Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, if there
is a training camp in October.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns held camp in Phoenix last season, using America West
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said last year it was a one-year experiment,'' Colangelo
said. ``Last year, we had an established team with a lot of veteran
players. We might have a similar situation this year, but we don't
know yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo said Coach Danny Ainge wants the players in a more
remote location to build team chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   What if the current lockout goes into training camp or delays
the start of the season?
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no contingency plan for a rescheduled or relocated
training camp yet,'' Colangelo said. ``Obviously, anything we do
will at least have an out as far as our commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Proski on mend &QL; 
 &QL; 
Joe Proski, the dean of NBA trainers who has been with the Suns
since their inception in 1968, is recovering from serious back
surgery. He apparently experienced numbness in his legs while
attending an Arizona Diamondbacks game earlier in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo said Proski is doing well and will be back for his
32nd season with the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing great,'' Colangelo said. ``He was in the hospital
for a couple of weeks. He's still hobbling a little, but doing
well.''
</P>
<P>
   He must be feeling better. Through his career, Proski has had
more hairstyle and facial-hair changes than a member of the Federal
Witness Protection Program. And he's got another for the upcoming
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of an Anthony Hopkins look,'' Colangelo said. ``We
like it.'' &QL; 
 &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In 1985, during a flurry of terrorist attacks on
Americans abroad, John McMahon, then deputy director of Central
Intelligence, stared at a startling document sent to the CIA by the
National Security Council staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We received a draft secret executive order telling us to go
knock off terrorists in pre-emptive strikes,'' McMahon recalled in
an interview. ``I told our folks to send it back and tell them:
`When the president revokes the executive order which precludes CIA
from assassinations, then we'll take this on.' That hit the guys on
the NSC staff. They went ballistic.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate McMahon recounted has been going on for a generation:
Should the United States try to assassinate terrorists and tyrants?
</P>
<P>
   Since 1976, when an executive order outlawing such killings took
effect, the answer has been no, and five presidents have stuck to
it. The order says, ``No person employed by or acting on behalf of
the United States government shall engage in, or conspire to engage
in, assassination.''
</P>
<P>
   The ban followed a national revulsion at murder plots hatched at
the White House against people like Fidel Castro. ``Americans were
repulsed by the efforts of CIA in the 1960s to assassinate foreign
leaders,'' said Jeffrey Smith, a former general counsel at the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   The argument is raging again. The ``kill 'em all _ let God sort
'em out'' school of counterterrorism has been revived by the
attacks on U.S. embassies in Africa, which have been attributed to
the wealthy Saudi exile Osama bin Laden and his Islamic acolytes.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, said, ``There should be nothing that should not be on
the table'' when it comes to fighting terrorists. Former CIA
officer Reuel Gerecht wrote in The Wall Street Journal: ``In the
war against terrorism _ against those who are killing Americans _
the U.S. must be willing to kill terrorist chiefs. The only way to
stop Mr. bin Laden is to kill him.''
</P>
<P>
   A skillful assassination would arguably be a more efficient
means of counterattack than the cruise missiles fired at bin
Laden's base camps in Afghanistan. Those missiles killed a
significant number of Pakistani guerrillas training to fight Hindus
in India, but seem to have left bin Laden and almost all of his
anti-American followers unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the difference between killing lots of people with
missiles and killing one with a sniper's rifle? All the difference
in the world, say former CIA officers and current military and
diplomatic officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ban on assassination has been widely supported by
virtually everyone in the executive branch, from the military
through the CIA's clandestine service,'' Smith said. ``First,
assassination clearly invites a direct retaliation against not only
the president but other senior government officials and private
Americans. Second, we have adequate authority to engage in military
actions or covert actions involving the use of lethal force without
targeting a particular individual for assassination. Third, it is
just not in keeping with American values.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House can authorize CIA officers and Pentagon
commandos to use lethal force in operations against people like bin
Laden and his supporters without specifically calling for their
deaths. That authority was underscored by a 1996 law passed by
Congress, signed by President Clinton, and cited as justification
for the cruise missile attacks on Afghanistan and Sudan. It says,
``The president should use all necessary means, including covert
action and military force, to disrupt, dismantle and destroy
international infrastructures used by international terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Clinton has signed a secret order authorizing the use
of lethal force against bin Laden's organization, according to
administration officials. What that means _ and this is a fine
line, but a bright one _ is that the president has given spooks and
soldiers the power to try to destroy bin Laden without giving a
direct order to kill him.
</P>
<P>
   There are precedents. The 1985 draft that shocked McMahon was
part of a secret presidential order authorizing the overthrow of
Col. Moammar el-Gadhafi of Libya, former intelligence officials
say. ``It was clear we were going to use lethal force,'' one said.
``If the use of that lethal force in mounting a coup led to
Gadhafi's dying, we would not be distressed.'' The United States
later bombed the Libyan leader's headquarters, killing his
daughter. Some people in the intelligence community feel the 1988
bombing of Pan Am 103 over Scotland, which killed 270 people, was
Gadhafi's revenge.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is how to fight terrorism without acting like
terrorists. ``To begin to behave like terrorists undermines our
role as a leader in respect for the rule of law and respect for
human rights,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the United States has dealt with the problem by openly
declaring war and defining bin Laden and his group as military
targets. Its tools are missiles and spies, not the poison-tipped
ballpoint pens and cigar-chomping Mafia hitmen that the government
tried to use against Castro of Cuba in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   (And just last week, the government indicted seven
Cuban-Americans on charges of plotting to do what the CIA tried to
do 35 years ago _ kill Castro).
</P>
<P>
   ``What we did in clear and careful daylight, in good conscience,
on the question of assassination is in my view correct,'' said
Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering. ``It distinguishes us
from those who adopt assassination and terror as a weapon.''

   BEIJING _ The Clinton sex scandals have received widespread
coverage in the popular Chinese press, and quickie books
chronicling the president's troubles are best-sellers at subway
stands. As a result, pictures of President Clinton, Monica Lewinsky
and even Linda Tripp are everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   A story that had been a quiet fascination among a few became a
bit of a media frenzy last week when Clinton admitted he had an
inappropriate relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. Many newspapers
carried front-page articles. The Communist Party newspaper, The
People's Daily, reported the development, but the gist of the story
was that Clinton should be allowed to get on with his work.
</P>
<P>
   In the popular Chinese view, Ms. Lai Wen Si Ji, as she is known
here, is seen as a bit player in what many regard as Clinton's
tragic and inexplicable downfall. Tragic because Clinton is
extremely popular here, especially since his state visit this
summer. And inexplicable because the Chinese fully expect that
political leaders will have wives and girlfriends too. So what's
the big deal?
</P>
<P>
   Most people know Ms. Lewinsky's face. And readers of livelier
newspapers like The Beijing Youth Daily, know her name and that she
was a White House intern as well. But beyond that she is more or
less a cardboard temptress who many hold responsible for a hero's
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two of them used to have a good relationship, but now she
stands up and charges him like this,'' said a 30-year-old secretary
near the Jian Guo Men subway station who gave only her surname, An.
``It's not right.''
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton's live televised speeches in Beijing this summer,
most Chinese consider him smart, dashing and debonaire.
</P>
<P>
   In an informal poll, some called Ms. Lewinsky glamorous but
others wonder why Clinton would have fallen for someone ``not
nearly as pretty as Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese responded well to Clinton's televised confession of
Aug. 17. They overwhelming support Clinton's plea for privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's his own business and has nothing to do with politics,''
said Yu Liping, as she headed home from her job at a state
publishing house.
</P>
<P>
   One radio journalist who has covered the matter, and who
requested anonymity, said: ``This just doesn't make sense. We
always think of America as such an open and free-thinking society.
But in this regard, you are much more conservative than us.''
</P>
<P>
   So as some Americans cry for blood, the Chinese _ who are given
little information about their leaders' personal lives but suspect
much _ believe Clinton should be left alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people are too critical,'' said Yu Xiaowei, a
Beijing bookseller. ``Having a few girlfriends is not a big deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some Chinese leaders have had dozens,'' he added, pointing to
Chen Xitong, the former mayor of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   But Chen is perhaps not a role model whom Clinton wants to
emulate. In August he was sent to jail for 16 years for misusing
public funds and improper financial dealings.

   PANAMA CITY, Panama _ There is an argument to be made that the
favorite pastime of Latin American politicians is neither soccer
nor baseball, but tinkering with their countries' constitutions.
</P>
<P>
   Take Panamanian President Ernesto Perez Balladares. He doesn't
like the prohibition against immediate re-election that has existed
here since Theodore Roosevelt engineered Panama's breakaway from
Colombia nearly a century ago, so Panamanians are trudging to the
polls Sunday, Aug. 30, to vote on a measure that would allow him to
seek a second consecutive term next year.
</P>
<P>
   Given the track record of some of their neighbors, Panamanians
can consider themselves lucky. The Dominican Republic has had 32
different constitutions in just over 150 years, while Haiti, its
neighbor on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola, has had 24 since
1804. Venezuela is South America's champion, with 25 separate
charters in 187 years, and in Central America, El Salvador,
Honduras and Nicaragua have each had 14 constitutions since
splitting from Spain early in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``The constitutional history of Latin America is the most
convulsive in the world,'' said Jose Luis Cordeiro, a Venezuelan
economist and journalist who is the author of a recent book, ``The
Second Death of Bolivar,'' that examines the region's propensity to
replace its charters. ``Constitutions seem to have become like
shirts, not even suits, which rulers put on and take off at their
whim.''
</P>
<P>
   To many Latin Americans, the roots of the phenomenon can be
traced to colonial times. In those days, kings in Madrid or Lisbon
and their viceroys were fond of issuing edicts that seemed lofty on
paper but which rulers and their distant subjects knew could never
be enforced. From that experience came a proverb still used across
Latin America to describe the prevailing attitude toward laws and
decrees: ``I obey, but I do not comply.''
</P>
<P>
   In such an environment, constitutions have come to be seen as
statements of aspirations rather than binding declarations of
principles. Latin American constitutions tend to be lengthy
documents with dozens of chapters and scores of articles, written
in florid language that promises more safeguards and services than
their U.S. counterpart while specifying more obligations. Panama's
current charter, for instance, has 322 articles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Constitutions in our countries tend to be a rigid compilation
of regulations or a type of detailed administrative code, more
formal than real,'' said Miguel Antonio Bernal, a prominent legal
scholar and political commentator here. ``They exist not to
guarantee rights, but to legitimize abuses, to allow whoever is in
power to leave the reflection of his own interests.''
</P>
<P>
   The end result for the average citizen, of course, is antipathy
mixed with cynicism, as each ruler imposes a constitution tailored
to his own needs and recruits jurists willing to bend to his will.
Another proverb popular in Latin America warns that, ``He who makes
the law makes the loopholes.'' Or as a member of the Panamanian
Supreme Court, put it recently in a lecture to law students here,
``The constitution is what we, the judges, say it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout modern Latin American history, the issue of
re-election has been inextricably linked to that of constitutions.
Since the typical caudillo, or strongman, always wants to modify or
replace the existing charter with one of his own, one country after
another has thought it logical to prevent the emergence of such
strongmen by writing constitutions that simply forbid any president
from serving two consecutive terms. Thus, the Mexican Revolution
took as its slogan, ``Effective suffrage and no re-election.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's heads of state, though democratically elected, persist
in seeking to mold their societies and institutions to their own
desires. Perez Balladares is by no means an aberration: over the
past five years, other ``modernizers,'' including Alberto Fujimori
of Peru, Carlos Saul Menem of Argentina and Fernando Henrique
Cardoso of Brazil, have all sought, and gained, constitutional
changes that allowed them to seek re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Peru's Congress on Aug. 27 told Fujimori, the originator
of the trend, that he could go after a third term without getting
public approval in a referendum..
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are seeing is the revival of the old Latin American
tradition of caudillismo in technocratic clothing,'' said Ricardo
Arias Calderon, a former vice president of Panama. These new
leaders ``say they have found the magic formula and are the only
ones who know how to apply it,'' he said. That is dangerous,
Calderon added, because ``in Latin America, unlike North America, a
president is almost a king during his reign'' and thus has the
means to impose ``a civilian dictatorship.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are few signs that Latin America's procession of
constitutions is about to stop. Colombia, Paraguay and Peru have
all approved new charters since 1990, and with the United States
and Latin America formally committed to a hemispheric free trade
agreement by 2005, other countries will soon be obliged to follow
suit. No one has asked him, but Cordeiro has a few words of advice
to those who will draft those texts: Less is better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The experience of Latin America has clearly demonstrated that
the answer to political crises is not to pass more and more laws
each time, above all if these are defective or are not applied, but
in having a few good laws that are respected,'' he said. ``If laws
are neither institutionalized nor implemented, they are useless.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The contrast is striking. With Russia on the ropes late last
week, U.S. officials were hardly forthcoming on what they might do,
offering reporters only the assurance that they were studying the
situation and urging the new Russian government to ``stay the
course of reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding President Clinton's planned trip to Moscow this week
for a summit meeting with President Boris Yeltsin, a senior
official said simply, ``We will not hit the ground with a bag of
tricks.''
</P>
<P>
   Flash back to March 23, 1993. It was Clinton's first full-dress
news conference as president, and Russia was in crisis then too.
Clinton's words were, ``We are not bystanders,'' and, ``I intend to
go in there with an aggressive and quite specific plan for American
partnership.''
</P>
<P>
   The odyssey from full-throated engagement to mournful and
bewildered encouragement has been a long and messy one filled more
with failure than success. The apparent inertia may be partly a
result of distractions like the Monica Lewinsky affair. But for
some scholars, like Stephen F. Cohen, a professor of Russian
studies at New York University, it is more a direct consequence of
what he considers a foolish and self-centered ``American crusade to
transform Russia into a replica of American democratic capitalism
and junior partner in world affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   American ideology, he asserts, has ``hit the iceberg of Russian
reality,'' so it is no surprise that the policy's proponents have
nothing to say now. He says that while he too would like to see
Russia democratic and oriented to free markets, the path toward
that goal has to be more gradual, more mixed, more genuinely
Russian.
</P>
<P>
   What Russian poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko has called ``the
McDonaldization of Russia'' has proved a failure, Cohen believes.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Goldman, a Russia expert at Harvard University, agrees
that U.S. policy has not been the wisest in recent years. But he
also says there is little Washington can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the patient is dying of cancer, you can pray and make him
more comfortable, but little else,'' he said. ``We gave the
Russians poor and contradictory advice, but even if our advice had
been good it would have been awfully difficult to undo 70 years of
communism and Cold War without serious repercussions.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Washington chooses to do in the coming weeks, it
appears to be sobered by nearly seven difficult years _ first under
President George Bush and then under Clinton _ of trying to shape
post-Soviet Russia in its own image.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there is still considerable debate as to how much the
United States has truly invested in Russian reform. There are those
who say that Washington has been far too deeply involved, that it
has been trying to micromanage a government and economy that it
poorly understands. This has turned the initial Russian love affair
with American culture and liberty into an ugly, reactionary
anti-Americanism.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of this view point to the legions of Americans sent
swarming through the Kremlin and Russian industry to proffer
advice, insist on painful ``shock therapy'' and even demand that
certain candidates fill key government jobs. While the Russian
people suffered, American advisers urged patience.
</P>
<P>
   There are others who say the problem has not been undue American
involvement in Russia but rather shortsighted disengagement _ both
materially and politically. They say Washington may have talked a
great deal about aid, but it never really spent the kind of money
needed to bail out and stabilize a nation that, after all, occupies
the largest land mass of any country in the world, has thousands of
nuclear missiles and sees itself as a great power.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have given material aid only in small amounts,'' said Padma
Desai, a professor of economics at Columbia University. ``We spent
billions fighting Communism but once the Soviet Union collapsed we
were very selective in material help.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., who was chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs Subcommittee on International Operations, summed up a
prevailing U.S. view on policy toward Moscow when in June 1991, six
months before the Soviet Union collapsed, he said: ``We now have
the opportunity to participate in the most fundamental change in a
major society in the 20th century and to help shape that society in
a way that will give us an opportunity to minimize our defense
expenditures.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, when the Soviet Union was collapsing,
Secretary of State James Baker organized Operation Provide Hope,
which sent hundreds of tons of food to the fracturing empire.
</P>
<P>
   For some analysts at the time, this was woefully insufficient.
Former President Richard M. Nixon circulated a memorandum in March
1992 accusing Bush of failing to recognize the significance of the
opportunity before him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes are high and we are playing as if it were a
penny-ante game,'' Nixon wrote. ``The hot-button issue in the 1950s
was `Who lost China?' If Yeltsin goes down, the question `Who lost
Russia?' will be an infinitely more devastating issue in the
1990s.''
</P>
<P>
   Anders Aslund, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace in Washington, argues that it was Bush, in
fact, who lost Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big mistake was when the Bush administration did not
support Russian reforms in 1991 and 1992,'' he said. ``They were in
a total financial mess and they tried to do all the right things.
The United States didn't provide them with a cent. Instead they
held this conference on humanitarian aid like they were discussing
Sudan or something.''

   Asked why such a course was chosen, Aslund speculated that
``Bush thought that to win re-election in November he could not be

   Others assert that Clinton has been too doggedly pro-Yeltsin,
supporting the Russian leader when he had the military storm the
Parliament in 1993, bombed and attacked the breakaway republic of
Chechnya and drafted what some consider an authoritarian
constitution. They say Clinton's support rendered U.S. talk of
freedom and democracy hollow and paved the way for reactionary
forces to rise again. This was worsened, according to this line of
thinking, by American insistence on expanding NATO to include
Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic, thereby adding to Russia's
sense of isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Most scholars, however, say the question of who lost Russia is
the wrong one, first because it is not yet lost and second because
Russia's future does not depend wholly on U.S. policy. Moreover, no
one really knows what it means for a major nuclear power ``to go
under.'' Russia's sheer size and remaining military might mean that
the United States will always feel the need for involvement.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a sentiment emerging that Russia may have to
be dealt with more on its own terms. There are differences over
NATO, Bosnia, Iran and Iraq but they should be seen as reflecting
differing interests and histories rather than as disobedience by a
junior partner. If the path to a market economy includes temporary
price controls or some level of state industry for a while, that
does not have to augur a return to communism, some scholars insist.

<P>
   The contrast is striking. With Russia on the ropes late last
week, U.S. officials were hardly forthcoming on what they might do,
offering reporters only the assurance that they were studying the
situation and urging the new Russian government to ``stay the
course of reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding President Clinton's planned trip to Moscow this week
for a summit meeting with President Boris Yeltsin, a senior
official said simply, ``We will not hit the ground with a bag of
tricks.''
</P>
<P>
   Flash back to March 23, 1993. It was Clinton's first full-dress
news conference as president, and Russia was in crisis then too.
Clinton's words were, ``We are not bystanders,'' and, ``I intend to
go in there with an aggressive and quite specific plan for American
partnership.''
</P>
<P>
   The odyssey from full-throated engagement to mournful and
bewildered encouragement has been a long and messy one filled more
with failure than success. The apparent inertia may be partly a
result of distractions like the Monica Lewinsky affair. But for
some scholars, like Stephen F. Cohen, a professor of Russian
studies at New York University, it is more a direct consequence of
what he considers a foolish and self-centered ``American crusade to
transform Russia into a replica of American democratic capitalism
and junior partner in world affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   American ideology, he asserts, has ``hit the iceberg of Russian
reality,'' so it is no surprise that the policy's proponents have
nothing to say now. He says that while he too would like to see
Russia democratic and oriented to free markets, the path toward
that goal has to be more gradual, more mixed, more genuinely
Russian.
</P>
<P>
   What Russian poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko has called ``the
McDonaldization of Russia'' has proved a failure, Cohen believes.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Goldman, a Russia expert at Harvard University, agrees
that U.S. policy has not been the wisest in recent years. But he
also says there is little Washington can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the patient is dying of cancer, you can pray and make him
more comfortable, but little else,'' he said. ``We gave the
Russians poor and contradictory advice, but even if our advice had
been good it would have been awfully difficult to undo 70 years of
communism and Cold War without serious repercussions.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Washington chooses to do in the coming weeks, it
appears to be sobered by nearly seven difficult years _ first under
President George Bush and then under Clinton _ of trying to shape
post-Soviet Russia in its own image.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there is still considerable debate as to how much the
United States has truly invested in Russian reform. There are those
who say that Washington has been far too deeply involved, that it
has been trying to micromanage a government and economy that it
poorly understands. This has turned the initial Russian love affair
with American culture and liberty into an ugly, reactionary
anti-Americanism.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of this view point to the legions of Americans sent
swarming through the Kremlin and Russian industry to proffer
advice, insist on painful ``shock therapy'' and even demand that
certain candidates fill key government jobs. While the Russian
people suffered, American advisers urged patience.
</P>
<P>
   There are others who say the problem has not been undue American
involvement in Russia but rather shortsighted disengagement _ both
materially and politically. They say Washington may have talked a
great deal about aid, but it never really spent the kind of money
needed to bail out and stabilize a nation that, after all, occupies
the largest land mass of any country in the world, has thousands of
nuclear missiles and sees itself as a great power.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have given material aid only in small amounts,'' said Padma
Desai, a professor of economics at Columbia University. ``We spent
billions fighting Communism but once the Soviet Union collapsed we
were very selective in material help.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., who was chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs Subcommittee on International Operations, summed up a
prevailing U.S. view on policy toward Moscow when in June 1991, six
months before the Soviet Union collapsed, he said: ``We now have
the opportunity to participate in the most fundamental change in a
major society in the 20th century and to help shape that society in
a way that will give us an opportunity to minimize our defense
expenditures.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, when the Soviet Union was collapsing,
Secretary of State James Baker organized Operation Provide Hope,
which sent hundreds of tons of food to the fracturing empire.
</P>
<P>
   For some analysts at the time, this was woefully insufficient.
Former President Richard M. Nixon circulated a memorandum in March
1992 accusing Bush of failing to recognize the significance of the
opportunity before him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes are high and we are playing as if it were a
penny-ante game,'' Nixon wrote. ``The hot-button issue in the 1950s
was `Who lost China?' If Yeltsin goes down, the question `Who lost
Russia?' will be an infinitely more devastating issue in the
1990s.''
</P>
<P>
   Anders Aslund, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace in Washington, argues that it was Bush, in
fact, who lost Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big mistake was when the Bush administration did not
support Russian reforms in 1991 and 1992,'' he said. ``They were in
a total financial mess and they tried to do all the right things.
The United States didn't provide them with a cent. Instead they
held this conference on humanitarian aid like they were discussing
Sudan or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why such a course was chosen, Aslund speculated that
``Bush thought that to win re-election in November he could not be
seen helping other countries.''
</P>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite a decade of steadily rising prosperity, a
million more Americans a year are losing the protective umbrella of
health insurance. As a result, more than 41 million people, or 15
percent of the population, don't have coverage.
</P>
<P>
   They lack insured care because they can't get it at work or
can't afford it. Most are adults under 65, the age when they become
eligible for Medicare. Most are men. Most have no children at home,
so they are ineligible for Medicaid, the insurance program for the
poor. Most have jobs, or live with someone who works, but their
incomes, typically below $25,000 a year, make them ineligible for
Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as their numbers grow, the uninsured are finding that
their last resort _ charity care _ is being threatened by the rapid
expansion of managed care, which is putting tremendous financial
pressure on doctors and hospitals to focus their resources on
insured patients.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that in crises the uninsured can take their diabetes,
their rotted teeth, their tuberculosis, their hypertension, their
addictions, their obesity, their asthma attacks _ all scourges of
the poor _ to emergency rooms, where by law they must be seen and
treated free.
</P>
<P>
   For less urgent care, they can go to doctors' offices, public
hospitals and clinics subsidized by the government and
philanthropic groups. Often, that care is free as well, or the
patient agrees to pay a few dollars a month for it, albeit for
years.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, anything beyond emergency treatment has
become harder to get in much of the country. As managed care has
expanded to cover 85 percent of the working population, it has
succeeded in stabilizing costs for employers and their managed care
subscribers. And the government is reaping similar rewards for
taxpayers by steering Medicaid recipients and the elderly into
managed care plans, and by cutting Medicare reimbursements to
doctors, hospitals and health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   But as part of the process of containing costs, the government
and the managed care industry have also pressured doctors to ake
cuts in their incomes or to take on more paying or insured patients
to maintain their current incomes, which has left them with less
time for charity.
</P>
<P>
   One fraying thread of the safety net is the Most Holy Trinity
Catholic Church's medical clinic in the Corktown neighborhood of
Detroit. Sister Mary Ellen Howard, the registered nurse who manages
the clinic, uses volunteer physicians and nurses to treat 3,000
patients a year, all uninsured, on an annual budget of $50,000
collected from small foundations.
</P>
<P>
   The care is free, but there's less of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had somebody come in here who had blood in his urine,''
Sister Mary Ellen said. ``He needed further diagnostic study, and
we couldn't do it. He couldn't go to an emergency room because
that's not an emergency. There was a urologist I could call and
say, `Joe, will you take this one client?' He would take him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now when I call, he says, `Sorry,''' she added, noting that he
has cut back on charity care because he has to see more and more
patients to maintain his income. ``My clients are able to get
primary care here,'' Sister Mary Ellen said. ``But I cannot get any
kind of a specialist to see a poor person in the city of Detroit.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Corlin, a senior officer of the American Medical
Association and a gastroenterologist in Santa Monica, Calif., says
he won't turn away poor patients sent by a similar clinic in nearby
Venice who need gall bladder removals and colonoscopies. But he
says the government, like managed care, is draining his reserves
for charity.
</P>
<P>
   Once, Corlin said, he could ``balance bill'' by charging wealthy
Medicare patients the difference between Medicare's reimbursement
for a procedure, which might be $180, and his usual fee of $300,
and then use the difference for charity. Balance billing is now
prohibited by the government, and because of falling reimbursements
from both Medicare and HMOs, Corlin says he now collects 50 percent
of his standard fees, compared with 75 or 80 percent 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Such complaints by health care providers help explain the
findings of a survey in June sponsored by the Henry J. Kaiser
Family Foundation, which specializes in health-care philanthropy.
``Contrary to a common belief that the uninsured are able to get
the medical care they need from doctors and hospitals, in 1997
uninsured adults were four times more likely than those with
private health insurance to say they did not receive the medical
care they believed to be necessary,'' the survey found. ``Over half
said they had postponed getting care, and a quarter had not filled
a medical prescription _ both because they could not afford it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kaiser foundation and many providers of charity care say
shortchanging the uninsured by treating them only in emergencies is
often more costly than preventive care _ for the patient, for the
health care provider and for the overall economy.
</P>
<P>
   An uninsured diabetic is cheap to treat when he is delivered
comatose to an emergency room and dies. But a more typical
emergency-room visit brings charges of $200 to $500, which the
hospital often swallows as charity care.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joy Everson, director of patient financial services at Good
Samaritan Hospital in Phoenix, says an ``emergency treat and
release'' costs $50. An EKG costs $125, and the doctor who reads it
charges $50 to $100. Holding a patient for observation costs $26 an
hour. Admitting him to the hospital costs $725 a day.
</P>
<P>
   In the argot of emergency rooms, many uninsured patients are
``train wrecks.'' They show up every month or so, with asthma
attacks or chest pains, and incur similar charges each time. But a
patient in a managed care plan, receiving the regular preventive
care that prolongs lives and spares the emergency room, is cheaper
to care for.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason people dismiss the problem of the uninsured is that
they don't believe people are turned away,'' said Drew Altman,
president of the Kaiser Family Foundation. ``They're right. What
happens is people delay getting care. And when they get it, they
are more expensive to treat.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jonathan Weisbruch, director of the Maricopa County Health
Department in Phoenix and a former medical director for the county
of Los Angeles, estimates that universal care and prevention could
curb the nation's $1 trillion spending on health care by one-third.
``If we intervene with people when they're 45 years old, get them
to do things like stop smoking and reducing their weight,'' he
said, ``imagine what that would do to the cost of Medicare after
they're 65.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ It is sometimes said that extraordinary times produce
extraordinary leaders. But if so, where are they?
</P>
<P>
   Many experts in foreign affairs worry about what they see as a
perilous combination of Brobdingnagian challenges to international
stability and Lilliputian authority among the political leaders
tackling them.
</P>
<P>
   With the Asian meltdown spreading to Russia and undermining
Europe, China and Latin America, some experts fret about the risk
of a severe global downturn, perhaps another depression, with
incalculable political and military risks. But just as the threats
to world order seem unusually grave and complex, leaders in major
capitals appear unusually enfeebled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we are on the verge of massive international
dislocations, which may have started in one country, Thailand, but
have created the real prospect of global financial instability,''
said Jeffrey Garten, the dean of the Yale School of Management.
``The reason this is potentially calamitous is that no one is in
charge.''
</P>
<P>
   That is something that President Clinton might discuss with
President Boris Yeltsin at their summit meeting in Moscow this
week. But the metaphor of a summit seems inappropriately robust;
these days the most fitting location for any meeting of the Group
of Eight industrialized nations might be a hospital ward, where
presidents could compare scars and take bets on who will survive
longest.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is so hobbled by scandal that he cannot even launch
missiles against alleged Afghan-based Arab terrorists _ against
whom it would normally take about two seconds to build a domestic
consensus to bomb _ without widespread doubts that the missiles
weren't at least in part an attempt to change the subject.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, the uncertainty is not whether Yeltsin will run again
in 2000 (he said last week he wouldn't), but whether he can even
finish his present term. In Germany, which has much at risk in
Russia's moribund economy, Helmut Kohl may be unseated in elections
next month after 16 years as Chancellor of Europe's powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi is limping along in his
first weeks in office, looking a bit dazed and struggling to show
some national leadership for the first time in his 35 years in
Parliament. Even in China, President Jiang Zemin has been humbled
by severe floods and by an economy that has been slowing
ineluctably.
</P>
<P>
   The only major figure who has sustained his authority is British
Prime Minister Tony Blair, and he has been distracted by the
turmoil in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Domestic, social and economic forces are overwhelming
political leaders everywhere,'' warned Professor Michel Oksenberg,
an international relations expert at Stanford University. Oksenberg
argues that the challenges to international order can be addressed
only at the political level, and that there is no correcting
mechanism _ say, global market forces _ that will insure that
everything works out well in the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the world is on auto-pilot,'' he said. ``If so,
I'd hate to say where the plane is headed.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is difficult to argue that the threats to the
global economic order today are more serious than the risk of
nuclear annihilation during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Yet except for periods like the Cuban missile crisis, back then
there at least seemed to be a predictability to international
events, some notion of what might happen if the world did not
explode into a fireball. These days, it seems more likely that
there will be a tomorrow, but less clear what it will look like.
</P>
<P>
   Political scientist Francis Fukuyama published a famous essay in
1989 arguing that the collapse of communism marked ``the end of
history.'' The great debates that had animated history, he
suggested in that essay and in a subsequent book, had been
resolved. But now he has fresh doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The past few months have been really the first time since the
beginning of the decade that I felt that I could really be proven
wrong in the argument that I laid out in `The End of History,'''
Fukuyama mused in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two things on the horizon that I think are really
quite scary: that the Asian crisis could broaden into a global
depression, in which case all bets are off about everything; and
essentially that Russia could fail in its attempt to Westernize and
go backward seriously,'' he added. ``Both of those may really
develop.''
</P>
<P>
   A third and related challenge, one that many experts cite as
requiring concentrated efforts by the world's leaders, is the
threat of proliferation of nuclear arms and other weapons of mass
destruction. Recent events are not encouraging. The longest-serving
American arms inspector in Iraq quit in protest last week, saying
the Clinton administration was unwilling to force Baghdad to reveal
its hidden weapons programs and was instead engaging in a charade.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts suggest that India may have been successful in
surprising the world with its nuclear tests this spring in part
because officials were not paying enough attention. And experts
also worry about Pakistan as its joins Russia on the list of
nuclear powers with disintegrating economies.
</P>
<P>
   What should the world's leaders be doing about these challenges?
The answers vary, although everyone agrees that the first priority
for people like Yeltsin and Obuchi is to stop the self-inflicted
injuries that are threatening international stability. Yeltsin's
withdrawal from day-to-day decision-making and his firing of his
prime minister and economic team a few days ago have worsened the
collapse of the ruble, and Obuchi is so weak that six bills vital
to Japan's economic restructuring program are stuck in Parliament,
aggravating the Asian crisis.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As for the United States, its economy is the envy of the world,
but Clinton has been unable to wrest money from Congress to
replenish the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   There remains a vigorous debate within America about whether the
IMF has done more harm than good, but many foreign officials say
that Clinton's failure to deliver the money has limited the fund's
ability to combat the crisis in Russia and has, more broadly, added
to the unease in global markets. Already, some analysts are blaming
Kohl and Clinton for not having done more to bail out Russia when
its reformist economic team was still in power.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, many government officials worry that if the United
States economy falters, Clinton will be too weakened to resist
protectionist pressures from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The wavering and weakness among major leaders now contrasts with
other moments of international crisis, like World War II and its
aftermath. Figures like Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt
commanded enormous authority once the allies faced up to the
threats posed by expansionist Germany and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   And even a seemingly weak president like Harry Truman, dealing
with a Republican Congress, managed an extraordinary agenda,
including the formation of the United Nations, the Marshall Plan,
the Berlin airlift and the Bretton Woods economic system.
</P>
<P>
   Garten of Yale argues that crucial differences from that era are
a narrower perspective today and an inattention to political risks
that arise from economic instability. The linkage was more obvious
to people like Truman, who had just fought a world war intimately
connected to the Great Depression: Hitler emerged from the economic
collapse of Weimar Germany and Japanese militarists seized power in
the chaos and misery of the Showa Depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``After World War II, leaders recognized that ultimately
economic problems were political and security problems,'' Garten
said. ``They saw that right away.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that ``people today are far too technical in their
approach'' to global economic instability. ``They don't see the
connection.''
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, there are apparently several reasons why strong
political leaders are scarce today. Some of those reasons may be
more profound than quirks like the strong libido of one president
in Washington and the weak heart of another in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can deride the personalities involved, but I think
something much more fundamental is going on,'' said Oksenberg.
</P>
<P>
   International public opinion surveys, for example, have shown
declining confidence in government in recent years not just in the
United States but also in Canada and most of Europe. Bipartisanship
on foreign affairs has faded. Journalism has become more aggressive
and cynical as commentary has expanded with the technological
capacity to deliver it.
</P>
<P>
   Improvements in technology and communications have also cost
political leaders their monopolies on information and weaponry,
arguably empowering citizens and terrorists at the expense of
presidents. The private sector has gained prestige and
self-confidence, emerging as a rival force to guide policy _ which
may be a good thing at a time when ``political leadership'' seems
an oxymoron.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a saving grace, a force that could compensate for
weak political leadership, it's business,'' said M.Y. Yoshino, a
professor at Harvard Business School. ``Still, that can't
compensate enough. What can you do when the ruble devalues 10
percent overnight?''
</P>
<P>
   In some sense, globalization and the huge pools of capital that
now slosh violently around the world, searching for the highest
return, have taken over a measure of the leadership that once was
demonstrated by national leaders. These oceans of capital now set
the international agenda and overwhelm the modest sums in the
accounts of central banks. The capital is beyond the reach of any
state.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the forces of globalization, however fickle, at times
function as a useful force to guide economic policy. Above all,
there is the discipline of capital markets, which are a powerful
force for prudence.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever Obuchi equivocates about tackling Japan's bad loan
problem, Tokyo stocks tumble and force him to be more direct.
Likewise, the fear of being blamed for a market crash is a major
incentive for both Clinton and Congress to avoid protectionist
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   But the bond market is no substitute for a leader. Japan, more
than any country, demonstrates that economies still require dynamic
politicians to forge a national consensus and set a country's
course. For Japan, in microcosm, has been something like the world
today: a place of powerful markets and puny leadership. If it is a
sign of what is to come, it is not auspicious, for it is a country
of enormous strengths that for eight years has stagnated and
drifted without anyone at the helm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a set of challenges today that are out of the
ordinary,'' said Charles Morrison, president of the East-West
Center in Hawaii. ``It's not a happy picture, because you need
someone to push the agenda along, and it's not going to come from
weak political leadership.''

<P>
   TOKYO _ It is sometimes said that extraordinary times produce
extraordinary leaders. But if so, where are they?
</P>
<P>
   Many experts in foreign affairs worry about what they see as a
perilous combination of Brobdingnagian challenges to international
stability and Lilliputian authority among the political leaders
tackling them.
</P>
<P>
   With the Asian meltdown spreading to Russia and undermining
Europe, China and Latin America, some experts fret about the risk
of a severe global downturn, perhaps another depression, with
incalculable political and military risks. But just as the threats
to world order seem unusually grave and complex, leaders in major
capitals appear unusually enfeebled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we are on the verge of massive international
dislocations, which may have started in one country, Thailand, but
have created the real prospect of global financial instability,''
said Jeffrey Garten, the dean of the Yale School of Management.
``The reason this is potentially calamitous is that no one is in
charge.''
</P>
<P>
   That is something that President Clinton might discuss with
President Boris Yeltsin at their summit meeting in Moscow this
week. But the metaphor of a summit seems inappropriately robust;
these days the most fitting location for any meeting of the Group
of Eight industrialized nations might be a hospital ward, where
presidents could compare scars and take bets on who will survive
longest.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is so hobbled by scandal that he cannot even launch
missiles against alleged Afghan-based Arab terrorists _ against
whom it would normally take about two seconds to build a domestic
consensus to bomb _ without widespread doubts that the missiles
weren't at least in part an attempt to change the subject.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, the uncertainty is not whether Yeltsin will run again
in 2000 (he said last week he wouldn't), but whether he can even
finish his present term. In Germany, which has much at risk in
Russia's moribund economy, Helmut Kohl may be unseated in elections
next month after 16 years as Chancellor of Europe's powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi is limping along in his
first weeks in office, looking a bit dazed and struggling to show
some national leadership for the first time in his 35 years in
Parliament. Even in China, President Jiang Zemin has been humbled
by severe floods and by an economy that has been slowing
ineluctably.
</P>
<P>
   The only major figure who has sustained his authority is British
Prime Minister Tony Blair, and he has been distracted by the
turmoil in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Domestic, social and economic forces are overwhelming
political leaders everywhere,'' warned Professor Michel Oksenberg,
an international relations expert at Stanford University. Oksenberg
argues that the challenges to international order can be addressed
only at the political level, and that there is no correcting
mechanism _ say, global market forces _ that will insure that
everything works out well in the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the world is on auto-pilot,'' he said. ``If so,
I'd hate to say where the plane is headed.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is difficult to argue that the threats to the
global economic order today are more serious than the risk of
nuclear annihilation during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Yet except for periods like the Cuban missile crisis, back then
there at least seemed to be a predictability to international
events, some notion of what might happen if the world did not
explode into a fireball. These days, it seems more likely that
there will be a tomorrow, but less clear what it will look like.
</P>
<P>
   Political scientist Francis Fukuyama published a famous essay in
1989 arguing that the collapse of communism marked ``the end of
history.'' The great debates that had animated history, he
suggested in that essay and in a subsequent book, had been
resolved. But now he has fresh doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The past few months have been really the first time since the
beginning of the decade that I felt that I could really be proven
wrong in the argument that I laid out in `The End of History,'''
Fukuyama mused in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two things on the horizon that I think are really
quite scary: that the Asian crisis could broaden into a global
depression, in which case all bets are off about everything; and
essentially that Russia could fail in its attempt to Westernize and
go backward seriously,'' he added. ``Both of those may really
develop.''
</P>
<P>
   A third and related challenge, one that many experts cite as
requiring concentrated efforts by the world's leaders, is the
threat of proliferation of nuclear arms and other weapons of mass
destruction. Recent events are not encouraging. The longest-serving
American arms inspector in Iraq quit in protest last week, saying
the Clinton administration was unwilling to force Baghdad to reveal
its hidden weapons programs and was instead engaging in a charade.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts suggest that India may have been successful in
surprising the world with its nuclear tests this spring in part
because officials were not paying enough attention. And experts
also worry about Pakistan as its joins Russia on the list of
nuclear powers with disintegrating economies.
</P>
<P>
   What should the world's leaders be doing about these challenges?
The answers vary, although everyone agrees that the first priority
for people like Yeltsin and Obuchi is to stop the self-inflicted
injuries that are threatening international stability. Yeltsin's
withdrawal from day-to-day decision-making and his firing of his
prime minister and economic team a few days ago have worsened the
collapse of the ruble, and Obuchi is so weak that six bills vital
to Japan's economic restructuring program are stuck in Parliament,
aggravating the Asian crisis.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As for the United States, its economy is the envy of the world,
but Clinton has been unable to wrest money from Congress to
replenish the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   There remains a vigorous debate within America about whether the
IMF has done more harm than good, but many foreign officials say
that Clinton's failure to deliver the money has limited the fund's
ability to combat the crisis in Russia and has, more broadly, added
to the unease in global markets. Already, some analysts are blaming
Kohl and Clinton for not having done more to bail out Russia when
its reformist economic team was still in power.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, many government officials worry that if the United
States economy falters, Clinton will be too weakened to resist
protectionist pressures from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The wavering and weakness among major leaders now contrasts with
other moments of international crisis, like World War II and its
aftermath. Figures like Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt
commanded enormous authority once the allies faced up to the
threats posed by expansionist Germany and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   And even a seemingly weak president like Harry Truman, dealing
with a Republican Congress, managed an extraordinary agenda,
including the formation of the United Nations, the Marshall Plan,
the Berlin airlift and the Bretton Woods economic system.
</P>
<P>
   Garten of Yale argues that crucial differences from that era are
a narrower perspective today and an inattention to political risks
that arise from economic instability. The linkage was more obvious
to people like Truman, who had just fought a world war intimately
connected to the Great Depression: Hitler emerged from the economic
collapse of Weimar Germany and Japanese militarists seized power in
the chaos and misery of the Showa Depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``After World War II, leaders recognized that ultimately
economic problems were political and security problems,'' Garten
said. ``They saw that right away.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that ``people today are far too technical in their
approach'' to global economic instability. ``They don't see the
connection.''
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, there are apparently several reasons why strong
political leaders are scarce today. Some of those reasons may be
more profound than quirks like the strong libido of one president
in Washington and the weak heart of another in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can deride the personalities involved, but I think
something much more fundamental is going on,'' said Oksenberg.
</P>
<P>
   International public opinion surveys, for example, have shown
declining confidence in government in recent years not just in the
United States but also in Canada and most of Europe. Bipartisanship
on foreign affairs has faded. Journalism has become more aggressive
and cynical as commentary has expanded with the technological
capacity to deliver it.
</P>
<P>
   Improvements in technology and communications have also cost
political leaders their monopolies on information and weaponry,
arguably empowering citizens and terrorists at the expense of
presidents. The private sector has gained prestige and
self-confidence, emerging as a rival force to guide policy _ which
may be a good thing at a time when ``political leadership'' seems
an oxymoron.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a saving grace, a force that could compensate for
weak political leadership, it's business,'' said M.Y. Yoshino, a
professor at Harvard Business School. ``Still, that can't
compensate enough. What can you do when the ruble devalues 10
percent overnight?''
</P>
<P>
   In some sense, globalization and the huge pools of capital that
now slosh violently around the world, searching for the highest
return, have taken over a measure of the leadership that once was
demonstrated by national leaders. These oceans of capital now set
the international agenda and overwhelm the modest sums in the
accounts of central banks. The capital is beyond the reach of any
state.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the forces of globalization, however fickle, at times
function as a useful force to guide economic policy. Above all,
there is the discipline of capital markets, which are a powerful
force for prudence.
</P>

   NEW YORK _ With Mark McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals and
Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs closing in on Roger Maris' record of
61 home runs in a major league baseball season, people are
recalling the press' shabby treatment of Maris during the summer of
1961.
</P>
<P>
   Many think, especially in light of the furor last week over
McGwire's use of testosterone-boosting pills, that anyone making a
run at the record today is in for a far worse experience than Maris
endured.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps not. In New York's newspapers, Maris faced
unrelenting criticism, not only of his performance but of his
souring mood. Still, while his treatment during his record chase
was brutal enough, only the following spring did he face the
vilification for which he now is remembered. Here are excerpts.
</P>
<P>
   _ By ALAN SCHWARZ
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Maris ran neck-and-neck with Mickey Mantle
until Mantle was injured in September. A bigger source of pressure
was commissioner Ford Frick's ruling on July 17 that Babe Ruth's
record would be considered broken only if it were surpassed in the
season's first 154 games, rather than the 162 to which the season
had just been expanded. Maris' standard reply: ``A season's a
season.'' But most fans supported the edict, as did columnist Dick
Young of the New York Daily News on Aug. 22: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   (Frick's) seems to be the realistic approach. Just as there is a
difference between the 100-yard dash record and 100-meters, so is
there a difference between a home run race over the 154 and
162-game distances. . . . What Maris seems to overlook is that the
Commissioner's deadline has been set for the benefit of Maris and
Mantle, just as much as it has built a protective wall around
Ruth's record. It will spare the M &AMP; M boys from charges of being
``cheese champs.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Young helped mold public opinion, and as
Maris entered September with 51 homers _ and with game 154
approaching at mid-month _ the pressure mounted. The New York Post,
Sept. 11:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday was (Maris') 27th birthday, and each day he has come
closer to destiny has heightened the tension within him as it has
increased the sense of history about him. He hit no homers in
yesterday's doubleheader against the Indians. He has tried to
protect himself with bravado _ ``I do or I don't; that's all there
is to it'' _ but there is also bewilderment that what he is doing
has produced a near air of hysteria among those who are witnessing
his pass at the record that has withstood 34 years.
</P>
<P>
   On Labor Day we had talked just this same way and Maris had
said: ``I wish the damned season were over right now.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``You still wish the same thing?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even more,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)On Sept. 12, Maris temporarily stopped
speaking to the press. This opened him up to ridicule and prompted
negative comparisons to the far more gregarious Mantle. Louis
Effrat of The New York Times reported on Sept. 16:(END ITALICS
HERE)
</P>
<P>
   How does the man who has poled 56 homers and is still four short
of Babe Ruth's record of 60 feel now that he is even with the 1927
Ruthian pace?
</P>
<P>
   Maris didn't say. In fact, Maris wouldn't say anything.
Immediately after the Yankees had split the two games with the
Tigers, an interrogation squad swarmed into the visiting club's
dressing room. . . .
</P>
<P>
   While Mickey Mantle answered all questions and volunteered
information, Maris, the other half of the celebrated M-Squad,
remained in the trainer's room and sulked.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)On Sept. 20, game 154, Maris needed two home
runs at Baltimore to tie Ruth. He hit one. The next day, Harold
Rosenthal of The New York Herald Tribune didn't sound
disappointed:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Roger Maris, the crew-cut modern Yankee, couldn't catch the
laughing ghost of Babe Ruth last night. He crashed his 59th home
run of the season in the third inning, but failed in three more
attempts to sock one out of Memorial Stadium in Ruth's hometown. So
the Ruthian record of 60 over a schedule of 154 games is safe for
this year at least. It remains to be seen what the reaction will be
if Roger belts a few more in the eight games still on this year's
Yankee schedule.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) The Daily News, Sept. 27:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Roger Maris hit the Golden Gopher last night, crashing his 60th
homer to tie Babe Ruth's great and heretofore untouched high of
1927. The blond Bomber drove into the third deck in right field in
the third inning to become the only man ever to equal the immortal
Sultan of Swat. It took him 159 games.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Despite being a home run away from a new
record, Maris didn't play the next game against the Orioles. Weary
and bitter, he didn't even stay for the game, and instead went
shopping in New York with his wife. The Daily News, Sept. 28:(END
ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Roger Maris really doesn't take ``surly pills.'' Baseball's new
home run king only looks that way. More exactly, he acts that way.
The other players call him ``Redneck Roger,'' or a less presentable
variation of same in dugout language. . . .
</P>
<P>
   In fact, his personality is exactly the opposite of the man
whose homer production he matched, Babe Ruth. The Babe roared
through life. He loved people, excitement, fame. He was just a big
kid. Roger is a serious, reticent man. He shuns publicity and many
times in the past month said with complete candor: ``I'm sick of
all this. I wish I were home with my wife and kids. I can't wait
for this season to end.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)The New York Post, Oct. 1: (END ITALICS
HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Success makes people change, and money. Slowly, inevitably,
Roger Maris has become less the charming grouch he used to be and
more the busy, harried, far less personable grouch.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) On the last day of the regular season,
Maris connected with No. 61 off Tracy Stallard of the Boston Red
Sox for a 1-0 Yankee win. Within minutes, scores of reporters
mobbed Maris at his locker. United Press International, Oct. 2:
(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Maris, thoroughly spent from his recent efforts to match Babe
Ruth's record of 60 homers, said he was ``glad the ordeal was
over.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question about it,'' he said in almost a whisper.
``When you have to put up with something like this for two months''
_ gesturing toward a mob of newsmen, photographers, and newsreel
men crowded around his locker _ ``it's bound to affect your mind.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)In the offseason, Maris grew increasingly
resentful over his ordeal. The writers pounced at spring training.
The Post, March 15:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   It's strange. During last season's pressure cooker he behaved
remarkably well, acting cooperative, available, frank and patient.
Only since then has he acquired real bitterness about life in a
goldfish bowl, the inescapable price of his fame and sudden wealth.
. . .
</P>
<P>
   So you hear: ``I'm through being a nice guy. It doesn't pay.
This world isn't made for niceness.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Oscar Fraley of UPI, March 15: (END ITALICS
HERE)
</P>
<P>
   For a man who belabored the ball at a rather anemic .269 clip, I
would have to think that Maris has a rather swollen idea of his
importance. Sports are grand fun when kept in their proper
perspective, but if either of my two sons was a hero, I hope it's a
modest fellow named John Glenn who went for the circuit when it
really counted. Because guys like Maris bat a round zero with me.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Maris' biggest mistake was skipping a
scheduled interview with Jimmy Cannon of The New York
Journal-American, who expected great deference from athletes. The
result was a two-part series in which the columnist excoriated
Maris for his ``defects of personality.'' Cannon's column of March
21:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that dissension caused by Roger the Whiner's
soliloquies may disturb the traditional harmony of the Yankees. The
hostile attitude of Maris . . . has even discouraged those paid to
praise him. They have already become deliberately negligent in
their spent crusade to have him canonized as Ruth's heir. Seldom
has a man in sports so quickly alienated those who originally
offered their respect with gladness provoked by admiration. . . .
</P>
<P>
   I was also guilty of slovenly reporting by not turning it on him
(last year) for his treacherous smallness. The absence of stress
does not diminish his capacity for self-worship. I'll pick up on
him tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)The next day:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   The animosity the others on the squad have for The Whiner has
ruffled the usual serenity of the Yankees. . . . Even Mickey
Mantle, who is now their greatest player and symbol of their casual
efficiency, pretends he is merely one ballplayer on a squad of 25.
</P>
<P>
   The community of baseball feels Mantle is a great player. They
consider Maris a thrilling freak who batted .269.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)On Dec. 8, 1966, Maris was traded to the St.
Louis Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 14, 1985, he died of lymphatic cancer in Gainesville,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 4, 1991, commissioner Fay Vincent removed the separate
listing of Ruth's 154-game record, leaving Maris' standing
alone.(END ITALICS HERE)

record would be considered broken only if it were surpassed in the
season's first 154 games, rather than the 162 to which the season
had just been expanded. Maris' standard reply: ``A season's a
season.'' But most fans supported the edict, as did columnist Dick
Young of the New York Daily News on Aug. 22: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   (Frick's) seems to be the realistic approach. Just as there is a
difference between the 100-yard dash record and 100-meters, so is
there a difference between a home run race over the 154 and
162-game distances. . . . What Maris seems to overlook is that the
Commissioner's deadline has been set for the benefit of Maris and
Mantle, just as much as it has built a protective wall around
Ruth's record. It will spare the M &AMP; M boys from charges of being
``cheese champs.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Young helped mold public opinion, and as
Maris entered September with 51 homers _ and with game 154
approaching at mid-month _ the pressure mounted. The New York Post,
Sept. 11:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday was (Maris') 27th birthday, and each day he has come
closer to destiny has heightened the tension within him as it has
increased the sense of history about him. He hit no homers in
yesterday's doubleheader against the Indians. He has tried to
protect himself with bravado _ ``I do or I don't; that's all there
is to it'' _ but there is also bewilderment that what he is doing
has produced a near air of hysteria among those who are witnessing
his pass at the record that has withstood 34 years.
</P>
<P>
   On Labor Day we had talked just this same way and Maris had
said: ``I wish the damned season were over right now.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``You still wish the same thing?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even more,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)On Sept. 12, Maris temporarily stopped
speaking to the press. This opened him up to ridicule and prompted
negative comparisons to the far more gregarious Mantle. Louis
Effrat of The New York Times reported on Sept. 16:(END ITALICS

</P>
<P>
   How does the man who has poled 56 homers and is still four short
of Babe Ruth's record of 60 feel now that he is even with the 1927
Ruthian pace?
</P>
<P>
   Maris didn't say. In fact, Maris wouldn't say anything.
Immediately after the Yankees had split the two games with the
Tigers, an interrogation squad swarmed into the visiting club's
dressing room. . . .
</P>
<P>
   While Mickey Mantle answered all questions and volunteered
information, Maris, the other half of the celebrated M-Squad,
remained in the trainer's room and sulked.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)On Sept. 20, game 154, Maris needed two home
runs at Baltimore to tie Ruth. He hit one. The next day, Harold
Rosenthal of The New York Herald Tribune didn't sound
disappointed:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Roger Maris, the crew-cut modern Yankee, couldn't catch the
laughing ghost of Babe Ruth last night. He crashed his 59th home
run of the season in the third inning, but failed in three more
attempts to sock one out of Memorial Stadium in Ruth's hometown. So
the Ruthian record of 60 over a schedule of 154 games is safe for
this year at least. It remains to be seen what the reaction will be
if Roger belts a few more in the eight games still on this year's
Yankee schedule.

<P>
   Roger Maris hit the Golden Gopher last night, crashing his 60th
homer to tie Babe Ruth's great and heretofore untouched high of
1927. The blond Bomber drove into the third deck in right field in
the third inning to become the only man ever to equal the immortal
Sultan of Swat. It took him 159 games.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Despite being a home run away from a new
record, Maris didn't play the next game against the Orioles. Weary
and bitter, he didn't even stay for the game, and instead went
shopping in New York with his wife. The Daily News, Sept. 28:(END
ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Roger Maris really doesn't take ``surly pills.'' Baseball's new
home run king only looks that way. More exactly, he acts that way.
The other players call him ``Redneck Roger,'' or a less presentable
variation of same in dugout language. . . .
</P>
<P>
   In fact, his personality is exactly the opposite of the man
whose homer production he matched, Babe Ruth. The Babe roared
through life. He loved people, excitement, fame. He was just a big
kid. Roger is a serious, reticent man. He shuns publicity and many
times in the past month said with complete candor: ``I'm sick of
all this. I wish I were home with my wife and kids. I can't wait
for this season to end.''

   Success makes people change, and money. Slowly, inevitably,
Roger Maris has become less the charming grouch he used to be and
more the busy, harried, far less personable grouch.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) On the last day of the regular season,
Maris connected with No. 61 off Tracy Stallard of the Boston Red
Sox for a 1-0 Yankee win. Within minutes, scores of reporters
mobbed Maris at his locker. United Press International, Oct. 2:
(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Maris, thoroughly spent from his recent efforts to match Babe
Ruth's record of 60 homers, said he was ``glad the ordeal was
over.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question about it,'' he said in almost a whisper.
``When you have to put up with something like this for two months''
_ gesturing toward a mob of newsmen, photographers, and newsreel
men crowded around his locker _ ``it's bound to affect your mind.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)In the offseason, Maris grew increasingly
resentful over his ordeal. The writers pounced at spring training.
The Post, March 15:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   It's strange. During last season's pressure cooker he behaved
remarkably well, acting cooperative, available, frank and patient.
Only since then has he acquired real bitterness about life in a
goldfish bowl, the inescapable price of his fame and sudden wealth.
. . .
</P>
<P>
   So you hear: ``I'm through being a nice guy. It doesn't pay.
This world isn't made for niceness.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Oscar Fraley of UPI, March 15: (END ITALICS
HERE)
</P>
<P>
   For a man who belabored the ball at a rather anemic .269 clip, I
would have to think that Maris has a rather swollen idea of his
importance. Sports are grand fun when kept in their proper
perspective, but if either of my two sons was a hero, I hope it's a
modest fellow named John Glenn who went for the circuit when it
really counted. Because guys like Maris bat a round zero with me.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Maris' biggest mistake was skipping a
scheduled interview with Jimmy Cannon of The New York
Journal-American, who expected great deference from athletes. The
result was a two-part series in which the columnist excoriated
Maris for his ``defects of personality.'' Cannon's column of March
21:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that dissension caused by Roger the Whiner's
soliloquies may disturb the traditional harmony of the Yankees. The
hostile attitude of Maris . . . has even discouraged those paid to
praise him. They have already become deliberately negligent in
their spent crusade to have him canonized as Ruth's heir. Seldom
has a man in sports so quickly alienated those who originally
offered their respect with gladness provoked by admiration. . . .
</P>
<P>
   I was also guilty of slovenly reporting by not turning it on him
(last year) for his treacherous smallness. The absence of stress
does not diminish his capacity for self-worship. I'll pick up on
him tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)The next day:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   The animosity the others on the squad have for The Whiner has
ruffled the usual serenity of the Yankees. . . . Even Mickey
Mantle, who is now their greatest player and symbol of their casual
efficiency, pretends he is merely one ballplayer on a squad of 25.
</P>
<P>
   The community of baseball feels Mantle is a great player. They
consider Maris a thrilling freak who batted .269.
</P>
<P>

Louis Cardinals.

<P>
   When he first arrived to study in the United States, Ashim Datta
was unfamiliar with the microwave oven.
</P>
<P>
   One evening, Datta, who had never seen such an oven in his
native India, wrapped his dinner in aluminum foil, placed it in the
university microwave, and punched ``high.'' Sparks flashed and
smoke began to curl. He waited patiently. Passersby soon explained
to Datta, a graduate student in engineering, that sparks were bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought sparks were part of the normal heating
process,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen years later, he has deepened his understanding of
American microwave ovens. Now a biological engineering researcher
at Cornell University, Professor Datta has moved on from nearly
setting microwave ovens on fire to attempting to answer some of the
most nagging questions confronting the microwave-food industry: Why
is the food so bad? How come, in a typical microwave dinner, the
peas are dry, the ham lukewarm and the mashed potatoes still
frozen?
</P>
<P>
   Pushing the frontiers of food science, Datta has for the first
time developed a comprehensive computer model of what happens to
food in a microwave oven _ the good, the bad and the
stomach-turning.
</P>
<P>
   Datta, an expert in heat and moisture transfer, says that while
microwave energy is being applied in one way to, say, a four-course
TV dinner, the dinner itself is warming in four or more different
ways.
</P>
<P>
   About 95 percent of American homes have a microwave oven, Datta
said, and the ovens' most popular use is for reheating or thawing
already cooked food. Yet 90 percent of new microwave food products
fail every year, he said, mainly because foods heat unevenly and
unappetizingly.
</P>
<P>
   In a conventionally heated oven, hot air cooks food from the
outside in, leading to crisp surfaces, like the skin on a
Thanksgiving turkey. Moreover, the hot air inside the oven is
uniformly hot, more or less, so the food cooks or thaws uniformly.
</P>
<P>
   But in a microwave oven, energy is used to heat the food itself
rather than the air. Moreover, there are pockets of lots of
microwave energy, some energy and none in the oven. By rotating the
food on a carousel, the energy is made a little more uniform, but
not much.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the uneven heating is the fact that the air in a
microwave oven is cool. When heated water migrates to the surface
of food, it stays there, instead of evaporating. French fries
become soggy, not crisp; mashed potatoes become a half-frozen,
half-lukewarm glop.
</P>
<P>
   Also, when water finally boils, its volume expands more than
1,500 times, cracking hard, non-porous surfaces. This is terrific
for popcorn, unattractive for potatoes and truly ugly for
hard-boiled eggs, whose hardened whites make for spectacular
splatters.
</P>
<P>
   Such heat-transfer effects can be described in standard
mathematical equations and then displayed in color on a computer
screen. Working with a graduate student, Hua Zhang, Datta
represented these heat effects in shades of blue for cold, red for
hot and yellow and green for in-between.
</P>
<P>
   In the model, the ham-and-gravy concoction of a TV dinner is red
at the edges, light blue in parts of the interior but dark blue, or
completely frozen, in the rest. The smaller mashed potato, pudding
and vegetable courses are just turning a splotchy yellow and green.
Nothing is just right.
</P>
<P>
   Datta hopes that food manufacturers, using his computer model,
can develop optimal sizes, shapes and materials for containers so
food will heat evenly. Curved egg shapes, for example, clearly
accelerate heating. As for aluminum foil, Datta has learned his
lesson.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Obscured by the debate over whether the Census
Bureau should use statistical sampling to supplement the next
national head count is a little secret: the ``actual enumeration''
mandated by the Constitution never really takes place.
</P>
<P>
   In the 2000 census, the bureau wants to count everyone who lives
in 90 per cent of the households in each of the country's census
tracts _ neighborhoods containing about 1,700 dwellings each _ and
use the data gathered from them to estimate the remaining 10 per
cent who haven't been located. It would then conduct a nationwide
survey of 750,000 households and use the results to adjust the
official figure up or down.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of sampling say it offends the Constitution, which
mandates an ``actual enumeration'' of the population every 10
years. Their criticism grew even louder last week after a federal
court in Washington said the Census Bureau's plans for using
sampling violated statutes governing how the count is to be
conducted.
</P>
<P>
   When the opponents of sampling say actual enumeration, they mean
just that. ``You have to go nose-by-nose, head-by-head,
neighborhood-by-neighborhood to count people,'' said Pete Jeffries,
spokesman for Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Such comments evoke a dreamy past in which clipboard-toting
census-takers troop through communities counting people one at a
time. But since the first census in 1790, the traditional head
count has been conducted in ways that belie that notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has never been a kind of line-up-everybody operation
where the U.S. Marshals or the census enumerators had to actually
see the people,'' said Margo J. Anderson, author of The American
Census: A Social History'' (Yale University Press, 1988).
</P>
<P>
   Conducted in a country that has always loathed heavy-handed
intrusion by its federal government, the census has instead relied
on the word of whoever in the household chooses to provide the
information. If that person gives erroneous information, for
whatever reasons _ personal, political, economic _ no one tries to
verify it.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, the Census Bureau moved even further away from the
original idea when it began to mail out census questionnaires, and
generally relied on the information that was sent back. With
mail-back forms, there are no government representatives noting
evidence _ bicycles stacked on the porch, raincoats hanging in the
hall _ that would look the information-giver in the eye and say,
``Are you sure you're the only one living here?''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense, it was a bigger change in census-taking to go from
enumerators going to every house to mailed questionnaires than
anything we're talking about now,'' said Barbara Everitt Bryant,
Director of the Census Bureau during the Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
   The fall off in the number of households that mail the
questionnaires back _ it dropped to 65 per cent in 1990 from 78 per
cent in 1970 _ is a prime reason the Census Bureau wants to change
its methods. In the 1990 census, counters went back again and again
to households that did not send back the form and to households
where no one was home when a census taker came calling. In some
cases, households were finally contacted as late as August, a major
reason why the 1990 Census had an estimated 26 million errors,
including people missed, people counted twice and people counted in
the wrong place.
</P>
<P>
   Since census tallies are used for allocating seats in the House
of Representative and drawing boundaries for legislative districts,
the Census Bureau has to find out not just how many people live in
a given neighborhood but how many people live there on the same
date, April 1 of the census year. Thus, information gathered in
August is barely relevant.
</P>
<P>
   And if a census-taker never is able to catch up to the occupants
of a household at all, he would ask landlords, neighbors,
shop-keepers, even people on the street _ measures that are closer
to guesses than actual enumeration.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau has even used a form of sampling to help fill
in data. In 1970 Census Bureau statisticians sent counters to a
sample of houses that were considered vacant and found that a
percentage of them were in fact occupied. This data were then used
to extrapolate how many people actually lived in the rest of the
nation's presumably vacant dwellings. As a result, a million people
were added.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of sampling say, though, that in the past, those were
measures of last resort. This is the first time the census
deliberately intends not to at least try to count everyone. What's
needed, they say, is for the Census Bureau to merely try harder.

<P>
   Put aside for a moment the frightening crash of the ruble and
the collapse of Russia's stock and bond markets last week. They are
symptoms of something larger _ a deformed economy in which the
government sets business taxes that few firms ever pay, enterprises
promise wages that employees never see, loans go unpaid, people
barter with pots, pans and socks and shady dealing runs rampant.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't have to be this way. The Russians need only look to
Poland to behold the better road untraveled. Poland too began the
decade saddled with paltry living standards bequeathed by a
sclerotic, centrally controlled economy run by discredited
Communists. It reached out to the West for help creating monetary,
budget, trade and legal regimes, and unlike Russia it followed
through with sustained political will. It now ranks among Europe's
fastest-growing economies.
</P>
<P>
   Key to Poland's steady success have been two policy decisions,
and discussing them helps to illuminate by contrast what is going
wrong in Russia.

   First, Poland adopted what might be called the Balcerowicz rule,
named after Leszek Balcerowicz, the finance minister who
masterminded Poland's market reforms. Balcerowicz invited thousands
of would-be entrepreneurs to sell, within loose limits, anything
they wanted anywhere they wanted at whatever price they wanted.
Economists called this liberalization. The Poles called it
competition.
</P>
<P>
   The Balcerowicz rule helped break the chokehold of
Communist-dominated, state-owned enterprises and government
bureaucracies over economic activity. Also, encouraging small
start-ups denies organized crime opportunities for large prey.
</P>
<P>
   When Poland broke away from communism, Western economists had
wrung their hands trying to figure out what to do with its
sprawling state-owned factories, which operated more like social
welfare agencies than production units. The solution, it turned
out, was benign neglect. Rather than convert factories, the Poles
allowed them to shrivel. Workers peeled away to set up retail shops
and other small enterprises largely free of government
interference.
</P>
<P>
   The second major decision was scarier. Poland forced insolvent
firms into bankruptcy, preventing them from draining resources from
productive parts of the economy. That also ended a drain on the
federal budget by firms that had to be propped up by one disguised
subsidy or another.
</P>
<P>
   There were moments when the post-Communist government in Russia
appeared headed in the same direction. In early 1992, the Yeltsin
government embraced the Balcerowicz rule. Russians were invited to
take to the streets and set up kiosks and curb-side tables, selling
whatever they wanted at whatever price consumers would pay.
</P>
<P>
   But then Communist antibodies, in the form of the oligarchs who
controlled the state-owned factories and natural resources, were
activated. They detected foreign tissue and attacked. Local
governments buried the Balcerowicz rule, imposing licensing and
other requirements and eventually strangling start-ups. Professor
Marshall Goldman of Harvard points to revealing comments by Viktor
Chernomyrdin, the off-again, on-again prime minister whom President
Boris Yeltsin restored to his post last week. Chernomyrdin observed
that street vendors were an unattractive, chaotic blight on a proud
country. The Russian authorities cracked down.
</P>
<P>
   The impact was severe. Anders Aslund, a former adviser to the
Russian government now at the Carnegie Endowment for International
Peace, estimates that since the middle of 1994, the number of
enterprises in Russia has stagnated. In a typical Western economy,
he estimates, there is 1 business for every 10 residents. In
Russia, the ratio is 1 for every 55.
</P>
<P>
   By snuffing out start-ups, Russia lost the remarkable device by
which Poland drained workers out of worthless factories into units
that could produce the goods that people wanted to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Russia not only stifles start-ups; it also props up
incompetents. It tolerates businesses that cannot pay taxes or
wages. They survive because of systems of barter and mutual
forbearance of loans and taxes. Suppliers engage in round-robin
lending by which everyone owes money to someone and no one ever
pays up. That too throws a lifeline to insolvent firms.
</P>
<P>
   Russian factories continue to churn out steel and other products
that no one needs. One measure of the deformity is that Russia is
littered with factories employing 10,000 or more workers. In the
United States, such factories are a rarity. The effect is to keep
alive concerns that chew up $1.50 worth of resources in order to
turn out a product that is worth only $1 to consumers. Economists
call this ``negative value added.'' Ordinary folk call it economic
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, of course, was not like Poland before or after
communism. History matters. Poland could let its relatively small
number of mega-factories wither, confident that workers could be
absorbed in fast-growing small enterprises. Russia's officials had
no such confidence about absorbing the workers from its numerous,
gigantic state-owned factories.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike communism in Poland, Soviet communism went back 70 years,
obliterating private property and extinguishing memory of a time
when ordinary people ran independent shops. There was also, Goldman
points out, a vibrant civic culture in Poland in the early 1990s
that equated the freedom of markets with freedom from the Soviets.
There was no such unambiguous response in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Clifford Gaddy of the Brookings Institution makes the point
that where start-ups were encouraged, namely Moscow, they thrived.
Still, when Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko in recent months
threatened to close down insolvent firms, the oligarchs rose up and
forced Yeltsin to drive his prime minister out of office. The
problem was not that Russia had no choices. It made the wrong ones.
</P>
<P>
   The West played a decisive role in Poland, but, it now appears,
not in Russia. Poland invited Western economists and investment
bankers to help design and execute its reform package. The West
also provided timely aid to smooth over the painful adjustment of
economic reconstruction. The Poles used the aid as promised, to pay
for bold reform.
</P>
<P>
   Russia too received Western aid. But, it now appears, the money
did more to postpone reforms than to provoke them. Over the years,
the West extracted grudging promises from the Russian government to
undertake this or that pro-market reform. The promises were never
fulfilled. Western money permitted the Russians to preserve
subsidies that keep the economy, such as it is, on life support.
</P>
<P>
   This too might have been otherwise. Early in Yeltsin's reign,
Professor Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard, a major architect of the Polish
reforms and a former Yeltsin adviser, organized a lobbying campaign
for a grand bargain, by which the West would provide substantial
aid early if Yeltsin would implement tough market reforms. The West
dithered and the moment was lost.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the bargain would have convinced the Russians to follow
the Poles' course rather than their own is unclear. But by the time
the West did crank up aid, the economy had foundered, people had
soured on reform and opponents of an economic overhaul had erected
high hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   Today Russia is paying the price. A government that clamped down
on reform in part because it produced chaotic, messy streets now
oversees an economy that is a chaotic mess.

<P>
   Put aside for a moment the frightening crash of the ruble and
the collapse of Russia's stock and bond markets last week. They are
symptoms of something larger _ a deformed economy in which the
government sets business taxes that few firms ever pay, enterprises
promise wages that employees never see, loans go unpaid, people
barter with pots, pans and socks and shady dealing runs rampant.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't have to be this way. The Russians need only look to
Poland to behold the better road untraveled. Poland too began the
decade saddled with paltry living standards bequeathed by a
sclerotic, centrally controlled economy run by discredited
Communists. It reached out to the West for help creating monetary,
budget, trade and legal regimes, and unlike Russia it followed
through with sustained political will. It now ranks among Europe's
fastest-growing economies.
</P>
<P>
   Key to Poland's steady success have been two policy decisions,
and discussing them helps to illuminate by contrast what is going
wrong in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   First, Poland adopted what might be called the Balcerowicz rule,
named after Leszek Balcerowicz, the finance minister who
masterminded Poland's market reforms. Balcerowicz invited thousands
of would-be entrepreneurs to sell, within loose limits, anything
they wanted anywhere they wanted at whatever price they wanted.
Economists called this liberalization. The Poles called it

</P>
<P>
   The Balcerowicz rule helped break the chokehold of
Communist-dominated, state-owned enterprises and government
bureaucracies over economic activity. Also, encouraging small
start-ups denies organized crime opportunities for large prey.

welfare agencies than production units. The solution, it turned
out, was benign neglect. Rather than convert factories, the Poles

   What does Diana, Princess of Wales, have in common with the
likes of Marilyn Monroe, James Dean, Albert Einstein and Babe Ruth?
A thriving afterlife as a brand name.
</P>
<P>
   While it is no longer unusual for celebrities to be
commercialized after their deaths, the rapid development of Diana
into a powerful merchandising phenomenon has been exceptional.
Dianabilia ranges from inexpensive trinkets like postcards and
T-shirts to moderately priced coins and stamps to expensive dolls
and plates.
</P>
<P>
   Those who possess, or profess to possess, more refined tastes
may scratch their heads in bewilderment. But the instant blanket
coverage of breaking news events now offered by global media helped
turn millions who never met Diana into souvenir hunters eager to
get something to remember her by.
</P>
<P>
   The scope of that media attention is being demonstrated again as
TV networks, magazines and newspapers mark Monday's first
anniversary of her death.
</P>
<P>
   Will the cottage industry that has grown up around Diana last?
Experts in building brands, licensing and merchandising believe it
could, particularly if her image is tended properly.
</P>
<P>
   It took some time after the death of Elvis Presley for big
demand to develop for products paying tribute to him. But the
shrewd management of his estate has meant that more than two
decades after his death, he may be a more regal king than he ever
was in life.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In August, after initialing the first treaty that his people had
ever concluded with Canada's government, Chief Joseph Gosnell Sr.
held the document over the seal whiskers of his regal headdress and
shouted, ``The Nisga'a canoe has returned.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a reference to a trip to the white man's capital taken by
his native American ancestors a century ago, and it was a way of
saying that the Nisga'a's long journey for recognition within
Canada was over.
</P>
<P>
   But the Nisga'a in fact have a long way to go, and in that they
are little different from other native Americans in Canada, Mexico
and the United States. For the treaty, which gives the Nisga'a
title to ancestral lands and the right to govern what goes on
there, still must be approved by Nisga'a members, the legislature
of British Columbia and the federal Parliament. It has already
raised objections from other Canadians about the special rights it
would give the Nisga'a.
</P>
<P>
   In fact the Nisga'a experience illustrates how much, across all
of North America, the original problem that European settlers faced
on their arrival in the new world remains largely unresolved. More
than 500 years later, Indians continue to demand recognition that
they have special rights to live a special way of life by virtue of
their having been in North America first.
</P>
<P>
   And this is more than a simple question of granting justice, as
the native Americans see it. Even where the political will exists
to grant such rights, governments and courts struggle to reconcile
the needs of Indian cultures with the concept of equality in the
constitutions of all three countries.
</P>
<P>
   It is a little like the basic political problem with affirmative
action programs: While the central goal of righting past wrongs
enjoys considerable support, the formulas being put forward are
under attack because they seem to grant special privileges to some,
but not all, citizens.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, for example, Indians in the state of Chiapas have
taken up arms to force the government to recognize Indian autonomy,
but officials worry that doing so too broadly could give Indians
rights not available to other Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   And in the United States, tribes are testing the boundaries of
their sovereignty by exploiting their land in ways that might not
be tolerated off the reservations.
</P>
<P>
   In the Canadian case, opponents object to the treaty because it
would allow elections limited by race. So they are preparing to
challenge the constitutionality of the Nisga'a treaty before the
precedent is followed by dozens of other Indian groups that are
also clamoring for self-government.
</P>
<P>
   Despite different histories and vastly unequal populations,
these issues all boil down to a demand to control Indian destiny by
controlling Indian land.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes Indians Indians is the dream of living on
communally held lands,'' said Jose Barreiro, associate director of
the American Indian Program at Cornell University, who has worked
and studied Indian groups across the American continent. ``The
issue of land is very, very strong in all indigenous communities.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of the land itself has been addressed, fairly or not,
in treaties or contracts signed over many years. Now the crux of
controversy in all three countries is the way Indians live on the
land. Although they travel in pick up trucks, wear jeans and use
the Internet, many Indians lead lives on their reserves and
reservations that are different from the societies around them.
</P>
<P>
   The 2,500 Nisga'a who live on their traditional lands are
divided into four bands, which correspond to four villages.
Patterns of leadership, land tenancy and even marriage are
determined to a large extent by participation in the bands.
</P>
<P>
   Some tribes have their own courts, their own methods of
punishment and their own preferred style of elections, which is not
always democratic. These patterns have persisted despite ferocious
attempts at assimilation through residential schools and laws that
banned traditional ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 30 years, the recognition of basic human rights
around the world has exposed injustices in the way Indians are
treated. In the United States, the civil rights movement focused
attention on Indians, and affirmative action gave a whole
generation of Indian students access to universities and law
schools. That generation of lawyers is now testing the limits of
Indian sovereignty, and the fight for greater independence is
sometimes financed by tax-free revenues from gambling operations.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, the government is still smarting from a violent
confrontation between soldiers and Mohawk Indians in 1990. A report
by the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples last year left no
doubt about how badly directed Canada's paternalistic handling of
Indians had been. Recent court decisions have upheld Indian claims
and even the legal validity of Indian oral histories.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Indians in Utah, claiming sovereign
powers, caused a panic with their plan to accept nuclear waste.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, where there are no reservations, the number of
full-blooded Indians is estimated to be around 10 million. Their
poverty is as extreme as their marginalization from the rest of
society. Much of the current tension can be traced to a
constitutional amendment in 1992 that essentially privatized Indian
land, which until then had been held by the community. The
government believed it was boosting Indian chances of entering the
modern economy but Indians have opposed the change. The Zapatista
uprising in Chiapas was based on issues of the land and Indian
rights.
</P>
<P>
   In negotiations with the Zapatistas, accords acknowledging
Indian autonomy were reached in January, 1996. But the government
recoiled at what the negotiators had given away. It was
particularly concerned that acknowledging the rights of ``the
Indian people'' as opposed to the more limited concept of ``Indian
communities,'' infringed on the sovereignty of Mexico and created
two classes of Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   The Zapatistas prefer to see themselves as part of a global
tribe of Indians. ``We have helped create, at the side of men and
women in the five continents, a great network,'' the Zapatista
leader, Marcos, wrote in the Indians' latest declaration from
Chiapas, ``a network that is fighting to build a new world.''

   Reno Orders Inquiry Into Gore Fund Raising
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno ordered a 90-day investigation to
determine whether to seek an independent prosecutor to examine Vice
President Al Gore's fund-raising telephone calls from the White
House during the 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Reno first examined Gore's solicitations last year, but absolved
him of wrongdoing, saying she could find no evidence that he knew
the money he raised was ``hard money'' to be spent on behalf of
specific candidates _ a use that Reno said could be illegal.
Federal officials are generally prohibited from raising such money
on government property.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the White House belatedly turned over a November 1995
memorandum with handwritten notations by a senior Gore aide that
suggested Gore could have known some of the contributions were for
the use of candidates.

   Limited Review Set For King Assassination
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years after Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated
on the balcony of a motel in Memphis, Attorney General Janet Reno
ordered a review of new evidence that raises questions about the
conviction of James Earl Ray as the sniper who alone killed the
civil rights leader.
</P>
<P>
   The review, which will be narrower than the full-scale reopening
of the case sought by King's family, will focus on claims like one
by Donald Wilson, a retired FBI agent, who said that after the
killing he found paper in Ray's car that bore the name Raoul. That
was the name of the shadowy figure who Ray, after recanting his
confession, claimed had manipulated him into the plot.
</P>
<P>
   But FBI officials said agents recently investigated Wilson's
claims and found them to be, as one agent put it, ``a total
fabrication.''

   Elusive Terrorist Reported Captured
</P>
<P>
   The elusive Abu Nidal, one of the world's most notorious
terrorists, who has eluded capture for nearly three decades,
appears to have fallen into the hands of Egyptian authorities as a
result of a spying scam.
</P>
<P>
   Despite official denials in Cairo, U.S. and Arab intelligence
officials said the 61-year-old Palestinian, whose real name is
Sabri Al Banna, was double-crossed in a murky spy-against-spy plot
after being used to identify Islamic fundamentalists plotting
terrorist acts in Egypt.

   Chinese Leaders Vow To Mend Ecological Ways
</P>
<P>
   In his heyday in the late 1950s, Mao Tse-tung called a mass
campaign to kill sparrows, accused of eating too much grain. The
result was disastrous as insect populations soared.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, awareness of ecology in China has changed, to say
the least. But it took this summer's disastrous floods and an
unusual public outcry to jolt the government into admitting past
mistakes and vowing sweeping changes in policy.

   As less-than-record rains caused record damage, China said it
would halt logging in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River system
and restore lakes and wetlands downstream that used to soak up
excess water, but were drained to make farms.
</P>
<P>
   Execution will not be easy, since the new policy threatens the
livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of loggers and farmers.

   Intel in Antitrust Probe
</P>
<P>
   The government's antitrust investigation of Microsoft has
widened to include the company's dealings with Intel, its
chip-making alter ego.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether Microsoft bullied Intel into backing away
from the development of new technology that conflicted with the
software giant's blueprint for the computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state investigators, Microsoft replies, are
misreading routine talks between business partners.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Microsoft say the Intel inquiries seem to be a
last-minute effort by the Justice Department and 20 states to
strengthen their slender case, which is scheduled to go to trial
Sept. 23.

   Mother Teresa Workers Killed by Serbs
</P>
<P>
   Three Albanians working for the Mother Teresa aid organization
were killed by cannon fire in Serbia in what appeared to be a
government effort to terrorize aid workers.
</P>
<P>
   The three were hit as they rode on tractors pulling wagons
loaded with supplies for refugees who had fled a government
military offensive in the province of Kosovo. The wagons carried
food and white boxes with large blue circles bearing the name of
the donor, Doctors of the World.
</P>
<P>
   The government said the police, riding in an armored personnel
carrier, could not see what was in the wagons and opened fire.

   U.S. Trial for Bomb Suspects
</P>
<P>
   Two suspects in the bombings of U.S. Embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania were brought to the United States to be tried on charges
stemming from the Aug. 7 blasts, in which more than 250 people died
and more than 5,000 were injured. Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali
and Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, are to be tried in federal court in New
York City, where Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has ordered increased
security.

   American Quits Iraq Inspection Team
</P>
<P>
   After months of agonizing, William Ritter, the longest-serving
American weapons inspector in Iraq, resigned to protest what he
called the ``surrender to Iraqi leadership'' by the Clinton
administration and the United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   He said the U.N. Special Commission for which he worked had been
on the ``doorstep'' of uncovering new information about Iraq's
hidden weapons programs when the administration helped stymie an
August inspection. The administration praised him, but defended its
approach toward containing Saddam Hussein. &QL;

   Libyans May Be Tried In Lockerbie Crash
</P>
<P>
   After 10 years of grief for the families of the dead of Pan Am
103, blown up over Lockerbie, Scotland, there was some promise of
justice.
</P>
<P>
   Libya signaled its cautious acceptance of an American and
British plan _ first suggested by Tripoli _ to try the two Libyan
suspects in a Scottish court, but with Scottish judges instead of a
jury, and in a neutral third country, the Netherlands. Libya wants
sanctions lifted, but is considered likely to delay handing over
the two men, both intelligence agents.

   Carcinogen Found in Fetuses of Pregnant Smokers
</P>
<P>
   Researchers reported the first direct evidence that a
cancer-causing substance from tobacco is transmitted to fetuses by
pregnant smokers. Dr. Stephen Hecht of the University of Minnesota
Cancer Center said his findings established that the
nicotine-derived chemical NNK is not only received by the fetus but
processed by the body.
</P>
<P>
   The study, sponsored by the National Cancer Institute, did not
determine whether the infants with the traces of NNK byproducts in
their urine were at greater risk of developing cancer, but Hecht
called the finding an unacceptable risk.

<P>
   By Hemingway, One Last Time
</P>
<P>
   ``In your novels, are you writing about yourself?'' a student
once asked Ernest Hemingway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does a writer know anyone better?'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   But now in a final, posthumous novel to be published next year
for the centennial of his birth, the adventurer and prankster who
was Hemingway can keep readers guessing. The book, ``True at First
Light,'' an unfinished fictional memoir based on a 1953 safari to
Kenya with his fourth wife, Mary, weaves in the story of Debba, an
18-year-old girl of the Wakamba tribe whom the narrator woos, weds
and beds _ cheered on by his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Is it true? Patrick Hemingway, the author's 70-year-old son, who
carved the 100,000-word book out of a 200,000-word manuscript for
Scribner, said he joined the safari from his farm in Tanganyika and
saw no Debba. Nor apparently did the photographer for Look
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Yet both Hemingway and Mary later tantalized biographers with
tales of a romance. A.E. Hotchner even quoted Hemingway's account
of three-way nuptials that included his bride's widowed 17-year-old
sister.
</P>
<P>
   But the book, portions of which were excerpted by Sports
Illustrated in the 1970s, ranges far beyond the love triangle.
There are autobiographical flashbacks, meditations on the soul and
suspenseful hunts. This much at least is true: Mary gets her lion.
Its skin adorns the floor of the Hemingway Room in the John F.
Kennedy Library in Boston.

   I'll Take the Diana Bath Mat
</P>
<P>
   What does Diana, Princess of Wales, have in common with the
likes of Marilyn Monroe, James Dean, Albert Einstein and Babe Ruth?
A thriving afterlife as a brand name.
</P>
<P>
   While it is no longer unusual for celebrities to be
commercialized after their deaths, the rapid development of Diana
into a powerful merchandising phenomenon has been exceptional.
Dianabilia ranges from inexpensive trinkets like postcards and
T-shirts to moderately priced coins and stamps to expensive dolls
and plates.
</P>
<P>
   Those who possess, or profess to possess, more refined tastes
may scratch their heads in bewilderment. But the instant blanket
coverage of breaking news events now offered by global media helped
turn millions who never met Diana into souvenir hunters eager to
get something to remember her by.
</P>
<P>
   The scope of that media attention is being demonstrated again as
TV networks, magazines and newspapers mark Monday's anniversary of
her death.
</P>
<P>
   Will the cottage industry that has grown up around Diana last?
Experts in building brands, licensing and merchandising believe it
could, particularly if her image is tended properly.
</P>
<P>
   It took some time after the death of Elvis Presley for big
demand to develop for products paying tribute to him. But the
shrewd management of his estate has meant that more than two
decades after his death, he may be a more regal king than he ever
was in life.

   RUSSIA PACKAGE
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-SUMMIT (Washington) _ President Clinton plans to depart
for Moscow on Monday hoping to repair his scandal-stained image
while offering comfort _ but no aid _ for the wounded President of
Russia, Boris N. Yeltsin. By John M. Broder.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-REASSURE (Moscow) _ With President Clinton's arrival for
a summit meeting just days away, Russia's ad-hoc leadership sought
to telegraph a message of stability Saturday, saying neither
economic crisis nor political bargaining with Communist legislators
presages a return to Soviet-style fiscal policy. By Michael Wines.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-YUPPIES (Moscow) _ These are dizzy days for Moscow's
yuppies, who have grown used to big salaries, often paid in
dollars, from the banks, foreign firms, real estate companies and
other businesses that rode the wave of the capital's recent boom
years. Many of these people are so young that they have known
nothing but well-paid, white-collar jobs. By Celestine Bohlen.

   RUSSIA-SUMMIT-ADVICE (Washington) _ Henry Kissinger, Brent
Scowcroft, Colin Powell and Zbigniew Brzezinski hold forth on the

   RUSSIA-GERMANY (Frankfurt, Germany) _ Locked in a tight national
election campaign, German political leaders are coldly reappraising
their longstanding willingness to bankroll Russia and to support
its president, Boris Yeltsin. By Edmund L. Andrews.

<P>
   OTHER INTERNATIONAL NEWS
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY-POLITICS (Berlin) _ Wolfgang Schaeuble is a man in a
hurry for change, and all that stands between him and a chance to
take power in Europe's richest nation is the lowering bulk of his
mentor, Chancellor Helmut Kohl. By Alan Cowell.
</P>
<P>
   INDIA-TEMPLE (Ayodhya, India) _ The crusade for a temple to Ram
here in Ayodhya on the very place where a mosque once stood has
been central to the political ascendancy of the Hindu nationalist
Bharatiya Janata Party, which now leads the Indian government. And
it has posed one of the gravest challenges ever to modern India's
50-year tradition as a secular nation committed to treating people
of all faiths justly. By Celia W. Dugger.
</P>
<P>
   PAKISTAN-TURMOIL (Islamabad, Pakistan) _ During such a
tumultuous week, it might be expected that people here were
preoccupied by the American missile attack in neighboring
Afghanistan. But this is not the case, for people in this country
have concerns far more immediate. The world's newest nuclear power
also has one of the world's worst credit ratings, and with the
possibility of default looming on its $30 billion foreign debt,
Pakistan's economy is quickly coming unspooled. By Barry Bearak.

   DIANA-PARIS (Paris) _ The City of Paris decided last week to bow

</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-POLITICS (Mexico City) _ The exhilaration of ending the
governing party's 68-year reign in the lower house of Mexico's
Congress was still fresh as members of the new opposition majority
got down to business last September. But the celebration did not
last long. By Anthony DePalma.

   PILOT-STRIKE (Minneapolis) _ More than 6,000 pilots began a

stems from a history of mistrust between management and labor in
the airline industry and two contradictory fears of the future. By
Laurence Zuckerman.
</P>
<P>
   PILOT-STRIKE-CLINTON (Edgartown, Mass.) _ President Clinton
refused early Saturday morning to intervene in the Northwest
Airlines pilots' strike, urging both sides to iron out their
differences on their own. By Katharine Q. Seelye.
</P>
<P>
   PILOT-STRIKE-VICTIMS _ Passengers booked on Northwest Airlines
flights are facing serious disruptions and delays because of the
pilots' strike against the carrier. Many may be unable to get
alternative flights, even to get home, until after the strike. By
Edwin McDowell.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-DEPRESSION _ In the first concentrated study of the
social and psychological effects of Internet use at home,
researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have found that people
who spend even a few hours a week on line experience higher levels
of depression and loneliness than they would have if they used the
computer network less frequently. By Amy Harmon.
</P>
<P>
   COLO-MASSACRE-SITE (Chivington, Colo.) _ One historian calls it
the American My Lai. But, 134 years after 700 U.S. Army volunteers
stormed through an Indian encampment near here on the Big Sandy
Creek, slaughtering scores of women and children, Colorado's
killing fields have disappeared into the swirling dust and endless
horizons of big sky country. By James Brooke.
</P>
<P>
   MASS-MIRACLEGIRL (Worcester, Mass.) _ Audrey Santo has been
bedridden for 11 years, in a condition that leaves her inert and
unspeaking, the legacy of an accidental fall into a backyard
swimming pool. But because some who have visited here claimed to
have been cured of illnesses, she is said by her family _ and by a
growing number of devotees _ to be a mystic and a ``victim soul''
who takes on the suffering of people who ask her to intercede with
God, relaying their pleas for healing. By Gustav Niebuhr.
</P>
<P>
   FAA-REBUKE (Washington) _ Aviation experts often blame
mechanical problems or pilot error for crashes. Last week the
National Transportation Safety Board blamed regulatory error by the
Federal Aviation Administration. By Matthew L. Wald.

<P>
   WASHINGTON (Moving in ``w'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   BUDGET-SURPLUS (Washington) _ While booming stock prices
contributed importantly to the government's now-certain budget
surplus for 1998 _ the first in almost 30 years _ the market's
recent swoon poses little threat so far to the nation's hard-won
return to fiscal integrity. By Robert D. Hershey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-STARR (Washington) _ In the two weeks since President
Clinton acknowledged having had an inappropriate relationship with
Monica Lewinsky, the capital's attention has been riveted by the
prospect of an impeachment report that official Washington assumes
independent counsel Kenneth Starr will send to the House of
Representatives. Never mind that Starr has not even said that his
prosecutors are writing a report. By Don Van Natta Jr.
</P>
<P>
   NEA-REVIVAL (Washington) _ In the days since the House voted to
spare the National Endowment for the Arts, and made clear that the
stay of execution was more or less permanent, the new chairman of
the agency has begun talking out loud about all that suddenly seems
possible: more money, less rancor, even ``a New Deal without the
Depression, with murals painted all over the country and music
composed.'' By Melinda Henneberger.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ By last Monday , the owner of Shury-Mury, a popular
downtown Moscow restaurant that offers a country atmosphere and
Russian cuisine, had made his decision: his prices would have to go
up.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he changed the menus Friday, the cost of his blini
filled with red caviar and baked sturgeon had shot up by 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Already for a week, we had been working at a loss,'' said
Vadim Nikitin, 29, who in these times of trouble has taken to
watching two hours of television news every night, anxiously
scanning the airwaves for information that will help him figure out
which way his country is going, and what its currency is worth.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, before the de facto devaluation of the ruble and
the subsequent reshuffling of the Russian government, one dollar
equaled 6.2 rubles. Now it is worth pretty much what anybody says _
from 10 rubles at some currency exchange booths, to 20 rubles on an
incipient black market, to 11, the rate set Friday after brief
trading on an electronic inter-bank exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Nikitin's problem _ shared by virtually all restaurateurs who
have built businesses on Moscow's bubble economy _ is that much of
the food he feeds his customers comes not from the Russian
countryside but from abroad. And while he was hesitating about how
much to charge for his dishes, his suppliers were not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sturgeon was 50 to 60 rubles a kilo last week, today it is 100
rubles, and that is the wholesale price,'' Nikitin said.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger problem was his deliveries of imported alcohol, which
ground to a halt last week as wholesalers sat on their cases,
waiting to figure out their value in Russia's fast-evaporating
currency.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he pays his employees in rubles, their salaries _
like his rent _ are pegged to the dollar, a hangover from the
turbulent days of Russia's triple-digit inflation in the early
1990s, a habit that lingered on long after the ruble reached stable
levels in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   Larissa, as an employee at the Moscow office of a multinational
company, also earns dollars. That's good news, given the way the
ruble went last week. The bad news is that she cannot draw dollars
from the debit card her employer uses to pay employees' salaries.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Larissa, who asked not to be identified by her last
name, did not even go near her bank all week, not after a colleague
showed up late at work one day, with a tale of woe heard all across
this dollar-infected city.
</P>
<P>
   The young woman had gone to her bank at 6 a.m., where she was
the 41st person to sign up on the day's waiting list.
</P>
<P>
   At noon, the bank manager appeared to tell the crowd that there
would be no dollars, only rubles at the fictitious rate of 7.8, an
official level that has remained on the books since Moscow's
interbank currency exchange shut down for business last Wednesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are taking rubles in small quantities, some
managed to take out their dollars before this whole thing began,''
Larissa said. ``I have decided to wait and see what happens.'' She
said the company has said that on Monday, it will pay salaries in
rubles _ at 9.5 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   These are dizzy days for Moscow's yuppies, who have grown used
to big salaries, often paid in dollars, from the banks, foreign
firms, real estate companies and other businesses that rode the
wave of the capital's recent boom years. Many of these people are
so young that they have known nothing but well-paid, white-collar
jobs. Aleksei Smirnov, a 19-year-old real estate broker, stood in
line at a currency office Friday with a fistful of dollars, which
he wanted to trade at a rate of 12 rubles to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   His first reaction when the ruble collapsed was to go the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any money in the bank, so we avoided that
problem,'' he said, as he waited in line with his girlfriend
Natasha Kolucheva, 18. ``We have our money under the mattresses.
Natasha has several thousand, I have a bit less.''
</P>
<P>
   But as luck would have it, when their turn came to go into the
bank, the teller had run out of rubles, and the couple went looking
for other ways to get enough rubles to get through the coming week.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-week last week, Moscow was in a mad spending spree.
``People were buying everything,'' said Aras Agalarov, president of
Crocus International, which owns a chain of 70 stores across the
city, from a giant household store on the outskirts to chic
boutiques scattered around the center.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his competitors in the luxury goods business simply shut
their doors last week, hanging out signs that said things like
``closed for technical reasons,'' or ``closed for inventory,''
which as excuses go, were not too far off the mark: they were in
fact waiting to see which way the ruble will jump, whether to raise
their prices by 10, 20 or 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Agalarov, who is also vice president of the Moscow International
Business Association, chose another route. He stayed open, and sold
at his old prices _ which brought a wave of customers, buying at
twice their normal rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like having a big sale,'' Agalarov said. ``It was the
end of the season anyway, so we already had marked goods down by 30
percent. The government just went and added another 50 or 70
percent to the discount, that's all.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Cars, real estate, washing machines, jewelry, stereos _
everything was getting swept by splurge spenders looking for ways
to park their money before the ruble goes down any further. The
giant AvtoVAZ factory in Togliatti, in southern Russia, reported it
had emptied its inventory of the latest model of Zhiguli, the
FIAT-lookalike that had been the staple of the Russian car market,
before the recent flood of imports.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate brokers in Moscow reported a rush of buyers, looking
to snap up new apartments and small dachas, or country houses, at
something approaching old prices. In fact, according to newspaper
reports, real estate prices have already edged upward 25 percent in
Russian ruble terms, and where they will land at the time buyers
sign their contracts is anybody's guess. ``Few people have enough
money in their mattresses to buy an apartment,'' noted the
newspaper Moskovsky Komsolets, adding that without access to bank
accounts, it will be a while before anybody has the cash to
conclude any deals made over the past chaotic week.
</P>
<P>
   Like other retailers, Alexander Silvanovich, the 29-year-old
director of Everything for the Home, a small household goods store
in central Moscow, has been told repeatedly by his suppliers to
forget bank transfers. With the Russian banking system now in
gridlock, everybody wants cash up front, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we are only buying domestic goods,'' he said, in
between calls on his mobile phone. ``The prices on them have gone
up 10 to 15 percent, but we are trying to hold down our prices,
which means our profits are dropping 10 to 15 percent. Everyone is
in shock. So are we.''
</P>
<P>
   Silvanovich had been planning a renovation of the store, located
on the first floor of an old building. Now he has put it off.
</P>
<P>
   Nikitin is also finding that price rises are complicating his
plans to open a second restaurant. ``Now we can't buy some of the
necessary appliances we need,'' Nikitin said. ``I made calls on
Monday, but no one is selling, or they are selling at 15 to the
dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   For Alik Guseinov, a 36-year-old flower vendor from Azerbaijan,
the problem is that his roses, some imported from Holland, some
grown locally, do not last more than three days. So people, out
searching for more durable goods, are walking right past his stand
outside a subway stop, even though he is now selling the roses at
their wholesale price.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are buying less,'' he said. ``They don't complain about
the prices since we haven't raised them. But we know it's hard for
people. They aren't getting paid, or they can't get their money
from bank. If we raise our prices, no one will buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyudmila Kazmina, 72, lives mainly off the pension she receives
as a former high-placed administrator in the Soviet state film
commission.
</P>
<P>
   But every day, she sets up a table on the sidewalk, selling a
hodgepodge of items from romance novels to Orthodox church
calendars to help out her daughter, Lena Orfani, 42, who lost a job
as an editor in the documentary film division.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, they were celebrating Lena's birthday but the dishes
on their table this year were modest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I invited my friends of course, but I have to say that every
year it is more humble,'' Mrs. Orfani said. ``Now everything is
more expensive.'' &QL;

A SAD, LONELY WORLD IS DISCOVERED IN CYBERSPACE, SURPRISING
RESEARCHERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By AMY HARMON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the first concentrated study of the social and psychological
effects of Internet use at home, researchers at Carnegie Mellon
University have found that people who spend even a few hours a week
on line experience higher levels of depression and loneliness than
they would have if they used the computer network less frequently.
</P>
<P>
   Those participants who were lonelier and more depressed at the
start of the two-year study, as determined by a standard
questionnaire administered to all the subjects, were not more
likely to use the Internet. Instead, Internet use itself appeared
to cause a decline in psychological well-being, the researchers
said.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the $1.5 million project ran completely contrary
to expectations of the social scientists who designed it and to
many of the organizations that financed the study. These included
technology companies like Intel Corp., Hewlett Packard, AT&AMP;T
Research and Apple Computer, as well as the National Science
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were shocked by the findings, because they are
counterintuitive to what we know about how socially the Internet is
being used,'' said Robert Kraut, a social psychology professor at
Carnegie Mellon's Human Computer Interaction Institute. ``We are
not talking here about the extremes. These were normal adults and
their families, and on average, for those who used the Internet
most, things got worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has been praised as superior to television and
other ``passive'' media because it allows users to choose the kind
of information they want to receive, and often, to respond actively
to it in the form of e-mail exchanges with other users, chat rooms
or electronic bulletin board postings.
</P>
<P>
   Research on the effects of watching television indicates that it
tends to reduce social involvement. But the new study, titled
``HomeNet,'' suggests that the interactive medium may be no more
socially healthy than older mass media. It also raises troubling
questions about the nature of ``virtual'' communication and the
disembodied relationships that are often formed in the vacuum of
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Participants in the study used inherently social features like
e-mail and Internet chat more than they used passive information
gathering like reading or watching videos. But they reported a
decline in interaction with family members and a reduction in their
circles of friends that directly corresponded to the amount of time
they spent on line.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning and end of the two-year study, the subjects
were asked to agree or disagree with statements like ``I felt
everything I did was an effort,'' and ``I enjoyed life'' and ``I
can find companionship when I want it.'' They were also asked to
estimate how many minutes each day they spent with each member of
their family and to quantify their social circle. Many of these are
standard questions in tests used to determine psychological health.
</P>
<P>
   For the duration of the study, the subjects' use of the Internet
was recorded. For the purposes of this study, depression and
loneliness were measured independently, and each subject was rated
on a subjective scale. In measuring depression, the responses were
plotted on a scale of 0 to 3, with 0 being the least depressed and
3 being the most depressed. Loneliness was plotted on a scale of 1
to 5.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the study, the researchers found that one hour a
week on the Internet led, on average, to an increase of .03, or 1
percent, on the depression scale, a loss of 2.7 members of the
subject's social circle, which averaged 66 people, and an increase
of .02, or four-tenths of 1 percent, on the loneliness scale.
</P>
<P>
   The subjects exhibited wide variations in all three measured
effects, and while the net effects were not large, they were
statistically significant in demonstrating deterioration of social
and psychological life, Kraut said.
</P>
<P>
   Based on these data, the researchers hypothesize that
relationships maintained over long distances without face-to-face
contact ultimately do not provide the kind of support and
reciprocity that typically contribute to a sense of psychological
security and happiness, like being available to baby-sit in a pinch
for a friend, or to grab a cup of coffee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hypothesis is there are more cases where you're building
shallow relationships, leading to an overall decline in feeling of
connection to other people,'' Kraut said.
</P>
<P>
   The study tracked the behavior of 169 participants in the
Pittsburgh area who were selected from four schools and community
groups. Half the group was measured through two years of Internet
use, and the other half for one year. The findings will be
published this week by The American Psychologist, the peer-reviewed
monthly journal of the American Psychological Association.
</P>
<P>
   Because the study participants were not randomly selected, it is
unclear how the findings apply to the general population. It is
also conceivable that some unmeasured factor caused simultaneous
increases in use of the Internet and decline in normal levels of
social involvement. Moreover, the effect of Internet use varied
depending on an individual's life patterns and type of use.
Researchers said that people who were isolated because of their
geography or work shifts might have benefited socially from
Internet use.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, several social scientists familiar with the study
vouched for its credibility and predicted that the findings would
probably touch off a national debate over how public policy on the
Internet should evolve and how the technology itself might be
shaped to yield more beneficial effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did an extremely careful scientific study, and it's not a
result that's easily ignored,'' said Tora Bikson, a senior
scientist at Rand, the research institution. Based in part on
previous studies that focused on how local communities like Santa
Monica, Calif., used computer networks to enhance civic
participation, Rand has recommended that the federal government
provide e-mail access to all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not clear what the underlying psychological explanation
is,'' Ms. Bikson said of the study. ``Is it because people give up
day-to-day contact and then find themselves depressed? Or are they
exposed to the broader world of Internet and then wonder, `What am
I doing here in Pittsburgh?' Maybe your comparison standard
changes. I'd like to see this replicated on a larger scale. Then
I'd really worry.''

<P>
   Christine Riley, a psychologist at Intel Corp., the giant chip
manufacturer that was among the sponsors of the study, said she was
surprised by the results but did not consider the research
definitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, the point is there was really no information on this
before,'' Ms. Riley said. ``But it's important to remember this is
not about the technology, per se; it's about how it is used. It
really points to the need for considering social factors in terms
of how you design applications and services for technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The Carnegie Mellon team _ which included Sara Kiesler, a social
psychologist who helped pioneer the study of human interaction over
computer networks; Tridas Mukophadhyay, a professor at the graduate
business school who has examined computer mediated communication in
the workplace; and William Scherlis, a research scientist in
computer science _ stressed that the negative effects of Internet
use that they found were not inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the main focus of Internet use in schools has been
gathering information and getting in touch with people from
far-away places. But the research suggests that maintaining social
ties with people in close physical proximity could be more
psychologically healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``More intense development and deployment of services that
support pre-existing communities and strong relationships should be
encouraged,'' the researchers write in their forthcoming article.
``Government efforts to wire the nation's schools, for example,
should consider online homework sessions for students rather than
just online reference works.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when Internet use is expanding rapidly _ nearly 70
million adult Americans are on line, according to Nielsen Media
Research _ social critics say the technology could exacerbate the
fragmentation of U.S. society or help to fuse it, depending on how
it is used.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two things the Internet can turn out to be, and we
don't know yet which it's going to be,'' said Robert Putnam, a
political scientist at Harvard University whose forthcoming book,
``Bowling Alone,'' which is to be published next year by Simon &AMP;
Schuster, chronicles the alienation of Americans from each other
since the 1960s. ``The fact that I'm able to communicate daily with
my collaborators in Germany and Japan makes me more efficient, but
there are a lot of things it can't do, like bring me chicken
soup.''
</P>
<P>
   Putnam added, ``The question is how can you push computer
mediated communication in a direction that would make it more
community friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps paradoxically, several participants in the Internet
study expressed surprise when they were informed of the study's
conclusions by a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me it's been the opposite of depression; it's been a way
of being connected,'' said Rabbi Alvin Berkun, who used the
Internet for a few hours a week to read The Jerusalem Post and
communicate with other rabbis across the country.
</P>
<P>
   But Berkun said his wife did not share his enthusiasm for the
medium. ``She does sometimes resent when I go and hook up,'' he
said, adding after a pause, ``I guess I am away from where my
family is while I'm on the computer.'' Another possibility is that
the natural human preference for face-to-face communication may
provide a self-correcting mechanism to the technology that tries to
cross it.
</P>
<P>
   The rabbi's daughter, Rebecca, 17, said she had spent a fair
amount of time in teen-age chat rooms at the beginning of the
survey in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see how people would get depressed,'' Ms. Berkun said.
``When we first got it, I would be on for an hour a day or more.
But I found it was the same type of people, the same type of things
being said. It got kind of old.''

BAD TIMING, BUT CLINTON TO MEET YELTSIN IN SHOW OF SUPPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also RUSSIA-SUMMIT-ADVICE, RUSSIA-GERMANY, RUSSIA-REASSURE.) 
(nk) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton plans to depart for Moscow on
Monday hoping to repair his scandal-stained image while offering
comfort _ but no aid _ for the wounded president of Russia, Boris
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Not since 1974 has a U.S. president gone to Moscow in such a
weak domestic position. President Richard M. Nixon met with Soviet
leader Leonid Brezhnev in late June of that year as the final
chapters of the Watergate scandal were unfolding. The summit
meeting gave a fleeting impression of an active president engaged
in the international arena, but nothing of substance was
accomplished. Five weeks after returning to Washington, Nixon
resigned in disgrace.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton beset by the Monica Lewinsky matter and a sickly
Yeltsin struggling to manage a country in political and financial
chaos, few expect substantial progress to be made on any items on
the meeting agenda _ arms control, terrorism, regional conflicts
and the global economy. The meeting may, however, give each leader
a 48-hour respite from their howling constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bad timing and poor prospects of the Moscow meeting,
administration officials insist that it is in America's interest
that Clinton proceed. Administration officials discussed throughout
this tumultuous week postponing or canceling the summit meeting _
before unanimously agreeing on Friday that it should go forward.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Friday that he owed it to his beleaguered
counterpart to lend moral support in ``this dark night.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody can come see you when you're doing well,'' the
president said.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Berger, the president's national security adviser,
elaborated on the reasons Clinton felt it necessary to go to Moscow
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important that he go on this trip despite the situation
_ or perhaps, even more _ because of the situation in Russia,''
Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the president would convey to Yeltsin the
importance that the United States puts on the relationship with
Russia and give assurance that ``particularly in times of
difficulty, the United States and the West will not turn away from
cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   And he said that critical work remains to be done on assuring
the safety of Russia's nuclear arsenal, on controlling the spread
of weapons, on Kosovo and Iraq. The leaders are expected to
announce agreements on reducing Russia's stockpile of bomb-grade
plutonium and sharing early-warning data on missile launches from
third countries, particularly in the arc of instability from Iran
through South Asia to North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``America has a strong interest in preventing Russia from
backsliding and in promoting its stability and success,'' Berger
said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said there was no substitute for visiting Moscow
and sitting across the table from Yeltsin to judge his political
and physical health. Clinton and Yeltsin held their last formal
summit meeting in March 1997, in Helsinki, Finland, though they
have met briefly in private twice since then during larger
gatherings of the top industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton carries two messages to Moscow, neither of which is
likely to be warmly received by all audiences. One is that while
the United States is sympathetic to Russia's current economic
plight, it has little to offer unless the yet-unformed government
of Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin adopts painful
short-term measures to raise taxes, battle corruption and control
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is their success in carrying out these steps that we
believe will be crucial in determining their economic prospects in
what is not an easy global economic environment,'' said Deputy
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers. But he said, ``Russia's
economic future will be shaped in Russia by Russian policy choices
going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The other is that while the West has to do business with Yeltsin
as the elected president of Russia, Clinton and other world leaders
are looking beyond him to a new generation of reform-minded leaders
willing to make a decisive break with Russia's Communist past. The
centerpiece of the trip, from the U.S. standpoint, is a speech
Clinton is to give to students and young community and business
leaders at the Moscow Institute of International Relations on
Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   It is an open question whether those leaders have any hope of
achieving real power under Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin, who have given
mixed signs about their willingness to accept Western-dictated
economic measures or to work with those who advocate them.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's advisers say they believe that canceling the summit
meeting would do more harm than good, delivering a devastating vote
of no confidence in Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin just as they are
trying to cobble together a government.
</P>
<P>
   But many believe the timing is atrocious because critical
government posts are empty and there is no set of policies to
discuss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is overjoyed at the timing,'' said one senior
administration policy-maker. ``There is no plan and there are no
people. We're reduced on the policy side here to having
hypothetical discussions on what one might do if there were a
certain type of government.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if there's a silver lining, it's that you don't have to
answer all the hard questions because virtually every hard question
is premature.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The chief danger of holding the summit meeting now is that it
will give the illusion of stability in the relationship and the
possibility of progress down the road when little is possible, some
Russia scholars contend.
</P>
<P>
   James Goldgeier, a Russia specialist at George Washington
University, said that, in the ideal, summit meetings are where
leaders make promises and then deliver on them. But neither
president is in a position to do so, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have got a summit in which the main political aspect is
that you have two presidents who are extremely weak domestically,
each of whom has a legislature that isn't in much of a mood to give
them anything,'' Goldgeier said. ``You've got elites in both
capitals calling for each president to step down, and again that's
not helpful as you approach a summit. You've got investors fleeing
Russia. You've got social unrest growing. And so the Bill and Boris
Show is not a particularly compelling spectacle as we approach
Sept. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will stop in Northern Ireland and Ireland for three days
after the Moscow meeting to celebrate the signing of the
U.S.-brokered peace accord this spring and to preach reconciliation
between the British province's warring factions.
</P>
<P>
   He will meet with Catholic and Protestant leaders, visit Omagh,
site of a car bombing Aug. 15 that killed 29 people and deliver
several speeches to the Irish people. The White House hopes he will
be met by spirit-lifting huge crowds, like those he encountered
during his first visit to Ireland, in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's five-day trip will end with a round of golf on the
storied links at Ballybunion, in southwest Ireland. He will return
to Washington on Saturday evening.

STOCK MARKET RETREAT NOT EXPECTED TO SPOIL BUDGET SURPLUS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While booming stock prices contributed importantly
to the government's now-certain budget surplus for 1998 _ the first
in almost 30 years _ the market's recent swoon poses little threat
so far to the nation's hard-won return to fiscal integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, economists and budget specialists say, the many
investors who frantically or more deliberately decided to cash in
some stock winnings will swell the surplus even further, at least
for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``As people are pulling out, they're having to take capital
gains that have been built up,'' said James Glassman, managing
director of Chase Securities in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the job and wage gains of a surging economy as well
as soaring stock prices, the government has repeatedly scrambled to
raise its budgetary sights, with the Congressional Budget Office
now projecting that federal revenue will exceed spending by $63
billion for the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-controlled Congress and the Clinton White House
have pounced on this largely unforeseen surplus _ the
administration's first estimate early last year was for a deficit
of $121 billion _ to press, respectively, for tax cuts or for
partial mending of Social Security, among other programs.
</P>
<P>
   After the Congressional Budget Office in July more than doubled
its projection of the surplus over the next 10 years, Republicans
said the government could afford to do both.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say the additional revenue resulting from months of
cashing in of stock profits _ most issues retreated well before the
August dive of blue chips _ will only marginally affect the budget
debate unless the stock market drops enough to help tip the
now-slowing economy into recession. This is a prospect that has
become less remote in recent weeks, but is still considered
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this correction is going to have any measurable
impact on the rate of economic growth,'' said Lawrence Kudlow,
chief economist at American Skandia Life Assurance in Shelton,
Conn., who served in the Office of Management and Budget in the
Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   When recessions do occur _ the latest being a mild, eight-month
one that ended in 1991 _ they shrink revenue and raise spending for
unemployment and other benefits.
</P>
<P>
   And while stock prices have been designated an official
predictive indicator of the economy's course, recessions have
sometimes humbled the most sophisticated forecasters. In the summer
of 1990, for example, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal
Reserve Board, said he saw no recession on the horizon, but it
turned out that the economy had already entered one.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Kies, a former staff chief at the Congressional Joint
Committee on Taxation and now a managing partner at Price
WaterhouseCoopers, said the market would have a minimal effect on
the budget unless the market dropped enough to force the government
to cut back its long-term projections for economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   But Kies also said that shrinking stock values and the lower tax
receipts associated with them would allow Republicans in Congress
to argue that it would be less costly to make further cuts in the
tax bite on capital gains and on estates.
</P>
<P>
   In a somewhat perverse twist, Kudlow contended that one largely
unrecognized factor in the current meltdown of stock prices was the
enactment this summer of a reduction in the holding period for
preferential capital gains tax treatment, to 12 months from 18
months.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Reischauer, who headed the Congressional Budget Office
from 1989 to 1995, said the government would probably enjoy a
temporary, modest rise in taxes from capital gains, but the amount
could not be quantified. ``It's a difficult call,'' he said,
``because a lot depends on who's selling'' _ the combination of
small investors with years of profit buildup and professionals
bailing out of recently established losing positions.
</P>
<P>
   Reischauer, who is now with the Brookings Institution, said the
impact of current developments would depend not only on how far the
stock market fell but also on whether, for example, corporate
profits faltered badly or instability in Russia and elsewhere
prompted an increase in the military budget.
</P>
<P>
   John Makin, a budget specialist at the American Enterprise
Institute, estimated that the current wave of selling would bring
the Treasury no more than an extra $10 billion of tax for the year,
and that the market's condition would have to become more acute to
justify worry about revenue shortfalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would take a very large move that would raise other issues
than the budget to have a noticeable impact'' on the nation's newly
restored fiscal health, he said.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ More than 6,000 pilots began a strike against
Northwest Airlines early Saturday in a dispute that stems from a
history of mistrust between management and labor in the airline
industry and two contradictory fears of the future.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots worry that Northwest will use new, smaller jets and
alliances with other airlines to phase out their high-paying jobs,
while management does not want to get caught in the next,
inevitable industry downturn with the highest labor costs among its
peers.
</P>
<P>
   The strike grounded all of Northwest's 400 airplanes and those
of its commuter affiliates, stranding thousands of passengers
worldwide. But it is certain to hit hardest here and in other
Midwest cities west of Chicago, where travelers depend on Northwest
for 75 percent to 100 percent of their air service.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there were few immediate problems at some Midwestern
airports, in part because many passengers had anticipated the
strike. Moreover, Northwest canceled several hundred flights before
the strike deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots' walkout was surprising because in recent years both
management and workers in the airline industry have come to realize
how destructive strikes can be. The last major airline strike _
when machinists walked out at Eastern Airlines in 1989 _ ultimately
drove that airline out of business.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton declined to intervene in the pilots' strike,
urging both sides to iron out their differences. But administration
officials said that if the strike extended into the Labor Day
weekend and caused widespread inconvenience, the president would
reconsider his decision.
</P>
<P>
   The president had intervened to halt a strike by pilots at
American Airlines last year. But industry executives say that
Clinton took the rare action only after it was clear that both
sides were looking for a face-saving way to step back from the
abyss.
</P>
<P>
   Both Northwest, which is the country's fourth-largest airline in
terms of revenue, and the pilots have repeatedly expressed their
determination to reach a settlement. But after the strike deadline
of 12:01 a.m. Eastern time passed Saturday and the 17 members of
the Air Line Pilots Association's ruling Master Executive Council,
dressed in their pilots uniforms, marched grim-faced into a press
conference at a downtown hotel here, the wide gulf between the two
sides became clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``After two years of negotiations, Northwest management still
has not accepted their responsibility to make the tough negotiating
decisions and instead has chosen to focus their energy on shutting
down this airline,'' said Steve Zoller, the council chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Zoller said the union was prepared to negotiate around the clock
if necessary to reach a settlement _ a pledge that was quickly
echoed by Northwest management. But both sides said later that
there were no plans to resume talks Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Zoller also ordered members to stay in position around the world
until noon Saturday rather than return home, a move that would make
it easier to quickly restart the airline if an agreement were
reached. But Northwest said that it did not feel pressed to settle.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only a few air travelers seemed to have had their travel
plans disrupted because of the strike. At the Detroit Metropolitan
Airport on Saturday morning, for example, Northwest and airport
agents far outnumbered the handful of passengers.
</P>
<P>
   While Northwest normally handles 40,000 passengers a day whose
flights begin or end in Michigan, Robert Ball, Northwest's vice
president for customer service in Detroit, said that because of the
strike, the airline had sold fewer tickets and was faced with only
29,000 passengers a day to put on other carriers.
</P>
<P>
   One of those passengers was Kathi Harris, a 47-years-old nurse
from Plymouth, Mich. As a strike seemed inevitable on Friday night,
Mrs. Harris said that she had begun calling Northwest's toll-free
number but found it constantly busy. She called America West
Airlines just after midnight and was able to get seats Saturday
morning without difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   But other travelers had avoided booking on Northwest. ``When we
made these plans, we didn't want to take a chance,'' said Matthew
Doutre, a children's welfare worker, as he waited with his wife,
Karen, and three children, for a Southwest Airlines flight to
Florida.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Soon before its pilots went on strike, Northwest made a show of
releasing its last offer to the pilots. But the pilots said that
their side had made the last offer and that Northwest had stopped
negotiating Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball is in their court,'' said Paul Omodt, the spokesman
for the pilots union.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest's 6,200 pilots earn an average annual salary of
$120,000, according to the union, while the company puts the number
at $133,000. They are seeking large increases in pay and retirement
benefits and added job security to make up for the sacrifices they
made in 1993 when they took cuts of nearly 16 percent along with
other unionized workers to save the company from bankruptcy. In
exchange, the pilots received more than 14 million shares of
Northwest stock and a seat on its board of directors. But instead
of allying their interests with management, those moves seem to
have further alienated the pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest pilots have not had a raise since their wage cuts were
restored, and they have been trying to negotiate a new contract
since August 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In the same period, the company has expanded its international
alliance with Royal Dutch KLM Airlines of the Netherlands, has
announced a ``global strategic alliance'' with Continental Airlines
and has bought an increasing number of smaller jets for its
commuter affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots see each of these developments as threats to their
jobs. ``We did not save this airline in 1993 to have our jobs
outsourced in 1998,'' Omodt said.
</P>
<P>
   The company's last offer included a pay raise that it said would
raise pilot wages above those of their counterparts at American
Airlines, Delta Airlines and United Airlines, which are much larger
than Northwest. It also included profit sharing, a lump sum of $57
million divided among the pilots, a reduction in the two-tier pay
scale that keeps younger pilots working for an average 40 percent
less than more senior pilots for five years, and a guarantee of no
layoffs until one year after the five-year contract expires.
</P>
<P>
   But the pilots said that the offer was far too little, and they
accused Northwest management of using clever language to make it
sound more generous than it was.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Murphy, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New
York, said that the pilots demand for an ``industry-leading
contract'' was difficult for the airline to meet. ``Northwest is
not a big enough carrier to set precedents,'' he said. ``They are a
follower.''
</P>
<P>
   Northwest is further hobbled by the fact that once it is
finished negotiating with the pilots, it must also negotiate
contracts with unions representing its maintenance workers,
customer service representative and flight attendants. If the
pilots get a generous settlement, the other unions will demand
equal largess.
</P>
<P>
   But weathering a long strike may be equally devastating.
Northwest will lose $12 million a day at the beginning of a strike,
but the costs will mount quickly as cash flows out of the airline's
coffers to pay for ticket refunds.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest has $3 billion in cash to help it weather a strike.
But if it were forced to spend that much money, its survival might
be in doubt.

 COMMENTARY: THE PRIVACY RUSE  (jt) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sometimes I think the Kabuki dance of anger and
healing must be fake.
</P>
<P>
   When I hear James Carville say of the president, ``Right now ...
he's getting an earful about what he did from the Mrs.,'' it sounds
tinny. They play up the image of Hillary as a swooping Fury for our
benefit, to make us think Bill Clinton is finally getting his
comeuppance.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps, behind closed doors on the Vineyard, the Clintons
are laughing and playing Scrabble.
</P>
<P>
   They have been through this same fight so many times before,
with Clinton never ceasing his alley-cat ways, does it still have
the power to wound? And if Hillary and Chelsea were really hurting,
would they turn for solace to a self-promoter like Jesse Jackson, a
preacher who schedules his spiritual counsel between appearances on
CNN and CBS? If they were crushed, would they try to knit their
family back together in a celebrity playground?
</P>
<P>
   In a moment that cries out for genuine privacy, the Clintons
choose counterfeit privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton makes a public show of private reconciliation _ he is so
busy ``healing'' he could not even return to the White House to
survey the collapse of Russia and the Dow _ because his presidency
hinges on it.
</P>
<P>
   He must persuade Americans that what happened with a 21-year-old
intern in the Oval Office is a purely personal matter. He must
persuade Americans that they do not need to worry about punishing
him, because his wife and daughter will do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even presidents have private lives,'' he said in his
unapology.
</P>
<P>
   But his argument is bogus. The private life of this couple has
public consequences. They campaigned on a slogan of ``Two for the
Price of One'' and their marital bargain has played a critical role
in determining public policy and in shaping the arc of their public
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was this: She would endure infidelities if he gave her
power. She proceeded to pretend that the power she was given was
power she had earned. ``They are holding large lead weights over
each other's heads,'' said one Clinton friend.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, after she vouched for her husband on ``60 Minutes,'' he
owed her his presidency. Surely, Mrs. Clinton knew or suspected
that Gennifer Flowers was telling the truth, yet she led the
campaign to defame the lounge singer.
</P>
<P>
   So the new president rewarded the new first lady with
unprecedented precincts of power. She ruled over the legal kingdom,
key appointments and health care. When her political judgment on
health care proved disastrous, her husband did not step in. She was
on her page, he was on his page.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has never hesitated to make the personal public when it
suited his political ends _ playing Oprah to the masses. A scruple
about privacy did not inhibit him from discussing his underwear or
his troubled marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons' private relationship also determined their public
response to Kenneth Starr. The president delayed confessing last
January, probably hoping to keep all the salacious details about
Monica from his wife. And Mrs. Clinton, typically, attacked
opponents and resisted giving up any information or documents.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that he was denying to her full knowledge of his
misdeeds. And her advice was based on his selective disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   If the Clintons had told more rather than less, sooner rather
than later, Starr might be lecturing now along the surf at
Pepperdine.
</P>
<P>
   Even Clinton's ridiculous confession reflects the couple's
tangle.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton was helping with a speech that could sink or save
the Clinton presidency, but she had an emotional conflict of
interest. Could she offer impartial guidance on whether to include
an apology to Monica Lewinsky? Was her heart really in rescuing a
husband who had humiliated her before the galaxy?
</P>
<P>
   As Peggy Noonan wrote in Time about Mrs. Clinton's involvement
in the ``historic failure'': ``This would seem to suggest that Dr.
Freud was right: a person who has been hurt by another individual
will sometimes take unconscious revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Clinton can do nothing that would risk the ire of Mrs.
Clinton. If she walks or if she talks, he is finished. But she will
not, because she likes the look of the world from 1600 Pennsylvania
Ave.

CALIFORNIA ROSE BREEDER PRODUCES MEMORIAL FLOWER FOR DIANA

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Boasting luscious pink and cream blooms, the
hybrid tea rose stands tall amid a small forest of seedlings,
presenting a profusion of colors inside a greenhouse tucked into
the hills of California's Las Posas Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Thousand Oaks, Calif., rose breeder Keith Zary suspected
something special would be produced by crossbreeding
yellow-and-pink and fragrant pink seedlings some seven years ago.
And he knew the rose produced by the pair was the best among three
presented this spring to the trustees of the Diana, Princess of
Wales Memorial Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big, vigorous plant _ very tall, very stately. The
bloom is high-centered, with broad petals and opens fully. The
fragrance is sweet and spicy,'' Zary said, standing alongside a
block of the soon-to-be-coveted roses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very symbolic of her,'' he added. ``I thought she
was beautiful and courageous.''
</P>
<P>
   The English know their roses, and this group picked seedling No.
9111845 as the Diana, Princess of Wales rose to honor her memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only is it beautiful, but we are delighted that the sale
of this rose will help us continue to make a difference in the
causes held dear by the princess,'' said Vanessa Corringham of the
memorial fund last month when the rose debuted during a ceremonial
planting at the British Embassy in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Within days of Diana's death, the American Rose Society received
dozens of calls inquiring about varieties linked to the 36-year-old
princess, who touched so many with her humanitarian deeds around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can expect (that) whenever a celebrity dies, especially
one of her stature. It still generates calls,'' said Darlene
Kamperman, spokeswoman for the society, based in Shreveport, La.
</P>
<P>
   The rose Zary hybridized in the Somis, Calif., breeding gardens
operated by Jackson &AMP; Perkins in the heart of Ventura County
farming country is the first to bear an official registration,
according to the society, recognized as the international registrar
of roses since 1955. There are more than 20,000 varieties on
record.
</P>
<P>
   A rose named The Princess of Wales, not yet available in the
United States, was hybridized by R. Harkness &AMP; Co. Ltd. in England.
Sales of that rose, white with a golden center, benefit the British
Lung Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The Diana, Princess of Wales variety will debut in the October
catalog from Jackson &AMP; Perkins, founded in 1872 and now the largest
U.S. rose producer. The rose will be available in nurseries and
garden supply centers next year.
</P>
<P>
   Even without advertising, Jackson &AMP; Perkins already is filling
mail orders. The company, based in Medford, Ore., will donate 15
percent of the $24.95 retail price to the memorial fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a really astonishing volume. This has been obviously
very popular with our customers,'' said company spokesman Bill
Ihle.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial fund was established last fall to raise money for
some of Princess Diana's favorite charities and to control hundreds
of companies and individuals seeking to market her name and image.
</P>
<P>
   An official rose was not far behind.
</P>
<P>
   Given the task of selecting the best varieties to yield a
memorial rose was a welcome challenge for Zary.
</P>
<P>
   After earning a doctorate in horticulture, Zary spent five years
breeding string beans for Sun Seeds in Minnesota. In 1985,
legendary rose breeder Bill Warriner hired and began grooming Zary
to take over his post with Jackson &AMP; Perkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were looking for a qualified breeder who had no
experience with roses ... who had the technical skills but no
biases,'' Zary recalled. ``That's what attracted me to the job. You
could get rid of the straitjacket.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the company's vice president of research and one of its two
breeders, Zary leads the effort to winnow some 400,000 seedlings to
about 10 commercial hybrids each year.
</P>
<P>
   Every spring, Zary and his team select parent rose plants.
Pollen from the male is placed on the pistil of the female,
producing seeds that are planted to produce a hybridized seedling.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, tiny bud eyes are cut from vigorous seedlings
with attractive flowers and grafted onto a fast-growing rootstock.
Then, after 18 months, the seedling is ready to be multiplied _
possibly becoming a commercial variety in a decade's time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a remarkably cold process of roguing out the ones that
aren't good enough,'' Zary said.
</P>
<P>
   He also describes the work as ``a mixture of art and science.''
That talent has garnered Zary an American Rose Society Award of
Excellence and several awards from All American Rose Selections
Inc. This year, Zary's roses received a gold medal and Best of Show
at the top European competitions in England and The Hague _ rare
recognition for an American breeder.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Diana, Princess of Wales rose remains one of his few
favorites.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to offer a memorial flower, you should do your
best,'' he said. ``That was the critical thing in the selection
process, I wanted it to be the best.''

SPORTS COLUMN: PATERNO REMAINS THE LION KING  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM C. RHODEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joe Paterno was on the phone last week energetically fielding
questions about a new season. Who will be Penn State's outside
linebacker? How will he cope with the loss of his star running
back, Curtis Enis? Who will be the starting quarterback?
</P>
<P>
   In the course of a 33-year tenure, Paterno, who at 72 is the
oldest college football head coach in Division I-A, has heard it
all before: new names, same concerns. Who will replace Jack Ham?
Who will replace Franco Harris? Who will replace Kerry Collins?
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of team that keeps old coaches young and drives
young coaches crazy. Paterno loves it. The Nittany Lions are young
and talented with several positions up for grabs. Penn State was
rated an unrealistic No. 1 at this time last season. This year, the
Nittany Lions are ranked by the Associated Press at a more modest
No. 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm probably more comfortable with our situation this year,''
Paterno said. ``I like young teams. I like the challenge of
teaching.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This season holds special significance for Paterno. With two
more victories, he will become the sixth college football coach
with 300 victories, the fourth to achieve that milestone in
Division I. He would also become the first Division I coach with
300 victories at one school.
</P>
<P>
   The list of those with 300 victories is impressive: Eddie
Robinson (405-157-15), Bear Bryant (323-85-17), Pop Warner
(319-106-32), Amos Alonzo Stagg (314-199-35) and John Gagliardi
(336-100-11 and counting at the small-college St. John's, Minn.).
</P>
<P>
   Paterno is 298-77-3, and his teams have won two national
championships, in 1982 and '86. He has had undefeated teams in
1968, '69, '73, '86 and '94. He doesn't dwell on a 300th victory,
and has tried to steer clear of questions about what it means to
his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm dead, that'll be fine,'' he said. ``I'm just worried
about Southern Mississippi.''
</P>
<P>
   Franco Harris was a freshman at Penn State in 1968 when the
Nittany Lions went undefeated for the first time under Paterno.
Thirty years later, Paterno is not merely ``at it'' but going
strong.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, who is a partner in Parks Sausage, based in Baltimore
and Super Bakery based in Pittsburgh, went on to a 13-year,
Hall-of-Fame career in the National Football League. He has
followed his old coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to admit it has been a surprise,'' Harris said by
telephone. ``There were a few years in the past where I thought he
was tired of it. The more that I have been around him lately, the
more I can see why he's still in it. He still has the passion for
the game. He feels that he still has some challenges that he wants
to meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was wondering if he would be able to adjust to the different
generations of athletes. Some things he's maintained, but he has
realized that athletes are a little bit different now, that you
have to deal with some things differently now.''
</P>
<P>
   This season may be a case in point. Paterno has not decided
among Kevin Thompson, Rashard Casey or Chad Kroell for the
quarterback job. ``I'm a one-quarterback guy,'' he said. But he
added, ``Hopefully I'm not that set in my ways not to go with a
two-quarterback rotation if the circumstances dictate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris said Paterno could go for another decade, and Paterno
said he might.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have programmed myself that I want to go through 2001,''
Paterno said. ``If I feel as good as I feel right now and I feel I
can put up with the media, I might say two years from now that I
want to go four more years.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Harris said, there is no indication that Paterno has
lost a step.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, sometimes during our careers not every year's going to
be great,'' Harris said. ``But what shows the real spirit of
somebody is when they can bounce back and show people. `Hey, don't
take one year here, one year there, to mean that this guy's
defeated.'
</P>
<P>
   ``To me,'' Harris continued, ``it's not a question of age. When
you're around Joe you don't think about his age. As long as
somebody still has the drive and determination and the passion for
what they want to do, I don't think age gets to be a factor.''

<P>
   &UR; THUMBNAIL SKETCHES OF LEADING CANDIDATES FOR THE HEISMAN
TROPHY: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   1. Ricky Williams, running back, Texas: Returned for his senior
season to take a run at Tony Dorsett's 32 year-old career rushing
record. He was the fifth-place vote-getter last year, but Texas
needs to do much better than last year's 4-7.
</P>
<P>
   2. Cade McNown, quarterback, UCLA: Last year, he finished with a
168.6 quarterback rating, 12th-best all-time in college. Could
emerge as the favorite if Bruins coast through a soft schedule.
</P>
<P>
   3. Kevin Faulk, running back, LSU: Also returned for his senior
year after gaining 1,444 yards. He has several showcase games in
well-followed SEC _ Georgia and Florida _ as well as a date at
Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   4. Tim Couch, quarterback, Kentucky: This is probably the
junior's last season in college. He threw for 3,884 yards and 37
touchdowns. The Wildcats, however, have to be better than last
year's 5-6 record.
</P>
<P>
   5. Donovan McNabb, quarterback, Syracuse: He has started 37
straight games and his scrambling style and 55 career touchdowns
can electrify voters. The Orangeman need to upset Tennessee and
Michigan the first two weeks of the season to rocket him into
contention.

KEITH JACKSON CALLING IT A CAREER  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Keith Jackson is saying goodbye. This is his final season. He is
nearly 70 years old and figures the time is right to spend 12
months a year with his wife, Turi, and stop all that crazy travel
to watch those big kids act out their aggressions in Lincoln, Ann
Arbor, Columbus, Iowa City and Happy Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm obviously going to miss it,'' he said by telephone
recently. ``But I'm going to sit back, get up in the morning and
decide what to do. I don't want a farewell tour. It's disruptive.
It interrupts with our commitment, which is to provide the best
coverage we can.''
</P>
<P>
   He will start his 31st of college football at ABC Sports on
Monday night when Florida State plays Texas A&AMP;M. He will end it
with two post-season games: Jan. 1 at the Rose Bowl and Jan. 4 at
the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting to be an old goat,'' he said. ``It's a good time
for this to happen. It's not sudden. It's been carefully planned. I
try to be a smart aleck and say it's time for me to move out and
see if the new generation moving in is as smart as they're telling
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's voice remains a great instrument. Like Vin Scully, he
has recorded the soundtrack of his sport for decades. He may have
called baseball, ``Monday Night Football,'' boxing and basketball,
but Jackson will eternally be college football. Flip on ESPN
Classic Sports and the next game you hear is likely to be one
called by Jackson. Of course, the next one might be one called by
Brent Musburger, also of ABC, who is unlikely to be Jackson's
successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't made the decision,'' said Steve Anderson, the
executive producer of ABC Sports. ``It's an important decision and
one we don't plan on doing any time soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: Brad Nessler is the next best voice available at
ABC, but when Jackson retires, ABC will suffer a loss as great as
baseball's when Mel Allen was fired.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Jackson thinks his impact is terribly
overrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game is sacred,'' he said. ``I've had more fun than
anybody and if I've helped people enjoy the broadcasts, that's my
purpose. A guy blows $1,000 on a TV set, he doesn't turn it on to
hear what I have to say. It's the game.''
</P>
<P>
   To some degree that's correct. If you care about Michigan-Ohio
State, you will watch regardless of who's calling the game. But
Jackson has expanded the enjoyment quotient through preparation,
enthusiasm and a colorful, born-on-the-farm vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a staple phrase,'' he said, although he insisted
that the timeworn ``Whoa, Nellie!'' was never really his until it
``got hung on me.'' Now his partner Bob Griese ``goads me into
saying it.''
</P>
<P>
   But his penchant for descriptive phrasing ``goes back to what
Ted Husing said to me: `Never be afraid to turn a phrase. If you
can say something in such a way that's explanatory, has flavor and
people can understand it, try it. If it means quoting Shakespeare
or Goethe, do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Despite vast experience calling other sports, he has viewed
himself as a college football announcer. He grew up in rural
Georgia, ``goofy'' for college football, for teams like the
Chattanooga Moccasins and players like Georgia Tech's Clint
Castleberry, and the excitement of times when ``Georgia would play
the Ivies.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the pungent style, Jackson's integrity will be missed.
On and off the air, he is an eloquent about true higher education,
and he usually has plenty of tart opinions. ``Fighting Irish?'' he
asked. ``There's isn't a Notre Dame in all of Ireland. It was
founded by a Frenchman.''
</P>
<P>
   And he rarely misses an opportunity to say his job is to call
games played by young men with ``mamas and daddies'' in the stands,
not be a journalist.
</P>
<P>
   So he will be missed. Without him, who will feed us our
requisite diet of big uglies, bell cows and fummmmbles, the zest
that makes three-hour games worthwhile? And who will offer words
comparable to, ``No outstretched arms have reached to the heavens,
but they're teetering toward Hallelujah land.''

FORGET THE HAIR AND TATTOOS, JUST WATCH RICKY RUN  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Look at the refrigerator in his apartment in
Austin, Texas, and the photocopied wish stuck to the door: ``Don't
follow me. I may not lead,'' it reads. ``Don't lead me. I may not
follow. Just walk next to me and be my friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Then ask him why he cut short his minor league baseball season
this summer to return to the University of Texas campus to play
football.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because this is my team,'' Ricky Williams said. ``I'm it's
leader and I need to set the example for the guys to follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Notice the Bob Marley poster and listen to him tick off the
evolution of the late reggae star's music. Then watch him wade
through photographs of Doak Walker until he finds two he will paste
to his locker for the coming season, the whole time describing how
the Doaker came to embody all-American virtues and won the Heisman
Trophy in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Finally ask about his prospects for winning the Heisman, about
being the front-runner for college football's most celebrated
award. And at 21, the Longhorn tailback is formed enough to say
that he thought he should have won it last year. That he was
``heartbroken'' when he was not even invited to the Downtown
Athletic Club for the awards ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not concerned about it this year; I believe I put up
Heisman numbers last year,'' said Williams, whose 1,893 yards and
13.2-point scoring average led the nation. ``Anymore the award goes
to the best player on the best team. So I've got other goals.''
</P>
<P>
   They begin with helping Texas coach Mack Brown in what should be
a mutually beneficial relationship as the new coach tries to turn
around a program that criminally underachieved last year by going
4-7.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' second goal is to break the school's career rushing
record held by the Longhorns' only Heisman winner, Earl Campbell
('77), a record that is only 289 yards and perhaps a single game
away.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the big one. Williams is the first player to enter
a season within 2,000 yards of Tony Dorsett's Division I-A career
rushing record of 6,082 yards set in 1973-76.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need 1,928 and I want them,'' Williams said softly.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of his goals, though, everyone seems to want to talk
about his dreadlocks. About the stud in his tongue. About the four
tattoos, the most colorful being the Mighty Mouse on his arm.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, a Tennessee native with a country twang, makes Williams
take his earrings off when representing the school, but even the
coach believes the focus on his running back's appearance has gone
too far.
</P>
<P>
   Brown says there are more important ways in which Williams is
different. Like how he speaks Spanish. Like how his precious
off-field time is spent visiting elementary schools _ hours at a
time. Like how he passed on millions of dollars _ money he was
likely to receive as a projected top seven pick in the National
Football League draft _ and returned for his senior season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky sent a message not only in Texas, but across the
country, that a degree and a final year in college is important,''
Brown says. ``It's kind of sad, but that's considered against the
norm.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams may look more like an art student than a jock, but he
is among the most wholesome Heisman candidates since, well, Doak
Walker. The two met in January at a banquet where Williams was
receiving the award named after Walker, the 1940s legend at
Southern Methodist, as the nation's best running back.
</P>
<P>
   Beforehand, Williams had picked up a book about Walker, and his
jaw dropped a little lower with each turn of the page. By the time
he shook hands with the old running back, Williams was overwhelmed.
He was thrilled to meet the modern stars on hand like Dorsett and
Eric Dickerson, but it was Walker he stayed close to the entire
evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``He accomplished so much but managed to stay this regular,
gentle guy,'' Williams said. ``We talked all night, but when people
came up to say hello to him it didn't matter if they were Hall of
Famers or the waiter, he treated everyone the same.''
</P>
<P>
   When, a few weeks later, Walker was paralyzed from the neck down
in a skiing accident, Williams wrote him a letter. Then another.
And another. He shrugs off reports that his notes continue to bring
tears to the eyes of Walker and his wife, Skeeter.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' former coach, John Mackovic, knows about these small
kindnesses. The Longhorns' 1997 season was lost early when UCLA,
led by Williams' Heisman rival, quarterback Cade McNown, thumped
them at home, 66-3. By November, Williams sat on the sideline at
Baylor witnessing a fourth consecutive loss and decided then and
there that he was off to the NFL. Still, each Sunday, he would drop
by Mackovic's office after watching film to try to cheer him up.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing phony about him,'' said Mackovic. ``One of the
things I tried to reinforce is that there's more to winning the
Heisman than talent. You have to conduct yourself like a
Heisman-caliber person. Ricky has in every way. I hope more people
get to know him because he's disarming.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams mother, Sandy, says this generous spirit always existed
within her only boy. But it also bumped alongside an anger fueled
by the desertion of his father when he was 5. While growing up in
San Diego, he would cook dinner for his two sisters while his
mother worked as government purchasing agent at $5.50 an hour and
attended school at night.
</P>
<P>
   But he also tussled with his twin sister, Cassie, and his
younger sister, Nisey, and underwent anger counseling. When he was
tested as a 6-year-old, his mother said counselors found he had the
IQ of a 12-year-old. His dual shadings were already in place. He
would wear his football helmet to sleep. But he also insisted on
getting his ears pierced at age 10 and his first tattoo at 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is different,'' his mother said. ``He's always been in a
world of his own. Some say he has an old soul, that he acts like
he's been here before.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Now the gentlest of souls off the field, his rage is confined to
Saturday afternoons when he hurtles his 6-foot-1-inch, 220-pound
body in devastating fashion on the football field. He can run the
40-yard dash in 4.4-seconds, but Williams prefers to run like the
fullback he was his first two years at Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can run over you or around you,'' said Texas A&AMP;M's
All-American linebacker candidate, Dat Nguyen. His game is as
well-rounded as he is. He is an excellent blocker with soft hands
and runs precise pass routes. Williams says he owes his NFL
potential to Mackovic. His former coach says the running back is
that rare breed whose brain and heart match his talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to learn to block,'' Mackovic said. ``He can
assimilate so much information on the field. We never had to bring
him along. We'd show him something once and he'd do it. He's a
great all-round back.''
</P>
<P>
   When Williams announced he was returning for his senior year, it
set off a raucous celebration at a news conference packed with
Longhorn supporters. ``We have just had a successful recruiting
season,'' a jubilant Brown declared over the din.
</P>
<P>
   Williams appreciates their glee, as well as the way Brown never
pressured him to stay. ``But I didn't do it for them,'' he said.
``I did it for me.''
</P>
<P>
   He thought he was NFL bound, but while at home for Christmas in
San Diego he attended services at the North Park Apostolic Church.
There, Bishop Joel Trout delivered a sermon that straightened
Williams up in his pew.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was about the grass not always being greener on the other
side,'' he said. ``It made me think that I'm pretty happy where I
am, why would I need to get more when I really don't need it and
risk being unhappy?''
</P>
<P>
   For part of his past four summers, he has played left field in
Class A for the Philadelphia Phillies. He hit a career-high .288
for the Batavia Muckdogs this summer before returning to the weight
room here, but acknowledges his part-time participation is
thwarting his development.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it has indulged his passion for the game and made him
enough money _ about $100,000 _ to move his mother to Austin and
pay tuition for his sisters at Texas. He will attempt to play both
football and baseball professionally, but neither transcends his
true long-term goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an education major and I want to teach,'' Williams said.
``So the plan is work hard, succeed, invest wisely and then teach
elementary school.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams may be unconcerned about the Heisman, but his coach and
teammates are not. Brown says he believes he owes Williams a shot
at the trophy because the coach and the program are likely to
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will use that kind of national exposure in my recruiting,''
said Brown, who built North Carolina into a power by attracting
blue-chip prospects, including three picked in the top eight of
this year's NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I've got to help him,'' Brown said. ``You never see a
player win the Heisman Trophy on a team that doesn't perform at the
highest level. So I've challenged our football team. I told them
that if they wanted to see Ricky win the Heisman, we've got to win
a whole lot more games.''
</P>
<P>
   Only once in 63 years was the Heisman awarded to player on a
losing team _ in 1956 to Notre Dame's Paul Hornung. Longhorn
linebacker Dusty Renfro said the coaching staff has made the team
well aware of this. It has been driving them through summer
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can really see it in the offensive line,'' Renfro said.
``You hear them talking about getting Ricky over 2,000 yards. They
take pride. Every time he makes a big run, they have big smiles.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, everyone from Campbell to the former Texas coach
Darrell Royal has asked Williams to cut his hair and lose the studs
and rings _ to look more like Doak. He has respectfully declined,
saying they don't slow him down on the field.
</P>
<P>
   And if it bothers Heisman voters? The nation's best running back
shrugs and smiles. ``They should know better,'' he said, ``than to
judge a book by its cover.''

<P>
   &UR; Atlantic 10 &LR;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &UR; Big 12  &LR;
</P>

<P>
   &UR; Western Athletic  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CONTENDERS &LR;  Colorado State in the Mountain Division, Utah in

JOE DRAPE'S TOP 20

   This is the dawn of the computer age in college football. No
longer will the ranking be the sole domain of know-nothing
sportswriters and broadcasters or coaches too absorbed in their own
teams' fates to keep up with clashes across the country. In fact,
The New York Times Computer Ranking will be included in the bowl
championship series calculations. But it doesn't come online until
after the fourth week of the season. For now, Joe Drape is
responsible for these selections. Please, no cards and letters. In
a few weeks, you'll be able to e-mail the know-nothing machines.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1. Nebraska &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1997 RECORD 13-0 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FINAL TIMES RANKING:1 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A new coach, Frank Solich, and a new quarterback, Bobby
Newcombe, are not expected to lead Nebraska to its fourth national
championship in five years. But the low expectations and the annual
reloading of talent should work in the Huskers' favor. Solich will
not stray from Nebraska's potent option offense. Seven defensive
starters return to one of the quickest units in Nebraska history.
Newcombe combines lightning speed with a strong arm, like the
former stars Tommy Frazier and Turner Gill, the current
quarterbacks coach.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOTTOM LINE &LR;  The defense must, dominate early in the season _
especially on Sept. 26 against Washington _ and allow Newcombe and
his line to get better. By Nov. 14, the Cornhuskers should be
primed to throttle Kansas State, the team many pick to win the Big
12, for the 30th straight time.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2. Florida &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1997 RECORD 10-2 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FINAL TIMES RANKING:5 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The front seven return from last year's 12th-ranked defense, and
five of them are future National Football League players, led by
tackle Ed Chester and middle linebacker Johnny Rutledge. Terry
Jackson steps in for Fred Taylor at running back, while Doug
Johnson and Jesse Palmer will tag-team at quarterback. It doesn't
matter _ there is only one Steve Spurrier, and the offense he
designs will be locked and loaded. The Gators saw their streak of
four straight Southeastern Conference titles snapped last year by
Tennessee. They start a new one this year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOTTOM LINE &LR;  The Gators need to go to Tallahassee on Nov. 21
and beat Florida State, as they have three of the last four
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 3. Florida State &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1997 RECORD 11-1 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FINAL TIMES RANKING:2 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It is a tribute to Coach Bobby Bowden that a team with only five
starting seniors and a 26-year-old rookie quarterback claimed the
No. 2 ranking in both the news media and coaches' preseason polls.
Linebacker Lamont Green and tackle Jerry Johnson anchor a defense
that will smother its weak Atlantic Coast Conference opponents.
Peter Warrick leads a swift, sure-handed receiving corps. But can
quarterback Chris Weinke, who played minor league baseball for six
years, get the ball to them?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOTTOM LINE &LR;  Weinke and the young Seminoles cannot stumble in
their season opener against a tough Texas A&AMP;M team, and they must
handle Florida at home to close out a 12-0 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 4. Michigan &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1997 RECORD 12-0 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FINAL TIMES RANKING:3 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Last season's co-national champion returns 9 of 11 starters from
the country's top-ranked defense. OK, one of the missing is the
Heisman Trophy winner, Charles Woodson. Still, the all-Big Ten
linebacker Sam Sword and safety Marcus Ray will head a unit that
will keep opponents demoralized. Four returning offensive linemen
and the sophomore running back Anthony Thomas will provide a
punishing ground game. But it is unclear whether the fourth-year
junior quarterback, Tom Brady, can replace Brian Griese's precise
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOTTOM LINE &LR;  The Wolverines need to do what they did last year:
run the table in the treacherous Big Ten. But they probably will
not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 5. Ohio State &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1997 RECORD 10-3 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FINAL TIMES RANKING:16 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Michigan Coach Lloyd Carr cast his preseason No. 1 vote for the
Buckeyes, who were the pick for the top spot in both polls.
Quarterback Joe Germaine might double the 1,847 yards and 16
touchdowns he threw for while splitting time with Stanley Jackson
last year. The all-American linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer is the
sledgehammer of a defense that ranked No. 8 last year. But junior
tailback Michael Wiley needs to prove a big-timer so they can
control the ball.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOTTOM LINE &LR;  Like the Wolverines, the Buckeyes need to sweep in
the Big Ten; they play Penn State and Michigan at home. But tough
nonconference games against West Virginia and Missouri might soften
them for Michigan, against whom they are 1-8-1 over the last 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 6. Arizona State &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1997 RECORD 9-3 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FINAL TIMES RANKING:15 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Remember the names Ryan Kealy and J.R. Redmond. They are the
cornerstones of one of the most explosive offenses in the nation.
Kealy, a sophomore, threw for 2,137 yards and 15 touchdowns as a
freshman, and Redmond, a junior, is a legitimate Heisman candidate
who averaged 6.1 yards a carry last year and might play in the Sun
Devils' secondary.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOTTOM LINE &LR;  The Sun Devils must beat Notre Dame on Oct. 10,
and Arizona on the road to end the season. They do not play their
Pacific-10 rival UCLA this season.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 7. UCLA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1997 RECORD 10-2 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FINAL TIMES RANKING:6 &LR;  &QL; 
Remember Gary Beban? He was the last Bruin to win the Heisman, 31
years ago. The senior quarterback Cade McNown is resurrecting
Beban's memory and is a front-runner in this year's race. Keith
Brown and Jermaine Lewis will not provide the running game that
Skip Hicks did last year, and the defense is young, with only one
returning starter. But the Bruins will be exciting behind McNown,
who threw for 22 touchdowns with only 5 interceptions last season.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOTTOM LINE &LR;  The Bruins must roll through a soft schedule _
they averaged 42 points in last year's 10 victories _ and McNown
must engineer a miracle in a bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 8. Kansas State &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1997 RECORD 11-1 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FINAL TIMES RANKING:4 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats' season begins and ends in the final two weeks.
They have a smothering defense and, behind the double-threat
quarterback Michael Bishop (nine running touchdowns, 13 passing
touchdowns in 1997), they should be 9-0 when Nebraska comes to
Manhattan, Kan., on Nov. 14. Can they beat the Cornhuskers? They
have not done it in 29 years. Win or lose, they face a dangerous
Missouri team the next week on the road.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOTTOM LINE &LR;  Something extraordinary must happen, like Nebraska
self-destructing. More likely is another impressive one-loss
season.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 9. Tennessee &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1997 RECORD 11-2 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FINAL TIMES RANKING:7 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Vols will benefit from low expectations, post-Peyton
Manning. The junior quarterback Tee Martin has thrown only 16
passes in two seasons, but in each of those years he has been
recognized as the best athlete on the team. In high school, he
threw for more than 4,000 yards, ran for 1,000, scored 49
touchdowns and averaged 42.3 yards as a punter. He will have plenty
of help from Jamal Lewis, who gained 1,364 yards rushing as a
freshman last season and is a year away from being a Heisman
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOTTOM LINE  &LR; The Vols must beat Florida on Sept. 19, ending
their five-game losing streak to the Gators, which would get them
into the Southeastern Conference championship game.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 10. West Virginia &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1997 RECORD 7-5 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FINAL TIMES RANKING:60 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   An opening-week upset at home against Ohio State would put West
Virginia on the way to an 11-0 finish, thanks to weak Big East
opposition and nonconference games against Tulsa and Navy. The
junior tailback Amos Zereoue needs just 25 yards to become West
Virginia's career rushing leader, and he should better his
10th-place finish in last year's Heisman voting. Quarterback Marc
Bulger, who passed for 2,112 yards last season, is also back. Coach
Don Nehlen is still tinkering with a defense that, through injury
and ineptness, contributed mightily to five defeats in the last six
games.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOTTOM LINE &LR;  The Mountaineers must shock Ohio State. Then it
could be clear sailing, though their schedule will not get them
into the national title game.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &UR; 11. Louisiana State &LR;

   &UR; 1997 RECORD 9-3 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FINAL TIMES RANKING: 14 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Many expected the Tigers to contend for the national title this
season, but the program has been roiled by off-field incidents that
have forced Coach Gerry DiNardo, a disciplinarian, to kick major
contributors off the team _ most notably Cecil (the Diesel)
Collins. LSU still has a grind-you-down offense led by tailback
Kevin Faulk, a Heisman candidate, and the experienced quarterback
Herb Tyler. But the Tigers have not proved that they can win the
games they should; last year they lost to Ole Miss and Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOTTOM LINE &LR;  The Tigers must beat DiNardo's alma mater, Notre
Dame, and win the SEC West division to get to the conference title
game.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 12. Colorado State &LR;

<P>
   &UR; 1997 RECORD 11-2 &LR;

   &UR; FINAL TIMES RANKING &LR; : 8
</P>
<P>
   All Coach Sonny Lubick does is win. He is 41-19 since coming to
this perennial Western Athletic Conference loser six years ago.
Nine defensive starters return to a team that upset Missouri in the
Holiday Bowl. Damon Washington and Kevin McDougal are the best
running back tandem in the nation; each rushed for more than 1,100
yards last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOTTOM LINE &LR;  The Rams must avenge last year's loss to in-state
rival Colorado in their season opener, march through the WAC and
end up in the Bowl Championship Series mix.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 13. Virginia &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1997 RECORD 7-4 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FINAL TIMES RANKING: 21 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Coach George Welsh managed 7 victories last season despite 4 new
coaches and 16 new starters. Now seasoned, Virginia, behind a
defense led by the all-America safety Anthony Poindexter, will
manhandle its weak Atlantic Coast Conference opponents. Its
offense, directed by the ACC's top-rated passer, the 6-foot-4-inch
200-pound Aaron Brooks, will be a deliberate machine embellished by
Brooks' scrambling flourishes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOTTOM LINE &LR;  The Cavaliers must beat Florida State in
Tallahassee on Nov. 7 and prove the ACC is no one-horse conference.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 14. Syracuse &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1997 RECORD: 9-4 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FINAL TIMES RANKING: 24 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Can Syracuse survive its first two games, against Tennessee and
Michigan? Can Donovan McNabb show he is a legitimate Heisman
hopeful? Yes and yes, but the Orangeman need to leave their streaky
ways at the door; they lost three of their first four games last
year then rallied to win their final eight. McNabb has plenty of
help in the 6-3, 255-pound Rob Konrad, who is the best fullback in
the nation. The speedy Quinton Spotwood caught eight touchdown
passes, and returned four kicks for touchdowns to tie a National
Collegiate Athletic Association record.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOTTOM LINE  &LR; The Orangemen must at least split their first two
games, stay focused for an entire season and land in the Bowl
Championship Series mix.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 15. Texas A&AMP;M &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1997 RECORD 9-4 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FINAL TIMES RANKING: 28 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Dante Hall, Sirr Parker and D'Andre Hardeman combined for more
than 2,200 rushing yards and 26 touchdowns last year, and helped
the Aggies establish a school record for most points in a season.
The all-America linebacker Dat Nguyen leads a stingy defense, but
there is a lack of depth on both sides of the ball and a suicidal
schedule. The Aggies start with Florida State Monday night, and
face Louisiana Tech, Southern Miss, Nebraska and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOTTOM LINE &LR;  The Aggies must put up a 9-3 record against one of
the toughest schedules in the nation and have enough players
healthy for the Big 12 championship game.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 16. Georgia &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1997 RECORD 10-2 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FINAL TIMES RANKING: 9 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Georgia lost three stars in quarterback Mike Bobo, tailback
Robert Edwards and the multipurpose skills player Hines Ward. But
Coach Jim Donnan has his team back in the SEC elite. The
quarterback position is unsettled, but look for the former minor
league baseball player Quincy Carter to emerge. The backfield of
Patrick Pass and Olandis Geary could emerge as the best in the SEC,
running behind two future No. 1 draft picks, tackles Matt
Stinchcomb and Chris Terry.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOTTOM LINE &LR;  The Bulldogs must beat LSU in Baton Rouge and best
their hated rival, Florida, for the second year in a row.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 17. Penn State &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1997 RECORD 9-3 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FINAL TIMES RANKING: 25 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Joe Paterno needs 2 victories to reach 300 for his career. His
defense will power this edition of the Nittany Lions: the senior
Brad Scioli, returning from tight end, will be part of a pair of
dominating defensive ends with Courtney Brown. Brandon Short will
draw more notice to the Big Ten for its linebackers. On offense,
Paterno will call on all his knowledge to retool a unit that lost
running back Curtis Enis and receiver Joe Jurevicius.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOTTOM LINE &LR;  Paterno must make his milestone season with the
Nittany Lions miraculous and handle Ohio State and Michigan on the
road.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 18. Southern Mississippi &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1997 RECORD 9-3 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FINAL TIMES RANKING: 92 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A season opener at Penn State and a matchup with Texas A&AMP;M two
weeks later will introduce quarterback Lee Roberts to the nation.
He needs just 15 touchdown passes to break Brett Favre's school
record. He has the most prolific pass-catching duo in school
history, Sherrod Gideon and Todd Pinkston, to help him. The
defense, as always, will be superb.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOTTOM LINE &LR;  The Golden Eagles must upset either Penn State or
Texas A&AMP;M on their way to winning a third consecutive Conference
USA title.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 19. Missouri &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1997 RECORD 7-5 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FINAL TIMES RANKING: 36 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Corby Jones, who may be the best quarterback in the Big 12, is 1
of 15 returning starters from a team that nearly cost Nebraska its
national title. Jones, who passed for 12 touchdowns and ran for 14
more, can fairly be compared to Tommy Frazier: like the former
Cornhuskers star, Jones is a galvanizing leader. He lost his
father, and the Tigers lost a beloved assistant coach, when Curtis
Jones died of a heart attack in July. It will be an emotional year
for the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOTTOM LINE &LR;  The Tigers must upset either Ohio State on Sept.
19, Nebraska on Oct. 24 or Kansas State on Nov. 21 and return to a
bowl game for the second straight year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 20. Notre Dame &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1997 RECORD 7-6 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FINAL TIMES RANKING:26 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Their off-the-field problems have been well documented; now the
Irish face a brutal schedule that features six teams that beat them
last year. The new quarterback, Jarious Jackson, will make the
faithful forget Ron Powlus and remember Tony Rice. Autry Denson, an
underrated running back, gained 1,337 yards last year behind a
young line; now that line has three starters returning, and Coach
Bob Davie will rely more on the option.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOTTOM LINE &LR;  The Fighting Irish must beat Michigan, Arizona
State or LSU and manage to stay ranked throughout the year.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   They want you to believe that this is the year college football
rushes into the future, when quartiles and adjusted deviations get
swirled with the quaint, old-fashioned polls to crown an undisputed
national champion.
</P>
<P>
   They want you to believe that the coaching conga line _ 13 new
faces are popping up in Division I-A jobs _ will give the 1998
season a saucier, more unpredictable beat.
</P>
<P>
   And they want you to believe that this is really the year of the
quarterback, even though Peyton Manning and Ryan Leaf have moved on
to NFL Sundays. Cade McNown at UCLA on the left coast. Daunte
Culpepper at Central Florida anchoring the East. Kentucky's Tim
Couch, Kansas State's Michael Bishop, Missouri's Corby Jones and
Syracuse's Donovan McNabb in between, insuring that Saturday
afternoon bombs will go off across America.
</P>
<P>
   Who are they? Conference commissioners, coaches, writers,
television pundits and, most important, the game's multitude of
fans.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of college football endures because there is no
league office, no catchy marketing slogan, no free agency or
playoff structure to encroach on the mystery of who is the best
team in the land. Beginning in earnest next weekend, America will
once more become a virtual bar room where this cacophony of voices
will spend the autumn arguing over who deserves to be No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all a mystery; that's why you line them up and play
them,'' said Penn State's Joe Paterno, who is two victories away
from becoming only the sixth college coach to earn 300. He has
earned the right to make an old coach's cliche sound like gospel.
</P>
<P>
   Paterno isn't the only thing that will look familiar about the
1998 college football season. The usual suspects have been rounded
up to contend for the national title: Nebraska, Florida State,
Florida, Michigan and Ohio State. But the Bowl Championship Series
has been concocted to pick two of them for a true No. 1-against-No.
2 bowl game, this season on Jan. 4 at the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   To do so, the conference commissioners have come up with a
four-part mathematical formula that is entertaining, confusing and
ultimately as fallible as the news media and coaches' polls. The
reporters and sideline generals remain a component, but they are no
longer the final arbiters of the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   On the coaching front, Mack Brown moves from North Carolina to
Texas. Paul Hackett goes from his perch as a National Football
League offensive coordinator high above Kansas City's Arrowhead
Stadium to the sidelines of USC. Houston Nutt returns from Boise
State to his alma mater, Arkansas, where he was a quarterback in
the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   But only one new coach matters: Frank Solich at Nebraska, which
has won all or part of three of the last four national
championships. He is a 53-year-old rookie head coach who spent 19
years as a Cornhusker assistant and projects an even more stolid
aura than his predecessor and mentor, the implacable Tom Osborne.
</P>
<P>
   And while the nation does boast a brigade of electrifying
quarterbacks, none is more intriguing than the starter down at
Florida State. Chris Weinke is a 26-year-old who failed as a
baseball minor leaguer and who will start his first football game
in nine years Monday against Texas A&AMP;M in the Kickoff Classic at
Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, toss in a wide-open Heisman Trophy race that is notable
for its unheralded (or at least not over-hyped) field, which is
headed by Texas running back Ricky Williams. He sports dreadlocks,
but fashions himself after such old-timers as Southern Methodist's
Doak Walker and another Longhorn, Earl Campbell _ the 1948 and 1977
Heisman winners.
</P>
<P>
   So how to make sense of this new season? By finding the
time-tested themes that run through it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Computing Who's No. 1 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Bowl Championship Series grew from the bowl alliance and was
made possible when the Big Ten and Pacific 10 conferences, along
with the Rose Bowl, agreed to take part. In theory, never again
will an undefeated Michigan team and an undefeated Nebraska team
each win a national championship, as was the case last year _ the
Wolverines finishing No. 1 in The Associated Press Poll, and the
Cornhuskers finishing on top of the USA Today/ESPN Coaches Poll.
</P>
<P>
   The series' goal is simple: to match the No. 1- and No. 2-ranked
teams in a title game which will rotate between the Sugar, Orange,
Fiesta and Rose bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Its methodology is not. It will factor in the coaches and news
media polls, three sets of computer rankings, teams' records and
the strength of their schedules. ``We believe we've come up with a
way to evaluate teams with equal records at the end of the season
other than just a subjective poll and determine the two teams that
would play in that championship game,'' said Roy Kramer,
commissioner of the Southeastern Conference and chairman of the
championship series.
</P>
<P>
   The best gauge of its potential success are the varying levels
of understanding that those most affected _ the coaches _ have of
the system. John Cooper, coach of both polls' preseason No. 1
choice, Ohio State, opts for blind faith: ``Any system where No. 1
and No. 2 meet on the field in the last game, I'm all for.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Bowden, whose Florida State team is the preseason polls'
second pick, embodies a prevalent confusion. First he said the
system leaves no margin for error, but then, remembering the 1993
title the Seminoles won despite a regular-season loss to Notre
Dame, he decides that ``maybe you get room for one error.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he gives up. ``I guess the thing is you only have to be
No. 2 after the season,'' he said. ``Shoot, I guess this is the
best we're going to get.''
</P>
<P>
   And Paterno worries about the possibility of abuses among his
colleagues in the formula's most accessible component: the coaches'
votes. Last year, Paterno caused a national uproar when he admitted
that an aide mistakenly voted for Florida State in first place on
his ballot when Paterno wanted Michigan on top.
</P>
<P>
   The voters in both polls _ 70 writers and broadcasters in one
poll and 62 head coaches in the other _ have come under fire for
offenses ranging from bias to lack of information. Now the two will
be averaged and will count in a broader and more definitive way.
``The potential danger is that some who will vote will be
self-serving, knowing that they need to land near the top to make
the title game,'' Paterno said. ``You hope we're professional
people who do what is honest.''
</P>
<P>
   If the computers compute correctly and the voters vote with
care, there remains only one way to guarantee an unimpeachable
national title game: two teams, and only two, need to go unbeaten
and untied, as has happened in five of the last seven seasons. If
three teams end with perfect regular-season records, which has
happened three times since 1979, the debate is re-opened. If one
team is perfect while two others have one loss, the discussion
turns to who is the true No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility also remains for a split championship in the
polls. The American Football Coaches Association will award its
final No. 1 ranking to whoever wins the title game. What if that's
a lackluster 7-6 game? The Associated Press poll could award its
title to a third team, perhaps one that was unbeaten and rolled
over a worthy opponent in another bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this a perfect system?'' asked Kramer, the championship
series chairman. ``There is no perfect system.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; For the Cornhuskers, a Coach on the Spot &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In Nebraska, saying that there is no perfect system would be
considered blasphemous. Frank Solich knows that. Like the
Nebraskans who slap his back a little harder now on the streets of
Lincoln, Solich believes the Cornhusker program is as flawless as
any involving pads and helmets. He played fullback under one
Nebraska coaching legend, and learned the intricacies of the system
as an assistant alongside another.
</P>
<P>
   In 11 seasons, Bob Devaney won 101 games and two national
titles. Over 25 years, Tom Osborne won 255 games, 13 conference
titles and three national titles. So what's expected from Solich
now that he has inherited the defending co-national champions, even
though it is a team that has lost a starting quarterback and I-back
and returns only one offensive lineman?
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people may have 8-3 expectations, but I haven't run into
any of them,'' Solich said in his characteristic monotone. ``When
people stop me on the street, they don't ask me how we'll do, they
tell me.''
</P>
<P>
   Solich was given a year to prepare for the job, which says as
much about the Cornhuskers' commitment to routine as it does about
the two laconic personalities involved. In July 1997, Solich said,
Osborne knocked on his door and asked for a minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach is not one for a lot of flair,'' Solich recalled. ``He
told me he was going to retire and I'd be the next coach. We talked
about when he would announce it. He asked me not to mention it to
anyone. The whole thing took 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mentioned it to my wife and crossed my fingers there. It was
an exciting moment for me, but I didn't have anyone to celebrate it
with.''
</P>
<P>
   At least until his team stumbles on the field, the Nebraska
faithful are confident that the Ferrari that is the Cornhusker
program has one more capable driver. And though Solich is a
Pennsylvania native, he has proved that he is sufficiently one of
them to take care of a team that has gone 60-3 over the last five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Once as a player, Solich strapped a 5-pound weight under his
T-shirt at a weigh-in so that Devaney wouldn't have second thoughts
about his 5-foot-8-inch, 150-pound recruit. The next year he was
named all-Big 8 at a whopping 165 pounds. He's also the guy who
honeymooned in Sioux City, Iowa, because he only had two days
before practice started at his first high school coaching job.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Rodgers, the 1972 Heisman winner, called Solich another
``link'' in a chain of excellence. Joel Makovicka, who started as a
walk-on fullback and now is a senior all-America candidate,
predicts Nebraska is putting its third consecutive coaching legend
on the field. ``He's just like coach Osborne,'' Makovicka said.
``He's a perfectionist, real intense, but is there for his players.
He isn't in your face, but you can see what he wants in his eyes.
He knows what we do at Nebraska and that's win.''
</P>
<P>
   Solich's selection caught the approving eyes of Paterno and
Bowden. Both are friends of Osborne. Neither expects a falloff.
``It is the right way to provide continuity in your program,''
Paterno said. ``No coach or individual is more important than the
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Solich has already demonstrated that he is a slave to that
edict. Like Osborne, he will call the plays. Like Osborne, he
believes in continuity and experience within the staff. ``I'm a
middle-of-the-road guy at 19 years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He will employ the 4-3 defense. He will plug in Bobby Newcombe,
the latest off the Turner Gill-Tommy Frazier-Scott Frost assembly
line, at quarterback in the option offense. The sophomore played
wing back last year and made big play after big play. .
</P>
<P>
   ``Nebraska doesn't change,'' Solich said. ``We have not tried to
be trendy. When passing teams were winning national championships
we didn't dump our offense. We know our offense. We know what we
need to get done.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; From the Diamond to the Gridiron &LR;
</P>
<P>
   He is a 6-5, 225-pound sophomore who speaks in the measured
tones of an investment banker. He hit .248 over six minor league
seasons as a first and third baseman, but when the Toronto Blue
Jays asked him to move to catcher, he had another position in mind.
</P>
<P>
   So Chris Weinke called Bobby Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1990, the Florida State coach had thought enough of
Weinke, a high school all-American, to sign him as the team's only
quarterback prospect. Then the Blue Jays called and offered
$400,000. Bowden did what he always does when baseball steals a
player: he told the kid he would hold his scholarship in case he
changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know when I said that, I was thinking that if he changed
his mind within two years, we'd have a scholarship for him,''
Bowden said, laughing. ``Not six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd already forgotten about him when he finally called again.
And thinking about it, if he had been a flighty guy, I probably
wouldn't have given him the scholarship.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Seminoles' national title hopes rest with a guy who has
more in common with the coaching staff than he does with his
teammates. When Weinke returned to school last season, he admits,
he was far more comfortable in coaches meetings than in the locker
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came in here, some guys were reluctant to talk to me
initially because of my age,'' he said. ``Some of the younger guys
didn't even know who I was. It took awhile for me to get used to
them and them to get used to me. There may be a situation where
they look up to me because I'm older, and I accept that role.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard not to smile when Bowden describes his 26-year-old
quarterback as a ``a true sophomore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a red-shirt junior, like most of our quarterbacks who
start are, so he's going to have to start a year sooner than we
anticipated,'' Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   The coach, however, recognizes that Weinke's maturity will be
vital to a young team that returns only 10 seniors, only 5 of them
to the starting lineup. Weinke only mopped up in a few games last
year, but he impressed Bowden with long hours in the film room.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a professional,'' Bowden said. ``He's got six years of
pro ball behind him. It's not football. But I don't know if anybody
has as much pressure as a guy does standing in that box trying to
hit the fastball with the bases loaded. I think it'll help him when
he's standing back in the pocket on third-and-5.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked the difference between Weinke and the other
Seminoles, running back Travis Minor burst out in a huge smile and
said, ``The rest of us are broke.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinke, a Minnesota native, said he invested his bonus wisely in
stocks and real estate. Asked if he is a millionaire, as rumored in
the locker room, Weinke smiled and said teasingly, ``I might be
close.''
</P>
<P>
   His biggest investment, however, may have been in breaking
through the generation gap with his young teammates. He stayed in
Tallahassee over the summer and organized throwing and running
drills, and he recently took his entire receiving corps out to
dinner at a seafood restaurant. The offensive line, which averages
314 pounds, will be his next guests.
</P>
<P>
   Where will he take them?
</P>
<P>
   ``To an all-you-can-eat buffet,'' he said, demonstrating the old
guy's wisdom he will be bringing to his new game. &QL;

CHILDREN'S GARDEN IN PARIS TO COMMEMORATE DIANA
</HEADLINE>
   (bl) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The city of Paris decided last week to bow to public
sentiment and create a monument to honor Diana, Princess of Wales,
who died here last Aug. 31 when her limousine, pursued by celebrity
photographers, crashed into a tunnel support pillar under the Place
de l'Alma.
</P>
<P>
   The monument will be a nature garden for children in her memory
that will open next spring in the Marais district, in the
historical heart of Paris at 21 rue des Blancs-Manteaux.
</P>
<P>
   But by the tens of thousands, ordinary people from Paris and all
over the world have long since created their own memorial to the
princess, on the Place de l'Alma above the spot where the accident
occurred: at a gold-leafed life-size replica of the flame of the
Statue of Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   The monument, overlooking the Seine, stands above the west
portal of the tunnel where the princess' escort, Emad Mohamed
(Dodi) Fayed, and their French driver, Henri Paul, died instantly
in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   A plaque says the torch was given to the French people in 1987
on the centenary of the Paris-based International Herald Tribune
newspaper as a symbol of French-American friendship.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of bouquets, cards, and messages in French, English,
Spanish, Arabic, Russian and other languages show that the
fascination for Diana still burns in the hearts of people all over
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Guneter Maatmann, 19, was one of a group of a dozen teen-agers
from Germany who made their pilgrimage to the site one morning last
week, leaving messages scrawled on an index card at the pedestal of
the flame.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the things we wanted to visit while we were in
Paris, not the only thing,'' he said, slightly embarrassed when
asked what he had written. ``Nothing important,'' he said. ``She
was a remarkable woman.''
</P>
<P>
   So many people visit the site that police have put up barricades
to keep them from risking injury by trying to go down into the
tunnel beneath the square to see the reinforced concrete pillar
that the princess' Mercedes slammed into at high speed shortly
after midnight on that Sunday a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   With a bodyguard, Trevor Rees-Jones, the only person in the car
who was wearing a seat belt and the only survivor of the crash, the
couple was trying to outrun photographers who had staked them out
at the Ritz Hotel. The hotel, owned by the father of Diana's
companion, Mohamed Fayed, the London-based Egyptian businessman,
employed the driver and the bodyguard and rented the Mercedes from
an agency.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Who bears legal or criminal responsibility for the accident, on
a roadway where the speed limit is only 30 miles an hour, is
something that two French investigating judges, Herve Stephan and
Marie-Christine Devidal, have been examining.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the few public statements that prosecutors have made
since the accident, they said last September that the driver, Paul,
had a blood-alcohol level more than three times the French legal
limit, as well as traces of antidepressants and drugs used to
control alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
   The driver's condition and excessive speed appear to be the
principal causes of the crash. But the week before last,
prosecutors also said they were trying to determine why, since Paul
died instantly in the crash, his body contained a slightly higher
than average trace of carbon monoxide, a product of automobile
exhaust that can cause drowsiness or unconsciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Stephan questioned Ritz Hotel president Frank Klein and
another hotel official. Prosecutors have been trying to determine
who ordered Paul, whose job was security director of the hotel, to
take the wheel of the Mercedes instead of a trained chauffeur, and
what the hotel management knew about his drinking that night.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors also said they were continuing to explore
evidence found at the scene that the Mercedes had sideswiped or
lightly brushed a smaller car, a white Fiat Uno, just as it hurtled
down the slightly curving roadway into the tunnel. But so far,
despite questioning 3,000 Fiat owners, the police have come up
empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the accident, the judges placed nine photographers
and one of their motorcycle drivers under investigation for
manslaughter and causing bodily injury as well as failure to come
to the aid of the victims. All 10 were at the scene just after the
crash and have acknowledged taking pictures of the wreckage. But
they have denied any interference with rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Death of a Princess,'' a book by two Paris-based American
journalists, Thomas Sancton and Scott MacLeod, published in the
United States by St. Martin's Press, reported that it took 1 hour
and 40 minutes to get Diana to a hospital because French doctors
tried to stabilize her condition at the scene and in the city
ambulance rather than rushing her to the emergency room and
treating her there first. She died at Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said the week before last that the investigating
magistrates were scrutinizing ``treatment provided at the scene,
during her transport by ambulance, and ultimately at the hospital''
and doing a detailed examination of the wreckage. The Mercedes had
previously undergone extensive repairs after being stolen, and
accounts in the French press have raised questions about whether
its brakes were in proper order.
</P>
<P>
   The investigations ordered by the judges would be completed by
the end of October, the prosecutors said, but justice officials
said the judges might not render their verdict until next year.
Only then would it become clear if anyone will face criminal
charges.

 By SELWYN RAAB    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the '90s began, Michael Blutrich and Lyle Pfeffer,
two men from sedate, middle-class backgrounds, were riding high.
Blutrich, a founding partner in a politically connected Park Avenue
law firm, and Pfeffer, a self-styled venture capitalist, were each
taking in more than $500,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   But they wanted more. Greed, they now admit, inspired them to
become prominent players in two major conspiracies: siphoning
millions from a Florida-based insurance company and allowing the
Gambino organized-crime family to become their secret partners in
Scores, the topless club on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Although the money rolled in at Scores, they say that for six
years they were consumed by fear about their Mafia ties.
Nevertheless, they accepted deals with mobsters who opened
discussions by slamming guns on the table, who threatened to blow
up Scores if the payoffs stopped and who mockingly promised to
eliminate any ``rats'' who exposed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew what I was doing were crimes,'' Blutrich said in a
recent interview in Manhattan about his alliance with the Gambinos,
one of the country's most powerful Mafia groups. ``I thought I was
giving up a finger. I didn't realize I was giving up an arm.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he had defrauded the insurance company and had been in
partnership with the mob, Pfeffer said, ``I was stupid and greedy
and we were on the fast track to success.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, both men switched sides, but only after federal and
state authorities implicated them in the insurance fraud and the
Scores case. Seeking reduced prison sentences, they worked
undercover for a year, taping more than 100 conversations that
prosecutors say contributed to indictments in January of several
members of the Gambino family on charges of extorting more than $1
million from Scores.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants include John A. Gotti, 34 _ the son of John J.
Gotti, 58, the family's imprisoned boss _ and other reputed
soldiers and associates.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Gotti, known as Junior, was helping run the crime
family at the time of the indictments, federal and state
prosecutors say.
</P>
<P>
   Because of what prosecutors say are Blutrich's and Pfeffer's
extensive personal contacts with Gambino family members, the two
men are expected to be pivotal witnesses against the younger Gotti
and five co-defendants at a trial scheduled for early next year in
U.S. District Court in White Plains.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first significant organized-crime case in which
two people who were not `made' members _ soldiers _ or associates
of a crime family obtained such a volume of graphic evidence
working undercover,'' said Myles Malman, a former federal
prosecutor in Florida who is Pfeffer's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for the reputed mobsters assert that the men's
white-collar crimes will destroy their value as witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government made sweetheart contracts with these two
reprobates,'' said Bruce Cutler, who is representing the younger
Gotti, and who is known for his combative cross-examinations.
``Their lifestyles and misdeeds will come back to haunt them when
they testify.''
</P>
<P>
   Another defense lawyer, Jay Goldberg, dismissed Blutrich's and
Pfeffer's testimony as worthless. ``These are typical swindlers,''
he said. ``The sky is the limit in terms of what they will say to
avoid prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Blutrich and Pfeffer, who are in the federal witness protection
program, gave a joint interview in which they told of their crimes
and their undercover mission against the Gambino family. They asked
Malman to arrange an interview with The New York Times, on the
condition that he be present.
</P>
<P>
   The men said they agreed to talk, to explain to relatives and
friends they can no longer see why they had dealt with mobsters,
and to express their willingness to accept punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, Mary Jo
White, declined to discuss Blutrich's and Pfeffer's cases. But
investigators and prosecutors described them as essential
witnesses. In November the FBI ended the undercover investigation
and whisked the two men away from the New York City area. They were
given new identities. Scores remains open under new management.
</P>
<P>
   Both are awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty in Florida to
fraud and in New York to making illegal payments to the Gambino
family. They each face up to 20 years in prison, but their
cooperation is expected to reduce their terms.

<P>
   From Successful Lawyer to Conspirator in Fraud
</P>
<P>
   Blutrich, 49, a stout man with a cherubic smile, grew up in
Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn. A child actor in the 1960s, he appeared
in television commercials and was an understudy for roles in the
Broadway musical ``The Sound of Music.'' After graduating from the
Georgetown University Law Center in 1974, he specialized in
representing entertainment and textile companies in arbitration
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   His legal career blossomed in 1982 when he became a founding
partner in Blutrich, Falcone &AMP; Miller with several former aides to
Gov. Mario Cuomo. Cuomo's son Andrew Cuomo, now the secretary of
housing and urban development, was a partner in the firm from 1985
to 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Outside his law practice, Blutrich dabbled in restaurant and
nightclub ventures in New Rochelle and Los Angeles. He also became
a boxing promoter.
</P>
<P>
   He became entangled in the insurance fraud in 1990 when he was
hired by three Florida businessmen seeking control of National
Heritage Insurance Co. in Orlando, Fla., whose main business was
selling annuities. Blutrich would later admit that he helped the
businessmen take over National Heritage by setting up a phony bank
account and providing them with a fake check for $4 million when
their assets barely totaled $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say the three men gained control of the company's
assets as soon as they turned over the check, and then dipped into
the company's own funds to cover the check before it bounced. Two
of the men have been convicted, and a third is awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   Blutrich soon began reaping dividends from National Heritage.
His clients, now the company's top officials, lent him $300,000 as
seed money to open Scores. One of them, David L. Davies, became
chief executive of National Heritage and invested $700,000 of his
own money as the secret but principal partner of Scores, Blutrich
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that in the summer of 1991, while Scores was under
construction, he was approached by Michael Sergio, whom he knew as
a restaurateur in New York City and Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had heard through the grapevine that Sergio was connected to
the Gambinos,'' Blutrich said. The restaurateur, he asserted, told
him that John Gotti, the head of the family, was demanding payoffs
from anyone opening a nightclub at the site Blutrich had picked for
the club. ``Sergio said that certain accommodations would have to
be made; otherwise they were ready to go with a bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   The accommodations, Blutrich said, included giving the Gambino
family about $200,000 a year in profits from the coat-check room
and valet parking. Blutrich said the Gambino family also demanded
$1,000 a week in cash and the right to choose the club's bouncers.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he did not abandon Scores at that point, Blutrich
said: ``I wanted to open and run a sophisticated, upscale club. If
I did not accede to their demands, there would not have been a
Scores.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Brevetti, a lawyer for Sergio, 66, declined to comment on
the allegations against him. The indictment, on charges of
racketeering and extortion, lists Sergio as an associate of the
Gambino family. He is being held without bail while awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   Club Turns a Profit, Despite Shakedowns
</P>
<P>
   Scores, which features topless dancers and big-screen television
sets tuned to sports, opened on Oct. 31, 1991, at 333 East 60th St.
About this time, Blutrich and Pfeffer met and their business worlds
began to merge.
</P>
<P>
   The slim, 39-year-old Pfeffer was reared in the upper-income
milieu of Scarsdale, and while in college he opened a string of car
washes. Later, he advanced into more sophisticated enterprises:
pooling investments for real-estate deals and supervising mortgage
portfolios for investment companies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, through Blutrich's introductions, National Heritage
gave hefty commissions to Pfeffer for managing the company's
real-estate investments and for finding buyers for its holdings.
</P>
<P>
   For the first year, Blutrich said, Scores was hemorrhaging red
ink, and by late 1992 Davies of National Heritage wanted out.
Blutrich's solution was to bring in Pfeffer as the chief investor
and to manage the club's finances.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeffer said he relished the idea of overseeing a popular
nightclub that attracted show business and sports figures. He took
over as executive manager, with Blutrich remaining as his main
partner and the club's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Before buying into the club, Pfeffer said: ``I had to meet Mike
Sergio, and he basically laid out the situation'' _ that the club
was under the control of the Gambino family. ``He kissed me on the
cheek and told me, `You could be the boss, but remember, you're the
boss because I let you.'''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Scores case indictment, from 1991 to 1997,
Gambino family members extorted more than $1 million from the
owners and employees.
</P>
<P>
   Blutrich and Pfeffer said most of their links to the Gambino
family arose through dealings with Sergio and Craig DePalma, 32, a
co-defendant in the Scores case whom the indictment described as a
Gambino soldier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any claim that money was passed through Craig DePalma, we deny
categorically,'' said John W. Mitchell, DePalma's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the payoffs, Blutrich and Pfeffer said the club was
profitable under them, grossing more than $1 million a year after
its shaky financial start. Both said the mobsters tried to increase
their loot by controlling almost every aspect of the club's
operations, including choosing the toilet-paper supplier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them were scary,'' Pfeffer said of the Gambino family
members who frequently went to the club. ``They talked about
blowing away people with shotguns and told us, with smiles on their
faces, how easy it would be for them to kill us.''
</P>
<P>
   The mobsters rarely paid for meals and drinks, Pfeffer and
Blutrich said. They would also pick up cash left on tables by
customers and tell waiters, ```It's on the house; they're friends
of ours.''' Pfeffer recalled.
</P>
<P>
   When Pfeffer objected to some of the mobsters' actions, he said,
he got crude threats. After one such incident, he walked into his
apartment and found a bullet on his coffee table.

<P>
   Big Spenders Caught in Trap Meant for Mob
</P>
<P>
   The first sign of legal trouble for Blutrich and Pfeffer came in
1994, when insurance regulators closed National Heritage after
uncovering a maze of embezzlements, worthless investments, assets
inflated to conceal losses, and suspected kickbacks to company
officials for authorizing secret loans.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 and 1997, a federal grand jury in Florida indicted
Blutrich, Pfeffer, Davies and 13 others on fraud and conspiracy
charges that led to a loss of about $400 million for the company,
which went out of business in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Davies, who pleaded guilty to the charges, is serving a six-year
prison sentence. He has never been implicated in the Scores case.
</P>
<P>
   Blutrich and Pfeffer pleaded guilty to bilking the company of
about $13 million in illegal payments to themselves and others.
Malman, Pfeffer's lawyer, said both men lost almost all the money
on bad investments and wildly extravagant lifestyles that included
$1,000-an-hour helicopter flights and lavish restaurant parties
with mobsters and celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1996, four months after Blutrich and Pfeffer were
indicted in Florida, federal and state investigators raided Scores
as part of a separate investigation of Gambino family rackets in
the New York area. They also raided the Scores offices that
Blutrich and Pfeffer shared at 3 Park Ave.
</P>
<P>
   A week after the raids, both men agreed to work undercover for
the authorities. They did so after learning that they had been
ensnared in a broad investigation of the Gambino family.
</P>
<P>
   A Year of Pretense and Ominous Threats
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the Florida indictments helped the two men in their
undercover roles. ``It gave us more credibility,'' Pfeffer
explained. ``The mob guys thought that nobody who gets indicted is
cooperating, and they offered to help us raise bail and find
lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were edgy moments. At meetings concerning Scores
payoffs and the investigation, Blutrich and Pfeffer said, the
mobsters often put guns on the table or ostentatiously displayed
their weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told us not to worry about the guns,'' Pfeffer recalled.
``They said, `It's only for rats.'''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the cooperation agreement, the FBI installed
concealed video cameras and microphones in Pfeffer's Park Avenue
office. Outside the office, both men had recording devices under
their clothes, in their cars and in cellular telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Some mobsters, Blutrich and Pfeffer said, would playfully pat
them or unbutton their shirts before beginning conversations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a year of unbearable tension,'' said Blutrich. ``They
came pretty close a couple of times to finding the wires on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Blutrich, who is divorced, and Pfeffer, who is married and has a
13-year-old daughter from a previous marriage, said they expected
to receive lighter sentences in return for cooperating, but were
given no assurances by prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   In prison, like other witnesses in Mafia cases, they will be
confined in segregated cell blocks out of concern for their safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't start out as criminals, but we were fast-track guys
who were out to make lots of money,'' Pfeffer said. ``By working
undercover we tried to make up for the wrong things we had done,
but as a consequence we'll be looking over our shoulders for the
rest of our lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think,'' he added, ``there will be happy endings for
us.''

RUSSIAN LEADERS PLAY DOWN ACCORD WITH COMMUNISTS

<P>
   MOSCOW _ With President Clinton's arrival for a summit meeting
just days away, Russia's ad-hoc leadership sought to telegraph a
message of stability Saturday, saying neither economic crisis nor
political bargaining with Communist legislators presages a return
to Soviet-style fiscal policy.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Russian journalists, Acting Prime Minister
Victor Chernomyrdin said he intended to take a number of steps
urged by western economists to stem Russia's slide toward
insolvency, including a crackdown on the illegal export of dollars
and other foreign currencies and a pledge to keep the ruble
convertible on Russian and world markets.
</P>
<P>
   The government has all but frozen the ruble in recent days,
shutting down the interbank currency exchange and refusing to
supply banks with dollars. But Chernomyrdin said that the value of
the ruble would be stabilized and that the thousands of local
currency exchanges in Russia _ a symbol to ordinary citizens that
the ruble has a real value _ would remain open.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are already part of the world economy,'' the official
Itar-Tass news agency quoted Chernomyrdin as saying. ``We will not
revert to the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin's remarks lent some weight to statements made
Friday by the International Monetary Fund that Russia still
recognizes the need for continued Western-style economic reforms if
it is to avoid fiscal collapse and, perhaps, social chaos. The fund
is in the midst of a $22.6 billion bailout of the Russian
government, but has warned that it will not proceed with the next
step in that plan _ a $4.3 billion loan scheduled for late next
month _ unless reforms continue.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Saturday's assurances seemed undercut by
Chernomyrdin's other overtures _ to the Communists who are the main
force in the Russian Parliament and who want to abandon the fund's
policies and return to running the economy through government
control of industries and banks.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, President Boris Yeltsin dismissed his government's
top negotiator with Western bankers and lending institutions,
Anatoly Chubais, perhaps the man most trusted by Western
negotiators in the long and, so far, fruitless effort to rescue the
economy. A successor has not been announced.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently at Chernomyrdin's instruction, Yeltsin's emissary to
the Parliament plans to sign an agreement on Sunday with the
Communists that essentially calls for coordinating economic policy
with them and other parliamentary factions. The accord also
proposes changes in Russia's Constitution that would cede some of
Yeltsin's immense powers to the Parliament and the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist speaker of the Duma, the lower house of
Parliament, is Gennadi Seleznyov, who has represented the
Communists in drafting the agreement. He said on Friday that some
return of the economy to state control is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone understands that, as we are trying to get Russia out
of crisis, the role of the government must be strengthened,''
Seleznyov said.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists' leader, Gennadi Zyuganov, has demanded even
greater control over the economy in return for the party's votes to
confirm Chernomyrdin as prime minister. But despite those
reservations, the party appears prepared to sign on to the deal,
clearing the way to confirm Chernomyrdin on Monday or Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday a chorus of Western leaders spoke out on the Russian
situation, and all made it clear that Chernomyrdin would receive no
further help unless he remained faithful to reform.
</P>
<P>
   German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, for example, said he planned
``personally to use our influence to drum into Yeltsin and his team
that they will not solve the crisis without reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin was not to be seen Saturday. Aides said he was resting
at one of his summer houses outside Moscow, preparing for Clinton's
arrival in Moscow on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   His negotiator with the Parliament, Aleksandr Kotenkov, told a
news conference in Moscow Saturday that Yeltsin was compromising
with his old foes in Parliament because ``taking an uncompromising
stand in the period of a crisis would be immoral.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's supporters had worked into the deal with Parliament a
clause guaranteeing that the president and his family would not be
prosecuted for any crimes after his departure from office. Many
believed the clause was inserted to ease the way toward his
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   But Kotenkov said Saturday that Yeltsin, who says he has no
plans to quit, had ordered the language removed form the agreement.
``Boris Nikolayevich does not need the Duma's charity,'' he said. &QL;

THEIR ECONOMY UNRAVELING, PAKISTANIS WONDER IF GOVERNMENT IS NEXT 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ During such a tumultuous week, it might be
expected that people here were preoccupied by the U.S. missile
attack in neighboring Afghanistan. After all, dozens of Pakistanis
were among those killed in the barrage that fell on what the United
States says were terrorist training camps.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not the case, for people in Pakistan have concerns
far more immediate.
</P>
<P>
   The world's newest nuclear power also has one of the world's
worst credit ratings, and with the possibility of default looming
on its $30 billion foreign debt, Pakistan's economy is quickly
coming unspooled. Many people here, whether pundits or politicians
or shopkeepers, say they believe that the government itself may
unravel next.
</P>
<P>
   With confidence in Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in a seeming free
fall, it is common to hear predictions that something dramatic is
about to occur, though people are at a loss to suggest what that
might be. They refer to what has happened elsewhere: social unrest
in Indonesia; the emergence of theocratic states in Iran and
Afghanistan. They mention a familiar staple of Pakistan's past: the
military takeover.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is an economic meltdown, as many say, Pakistanis who
have stashed money away overseas _ or who have relatives living
overseas _ are likely to leave,'' said Abida Hussain, a former
ambassador to the United States and now a member of Sharif's
Cabinet. ``The institutional framework of government, already so
stressed out, might come under unbearable pressure. Radical
religious elements would try to profit off this.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, people ask if the military would take over.
I'll quote the answer given me by a young officer who is my friend.
I asked him, `Do you guys have the guts to impose military rule?'
And he said: `Of course, we do. But what would we get out of it but
a lot of criticism?' The military's choices are no less grim than
the government's.''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, those with the grimmest of choices are the nation's
poor. Abdul Khaliq, 35, is a barber in the working-class city of
Rawalpindi, near Islamabad, Pakistan's ornamented capital. ``The
feudal landlords and politicians have looted our country until
there is nothing more to loot and they leave us with nothing but
our poverty,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Khaliq's barber shop is an 8-by-8-foot room with a single chair.
Electrical wires, frayed as old rope, hang from the ceiling. He has
halved the price of a haircut to about 33 cents, but customers
seldom venture inside. ``They have no money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Next door is a tiny vegetable stand run by Mohammad Farooq, 42.
His shelves are stocked with only small amounts of ginger, tomatoes
and cabbage. People have been buying much less these last few
weeks. The price of onions has doubled. Potatoes have tripled.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is a man to do in a country like Pakistan, get a rifle,
kill yourself, kill your family, kill someone else?'' he said
angrily. ``My wife has pains in her ear. Medicine helps, but I have
no money for medicine. I tell her she must live with the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   While foreign news programs repeatedly showed Pakistanis
protesting against the U.S. missile attack, such rallies have been
few and quite small. Even now, many people in Rawalpindi have never
heard of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born millionaire whom the
United States believes was behind the bombings of the U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Certainly, the vast majority never
knew who he was before the week before last.
</P>
<P>
   The man most people speak of is Sharif, who was elected by a
huge margin in February 1997 but has recently found his popularity
plunging. Voters, a discouraged lot, had at the very least presumed
him to be less dishonest than his predecessor, Benazir Bhutto, who
faces corruption charges in Pakistan and in Switzerland. Many also
supposed that a millionaire industrialist might know something
about running a government.
</P>
<P>
   But these days even a supporter like Ms. Hussain, the minister
for population welfare and science and technology, is spare in her
praise of Sharif's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``This government is probably cleaner than any in the past,''
she said. ``But the cleanliness is at the top. Lower down, it's
business as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   In its 51-year history, Pakistan has been a democracy only
sporadically, with elected governments trading turns with military
dictatorships. Corruption seems an unbreakable habit: politicians
gorge at the public trough, landowners and industrialists refuse to
repay mammoth loans from national banks, less than 1 percent of the
population pays income tax. Almost 70 percent of the budget goes
toward interest on debt or for the military.
</P>
<P>
   These conditions have created a shaky economic scaffolding.
Nevertheless, Pakistan, with about half the population of the
United States, has usually managed to muddle through by begging and
borrowing _ and forever promising to clean up its act.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif has made such promises, and while even his critics say he
has made some progress, his efforts at reform strike most as
insufficiently bold.
</P>
<P>
   With his support withering, and the economy already slowed by
Asia's economic crisis, Sharif enjoyed a spurt in popularity after
May 28, when Pakistan spurned United States offers of financial aid
and tested nuclear bombs, matching earlier trials by its enemy,
India.
</P>
<P>
   The United States imposed economic sanctions on both nations,
and the International Monetary Fund suspended disbursements _
castigations that have been harder on Pakistan than its rival.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif implored his countrymen to economize, to drink two cups
of tea a day instead of three, to cook with one spoonful of oil
instead of two. He announced ways to raise revenue, including the
recovery of those billions in loans owed by the country's elite.
</P>
<P>
   But efforts to collect have largely been a flop, a failure all
the more irritating to the public since among the well-heeled
deadbeats was the prime minister. He has refused to repay his loans
with cash, instead turning over assets that critics say he has
overvalued. Calls for a comment from Sharif's information minister
were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Desperate for revenues, the government increased prices for
petroleum and electricity. At the same time, the value of the rupee
has plunged by 30 percent. Inflation has hit hard.
</P>
<P>
   With $3 billion in foreign debt coming due, Pakistan is in
danger of defaulting. Last Wednesday, the United States expressed
support for a deal among international lenders that would rescue
Pakistan from its payments crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Such last-ditch debt-juggling has saved Pakistan in the past,
and while the IMF and others usually demand economic reforms to
accompany their loans, many complain that such requirements are
half-heartedly enforced here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IMF and the World Bank bend over backward to appease these
regimes,'' said Najam Sethi, editor of a weekly newspaper, The
Friday Times. ``At every step of the way, the government lies to
these agencies and the agencies surely know they are being lied
to.''
</P>
<P>
   But it has been difficult for the West to forsake a place like
Pakistan, with so many illiterate people and so little health care.
This is all the more true now that the nation is carrying a tin cup
in one hand and nuclear bombs in the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pakistan and its creditors are locked in this unfortunate,
self-defeating embrace,'' said Paula Newberg, an author who has
written extensively about Pakistan. ``What appears to be convenient
in the short term may be worse for the long term. This pattern of
bailouts keeps getting repeated, and in the meantime Pakistan's
structural problems are never solved.''
</P>
<P>
   In the narrow stalls of the Rawalpindi market, with haggard old
men and bony horses pulling heavy carts through the streets, people
wonder if some virtuous Islamic leader might come along to save the
country. Mohammad Jameel, 40, a shopkeeper, said he would welcome a
fundamentalist government, but then was unable to name any Islamic
leader he would deem worthy. Pakistan does have fundamentalist
Islamic parties. They have yet to fare well in elections.
</P>
<P>
   In what some here see as cynical politics, Sharif has begun to
portray himself as newly zealous. Friday, in a speech before
Parliament, he said the cure for the nation's social ills was a
constitutional amendment to makes its laws more closely reflect
Islamic teachings.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan's Muslims are split among Sunnis and Shiites, with the
Sunnis in the great majority, as they are in almost all
predominantly Muslim countries. Yet even within these groups, there
are sects. They would be hard to unify under any banner, let alone
a fundamentalist one. Most Pakistanis prefer less-strict
interpretations of the holy Koran.
</P>
<P>
   ``The armed forces are a deciding factor, and I don't think they
would welcome an Islamic resurgence,'' said Aziz Sidique of the
Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, a private group, in Lahore.
``I wouldn't rule out a military takeover. What has prevented it so
far is that now they have the opportunity to influence decisions
without taking responsibility for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not so appealing to take responsibility these days in
Pakistan.''

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   EXP-RUSSIA-YUPPIES (Moscow) _ These are dizzy days for Moscow's
yuppies, who have grown used to big salaries, often paid in
dollars, from the banks, foreign firms, real estate companies and

years. Many of these people are so young that they have known
nothing but well-paid, white-collar jobs. By Celestine Bohlen.
</P>
<P>
   EXP-INDIA-TEMPLE (Ayodhya, India) _ The crusade for a temple to
Ram on the very place where a mosque once stood has been central to
the political ascendancy of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata
Party, which now leads the Indian government. And it has posed one
of the gravest challenges ever to modern India's 50-year tradition
as a secular nation committed to treating people of all faiths
justly. By Celia W. Dugger.
</P>
<P>
   EXP-PAKISTAN-TURMOIL (Islamabad, Pakistan) _ During such a
tumultuous week, it might be expected that people here were

quickly coming unspooled. By Barry Bearak.

</P>
<P>
   EXP-MEXICO-POLITICS (Mexico City) _ The exhilaration of ending

got down to business last September. But the celebration did not
last long. By Anthony DePalma.
</P>
<P>
   EXP-PANAMA-VOTE (Panama) _ Officially, only the destiny of
President Ernesto Perez Balladares will be decided when people vote
Sunday on a proposal that would amend the Constitution here and
allow him to seek a second consecutive term. But the future of the
Panama Canal may also be at stake, so the campaign here has turned
extraordinarily ferocious.
</P>
<P>
   EXP-RUSSIA-GERMANY (Frankfurt, Germany) _ Locked in a tight
national election campaign, German political leaders are coldly
reappraising their longstanding willingness to bankroll Russia and
to support its president, Boris Yeltsin. By Edmund L. Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   EXP-PILOT-STRIKE (Minneapolis) _ More than 6,000 pilots began a

Laurence Zuckerman.
</P>
<P>

   EXP-INTERNET-DEPRESSION _ In the first concentrated study of the

who spend even a few hours a week online experience higher levels
of depression and loneliness than they would have if they used the
computer network less frequently. By Amy Harmon.
</P>
<P>
   EXP-BUDGET-SURPLUS (Washington) _ While booming stock prices
contributed importantly to the government's now-certain budget
surplus for 1998 _ the first in almost 30 years _ the market's
recent swoon poses little threat so far to the nation's hard-won
return to fiscal integrity. By Robert D. Hershey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   EXP-CLINTON-STARR (Washington) _ In the two weeks since
President Clinton acknowledged having had an inappropriate
relationship with Monica Lewinsky, the capital's attention has been
riveted by the prospect of an impeachment report that official
Washington assumes independent counsel Kenneth Starr will send to
the House of Representatives. Never mind that Starr has not even
said that his prosecutors are writing a report. By Don Van Natta
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   EXP-COLO-MASSACRE-SITE (Chivington, Colo.) _ One historian calls
it the American My Lai. But 134 years after 700 U.S. Army
volunteers stormed through an Indian encampment near here on the
Big Sandy Creek, slaughtering scores of women and children,
Colorado's killing fields have disappeared into the swirling dust
and endless horizons of big sky country. By James Brooke.
</P>
<P>
   EXP-MASS-MIRACLEGIRL (Worcester, Mass.) _ Audrey Santo has been
bedridden for 11 years, in a condition that leaves her inert and
unspeaking, the legacy of an accidental fall into a backyard
swimming pool. But because some who have visited here claimed to
have been cured of illnesses, she is said by her family _ and by a
growing number of devotees _ to be a mystic and a ``victim soul''
who takes on the suffering of people who ask her to intercede with
God, relaying their pleas for healing. By Gustav Niebuhr.
</P>
<P>
   EXP-NEA-REVIVAL (Washington) _ In the days since the House voted
to spare the National Endowment for the Arts, and made clear that
the stay of execution was more or less permanent, the new chairman
of the agency has begun talking out loud about all that suddenly
seems possible: more money, less rancor, even ``a New Deal without
the Depression, with murals painted all over the country and music
composed.'' By Melinda Henneberger.

   WORCESTER, Mass. _ About 75 people have come as pilgrims to the
Santo home, a cream-colored ranch house on a quiet cul-de-sac here.
In small groups, they take turns crowding into a back room, where
they can gaze through a glass pane at a 14-year-old girl who lies
motionless in bed in a room hung with pictures of Jesus and the
Virgin Mary.
</P>
<P>
   Many have waited a year or more for this moment. In recent
months, so many others have signed up to visit that the waiting
list stretches into the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Audrey Santo has been bedridden for 11 years, in a condition
that leaves her inert and unspeaking, the legacy of an accidental
fall into a backyard swimming pool. But because some who have
visited here claimed to have been cured of illnesses, she is said
by her family _ and by a growing number of devotees _ to be a
mystic and a ``victim soul'' who takes on the suffering of people
who ask her to intercede with God, relaying their pleas for
healing.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, when the 75 pilgrims visited, her brown eyes
were open, her face turned slightly to one side, and a long sweep
of dark hair trailed across the bedsheets.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not moving; she's not talking,'' her mother, Linda
Santo, told the group beforehand in the backyard, where a Mass was
celebrated later. ``She's in that room with her Jesus seven days a
week, adoring him, waiting on him, serving him, and he's blessing
her.''
</P>
<P>
   What is occurring here, which is under investigation by the
Roman Catholic Diocese of Worcester, may be unique in its details.
But in one sense, it fits within a broader pattern. For all the
secular materialism that distinguishes late 20th-century culture,
belief in the miraculous, in divine signs and wonders, remains very
much alive.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 150 years, along with the rise of
industrialization, capitalism and democracy, there have been more
claims of appearances by the Virgin Mary to individuals than at any
time since the Middle Ages, said R. Scott Appleby, director of the
Cushwa Center for the Study of American Catholicism at the
University of Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1981, tens of thousands of people have braved everything
from rough roads and the threat of warfare to travel to the Bosnian
village of Medjugorje, where six young people have claimed to
receive messages from the Virgin Mary, calling people to prayer.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Church has taken no official position on that case.
But in a few earlier instances _ at La Salette, France, in 1846;
Lourdes, France, in 1858; and Fatima, Portugal, in 1917 _ the
church has pronounced apparitions as authentic, while also saying
that Catholics are free to believe in them or not.
</P>
<P>
   Among those visiting the Santos' home, some see a divine pattern
at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Lord is calling people back to prayer, to believe
that he truly does exist, to live a humble and simple life,'' said
Bob Bevelacqua, 57, a jeweler from Plainville, Mass. ``I think all
this started many, many years ago at La Salette.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Lee Sheehan, 58, of Medway, Mass., said she believed that
God was ``using Audrey to bring people back to him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Santo family says that a light-colored oil mysteriously
appears in their house, dripping from statues and religious
paintings.
</P>
<P>
   On four occasions, at Masses celebrated at the home, the family
says, blood appeared on the eucharistic hosts, the communion wafers
consecrated by the priest as the body of Christ. ``The message
here,'' Mrs. Santo said to the pilgrims, ``which Audrey
disseminates to the world, is that there is life in the eucharist.
God exists in the eucharist.''
</P>
<P>
   During Mass last Wednesday, a large photograph of the four
wafers was displayed. Later, several priests brought the wafers
out, enclosed in small metal cases, so the pilgrims could kiss the
glass covers.
</P>
<P>
   As Audrey's story has spread, it has drawn people to Worcester.
Attendance has risen at an annual Mass on the anniversary of the
accident that caused her condition, when she fell into a swimming
pool on Aug. 9, 1987. In 1996, several hundred people went to a
nearby church. In 1997, about 4,000 showed up. This year, to
accommodate crowds, the Mass took place at the stadium of Holy
Cross College here.
</P>
<P>
   An attendee at the mass, James McCartin, a resident of Troy,
N.Y., and a graduate student at Notre Dame, said in a telephone
interview that Audrey was taken onto the field in an ambulance and
placed in a small house with a window, through which she could be
seen. One man declared that he had been cured of cancer by praying
to Audrey, McCartin said. The crowd prayed for the girl's recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Bishop Daniel Reilly of Worcester appointed two
psychologists and a theologian to investigate Audrey's case. The
three have sought advice from pediatricians, psychologists and
neurologists. They have also met with Audrey's caregivers, past and
present.
</P>
<P>
   The diocese's spokesman, Raymond Delisle, said he expected a
report to be delivered to Reilly soon. What the bishop must
determine, he said, is whether claims made about Audrey contradict
church doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church never gets into a position where it's going to be a
proponent of these things,'' Delisle said. ``The strongest it's
going to say is, we find there's nothing problematic about the
faithful attending a Mass'' at the Santos' house.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked whether miraculous claims, like the ones made
around Audrey Santo, posed a problem for the diocese.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult for any bishop,'' Delisle said. In cases like
this one, a prelate may find himself caught between true believers
and ardent skeptics. That, Delisle said, is ``a tough middle
ground.''

<P>
   The Santo family does not charge a fee to pilgrims for the
visits, which take place on Wednesdays. But access is regulated by
a volunteer organization, the Apostolate of a Silent Soul Inc.,
which publishes a monthly newsletter and sells a videotape, ``The
Story of Little Audrey Santo.'' A brief biography of Audrey,
prepared by the organization, states that the stigmata, the wounds
Jesus received at his crucifixion, have appeared on the girl during
Catholic holy days.
</P>
<P>
   One of the group's members, Mary Cormier, who moved here a month
ago from New Hampshire, serves as the Santos' spokeswoman. As she
tells it, Audrey, the youngest of four children, was a lively and
pious little girl before the accident. Pulled from the pool, she
was revived and rushed to a hospital, but later lapsed into a coma,
Mrs. Cormier said.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks later, she said, Audrey emerged from the coma and
now lives in a state called akinetic mutism. She is fed through a
tube in her stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Medical textbooks define akinetic mutism as often linked to
damage to the brain's frontal lobes. One book on clinical neurology
states that such a patient has ``sleep-waking cycles but, when
apparently awake, with eyes open, lies mute, immobile and
unresponsive.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last four years, Audrey has been treated by Dr. John
Harding, a pediatrician in private practice. ``She's not in a
complete coma, where she's only responsive to pain,'' he said.
``She kind of gives you the impression at various times that she
sees, hears and knows who you are.''
</P>
<P>
   He calls it ``a gray area,'' where one cannot be sure what she
hears or understands. But like Audrey's mother, Harding said he
regarded the girl as a living statement ``of the value of human
life.'' And he said he had the impression that ``something
supernatural'' was occurring in the Santo house.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, accompanied by a nurse, Linda Santo took Audrey to
Medjugorje to seek a divine cure. According the apostolate's
biographical statement, mother and daughter were present when the
young visionaries said they saw Mary. ``During the apparition,
Linda sensed that her daughter was in some way communicating with
the Mother of God,'' says the statement, which also says that
shortly thereafter, Audrey suffered cardiac arrest and had to be
flown home on a medical airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Audrey is attended round-the-clock by nurses and family members,
who talk and read to her, and show her television programs. The
family receives letters from people seeking the girl's help for
healing. ``And it's important to know,'' Mrs. Cormier said, ``that
every single letter that comes to this house is read by her Mom,
and then read to Audrey by her nurses or her Mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors are shown a garage that has been converted into a
chapel. Inside are pictures of the Virgin Mary and religious
statues, some stained with the oily substance that the family says
appears without explanation. Small signs ask people not to touch,
but promise, ``Jesus and Mary will touch you.'' &QL;

CLINTON STAYING OUT OF NORTHWEST STRIKE, FOR NOW
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. _ President Clinton refused early Saturday
morning to intervene in the Northwest Airlines pilots' strike,
urging both sides to iron out their differences on their own.
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials said that if the strike extended
into the Labor Day weekend and appeared to be causing widespread
inconvenience, the president would reconsider his decision.
</P>
<P>
   If the strike warrants presidential intervention, Clinton will
act, said White House spokesman Barry Toiv. ``I won't get into what
specific factors would need to change for him to act,'' Toiv told
reporters after the strike began Saturday at 12:01 a.m. ``But the
president wants both sides to stay at the table and negotiate.''
</P>
<P>
   Toiv said he would not ``put a time-frame'' on how long Clinton
would refrain from acting, but other officials said they were
waiting to see how much the strike would disrupt domestic travel
during the normally busy Labor Day weekend. This year, however,
school is starting in many areas before Labor Day, which could ease
the traditional holiday traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Railway Labor Act, the president can stop a strike by
ordering a 60-day ``cooling off'' period if he finds the walkout
would pose a ``substantial economic threat'' and deprive a region
of a ``central transportation service.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration has been sending signals for days that it
would not step in, and while the airline made contingency plans,
both sides had reason to think he might intercede. Clinton set a
precedent of sorts last year when he stepped in minutes after 9,300
pilots at American Airlines walked off the job. It was the first
time a president had halted an airline strike since 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials here, where the president is wrapping
up a two-week vacation, and in Washington said there were enough
differences between the American strike and the Northwest walkout
to justify the president's hands-off approach this time.
</P>
<P>
   American, the nation's No. 2 carrier, is much bigger and has a
broader reach across the country; Northwest, the nation's
fourth-largest carrier, is concentrated in the upper Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also tricky political considerations for the
president. The American pilots were nonunion. The Northwest pilots
are part of the Air Line Pilots Association, an affiliation of the
AFL-CIO, which has been one of the president's strongest political
allies and is among the biggest financial contributors to the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Intervention would be perceived as an anti-labor move because it
would keep the company in business and reduce the clout of the
workers who wanted to walk out.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has split politicians in the region served by
Northwest. The governors of seven Midwestern states, most of them
Republicans, asked Clinton to intervene, saying a Northwest strike
could cost their economies hundreds of millions of dollars in the
first week alone.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, 24 Democratic members of Congress, all of them
with strong ties to labor, wrote to the president and urged him not
to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, by repeatedly intervening in such strikes, the
president could make a charade of the bargaining process.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't think that every time a company comes down to a
possible airline strike situation that the president should
automatically intervene,'' Toiv said. ``It's been rare in the past
and it needs to be rare, otherwise parties will take it for granted
and not take it seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilots are seeking a 15 percent wage increase, greater job
security and secured vacation time. Northwest countered their
arguments in a full-page advertisement in The New York Times that
said the pilots already are adequately paid. The advertisement said
that under the current contract offer, the average pilot would earn
$150,000 a year working 14 days a month. ``It's time to be
reasonable,'' the advertisement said. &QL;

PASSENGERS BOOKED ON NORTHWEST FACE FEW OPTIONS

   Passengers booked on Northwest Airlines flights are facing
serious disruptions and delays because of the pilots' strike
against the carrier. Many may be unable to get alternative flights,
even to get home, until after the strike.
</P>
<P>
   The strike has grounded Northwest's entire fleet, and 1,700
daily flights have been canceled. Northwest's commuter airlines,
Mesaba and Express Airlines I, have also stopped flying.
</P>
<P>
   Rival airlines will be able to carry only a limited number of
Northwest's passengers because many carriers are already booked
near capacity because of summer travel. Kiwi Airlines, however,
plans to add two daily flights a day between Newark and
Minneapolis, beginning Sunday, and Japan Airlines said it might add
several flights between Honolulu and Tokyo or Osaka and between Los
Angeles and Tokyo. The Japan Airlines flights are expected to be
limited to Northwest passengers only.
</P>
<P>
   While travel agencies and airlines caution that seats will be
scarce during the strike, passengers who do not have reservations
or who have tickets only on Northwest stand their best chance of
obtaining a seat on other carriers if they can depart at off-peak
hours: before 7 a.m., late at night and between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   But those are rules of thumb, and whether flights are available
depends on the airline, day of the week and cities served by a
particular flight. Flights between New York and Chicago, or Atlanta
and New York, for example, often fill up at any hour. Flights
between Orlando, Fla., and the Northeast or Midwest are often sold
out. Nonstop flights between the East and West coasts are not only
more expensive than connecting flights but are usually more crowded
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even with a record number of passengers, airplanes are
rarely 100 percent full, so travelers willing to stand by long
enough may be able to get a seat. And travelers willing to fly a
roundabout route also improve their odds of eventually getting
where they want to go.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest passengers looking for additional information can
check the company's Web site at www.nwa.com or call (800) 225-2525.

SUMMIT MEETING VETERANS OFFER STRATEGY FOR RUSSIA VISIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also RUSSIA-SUMMIT, RUSSIA-GERMANY, RUSSIA-REASSURE,
RUSSIA-YUPPIES.)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Henry Kissinger says that if President Clinton
backed out of the summit meeting in Moscow, it would mean certain
political death for Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Brent Scowcroft says that it's a shame Clinton scheduled his
trip in the first place, but now he must live with the consequences
and get on the plane to Moscow on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Colin Powell says Clinton and Yeltsin will find some way to
declare their summit meeting a success _ if the Russian government
doesn't collapse first.
</P>
<P>
   But Zbigniew Brzezinski says Clinton should stay home for now.
</P>
<P>
   The four men, all of them former national security advisers,
agree that the best sort of summit meeting between Washington and
Moscow is a well-rehearsed production combining the right blend of
substantive talk, pleasant photographs, warm toasts, inevitable
posturing and even a signed agreement or two, all scripted in
detail in advance.
</P>
<P>
   After all, taken together, the four have strategized and spun,
argued and ad-libbed their way through two decades of summit
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   But with Russia gripped by political and economic turmoil on the
eve of Clinton's trip to Moscow, the national security veterans
acknowledged in telephone interviews that they cannot recall
another summit meeting quite like this. So it is not at all
surprising that they do not agree on exactly what Clinton can or
should say, what the outcome will be, or even whether he should go.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the president didn't go now it would be the last nail in
Yeltsin's coffin,'' said Kissinger, who served as both national
security adviser and secretary of state under Richard Nixon. ``It
would say that the foreign leader who has shown the most consistent
confidence in Yeltsin has lost faith in his ability to deliver. I
don't want it to be perceived that the final excuse for Yeltsin
being dumped is Clinton's withdrawal from him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kissinger added that Clinton has no life-support system to
take to Yeltsin or his country. ``The president can offer nothing
concrete to Yeltsin that I can imagine,'' Kissinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Scowcroft, the national security adviser in the Bush
administration, said that if he were still sitting behind his old
desk in the White House, he ``would have told the president a few
months back: `Don't schedule that trip. There's nothing either side
can get from the trip that makes a meeting worthwhile.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But at this point, he added, it's too late. ``To cancel it now
would be one more blow to Yeltsin,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean the summit meeting is destined to accomplish
anything, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trouble is that when the two of them sit at a table and
look at each other, what are they going to do?'' Scowcroft
continued. ``You folks in the media are going to have a field day
writing about two mortally wounded leaders sitting around trying to
figure out how to get back into the good graces of their people.
Even if they did reach some agreement, neither one can carry it
out.''
</P>
<P>
   For Powell, who served in the Reagan White House as national
security adviser and as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff under
both Bush and Clinton, serious work could go a long way in helping
to justify the summit meeting and make both leaders look good.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the time to look for nice photo ops and the
theatrics and visuals that we used to work so hard for at a
summit,'' he said. ``This has to be the most businesslike summit
ever.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Summits are usually recoverable. Both leaders always want a
successful summit and I'm sure both leaders will claim this one a
success.''
</P>
<P>
   But Powell made his prediction with one big caveat _ that
``nothing disastrous happens,'' he said. In other words, that the
Russian government outlasts the summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not hoping for or expecting it,'' he said. ``Yeltsin has
shown remarkable political skill at getting himself out of tight
spots.''
</P>
<P>
   Scowcroft is not quite so charitable in his assessment of the
Russian leader. ``Yeltsin quite clearly has periods of dementia,''
he said. ``I don't know how frequently or how long they last. But
it's not clear how much Yeltsin is in charge of Yeltsin.''
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger agreed with Powell's assessment that this was the
moment to put an end to summit meetings of backslapping and
guffawing. In fact, Kissinger suggested that Clinton could seize
the opportunity to infuse the relationship with Russia with a more
serious tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be the beginning of moving our relationship from what
I call a psychological one to a political one,'' Kissinger said.
``In every previous summit there's been a demonstrative camaraderie
between the two leaders, an almost playful camaraderie that creates
the impression that this is almost like a personal relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Kissinger and Powell stressed the advantages of casting as
wide a net as possible, with Clinton meeting with Viktor
Chernomyrdin, Yeltsin's choice for prime minister; leaders of
Russia's Parliament; and other political figures and would-be
leaders. Such meetings are on Clinton's agenda.

</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton should convey to all of them a view of a
permanent U.S.-Russian relationship that goes beyond Yeltsin,''
Kissinger said. ``We should stress that Russia is a potential great
power, but that there is nothing we can do if Russia doesn't have a
serious reform program.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Eagleburger, a deputy secretary and secretary of state
under Bush, suggested a blunter message than did Kissinger, his
former boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president should say, `Listen, the guys who did the reform
business really screwed it up,''' Eagleburger said in a telephone
interview. `` `Corruption is awful and if you really want any more
help from us you're going to have to prove you're serious.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Eagleburger would also like to see serious talk about arms
control, but added that in the current climate, ``It's not going to
make much difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, said Eagleburger: ``Clinton should go. Why would he not
go?''
</P>
<P>
   Brzezinski, the national security adviser under Jimmy Carter,
the last Democratic president before Clinton, had an answer for
that question. ``There is no government and there is no set policy
in Russia so what is there to talk about?'' Brzezinski said.
``Clinton is not going to save Yeltsin; Clinton is not going to
drown Yeltsin. They're both weakened and neither is in control of
the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as Brzezinski railed about how weak the current
Democrat in the White House is, Eagleburger, the one-time secretary
of state to a Republican president, wished that Clinton could be
made to look stronger as he heads to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trouble Clinton is going to have,'' Eagleburger said,
``and this drives me crazy even when it comes to my own
Republicans, is that we talk so much about him weakened that it
becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.''

LOANS TO RUSSIA BECOMING ISSUE IN GERMAN ELECTION

<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Locked in a tight national election
campaign, German political leaders are coldly reappraising their
longstanding willingness to bankroll Russia and to support its
president, Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the German
government has guaranteed about $30 billion worth of bank loans in
Russia, largely to finance construction projects, the sale of heavy
machinery and German investments in Russia. Beyond that, the
government has also pumped billions of dollars into development
projects.
</P>
<P>
   But Helmut Kohl, who has been Germany's chancellor for 16 years
and encouraged the German lending, is now in danger of being ousted
by the opposition Social Democratic Party in an election late next
month.
</P>
<P>
   Even without electoral pressures, he and other German political
and business leaders say it would be foolish to lend more money in
Russia until the country carries out reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Russian crisis has yet to surface as a significant
issue in the election campaign, the leader of the Social Democratic
Party was quick to charge that Kohl's policies had contributed to
the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Oskar Lafontaine, chairman of the Social Democrats, accused
Kohl's government of being so obsessed with increasing exports to
Russia that it had guaranteed billions of dollars' worth of bad
loans that would now have be paid with taxpayers' money.
</P>
<P>
   ``What have we actually achieved and with what risks?''
Lafontaine asked in a television interview scheduled for broadcast
on Sunday. ``It would have been better to send German companies in
to build a road, a railroad or a power station, instead of just
transferring money. We would change that policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohl and other political leaders here have also felt a special
moral obligation to Russia. A feeling of guilt remains from World
War II and Germany's invasion of Eastern Europe and the Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
   More important, Kohl continues to feel a powerful gratitude for
the role Moscow played in permitting the unification of East and
West Germany in 1990. The key to unification was the Russian
leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, who allowed Eastern European countries
to break away from communism and indicated to German leaders that a
unification of East and West Germany was conceivable.
</P>
<P>
   But faced with Russia's current crisis, Kohl said Saturday: ``We
can only help when we know that there is a completely clear program
with goals that would assure success. It is in the German interest
not to drive our most powerful neighbor in the east into a hopeless
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The roots of Germany's involvement in Russia are as much
political and historical as they are economic. Russia's sheer
proximity to Germany _ a few hundred miles from parts of its
eastern border _ makes it an important partner in much the way that
Mexico is important to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Germans import much of their natural gas from Russia, as do many
other European countries. And ever since Yeltsin came to power in
1991, Germany has been eager to expand trade eastward and to tap
what it had hoped would be the boom of a newly liberated giant.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although German banks are by far the heaviest lenders to Russia,
bank executives say that most of their lending has been to finance
the activities of German companies in Moscow. And even though the
perils of doing business in Russia have been well known, banks like
Deutsche Bank have pushed ahead to stake out a presence for
themselves in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Shaken by the magnitude and intractability of the Russian
financial crisis, German bankers now argue that extending more
credit without major reforms would be throwing good money after
bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody should be expecting expanded credits or help from the
German side,'' said Per Fischer, vice president in charge of
lending for Russia at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. ``All steps to
re-establish the creditworthiness of the Russian Central Bank and
the Russian government are of priority importance.''
</P>
<P>
   Another banker, who did not want to be identified, said the
German government's generosity in guaranteeing loans added to the
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the German government didn't fully see the risks
involved,'' he said. ``We kept pretending that they were going to
carry out the reforms they said they would, and they kept
pretending that they would respect our decisions. If ever there was
a case of obvious moral hazard, it was there.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Welfens, head of the European Institute for International
Economic Relations at the University of Potsdam, said that Germany
should have been tougher about insisting on reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Germany has been extremely generous financially,'' Welfens
said in an interview with Die Tageszeitung in Berlin. ``It would
have been much better if Russia had been helped in the development
of a law-based government and a functioning system of financial
oversight.''
</P>
<P>
   Most experts and government officials are confident that
Germany's own economy will not be significantly affected by the
Russian crisis. Though Germany is Russia's biggest trading partner,
trade with Russia accounts for only about 0.2 percent of the
country's total output. Indeed, German trade with Russia is
actually less than its trade with Poland or the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Though Germany's stock market has plunged in the last several
days, along with most other exchanges in the world, analysts say
the decline reflects a much broader anxiety that stock markets had
become overheated and were due for a correction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia was really the straw that broke the camel's back,''
said Rainer Siegkow, a senior economist at Westdeutsche Landesbank
in Duesseldorf.

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The exhilaration of ending the governing party's
68-year reign in the lower house of Mexico's Congress was still
fresh as members of the new opposition majority got down to
business last September.
</P>
<P>
   But the celebration did not last long. When Santiago Creel
Miranda of the National Action Party assumed control of the
Committee on Government and Constitutional Issues, eager to start
research for several important reforms, he found that he had
inherited no records at all even though his committee handles
almost half of all legislation and has existed since 1824.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't a single file, not a single document of the past
legislature or those that came before,'' Creel said. ``I began with
nothing more than a pencil and a sheet of paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Other committees headed by the opposition got off to even worse
starts. The Foreign Relations Committee not only had no records, it
also had no office furniture or equipment save for one computer
with a broken monitor. The library of the Institute of Legislative
Research, the historical memory of the lower house, was empty
except for a set of the Encyclopaedia Britannica.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's strict term limits _ consecutive re-elections are
prohibited _ meant that nearly all the opposition members were
freshmen with no real experience in how the Congress worked. It was
no surprise to them that committees had been unimportant in past
congresses, but they never realized until the session started that
the enormous congressional building, the Palace of St. Lazarus, had
been built without committee meeting rooms.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, almost all bills originated in the president's
office and came to a committee chairman with the committee's
report, needed for the bill to be released for a vote, already
attached.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the opposition-led committees in the new Congress did
meet, even if it meant doing so in the cafeteria. For the first
time, full sessions of Congress were broadcast on television.
Impeachment proceedings were begun against two governing party
governors accused of election violations.
</P>
<P>
   And despite predictions _ primarily from the governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party, the PRI _ that an opposition
majority would lead to gridlock, the new congress passed 34
initiatives into law.
</P>
<P>
   Among them were a strong domestic violence law that challenges
Mexico's macho traditions and protects women against their
husbands, a law coordinating civil defense and important
refinements to a law recognizing dual nationality.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, the session set Mexico's formerly discredited
Congress on a new democratic path, one in which presidential
initiatives are no longer blindly passed, where debate is vigorous
and where the art of compromise is being refined.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name of the congressional building, San Lazarus, is very
appropriate,'' said Creel. ``In the scriptures, Lazarus died but
was brought back to life. The elections of last year performed a
similar miracle. Saint Lazarus has been revived and all the noise,
all the disharmony, that you see and hear in this Congress is that
new life.''
</P>
<P>
   The transformation has not been completed by any means. During
the first year, the opposition made plenty of procedural mistakes.
And because some members found it hard to give up the outrageous
antics they relied on during the years they were powerless before
the governing party's unquestioned majority, many sessions were
interrupted by fistfights and shouting matches.
</P>
<P>
   With the governing party still in control of the Senate, laws
passed by the lower house could be blocked, as happened with the
cut in the value-added tax that many opposition candidates had
promised during their campaigns. Concerns have been raised about
the new Congress' output, and about the strict party discipline
that keeps even opposition members from voting independently.
</P>
<P>
   A new session begins Sept. 1, with a full agenda of unresolved
issues, the most troubling of which is what to do about a $62
billion bank bailout that the administration of President Ernesto
Zedillo wants to convert into public debt. The issue has split the
opposition into stubborn camps, and threatens the unity of the
governing party itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some segments of public opinion could see this as paralysis,''
said Arturo Nunez Jimenez, leader of the party caucus. ``But we are
still working on it.''
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the way the Mexican Congress works is similar to the
functioning of the U.S. Congress. But Jeffrey Weldon, an American
political scientist at the Autonomous Technological Institute of
Mexico who is an expert on the Mexican Congress, said the lower
house, called the Chamber of Deputies, is shackled by outdated
rules and fundamental ideological restraints based in large part on
an assumption that the governing party would always be in the
majority.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the rules of the chamber simply failed to address
the question of filling leadership positions when no single party
has an absolute majority of the 500 seats, as happened after last
summer's elections.
</P>
<P>
   The governing party has 238 seats in the chamber. The leftist
Party of the Democratic Revolution, with the next highest total,
has 126. The National Action Party controls 120, two small parties
share a total of 13, and there are three independents.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Congress was sworn in, the four opposition
parties formed a united bloc and demanded leadership positions. The
best that could be worked out was a system of rotating speakerships
that gives every party a chance to lead the chamber, but does not
provide real leadership.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The work of the chamber during the last session was hampered by
archaic debate rules that allowed formal pronouncements to drag on
for hours. Work was delayed even further by old-fashioned voting
procedures in which even simple issues, like foreign service
appointments, required a roll call of all 500 deputies, a process
that could take up to two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Workers are now installing an electronic voting system that is
supposed to be in place for the opening of the new session Sept. 1.
A vote will take less than 3 minutes, and a permanent vote record _
up till now not available _ will be immediately made public.
</P>
<P>
   The legislative palace, named St. Lazarus because it was built
in the late 1970s on the site of the former St. Lazarus railroad
station, has imposing dimensions and imperial grandeur. But that
has not changed the low public regard for Congress, which is often
seen as nothing but a ``Greek chorus'' behind the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they do is sit around talking,'' said Jose Luis Castro, a
retired cook. Juan Laguna, a municipal worker in Mexico City, said,
``I don't think they do much, because every day we see the news and
there is one deputy punching another.''
</P>
<P>
   But some Mexicans are hopeful that things will change. ``For the
first time we have deputies who answer to us and who won't let the
PRI play dirty,'' said Pablo Gonzalez Torres, a restaurant manager.
</P>
<P>
   During the years the governing party controlled the chamber,
presidential bills were routinely approved by the party's
majorities, and almost always rejected by the opposition. Even
significant constitutional changes breezed through the Congress in
less than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Committees used to be little more than a list of names,'' said
Bernardo Batiz Vazquez, who is in his fourth nonconsecutive term as
an opposition member of the lower house. Mexican law prohibits
consecutive terms, but allows a deputy to return to the chamber for
nonconsecutive, three-year terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way it worked until recently was that bills came to the
committees from the president's office with the committee reports
clipped to the back,'' Batiz said. ``The committees never actually
met.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 34 bills passed into law during the first session, about
half were presidential initiatives, surprising given the antagonism
between the administration and the newly powerful opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Weldon said the role of the president and his relationship to
the governing party was still being resolved. ``The PRI is in the
process of deciding if it is the president's party or just the
PRI,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Nunez suggested that the president's role was clear. ``As in
other countries, but even more so in Mexico, the president is the
No. 1 legislator,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back over the last year, Weldon said it was obvious that
the part-time chamber needed to spend more time in session if its
work was to be taken seriously. The first period runs from Sept. 1
to Dec. 15, with sessions once or twice a week. The second lasts
only six weeks and is so brief that dozens of unfinished bills pile
up and have to be held over to the following September.
</P>
<P>
   He also said laws prohibiting re-election made seniority or
voter accountability impossible and should be changed. Overly rigid
party discipline means the chamber is essentially run by the
leaders of the five parties, and real independence from individual
deputies is rare.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, he said, opposition members need to be more
sophisticated about the horse-trading that is commonplace in
democratic legislatures if they want to insure their objectives are
met.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, they made a bunch of rookie mistakes but they also
have shown some autonomy,'' he said. ``What they have to learn is
how to package things to get what they want.''

VOTE SUNDAY IN PANAMA COULD AFFECT CANAL'S FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By LARRY ROHTER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA _ Officially, only the destiny of President Ernesto Perez
Balladares will be decided when people vote Sunday on a proposal
that would amend the Constitution here and allow him to seek a
second consecutive term. But the future of the Panama Canal may
also be at stake, and so the campaign here has turned
extraordinarily ferocious.
</P>
<P>
   If voters grant Perez Balladares, once part of the inner circle
of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, permission to run again, his next
objective would be to win the presidential election scheduled for
May. That would guarantee him another five years in office and give
him full sway over the canal when the United States yields control
of the waterway and the remaining military bases around it on Dec.
31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the vote has engaged the passions of Panamanians
more than any matter since the American invasion in 1989 that
overthrew General Noriega.
</P>
<P>
   Gerardo Gonzalez, president of both the governing party and the
Congress, has compared advocates of the ``no'' position to
``cockroaches and scorpions.'' Opponents of Perez Balladares, whose
nickname is El Toro, have portrayed him variously as Pinocchio and
a dead bull hanging from a meat hook.
</P>
<P>
   Perez Balladares said this week that he was ``not animated by
any personal ambition other than that of completing a task
undertaken that is already beginning to show results.''
</P>
<P>
   His goals in a second term, he added, would be to ``reduce
poverty, relieve unemployment and create the conditions that will
permit all Panamanians to assume united responsibility for the
efficient administration of the canal'' when the United States
hands it over.
</P>
<P>
   But it is precisely the prospect of seeing the canal in the
hands of Perez Balladares and his Democratic Revolutionary Party
that alarms the opposition here. They worry that a crude power grab
is already under way, and fear that its ratification would reduce
international confidence in Panama's ability to run the canal,
which is the backbone of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Given the opportunity last year to name directors to the Panama
Canal Authority, which will oversee the canal's administration
beginning in 2000, Perez Balladares appointed relatives, business
partners and party loyalists instead of the broad-based nonpartisan
board he had promised. There have also been suggestions by his
supporters that some canal functions could be ``privatized'' after
the waterway passes to Panamanian hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this moment, nothing is more important than the
administration of the Panama Canal,'' Joaquin Vallarino, one of the
country's most influential businessmen and a leader of the ``no''
movement, said in an interview here. ``Without a new government,
once the Americans leave, he can continue with what he already has:
total and absolute control of the board of directors and the
operations of the canal.''
</P>
<P>
   The principle that a sitting president not be allowed to succeed
himself has been embedded in law here since Theodore Roosevelt
engineered the country's separation from Colombia nearly a century
ago in order to build the Panama Canal. The country's current
Constitution, which went into effect in 1972, permits a president
to run for a second term, but only after he has been out of office
for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Perez Balladares, who was elected in 1994 despite winning barely
a third of the vote, has urged voters to consider only the
constitutional issues involved and not to make the referendum a
judgment on his performance in office. ``If you are unhappy with my
government, the time to hand me the bill is in 1999, not now,'' he
said this week.
</P>
<P>
   Some opposition to his plan has emerged even within the
governing party, led by potential candidates who would see their
own aspirations for the presidency delayed for five years or more
if Perez Balladares is given a chance to run again. But much of the
party rank and file appears solidly behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ours is the party that signed the treaty with Carter that
recovered our sovereignty, so we deserve to be the ones who receive
the canal,'' said Vicente Palacios, 41, a painter. ``It's the same
as if you're watching a good program on television: you want to
keep it on, not change the channel.''
</P>
<P>
   The official American position is one of neutrality, but the
governing party's decision to hire James Carville, one of President
Clinton's closest political associates, as their main campaign
adviser has set off much speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Party leaders were not available to discuss the choice, but
opposition figures suggested that Perez Balladares was hoping to
convey the false impression that the Clinton administration
secretly favors a second term for him. &QL;

SAFETY BOARD FAULTS FAA IN PLANE CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Aviation experts often blame mechanical problems or
pilot error for crashes. Last week the National Transportation
Safety Board blamed regulatory error by the Federal Aviation
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The crash involved a turboprop commuter plane on approach to
Detroit in January 1997. The board said it happened because the FAA
did not promulgate and enforce adequate standards for design and
operation of the plane in icing conditions, and that through
bureaucratic foul-up, the FAA failed to carry out procedures to
reduce risks that were developed by the manufacturer, Embraer.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion echoes what NTSB officials have said in the last
few months about two other crashes: TWA 800, a Boeing 747 that
exploded near New York City two years ago, and USAir 427, a Boeing
737 that went out of control on approach to Pittsburgh four years
ago. In those cases, too, the NTSB's experts said that the FAA had
not done a good enough job in deciding when a plane is safe to fly.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a hardware problem or a flaw in training, a structural
flaw at the FAA would be very complicated to fix. NTSB Chairman
James Hall summarized the problem harshly in comments after a
meeting Thursday that lasted more than five hours. ``It reflects an
attitude, which is what I'm concerned about, that needs to
change,'' Hall said. The FAA's attitude, he said, was not
aggressive enough on safety questions.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA's on-the-record responses to the criticism of the
Detroit crash seem almost stoic. The agency distributed a
chronology of actions it has taken on icing, which was the
immediate cause of the crash, but many of those were irrelevant to
the Detroit crash. Its chief spokesman, Eliot Brenner, said only
that the FAA would consider the recommendations carefully and would
work to improve its processes.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB, which has a history of criticizing the FAA, did spare
the FAA Administrator Jane Garvey. She has been trying to improve
the situation, the NTSB chairman said. Ms. Garvey was said by aides
to be too busy to talk about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But inside the FAA, another view prevails about where safety
originates. It was expressed in an interview Friday by Anthony
Broderick, the highest-ranking airplane safety official at the FAA
from 1986 until January 1997, when he left as a result of the
Valujet crash. That view is that the most the FAA can do, by law,
is set minimum standards, and that by law, the airlines are
supposed to operate with the highest possible levels of safety.
</P>
<P>
   Senior officials of the FAA often point to Broderick, now an
aviation consultant and thus free of the politics of government
service, as well qualified to lay out a regulator's perspective. He
said in a telephone interview that the airline in the Detroit
crash, Comair, had known of the procedures set up by Embraer to
reduce the risk of icing, but had not followed them. Thus, he said,
there is no question that Embraer did not follow the highest
possible level of safety.
</P>
<P>
   And as for not having proper standards for determining when a
plane is safe to fly, Broderick said that the FAA issues about 400
orders every year for changes in airliners. ``You can point to that
and say, every one of those is an FAA foul-up,'' Broderick said.
``You can also say that the FAA, like the people who design Airbus,
Boeing or Douglas planes, are humans and not perfect, that they
learn from experience in service, that they perfect the design,
that they never get to the perfect design.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the safety board can persuade the FAA that it should
follow a higher standard is not clear. ``The bottom line in
responsibility for safety in our country is a government
regulator,'' Hall said. ``The government regulator is the one we
pay our taxes to.''
</P>
<P>
   And the public is not getting its money's worth, Hall said,
because the system is breaking down. Board investigators discovered
in their inquiry into the Detroit crash that it followed at least
six loss-of-control events in other planes of the same model, the
EMB-120, and there has been at least one more since the crash. The
crew that died in the crash had not been adequately informed of
Embraer's new procedure, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Hall said, is to ``get the technology we've already
paid for into operation.''

<P>
   AYODHYA, India _ The pilgrims stand silently by the hour,
watching artisans chisel giant sandstone pillars for a magnificent
temple to Ram, the ideal manly incarnation of the Hindu god Vishnu.
Only the screeches of wild pink-faced monkeys scampering through
the open-air sheds break the soggy stillness.
</P>
<P>
   The workshop here, and three others in the state of Rajasthan,
are singly and relentlessly devoted to the construction of a
prefabricated temple to Ram on the site that many Hindus believe
was his birthplace _ and that was the scene of one of the greatest
traumas to independent India's secular fabric.
</P>
<P>
   It was here, a little over a mile from the workshop, that a mob
of Hindu militants stormed a 16th-century mosque on Dec. 6, 1992,
and demolished it in a few hours with sledgehammers, crowbars and
their bare hands. The act of destruction set off rioting across the
nation between Muslims and Hindus that left more than 1,000 dead,
most of them Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   The crusade for a temple to Ram here in Ayodhya on the very
place where the mosque once stood has been central to the political
ascendancy of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which
now leads the Indian government. And it has posed one of the
gravest challenges ever to modern India's 50-year tradition as a
secular nation committed to treating people of all faiths justly.
</P>
<P>
   As they campaigned in national elections this year, leaders of
the Bharatiya Janata Party promised they would seek to clear the
way for the temple's construction. The party's manifesto called
efforts to build the temple ``the greatest mass movement in
post-independence history,'' and said they had ``strengthened the
foundation of cultural nationalism.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the party came to power in March at the head of a
coalition government, construction of the temple to Ram was dropped
from the official agenda at the insistence of the party's coalition
partners. The new prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee of the
Bharatiya Jamata Party, pledged in June that the temple would be
built only if the courts gave the go-ahead or the nation's laws
were changed to allow it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the issue festers, and it could explode again into
violence. For centuries, India was dominated by Muslim invaders
known as the Moguls, and religious hatreds have periodically flared
ever since. In 1947, when British-ruled India was divided into
predominantly Muslim Pakistan and predominantly Hindu India,
hundreds of thousands were killed in the vast migration of Hindus
to India and Muslims to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Among Muslims and Hindus who abhorred the destruction of the
Babri Mosque here, which was built during the reign of the first
Mogul emperor, Babur, distrust of the Bharatiya Janata Party runs
deep. After all, they say, three of the party's leaders, who are
now Cabinet ministers, face criminal charges of complicity in the
illegal destruction of the mosque in cases that are still pending.
Why should the party's promise to abide by the law be believed now,
they ask. They fear that the prefabricatedtemple will suddenly be
erected by militants, once again tearing the country apart.
</P>
<P>
   Among the core supporters of the Bharatiya Janata Party the
worry is a different one. Those who have pressed doggedly for the
temple are disappointed that the party has not taken bold action on
it since it came to power. They have begun publicly pressing the
party's leaders to deliver on their election commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, a group that has been
closely allied with the Bharatiya Janata Party and that has been at
the forefront of the temple cause, spoke out recently in The Times
of India, criticizing the party for failing to take steps to win
quicker court approval for the temple construction.
</P>
<P>
   They say they rejoiced when the mosque was ``liberated'' in 1992
and plan to lay the temple's foundation in 2001. And they insist
that the temple must be built where the mosque once was because the
site is not only Ram's birthplace, but also where an ancient Hindu
temple stood that was razed by Babur, a contention much disputed by
historians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The birthplace of Lord Ram cannot be changed,'' said Giriraj
Kishore, the secretary general of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad. ``Can
you change the birthplace of Christ? Can you?''
</P>
<P>
   By order of India's Supreme Court, the site is under heavy
security, surrounded by barbed wire and armed guards posted in
watchtowers and along the perimeter. The court has decreed that
there be no construction until a tangle of related court cases are
resolved, a process that could take years.

   On a recent afternoon, a trickle of pilgrims _ bent-over old men
leaning on wooden staffs and gaggles of relatives _ walked through
the metal detector at the entry to the site and lifted their arms
to be patted down for weapons. They then threaded their way along a
narrow corkscrew path, enclosed by a 10-foot-high fence of metal
bars, to a makeshift temple to Ram that was hurriedly raised on the
rubble of the mosque soon after its destruction.
</P>
<P>
   There, the pilgrims reached through the bars to leave offerings
of coins, sweets and flower petals. As they emerged from the site,
a swarm of hawkers offered crude pamphlets for 10 rupees, about a
quarter, with gory photographs from December 1992 of bloodied kar
sewaks, the Hindu volunteers whose rampage brought down the mosque.
</P>
<P>
   In Ayodhya, a matched pair of leaders _ one Hindu, one Muslim _
are keeping the flame of agitation alive through the sultry monsoon
season. The bare-chested Hindu monk who heads the Ram Birthplace
Temple Trust, Ram Chandra Das, was playing cards with his disciples
in the courtyard of his small temple and hurriedly put them away
when visitors arrived. He primped his long, matted hair for a
camera.
</P>
<P>
   He sat cross-legged on a raised platform, and his words grew
more fiery the longer he spoke. His finger jabbing the air and his
yellowish, ragged beard shaking with fervor, the monk, who says he
is 90, defiantly declared that the temple would be built whether
the courts permitted it or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a judgment against God and spirituality, I will
not accept it,'' he said. ``The court cannot decide whether Lord
Ram was born here or not. This will be decided by our religion and
our religious people.''
</P>
<P>
   In a humble house across town, another old man, a gaunt, retired
tailor named Mohammad Hasim Ansari, speaks for the Muslims of
Ayodhya who want the mosque, known as the Babri Masjid, rebuilt.
Ansari, 78, who is chairman of the Babri Masjid Reconstruction
Committee, is still bitter about what happened the day the mosque,
Ayodhya's oldest, was torn down.
</P>
<P>
   As a herd of fat black water buffalo rolled in the mud outside
his door, Ansari recalled how his family had run away while much of
his home was destroyed by Hindus who attacked Muslim homes and
places of worship after destroying the mosque.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't trust the political leaders now,'' he said. ``None of
them came forward to help us.''
</P>
<P>
   But his milky eyes glinted with mischief when he talked about
his Hindu counterpart, Das. The men have known each other for half
a century. Here in this sacred town, where Mogul lords once gave
land grants for the building of Hindu temples, where Hindus and
Muslims lived side by side in peace for centuries, where Muslim
tailors have richly embroidered the finery of Hindu icons, Ansari
mildly called Das ``a nice man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I wasn't here, no one would ask for him,'' Ansari said
wryly. ``And if he wasn't there, nobody would come to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The mundane quality of small-town life was equally palpable at
the workshop here where 40 men are at work carving intricate
designs and the images of Hindu deities into pillars for the
temple. The artisans, far from being inspired by the sacredness of
their task, complained about their wages, which one worker,
Janardhan Sharma, 40, put at a little over $2 a day.
</P>
<P>
   For the pilgrims, too, the material world exists in the same
breath with the spiritual. Ram Kumari, 60, the wife of a tea stall
owner, had come by train from her home in the state of Bihar to pay
her respects to Ram.
</P>
<P>
   A devout Hindu, she said she had voted for the Bharatiya Janata
Party this year, but would not the next time. ``Prices are high,''
said Mrs. Kumari, a housewife with a family to feed. ``Onions are
20 rupees per kilo.''

   ATTN: Mon, Aug. 31, is the one-year anniversary of the tragic

</P>
<P>
   DIANA-ANNIVERSARY _ LONDON _ A year after her tragic death in an
automobile accident in Paris, Princess Diana remains ``the people's
princess.'' She has come to represent an ideal of ordinary decency
to average English people, who consider her an icon they can relate
to. What's more, she has become an international symbol for people
around the world of charity, and class. A year later, it appears
her presence is a strong as ever as stories about her are in the
news weekly, and millions of dollars is given (and taken) in her
name daily. (Roughton, Cox News Service).

mother's features, he may actually be the first choice among the
British populace to ascend to the throne when his grandmother,
Queen Elizabeth passes away -- ahead of his well-known father,
Prince Charles, and uncle, Prince Andrew. (Roughton, Cox News
Service).

   DIANA-INVESTIGATION _ LONDON _ The automobile accident that
caused Princess Di's death has spawned numerous investigations, and

commemorate the first anniversary of the death of Diana, Princess
of Wales. A ceremony will be held at 12:26 a.m. (local time) today,
to mark the moment when Dianas limousine hit the 13th pillar of an
underpass on a right bank expressway. Her companion, Dodi Fayed,
and the driver, Henri Paul, also died. The ceremony is being
organized by a private association, Paris Odysee, after the royal
family informed the British embassy and Paris city council that
expressions of grief should be limited to personal reflection.

   DIANA _ Monday is the first anniversary of Princess Diana's
birthday in eternity. That's a pious phrase long used by Christian
faithful to describe the day a saint died. For millions of her
fans, Diana, the Princess of Wales, remains a kind of secular
saint. She personifies, for them, all that is good and gracious in
a world of struggle and pain. To be sure, Diana struggled much,
knew great pain and was, in many ways, a good and gracious person.
But she is not likely to be a saint. The remarkable relationship
between the troubled princess and her adoring public is more
complicated. (Gushee, Palm Beach Post). 21.

   GLENN _ John Glenn's historic return to space is now just two
months away but knowlegeable observers remain unimpressed with the
science of the flight, even as they pledge support for it on
thematic grounds. But that's what NASA had in mind anyway. NASA
Administrator Dan Goldin spoke frankly in an interview with us
earlier this summer about how he insisted the science be
legitimate, but how he never intended for it to be the sole
justification for Glenn's return to space. ``I wasn't asking the
National Institutes of Health to say, 'I want you to fly John
Glenn.' But I said, 'Given that John Glenn is flying I want you to
tell me that he's doing good science.''' (Montgomery, Dayton Daily

   FLU-RISK _ Eighty years ago, the Spanish Flu virus killed 40
million people and then disappeared. Scientists trying to pry its
secrets out of an Arctic cemetery are taking no chances that they
might bring it back to life. The four-nation team believes that
frozen remnants of the virus are in the bodies of seven victims
that were buried in permafrost in the island outpost of
Longyearbyen, north of the Norwegian mainland. The chance that the
1918 virus hidden in the bodies remains infectious is ``very small
- but it is not zero,'' according to Peter Lewin, a pediatrician
who was asked to join the team becuase of his hobby: medical
archaeology, which included recovering smallpox virus fragments
from an Egyptian mummy. The team hopes for the best but is assuming
the worst: Pathologists will wear protective gear compatible with
arctic clothing, and the tent around the excavation will be the
portable equivalent of the most secure lab at CDC. (McKenna,

   JAMAICA-BROTHELS _ KINGSTON, JAMAICA _ A fervent call has come
in Jamaica to legalize brothels by none other than ... the
president of the Chamber of Commerce? ``We could be like
Amsterdam,'' said Howard Hamilton. Tourism provides jobs for more
than 40 percent of the island's population. But tourists aren't
flocking to Jamaica like they once did because of harassment, the
worst in the Caribbean. In the midst of an economic depression,
tourists find themselves bombarded by desperate panhandlers,
prostitutes, drug dealers and craft vendors, so much so that
Holland America and Celebrity Cruise Lines pulled out of Jamaica
last year. Jamaica has increased fines for those who badger
tourists, from $27 to $2,700. But still the harassment continues.
Hamilton said that if the country legalized brothels, at least the
prostitutes would stay off the streets -- he hopes. (Emling, Cox

   BELARUS-PUPPET _ MINSK, Belarus _ The Soviet Union has collapsed
and the Moscow nights swing nowadays, but back here in Minsk old
communist-style think still remains the norm. Take the case of
``Pinocchio.'' The Belarussian version of the traditional puppet
show for children was yanked off the Minsk stage not long ago when
critics saw too many allusions to the current nasty political scene
in the play. How could a mere children's show cause so much offense
in this dictator-run land? That's easy. To begin with, Ales Surau,
the set designer, dressed the wooden ``actors'' in contemporary
quilted jackets, Russian workers' caps, and workers' rubber boots.
That act alone aroused the ire of the official critics. ``The
peasants look like criminals. I was at a collective farm not long
ago and I saw people there who were very well dressed,'' one them
complained. (Golinski, Cox News Service).

   MEXICO-DEAFMUTE _ MEXICO CITY _ He sold trinkets in the New York
subway, Chicago and the suburban American South. But by the time he
was discovered by U.S. authorities, life had changed for Braulio
David Infante. He knew that deaf people in the United States had
high schools, colleges and could develop professions. He was smart
and ambitious why couldn't he? Infante, who just turned 20, was
among the many undocumented Mexican deaf mutes discovered in the
United States last year, some held in virtual captivity and forced
to turn over trinket profits to ring leaders. Infante was sent back
from Atlanta to Mexico, where authorities promised to help him and
others with new opportunities to overcome barriers in Mexico.
Almost a year later, he says, nothing has changed. The Mexican
government recently made similar promises to deaf mutes who
returned from New York in July. But Infante says social workers
here have treated him as if he were mentally retarded. Clever and
resourceful, he longs to break out of the silence that isolates
him. He wants to attend college and become a Mexican-American Sign
Language interpreter. But in Mexico there isn't even a high school
for him to attend. Infante remains in contact with his Atlanta
lawyer, and dreams of one day attending school in the United
States. (Ferriss, Cox News Service).

THE U.S. OPEN: EASIER TO BE THE HUNTER THAN THE HUNTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bigger is better at the $14 million U.S. Open: big
noise, big money and, as Venus Williams and Irina Spirlea showed in
last year's demolition derby of a semifinal, big collisions.
</P>
<P>
   This year, with Pete Sampras' No. 1 ranking being stalked by a
handful of heavy hitters, and with a half-dozen contestants having
already reminded the defending champion, Martina Hingis, how to
lose in 1998, the collisions figure to be plentiful as well as
costly when the tournament starts Monday at the USTA National
Tennis Center. The finals will be Sept. 11 and 12.
</P>
<P>
   The Open prides itself on being the Grand Slam event where the
two players best able to turn themselves into human pit bulls for
two weeks can walk away with great big his-and-her checks for
$700,000 for a seven-round workout. It is a record payout at the
only Grand Slam event that puts a positive spin on gender equity
from top to bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Players, remove your muzzles and enter the fray. And earplugs
are definitely not permitted. This is, after all, a full-contact
event where the senses are, Sampras said, under full assault by
everything from the aroma of barbecue wafting from the midway to
the brazen corporate signs lining Arthur Ashe Stadium to the
clatter and chatter of a New York crowd that, after years of
inciting from maestros like Jimmy Connors, considers the Open an
audience participation sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Open is probably the loudest tournament in terms of
everything,'' Monica Seles, a two-time champion and four-time
finalist, said of the decibel level at the only event where her
signature grunt blends seamlessly with the urban cacophony of
roaring aircraft, shrill cellular phones and the hum of the El.
``You've got to be totally focused on what your task is when you're
there; it takes a lot out of you. It's totally different, and no
matter what you've done up until then, everything starts brand new
when you get there.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Open is also the last hurrah on the 1998 Grand Slam
calendar, and because the three earlier events produced three
different champions in both the men's and the women's domains, the
Open represents the final chance for somebody to take charge of
their sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time a Grand Slam comes around, you get a certain buzz, a
certain knot in your stomach,'' said the top-seeded Sampras. ``And
the Open, well, it's our Super Bowl. And this year, anything can
happen; there's no team that's the obvious favorite. You've got
Agassi, Rafter, Krajicek, Ivanisevic. And me.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Sampras, he does not have quite the same aplomb
heading off to Flushing Meadows to try for a fifth Open title as he
had when he carried out an identical mission earlier this year at
Wimbledon. ``I went into Wimbledon a four-star guy; I'm kind of a
two-star guy at the Open,'' said Sampras, who figures there are
``probably eight guys who can logically win here.''
</P>
<P>
   Alone among them, Sampras is trying to make history at the event
he calls the ``most modern'' of the Grand Slam quartet. With a
victory, he will tie Roy Emerson with an even dozen Grand Slam
titles, the most among men. The rest are not worried about records;
they're just trying to survive for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Open, and who knows,'' said Goran Ivanisevic, the
runner-up to Sampras last month at Wimbledon. ``I can win the whole
thing or I can lose first round. With me, with the Open, everything
is a risk; but probably I was born risky.''
</P>
<P>
   But winning the Open is a risky proposition. It is like
negotiating a maze that is ever rearranging itself, with the added
complications of volatile weather and in-your-face fans. The
tournament brings out the inner kamikaze artist and makes a meal of
the inner wimp.
</P>
<P>
   The Open's appropriately rakish defending champions, the
omnipresent Hingis and the acrobatic Patrick Rafter, cannot count
on special treatment here: the Open does not play favorites on the
basis of incumbency. Or on familiarity. Novelty gets big points.
That is how Williams, who had never been to any final before making
the breakthrough that produced last year's all-teen-age finale with
Hingis, and Rafter, who practically became a folk hero after
capturing his only Grand Slam event, took control of the marquee in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Both Rafter and Williams admitted being ``on automatic pilot''
during last year's campaign. In a place where you can't hear
yourself think, they wisely did not try to. Instead, they let
instinct and ambition take them where they wanted to go. This year,
they face a new ingredient: the pressure to repeat. ``I'm going out
there to defend a lot, and if I don't, I'll be out of the race
pretty quickly,'' Rafter said.
</P>
<P>
   On the women's side, Hingis and Williams will again carry the
banner for the teen-age contingent, but the geriatric generation
has staged a mighty comeback in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   That group features Jana Novotna, 29, who finally put herself on
the Grand Slam victory map at Wimbledon; Arantxa Sanchez Vicario,
26, who broke a four-year Grand Slam drought when she claimed the
French Open title; Steffi Graf, 29, who missed last year's event
because of knee surgery and craves restitution, and Seles, who
tamed Hingis en route to her Canadian Open title.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the freshly formidable Lindsay Davenport, who put
on the only display of summertime invincibility by any player _
male or female _ by seizing three consecutive hardcourts titles in
California, her home state.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport, seeded second, thinks this Open is literally open.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's one of the more interesting Slams in a long
time,'' she said. ``When you have an equalizing surface like this,
there's seven or eight players who can definitely win it, and you
haven't had that lately in women's tennis. There's probably six of
us at almost even odds because you can't say Hingis is the
overwhelming favorite like she was last year, when you had one
clearly dominant player.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Hingis, just 17 but so preternaturally acquisitive
that she treated every Grand Slam event as if it might be her last,
monopolized the women's circuit by taking home three out of four
Grand Slam titles, including this one.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, she has come up empty-handed since defending her title
at the Australian Open. At the French Open, Seles doused her with
powerball in the semifinals, and at Wimbledon, Novotna dethroned
her in another semifinal. But that does not guarantee Hingis'
demise at Flushing Meadows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see her as being discouraged, because she doesn't like it
when other people win the big tournaments,'' Davenport said. ``I
have no doubt she's going to be back and be ready and be tougher.
She's done it before, and she knows what she's doing out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I ended up playing her at the Open, I certainly wouldn't go
into the match thinking she's vulnerable; I'd go into it thinking
she's No. 1,'' said Davenport, who is just one rung behind Hingis
on the computer ranking.
</P>
<P>
   Said Hingis: ``The game has gotten very interesting: you don't
have that same winner at every tournament. I probably haven't been
winning as everyone expected me to do. It's easier to be the hunter
than the hunted one; but that's the life. That's the game.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the 1998 Open. &QL;

TOXINS FOUND IN WHALE LIVER RAISE WARNING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MARLISE SIMONS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands _ Dutch scientists say they have
discovered toxic industrial chemicals in the tissue of whales that
normally feed in deep waters of the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   While the quantities detected may not be harmful to the huge
mammals, the scientists say their findings, presented at a
conference in Stockholm last week, should serve as a warning of how
far the chemicals have penetrated the ocean's food chain. Some
findings also were reported in Nature magazine in July.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are so-called polybrominated compounds that are used as
flame retardants in many everyday products, like television-set
casings and children's clothing.
</P>
<P>
   While these chemicals can be useful to consumers, they appear to
be resilient and harmful in nature. Scientists say they behave much
like PCBs and DDT, which were banned for their toxicity.
</P>
<P>
   Now the scientists say they have evidence that the brominated
compounds enter the atmosphere and river and sea water, probably
because they are not fully destroyed in waste incinerators. The
molecules do not dissolve easily in water and eventually find their
way into animal and perhaps human tissue, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The study showed that we are seeing warning signals that more
serious problems may be ahead,'' said Jacob de Boer, of the
Netherlands Institute for Fisheries Research, who led the team that
analyzed the whale tissue. ``These compounds are useful and
relatively cheap, and industry has not been motivated to look for
alternatives. But maybe that time has come.''
</P>
<P>
   For their most recent study, de Boer and a team of 10 Dutch
scientists examined 13 sea mammals, including sperm and minke
whales that were stranded on the Dutch coast in 1996 and 1997. They
said they found traces of the compounds in the animals' fat and
sometimes in the liver.
</P>
<P>
   Significant levels of the compounds had already been found in
sea creatures that live near the coast, like dolphins and seals,
but finding them in minke and sperm whales is more disturbing, de
Boer said, because these whales normally feed at a depth of about
1,000 to 3,600 feet and the males hunt as far north as Iceland,
where the ocean is presumed to be clean. &QL;

PROSPECT OF STARR REPORT CONSUMES WASHINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the two weeks since President Clinton
acknowledged having had an inappropriate relationship with Monica
Lewinsky, the capital's attention has been riveted by the prospect
of an impeachment report that official Washington assumes
independent counsel Kenneth Starr will send to the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   On the Sunday talk shows and over lunches at this city's
downtown restaurants, Washingtonians debate what will be, or what
they think should be, in Starr's report. They trade guesses over
how quickly the report could be completed and how much of it should
be made public.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Starr has not even said that his prosecutors are
writing a report. Nor does it seem to matter to most
prognosticators that there has been no direct contact between
Starr's office and the House Judiciary Committee, which would
receive the document and decide whether impeachment proceedings
against Clinton were warranted.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as what the report is going to look like, I haven't the
faintest idea,'' David Schippers, chief investigative counsel of
the House Judiciary Committee, said in an interview on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Schippers and most everyone else on Capitol Hill
are convinced that Starr has indeed reached the most important
challenge of his four-year-old inquiry: rendering a judgment of the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Several lawyers who say they are familiar with Starr's plans say
prosecutors are preparing to forward a lengthy report to the House
that will include ``substantial and credible information'' of
offenses that could constitute grounds for the impeachment of
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Expected to be completed sometime in September, the report will
almost certainly say the president lied under oath when he denied
in January that he had a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton admitted to Starr's grand jury and to the nation on Aug.
17 that he had had a relationship with the former White House
intern that was ``not appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers also added that it is unlikely the report will be
confined to the accusation that the president committed perjury in
making the denial in the sexual misconduct lawsuit that was filed
against him by Paula Jones, and which was later dismissed by a
federal judge.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, prosecutors have also discussed the possibility
of accusing Clinton of lying to the grand jury when he testified
that the ``intimate physical contacts'' he had with Ms. Lewinsky
did not meet the definition of ``sexual relations'' established in
the Jones lawsuit, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are also writing draft sections that would accuse
Clinton of obstruction of justice and encouraging others to lie
under oath, or suborning perjury, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   In a phrase that harkens back to an article of impeachment filed
against Richard Nixon, prosecutors are said to be considering an
accusation that Clinton abused the power of his office when he used
White House lawyers and claims of various privileges to attempt to
delay and thwart the prosecutors' inquiry, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the report, lawyers said, prosecutors are also likely to
forward copies of transcripts of testimony from the 75 witnesses
who have appeared before the grand jury here; 20 hours of
audiotapes made by Linda Tripp, Ms. Lewinsky's former colleague who
recorded their conversations; records of Ms. Lewinsky's visits to
the White House; telephone calls between the president and Ms.
Lewinsky; the president's videotaped grand jury testimony and other
physical evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The authors of the report are saying nothing. Charles Bakaly, a
spokesman for Starr, declined to comment last week. He declined to
even confirm that prosecutors were producing a report.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Rotunda, a University of Illinois law professor who is an
adviser to Starr on constitutional law, also declined to confirm
that a report is under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can be assured that everything is being done with the
utmost carefulness,'' Rotunda said. ``We leave no stone unturned.
The great bulk of people in this office are career Justice
Department lawyers who are very careful lawyers. This is serious
business.''
</P>
<P>
   And those who would receive a report, members of the House
Judiciary Committee, would say only that they assume Starr's report
will land on their doorstep relatively soon.
</P>
<P>
   Even that is just a hunch, the committee's members and lawyers
said, adding that they have not spoken a single time with Starr or
his prosecutors. Like everyone else, staff workers on the committee
as well as its members, including Rep. Henry J. Hyde, R-Ill., the
chairman, can only venture guesses about a report's contents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hearing it's going to be a pretty substantial amount of
material,'' said Schippers, the 62-year-old Chicago lawyer who is
the committee's chief investigative counsel. ``I assume it will be
a very complete report and it would contain not only good but bad _
not only evidence but evidence tending to cast doubt on that
evidence.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   If history is a guide, Starr's report would bear out Schippers'
assertion. In October 1997, Starr's office filed a 114-page report
on the death of Vincent Foster, a close friend of the Clintons, in
which it ruled that Foster had committed suicide. In 1992, another
independent counsel, Lawrence Walsh, filed a report on the sale of
weapons to Iran and diversion of profits to Nicaraguan rebels that
numbered nearly 1,000 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Schippers said he and the minority counsel, Abbe Lowell, planned
to first review the report for credible and substantial evidence of
impeachable offenses, a term left unspecified in the Constitution.
They would then discuss their view of the evidence with committee
members. Schippers said his goal was to complete the review process
before the congressional recess in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point,'' he said, ``the committee would decide whether
to hold hearings or not.'' If hearings were ordered, they would not
be held before next year.
</P>
<P>
   Already, many prognostications have been proved wrong. For
example, several commentators had predicted in the spring that
Starr would file a report by May. Now, some are saying that he will
not file one until after the November elections. But most pundits
and allies of Starr say that they expect a report to be filed with
the House by late September.
</P>
<P>
   Accounts of the scope of the report have also varied. Several
news reports said that Starr would focus only on matters relating
to the Lewinsky investigation and leave out other inquiries: the
Clintons' Whitewater real estate dealings in Arkansas, their
possibly improper use of FBI personnel files and the dismissal of
aides from the White House travel office.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Olson, a Washington lawyer and outspoken defender of
Starr, said that she believed there might be a dispute within the
office over whether the report should focus solely on Ms. Lewinsky
or cover other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``In building an obstruction of justice case,'' Ms. Olson said,
``it seems to me that he must put in other evidence that fits the
pattern of obstruction that has nothing to do with Monica
Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the 20-year-old Independent Counsel Act, a special
prosecutor ``shall advise the House of Representatives of any
substantial and credible information that may constitute grounds
for impeachment.'' The law does not say precisely how an
independent counsel transmits such information to the House, which
gives Starr's prosecutors wide latitude.
</P>
<P>
   Several former prosecutors said that they assumed the report
would have the same makeup as a ``prosecutorial memo,'' which
outlines the reasons and evidence that support an indictment.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Schippers and other committee aides have told reporters
in recent days that they hoped Starr would submit an ``executive
summary.'' A summary could give an overview of the report without
divulging secret grand jury testimony. In that format, the
committee could then make that portion of the report public without
running afoul of rules that require grand jury testimony to be kept
secret.
</P>
<P>
   But Bakaly declined to say whether that advice would be
followed.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for Starr's report, some of Clinton's political
advisers have recommended that his lawyers write their own rebuttal
to accusations they expect would be made. White House aides say
that the prosecutors are biased against the president and will not
produce a balanced account of the facts. No decision has been made.
</P>
<P>
   If the House Judiciary Committee is satisfied with Starr's
evidence, the panel would vote on articles of impeachment, followed
by a full House debate and vote on impeachment. A simple majority
would be required to move the process to the Senate, where Chief
Justice William Rehnquist would preside over impeachment
proceedings, the equivalent of a trial.
</P>
<P>
   The votes of two thirds of the Senate _ 67 senators _ are
required to convict and remove a federal official. &QL;

 &HT;    CHERNOMYRDIN VOWS RUSSIA WILL NOT RETURN TO SOVIET PAST
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW In remarks aimed at calming concerns of the United States
and other Western powers, acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin
vowed Saturday that Russia would not revert to its Soviet past as
it struggles with a deepening economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But Chernomyrdin has yet to unveil detailed plans of how to pull
Russia from its financial and political mire one week after his
surprise reappointment by President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and other Western lenders fear that Yeltsin
and Chernomyrdin will impose Soviet-style measures such as price
controls and printing more rubles in an effort to ease the economic
chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have already joined the world economy, and there will be no
return to the past,'' Chernomyrdin said on national television.
</P>
<P>
   He also sought to alleviate the fears of ordinary Russians, who
have seen the value of the ruble plummet 50 percent against the
U.S. dollar in the past two weeks as consumer prices rise. Many
banks are on the brink of collapse, sending panicked Russians
rushing to try to remove their deposits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have taken the decision to guarantee people's savings in
full. The government and the central bank are working out a
mechanism to carry out this decision,'' Chernomyrdin said.
</P>
<P>
   He also pledged to keep the ruble convertible on Russian and
world markets and to crack down on the illegal export of Western
currencies.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, scheduled to meet Yeltsin in a summit Tuesday
and Wednesday in Moscow, has urged Russia to continue to pursue the
free-market reforms begun after the Soviet Union disintegrated in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman called Chernomyrdin's statement Saturday
``encouraging,'' adding, ``they are going to continue on the path
of economic reform.''
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund, which assembled a $22.6 billion
bailout plan for Russia in July, has warned that further
installments of the package would be withheld should Russia enact
rigid state economic controls.
</P>
<P>
   IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus, who held emergency talks
with Chernomyrdin on Wednesday in Ukraine, warned that such
policies ``would inevitably lead to command economy methods and
hyperinflation, with consequent dire social consequences. This
would lead to disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   The interim government led by Chernomyrdin had earlier indicated
it would support Soviet-style economic measures in talks with the
opposition parliament, led by the Communists.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin and his acting prime minister appeared to be taking the
offensive as negotiations continued Saturday over the economic
plans and a proposed power-sharing arrangement between the
government and the Communist-dominated Duma, the lower house of
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   But the opposition continued to insist on constitutional
amendments to give parliament more say over Cabinet appointments
and government policies in return for Duma confirmation of
Chernomyrdin as prime minister. The Duma is scheduled to begin the
confirmation debate on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian newspaper Izvestia warned Saturday that the policies
being considered would lead Russia from ``crisis to collapse'' and
demonstrates the weakness of the Yeltsin regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It proposes initiatives which can only be called suicidal,''
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   The daily Russky Telegraf said Saturday that Yeltsin had been
reduced to a figurehead. Haggling between Chernomyrdin and the Duma
had created a dangerous political vacuum, it said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Russia today there is no definite center of power _ the
president has retreated from affairs and only carries out symbolic
functions like meeting foreign visitors,'' the paper said.
</P>
<P>
   Under intense pressure to resign, Yeltsin went on national
television Friday to declare that he would serve out his
presidential term, which ends in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party and other opposition factions continued its
calls for Yeltsin to step down.
</P>
<P>
   The political and economic situation in the country will force
Yeltsin to resign,'' said Valentin Kuptsov, deputy leader of the
Communists.

OLEG PROKOFIEV, 69, EXPERT ON HIS FATHER'S MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ALLAN KOZINN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oleg Prokofiev, whose work as a painter and sculptor was often
overshadowed by his championship of the music of his composer
father, Sergei, died Aug. 20 while vacationing on the island of
Guernsey in the English Channel. He was 69 and lived in London.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was a heart attack, The Associated Press
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Prokofiev, the composer's second son, was born in 1928 while his
parents were living in self-imposed exile in Paris. His mother, who
was known as Lina (her full name was Carolina Codina y Llubera),
was born in Spain and grew up in the United States. She met the
composer after he played at New York's Carnegie Hall in 1918, and
returned to Europe with him.
</P>
<P>
   In 1935, the family returned to Moscow, where Sergei Prokofiev
was first celebrated and later persecuted by the Soviet
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, the couple became estranged, and Oleg and
his older brother, Sviatoslav, spent most of their time with their
mother in Moscow. As a foreigner, she was regarded as a security
risk, particularly since she continued to correspond with her
mother in Nazi-occupied Paris, and maintained contact with Western
friends, particularly Americans, despite her husband's warnings
that she be more cautious.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948 she was arrested, charged with espionage and sent to a
prison camp, where she remained until 1957, four years after the
composer's death.
</P>
<P>
   Oleg Prokofiev studied sculpture at the Moscow School of Art,
and privately with Robert Falk, but because he was attracted to
avant-garde techniques, his work was rarely exhibited in Moscow. In
1971, after the death of his second wife, Camilla Gray, an English
art historian, he and his daughter were allowed to visit his
in-laws in England. They did not return, and were later joined in
London by his mother.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, he was a fellow in the fine arts department at
Leeds University, and he continued to produce painting, sculpture
and poetry, although his artworks were most widely seen when they
were associated with festivals of his father's music.
</P>
<P>
   It was, in fact, as a lecturer and authority on his father's
music that Prokofiev was best known. In 1985, he joined his mother,
who was then 88, onstage at Alice Tully Hall for a performance of
``Peter and the Wolf'' with Lukas Foss and the Brooklyn
Philharmonic. He also narrated the work for a recording on the
Hyperion label in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   He was involved in the translation and editing of his father's
``Soviet Diary 1927 and Other Writings,'' and he corresponded
enthusiastically with musicians, musicologists and filmmakers who
were interested in works by his father and other Soviet composers.
He was also active in the establishment of the Prokofiev Archive at
Goldsmiths College, University of London.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Francis Child, and their four
children, as well as a son and a daughter from earlier marriages.
His mother, Lina, died in 1989 at age 91.

BOSOX FANS' DREAM: KNOCK OFF THE YANKEES  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that the Boston Red Sox are virtually certain to be in the
American League playoffs, let The Fantasy begin.
</P>
<P>
   In Phase I of The Fantasy, the Red Sox and the Yankees would win
their opening-round playoff series. In Phase II, the Red Sox would
beat the Yankees in the American League Championship Series. Would
there be a Phase III, a World Series championship? It might not
matter to Red Sox fans, because avenging 1978 could be enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a distinct fantasy of Red Sox fans everywhere,'' said Dan
Duquette, the team's general manager. ``It would be a dramatic
exclamation point. Red Sox fans everywhere would rejoice.''
</P>
<P>
   Just think. The Yankees finish the season with the most
victories in major league history, and they do not reach the World
Series because the wild-card Red Sox knock them off.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox have not secured their post-season spot, but they
have maintained a steady pace throughout the season and have held
off all challengers for the wild-card designation, including the
recent attempt by the Baltimore Orioles. Going into Saturday's
games, they are eight games ahead of the Texas Rangers and 10 ahead
of the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   They lost more than half of their lead over Baltimore in the six
weeks after the All-Star Game break, but the Orioles did not gain
because the Red Sox were playing poorly. The Orioles played so
torridly, winning 30 of 38 games, that it was going to be
impossible for them to maintain that pace. And indeed, they have
stopped their charge, losing eight of their last night games after
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, meanwhile, have the league's second-best record and
are in position to win 96 games, perhaps more. In their five
division-championship seasons, the Red Sox did not win more than 95
games. If they were to reach 96 this season, it would be their
highest victory total since they reached 99 in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   If only they had gained No. 100 that season, they and their fans
would have found the past 20 years easier to live with. As it was,
they finished tied with the Yankees, then lost a one-game playoff
for the division title.
</P>
<P>
   But this has been a very good year in spite of the great
distance between them and the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the better ball clubs we've had here in a
while,'' Duquette said, adding that the club feels no frustration
having such a good year but being so far from the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get into the post-season, everybody's the same,'' he
said. ``It's a new schedule. Last year the Marlins as a wild-card
team won the whole thing. In a short series, anything can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox are happening in Boston because of a well-rounded
team that is populated by stars and journeymen alike, all
contributing to the successful season.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows what Mo Vaughn and Nomar Garciaparra can do, but
what about Damon Buford, Darren Bragg, Troy O'Leary and Darren
Lewis? In serving as the team's outfielders, they don't recall the
days of Ted Williams, Carl Yastrzemski, Jim Rice and Fred Lynn. But
they have been productive nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Buford, for example, was an extremely light hitter in four years
with three other teams, but his batting average of .288 is nearly
60 points above his career average of .232. And in slightly more
than half the number of at-bats, he has eclipsed the career high in
home runs (he has 9) and matched the career high in runs batted in
(39) he achieved with Texas last year.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation has resulted from tireless work with the
Boston manager, Jimy Williams, and the hitting coach, Rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to right field; he's not trying to pull
everything,'' Duquette said before Buford went on the disabled list
with a rib-cage injury. ``He's a very dangerous hitter against
lefties. He has an over .500 slugging percentage against them. When
he plays against righties and goes to right field, he's a good
hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who anchors the outfield with his defense in center, has
also contributed offensively, achieving career highs in home runs
(7) and RBI (58). O'Leary's career-high 21 home runs are the most
for a Red Sox outfielder in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   The team's pitching staff, whose earned run average is second to
that of the Yankees, has featured two consistently good starters,
Pedro Martinez (17-4) and Tim Wakefield (15-5), but has also been
aided by the comebacks of Bret Saberhagen (11-6) and Steve Avery
(9-6). Avery's 5.38 ERA is not impressive, but the Red Sox have a
12-6 record in his starts.
</P>
<P>
   The gem of the staff is Tom Gordon, who since withstanding a
possible challenge by Dennis Eckersley has served as a solid
closer, gaining saves in 35 consecutive chances, the longest
current streak in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   What it all means is the Red Sox have the ingredients to play
well in the post-season. Their lack of a fifth starter should have
no effect on them in October, and the presence of Mike Stanley as
the designated hitter should. In other words, there is ammunition
to fuel The Fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a great story, what a great New England story,'' Duquette
said, readily buying into The Fantasy. Then the general manager
added the clincher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We apologized to Babe Ruth two weeks ago,'' he said, beginning
to laugh. ``His daughter was here and threw out the first ball. The
Red Sox apologized to Babe for trading him and asked for his help
in bringing back a World Series championship to the city of Boston.
That could be the touch that puts us over the top.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the days since the House voted to spare the
National Endowment for the Arts, and made clear that the stay of
execution was more or less permanent, the new chairman of the
agency has begun talking out loud about all that suddenly seems
possible: more money, less rancor, even ``a New Deal without the
Depression, with murals painted all over the country and music
composed.''
</P>
<P>
   Just two months after arriving from Nashville, where he ran the
Country Music Foundation for 27 years, William Ivey is taking a
victory lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time I leave the chairmanship,'' Ivey said in a recent
interview, ``the federal role in the arts should be equal to our
role in the Department of Defense.''
</P>
<P>
   That is big talk from someone whose agency was at one point
slated to go out of existence this year. But when asked if he
really thought Congress would pony up for parity between modern
dance and smart bombs, he backed off only an inch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm primarily thinking of the DOD in terms of its
significance,'' he said, and added that federal financing for the
arts was vital to the country's ``internal defense.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day after last month's House vote, which the arts world
hailed as a major turning point, Ivey met with old and new friends
of the arts in Congress and sorted through congratulatory messages,
including one from his predecessor, the actress Jane Alexander, who
spent most of her five-year tenure at the agency in survival mode.
Later in the day he gave a little reception in his office for a
giddy bunch of arts lobbyists talking about the ``new
environment.'' And when he told them to celebrate by grabbing some
extra cookies on their way out, most did.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't usually serve them cookies, but they deserve it,''
said the NEA's longtime spokeswoman, Cherie Simon, a veteran of
battles that seem to have left her half-afraid that some critic
might mount an objection to the endowment's runaway brownie budget.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, even some of the conservatives who tried
hardest to kill the arts agency now seem at least open to Ivey. The
House majority leader, Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, recently praised
the new chairman's ties to country music, saying, ``That's got to
make him a good man, doesn't it?'' Another Republican, Sen. Jesse
Helms, wished Ivey every success after a meeting in which they
chatted about the country singer Randy Travis, who is from North
Carolina, Helms' home state.
</P>
<P>
   Ivey, 53, is not a native Southerner, having grown up in a small
town in Michigan. But he is not a New Yorker, either, and that
seems to be a selling point to those critics who have seen the
agency mostly as a source of financing for East Village graffiti
artists, despite the NEA's considerable efforts to play up its
grants to Midwestern basket weavers and regional theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it helped that he's from somewhere else,'' Ms.
Alexander said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   As John Brademas, chairman of the President's Committee on the
Arts and Humanities, put it, ``He's thoughtful, intelligent,
sophisticated,'' and, with his Middle American pedigree and country
music background, ``no one can charge him with being a wild man.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   It has been three years since Republican partisans of the
Gingrich revolution, in a rage over several late-1980s NEA grants
that supported such controversial works as a photograph of a
crucifix in a container of urine, vowed to end federal financing
for the arts. A number of factors appear to have influenced the
recent turnaround, among them a Supreme Court decision in June that
upheld congressionally imposed decency standards for the endowment.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many conservatives had already been mollified by a
40 percent cut in financing for the agency two years ago. And
several lawmakers say the personal pull of Rep. Sidney Yates, an
Illinois Democrat and longtime arts advocate who is retiring after
this year, was a consideration. Many of his colleagues did not want
his career to end on such a down note.
</P>
<P>
   Another force at work was the moderating effect of the coming
congressional elections and the lobbying of constituencies back
home. Grass-roots supporters of the endowment, who had become less
inclined to fight among themselves while it was under attack,
pressured their representatives in Congress, often with the backing
of Republican business leaders who serve on the boards of arts
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, as promised, the House voted no money for the
endowment in this fiscal year. But the Senate decided on $98
million for it. When the moderates prevailed in a conference
committee and pushed the Senate version through, much of the credit
went to lobbyists back home, especially in Washington State, where
a group of Boeing executives had been able to convert Sen. Slade
Gorton, chairman of the subcommittee that oversees the agency.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Ms. Alexander said, ``We pretty much knew we were
home free.''
</P>
<P>
   In this summer's battle for financing, Ivey is credited with
closing the deal for a number of last-minute converts in the House
by putting Republicans at ease, particularly with his support for
the recent Supreme Court decision. Still, the margin of victory
when the House voted by 253 to 173 last month to retain the current
level of financing next year stunned even the NEA's most optimistic
supporters. The Senate will now vote, and the agency expects a
modest increase in the final bill.
</P>
<P>
   In September, as part of its effort to mend fences with Congress
by making sure grants go to all 50 states, the endowment will
announce the first round of grants to states that have received the
fewest in the past. Other big projects in the works are a
preservation program for outdoor sculpture and a program that will
take composers to communities across the country, where they will
live for a time and write music inspired by the area: ``a very cool
project,'' Ivey promised.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it is impossible not to notice that Ivey is having
fun in a job that could never have been described that way when Ms.
Alexander held it. (``I'm peachy!'' he sang when asked how he was
while shaking hands with a reporter.) He says his success is a
tribute to what can happen when a person pursues a passion without
worrying too much about pursuing any certain job. After growing up
on the jazz that his father, a trumpet player, and his mother, a
pianist, courted to in the 1930s, he fell in love with the folk
music of the Kingston Trio in high school. He took up the guitar,
then studied folklore in college and ethnomusicology in graduate
school before joining the Country Music Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Country was kind of unfashionable in intellectual circles and
seen as a hayseed art form,'' said Bruce Dobie, a friend of Ivey's
who is the editor of The Nashville Scene, an alternative newspaper.
``Bill was able to communicate its importance to the media,
academics and people whose art form might be considered a little
more adventuresome or modern.'' Now he wants to do the same for the
often-reviled endowment.
</P>
<P>
   When the call about the chairmanship came from the Clinton
administration this spring, Ivey sold his Nashville home in 72
hours and assumed the post without even token opposition: Senate
confirmation hearings were deemed unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``A little part of me was disappointed that I didn't get to sit
there and tell my story,'' he said. ``But everyone I tell that
says, `Oh, it's better without a hearing.' '' &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: WOMEN HAVE BETTER PLOTS AT THE OPEN  
 (JT )
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The era of Arthur Ashe Stadium picks up where it left
off. The men can still hit harder, but the women are more
interesting.
</P>
<P>
   By far the most exciting moment in the first year of the new
joint was the shoulder-to-shoulder confrontation between Irina
Spirlea and Venus Williams during the normally placid changeover.
All the men did was hit rockets past each other.
</P>
<P>
   The women could very well be the more captivating gender when
the U.S. Open begins Monday in Queens. The National Tennis Center
was buzzing Saturday for the annual Arthur Ashe Kids' Day, with
clinics for children on the outer courts and tennis high jinks in
the stadium named for the American sporting hero who died too
young.
</P>
<P>
   Ashe was a pacific man, in control of his emotions even when
trying to keep Little McNasty and Little Jimbo from throwing sand
and tossing blocks in the Davis Cup playpen, back when men's tennis
was childish but fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   Ashe surely never would have condoned tennis players, male or
female, acting out the Clint Eastwood question of ``Feel lucky,
punk?'' which Spirlea and Williams did in their little collision
during their semifinal match.
</P>
<P>
   However, he has become a touchstone for equality and
opportunity, since he was the first African-American male to win
Grand Slam events, the first big-bucks Open in 1968 and then
Wimbledon in 1975. The women, in charisma if not in depth or
velocity, are staging their own revolution.
</P>
<P>
   When Ashe won the first Open _ the tournament had previously
been a so-called amateur event, with money passed under the table _
the winners' prizes were $14,000 for the men and $6,000 for the
women.
</P>
<P>
   The disparity continued until 1973, after a latter-day
Lysistrata named Billie Jean King led women to stay away unless
prize money was equal. Because of her lobbying, both singles prizes
that year were $25,000, and have escalated evenly ever since.
(Somebody should name a stadium for Billie Jean, too.)
</P>
<P>
   Male players, and fans of male players, have often insisted that
men should have higher prize money because they allegedly sell more
tickets and generate higher television ratings and sponsorships.
That was surely a valid point in the days of
Connors-Borg-McEnroe-Lendl-Edberg-Becker. But these days, male
tennis is basically Pete Sampras and 100 terrific players who could
knock his block off if he had a bad day.
</P>
<P>
   The women hardly have that kind of depth, with the first week
being essentially a matter of crossing the tracks without touching
the third rail. However, the women can also play, and they bring a
mixture of competitiveness and personality and vulnerability to
this Open.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the story lines: Steffi Graf is testing her
reconstructed knee as a last alternative to becoming glorious
history. Martina Hingis has actually lost a match or two this year.
Monica Seles is discovering what is left after the double tragedy
of her stabbing and her father's death. Jana Novotna still plays
with a feathery grace now that she carries the Wimbledon plate.
Arantxa Sanchez Vicario outlasted them all at Roland Garros.
Lindsay Davenport has buffed her physique and her attitude. The
precocious Anna Kournikova draws the largest gallery of any
15th-seeded player in tennis. Mary Pierce and Mirjana Lucic have
father problems.
</P>
<P>
   You could make an argument that the four most interesting people
in tennis are named Williams _ Venus and Serena, the players, and
Richard and Oracene, the parents.
</P>
<P>
   There are a thousand reasons for missing Arthur Ashe, and one of
them is wondering what his take would have been on these two
African-American sisters with the clattering colored beads in their
corn rows, who took their own bootstrapping, quirky path to Arthur
Ashe Stadium. The Williams family talks about feeling like
outsiders in the locker rooms and lounges and hospitality suites of
tennis.
</P>
<P>
   The eyes-front approach caused Venus to claim a swath of
courtside last year, and Spirlea refused to concede the turf,
swerving into a collision that made spectators gasp. Later, the
father made some inflammatory comments about Spirlea _ from a
distance _ for which he has long since apologized. It was a year
ago, a long time. I can't help feeling that Arthur Ashe, with his
penchant for inspired schmoozing, with his dedication to peaceful
progress, would have found a way to make the Williamses feel more
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   It must be noted that the problem is not with the fans, who seem
grateful for some new blood in tennis. Saturday, Ashe Stadium would
rock with the music of the Backstreet Boys, the antics of John
McEnroe and Andre Agassi, the quips of Bill Cosby, during the Ashe
Day celebration in the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   And the crowd loves the Williamses. The paying customers, who
follow Jordan and Rodman, Griffey and Jeter, Tiger and Deion and
Jackie, are surely comfortable with two sisters with beads and
backhands.
</P>
<P>
   Women's tennis is interesting. But in the Arthur Ashe spirit of
equality, we will let the men share equal prize money. It's only
fair.

</P>
<P>
   Scott Brosius has batted eighth or ninth in the Ne York Yankees'
lineup this season in most of the games he has started. Entering
Saturday's game against Seattle, Brosius had driven in 82 runs.
Seven teams, including the Mets and the Anaheim Angels, the
American League West leaders, do not have anyone who has driven in
82 runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize that was the case,'' Brosius said. ``I've
never thought about it.'' He then proceeded to make light of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure it has much meaning at all,'' he said. ``RBI's
are a result of being on a good team and being around other good
players. I don't have tons of home runs, so RBI's are coming
because other guys are on base. If guys in front of me aren't doing
their job, there wouldn't be anybody to drive in.''
</P>
<P>
   But the third baseman acknowledged: ``I enjoy hitting with men
on base. That's the fun of the game, driving in runs and scoring
runs. I enjoy that opportunity, and in this lineup, I've had lots
of opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   John Olerud leads the Mets with 80 RBI; Darin Erstad leads the
Angels with 75. Other teams and their leaders who lag behind
Brosius: Arizona, Devon White, 78; Florida, Cliff Floyd, 78;
Cincinnati, Bret Boone, 74; Minnesota, Marty Cordova, 65, and Tampa
Bay, Fred McGriff, 64.
</P>
<P>
   Winning Is the Thing, Or Is It?
</P>
<P>
   The Anaheim Angels have the only division lead that is not in
double figures, but they have gained the most notable achievement
of the season: winning the season series from the Yankees, six
games to five.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Indians, who have held a double-digit division
lead since the second game after the All-Star Game break, gained
another sort of distinction. From July 31 through Aug. 22, the
Indians won 8 games and lost 13 but added a game to their lead.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Numbers
</P>
<P>
   According to the team and standard style, the Yankees went into
their weekend series with Seattle 60 games over .500. But they did
not. With a 96-36 record, they had 60 more victories than losses,
but they were 30 games over .500.
</P>
<P>
   The ``60 over'' presumes a 36-36 record as .500, but the Yankees
had played 132 games, meaning a .500 record would be 66-66. With 96
victories, that meant they were 30 over.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the Yankees' major league ``record'' of holding
leads in 48 consecutive games. The Yankees did not win all 48
games. They had a lead at some point in all of the games, but lost
11 of them.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, what is the record for most leads
squandered in a record streak of games in which a team had the
lead? The Yankees lost their leads in 21 of those games, meaning
they held the leads only 56 percent of the time.

   CHIVINGTON, Colo. _ One historian calls it the American My Lai.
Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado, the lone American Indian
in Congress, calls it ``one of the most disgraceful moments of
American history.''
</P>
<P>
   But 134 years after 700 U.S. Army volunteers stormed through an
Indian encampment near here on the Big Sandy Creek, slaughtering
scores of women and children, Colorado's killing fields have
disappeared into the swirling dust and endless horizons of big sky
country.
</P>
<P>
   William Dawson, a retired judge, says the massacre occurred on
what is now part of his ranch. ``The killing was all along here,
under the trees,'' Dawson said recently, surveying a swath of leafy
cottonwoods that snaked along the dry bed of Big Sandy Creek.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to a bluff, he said: ``Up there I found U.S. Army
jacket buttons, with the eagles on them. Over there, I found an
Indian ax head.''
</P>
<P>
   No, says Mike Koury, a military history publisher, this was not
the site. ``There were 700 soldiers firing rifles, artillery pieces
_ cannonballs exploding, bullets flying _ tons of metal should be
found at the site, not pounds,'' Koury said, noting the paltry
number of artifacts found on Dawson's ranch. ``The Indians left
behind pots, pans, axes, saws. Your metal detector should go crazy.
There is no way that is Sand Creek.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Ellis, a history professor leading an official search
for the site of what became known as the Sand Creek Massacre, said,
``When we think of battle sites on American soil, this is the only
major battlefield we can't find.''
</P>
<P>
   New forces are pushing for a solution to this archaeological
mystery. National politics coupled with Indian desires for
recognition of their history are converging on this tiny hamlet in
southeastern Colorado, named after John Chivington, the Methodist
minister turned Army colonel who led the troops in the massacre.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the Senate unanimously passed a bill sponsored by
Campbell, a Northern Cheyenne, ordering the National Park Service
to find the massacre site, a first step to establishing a ``Sand
Creek Massacre National Historic Site.'' Within days, a companion
bill was introduced in the House by Rep. Bob Schaeffer, who
represents Colorado's Eastern plains, which includes the massacre
site.
</P>
<P>
   In Oklahoma and Montana, the roughly 5,000 Cheyenne and Arapaho
descendants of massacre survivors are organizing to lobby for
reparations promised in an 1865 treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, in explaining the interest, said, ``It is clearly one
of the darkest pages in Colorado history.''
</P>
<P>
   Sand Creek, historians say, explains a cartographic oddity: why
eastern Colorado once teemed with Indians but now has no Indian
reservation. Studying the killings as ``ethnic cleansing'' helps
students understand atrocities elsewhere in the world, says Thomas
Noel, a University of Colorado history professor.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1864, the Cheyenne dog soldiers, an autonomous
military wing of the Cheyenne tribe, unleashed bloody attacks on
whites in Colorado's eastern plains. They stole horses and mules
and butchered cattle. They wiped out wagon trains, burned
stagecoach stations and tore down telegraph lines.
</P>
<P>
   The economy of the 3-year-old Colorado territory ground to a
halt as wagon trains with gold-mining equipment could not leave St.
Louis. Food prices soared as farmers abandoned crops.
</P>
<P>
   Chivington, a Civil War hero and Colorado's military commander,
called for volunteer ``Indian fighters'' for 100-day enlistments.
On Nov. 29, 1864, the colonel and his volunteers rode deep inside
the Arapaho-Cheyenne reservation, where Indians led by the Cheyenne
chief Black Kettle had set up camp weeks earlier. A white flag and
an American flag flew above the teepee of Black Kettle, whom the
colonel had met two months earlier near Denver in inconclusive
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the Cheyenne dog soldiers were not camped with
Black Kettle's group did not stop Chivington from unleashing his
attack.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for Chivington's deep hatred of Indians was offered
recently by his 85-year-old great-great-grandson, Laurence Riordan,
who lives in Denver. In 1861, Riordan said, a Ute Indian had raped
the colonel's 17-year-old daughter in western Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   At Sand Creek, Chivington exhorted his troops, ``Remember our
murdered women and children!''
</P>
<P>
   After emptying wagonloads of anti-personnel cannon fire into the
village of 125 teepees, according to historical accounts, the
soldiers swept up the creek bed, killing every Indian they could
find, often hunting down fleeing children. After six hours, about
150 Indians, or one-quarter of the camp's population, lay dead. The
soldiers took three prisoners, all children. A dozen soldiers were
killed, some apparently by friendly fire in the frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Coloradans hailed the soldiers, who had mutilated Indian bodies
for souvenirs. But news of Sand Creek was poorly received in
Washington. President Lincoln replaced Colorado's territorial
governor. A congressional inquiry condemned the battle as a
massacre.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad feeling that our ancestors were attacked in that
manner,'' Laird Cometsevah, president of the Southern Cheyenne Sand
Creek Descendants Association, said from his home in Clinton, Okla.
``Black Kettle basically wanted peace for his people. The Cheyenne
trusted the non-Indians _ and they were betrayed.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A grandson of a survivor, Cometsevah testified this summer at
the Senate hearings on Sand Creek in Denver and Washington. In
addition to seeking the reparations of land and horses specified in
the 1865 treaty, Cometsevah wants the massacre site to be
identified and protected.
</P>
<P>
   As for the 20th-century archaeological mystery here, the Park
Service plans this fall to sweep Big Sandy Creek with a new, highly
sensitive metal detector that can detect metal 2 feet below ground,
double normal depths. In addition, a geomorphologist is to take
soil-core samples to determine what was the historical impact of
flash floods, whether the creek channel shifted over the last
century, and if there is a charred layer of sediment consistent
with the burning of the Indian village.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at Dawson's ranch, skeptics compare the handful of
artifacts unearthed to the 7,000 found at the Little Big Horn
battlefield after a wildfire swept over that site in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   But Doug Scott, a Park Service archaeologist who has worked at
both sites, noted differences. Custer's last stand was on a hilltop
that was preserved as a memorial three years after the battle. In
Sand Creek, fighting was on a flood plain that was later farmed and
picked over for souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   But even if artifacts are sparse here, the pressure is on to
find a site.
</P>
<P>
   ``There never has been closure for the Cheyenne people, said
David Halaas, Colorado's chief state historian. ``It still is an
open wound.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the massacre of Vietnamese civilians by Army
troops, Halaas said, ``Sand Creek was the My Lai of the 19th
century.''

ISSUE OF CONCUSSIONS SURROUNDS AIKMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is the Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman considering
retiring if he receives another concussion?
</P>
<P>
   The answer depends on whom you ask. Aikman, who has had five
concussions since being drafted by the Cowboys in 1989 and seven
since he began playing football, recently told several people close
to him that if he receives another substantial concussion this
year, he will retire at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The people who spoke to Aikman said the quarterback was
extremely concerned about his long-term mental health. Aikman is
one of the top-paid players in the league and, at age 31, he may
think that it is becoming less worth risking his health to play the
game.
</P>
<P>
   One of the people Aikman spoke to said that Aikman ``wasn't
wishy-washy when he said it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was like, `If I get another bad one, I'm gone.'''
</P>
<P>
   That person, based on his conversation with Aikman, said that if
Aikman received a severe concussion early in the season, he might
even retire before the season ended.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, however, dispute this, saying that Aikman is no
more worried about the possibility of a concussion now than he had
been. A team spokesman said anyone stating that Aikman has made a
definite decision to retire if he receives another concussion is
``exaggerating.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet other Cowboys officials concede that Aikman is in a special
situation. His agent, Leigh Steinberg, for years has pushed for
more awareness about the damaging effects of concussions, and some
Cowboys officials feel if Aikman did suffer another concussion,
even possibly a mild one, Steinberg might ask Aikman to retire.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Steinberg advised the San Francisco quarterback Steve
Young, another of his clients, to seriously consider retiring after
receiving two concussions in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman could not be reached for comment. But when the Pro Bowl
quarterback was asked recently by a reporter how much longer he
thought he was going to play, Aikman said, ``I'm going to play
until I can't play anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   If Aikman is concerned, it is understandable. Staying in the
pocket while taking a hit has become a sort of trademark for him.
Although he has generally been well protected in the past because
of a great offensive line, the few times Aikman has been hit he has
taken tremendous shots.
</P>
<P>
   In the conference title game against the San Francisco 49ers on
Jan. 23, 1994, Aikman received one of his worst concussions after a
brutal hit in the third quarter. In October 1994 against Arizona,
Aikman suffered a mild concussion. Last year against Philadelphia,
he also suffered a mild concussion.
</P>
<P>
   Another hard hit to his head and Aikman would have to make a
decision other athletes who have endured repeated concussions were
forced to make: is their mental health worth another chance for a
championship?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Cowboys would hate to lose Aikman, especially
this season. Dallas has looked average during the preseason, going
without a victory (0-5) for the first time in 12 years. Usually,
the exhibition season means nothing, but the two other years the
Cowboys failed to win an exhibition game, they went on to losing
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' first-team offense has scored only three touchdowns
in 15 possessions. Imagine what would happen if they lost Aikman
during the season and had to go with the backup, Jason Garrett.
</P>
<P>
   If Aikman did retire at the end of this season because of a
concussion, his place in NFL history would be assured. He has had
the dream career. He is one of only three players to lead a team to
three Super Bowl victories and is one of the most accurate passers
in the history of the NFL. His mark has been made. He is going to
the Hall of Fame. The challenge for Aikman is to get there in one
piece.

SAINTS HAZERS STILL IN HIDING 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   While the NFL continues to investigate the bizzare hazing
incident involving New Orleans Saints players, one thing has become
clear: There were many more veteran players doing the hazing than
was originally thought.
</P>
<P>
   A number of rookies, including the second-round pick Cam
Cleeland, had pillow cases placed over their heads and were forced
to run a gantlet of veterans who punched, kicked, elbowed and
bloodied some of the rookies as they ran down the line.
</P>
<P>
   At first it was thought there were only a handful of veterans
doing the hazing. The only one to come forward so far is linebacker
Andre Royal, who spoke to security officials from the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   And what of threats about lawsuits, especially since Cleeland
suffered damaged vision as a result of the hazing?
</P>
<P>
   Any player who is still in the NFL is unlikely to win a lawsuit
against the Saints, the NFL or another player, mainly because the
collective bargaining agreement forces disputes to go before an
arbitrator, meaning many suits are thrown out of civil court and
sent to arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   Lowdown on Blocking Sleds
</P>
<P>
   Coaches and players around the NFL may want to pay close
attention to an underpublicized but potentially significant medical
study published in the May issue of the American Journal of Sports
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School at
Rutgers University concluded that the act of linemen repeatedly
hitting massive blocking sleds during practice may be the reason
they have a higher incidence of injuries to the lower spine than
other players.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting blocking sleds is almost an everyday ritual for
offensive and defensive linemen and linebackers. Players charge
into the heavy sleds, slamming into them with great force, and
there is often a coach standing on them, adding another 200-plus
pounds to the weight.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect the use of blocking sleds to stop. Coaches see
them as a necessity for training.
</P>
<P>
   Miscellany
</P>
<P>
   _ Just applying to purchase the Cleveland Browns is expensive.
The seven prospective owners had to pay an application fee of
$150,000 simply to get into the bidding process. Plus, they have
probably spent double that making presentations to owners.
</P>
<P>
   _ The San Francisco wide receiver Jerry Rice will most likely
restructure his deal soon to make more salary cap room for the
49ers.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Kansas City Chiefs' decision not to sign running back
Lawrence Phillips was made because they do not think he is a
talented back. Their decision had little to do with his off-field
problems.
</P>
<P>
   _ Now that Denver quarterback John Elway has won a Super Bowl,
the new sentimental favorite to win a championship is Miami's Dan
Marino, who will turn 37 on Sept. 15. &QL;

MTA IS JUST BEGINNING TO REVIEW CONTRACT TO REPUBLICAN POLITICAL
DONOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Five months after a state agency vowed to scrutinize
its awarding of a $97 million contract to a Republican political
donor, its investigators have done little if anything to pursue the
inquiry, failing even to interview losing bidders who contend that
the process was biased.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1997, the agency, the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority, gave the contract to repair the Queens-Midtown Tunnel to
Silverite Construction, a Long Island company that is owned by one
of the biggest financial backers of Gov. George Pataki and the
Republican State Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The authority had originally determined that Silverite and its
partner in the venture, Frontier-Kemper Constructors of Evansville,
Ind., lacked the experience for the four-year tunnel project, one
of the largest state contracts in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   But Silverite, of Hicksville, N.Y., then changed its application
and got the contract. In the days just before and after the award,
the Republican State Committee received several donations, totaling
$100,000, from contributors linked to Silverite's owner, according
to disclosure records.
</P>
<P>
   Both the authority and Silverite's owner, Angelo Silveri, said
the donations had nothing to do with the contract. But after The
New York Times disclosed the timing of the donations in March, the
authority's chairman, E. Virgil Conway, asked its inspector general
to do a ``complete review'' of the contract. At the same time, two
teams of federal prosecutors issued subpoenas and began grand jury
investigations into the contract.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the authority's inspector general, Roland Malan,
acknowledged that his office was just beginning to look at the
tunnel job and had not yet interviewed authority employees or
bidders about it. ``Our investigation is at the point where we are
just about to get ready,'' he said. ``We are not into it yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Malan said he had decided to postpone the inquiry because his
office was not able to obtain authority records connected to the
contract until earlier this month. He said the authority had sent
the records in the spring to an outside law firm that the authority
had hired to help it respond to the grand jury investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why his office had not simply requested copies of the
records from the law firm in the spring, he said: ``I don't know
the answer to that. There is a delay in getting the records that I
can't explain.''
</P>
<P>
   Malan, who was appointed by Pataki and whose office is
semi-independent of the authority, denied that the delay stemmed
from political considerations related to the gubernatorial
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nonsense,'' said Malan. ``No one has interfered one iota
in anything that we have done.''
</P>
<P>
   He expressed confidence that the investigation would not be
hindered by the delay. But he added that he had decided not to
examine any role that political contributions might have played in
the award, saying that he would leave that to the federal
prosecutors. He said he would focus only on how the authority's
staff conducted the contracting process.
</P>
<P>
   In March, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn and Manhattan began
separate investigations into the tunnel contract, but the Manhattan
office later withdrew. The Brooklyn prosecutors have refused to
discuss their inquiry, which is continuing, but an executive at one
of the losing bidders who was interviewed by the prosecutors said
they appeared to be closely examining how the contracting process
was conducted.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``It sounded to me like they were looking for somebody in the
authority who was responsible for giving the contract to the
Silverite group,'' the executive, Peter Schneidkraut, president of
Grow Tunneling, said on Friday. ``They asked me whom at the
authority I had dealt with. And as recently as three or four weeks
ago, I got a call asking about a lower-level guy who was involved
in the awarding of the contract. He is sort of a lower-level guy
who was probably told what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Schneidkraut said he had not been summoned before the grand jury
but expected that he might be. He said he had not been contacted by
the inspector general's office. ``You would think that they would
want to hear what our complaints were,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are also investigating an earlier, $14.1 million
contract to repair the Queens-Midtown Tunnel that Silverite won in
1993 and was then accused by the authority of mismanaging. The
company was never penalized for its performance on that project and
was even paid extra by the authority.
</P>
<P>
   The authority gave the additional money to Silverite in 1995,
soon after the governor and his senior economic development adviser
attended a party for the Pataki campaign at Silveri's home in
Oyster Bay, N.Y. Silveri raised more than $100,000 in 1995 for
Pataki and the Republicans. Pataki aides said there was no
connection between the donations and how Silverite was treated by
the authority.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are also examining whether Silveri used other people
to funnel his contributions to Pataki and the Republicans, a
process that could be illegal under federal or state law, lawyers
involved in the case said. In early April, Silveri released a
statement in which he called articles in The Times about his
company ``entirely false.'' He then referred to contributions that
had been recorded as having been made by his family members and
business associates as having been made by him.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, he described a ``$100,000 contribution I made to
Governor Pataki's 1994 campaign,'' when in fact the money was
recorded by the campaign as several donations from him and family
members. When Silveri's lawyer, Edward Shaw, was asked in an
interview about the statement, he said that it had been
accidentally worded incorrectly and would be changed.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's office did not respond last week to requests for comment
on the tunnel contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic gubernatorial contenders have pointed to the
contract as evidence of what they say are the Pataki
administration's ethical problems. Told on Friday about the delay
in the inspector general's investigation, one candidate, James
Larocca, asserted that it was caused by politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to assume that their motivation is to take this out
of the political season,'' Larocca said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about such criticism, Michael Marr, a spokesman for the
Pataki campaign, read a statement: ``The State Democratic Party
chairwoman recently said of President Clinton's 18-month
extramarital affair with Monica Lewinsky, `Everybody screws up once
in a while or is entitled to one lapse.' And not one of the
Democratic gubernatorial candidates questioned her statement. As a
result, it is difficult to take anything they say seriously.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Aug. 30:
</P>
<P>
   Two days of summitry, starting Tuesday, between the politically
wounded leaders of the United States and Russia are shaping up as a
surreal encounter in which real diplomatic business will be hard to
transact. Given the rapid deterioration in Russia last week, it
probably would have been best to postpone this trip at least until
the lineaments of the new political and economic situation could be
more clearly discerned.
</P>
<P>
   But since both sides have decided to go as planned, President
Clinton can try to put the visit to good use.
</P>
<P>
   The planned itinerary will give Clinton several opportunities to
speak directly, on television, to the Russian people. With
Communists surging in power and nationalists waiting expectantly in
the wings, he should encourage the Russians not to give up on
democracy and free-market economics in the despair of the current
crisis. He should also caution them to resist the false notion that
recovery can be painless with a return to discredited policies.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever short-term relief might be bought by printing rubles
and renationalizing factories and banks will be paid for many times
over in extra suffering by workers, savers and consumers as
investment evaporates and inflation rockets out of control in the
years ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his entourage must try to learn more from President
Boris Yeltsin and Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin about
their troubling concessions to the Communist-dominated parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Yeltsin's emissary is expected to sign an agreement with
the Communists on coordinating economic policy and diluting the
powers of the presidency. Temporary compromises with opposition
groups may be necessary to get through the present political
rapids. But the United States and the world must worry if these
steps mark a long-term retreat from reform.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their faults, Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin represent the
best hope for maintaining minimal international economic
credibility. They should concede no more than is absolutely
necessary to re-establish political stability.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his advisers should also use this visit to build
working relationships with other leading Russian politicians,
including Yeltsin's sometime ally, sometime rival, Alexander Lebed;
Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov; Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov
and reformers like Boris Nemtsov.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, whose weakness is on painful display, may survive the
current political crisis. But he no longer dominates the political
scene, and Washington must begin to think about possible
successors. By reaching out to other leaders, Clinton can
underscore America's long-term interest in Russia's evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and the Russian leadership have a fair amount of foreign
policy business to discuss, including differences over Kosovo, Iraq
and Russian missile sales to Iran. While it is probably unrealistic
to expect any increased Russian cooperation, there is symbolic
value in continued discussions.
</P>
<P>
   By traveling to Moscow at such an uncertain time, Clinton runs
the risk that even a well-planned agenda could be buffeted by new
economic or political turbulence he can neither foresee nor
control. He may also encounter renewed questioning about his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky, an issue that still requires a
fuller explanation from the president.
</P>
<P>
   But having decided to proceed with the trip, Clinton is obliged
to speak out strongly for political stability, diplomatic
continuity and America's long-term determination to help Russia
establish a viable democracy and a successful market economy. &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A ribbon of clouds with scattered showers and isolated
thunderstorms will stretch from the middle Atlantic coast to south
Texas. This band of moisture marks the remnants of a weak cool
front. A wedge of somewhat drier but warm air will cover the region
from southern New England to the central Appalachians and into the
lower Ohio Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian air will surge southward into the Great Lakes, but the
front will only make slow progress eastward. A few thundershowers
will likely erupt ahead of the front Sunday afternoon. Breezy and
cooler conditions are expected in the northern Great Lakes in the
wake of the front.
</P>
<P>
   The southeast coast will be sultry and Florida will notice an
increase in the number of afternoon storms. East of the Bahamas,
strengthening hurricane Danielle will begin its turn to the north
on Sunday. Swells from the storm should reach the southeast shores.
</P>
<P>
   Several thunderstorms will erupt in eastern Wyoming, northern
Colorado and Nebraska as a disturbance moves through the region.
Afternoon storms will form over the southern Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure stretching from Utah to off the northwest coast
will promote sunny and hot weather throughout the West. Record heat
is likely from interior Oregon to the deserts of the Southwest.
Maritime air will stay close to the California coast, but the
central valley will be torrid. Meanwhile, a few thunderstorms will
likely erupt Sunday afternoon in the Sierra. Farther north, coastal
clouds and fog will linger near the Olympic peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Matching Patterns
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had Hurricane Bonnie departed from the northeast coast
than Hurricane Danielle churned to a position similar to Hurricane
Bonnie's location last weekend. Oddly, while East Coast residents
were cleaning up and watching the second hurricane, people along
Japan's Pacific coast were boarding up for a close call with
Typhoon Rex. This powerful typhoon will pass just east of Tokyo on
Sunday before curving into the North Pacific. All indications from
computer data are that Hurricane Danielle should also curve north,
sparing the United States' East Coast.

EDITORIAL: SAVE THE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Aug. 30:
</P>
<P>
   Americans who have been exhausted by the scandals in Washington
may be looking forward to the year 2000, when they will have a
chance to pick a new set of presidential candidates. But those who
are expecting a long, deliberative process of popular selection may
be doomed to disappointment. Unless some order is imposed soon, the
next series of presidential primaries will be over almost the day
it starts.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since primaries became the core of the nominating process,
states have been scheduling them earlier and earlier. In 2000, New
Yorkers will vote for presidential candidates March 7, as will most
of New England in a new Yankee Day primary. Virtually every other
region is nursing the same idea, and mulling a Prairie Day, a
Mid-Atlantic Day or a West Coast Day for March 7, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like a college bowl lineup, and is likely to last
about as long. Even if some plans fall through, the nominations
would almost certainly be decided by the mid-March flurry of
Southern primaries known as Super Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   This makeshift national primary would combine the worst features
of the old boss system and modern big-money politics. Victory would
almost inevitably go to the candidates who had the most funds for
TV commercials and the most support from state party leaders who
could set up local organizations quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Although the fabled ``retail'' primary in New Hampshire and the
Iowa caucus would continue to come first, their results would be
practically meaningless. A less well-financed, less well-known
candidate who broke through to capture the hearts of New Hampshire
voters would have only days to take advantage of the victory before
slamming into the wall of regional primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The states know that this leapfrogging is hurting the primary
system, but local political leaders want to be sure that they and
their constituents are not left out in the cold while other parts
of the country make the real decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize it's too early, but the bottom line is _ that's
not our fault,'' said a spokesman for the sponsor of a bill moving
California's primary from June to March 7. Lacking some national
organizing principle, states are going to continue jumping ahead of
one another.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Secretaries of State, whose members
oversee the state primaries, has been perhaps the only group taking
the problem as seriously as it deserves. It is working on a
proposal that would create five regional presidential primaries,
held a month apart, with the order rotating from one election year
to the next. New Hampshire and Iowa would keep their traditional
role as the season openers in February.
</P>
<P>
   That idea, or any variation that would spread out the primary
process, is preferable to the scramble to the front of the line
that exists now. For the people to function as the true kingmakers
in the nominating process, they need time to get to know the
candidates and watch them perform under the fire of a competitive
series of campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Any reform that would take place in time for the 2000 primaries
will have to be accomplished quickly. A committee of secretaries of
state is planning to meet within a month to discuss the issue, but
it will need support from the Republican and Democratic national
committees.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats in particular have taken a hands-off attitude
toward the confusion. That may be because Vice President Al Gore,
as the best-known and best-financed candidate, could have an
advantage if the primaries come early and bunched together.
</P>
<P>
   But the voters deserve better than a nominating process that is
over before they have a chance to think about whom they want in the
race. &QL;

A CATHEDRAL OF BASKETBALL WHERE SOULS SOAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By AMY WALDMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tired and sweat-soaked, the big men left the
basketball court. Within seconds, their smaller shadows _ boys ages
8 to 13 _ had taken their place. They hustled and bumped and called
plays like pros, capturing the attitude, if not the shooting
acumen, of their elders.
</P>
<P>
   These boys spend their summer playing basketball, moving from
open court to open court. But when they can, they settle here, at
the Brownsville Recreation Center on Linden Boulevard in Brooklyn.
Its courts have the only fiberglass backboards in the neighborhood,
but perhaps the real draw is less concrete.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 1,600 parks and playgrounds and innumerable
community centers that provide summer homes to young people
throughout the city. The Brownsville Recreation Center also
provides a second family.
</P>
<P>
   It originally housed the legendary Brownsville Boys Club, and
then declined as the neighborhood did. Now the center is a vibrant
institution in its own right, and the neighborhood is experiencing
something of an upswing, too.
</P>
<P>
   But if the center's history has paralleled the neighborhood's,
its spirit has largely defied it: In a rough area, it is a haven,
where each generation tries to give a hand to the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're good mentors,'' said Henry ``Pepper'' Brent, a senior
counselor this summer and a two-time U.S. Boxing Association
flyweight champion in the early 1980s. ``These kids need role
models.''
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Brownsville has not been an easy place to grow up
in. Pockmarked with abandoned buildings, it has known a
disproportionate share of hardship _ poverty, drugs, crime,
declining schools. The city's largest recent capital investment in
the neighborhood was a showplace $40 million juvenile jail, which
has the dubious advantage of allowing Brownsville youth to serve
time close to home.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can grow up and survive in Brownsville,'' said Greg
Jackson, the center's manager, who did so himself, ``you can do it
anywhere in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, the center, which is financed by the city,
seems no different from the rest of Brownsville. It sits on a truck
route, across from a transit yard, surrounded by auto-salvage
shops. A sign on its drab exterior warns that a metal detector is
in use.
</P>
<P>
   But inside, past the metal detector, a mural of black luminaries
greets visitors _ and so do a sparkling gymnasium, a weight room, a
game room, a swimming pool, a dance studio, a rooftop garden, and a
professional kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, senior citizens take over the weight room; in
the afternoon, bodybuilders do. Doctors and lawyers meet after work
on the handball courts. Two hundred children attended the center's
annual day camp _ a bargain at $225 for the summer, including
twice-weekly trips to places like the Bronx Zoo. Countless other
children come informally, to play and to help.
</P>
<P>
   No one embodies, and has shaped, the center's ethos more than
Jackson. He assumed its management a year ago, but has been
spending time at it since his own childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is a legend partly because he played professional
basketball: He was drafted by the Knicks in 1974 and also played
with the Phoenix Suns. After the NBA, he spent several seasons in
the Continental Basketball Association. This neighborhood has
produced a good many athletic champions, including Mike Tyson and
Riddick Bowe, and they are duly revered.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson is in a class by himself because of what he did
before he played pro ball, and what he has done since. In 1965, at
age 14, he founded the Reeves Drakeford Brownsville Jets, a
basketball team that was open to all comers, regardless of ability.
The only requirement was to try each day to help others, no
questions asked.
</P>
<P>
   Quite a few young men in Brownsville say they owe their lives to
the Jets. ``This place and Riverside Church'' _ which also had a
basketball team _ ``kept me from going to jail,'' said Jeffrey
Wiggins, 28, a former Jet who worked as a playground assistant at
the center this summer.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in the Van Dyke Houses with his grandmother, he said.
``I didn't have no father figure. Everything was basketball to me,
and these guys were father figures.''
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Glenn, 37, the center's recreation supervisor, was a Jet,
too. Jackson virtually adopted him when he was an adolescent, and
when Glenn was thinking of dropping out of prep school, Jackson
threatened to cut off his friendship if he did. Glenn finished
school.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets have endured, along with Jackson's core philosophy:
that everyone deserves an equal chance to have their ability, and
more important, their confidence, nurtured.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know which of these kids are going to be special,
which is going to be Stephon Marbury or World B. Free,'' Jackson
said. Marbury emerged from Coney Island's basketball courts and now
plays for the Minnesota Timberwolves. Free, who played 13 NBA
seasons and was inducted into the New York City Basketball Hall of
Fame last year, was himself a Jet _ not a very good one when he
started, Jackson said _ and still visits the center regularly.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jackson also came back to the neighborhood, and he wants others
to do the same. ``I don't believe in telling them to move out of
the neighborhood,'' he said, ``because to build a strong
neighborhood, you have to have dedication, people with strong
skills.''
</P>
<P>
   His staff seem to have both ample reserves of dedication and
eclectic skills. Vivian Jett, the camp director, was Nell Carter's
understudy in the Broadway production of ``Ain't Misbehavin''' and
still tours with musical productions. The cultural coordinator,
Deborah Britt, is a gospel singer and playwright.
</P>
<P>
   At 40, a still-muscled Pepper Brent goes head to head on the
basketball court with boys one-fourth his age. ``There's nothing
they can do I can't do,'' he boasts. Many of them, he said, are
being raised by single mothers or grandparents. ``They need a male
fixture,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The center itself is proof that change is possible. Nearly a
decade ago, it was in such bad shape that it closed. Built in 1953
as the Brownsville Boys Club, when the neighborhood was mostly
white and Jewish, it weathered Brownsville's racial transformation,
but then it and the neighborhood began to decline.
</P>
<P>
   The basketball courts had no nets when he began playing there 13
years ago, recalled Harold Hines, 22, and the neighborhood had
plenty of trouble. ``You could pick up 50 crack vials on every
block,'' he said. ``There would be gunshots every night.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the city decided to invest $10 million in the center,
and it reopened in 1991. Jackson is clearly proud that its
condition has only improved since then. ``Look at those
backboards,'' he said. ``The kids make sure nothing happens to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long after the center reopened, the neighborhood began to
turn around. The crack trade has receded, and crime has dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things will be a lot better for these kids,'' Hines said.
</P>
<P>
   In part, that is because the ``kids'' want them to be. They
watched peers and elders die or go to jail, and took heed, Hines
noted. ``When you grow up in Brownsville, the law of averages is
that you will know people killed, and you will have a lot of
moments of reflection,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What is in vogue now, Hines said, is getting an education and
getting a job. This fall, he will begin Morgan State University in
Maryland. ``But I'll be back,'' he said, and gestured at the
center's courts. ``This is home.''

<P>
   AYODHYA, India _ The pilgrims stand silently by the hour,
watching artisans chisel giant sandstone pillars for a magnificent
temple to Ram, the ideal manly incarnation of the Hindu god Vishnu.
Only the screeches of wild pink-faced monkeys scampering through
the open-air sheds break the soggy stillness.
</P>
<P>
   The workshop here, and three others in the state of Rajasthan,
are singly and relentlessly devoted to the construction of a
prefabricated temple to Ram on the site that many Hindus believe
was his birthplace _ and that was the scene of one of the greatest
traumas to independent India's secular fabric.
</P>
<P>
   It was here, a little over a mile from the workshop, that a mob
of Hindu militants stormed a 16th-century mosque on Dec. 6, 1992,
and demolished it in a few hours with sledgehammers, crowbars and
their bare hands. The act of destruction set off rioting across the
nation between Muslims and Hindus that left more than 1,000 dead,
most of them Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   The crusade for a temple to Ram here in Ayodhya on the very
place where the mosque once stood has been central to the political
ascendancy of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which
now leads the Indian government. And it has posed one of the
gravest challenges ever to modern India's 50-year tradition as a
secular nation committed to treating people of all faiths justly.
</P>
<P>
   As they campaigned in national elections this year, leaders of
the Bharatiya Janata Party promised they would seek to clear the
way for the temple's construction. The party's manifesto called
efforts to build the temple ``the greatest mass movement in
post-independence history,'' and said they had ``strengthened the
foundation of cultural nationalism.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the party came to power in March at the head of a
coalition government, construction of the temple to Ram was dropped
from the official agenda at the insistence of the party's coalition
partners. The new prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee of the
Bharatiya Janata Party, pledged in June that the temple would be
built only if the courts gave the go-ahead or the nation's laws
were changed to allow it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the issue festers, and it could explode again into
violence. For centuries, India was dominated by Muslim invaders
known as the Moguls, and religious hatreds have periodically flared
ever since. In 1947, when British-ruled India was divided into
predominantly Muslim Pakistan and predominantly Hindu India,
hundreds of thousands were killed in the vast migration of Hindus
to India and Muslims to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Among Muslims and Hindus who abhorred the destruction of the
Babri Mosque here, which was built during the reign of the first
Mogul emperor, Babur, distrust of the Bharatiya Janata Party runs
deep. After all, they say, three of the party's leaders, who are
now Cabinet ministers, face criminal charges of complicity in the
illegal destruction of the mosque in cases that are still pending.
Why should the party's promise to abide by the law be believed now,
they ask. They fear that the prefabricatedtemple will suddenly be
erected by militants, once again tearing the country apart.
</P>
<P>
   Among the core supporters of the Bharatiya Janata Party the
worry is a different one. Those who have pressed doggedly for the
temple are disappointed that the party has not taken bold action on
it since it came to power. They have begun publicly pressing the
party's leaders to deliver on their election commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, a group that has been
closely allied with the Bharatiya Janata Party and that has been at
the forefront of the temple cause, spoke out recently in The Times
of India, criticizing the party for failing to take steps to win
quicker court approval for the temple construction.
</P>
<P>
   They say they rejoiced when the mosque was ``liberated'' in 1992
and plan to lay the temple's foundation in 2001. And they insist
that the temple must be built where the mosque once was because the
site is not only Ram's birthplace, but also where an ancient Hindu
temple stood that was razed by Babur, a contention much disputed by
historians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The birthplace of Lord Ram cannot be changed,'' said Giriraj
Kishore, the secretary general of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad. ``Can
you change the birthplace of Christ? Can you?''
</P>
<P>
   By order of India's Supreme Court, the site is under heavy
security, surrounded by barbed wire and armed guards posted in
watchtowers and along the perimeter. The court has decreed that
there be no construction until a tangle of related court cases are
resolved, a process that could take years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon, a trickle of pilgrims _ bent-over old men
leaning on wooden staffs and gaggles of relatives _ walked through
the metal detector at the entry to the site and lifted their arms
to be patted down for weapons. They then threaded their way along a
narrow corkscrew path, enclosed by a 10-foot-high fence of metal
bars, to a makeshift temple to Ram that was hurriedly raised on the
rubble of the mosque soon after its destruction.
</P>
<P>
   There, the pilgrims reached through the bars to leave offerings
of coins, sweets and flower petals. As they emerged from the site,
a swarm of hawkers offered crude pamphlets for 10 rupees, about a
quarter, with gory photographs from December 1992 of bloodied kar
sewaks, the Hindu volunteers whose rampage brought down the mosque.
</P>
<P>
   In Ayodhya, a matched pair of leaders _ one Hindu, one Muslim _
are keeping the flame of agitation alive through the sultry monsoon
season. The bare-chested Hindu monk who heads the Ram Birthplace
Temple Trust, Ram Chandra Das, was playing cards with his disciples
in the courtyard of his small temple and hurriedly put them away
when visitors arrived. He primped his long, matted hair for a
camera.
</P>
<P>
   He sat cross-legged on a raised platform, and his words grew
more fiery the longer he spoke. His finger jabbing the air and his
yellowish, ragged beard shaking with fervor, the monk, who says he
is 90, defiantly declared that the temple would be built whether
the courts permitted it or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a judgment against God and spirituality, I will
not accept it,'' he said. ``The court cannot decide whether Lord
Ram was born here or not. This will be decided by our religion and
our religious people.''
</P>
<P>
   In a humble house across town, another old man, a gaunt, retired
tailor named Mohammad Hasim Ansari, speaks for the Muslims of
Ayodhya who want the mosque, known as the Babri Masjid, rebuilt.
Ansari, 78, who is chairman of the Babri Masjid Reconstruction
Committee, is still bitter about what happened the day the mosque,
Ayodhya's oldest, was torn down.
</P>
<P>
   As a herd of fat black water buffalo rolled in the mud outside
his door, Ansari recalled how his family had run away while much of
his home was destroyed by Hindus who attacked Muslim homes and
places of worship after destroying the mosque.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't trust the political leaders now,'' he said. ``None of
them came forward to help us.''
</P>
<P>
   But his milky eyes glinted with mischief when he talked about
his Hindu counterpart, Das. The men have known each other for half
a century. Here in this sacred town, where Mogul lords once gave
land grants for the building of Hindu temples, where Hindus and
Muslims lived side by side in peace for centuries, where Muslim
tailors have richly embroidered the finery of Hindu icons, Ansari
mildly called Das ``a nice man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I wasn't here, no one would ask for him,'' Ansari said
wryly. ``And if he wasn't there, nobody would come to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The mundane quality of small-town life was equally palpable at
the workshop here where 40 men are at work carving intricate
designs and the images of Hindu deities into pillars for the
temple. The artisans, far from being inspired by the sacredness of
their task, complained about their wages, which one worker,
Janardhan Sharma, 40, put at a little over $2 a day.
</P>
<P>
   For the pilgrims, too, the material world exists in the same
breath with the spiritual. Ram Kumari, 60, the wife of a tea stall
owner, had come by train from her home in the state of Bihar to pay
her respects to Ram.
</P>
<P>
   A devout Hindu, she said she had voted for the Bharatiya Janata
Party this year, but would not the next time. ``Prices are high,''
said Mrs. Kumari, a housewife with a family to feed. ``Onions are
20 rupees per kilo.''

   NEW YORK _ When Rabbi Peter Rubinstein stood before his Central
Synagogue congregation Saturday morning, many of the eyes he saw
were moist. Usually, Saturday services in the summer are small, but
about 100 people had arrived, some of them crying or hugging one
another, everyone looking for strength a day after a five-alarm
fire roared through their 126-year-old sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   So Rubinstein told them to find strength by looking into the
synagogue's history. ``That building was built by 140 people who
had no resources, who simply had a vision,'' he said. Today, he
noted, the synagogue has 1,400 members, where strength can now be
found.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will rebuild that building,'' he said inside the
synagogue's community center across 55th Street from the main
sanctuary. ``We have work to do, and we shall do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fire broke out in the synagogue at 652 Lexington Ave. on Friday
afternoon, apparently caused by a blowtorch as workmen installed an
air-conditioning system during renovations. Roaring uncontrolled
for three hours, the fire appeared potentially disastrous, but
after meeting Saturday with fire marshals and structural engineers,
Rubinstein said the integrity of the sandstone structure was sound.
</P>
<P>
   Still, repairs are expected to be costly. Asked to estimate how
much money and time it will take to rebuild, Livia Thompson,
executive director of the synagogue, said, ``millions and years.''
Members of the congregation said that insurance adjusters were
inspecting the building Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze originated in the roof, which was destroyed. Much of
the damage was caused when the large roof beams, or tresses,
collapsed. One beam fell on the organ, though some pieces of the
organ had already been removed for the renovation. Other beams
crashed onto the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Construction workers spent Saturday morning shoveling charred
debris out of the sanctuary. Two cranes removed damaged pieces of
the roof. Thousands of gallons of water were pumped out of the
sanctuary, and water damage was extensive.
</P>
<P>
   The fire struck roughly a month before the High Holy Days
services, the most sacred of the year for Jews. Rubinstein said up
to 5,000 people usually attended services at Central Synagogue. He
said several nearby churches and synagogues had already offered
their buildings, but no final decision had yet been made.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will take our Torah scrolls, which we have, and we will
wander for a period of time,'' he said, ``and then in a great
triumphant moment, we will return to that building.''
</P>
<P>
   Fire marshals declined to discuss the blaze.
</P>

<P>
   Central Synagogue, built in 1872, is not the first New York City
religious landmark to catch fire after a construction accident.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1990, a worker using an acetylene torch apparently
caused a blaze at the 142-year-old Episcopal Church of Holy
Apostles in Chelsea. Another accident with a torch was blamed for a
1978 fire that swept through the historic St. Mark's-in-the-Bowery
Episcopal Church at Second Avenue and 10th Street. The church was
built in 1799.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Doebley, an architect with Dan Peter Kopple &AMP; Associates,
said a ``tent roof'' would be erected to protect the sanctuary from
rain. Doebley, whose firm was supposed to begin an interior
restoration of the structure next year, said the stained glass
windows and other historic exterior features of the building were
not damaged.
</P>
<P>
   When Rubinstein announced that the synagogue's Ark had not been
damaged, congregants at Saturday's service sighed in relief. The
synagogue's ritual items _ like Torah scrolls and its century-old
archives _ had been removed in recent months for the renovations.
Two Torah scrolls that had remained in glass cases were saved at
the outset of the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the summer, the congregation has held Saturday
services in the synagogue's community center to allow for
renovations at the main sanctuary. One woman said that as few as 10
people attended some summer services.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first reaction was mental and physical paralysis,'' said
Joseph Dash, who has been a member for more than 20 years. ``This
is truly one of the unique synagogues of the world. The interior is
not to be believed. It was awe-inspiring.''

NO EXIT FOR BABE RUTH OF COLLECTORS

   LIVINGSTON, N.J. _ Barry Halper's mother never gave his baseball
cards away.
</P>
<P>
   She kept all kinds of baseball stuff that mothers have thrown
out, sacrificed to garage sales and tossed in the boxes for
Goodwill in that time-honored tradition so many mothers are later
made to regret.
</P>
<P>
   The wrinkled piece of paper Babe Ruth signed, the ball Cy Young
autographed at an old-timers' game, the 75 uniforms gathered from
ballplayers who had come to know Barry Halper as the kid who would
take any baseball souvenir as long as you signed it _ they were all
where he left them in his mom's house in Newark when he happened
upon them one day, many years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Halper, who grew up to run his family's wholesale
paper-products company in Elizabeth and own ``less than 5 percent''
of the New York Yankees, started collecting baseball memorabilia
seriously again, though ``seriously'' can hardly describe it.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate baseball fanatic owns the Babe Ruth of baseball
collections, the biggest, strongest private baseball memorabilia
collection in the world. It takes up an entire floor of his
sprawling suburban contemporary here (plus two warehouses), makes
everyone who sees it 8 years old again and nearly runs his life.
</P>
<P>
   For while he can't resist negotiating for new acquisitions,
especially in this magical baseball season (he sent Mark McGwire an
offer to swap a Roger Maris Yankee uniform for the one McGwire
wears on the day he breaks Maris' homer record), for six years,
Halper has been trying to sell the entire collection, which he
values at $42 million, only to strike out.
</P>
<P>
   He has had extensive negotiations with Bridgeport, Conn., which
included a Barry Halper Museum in its revitalization plan. He has
talked (and talked) with Hoboken, whose leaders hoped that a museum
to compete with the National Baseball Hall of Fame would help the
city's quest to be acknowledged as the birthplace of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   He has tried making a deal with private real-estate investors in
New York who wanted to open a Baseball Cathedral in a converted
church. He has talked to both Atlantic City and Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting to be too much,'' Halper said the other day,
still recovering from spending the day before with the latest
prospective buyers, who don't want to be identified in the
newspaper. ``Every time there's a new proposal, all these people
have to come over again and again. I'm getting tired of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Deals have all fallen through for one reason or another, usually
money. Bridgeport had two architectural firms working on plans for
the Barry Halper Museum, which would have stood right off
Interstate 95. ``It's a glorious collection,'' said Michael
Freimuth, the city's director of planning and development. ``But in
the public sector, there's millions of priorities.'' In the end, he
said, Bridgeport couldn't raise $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   Hoboken offered Halper $14 million and a share of its museum's
proceeds. When it wanted to appraise the whole collection, that
task, Halper said, took Christie's auction house a year and three
months.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most natural place for the collection, the National
Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, N.Y., couldn't buy
it even if it could afford it. It can accept donations, but is not
allowed to buy or sell items. (``Halper does have a terrific
collection,'' said John Ralph, a spokesman. ``One day, we'd love to
have it.'')
</P>
<P>
   Halper donated a rare 1909 Honus Wagner baseball card to the
Hall of Fame _ one just like it has sold for more than $600,000 _
and often lends the museum pieces for display. But he is not
prepared to give away his hard-won 50-year investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people just have no appreciation for what this is
worth,'' he said, gesturing around the collection. ``I have to look
out for my family, too.''
</P>
<P>
   He is 58 and looks robust, broad-shouldered (he was a pitcher
for the University of Miami) with a full head of dark hair and an
open, unlined face. But his health has been declining for years. He
suffered a massive heart attack in 1994 and a stroke last year that
still knocks him off his feet. He says his wife and three grown
children are not interested in the burdens of the collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``In deference to my family _ not to say my kids wouldn't want a
few pieces _ I need to get rid of this,'' he said. ``God forbid I
die and my family is stuck with this and all the estate taxes. What
I really want is it to be sold for a museum. But if I have to
auction it, as a last resort, I will.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   His full-time assistant, Tom D'Alonzo, spends his days at a
computer terminal, cataloging each piece in preparation for a sale,
any sale. So far, this has taken nearly four years. The collection
has more than 100,000 pieces, including 30,000 baseball cards,
1,800 balls, 4,000 photos and 4,500 personal papers (like Mickey
Mantle's first minor-league check, for $36.94).
</P>
<P>
   To enter the Halper baseball sanctuary is like falling into a
kaleidoscope. It fills five rooms floor to ceiling with a dizzying
array of everything from ads to games to oddities. Halper has to
steady his guests by pointing out the individual pieces (like the
Babe Ruth fishing lure with the ballplayer's head as the lure).
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of my favorites,'' he said, removing a dark brown
baseball bat split in half from a perch on the wall of his office.
``This is Babe Ruth's last bat. I got it from Al Capone's grandson.
See how it's signed `To the boys of Chicago'? He wasn't talking
about ballplayers.''
</P>
<P>
   He opened a wood-paneled wall (``I always liked spy movies,'' he
said) to reveal a secret closet with 1,068 historically significant
uniforms (644 of them autographed) on a rotating rack. Another wall
opened to display his card collection, which includes two of the
rare Honus Wagners. Behind yet another wall is the ball supposedly
used in the first organized baseball game, in 1846 in Hoboken's
Elysian Fields.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out a mounted sword, inscribed to a ballplayer in
1864. ``Now, I look at that,'' he said, ``and I say, `How can I
ever part with it?' But if I can get it into a museum, a lot of
people can enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he said, picking up a baseball signed by pitchers who
have made 3,000 strikeouts, ``I've got this one ready for Roger
Clemens to sign, someday soon.''

TOURISM IN NEW YORK PUTS SOME BACK ON JOB 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Additional bylines follow individual items.) 
(lb) 
 By LESLIE EATON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For most New Yorkers, the tourists swarming Manhattan
are a source of mixed emotions: amusement, exasperation, even
pride. But for an increasing group of city residents, tourists are
the source of something much more concrete: jobs.
</P>
<P>
   And many of the jobs are the kind the city particularly needs,
jobs for less-skilled workers who might once have found work in
factories but have struggled, in recent years, to find any
employment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manufacturing used to be where unskilled people could get a
start on the rungs of the career ladder,'' said Marc Goloven, an
economist at Chase Manhattan Bank. ``But as manufacturing has
dwindled in the city, perhaps tourism is one industry that will
supplant it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jobs in tourism are always vulnerable to economic shifts in the
United States and abroad. The current economic turmoil in Asia and
Latin America could have an impact, for instance. But for now, the
city's tourism boom means jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how many jobs are dependent on tourism is unknown; the
most recent figures available from the New York Convention and
Visitors Bureau date from 1995, though officials there hope to have
more current data by next month. The outdated figure of 131,000
jobs would account for about 4.5 percent of all nongovernment
employment in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The actual number of tourism jobs is almost certainly much
higher. Employment in ``tourism-sensitive'' industries has
increased by about 8 percent since mid-1996 _ much faster than the
city's job growth rate of about 5 percent in the private sector.
Those tourism sectors have added about 33,500 jobs, for a total of
458,000, according to the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The number of workers in ``amusement and recreation services,''
which include everything from theaters to race tracks, has jumped
by almost 16 percent; employment at museums, botanical gardens,
zoos, bars and restaurants has increased at double-digit rates. The
number of hotel employees has grown by almost 8 percent in the two
years that ended in June.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of these jobs come from tourism; native New Yorkers eat
at restaurants, go to museums and attend Broadway shows (except,
perhaps, ``Cats''). But tourism is giving these businesses a push,
said John Wieting, the regional commissioner for the bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the number of tourists visiting the city has soared.
Last year, more than 33 million people came to play, an increase of
more than 13 percent, and they spent $13.7 billion; the city
estimates that with all its ripple effects, tourism added $18
billion to the local economy.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the numbers are continuing to grow, although at a
slower pace; the Visitors Bureau forecasts that 34 million tourists
will spent a total of $14.3 billion, an estimate that city
officials describe as conservative.
</P>
<P>
   By no means are all of the workers catering to these visitors
unskilled, said Fran Reiter, the president of the agency, which is
responsible for marketing the city to tourists. ``The industry
provides jobs at every level,'' she said, noting that the hotel
business has increasingly needed computer workers, and that running
entertainment and travel businesses requires a lot of management
expertise.
</P>
<P>
   But, Ms. Reiter acknowledged, tourism also provides many
entry-level jobs for people without much work experience.
</P>
<P>
   Many tourism-related jobs, accordingly, do not pay very well.
The average salary at hotels last year was about $32,900 a year,
and the average worker at a bar or restaurant made less than
$17,000 in salary, according to the New York state comptroller's
office. The average worker in the city made $48,800.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in tourism is probably helping to push up the
earnings of all less-skilled workers, because demand for such labor
is increasing, said Alan Krueger, a economist who teaches at
Princeton University.
</P>
<P>
   And though tourism tends to rise and fall based on economic
conditions, the long-term trend is strong, Krueger said. ``As the
rest of the world, with hiccups, becomes wealthier,'' foreigners
will become more likely to take vacations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers whose jobs are not dependent on tourism are not all
delighted to see their city ranked with Orlando, Fla., and Las
Vegas as a destination. Ms. Reiter hears complaints about
everything from crowded sidewalks to Peeping Toms on the
double-decker buses. But she is not sympathetic to complaints about
tourists. ``They spend $18 billion,'' she said. ``Give me a
break.''

   Tour Facilitator

<P>
   An `Easy Job' on the Streets
</P>
<P>
   Silvio Acosta has what is by all accounts a dead-end job: He
sells sightseeing trips to the tourists who descend on New York
each day.
</P>
<P>
   But considering the way business has soared in the two years
since he took the job, Acosta would gladly take a dozen more like
it. Wherever he stops his mobile office, an aging blue
double-decker bus that also wears a rather large ad for Continental
Airlines, swarms of vacationers flock with questions and cameras.
Thanks to them, Acosta's pockets have never been fatter, nor his
future more stable.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best job I've ever had,'' the 27-year-old declared
one recent afternoon, as he scouted for customers at Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for the tickets he sells is so hot that his employer, New
York Double Decker Tours, plans over the next year to add another
125 street-based agents to its current team of 75.
</P>
<P>
   ``After years of being notorious, New York is the place to be
again,'' boasts Alexander Garzon, Double Decker's chief executive.
``Everybody is benefiting.'' The company, whose tours cost from $20
to $35, also intends to expand its fleet of 20 buses next year with
30 new buses.
</P>
<P>
   For Acosta, the company's good times have afforded him a ticket
to a better life. He earns $5 for every ticket he sells, which on
most weeks brings him about $700, more than double the $300 a week
he had been making working various restaurant jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Acosta said he never thought he could ``make a living so easy in
this city.'' He added, ``Now I feel able to relax.''
</P>
<P>
   When Acosta moved from Santiago in the Dominican Republican
seven years ago, all he had was a semester of college and a desire
to see the city that had captured the imaginations of so many of
his friends back home. He found work in the usual refuge for new
arrivals, restaurants, where he bused tables and washed dishes. He
later worked at a midtown McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to ease his way out of the fast-food industry, Acosta
applied for what he had intended to be only a transitional job. But
the money has been better than even he expected, although he
receives no benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``People, they think we don't earn so much being out here _ but
let me show you something,'' he said snatching a copy of his most
recent pay stub from his pouch. Proudly pointing out his bounty for
the week, $675, he continued, ``This is a good, easy job, no?''
</P>
<P>
   Still beaming, Acosta cuts himself off to make his pitch to a
couple from Ohio who have walked up to the bus for more
information. It is shortly after noon and he is still more than
$100 away from his goal of $200 in commissions today.
</P>
<P>
   He looks the couple over, turns up his smile and says, ``We have
the best prices and best seats in New York.'' But the pitch fails.
The woman notices the sprawling Virgin record store across street
and drags her companion off.
</P>
<P>
   But Acosta is unfazed. ``All I have to do,'' he says, ``is to
stand here and be friendly. The people will come. This is why they
come here.''

   Hotel Housekeeper
</P>
<P>
   Pampering Guests at $15.57 an Hour
</P>
<P>
   For eight years, Violeta McZeno worked as a receptionist at a
dental office in downtown Manhattan. She liked her job and made
what she thought then was a good salary, $8 an hour. Then two
things happened: Ms. McZeno separated from her husband, and she
lost her job when the dentists moved.
</P>
<P>
   In nine months without a job or a husband to help her pay the
rent, Ms. McZeno, 52, went through her nest egg _ about $10,000 _
and borrowed money from her sister and a friend. Just as Ms. McZeno
was reaching the end of her rope, though, the tourism boom hit New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the Pierre, a 68-year-old landmark hotel on Fifth Avenue
and 61st Street, where a room costs a minimum of $440 a night for a
single occupancy and where Japanese guests are pampered with soft
cotton kimonos and plush terry slippers. A friend of Ms. McZeno,
who worked as a housekeeper there, told her jobs were available and
suggested she apply.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McZeno, who had never worked as a housekeeper and had never
searched for a job in the service industry, followed her friend's
advice and got a full-time job less than a week after she applied.
She started making $11 an hour and now, two years later, she is
making $15.57 an hour. She gets two weeks of vacation and full
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't be happier,'' she said. ``I was lucky, what can I
say?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McZeno benefited from the hotel's policy of hiring people
with good attitudes, regardless of their hotel experience, said
Mary Jo McNally, director of public relations at the Pierre. But
Ms. McZeno was also fortunate because she went looking for a job
just when the hotel needed extra workers to cope with the
increasing number of tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were definitely hiring more people then because our
business was so much stronger,'' Ms. McNally said.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, she added, the hotel has hired 16
housekeepers to complement a staff of 650 employees. This year, the
Pierre's executives have projected an 85 percent occupancy rate,
Ms. McNally said. ``In the '80s, we were lucky if we reached 70
percent some years,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McZeno's days are long and difficult. She begins at 8:30
a.m. and by 5 p.m. has cleaned 15 rooms, paying attention to the
details required by Four Seasons Hotels, the company that runs the
Pierre. The towels have to be folded just so, the fluffy bathrobes
have to hang behind the door of the bathroom and the flowers have
to be fresh.
</P>
<P>
   But her efforts are rewarded, she says. Her salary has been
raised twice and most of her guests leave tips that range anywhere
from $1 a day to $30 at the end of a brief stay.
</P>
<P>
   With the money she has earned so far, Ms. McZeno was able to pay
her debts, buy a set of gold bracelets she had always wanted, and
travel to Mexico, Las Vegas and California. She also moved with her
two daughters, now 19 and 26, to a bigger, more expensive apartment
in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McZeno, who was born in Panama but has lived in the United
States since 1989, says she never imagined that cleaning other
people's rooms and attending to their every need would pay her more
than she ever made working as a secretary, the career she studied
and trained for back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pay my bills and rest easy at night,'' she said. ``Who could
ask for more?''

   Couture Saleswoman at Versace
</P>
<P>
   Service Comes in Spanish
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in the Dominican Republic, Veronica Valerio did not
dream big fashion dreams. No one she knew wore designer clothes,
and her knowledge of celebrities, and their proclivity for
borrowing fancy gowns, was the stuff of glossy magazines.
</P>
<P>
   She moved to New York with her parents when she was 15, and
quickly went to work to help support life in their apartment
overlooking Yankee Stadium. ``Work was a necessity,'' she said,
leaning back into a rococo-style chaise longue in the Versace
atelier on Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 she saw a help-wanted ad for a cashier. She was already
working as one at a pizzeria on 42nd Street, so she knew she could
do the job. ``All I knew is that it was a clothing store,'' she
said. She was thrilled to realize that she would be ringing up
sales of Versace jeans and glittery tops.
</P>
<P>
   Her sales skills and knowledge of Spanish would later combine to
vault her to an assistant-manager position. When she walks through
her old neighborhood now, she wears a slim black Versace suit made
for her. ``They say, `Here comes the Versace girl,''' she said with
a grin.
</P>
<P>
   Her language skills are essential to the five-story store on
Fifth Avenue near 52nd Street, where roughly half the purchases are
made by South American tourists. Indeed, tourists account for far
more sales on Fifth Avenue than on any other upscale strip in
Manhattan, retail experts say, and that makes language skills a big
plus among those who work there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tourists love to make trophy purchases on Fifth Avenue,'' said
Markus Evner, a Versace spokesman. ``If an associate can speak a
language, that is important.''
</P>
<P>
   Saks Fifth Avenue has a special service for foreign shoppers
that matches them with personal shoppers, and the concierge at
Barneys New York keeps a list of which employees speak what
language.
</P>
<P>
   Clerks who know something about fashion and can talk about it in
Japanese, Russian and French are so valued that many stores do not
even want to discuss them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is after good sales associates with language
skills,'' said Robert Triefus, a spokesman for Calvin Klein, who
has a store on Madison Avenue. And, consequently, he did not want a
reporter meeting any at his store. ``The high-end stores and the
staff that are in them are a precious commodity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Valerio, 29, was promoted to the sales floor in 1997 and
quickly started to help the richest of the rich. There was the
architect from Puerto Rico who came in for a tie and walked out
with $97,000 in jewelry for his wife. ``It's always nice to see
him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She has helped Madonna pick out a dress to borrow, as well as
the socialite Julia Koch, who was so impressed with her that she
called the publicity office the next day to compliment her, and
sent a gift.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are people like the family from Spain who were
browsing the sportswear floor the other day. Like the majority of
shoppers who come in to gawk at the glittering, barely-there gowns
or just to see the house built by the designer whose murder became
a subject of public discourse, they would almost surely buy
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   She greeted them warmly, and in Spanish, as if they had just
dropped by for lunch. ``Your first time here,'' she asked.
``Welcome!'' Some of these exchanges end up being her favorites.
``When I learn where a customer is from, we exchange a bit of
stories,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She still walks by that pizzeria on 42nd Street from time to
time. ``I think to myself, `Oh God,'' she said. ``It's like a
Cinderella story.''

   Art Consultant
</P>
<P>
   Guiding Appreciators of Contemporary Art
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, Todd Weissner's financial landscape was as
barren as Wall Street on a Sunday. He had spent the last nine
months as a gofer for various executives around the city, making
calls, typing and filing letters and fetching coffee. He had gone
for months without health or dental benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Out of desperation, he applied for a job as an art consultant at
Martin Lawrence Galleries in SoHo. He landed it, and now sells art
for one of the largest dealers of pop art in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Bless the booming tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
   The galleries, deluged by tourists this summer, began increasing
their staff of six in June, said Nancy Retchin-Rich, director of
the galleries on West Broadway, which cuts through the heart of
SoHo. She hired Weissner full time three weeks ago, even though
business for art galleries generally trails off in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may not have been looking for additional people had business
not been so good, had I not seen the need, had there not been so
many bodies walking in the door that I saw needing to be attended
to,'' said Ms. Retchin-Rich, who has worked as director for a year
and at the galleries for eight years. ``Most of our sales are to
tourists.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Weissner, 24, he had no idea that tourism would ever have
such a direct impact on his life. A painter himself, he is glad to
have finally landed a job in an area related to one of his
passions.
</P>
<P>
   A poised and spindly man dressed in a dark shirt and tie,
Weissner guides clients around various original paintings and
prints by Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and Keith Haring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market's real thin right now in Europe,'' Weissner said.
``So a lot of people who come in think we are a museum. They see so
much work that they don't actually realize we are selling it,
especially with the pop art.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Weissner's second full-time job since graduating two
years ago from Rutgers University with a bachelor's degree in fine
arts. He lasted exactly two months at his first job at a studio in
the East Village, he said, because the pay was too low.
</P>
<P>
   He pays just under $700 for space in a sprawling top-floor loft
apartment in Brooklyn that he shares with two other people, a
musician and an entrepreneur. He also has studio space in the loft,
where he can paint.
</P>
<P>
   When, after a time working at a temporary employment agency, he
learned through a newspaper ad that that Martin Lawrence was
looking for a consultant, he couldn't believe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I got the job, because I am passionate about art,''
he said. ``I was really interested in working at Martin Lawrence so
I could meet collectors and other people who love art, not just
those who buy it to decorate walls. I've found that here.''

<P>
   Outdoor Food Vendor
</P>
<P>
   A Chance to Try Out High School French
</P>
<P>
   When Charlene Watson went back to work after 18 months of making
do on unemployment insurance and then welfare, she did not expect
the job benefits would include learning how to count in German and
practicing her rusty high school French.
</P>
<P>
   But as an assistant manager of the outdoor food stand at Pier 83
on the Hudson River at 42nd Street, where the Circle Line
sightseeing tour boats dock, Ms. Watson gets a little ``frisson''
of excitement from dealing with the foreign tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having fun doing this,'' she said, all the while keeping
an eye on the slowly cooking hot dogs that have now become her
stock in trade. ``If I didn't have this, I would be solely
dependent on public assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, doling out dogs and helping strangers make sense of
American money was not Ms. Watson's idea of a dream job. She had
been working as a bookkeeper and secretary, but those weren't the
kinds of jobs being offered.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Watson, 41, was hired in April by Eurest Dining Services,
which runs the food concession for Circle Line and Seaport Liberty
Cruises. At that time, many people in the tourism industry,
including the sightseeing and food companies, were anticipating a
boom summer.
</P>
<P>
   Eurest, for example, hired 50 people in the spring for its
tourism-related contracts.
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, the expected boom has not materialized. Donald
Fairbanks, general manager of the cruise company, said that after a
spectacular spring, ticket sales now are at the same level as last
summer, even with three extra evening tours. ``We had anticipated
growth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, those early great expectations helped Ms. Watson,
who lives in the Bronx, rejoin the work force.
</P>
<P>
   She said she had worked for 13 years for Aramark Corp., another
food-service company, at its dining halls at New York University.
She started as a weekend deli person and worked her way up to
office jobs before being laid off in a company-wide ``downsizing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the downsizing was coming,'' Ms. Watson said. ``I just
didn't think I would get caught up in it.''
</P>
<P>
   She had three children at the time _ 18, 17 and 13 years old _
still at home. When the unemployment checks stopped after six
months, she went on public assistance, getting a check for $149
every two weeks and $250 worth of food stamps each month.
</P>
<P>
   Through America Works, a private company that helps welfare
recipients to prepare resumes and to interview for jobs, she tried
to get another office job. But Ms. Watson said her background in
food services was what finally led to a paycheck. It was like
starting from scratch: Her new job was preparing salads for the
same food-services contractor, Aramark, where she had worked so
many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 13 years of experience down the drain,'' Ms. Watson
said.
</P>
<P>
   When the Aramark job ended after three months, she was again
unemployed. The Grand Street Settlement House, which also helps
applicants polish their job-hunting skills, sent her to Eurest.
After a training course serving food on one of the Circle Line
tours _ Ms. Watson's first trip on the sightseeing boat _ she was
assigned to the food stand outside the ticket office.
</P>
<P>
   Many of her customers are from Europe. They add a little flavor
to her eight-hour day behind the grill. ``I had one customer from
France, I guess, and I said hello to her in French and then she was
off,'' Ms. Watson recalled. ``She started talking and talking in
French and I was just trying to remember it from high school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just kept saying `uh-huh' and `hmmm' and nodding,'' she
added. ``Then at the end the lady said to me, in perfect English,
`Have a nice day.'''

 RAFTER ADVANCES TO HAMLET CUP FINALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By RON DICKER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COMMACK, N.Y. _ Patrick Rafter of Australia increased his career
record to 5-1 over Greg Rusedski of England with a 6-4, 7-5 victory
Saturday in a semifinal of the Hamlet Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The second-seeded Rafter advanced to the final Sunday for the
second consecutive year. He will face the winner of the Marat
Safin-Felix Mantilla match, scheduled for Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter, his lower left leg mummified with tape because of a
tender Achilles tendon, did not surrender a service break. He did
not bully the radar gun as Rusedski did at times, but Rafter's
serve was as effective. He kept Rusedski off balance with an array
of speeds and placements. Rusedski had nine aces and Rafter seven
in the 80-minute match.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter, the hottest player on the tour at the moment, has won 25
of his last 28 matches, with one to play, before entering the U.S.
Open, which begins on Monday. On Saturday, his face streaked with
white zinc ointment to protect him from the sun, Rafter zipped a
backhand passing shot to reach break point in the second game of
the match. Then the fourth-seeded Rusedski double-faulted to hand
him the game. Rafter made the advantage stick. He closed out the
first set with a service winner after Rusedski had ripped aces of
136 and 135 mph in the previous game.
</P>
<P>
   Rusedski threatened to break Rafter's serve when leading 2-1 in
the second set. He had Rafter down 15-40, but the Australian jammed
Rusedski with a kick serve and unloaded an ace to bring the game
back to deuce. He eventually captured the game.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter's next break came in the 11th game of the second set.
With the set tied at 5-5, Rusedski poked a half-volley into the net
to set up a break point. Rafter fired a forehand winner on a
service return to take a 6-5 lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the next game, Rafter fought off a break point against him
when Rusedski sent a backhand beyond the baseline. Rusedski then
hit a backhand volley long, and slapped a backhand into the net to
end the match. It was the first time in four ATP Tour encounters
that the two failed to go to a third and deciding set.
</P>
<P>
   Rusedski said beforehand that he was using the Rafter match to
measure his progress in coming back from an ankle tendon tear he
sustained seven weeks ago. Rafter said he was not concerned with
the result.

NEW YORK, HOLDING BOMB SUSPECTS, TIGHTENS SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the Yankees limbered up for their game against the
Seattle Mariners Saturday afternoon, edging toward their 100th win
this year, 55,000 fans walked through a labyrinth of uniformed
officers who searched their bags and studied their faces for signs
of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   In Flushing Meadows, Queens, 33,000 tennis fans entering the
U.S. Open on Saturday for Arthur Ashe Day also had their bags
checked, while at Kennedy International Airport, travelers were
greeted by beefed-up police patrols and bomb-sniffing dogs that
investigated unattended package and cars.
</P>
<P>
   These were some of the latest moves to tighten security around
possible terrorist targets in New York City, where two suspects in
the Aug. 7 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, are being
detained. The measures were begun shortly after the bombing, but
ratcheted up quickly with the news that the suspects would be
facing trial here.
</P>
<P>
   What began with identification checks and barriers of red-velvet
ropes stretching out of the entrances to important city buildings,
like the Police Headquarters at 1 Police Plaza, quickly took on the
appearance of large-scale construction.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic has been backed up or rerouted on several streets in
lower Manhattan over the last three days, as trucks brought in huge
concrete barriers to be erected around police headquarters, federal
buildings and City Hall. Parts of Pearl Street, which leads to the
federal court and the Metropolitan Correction Center, have been
closed from Madison Street to Park Row, with police officers posted
on the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   Garbage bins in the area have been locked shut, while
bomb-sniffing dogs have sometimes been seen walking the street near
the detention center, which holds Mohamed Rashed Daoud 'Owhali and
Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, the two suspects in the Nairobi bombing that
killed at least 247 people, including 12 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Barriers were also being installed at the Metro-Tech Center in
Brooklyn, which houses the Fire Department headquarters and the
city's 911 emergency system, said a fire official who spoke on
condition of anonymity. He added that a wooden barrier erected to
stop cars from entering a parking garage in the center had been
replaced days ago with a sheet of steel mesh that has to be raised
before cars are allowed inside and that guards were checking
credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Mode, a Police Department spokeswoman, said that other
precautions, including more street closings, may be taken. But she
added that the barricades and other security measures were not
being taken because of any known terrorism threat.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Dempsey, a spokesman for the U.S. Marshals Service, said
that his people ``have been on alert status with all the activity
going on in New York, and we are taking any and all necessary
precautions to assure the security of the judiciary.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the latest precautions are at the city's airports and
sporting events. One Port Authority police officer at Kennedy
Airport, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the number
of officers patrolling the city's airports had been increased to
levels comparable to those in the Persian Gulf war, with about
one-third more officers being assigned to watch for suspicious
activity and answer calls about unattended packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting a lot more calls right now, to unattended bags
and cars,'' he said. ``There's a lot more private security both
inside and outside the terminals, and instead of a left bag being
routine, people are now calling them in. They don't want to take
chances anymore.''

GIULIANI VOWS MORE CLOSINGS OF SEX SHOPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Despite a court ruling enabling several city sex
shops to continue offering their racy wares, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
vowed Saturday to continue his crusade against adult emporiums and
set a new goal: shuttering two dozen more by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Stephen Crane of state Supreme Court in Manhattan ruled
on Friday that Show World, the city's best-known peep hall, could
continue offering sex toys and other adult goods as long as the
merchandise takes up no more than 40 percent of the store's space.
</P>
<P>
   Crane's opinion said that Show World, in midtown Manhattan, and
two other adult video stores in Manhattan had made enough changes
in their merchandise to comply with a new zoning law intended to
make most X-rated businesses close or move to areas of New York
City with little foot traffic. Although lawyers for sex shops and
clubs hailed the ruling as preserving their clients' industry,
Giuliani said the ruling should not stop his effort to break up
strips of adult businesses and force them into a few industrial
areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``One case doesn't mean anything,'' Giuliani said. ``We never
promised, nor could we, that we would get rid of all sex shops in
the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Steven Fishner, the mayor's criminal justice
coordinator, said the city would not automatically accept the 40
percent standard in the case of other adult businesses. He said the
city would take each one to court if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we will be looking at is what is actually going on,'' he
said. ``They can add billiard tables and show wrestling movies, but
if they are in fact an adult establishment, we're going to be
arguing to judges that they should look behind that.''
</P>
<P>
   Herald Price Fahringer, the lawyer for Show World and 106 other
adult businesses, said it would be irresponsible for the city not
to accept the judge's standard for other businesses. Fahringer said
the mayor and city officials were ``disturbed because stores are
complying.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They really want to get rid of them, and they can't do that
under the Constitution,'' he said. ``They didn't think anyone would
be able to comply. Now they want to change the rules.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Fahringer said the ruling was clear: if businesses comply with
the guidelines established by the city, they will not be closed.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Giuliani, who took credit for forcing the owners of
Show World to turn 60 percent of their space over to goods like
sodas, souvenirs and cellular phones, said city officials would
continue to watch the business. ``They're going to have to comply
forever and ever,'' he said. ``They make one mistake, and they get
closed.''
</P>
<P>
   The dilution of the adult entertainment industry has been a
longtime goal of what Giuliani calls his quality-of-life campaign.
But he was not able to go ahead with it until July, when the U.S.
Supreme Court said it would not stop the city from enforcing the
new zoning law.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's office said Saturday that of the 144 adult bars,
bookstores and theaters operating in the city in July, 21 had
voluntarily closed, 11 had been temporarily closed by court action,
two had been permanently closed by court action and six had
transformed themselves into other types of businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said the figures showed his campaign was already
succeeding. ``By the time we get to Christmastime, it'll be below
100,'' he said. ``We're probably going to exceed the target that I
set of six months in getting the industry under much better control
and regulation. We're probably going to be there in four months
rather than six.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor made his comments about the ruling during a news
conference he held in the Bronx Saturday, after dedicating a park
and playground at the Hillside Homes. Once ridden with drug-dealing
and prostitution, the complex has been cleaned up and renamed
Eastchester Heights.
</P>
<P>
   The park was dedicated to Sean Carrington, a narcotics detective
who grew up at Hillside and was shot to death on Jan. 19 during an
undercover drug buy. Parents were urged to show their children the
memorial plaque. It says of Carrington: ``He gave that others might
live.''

FEW IN WASHINGTON ARE REALLY `DOING THE WORK OF THE PEOPLE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: There is a troubling subliminal message in President
Clinton's contention that Americans need to put the distractions of
his scandalous conduct behind them so he can devote his full
energies to running the country.
</P>
<P>
   In White House spin circles it's sometimes characterized as
``doing the work of the people.'' The implication is that most of
us couldn't get along without the important people in Washington
laboring diligently in our behalf.
</P>
<P>
   The people, however, can do their own work, thank you. And if
they're counting on Washington's exalted Pooh-Bahs to do it for
them, they shouldn't hold their breath waiting for the completion
of any productive endeavor that creates wealth.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, few, if any, of Washington's elected grandees really
do the people's work. Not the president, and not the members of
Congress. They, with the help of their minions and the bureaucracy,
operate an enterprise devoted almost entirely to expanding its
scope and power, thus preserving the jobs of all involved.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to believe, but as recently as 35 to 40 years ago
Washington's relevance to the daily life of most Americans was
minimal. A humorous staple featured someone at the door
proclaiming, ``I'm from government and I'm here to help you.'' It
was always good for a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that there are significant numbers of Americans who
really do believe Washington does important business for them owes
its validity to one unfortunate development over the past few
decades. Four of 10 Americans have become net recipients of
government largess, according to calculations made by Stanford
economist Michael Boskin, who headed President George Bush's
Council of Economic Advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these people have the same relationship to our lords
in Washington and other seats of government that a household pet
has to its keeper,'' Karl Zinsmeister noted in a recent article in
The American Enterprise magazine. ``Boskin calculates that this
recipiency ratio will reach 50 percent over the next couple of
decades. Then we'll literally have one half of our populace
underwriting the other half.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the important work being done in Washington. It's called
income redistribution, and it helps explain why so many otherwise
discerning people are willing to overlook the more objectionable
aspects of Clinton's personal conduct. If the routine at
Washington's highest levels is disturbed, what happens? Who's to
say it won't disrupt the flow of largess to the 40 percent of the
population depending on Washington for a critical portion of its
livelihood?
</P>
<P>
   The real work of America is done by individual Americans trying
to make a living and doing the best they can for themselves and
their families. They make things, sell things, provide services,
perform civic duties. Everyone counts on everyone else for
something, whether he or she realizes it or not. Not only do those
who do the work depend on one another, those who don't work also
depend on those who do work.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is the big abstract. Its only practical relevance for
those who do productive work is how much government will shortstop
from the paychecks of those who do the work.
</P>
<P>
   Do you know what the most demanding job is for many of your
elected leaders in Washington? Raising money to get re-elected.
It's hard work, to be sure, but it's more in the nature of service
to self than service to the public.

REAL ESTATE COMPANY BEING BOUGHT BY IOWA UTILITY HOLDING COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIUS A. KARASH  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OVERLAND PARK, Kan. _ J.C. Nichols Real Estate announced that it
was being bought by MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co., a utility
holding company based in Des Moines, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase, expected to close next week, marks the latest in a
series of real estate industry consolidations. It will leave the
Kansas City area with only one large, independent, locally owned
residential brokerage, J.D. Reece Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols Real Estate will be MidAmerican's seventh acquisition of
a large residential brokerage organization in three months.
</P>
<P>
   MidAmerican is snapping up real estate firms to line up new
utility customers. Consumer advocates say residential utility
customers can get cheaper and better service if they could choose
their own providers. Industry observers expect utility deregulation
to make this the norm someday.
</P>
<P>
   MidAmerican envisions that the Nichols sales representatives
will introduce homebuyers to MidAmerican sales representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols Real Estate is based in Overland Park and is one of the
biggest residential real estate firms in the Kansas City area. Last
May, it bought Eugene D. Brown Realtors, another big, locally owned
firm.
</P>
<P>
   Formed in 1990, Nichols Real Estate currently is 60 percent
owned by real estate executives Jack Frost, Larry Wallace and David
Cooper. It is 40 percent owned by the J.C. Nichols Co., which now
is a subsidiary of Highwoods Properties Inc. of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Under the transaction announced Thursday, the company will be
owned 100 percent by MidAmerican and will be renamed J.C. Nichols
Residential.
</P>
<P>
   Financial details of the transaction were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Frost said the firm's current management, sales agents and
employees would remain. Frost will continue as president and chief
executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look forward to this innovative and visionary partnership
with MidAmerican Energy,'' Frost said.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley J. Bright, MidAmerican's chairman, president and chief
executive officer, said the deal ``greatly broadens MidAmerican's
commitment to the residential real estate channel and brings us
closer to our goal of becoming the leading regional provider of
energy and related services.''
</P>
<P>
   Nichols Real Estate has 680 sales agents and 80 employees in 17
Kansas City area offices. In addition, about 160 sales agents work
out of 18 franchised, independently owned offices that make up the
J.C. Nichols Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Overland Park-based J.D. Reece has 1,200 sales agents.
</P>
<P>
   Like players in other industries, real estate companies have
been merging for about the last 10 years to attain greater market
share, economies of scale and data-processing capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Reece, president and chief executive officer of J.D.
Reece, said it was a ``downer for the city'' that Nichols Real
Estate no longer would be locally owned.
</P>
<P>
   But Reece said he wanted to congratulate Frost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Real estate companies are selling for historically high prices
right now,'' he said. I'm sure he made an excellent deal here.''
</P>
<P>
   Frost acknowledged the loss of local ownership, but emphasized
that J.C. Nichols Residential would be locally managed.
</P>
<P>
   In a news release, Bright said real estate agents would continue
to focus on home sales ``and will not sell MidAmerican products and
services. In the future, at the appropriate point in the homebuying
process, the agent will introduce the customer to a MidAmerican
sales representative.''
</P>
<P>
   MidAmerican is a publicly traded company and is listed on the
New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol MEC. It serves
electric and natural gas customers in several states and offers
home security, appliance warranty and utility home-connection
services in some markets.

   DETROIT _ Far from causing chaos, Saturday's strike by the
Northwest Airlines pilots brought a rare calm to airports dominated
by the carrier, as many travelers found seats on other airlines or
simply accepted delays with Midwestern stoicism.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest's hub airports here and in Memphis, Tenn., and
Minneapolis had prepared to handle thousands of stranded passengers
but wound up with few people to help. Memphis International
Airport, for example, did not have to use any of the 2,000
mattresses ready for stranded passengers. Northwest booked 200
hotel rooms in Detroit for passengers who might miss connections
when the strike began at 12:01 a.m., but used only 22 of them, said
Robert Ball, Northwest's vice president for Detroit customer
service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can use 500 rooms on a bad weather night,'' Ball said,
adding that while the strike stranded some passengers, ``They may
have been stranded at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Rival airlines had plenty of clerks, and even their lines were
not especially long at Northwest's hubs.
</P>
<P>
   Rachael Shapiro, a 17-year-old flying from Memphis to Boston for
her first day at the Berklee College of Music, switched from
Northwest to Delta Air Lines with less difficulty than she
expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night, the news had a clock in the corner of the screen
counting the minutes until the strike deadline, and they called it
`countdown to chaos,''' Ms. Shapiro said, standing at the airport
with her family and four green duffel bags. ``But really it is
pretty calm this morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Other travelers were more upset. Kathi Harris, a 47-year-old
nurse from Plymouth, Mich., said Northwest Airlines' toll-free
number was constantly busy on Friday night. But she called America
West, which immediately accepted her ticket for travel Saturday to
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in a short line to check in with America West on
Saturday morning in Detroit, Mrs. Harris said that travelers were
suffering the most from the strike. ``This is terrible, isn't it?''
she said. ``The public always suffers.''
</P>
<P>
   There seemed to be less confusion than expected Saturday for
several reasons. Earlier this week, Northwest canceled many flights
scheduled for Friday night and Saturday, so few passengers were
stranded while trying to make connections.
</P>
<P>
   While Northwest handled 75 to 80 percent of the passengers in
Detroit, Minneapolis and Memphis, many of them were making
connections and could fly through other cities. In Detroit, for
example, Northwest and its commuter affiliates carry 76 percent of
all travelers, but only 45 percent of those beginning or ending
their trip in Detroit, said Michael Conway, a spokesman for the
Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest also sold fewer tickets than usual for this weekend
because travelers, fearing a strike, avoided the carrier. Northwest
handled only 29,000 passengers Saturday beginning or ending their
journeys in Michigan, instead of the usual 40,000, Ball said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Smith, a 24-year-old Detroit auto engineer, and his
wife, Jessica, avoided Northwest for their flight Saturday to his
new job assignment in Shanghai. On the advice of his travel agent,
he booked his trip on United Airlines, even though that will
require him to take two more connecting flights.
</P>
<P>
   Smith expressed surprise that United did not seem especially
busy at Detroit's airport Saturday morning. ``It's not as crazy as
I thought,'' he said. ``I expected to pull up and see chaos.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   New York area airports, where there are more competing airlines
than at Northwest's Midwestern hubs, were also quiet. At Kennedy
International Airport, Eric Schneider, 23, of Brooklyn, who was on
leave from the Navy, was forced to change flights from Northwest to
Japan Airlines to return to his ship in Japan. Although he will get
back a day late, he said, ``it's not like it's the end of the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Travelers in cities with few alternatives to Northwest were
inconvenienced the most, but these tended to be smaller communities
whose residents bore their problems calmly. In Fargo, N.D., where
the only competition to Northwest is an occasional United Express
flight that is booked solid until Sept. 9, only four of 26
passengers even bothered to show up for Northwest Flight 3243
Saturday morning to Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Some travelers, particularly those who used travel agents, said
they had little difficulty in switching to other carriers. Muriel
F. Prince, a 77-year-old retired small business owner from
Kingsville, Ontario, said her travel agent, the Canadian Automobile
Association, had booked her a separate ticket on Friday on American
Airlines from Detroit to San Diego, where she planned to visit her
daughter. Mrs. Prince said that she was counting on an eventual
refund for her Northwest ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Some travelers tried to rent cars to reach nearby destinations,
and rental agencies quickly ran short of some models. Francisco
Perez and Everton Collins, computer consultants from Miami, called
four rental agencies before renting a Chevrolet Malibu for the
drive to Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said he and Perez had watched accounts of the strike on
television on Friday night and had not worried about it, because
they had flown American Airlines to Detroit and assumed that their
flight to Cleveland would be on American.
</P>
<P>
   But when they arrived at the airport, the consultants found that
the tickets inside their American Airlines ticket jackets were for
Northwest to Cleveland. With no seats available on flights to
Cleveland, the two took their coming drive in stride.
</P>
<P>
   As frequent business travelers, Perez said, ``We can't take
anything too seriously.''

TANNING SALON OWNER CHARGED WITH SECRETLY VIDEOTAPING WOMEN
CUSTOMERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LENEXA, Kan. _ A Lenexa tanning salon owner was charged with
secretly videotaping 13 women while they tanned nude, and police
were trying to find out how many other victims there might be.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Wallace Emmons of Lenexa, who owns Sun Swim USA, did not
enter a plea Friday after hearing the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to talk to an attorney,'' said Emmons, 32. A judge
entered a not-guilty plea for him. Bond was set at $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Emmons was arrested Thursday after a salon manager, looking for
the source of a leak, went into Emmons' office, which was always
locked. She became suspicious when she found videotapes and a
ladder that led to a false vent, police said. She played one of the
tapes, which showed women tanning, and called police.
</P>
<P>
   The manager was one of the victims, and she identified 12 other
women on the tapes. Police had not talked to them on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Officers found four tapes at the business and then searched the
man's home. By Friday afternoon, they had collected 40 to 50 tapes
that detectives wanted to go through, said Lenexa Police Detective
Sarah Vogelsberg.
</P>
<P>
   In the salon, detectives found that a restroom and tanning
booths No. 3 and No. 4 had been set up for someone to watch
unsuspecting tanners.
</P>
<P>
   One booth had a false vent over a hole in the wall. On the other
side of the wall, in the owner's office, the hole was covered with
black mesh. Anyone who lifted the mesh far enough to peer through
had a full view of the room with the help of strategically placed
mirrors, Vogelsberg said.
</P>
<P>
   No one answered the phone at the business Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Emmons has owned the Sun Swim USA since January, police said. In
March, he remodeled the business, installing plasterboard in his
office to close a gap between the top of the wall and the ceiling,
the manager told police.
</P>
<P>
   Vogelsberg and another female detective hope to finish watching
the videotapes in two weeks. They will pause the tapes to make a
photo as each victim enters the booth clothed. First the manager
will try to identify the women, and then detectives will let
potential victims look at photos. Detectives also seized an
appointment book that goes back to April 15.
</P>
<P>
   About 120 people called Vogelsberg on Friday, but she was able
to talk to only about 25 of them. She hopes to return the calls
within two weeks.

GOLFER TOM WATSON JOINS BID TO BUY KANSAS CITY ROYALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES R.T. CRUMPLEY  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Golfer Tom Watson has joined the group led by
Miles Prentice _ who has knit together a diverse collection of
big-name Kansas Citians that is close to buying the Kansas City
Royals.
</P>
<P>
   Watson said Friday afternoon that he was motivated to help save
the baseball team for Kansas City, and that he was sold by
Prentice's enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I like about Miles is that he loves baseball,'' Watson
said at an afternoon press conference. ``He has enthusiasm that I
know is going to work here in Kansas City as far as getting people
involved in the game...getting kids involved, getting families
involved in the Royals. That's very apparent to me. I think that's
very apparent to people who've met him and sat down and talked with
him about his vision for the Royals in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I'm here today,'' said Watson, a native of the
Kansas City area. ``I want to see the Royals stay in Kansas City.
And I want to be a part of the team. I will be part of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the last reason is, it's a heck of lot easier signing
baseballs than it is those golf balls.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson would not say how much money he's investing with the
Prentice group. Prentice lately has requested minimum investments
of $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Watson, who will turn 49 next week, said he has been to Kauffman
Stadium about a half dozen times this year. ``There's nothing
better to me than listening to baseball on radio or going out to
the park and watch a ball game.''
</P>
<P>
   Prentice is a New Yorker and minor-league team owner who turned
56 on Thursday. He's been striving for three months to assemble so
many Kansas City investors that local money will make up half of
his group's money, in keeping with the Royals requirement. The
Royals want to sell for $75 million. If Prentice gets to the 50
percent mark, his group would buy the baseball team, assuming his
group gets approval from Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Prentice again declined on Friday to say how close he is to 50
percent, other than to repeat, ``we're close.''
</P>
<P>
   Some members of Prentice's group are already known. They include
banker R. Crosby Kemper Jr.; mortgage banker James B. Nutter Jr.;
Julia Irene Kauffman and Nancy Kauffman, the daughter and
daughter-in-law, respectively, of the late Royals owner Ewing
Kauffman; and Buck O'Neil, a player and manager for the Kansas City
Monarchs of the old Negro Leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers have been impressed by Prentice's ability to come
into Kansas City and put together a group to buy the Royals _
something Kansas Citians have been unable to do on their own.
What's more, Prentice's group is made up of such disparate types as
Kemper, who is a civic booster but not a baseball fan, and now
Watson, who is a baseball fan but whose civic profile isn't so
high.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy (Prentice) is good. This guy is one of the best. It's
impressive,'' said Kevin Gray, president of the Greater Kansas City
Sports Commission, who watched the press conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, if he can put together a ball team like he can a PR
campaign, this guy is going to be good. He is exciting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to get behind this guy. He's doing everything he
possibly can,'' said Gray, who had favored the rival bid from Lamar
Hunt and Western Resources Inc. Hunt and Western withdrew on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Watson said he got motivated a week or more ago when he was
listening to a radio interview show and heard Royals President Mike
Herman explain that if the Royals are not sold to local buyers, the
team may have to leave Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The following day, Watson's manager called Prentice and ended up
talking to Prentice four times that day. Prentice visited their
office the following day.
</P>
<P>
   Watson said he decided Thursday evening to invest with Prentice
and signed up on Friday morning. The announcement was made at 3
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Watson said he last played baseball as a boy for the Hen House
Chicks in 1958. The following year he got cut, ``and I never played
baseball again. I started playing another game. It ended up being
pretty good to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson, of course, went on to become one of the best golfers of
all time. He's won the British Open tournament five times, the
Masters tournament twice and the U.S. Open once.

WITH PRESEASON OVER, TIME FOR THE REAL GIANTS TO SHOW UP 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Same uniforms, almost all the same guys,
same coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Who then, were those New York Giants in full retreat Friday
night at Giants Stadium?
</P>
<P>
   Giants fans watching their team bungle and stumble its way
through Friday night's final preseason game had to be wondering
what happened to the driven, disciplined team from a year ago, the
one that never relinquished a halftime lead, was undefeated in its
division and lost just twice in the final 13 weeks of the regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have lacked more than anything, is a game that counts,
something with real punches flying,'' safety Percy Ellsworth said
after the Giants sleep-walked through a 14-6 defeat to the
Baltimore Ravens.
</P>
<P>
   Ellsworth added that his team has missed something else in four
preseason games, three that ended in losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Fassel is going to be a madman again,'' Ellsworth said.
``And he needs to be. That's what we need. He's been laid back this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the division champs and all that. But it's going to be a
rude awakening for some of the new guys around here. Wait until
they see the coach this week. I'll put my money on him. It'll be a
different team by next weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel promised a similar transformation. Coach and players also
insisted that getting ready for the season opener against
Washington on Sept. 6 will require more than a week of motivational
speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps to be preparing a game plan to beat a specific
team,'' quarterback Danny Kanell said. ``You get in meetings, you
go to practice and you're not just running your set plays against
your own defense. We've been doing that for so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead we'll be running plays designed within a game plan to
beat Washington. We haven't done that yet and it definitely brings
a sense of urgency to the whole team.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Fassel has convinced his charges that pregame strategy
is one of his strengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody ever surprised us last year,'' Sam Garnes, the Giants
second-year strong safety, said Friday. ``I remember as a rookie,
we'd be in a meeting, and our coaches would tell us: `They're going
to do this and that.' And then in the game, there it would be, just
like they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of confidence that the coaches will prepare us
right. We just follow the plan.''
</P>
<P>
   There is another thing the leaders of this Giants team _
fullback Charles Way, linebacker Jessie Armstead and defensive end
Michael Strahan _ are looking forward to once the season begins:
Playing the whole game.
</P>
<P>
   In the preseason, the Giants starters never played more than a
half of any game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys take time to get going,'' Kanell said. ``In the
preseason, we'd just be finding a rhythm and we're out of there.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the Giants first stringers left a 1998 preseason
game trailing just once, against the Jacksonville Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad the preseason is over,'' said Fassel, who seemed
composed and almost relieved after Friday night's game. ``There's a
lot of things that are going to change right now. Those guys in the
locker room know there's a big difference in how I prepare them in
the preseason and the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them after the game tonight. OK, we're 1-3 in the
preseason. If we don't take care of our business, we're 1-3 again
in the regular season.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is how the Giants started the 1997 regular season before
closing with a 9-2-1 dash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real Giants will have to come out of hiding,'' Ellsworth
said.

   UNDATED: harder?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ford, executive director of the National Nutritional
Foods Association, which represents health-food stores and
supplement manufacturers, agreed there was little scientific data
that androstenedione benefited athletes. But he said the anecdotal
evidence so far has been positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get very positive reports on its effectiveness by the
people who use it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the risks: ``If there were any injuries or deaths, I'm
sure the FDA would be all over us,'' Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   Andro isn't a new supplement. It may have been part of the East
German's ``doping system'' for its Olympic athletes years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But it has only been in recent years that organizations like the
NCAA and the International Olympic Committee formally added it to
their ``banned'' lists.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to that, it was collapsed into the ``And Related
Compounds'' list of banned substances, but wasn't explicitly named.
</P>
<P>
   But andro gained in popularity. It started popping up on the
Internet. Coaches and athletes barraged the NCAA with phone calls
and e-mails, wondering if androstenedione was legal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we were telling them it wasn't,'' said Frank
Uryasz, the NCAA's director of sports sciences. ``Their response
was, `But it's not on the list.'''
</P>
<P>
   So, in 1997, both the NCAA and the IOC added androstenedione to
their formal lists of banned substances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a steroid,'' said Don Catlin, a member of the IOC
Medical Commission, the body that determines which substances are
banned. ``There's really no question about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the NCAA sent a letter to both the FDA and
the Drug Enforcement Administration complaining about the easy
accessibility of androstenedione.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we would like to see is some government regulation,''
Uryasz said. ``I would guess parents have no idea kids can walk
into a vitamin store and buy this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Kansas City-based National Federation of State
High School Associations gave its official position on andro,
reiterating that it is ``...against the use of any drug, medication
or food supplement by high school athletes solely for
performance-enhancing purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Professional sports hasn't agreed on a single approach to andro.
</P>
<P>
   The National Football League added androstenedione to its list
of banned ``Anabolic//Androgenic Steroids,'' a list of more than 20
substances, in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a steroid,'' said NFL league spokesman Greg Aiello. ``It
should be classified as such.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, andro is one of the substances the NFL's
drug-testing program covers. The league conducts about 10,000
steroid tests a year. There is also periodic testing during the
off-season, perhaps even at a player's residence.
</P>
<P>
   The National Hockey League, like major league baseball, takes a
more hands-off approach: If a substance is legal in the United
States, such as andro, it is legal in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no list of banned substances,'' said NHL league vice
president Frank Brown. ``This isn't the NFL or the IOC or any other
organization that has had extensive experience with steroid
abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   As Bill Daly, the senior vice president for legal affairs, said,
``If (andro) were being abused, we would become concerned and our
programs' doctors would take the appropriate steps.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA's drug policy, which was initiated in 1983 but is now in
limbo as players and owners squabble over a new
collective-bargaining agreement, covers just cocaine and heroin.
</P>
<P>
   What that means is that NBA players taking steroids raise no
more red flags than, say, players chewing gum.
</P>
<P>
   If andro is harmful, the biggest risk may be to young people who
see athletes like McGwire as role models, said John Renner, an
Independence physician and authority on quackery and questionable
health products.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sends a message to every high school athlete, every high
school coach that the only way to go big time is to take things.
That's tragic,'' Renner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's chemically cheating. I wonder what Babe Ruth would have
done on steroids?''

WARTINGER FINDS THAT SPEED THRILLS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash.)  (lb) 
 By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bob Wartinger, the speedboat driver from Seattle known as the
fastest man in outboards, once owned more trophies than he knew
what to do with. But that was before he thought about recycling
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We loaded up several station-wagons full of trophies,'' he
said in a recent telephone interview. ``I gave them all away except
the national ones. We hauled them off to a trophy company. The
money we got went to an adult softball league that my family
supports. It was something, seeing those cars filled up.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the 53-year-old Wartinger regularly donates his prizes to
children who compete in junior speedboat classes. And the habit is
very likely to continue. With 99 national and world records to his
credit, Wartinger is about to become the first person in speedboat
history to hit the 100-record mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several of us in the sport have had a lot of wins,'' said
Steve David, president of the American Power Boat Association.
``But none of us have had that number of wins. Bob is a tremendous
engineer who is very analytical, but very outgoing as well. He
understands the hydrodynamics of boats. He's the real thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The 100th record could come as early as Sunday. Wartinger plans
to compete this weekend in a two-day race at Silver Lake in
Eatonville, Wash. ``The air's cool, and the engines like it,'' he
said. ``It's the best time to set records.''
</P>
<P>
   He will be driving a 10-foot hydroplane with a 30-horsepower
Yamato engine. On a straightaway, the boat is capable of 70 mph. On
the competition course, which is a three-quarter-mile oval, the
average speed to beat is 55.021 mph over four laps.
</P>
<P>
   A key strategy is to cross the start line at full throttle. But
if he is more than a few inches over early, a video camera will
pick up the error and disqualify him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you cross the start line at 50 miles an hour, your first
lap will be slow,'' Wartinger said, ``and you've probably blown the
record.''
</P>
<P>
   With a master's degree from the University of Washington in
aeronautics and astronautics, Wartinger took a job at Boeing in
1969. He is now a senior program manager for advanced systems.
</P>
<P>
   But in his free time, he has another life practicing yoga and
teaching adult courses in Ayurveda, an ancient holistic discipline
from India.
</P>
<P>
   His background makes Wartinger an enigma in a sport where
machismo is as much a part of winning as turning over the engine.
He is soft-spoken, dedicated and driven. It took four years of
testing before Wartinger would attempt the run that has brought him
the most renown: the 176.556-mph outboard speed record set in
November 1989 on the Colorado River in Parker, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Wartinger's 20-foot hydroplane ran with a modified
500-horsepower Evinrude V-8 outboard engine. No one has come close
to matching its performance since then. Even Wartinger has not
tried.
</P>
<P>
   ``The toughest records are your old records, because you already
did your best,'' he said. ``So in racing, I don't find a lot of
multiple record setters.'' Of the 99 records he has set since 1971,
22 are still standing.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wartinger grew up in the Pacific Northwest, where he remembers
pulling a toy boat by a string behind his bicycle the way other
children fly kites.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager, he built his first boat. It was an 8-foot
hydroplane that he saw pictured in an issue of Popular Science
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always felt it was a lot more fun in smaller boats
because it's better competition,'' he said. ``I like the real close
racing, the packs of boats. I've always chosen the class that has
the most people in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wartinger has raced in about 35 different classes, mostly in
small stock boats; the only type of boat he has not raced is an
offshore boat. His successes are global. Twice, in 1989 and 1996,
he received the outstanding sportsman award, the top honor bestowed
by the Union International Motonautique, the sport's international
governing body.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, he and two French teammates won the 24 Hours of Rouen,
a power-boat endurance race on the Seine River in Rouen, France.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I deal with it is competency,'' Wartinger said, trying
to explain his success. ``I don't believe I'll win every race. I'd
like to, so there's a time when you take a calculated risk. I
decide if I can drive into that certain corner, or whether I have
to go outside. It's a matter of driving to the limits of your
equipment.''

MCGWIRE'S USE OF ANDROSTENEDIONE OPENS DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN BAVLEY AND STEVE ROCK  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: As St. Louis Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire closes in
on Roger Maris' single-season home run record, are the pills he's
popping giving him an advantage?
</P>
<P>
   McGwire recently acknowledged taking androstenedione, an
over-the-counter substance that is legal in major league baseball
but banned by some other sports.
</P>
<P>
   Some athletes and body builders are taking ``andro'' in the
belief that it helps pump up their muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Concern about its growing popularity spurred the NCAA recently
to call for a government crackdown on andro sales.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, major-league baseball officials announced they
would take a more in-depth look at ``the general use of nutritional
supplements by major league players.''
</P>
<P>
   And on Thursday, the Association of Tennis Professionals banned
androstenedione from the men's tennis tour.
</P>
<P>
   But as controversy brews in the sports world, medical experts
are raising doubts about whether androstenedione is doing any good
at all for body builders _ or for Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, federal regulators have adopted a hands-off policy
toward andro and other hormones such as DHEA
(dehydro-epiandrosterone) and melatonin that are sold as
nutritional supplements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any evidence that it's going to affect
his ability to hit home runs one way or the other,'' said Neil
Schimke, professor of medicine and endocrinology at the University
of Kansas Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   So is it a placebo?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a hunch it probably is,'' Schimke said.
</P>
<P>
   Androstenedione is a hormone that occurs naturally in men and,
in smaller quantities, in women. On its own, it works as a weak
male hormone.
</P>
<P>
   The rationale for taking androstenedione is that the body turns
it into the male hormone testosterone, which really can build
muscles but is available only with a doctor's prescription, or
through illegal black market sources.
</P>
<P>
   As one ad on the World Wide Web touts, andro lets you ``boost
your testosterone the legal way!''
</P>
<P>
   But there's a catch.
</P>
<P>
   There is no good scientific evidence that androstenedione
supplements _ which can run more than $2 per capsule _ will produce
enough testosterone to have any effect on performance, said Thomas
Incledon, a Boca Raton, Fla., exercise physiologist and member of
the National Strength and Conditioning Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of marketing hype here,'' Incledon said. ``It
would be nice for companies to come out with research studies, peer
reviewed, before they release their products.''
</P>
<P>
   Because androstenedione is sold as a nutritional supplement
rather than a drug, its makers don't have to give the Food and Drug
Administration the kind of data on safety and effectiveness that
drug manufacturers have to before putting products on the market.
</P>
<P>
   And the FDA doesn't take action against the sale of supplements
unless there are unsubstantiated health claims on a product's
label, or the FDA finds that a supplement is unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really don't have much to say (about androstenedione),''
said FDA spokeswoman Ruth Welch. ``At this time these types of
products are not excluded from being marketed as dietary
supplements.''
</P>
<P>
   If andro actually works as well as its promoters claim, it would
be just as risky to take as testosterone, doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   When a man with normal blood levels of testosterone consumes a
little extra, the pituitary gland, which regulates hormone levels,
may turn down the body's own production.
</P>
<P>
   But athletes who take extreme doses of testosterone may
experience all kinds of horrendous side effects: Their prostate
gland may swell, their testicles shrivel, their blood cholesterol
rise, their liver become damaged and their temper explode.
</P>
<P>
   Women who take large amounts of testosterone can go through some
of the physical changes of a boy in puberty, such as developing a
deeper voice and growing facial and body hair.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have raised enough doubts about androstenedione's
safety that General Nutrition Cos. Inc., told its 3,700 vitamin and
supplement stores in June they were barred from selling andro
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it a safe product for anyone to take? No one knows. No one
has used it in orthodox medicine,'' said David Sneid, a Kansas City
endocrinologist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of amazed that it wasn't on a banned list of major
league baseball. It just shows they're behind the times,'' Sneid
said.
</P>
<P>
   Major league baseball's drug testing is applied only to admitted
or detected drug users. Even then, the league tests for cocaine,
marijuana, amphetamines, opiates and PCP _ but not steroids.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has reacted angrily to questions about his andro use.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's legal,'' he told reporters last Saturday. ``There's
absolutely nothing wrong with it.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has used andro for more than a year. He has said he
wouldn't put his health at risk, and that he has been assured andro
isn't harmful.
</P>
<P>
   Royals pitcher Jeff Montgomery discounted the effect of andro on
McGwire's home run spree.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy is big and strong, and he still has to put the bat on
the ball. And he's very good at doing that,'' Montgomery said in
Baltimore before the Royals game Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the most positive effect he's found from taking the
dietary supplement has been the ability to stay healthy and
rebound. And that's why he's doing it. He's hardly had a season in
his career where he's been able to stay healthy from start to
finish.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire spent time on the disabled list every season from 1992
to 1996. But he's been healthy for the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   If androstenedione works that well, it's giving McGwire an
unfair advantage by allowing him to play more games, Sneid said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this allows him to strengthen himself without injury, isn't
that as much of a performance-enhancer as being able to hit the
ball harder?'' he asked. MORE

   UNDATED: Why is Russia an apparently hopeless case? It is, after
all, a country abundantly endowed with natural resources. Moreover,
its people _ its human resources _ have historically shown
themselves capable of great energy and courage.
</P>
<P>
   The short answer is that Russia is what happens when people over
several generations lose all power to control their destiny in even
the smallest aspects of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Russia suffers a form of what some psychologists might
characterize as learned helplessness.
</P>
<P>
   Among Russia's masses there is no memory of how would-be
entrepreneurs create their own enterprises without becoming
lawbreakers and risking a trip to the gulag. The only memory is
that of obediently doing what the state tells them to do.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is what happens to humankind when its energy and creative
spirit are yoked by communist socialism.
</P>
<P>
   When is the last time you picked up a manufactured article
bearing the words, ``Made in Russia,'' or ``Made in the Soviet
Union''?
</P>
<P>
   Russia wasn't known as a market-driven industrial dynamo before
the communist revolution, but it wouldn't make any difference now
even if it had been. After three-quarters of a century of
communism, nobody is left with any memory of how a market economy
is supposed to work.
</P>
<P>
   The reason most Americans _ the world's most prodigious
consumers _ aren't likely to remember buying anything made in
Russia or the U.S.S.R. is because the business of the Soviet Union
was building a military machine to conquer the world.
</P>
<P>
   Those living in postwar market economies got personal computers,
better automobiles, more efficient appliances, seamless worldwide
communication and a cornucopia of consumables. The Russians,
meanwhile, got tanks, guns, bombs, missiles and long waits in
queues to purchase life's day-to-day essentials at stores with
often-empty shelves. Despite Russia's awesome natural and human
resources, the nation emerged from its long embrace with communist
socialism as backward and impoverished as a Third World country.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to believe now, but in the years following the
Russian revolution, many of the West's intellectual elites
perceived Soviet-style communism as humankind's last best hope.
</P>
<P>
   The grim denouement of this failed experiment, however, is
Russia's pitiful effort to create a market economy viable enough to
support a decent existence for its citizens. This requires taking
an economy that once devoted half its resources to military
production and transforming it into a consumer economy. It must do
so without any leader possessing the experience to help achieve
this goal.
</P>
<P>
   Capitalist economies, for instance, owe their existence to sound
financial systems critically dependent on basic human honesty.
Raising capital is virtually impossible without a rational banking
system, and capitalism is impossible without capital.
</P>
<P>
   The legacy of communism, though, is that it encouraged the worst
sorts of human behavior. Only the cruelest, greediest and most
ruthless rose to the top. The residue of that legacy in the '90s
has been the rise to political power of kleptocrats and the seizure
of economic power by criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Economic progress is impossible unless it's pursued in the
context of improving society's condition. Until Russia's leaders
understand this, the country's future is hopeless.

THE COOK WHO ILLUSTRATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL WENDHOLT SILVA  
 c. 1998 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MERRIAM, Kan. _ Setting aside his whisk for a paintbrush, Brent
Watkinson captures the silver-powder highlights, blue-black shades
and juicy plumpness of a bunch of Concord grapes.
</P>
<P>
   In the basement studio in his Merriam home, Watkinson brushes
paint on a lush, still-life oil painting of succulent watermelon
wedges, voluptuous papayas and apricots that appear so ripe it's
easy to imagine you can smell their aromas.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm trying to bring to the painting is a sense of
theater, romance and elegance ... To try to make really humble
products look good,'' the 37-year-old illustrator says. ``I lean
heavily on the use of light. That's all an artist has _ light and
dark, and somewhere in between.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last five years Watkinson's paintings have appeared on
all but two covers of the popular Cook's Illustrated, a
step-by-step, no-nonsense cooking magazine that is highly regarded
by serious home cooks and professional chefs.
</P>
<P>
   A culinary Consumer Reports of sorts, the magazine accepts no
advertising. And, instead of slick, glossy photographs of prepared
dishes carefully styled with tweezers and spritzed with oil to look
more appetizing, a Cook's Illustrated cover is a moody depiction of
unadorned fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you start cutting up and cooking food you don't have
as much to work with,'' says Christopher Kimball, editor and
publisher of Cook's Illustrated, which appears six times a year and
has 300,000 subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simple fruits and vegetables tend to give more of an art feel.
There are shapes and textures to work with,'' he says from Boston
where the magazine is based.
</P>
<P>
   Kimball has been publishing Cook's Illustrated off and on since
1980. When he relaunched it without advertising and lifestyle
features back in 1993, he decided he wanted a cover that would
celebrate ``the glory of food.''
</P>
<P>
   He quickly ruled out photography, then considered using
historical art illustrations, but eventually decided the magazine
should develop its own signature style.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started looking at illustrators we found most had a
very commercial style,'' he said. ``We wanted somebody who had a
more fine-art feel and could really do something that is a painting
that could be put on a wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brent's work is quiet _ not flashy _ just like the magazine.
We joke that we don't use adjectives in our stories like `great!'
The cover should also be straightforward. We're not trying to be
too commercial.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the unconventional cover has been given prominent display
space at newsstands where it is racking up sales of 50,000 copies
per issue despite the rather hefty $4 single copy price tag.
</P>
<P>
   In another ironic twist, the magazine got an unpaid plug earlier
this summer when it was prominently featured on a newsstand in
``The Truman Show'' starring comedian//actor Jim Carrey.
</P>
<P>
   Watkinson typically works about six months ahead of publication.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the Concord grapes that appear on the current
September//October issue were shipped from the East Coast packed on
dry ice back in May 1997. It's a highly perishable fruit that does
not ship well so Watkinson immediately set to work shooting
photographs for reference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I opened the box and they smelled heavenly, but they looked
terrible in about 20 minutes. They were so fragile that they were
like working with eggs,'' he recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the availability of fresh fruits and vegetables
shipped in the dead of winter from the Southern Hemisphere, 90
percent of the time Watkinson can work ``live,'' picking his own
produce from bins at the local supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   But there are always exceptions, such as the $400 crate of
papayas shipped from Tokyo, to Hawaii and San Francisco before
finally arriving in Kansas City. Or the fragrant Seckel pears he
will use for the coming holiday issue that were shipped in from
Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   After choosing the produce, Watkinson will scout antique, import
and fabric stores for the perfect props. For a cover on green
beans, Watkinson had an image of a white-enamel colander. The bok
choy cover was a struggle until he found the perfect
Oriental-looking fabric.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to find my own props,'' Watkinson says.
``That's as much fun as doing the thing. I get all excited trying
to find just the right (backdrop) fabric.''
</P>
<P>
   Next he builds a set. Then he ``lives it, breathes it and
caresses it.'' He faxes a thumbnail sketch to the magazine's art
director for final approval. Finally he grabs a brush from the
recycled Goya, Van Kamp's and Del Monte cans on his desk and
paints.
</P>
<P>
   It takes Watkinson about two weeks to complete each original 10-
by 13-inch canvas. He sends the magazine's art director a 4- by
5-inch transparency via Fed Ex.
</P>
<P>
   Watkinson had never met Kimball. But two years ago when Kimball
appeared on a Kansas City radio show to promote The Cook's Bible
Watkinson called in to introduce himself. They ended up having
barbecue together.
</P>
<P>
   In the often avant-garde world of art, still lifes of artfully
arranged fruits and vegetables might seem almost retro. Yet
Watkinson finds the students he teaches at the Kansas City Art
Institute and the Illustration Academy are often intrigued by the
straightforwardness of his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are kind of fascinated because you can tell if its
working or not,'' he says. ``It's Old World fastidiousness. It's
not innovative, but you have to draw well enough to paint and draw
loose enough to paint well.''
</P>
<P>
   About 85 percent of Watkinson's professional work revolves
around food. He's the illustrator behind several name brand
products found on supermarket shelves, including the Hispanic woman
that appears on Contadina labels, labels for Five Brothers pasta
sauces and promotional material for the Outback Steakhouse chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people go to a gallery to see their work ... I go to the
supermarket,'' he jokes. MORE
</P>
<P>
   MERRIAM, Kan. _ supermarket,'' he jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Watkinson says some of his most satisfying food work
continues to be the less commercial work he does for Cook's
Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so much fun it almost feels like cheating to make a
living this way,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Watkinson describes himself as a ``basic eater,'' a ``wine
hack'' and a casual cook. He especially enjoys cooking with his
wife, Jodi, a school psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   They frequently use techniques and recipes from Cook's
Illustrated because ``it's not pretentious like those goofy gourmet
magazines.''
</P>
<P>
   Watkinson is already raving about the stuffed mushroom recipe he
tried from the September//October issue of the magazine. ``Oh,
stand back! I'd fight you for one of those. There's a little too
much blue cheese and a little too much bacon, and it's just
right.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Watkinson has always been fascinated by food.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always liked food. I've always like to eat and smell
things. I love to try new things. I don't care what it is as long
as it is really full-flavored.''
</P>
<P>
   And he puts taste above presentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't dislike having pretty food, but it can be normal and
plain in presentation as long as it tastes good,'' he says.

EX-YALE CHIEF TO REVIEW CITY UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Six years ago, Benno Schmidt resigned as president of
Yale University to direct the Edison Project, an ambitious effort
to run a national network of schools on a for-profit basis.
</P>
<P>
   But on a recent morning, his mind was back on higher education,
his sofa and coffee table piled high with reports not on elementary
schools in Wichita, Kan., or Boston but on the City University of
New York. In May, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a long-time critic of
City University, appointed him to lead a task force to review the
university and its mission and to draw up a new blueprint that
would ``dramatically change'' its course.
</P>
<P>
   Some faculty members and other critics see the task force as
part of a campaign by the mayor to shrink the university and
transfer some of its functions to privately run organizations. They
also charge that the panel is made up of people who share the
mayor's views.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt vehemently rejected charges that the group has a prior
agenda, saying his integrity and that of his colleagues were at
stake.
</P>
<P>
   The task force review comes at a time of turmoil for the
university and its 200,000 students. The board of trustees has
pledged to remake the university, and in May, under pressure from
the mayor and Gov. George Pataki, it voted to ban remedial
education at the senior colleges.
</P>
<P>
   But the trustees have not offered any larger strategy, and if
the mayor has his way, the task force report could well provide
that strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt sees the task force as an opportunity to develop not
just a new vision for City University, but also a new paradigm for
public higher education in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the time is ripe for CUNY to ask itself what it wants
to be for the next several decades,'' he said. ``And I've had a lot
of people say that if we are able to create a thoughtful and
persuasive analysis and set of recommendations that it will be very
interesting for public institutions around the country because many
are facing similar issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that education is today's frontier,
today's civil rights struggle,'' he said. ``It is the absolutely
critical door of opportunity _ or not _ and in some ways it is
both.''
</P>
<P>
   So with the fervor of a lawyer preparing for the case of his
life, Schmidt, a 56-year-old constitutional scholar, has spent the
summer immersed in CUNY and the complexities of public higher
education, focusing on specifics like remedial education as well as
the broader issue of how a university can meet the needs of a
diverse population like New York City's.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to meet the mayor's six-month deadline, he has convened
nine closed meetings of the task force. With the group's executive
director, Roger Benjamin of Rand Corp., he has met separately with
the presidents and deans of CUNY's undergraduate colleges and
graduate programs, as well as the interim university chancellor,
Christoph Kimmich, and his staff and many of the trustees. The task
force is still considering whether to hold open hearings and to
survey opinions among faculty, students or alumni.
</P>
<P>
   To try to meet the mayor's six-month deadline, Schmidt has hired
more than a dozen consultants from Rand and Price Waterhouse
Coopers _ people with ``unimpeachable objectivity,'' he says _ and
he is trying to raise half a million dollars in private
contributions to cover the cost.
</P>
<P>
   He has asked the consultants to describe and assess the
university and to consider, among other issues, how its budget is
allocated, how remediation works, how the university's priorities
are set and how it works in relationship with the city's high
schools.
</P>
<P>
   But he has also asked the consultants to report on public higher
education in America, to offer comparisons, other models, other
data. Their research _ what he calls the ``empirical foundation''
for his group's work _ will be published separately from the task
force recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt clearly relishes the intellectual challenge of the task.
And although he declined to discuss City University directly during
two interviews in his bright Fifth Avenue office, he discussed the
task force's progress and his own thinking about its work.
</P>
<P>
   On the subject of open admissions, for example, Schmidt would
not comment on university policy, but said he believes that higher
admissions requirements can prod students and high schools into
aiming higher themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``CUNY is not responsible for the deficiencies in the education
of the graduates of New York City and other public schools,'' he
said. ``But CUNY and other higher education institutions can have
real influence on the extent to which schools embrace standards. I
believe clarity of standards has a huge impact on levels of
academic achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he also believes strongly in higher education as a
source of opportunity, in the value of competition from businesses
in education, and in the need to set standards that can be clearly
measured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Accountability measures help people do a better job,'' he
said, applauding efforts in other states to measure how much
students learn in public universities and how productive those
universities are.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Such observations are what make many faculty members and
students at City University fearful that he has a vision far
different from theirs. Still, as Schmidt and his researchers have
made their campus visits, some faculty members and students have
said they were pleasantly surprised by the tone of the discussion,
although they still express misgivings about what they believe will
be the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an interesting dialogue,'' said Mizanoor Biswas,
president of the university student senate and the student
representative on the university board. He said Schmidt let him and
other student government leaders talk extensively of their concerns
about the ban on remedial programs and other topics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not expect it to be that good; I thought we would be
asked questions about attendance,'' he said, alluding to Giuliani's
contention that the university did not pay enough attention to
attendance records.
</P>
<P>
   Others on campus, however, remained more skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``He essentially said all the right things _ `We're going to
examine this' and `My integrity depends on this,''' said Bernard
Sohmer, a City College math professor and president of the
university faculty senate, describing Schmidt's meeting with its
executive committee. Schmidt does not anticipate having a final
report much before the end of the year, but says there may be
interim reports, possibly as early as next month, on topics like
remedial education.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the mayor and the trustees will embrace the final report
is also an open question. The mayor has been known to reject task
force reports that do not please him, as he did with one in March
on relations between the police and the public.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt has learned from his experience with Edison that change
can be unexpectedly difficult to achieve. When he left Yale, he
talked of creating a ``revolution in education,'' and Edison's goal
was to be running 200 schools by 1996, but the total will have
reached only 50 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he says the mayor has been supportive so far. And he
clearly hopes the committee report will have an effect well beyond
City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is clear beyond a doubt that the time is ripe for
CUNY to ask itself what it wants to be for the next several
decades,'' he said. ``There is no question in my mind that
significant changes in the outcome are very possible. The question
is whether there is the will and political capacity to do it.''

CABLE TV'S LIFETIME LIFELINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON BARNHART  
 c. 1998 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: If you want to know why TV network sitcoms are so
dreadfully the same, says Dan O'Shannon, walk a mile in his shoes.
</P>
<P>
   O'Shannon, a veteran writer-producer for the classic comedies
``Cheers'' and ``Newhart'' _ as well as the less distinguished
``Suddenly Susan'' _ could not find a broadcast network interested
in his sitcom about a 40-year-old married mother going through a
midlife crisis because, he says, network executives thought 40 and
married were not what people wanted to watch on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately O'Shannon left a well-paying development deal at NBC
to create his show for Lifetime, the cable channel for women.
``Maggie,'' as it's now called, stars Ann Cusack. It has its
premiere at 9 tonight (9 Tuesday night CDT), one of three new
series that are part of Lifetime's strategy to woo female viewers
away from the networks.
</P>
<P>
   Besides ``Maggie,'' Lifetime has given 13-episode orders to ``Oh
Baby,'' a sitcom about another near-midlife woman (Cynthia
Stevenson) whose body is instructing her to get pregnant, with or
without Mr. Right; and ``Any Day Now,'' a drama about two women
(Annie Potts and Lorraine Toussaint) reunited as adults after
growing up in Birmingham at the height of civil-rights tensions.
</P>
<P>
   ABC and NBC were among the networks that expressed interest in
``Maggie'' (not to be confused with the new Faith Ford sitcom
``Maggie Winters,'' making itys debut next month on CBS). But in a
telling sign of how network programmers perceive reality, they
wanted the character to be younger _ a lot younger _ than 40.
</P>
<P>
   According to O'Shannon, the networks also hated that Maggie
becomes interested in a veterinarian at the clinic where she works
after realizing her husband, a high-powered heart surgeon, has
stopped paying attention to her.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the ``Maggie'' pilot, it's hard to figure out what the
networks were thinking. Cusack plays the lead without melodrama or
malice, the storyline is hardly a downer, the supporting characters
(including the wacky vet Maggie falls for, played by John Slattery)
are great, and the writing really crackles. It's quite possibly the
funniest new sitcom of the fall.
</P>
<P>
   That's the problem, in O'Shannon's view. By trying to make every
new show revolve around 30-year-old single gals, the networks are
playing a short-term game of demographics. And they're doing it at
the expense of what viewers ultimately reward: shows that move them
and make them laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sitcoms in the last 50 years _ what's really changed about
them except the technology?'' O'Shannon said in a telephone
interview last week. ``If you watch `Leave It to Beaver,' you learn
it's bad to lie to your friends and that if you do you'll get in
trouble. If you watch `Suddenly Susan,' you learn it's bad to lie
to your friends and if you do you'll get in trouble. People grew up
with sitcoms, but the sitcoms didn't grow up with the people.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Shannon said that message was repeatedly driven home to him in
regular ``pitch meetings'' with NBC executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I had a meeting with Warren Littlefield'' _ head of
the network's entertainment division _ ``he would listen to the
premise of the show, the characters, what I wanted to do and say
with the show. And after I presented he'd go, `Uh huh. I don't
think America wants to see that. How about a '90s version of
``Three's Company''?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Every four months, O'Shannon said, he would knock himself out
thinking of innovative story ideas. Then he'd go to the pitch
meeting and Littlefield would say, ``I don't think America's
screaming for that. How about a '90s version of `Kate and Allie'?''
</P>
<P>
   It was after Littlefield suggested, at a subsequent meeting,
that he develop a '90s version of ``Chico and the Man'' that
O'Shannon flipped.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I quit my deal. I said, `Look, you're paying me a lot of
money to create shows, when what you really want to do is re-create
shows.' ''
</P>
<P>
   (Littlefield was on vacation last week and could not be reached
for comment. But an NBC spokesman expressed regret that O'Shannon
felt the need to dredge up long-ago conversations from their
private meetings.)
</P>
<P>
   Lifetime CEO Doug McCormick said ``Maggie'' and the two other
new series will shore up Lifetime's status as the No. 1 basic-cable
channel for women ages 18-49. As is typical of a cable network,
Lifetime is counterprogramming the networks where McCormick thinks
they're most vulnerable. The two comedies are airing in the 9 p.m.
slot, when networks are doing dramas and newsmagazines, while ``Any
Day Now'' airs at 8, opposite network sitcoms.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy, said McCormick, has worked so far with its
late-night magazine show, ``New Attitudes''; with monthly original
movies geared to women, some featuring protagonists at the high end
of the 18-49 age range; and with ``Intimate Portraits,'' a
``Biography'' clone. Branching into sitcom and drama development
was the logical next step.
</P>
<P>
   Top TV studios Paramount, Columbia TriStar and Spelling
Television are on board, and McCormick believes he has three
quality shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for shows that were definitely out of the
ordinary from those you'd find on the broadcast networks, that
would be women-centric and wouldn't have people living in
$10,000-a-month apartments on $2,000-a-month salaries,'' McCormick
said. ``We wanted to get a little more real, and I think we've
batted a thousand on that.''

``In the Company of Men,'' revolved around one of the more original
characters in recent cinema: Chad, an amoral young executive with
the instincts of a shark.
</P>
<P>
   With his latest, ``Your Friends &AMP; Neighbors'' (which opened
Friday), LaBute offers a view of the human menagerie that's no less
primal or uncompromising.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain kind of emotional violence that runs through
both of them,'' the former theater and film professor said recently
from his home in Fort Wayne, Ind. If anything, his new film ``may
be even slightly more brutal.''
</P>
<P>
   That's really saying something, inasmuch as ``In the Company of
Men'' proved to be one of the most hotly debated American films of
1997.
</P>
<P>
   In methodical detail, ``Company'' outlines Chad's campaign to
humiliate a deaf woman whom he barely knows, with the complicity of
a colleague. They agree to romance and then dump the woman just for
the hell of it. That Chad never gets his comeuppance led some
viewers to conclude that LaBute condoned the character's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   That, the writer//director said, was an unfortunate misreading
of his intent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I, in fact, tried pretty carefully to make it not be
misogynist,'' said LaBute, who earned a master's degree in theater
and film at the University of Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``(I tried) to have enough episodes in the film that showed the
breadth of Chad's hatred for people _ basically, toward anyone
other than himself,'' LaBute said.
</P>
<P>
   The premise of the movie ``was misogynistic, of course. But the
film really ends up not being about that. To me, it was just about
power _ how one wants it and abuses it. It's closer to misanthropy
than misogyny.''
</P>
<P>
   Constance Penley, professor of film studies and women's studies
at the University of California-Santa Barbara, said LaBute belongs
to a school of male artists who are ``making films that are
parodying, excoriating and mocking male arrogance, vanity and
narcissism.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense ``Your Friends &AMP; Neighbors'' is an unofficial sequel
to ``In the Company of Men,'' although ``Neighbors'' was in the
works before ``Company'' became a water-cooler topic.
</P>
<P>
   The new film focuses on the interactions of three men and three
women, some of whom change partners before its conclusion. The
high-profile cast includes Jason Patric, who also co-produced, and
Ben Stiller and Nastassja Kinski.
</P>
<P>
   The sole acting link between the films is Aaron Eckhart, whose
scary rendition of Chad gained him instant notoriety. But the actor
shows his versatility by essaying a totally different character in
``Neighbors.'' Here Eckhart plays Barry, a nice guy _ goofy and
overweight _ who's tragically oblivious to his losing his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was definitely a conscious attempt to take him far away
from where he'd been,'' said LaBute, who met Eckhart when the two
were students at Brigham Young University. ``I can't imagine not
wanting to work with him many more times.''
</P>
<P>
   Where ``Company'' had a more focused plot, LaBute said,
``Neighbors'' posed the challenge of making the often-explored
theme of middle-class morality seem fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it's just a comedy,'' he said. ``But it doesn't rely
on slapstick, or paint cans falling on people's heads.''
</P>
<P>
   As such, ``Neighbors'' plays out as a funky drawing-room comedy
for the nuclear age _ an offbeat marriage of David Mamet and Oscar
Wilde.
</P>
<P>
   That's hardly a formula for commercial success, and LaBute
conceded that there's much more pressure on ``Neighbors'' to reach
a significant audience than there was on his surprise hit debut.
</P>
<P>
   `` `In the Company of Men' drew a lot of press but didn't make a
great amount of money in the States or over the world,'' LaBute
said. ``Of course, for what it cost, it made a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Company'' cost about $250,000 to make and took in about $4
million worldwide, he said. ``Neighbors'' cost $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   LaBute, who taught at Indiana University-Purdue University
before becoming a full-time director, said that until recently he
was much more involved in theater than in filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   While studying dramatic writing at New York University, he was
awarded a literary fellowship at the prestigious Royal Court
Theatre in London. And he still cites playwrights as prime
influences on his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was influenced by a lot of English playwrights,'' LaBute
said. ``I love all those writers who came out of the 1960s and
'70s, from John Osborne on. Edward Bond, Caryl Churchill, David
Hare.''
</P>
<P>
   Harold Pinter, whose plays are drenched in the ominous and the
surreal, was also a big influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like that sort of menace that simmers in the background of
all of his plays,'' LaBute said. ``There's always some sort of
frightening atmosphere going on, a sort of tension that puts all
the scenes on edge. There aren't a lot of scenes of people just
playing in the park.''
</P>
<P>
   LaBute makes no apologies for his spare, unobtrusive style of
filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really more interested in the actors, I think, than I am
in moving the camera all over the place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he would like to correct the impression among some people
that he must be as misanthropic as some of his characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask why I have such a cynical view of life, and I don't
think I do,'' he said. ``I think the cynicism is in the filmmakers
who are out there doing whatever they can to get your money.
</P>
<P>
   ``They watch whatever works, and they refashion it, and put it
out there in another form _ whatever they think you want to hear.
They give you false sentiment and false, contrived endings, just so
you'll like it. And then they take your money.''

IT'S A NEW DAILY FOR JON STEWART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 bY AARON BARNHART  
 c. 1998 The Kansas City Star   UNDATED: Jon Stewart can remember
what it was like getting his big break in TV. After toiling for
years on the stand-up circuit and small-potatoes cable shows like
``Short Attention Span Theater,'' Stewart was approached in 1994 by
Paramount TV about doing a nationally syndicated late-night show.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paramount's previous effort in late night, ``The Arsenio Hall
Show,'' had changed television. Now ``The Jon Stewart Show'' was
going to change television!
</P>
<P>
   Today Stewart can summarize his nine months in syndication in
eight words: ``Be careful what you wish for, my friend.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jon Stewart Show'' was funny and smart, but it rode in on
Arsenio-sized expectations, which even Hall ultimately had trouble
living up to. Had Stewart remained on cable, he might have had
enough time to build a substantial audience.
</P>
<P>
   That, in fact, is what he'll get a second chance to do come
January, when Comedy Central installs him as the new host of ``The
Daily Show,'' its often outrageously great turn on the news. He'll
replace Craig Kilborn, who is headed to CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart will be reunited with the executive producer of his
Paramount show, Madeleine Smithberg, who created ``The Daily Show''
two years ago to replace another show, ``Politically Incorrect With
Bill Maher,'' which was heading to ABC.
</P>
<P>
   He won't just inherit the roomful of angry young writers that
give ``The Daily Show'' its edge _ as co-executive producer, a
title Kilborn never had, Stewart will become one of them. Also
unlike Kilborn, who did not build strong bonds with the writers
(apparently not one of them has been enticed to follow him to CBS),
Stewart is liked, respected and even revered by the staff.
</P>
<P>
   And who knows? Perhaps someday Stewart will follow in Maher's
and Kilborn's steps and go network. But not for a while. For one
thing, he's now locked into a four-year deal with Comedy Central
that reportedly will pay him more than $1 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Also, remember that part about being careful what you wish for?
These days, Stewart is.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goals for me have changed somewhat,'' said Stewart in a
telephone interview from New York last week. ``There's a bit of
seduction to the idea of being on network, but it got to the point
where that wasn't important. What's important is doing something
worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which is why I've always avoided being on a sitcom. Yeah, it's
high-profile and it's on a network, but you know what? You could be
on `Suddenly Stewart.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Stewart and Comedy Central _ the home of ``South Park''
_ make an ideal couple. The cable channel offers creative freedom
and an audience already well attuned to Stewart's sensibility. He
gives Comedy Central a brand-name talent and will be money in the
bank for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart has spent the past three years on a variety of projects
and making guest appearances on other people's talk shows.
Talk-show producers love him because he's easy to work with; hosts
marvel at his incredible ad-libbing powers.
</P>
<P>
   He also spent one year as designated guest host for Tom Snyder,
who is retiring and whose franchise is being handed over to
Kilborn. Stewart also played himself in the last season of ``The
Larry Sanders Show'' and helped punch up the show's scripts.
</P>
<P>
   And there was a development deal with Miramax Films. That
arrangement will continue; he'll have flex time to make films. Two
movies starring Stewart will be released later this year, as will
his first book, Naked Pictures of Famous People.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll see enough to be sick of me by the time I start doing
the show,'' Stewart promised.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's unlikely he will find any venue for his talents as
creatively rewarding as ``The Daily Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The currency of this show is your own head,'' he said.
``They've established a certain structure here, but it's still in
evolution.''
</P>
<P>
   As is _ one feels compelled to add _ Jon Stewart.

WHY SHOULD A HI-RISE BUILD A SIDEWALK SHED? GRAVITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Section 27-1021 of the New York City Administrative
Code dictates when and how sidewalk sheds should be erected to
protect pedestrians when work is being done on the exterior of a
building.
</P>
<P>
   The laws of physics dictate why. Earlier this month, when a
48-square-foot section of masonry broke loose from a 40th-floor
wall of a building on Lexington Avenue between 46th and 47th
streets, scores of falling bricks ricocheted off a lower roof and
broke into thousands of fragments that rained down on pedestrians
and traffic. Two bricks that didn't disintegrate punched a
foot-wide hole in the roof of a commuter bus.
</P>
<P>
   While no one was injured _ despite the absence of a sidewalk
shed or sidewalk bridging _ the incident illustrates the subtleties
and risks involved with repairs or maintenance on high-rise
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``No building owner really wants to put up a sidewalk shed,''
said James Samson, a Manhattan lawyer who specializes in co-op and
condominium law. ``But hammers fall out of windows and bricks fall
out of walls, and when that happens, everybody starts pointing the
finger at everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Samson said that while sidewalk sheds are necessary to protect
the public, they present a host of problems for building owners.
The sheds are expensive to construct and unsightly, he said. They
can discourage sales of apartments in a building and hurt
commercial tenants whose businesses depend on visibility and
accessibility. Sidewalk sheds also raise security concerns, Samson
said, because they can expose second- and third-floor apartments to
a greater risk of burglary.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't believe how many buildings will do whatever they
can do to avoid having to put up a sidewalk shed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ilyse Fink, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of
Buildings, said the conditions under which sheds must be erected
are clear. According to the administrative code, a shed must be
constructed whenever any part of a facade more than 40 feet above
ground level is being altered or repaired, and when the distance
between the inside edge of the sidewalk and a wall being repaired
is less than one-half the building's height.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ms. Fink said, a permit must be obtained from the
department before any sidewalk shed is erected.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Epstein, a Manhattan engineer, said that his advice to
clients is to erect shedding _ a ``construction bridge'' in
industry jargon _ at the moment the property owner or board becomes
aware of any unsafe condition relating to the building facade.
</P>
<P>
   ``A common mistake that owners make is to wait until the work
begins to put up the bridging,'' Epstein said. ``But I tell them
that as soon as they know there's a problem, the bridge should go
up immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Epstein added that the administrative code does not limit the
requirement for sheds to sidewalks alone. ``You need to protect any
areas that are not totally locked off,'' he said, explaining that
if waterproofing work is being done in the rear of a building, for
example, bridging must be constructed if the area is accessible,
even if the only people who might be in the area are residents or
building employees.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Bellet, president of Bellet Construction in Manhattan,
said that for buildings 100 feet or more in height, sidewalk sheds
must also extend 20 feet beyond the walls of the building being
repaired, even if that means that the extended part of the shed
ends up in front of an adjacent property.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to notify the next-door neighbor,'' Bellet said.
``But you don't need his permission.''
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, Bellet said, property owners think of sidewalk
sheds when they are doing facade restoration or waterproofing work.
But owners should also check with their lawyer or engineer to
determine whether a shed is necessary for things like window
replacement or other exterior repair work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are occasions when a sidewalk shed costs more than the
work itself,'' Bellet said. ``But if what you're doing has any
possibility of hurting somebody on the ground, a shed should go
up.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The cost of an 8-foot-high sidewalk shed just a few years ago
averaged around $45 a linear foot, Bellet said. Today, however, the
cost can be as high as $125 per foot. In addition to the
installation cost, he said, most companies that build sheds also
charge a monthly fee after the first three months.
</P>
<P>
   Samson, the co-op lawyer, said that boards and owners should
also strive to minimize problems that a shed might cause for
residents or businesses.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, for second- and third-floor tenants who
have concerns about security problems posed by a shed, it might be
wise to install security cameras or razor wire to discourage access
to the top of the shed. In addition, he said, it is frequently
worth the expense to have exposed surfaces of the shed painted or
even decorated and to insure that lighting under the shed is not
only adequate, but vandal proof.
</P>
<P>
   It might also be appropriate for a building with ground-floor
commercial tenants to construct a shed that is 16 feet high instead
of the standard 8 feet. An alternative, he said, would be to help
such businesses pay for signs advertising their business and then
mount the signs on the exterior of the shed. Finally, Samson said,
the best thing a board can do to make life easier for residents and
businesses when a shed is necessary is to insure that it comes down
as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Once you get a sidewalk bridge in front of your property, your
No. 1 priority is getting the contractor on the fast track,'' he
said. ``Because nothing good is going to happen while that bridge
is up.''

SOME OFFICE BUILDING OWNERS FIND IT A GOOD TIME TO SELL 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JOHN HOLUSHA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The 42-story office building at 1185 Avenue of the
Americas, between 46th and 47th Streets, has to be considered a
trophy property because of its location, its roll of high quality
tenants and its direct underground connections to Rockefeller
Center and several subway lines.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the leases on large portions of the building are
due to expire over the next few years, with the new leases at
higher current market rates replacing those signed when the real
estate market was soft and tenants commanded low rates and big
concessions packages. It is almost completely rented, with only one
25,000-square-foot block of space available, and rents are expected
to keep rising in Manhattan for several more years because of the
booming economy and demand for space.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the family that controls the building has put it up
for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with the run-up in values over the last few years, some
investors who bought distressed properties in the early part of
this decade are looking to lock in their profits by selling or
refinancing their buildings.
</P>
<P>
   As James Kuhn, the president of Newmark Realty Advisors, put it
recently, ``We are advising our clients that if they are not
long-term holders of real estate, now is a great time to take a few
chips off the table.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that office vacancies are declining, interest rates are
low, capital is available and capital gains tax treatment is less
onerous with the repeal of New York state's so-called Cuomo tax of
10 percent on sales of over $1 million and the lowering of federal
tax rates, making transactions more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   The state gains tax was considered particularly onerous, real
estate executives said, because it was triggered by events not
normally taxable, such as the acquisition of property by an
investment trust shielded from federal taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Kuhn said it would be foolish for a property owner to try to
wait to sell at the very peak of the market, because peaks are hard
to spot and the downside is steep. ``When the market corrects, it
corrects quickly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, this is a good time to sell, but it is also a good time
to buy, depending on your investment objectives,'' said Jeffrey
Cooper, a senior director at Cushman &AMP; Wakefield's financial
services group. ``With capital available at 7 percent, it is a good
time to sell. But with rents headed up at good buildings in midtown
and downtown, it is a good time to invest in Class A and high B
buildings if you are a long-term investor.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Goldenberg, president of Sylvan Lawrence Co., said there
is one right answer when to buy and sell. ``Indeed, there is a
theory that well-located real estate should never be sold, but
passed down to subsequent generations.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he conceded that this was a luxury theory and that
harsh reality often does not permit such smooth transfers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The 1.1 million-square-foot building at 1185 Avenue of the
Americas that is now up for sale was purchased in 1977 by a private
investors' syndicate, whose general partners are Peter and Anthony
Malkin, and it has been managed and marketed since by the family's
operating company, W&AMP;M Properties.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 1995, the owners began a major upgrade to the
building, replacing the roof, installing new controls on the
high-rise elevators and refurbishing all the elevator cabs. The
lobby was upgraded and the bathrooms were revised to meet standards
for the disabled and the facade was examined and repaired as
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, the air-conditioning and electrical capacity
were increased and fiber-optic telecommunications lines installed.
Although it was erected in 1972 _ to be the headquarters of the
company that is now Westpoint Stevens _ W&AMP;M is marketing it as
Class A space because of the improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Malkin, president of W&AMP;M, said the decision to offer the
building for sale was strategic. Because there is a clear
opportunity to increase income from rents, he said, the building
should be attractive to real estate investment trusts and other
institutional investors seeking secure income. ``We anticipate that
people will pay us a portion of the value they will be able to
create,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest leases are expiring between 2003 and 2005, W&AMP;M
officials said, with 14{ floors becoming available for releasing.
</P>
<P>
   Selling the building, which could fetch several hundred dollars
a square foot if recent sales are any indication, will enable the
Malkin family to redeploy its capital after syndicate partners have
been paid their proportionate shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last 10 years we have been buying distressed assets,
fixing them up, renting them and financing them,'' he said. In the
process, W&AMP;M has built up an in-house engineering, construction,
acquisition and finance capability, which would not be of much use
in a building that has already been upgraded and is almost fully
occupied.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can take the capital from this building and invest it in
five or six other properties,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although sales prices of top quality office buildings have
recovered sharply in recent years, they are still below those of
the 1980s, said Daniel McNulty, president of Rockwood Realty
Associates, which is marketing 1185. ``Nine years ago, Class A
space was selling for about $400 a square foot,'' he said. ``Now it
is around $300 a foot not adjusted for inflation, so we are well
south of the past peak.''
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that the lack of construction for most of this
decade would provide support for rental rates and building sales
that was not present in the last market cycle. During that time, 30
million square feet of office space was added to the Manhattan
market, he said. ``That is not going to happen in the next 15-year
cycle.''
</P>
<P>
   Another way of realizing cash from a building is refinancing, an
alternative that allows an owner to capitalize on the value of a
property, but adds a big obligation to the lender that might be
hard to sustain if the market weakens and rents start to slip.
That, essentially, is what happened at Rockefeller Center, real
estate executives say. The companies operating the center were
unable to meet debt payments and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in
1995. A group led by Tishman Speyer Properties bought control of
the buildings east of Avenue of the Americas in 1996.

YANKS KEEP CLOSING IN ON THEIR 100TH VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The sky over Yankee Stadium has stopped falling, and
the ball park's principle inhabitants have resumed the business of
historic pursuit. The New York Yankees have now won four
consecutive games after mauling Seattle by 11-6 Saturday, scoring
all their runs in the first four innings.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Pettitte pitched well enough to earn his 15th victory, and
Bernie Williams and Derek Jeter each had three hits. The Yankees'
four-game losing streak seems like nothing but a bad memory now, a
frightening night terror that was not as real as it appeared.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are 98-36, just two victories away from 100, with
one game and two days remaining in August. No team has won 100
games before Sept. 9; the 1906 Chicago Cubs and 1954 Cleveland
Indians _ the teams whose regular-season victory records are being
threatened by the Yankees _ set that standard.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees could clinch a playoff spot within 72 hours. With
their victory Saturday, the Yankees reduced their magic number for
the playoff spot to just three. The American League East title
could be wrapped up in the next week. Then, whether anyone will
admit it or not, the Yankees will chase longstanding regular-season
victory records.
</P>
<P>
   They need to win only 12 of their remaining 28 games to match
the 110 victories of the 1927 Yankees. The 1954 Indians won 111
games, the American League record. The major-league record of 116,
set by the 1906 Cubs, is possible. If the Yankees maintain their
current pace, they will win 118 games. But Joe Torre, the Yankees'
manager, intends to rest his everyday players regularly through the
last month.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have 28 games remaining, 17 in Yankee Stadium, where
they are 52-12. Half of the 28 games will come against clubs with
losing records, including six against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, an
expansion team; three against the Chicago White Sox, and one
against the Mariners, whom the Yankees have beaten in 8-of-10 games
this year.

<P>
   Seattle used to be the Yankees' nemesis, a relentless force that
outlasted David Cone and Jack McDowell in the 1995 playoffs. The
Mariners had so much hitting, they had Randy Johnson, and they had
Lou Piniella managing them. Piniella still resides in their dugout,
now two days beyond his 55th birthday, but the rest has changed.
Seattle has a sporadic and aging lineup, a pitching staff that
misses Johnson, and, near the end of an extremely disappointing
season, not much in the way of vital signs. No pulse, no blood
pressure, and as long as the Yankees put them away quickly, no
chance.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, the Yankees scored five runs in the first
inning against Seattle's Paul Spoljaric, ensuring the Mariners'
white flag by the sixth inning. The Yankees disposed of the
Mariners with even more alacrity Saturday: after scoring a run in
the first, the Yankees added five more in the second and another in
the third. Yankees 7, Mariners 0, and Seattle wasn't bothering
holding the Yankees at first base. In gym class or in some baseball
leagues, this would have been deemed a skunk and been concluded
prematurely, with both sides then going their separate ways.
</P>
<P>
   But they played on, the Yankees adding four runs in the fourth,
going about the business of padding their numbers, which are
staggering:
</P>
<P>
   _ Jeter had three hits and surpassed his good friend Alex
Rodriguez for the league lead in that category; Jeter has 175 hits,
Rodriguez 174.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jeter scored four runs, for a total of 109, which leads the
league.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bernie Williams drove in four runs with three hits. Williams
missed more than a month after spraining his knee, but he has 81
RBIs and, at this rate, will drive in more than 100 runs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Darryl Strawberry bashed his 23rd homer of the season. He hit
a total of 28 in the major leagues from 1992-97.
</P>
<P>
   Both managers removed regulars in the final innings, Luis Sojo
and Homer Bush replacing Jeter and Chuck Knoblauch, and Raul Ibanez
replacing Ken Griffey Jr. for Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' victory was tarnished somewhat in the late innings,
when Seattle scored enough runs to make the crowd grumble. Pettitte
allowed four of the five runs Seattle scored in the seventh. Coming
off two solid outings, Mike Stanton replaced Pettitte and promptly
took a step backward, giving up three hits and a run in the
seventh, then allowing a single and a walk to start the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH:
</P>
<P>
   Before Saturday's game, Yankees Manager Joe Torre asked
reporters why Ken Griffey Jr., is being booed thickly at Yankee
Stadium. Told that it was because the Seattle center fielder said
he would never play for the Yankees, Torre nodded in understanding.
The booing worsened Saturday, and Griffey, who has acknowledged
that boos at the All-Star Game prompted him to change his mind and
participate in the home run derby, seemed bothered by the negative
reinforcement, throwing his helmet angrily after striking out in
the third inning. Batting in the sixth, however, Griffey slammed
his 45th home run into the right-field stands and enjoyed a
leisurely trip around the bases, some fans cheering him, others
jeering. ... Alex Rodriguez hit a two-run homer in the seventh, the
38th home run of the season for the Seattle shortstop.

REAL ESTATE: BUILDINGS TIGHTENING THE LEASH ON DOGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOYCE COHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In this dog-eat-dog real-estate market, it's no
surprise that dogs are having a tough time.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of buildings ban dogs outright. Others impose conditions,
written or unwritten: Fido rides in the freight car, Toto gets
toted through the lobby, Rover requires a big security deposit,
Balto had better not bark.
</P>
<P>
   Though no one keeps formal track, dog policies _ whether in
rentals, co-ops or condominiums _ tend to loosen and tighten along
with the market. And the current market is about as tight as it has
ever been.
</P>
<P>
   Buildings are ``slowly making more restrictive policies,'' said
Gregory Carlson, president of the Federation of New York Housing
Cooperatives. ``Now that buildings are not having any vacancy
problems, they can be more discriminatory about who they let in.''
A spate of news stories about scary dogs doesn't help, said Carlson
_ nor do inconsiderate dog owners who fail to clean up after their
dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Finding co-ops for her dog-owning clients has become
increasingly difficult, said Madeleine Dale, a real-estate broker
for Douglas Elliman West Side. ``The rules have been very strict,
and tightening over the last five years,'' she said. ``We have
become even more crowded. There is very little space, and scarce
resources prompt a lot of battling.''
</P>
<P>
   Though brokers try to keep up with buildings' dog policies, the
policies change often _ sometimes after turnover on a co-op board,
sometimes after a problem with an existing dog, sometimes for no
apparent reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boards have gotten very picky,'' said Ms. Dale, who has a
75-pound Scottish deerhound named Layla. ``We have very few
properties to offer and I think the boards sense their power. They
don't have to have any reason at all when they decline you.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting into a rental can be even tougher. There are always
dog-loving buildings, of course. Ms. Dale rents an apartment in the
Apthorp at Broadway and 79th Street, a building so dog-friendly
that the staff keeps biscuits on hand for dogs returning from their
walks. And some landlords encourage dog ownership for security
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with worries about incessant barking, odiferous dog
droppings and damage to the building, a landlord will almost always
take a non-dog-owning tenant over a dog owner, said Brian Edwards,
director of leasing for Halstead Property Co. ``When buildings were
hurting for tenants in the early 1990s, pet policies were much more
forgiving,'' he said. ``Now it's canine non grata.''
</P>
<P>
   Though some buildings have blanket no-pet rules, these in fact
tend to be no-dog policies, say lawyers and those who deal with pet
issues. Cats and other stay-at-home animals may never even emerge
from the apartment. ``Practically speaking, unless a cat is let out
of a dwelling unit or you have an odor emanating from the
apartment, you're fighting something you don't know about,'' said
Carlson, the co-op federation president.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem with cat ownership tends to be drains
clogged by kitty litter, which clumps when wet. Only on isolated
occasions are there problems with outlawed animals, which include
wild animals, endangered species and farm animals kept in built-up
areas of the city.
</P>
<P>
   But even as it gets harder for dog owners to find a new home, it
may be easier for them to remain there once they do. No-pet clauses
on leases for rental apartments are largely unenforceable, say
lawyers who deal with pet issues. Laws come down squarely on the
side of the pet-owning inhabitant, and proposed legislation in the
City Council would make it even easier to keep a pet.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, New York is exceedingly dog-friendly. Manhattan
features 15 public dog runs, plus plenty of services for the
metropolitan mutt: doggie day camp, obedience school, grooming
parlors. Studies indicate that pets enhance emotional health and
provide needed companionship in single-person households, which are
legion in New York. And dogs, being socially uninhibited, let their
owners engage with their urban neighbors in ways they never do when
they're unaccompanied by their animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``In buildings with lots of pets there's a lot of interaction
among people,'' said Dr. Peter Borchelt, an animal behaviorist at
the Animal Medical Center. ``Everyone knows each other because of
the pets. You now have a happier building. If you insist on having
no pet problems because you insist on having no pets, you are going
to have a different type of building.''
</P>
<P>
   And when it comes time to sell? It's easier to sell a unit in a
building that permits dogs, said Mitchell Speer, an associate
broker at William B. May Co. Even buyers without dogs often prefer
to buy in a dog-friendly building, he said. ``What if someone wants
to pay them full asking price and has a dog?'' Speer said. ``If the
building restricts dogs, you're cutting out a major proportion of
the buying market.''
</P>
<P>
   For buyers who do have a dog, the dog policy is often the
deal-breaker when it comes to housing decisions. ``People are more
willing to pay a higher price or look forever or buy an apartment
they thought wasn't perfect,'' said Christine O'Neal, a Halstead
broker. Twice recently, she said, she sold apartments solely
because they allowed a dog. Both cases involved a bidding war.
``They were willing to go up just to get the dog in,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto Shayo certainly is. Because of Kita, his 7-pound poodle
mix, he has had a frustrating, and so far unsuccessful, search to
rent a unit in a full-service condominium building on the East
Side. ``It is a very harsh, hostile environment,'' he said. ``I
always tell them upfront about the dog, but because the market is
tight now, they are no longer OK with dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Shayo, an art dealer, has expanded his search boundaries as well
as his price range. ``What can I do?'' he said. ``I am desperate.''
</P>
<P>
   Dogs, unlike cats or other pets, inhabit the public space. They
walk in and out, ride up and down, and make loud noises. They also
lunge and snap, sniff impolitely, snuffle their noses in the baby
carriage, come eye to eye with toddlers, shed on the carpet, and
shake off vigorously after romping through the rain. These are
things neighbors don't necessarily like to be subjected to in their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Dog restrictions are intended to achieve a happy medium. Some
buildings say dogs must be carried when in the elevator and in the
lobby. Others make dogs ride in the service elevator when it's
available _ a practice some owners find insulting. Often if a human
is on the elevator and doesn't want to ride with a dog, the dog
waits.
</P>
<P>
   Some buildings limit a dog's size, though animal experts say
this policy is wrongheaded. ``Larger dogs make better apartment
dogs _ they don't require as much activity,'' said Jody Jones,
director of adoptions for the Center for Animal Care and Control,
which functions as the city's dog pound. ``A 125-pound mastiff will
lie around and sleep all day. Smaller dogs are more yippy and run
all over the furniture.''

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some buildings also restrict the number of dogs per apartment.
At the Bamford, at 333 East 56th St., for example, tenants can have
up to two dogs, each weighing 15 pounds or less _ but the
dog-owning household must reside in a two-bedroom apartment or
larger.
</P>
<P>
   Other buildings are leery of breeds reputed to be aggressive,
like pit bulls and Rottweilers.
</P>
<P>
   Many buildings have a grandfather policy that permits existing
dogs to stay but prohibits new dogs _ a practice that often leads
to accusations of unfairness from those who see their neighbors
with dogs but can't have dogs themselves. Real estate agents tell
of cases where a deceased dog has been replaced, discreetly, with a
look-alike pooch.
</P>
<P>
   A grand urban legend has it that some co-op boards interview
dogs along with their owners. That hardly ever happens _ ``only on
an individual basis or for a special concern,'' said Iris Palley, a
broker for Douglas Elliman East Side who specializes in finding
apartments for dog owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no co-op that says you have to bring the dog to the
interview,'' said Ms. Palley, who owns a poodle named Alice and
also designs and sells barrettes for dogs with topknots. ``The
exception is if you have a lot of dogs or if your dog is enormous,
like a little pony.''
</P>
<P>
   It's more common for a co-op board to require some material
about the dog, she said _ information on its breed and weight;
references from a veterinarian, groomer, trainer or neighbor;
perhaps a photograph.
</P>
<P>
   In a very few cases, though, the manager or superintendent
screens the dog. At New York Towers, a large postwar co-op at 305
East 24th St. that lifted its dog ban nearly four years ago, the
on-site manager, Steve Nardoni, meets all incoming dogs. He sees
about three a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes five minutes,'' said Nardoni, whose own dog, a poodle
named Max, occasionally accompanies him to work. ``The board
doesn't want me to put the dog through a psychiatric drill. I think
responsible dog owners understand that in a cooperative community
there are certain things they have to go through.''
</P>
<P>
   One dog that passed the screen _ actually, Nardoni has never
rejected a dog _ was Brownie, a cocker spaniel owned by Izumi
Hayashi and her husband, Frank Pupo. ``They wanted to make sure the
dog is not loud, noisy, scary-looking and all that stuff,'' said
Ms. Hayashi, a financial analyst who moved in three years ago. ``He
pretty much just wagged the tail and walked around and gave
everybody some kisses, and that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nardoni also checked out Zoe, a shepherd mix acquired by
long-time residents Pearl and John Harrington shortly after the
building began allowing dogs. ``Since we were able to be with her,
if there was any problem, we could correct it,'' said Mrs.
Harrington, who works from home. The Harringtons trained Zoe so
that ``when she gets into the elevator she will go into a corner
and sit,'' said Mrs. Harrington.
</P>
<P>
   One 85-unit co-op in the East 60s that intends to lift its
no-dog policy will not require a screening but does plan to
institute extensive written rules. (The manager would describe the
plans only if the building was not identified, because the board
has not yet approved the policy.)
</P>
<P>
   The proposed policy states that dog owners will pay additional
maintenance of $50 a month and put down a $1,000 security deposit.
Dogs would have to be leashed when on common property and use the
service elevator, even on weekends and holidays. Dog-related
garbage would have to be bagged and placed in the incinerator, with
dog-food cans rinsed and recycled. Dogs could not be groomed in the
hallway. Repeated complaints by other shareholders would be grounds
for a fine and, eventually, eviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Younger people are moving into the building and seem to want
dogs,'' the manager said. The board is ``trying to formulate
something that works for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Accusations can fly when a board starts enforcing a previously
ignored ban. That apparently happened to Judith McQuown, who six
years ago bought a garden apartment expressly because she was
planning to get a dog. ``I asked whether dogs were permitted, and
pointed out that was why I bought a garden apartment,'' said Ms.
McQuown, a writer of business books who lives at 315 East 72nd St.,
a postwar co-op. ``I was assured yes, this was a dog building.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years after Ms. McQuown acquired a stray Scottish terrier,
Hamish, she began receiving letters accusing her of harboring a dog
in violation of the rules, she said. ``They started attaching late
fees to my maintenance payments and hitting me with legal fees,''
she said. After she hired a lawyer, the board backed off. Now, with
new members on the board, dogs are allowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as people aren't complaining about your dogs in terms
of noise or safety, people are left alone,'' said William Boak, the
current president of the co-op board and owner of a yellow Labrador
retriever named Scout. But now that dogs are allowed, he said,
``we've had a proliferation of dogs,'' with nearly 50 of them in
the 218-unit building.
</P>
<P>
   Because the building has grown so dog-dense, the board is
considering formalizing the dog policy, Boak said. This might
include a point system for bad behavior, so if a dog racks up a
certain number of points, it would be subject to eviction.
</P>
<P>
   An abrupt change in policy also angered Andrew Visconti of 23
West 73rd St., owner of an English bulldog named Petunia. A year
and a half ago, the building, which had no policy on dogs, outlawed
four large breeds as well as pit bulls, and required dog owners to
maintain personal liability insurance for at least $500,000, among
other things, said Craig Wilson, a member of the co-op board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five hundred thousand dollars is outrageously high,'' said
Visconti, who sent Petunia to obedience school at the age of four
months. ``I don't like the feeling of being a renter with the
landlord telling me what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Much ill will ensued, along with several formal and informal
meetings among interested parties.
</P>
<P>
   Visconti is looking to move, partly because he is disgusted with
the dog episode. ``It creates policing,'' said Visconti, a
correspondent for an Italian newspaper syndicate. ``If it's a
problem that a dog might have an accident, it is the same as
someone taking the garbage to the garbage area and the bag is
leaking and grease gets on the carpeting. Are we going to start
assessing fines for that? The assumption is that dog owners are
dirty, irresponsible people who abuse the patience of our
neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dog waste, for sure, is a sensitive and delicate problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's dog has had an accident,'' said Charlotte Reed,
owner of the pet-care service Two Dogs &AMP; A Goat. ``It happens.
That's what having a dog is. The considerate dog owner is going to
clean up after the dog or tell the doorman, tell the super.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is considerate. Winter is a bad time of year at
the Fairview, a building at 61-20 Grand Central Parkway in Forest
Hills, Queens, which has a large indoor garage. ``If it's cold out,
they let the dog do its business in the garage or the stairwells,''
said Carlson of the co-op federation, who is also the building's
manager. It happens about a dozen times each winter, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's barking _ a particular problem in postwar
buildings, where sound is likely to resonate. ``The neighbors don't
give you much time to deal with it,'' said Dr. Laura Robbins, a
veterinarian at the Center for Veterinary Care. ``People will get
nasty letters under their door immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Though proper training can fix almost any problem, it usually
takes a few weeks. For those needing quicker solutions, there are
anti-bark collars, anti-anxiety medications and, as a last resort,
vocal-cord removal.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers say the recent changes in rent regulations, which allow
for substantial increases when the lease turns over, provide an
incentive for landlords to try to evict longtime renters. Pets can
be a handy excuse. But except when it comes to nuisance pets _ ones
that create ongoing, persistent problems, like nonstop noise _ the
law tends to be on the pet owner's side.
</P>
<P>
   Section 27-2009.1 of the Administrative Code of the City of New
York, often called the pet law, has been in effect since 1983. Not
coincidentally, the law dates from another time when the
real-estate market was tight, said Elinor Molbegott, who at that
time was counsel to the ASPCA and helped promote the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The pet law says that if a tenant has harbored a pet ``openly
and notoriously'' for at least three months, any no-pet regulations
in multiple-dwelling leases are deemed waived and unenforceable. In
other words, an owner or landlord who knows about a pet must file
eviction papers within three months of gaining ``knowledge'' of the
animal. Otherwise, the animal can stay.
</P>
<P>
   The pet law supersedes a co-op's own no-pet rules, says Stuart
Saft, chairman of the Council of New York Co-operatives. Even if a
co-op's board has banned dogs, he said, ``The courts have provided
that the pet law applies.'' Co-op shareholders are tenants within
the meaning of the law, he said, and ``the proprietary lease is
subject to the law, and the law says you have to move within three
months to evict the pet.''
</P>
<P>
   Under proposed city legislation, pet owners would gain even more
rights. Anyone over age 62 would be entitled to keep a pet. And the
three-month window for eviction would apply to the first pet only,
not to replacement pets.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, it would grandfather not just a pet but the right to
have a pet, said Darryl Vernon, a lawyer who deals with pet issues.
A grandfather clause that lets existing pets stay but doesn't let
them be replaced ``is a terrible policy,'' said Vernon. ``You have
elderly people, home alone, with no more pets.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Fair Housing Act is also invoked on behalf of pet
owners, said Karen Copeland, another lawyer who deals with pet
issues. It says that people with disabilities _ any mental or
physical impairments _ are entitled to reasonable accommodation.
That can include a pet that is medically necessary, said Ms.
Copeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows a blind person can keep a dog, but so can
someone with chronic depression or an invisible disability,'' she
said. ``I have a client with a chronic lung disease, and the pet
keeps her calm and helps keep her from reverting to a smoking
habit.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's pet law constitutes ``a fairly easy defense, but it's
not clear-cut,'' said Ms. Copeland. For example, it applies to
co-ops and rentals citywide, and to condominiums in Brooklyn,
Queens and Staten Island. But it doesn't apply to condominiums in
Manhattan and the Bronx. That's because the pet law covers only
lease agreements, and _ in the opinion of the Appellate Court
covering Manhattan and the Bronx _ the owner-board relationship
does not constitute a lease agreement.
</P>
<P>
   People who violate a building's dog restrictions by having a
too-big dog, say, or too many dogs, would also be protected by the
pet law, lawyers said. But if they flout a rule that dogs use the
freight elevator? Such a situation has not been tested in the
courts, lawyers said, and it's unclear whether such a rule would be
enforceable.
</P>
<P>
   ``A shareholder is wise to follow such a policy'' in case the
dog ``does foul carpet in the passenger elevator'' and is accused
of being a nuisance, said Arthur Weinstein, a lawyer who is vice
president of the Council of New York Cooperatives, but it's unclear
``whether the co-op can enforce such a restriction without any
negative conduct by the animal.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Copeland told of one client who kept a poodle in her
Manhattan co-op: ``They desperately wanted her to use the freight
elevator, but she said nix to that.'' The case was settled out of
court. ``She's still taking the front elevator,'' Ms. Copeland
said.

REAL ESTATE: BUILDINGS TIGHTENING THE LEASH ON DOGS

   NEW YORK _ In this dog-eat-dog real-estate market, it's no
surprise that dogs are having a tough time.

metropolitan mutt: doggie day camp, obedience school, grooming
parlors. Studies indicate that pets enhance emotional health and
provide needed companionship in single-person households, which are
legion in New York. And dogs, being socially uninhibited, let their
owners engage with their urban neighbors in ways they never do when
they're unaccompanied by their animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``In buildings with lots of pets there's a lot of interaction
among people,'' said Dr. Peter Borchelt, an animal behaviorist at
the Animal Medical Center. ``Everyone knows each other because of
the pets. You now have a happier building. If you insist on having
no pet problems because you insist on having no pets, you are going
to have a different type of building.''
</P>
<P>
   And when it comes time to sell? It's easier to sell a unit in a
building that permits dogs, said Mitchell Speer, an associate
broker at William B. May Co. Even buyers without dogs often prefer
to buy in a dog-friendly building, he said. ``What if someone wants
to pay them full asking price and has a dog?'' Speer said. ``If the
building restricts dogs, you're cutting out a major proportion of
the buying market.''
</P>
<P>
   For buyers who do have a dog, the dog policy is often the
deal-breaker when it comes to housing decisions. ``People are more
willing to pay a higher price or look forever or buy an apartment
they thought wasn't perfect,'' said Christine O'Neal, a Halstead
broker. Twice recently, she said, she sold apartments solely
because they allowed a dog. Both cases involved a bidding war.
``They were willing to go up just to get the dog in,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto Shayo certainly is. Because of Kita, his 7-pound poodle
mix, he has had a frustrating, and so far unsuccessful, search to
rent a unit in a full-service condominium building on the East
Side. ``It is a very harsh, hostile environment,'' he said. ``I
always tell them upfront about the dog, but because the market is
tight now, they are no longer OK with dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Shayo, an art dealer, has expanded his search boundaries as well
as his price range. ``What can I do?'' he said. ``I am desperate.''
</P>
<P>
   Dogs, unlike cats or other pets, inhabit the public space. They
walk in and out, ride up and down, and make loud noises. They also
lunge and snap, sniff impolitely, snuffle their noses in the baby
carriage, come eye to eye with toddlers, shed on the carpet, and
shake off vigorously after romping through the rain. These are
things neighbors don't necessarily like to be subjected to in their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Dog restrictions are intended to achieve a happy medium. Some
buildings say dogs must be carried when in the elevator and in the
lobby. Others make dogs ride in the service elevator when it's
available _ a practice some owners find insulting. Often if a human
is on the elevator and doesn't want to ride with a dog, the dog
waits.
</P>
<P>
   Some buildings limit a dog's size, though animal experts say
this policy is wrongheaded. ``Larger dogs make better apartment
dogs _ they don't require as much activity,'' said Jody Jones,
director of adoptions for the Center for Animal Care and Control,
which functions as the city's dog pound. ``A 125-pound mastiff will
lie around and sleep all day. Smaller dogs are more yippy and run
all over the furniture.''

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some buildings also restrict the number of dogs per apartment.
At the Bamford, at 333 East 56th St., for example, tenants can have
up to two dogs, each weighing 15 pounds or less _ but the
dog-owning household must reside in a two-bedroom apartment or
larger.
</P>
<P>
   Other buildings are leery of breeds reputed to be aggressive,
like pit bulls and Rottweilers.
</P>
<P>
   Many buildings have a grandfather policy that permits existing
dogs to stay but prohibits new dogs _ a practice that often leads
to accusations of unfairness from those who see their neighbors
with dogs but can't have dogs themselves. Real estate agents tell
of cases where a deceased dog has been replaced, discreetly, with a
look-alike pooch.
</P>
<P>
   A grand urban legend has it that some co-op boards interview
dogs along with their owners. That hardly ever happens _ ``only on
an individual basis or for a special concern,'' said Iris Palley, a
broker for Douglas Elliman East Side who specializes in finding
apartments for dog owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no co-op that says you have to bring the dog to the
interview,'' said Ms. Palley, who owns a poodle named Alice and
also designs and sells barrettes for dogs with topknots. ``The
exception is if you have a lot of dogs or if your dog is enormous,
like a little pony.''
</P>
<P>
   It's more common for a co-op board to require some material
about the dog, she said _ information on its breed and weight;
references from a veterinarian, groomer, trainer or neighbor;
perhaps a photograph.
</P>
<P>
   In a very few cases, though, the manager or superintendent
screens the dog. At New York Towers, a large postwar co-op at 305
East 24th St. that lifted its dog ban nearly four years ago, the
on-site manager, Steve Nardoni, meets all incoming dogs. He sees
about three a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes five minutes,'' said Nardoni, whose own dog, a poodle
named Max, occasionally accompanies him to work. ``The board
doesn't want me to put the dog through a psychiatric drill. I think
responsible dog owners understand that in a cooperative community
there are certain things they have to go through.''
</P>
<P>
   One dog that passed the screen _ actually, Nardoni has never
rejected a dog _ was Brownie, a cocker spaniel owned by Izumi
Hayashi and her husband, Frank Pupo. ``They wanted to make sure the
dog is not loud, noisy, scary-looking and all that stuff,'' said
Ms. Hayashi, a financial analyst who moved in three years ago. ``He
pretty much just wagged the tail and walked around and gave
everybody some kisses, and that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nardoni also checked out Zoe, a shepherd mix acquired by
long-time residents Pearl and John Harrington shortly after the
building began allowing dogs. ``Since we were able to be with her,
if there was any problem, we could correct it,'' said Mrs.
Harrington, who works from home. The Harringtons trained Zoe so
that ``when she gets into the elevator she will go into a corner
and sit,'' said Mrs. Harrington.
</P>
<P>
   One 85-unit co-op in the East 60s that intends to lift its
no-dog policy will not require a screening but does plan to
institute extensive written rules. (The manager would describe the
plans only if the building was not identified, because the board
has not yet approved the policy.)
</P>
<P>
   The proposed policy states that dog owners will pay additional
maintenance of $50 a month and put down a $1,000 security deposit.
Dogs would have to be leashed when on common property and use the
service elevator, even on weekends and holidays. Dog-related
garbage would have to be bagged and placed in the incinerator, with
dog-food cans rinsed and recycled. Dogs could not be groomed in the
hallway. Repeated complaints by other shareholders would be grounds
for a fine and, eventually, eviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Younger people are moving into the building and seem to want
dogs,'' the manager said. The board is ``trying to formulate
something that works for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Accusations can fly when a board starts enforcing a previously
ignored ban. That apparently happened to Judith McQuown, who six
years ago bought a garden apartment expressly because she was
planning to get a dog. ``I asked whether dogs were permitted, and
pointed out that was why I bought a garden apartment,'' said Ms.
McQuown, a writer of business books who lives at 315 East 72nd St.,
a postwar co-op. ``I was assured yes, this was a dog building.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years after Ms. McQuown acquired a stray Scottish terrier,
Hamish, she began receiving letters accusing her of harboring a dog
in violation of the rules, she said. ``They started attaching late
fees to my maintenance payments and hitting me with legal fees,''
she said. After she hired a lawyer, the board backed off. Now, with
new members on the board, dogs are allowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as people aren't complaining about your dogs in terms
of noise or safety, people are left alone,'' said William Boak, the
current president of the co-op board and owner of a yellow Labrador
retriever named Scout. But now that dogs are allowed, he said,
``we've had a proliferation of dogs,'' with nearly 50 of them in
the 218-unit building.
</P>
<P>
   Because the building has grown so dog-dense, the board is
considering formalizing the dog policy, Boak said. This might
include a point system for bad behavior, so if a dog racks up a
certain number of points, it would be subject to eviction.
</P>
<P>
   An abrupt change in policy also angered Andrew Visconti of 23
West 73rd St., owner of an English bulldog named Petunia. A year
and a half ago, the building, which had no policy on dogs, outlawed
four large breeds as well as pit bulls, and required dog owners to
maintain personal liability insurance for at least $500,000, among
other things, said Craig Wilson, a member of the co-op board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five hundred thousand dollars is outrageously high,'' said
Visconti, who sent Petunia to obedience school at the age of four
months. ``I don't like the feeling of being a renter with the
landlord telling me what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Much ill will ensued, along with several formal and informal
meetings among interested parties.
</P>
<P>
   Visconti is looking to move, partly because he is disgusted with
the dog episode. ``It creates policing,'' said Visconti, a
correspondent for an Italian newspaper syndicate. ``If it's a
problem that a dog might have an accident, it is the same as
someone taking the garbage to the garbage area and the bag is
leaking and grease gets on the carpeting. Are we going to start
assessing fines for that? The assumption is that dog owners are
dirty, irresponsible people who abuse the patience of our
neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dog waste, for sure, is a sensitive and delicate problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's dog has had an accident,'' said Charlotte Reed,
owner of the pet-care service Two Dogs &AMP; A Goat. ``It happens.
That's what having a dog is. The considerate dog owner is going to
clean up after the dog or tell the doorman, tell the super.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is considerate. Winter is a bad time of year at
the Fairview, a building at 61-20 Grand Central Parkway in Forest
Hills, Queens, which has a large indoor garage. ``If it's cold out,
they let the dog do its business in the garage or the stairwells,''
said Carlson of the co-op federation, who is also the building's
manager. It happens about a dozen times each winter, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's barking _ a particular problem in postwar
buildings, where sound is likely to resonate. ``The neighbors don't
give you much time to deal with it,'' said Dr. Laura Robbins, a
veterinarian at the Center for Veterinary Care. ``People will get
nasty letters under their door immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Though proper training can fix almost any problem, it usually
takes a few weeks. For those needing quicker solutions, there are
anti-bark collars, anti-anxiety medications and, as a last resort,
vocal-cord removal.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers say the recent changes in rent regulations, which allow
for substantial increases when the lease turns over, provide an
incentive for landlords to try to evict longtime renters. Pets can
be a handy excuse. But except when it comes to nuisance pets _ ones
that create ongoing, persistent problems, like nonstop noise _ the
law tends to be on the pet owner's side.
</P>
<P>
   Section 27-2009.1 of the Administrative Code of the City of New
York, often called the pet law, has been in effect since 1983. Not
coincidentally, the law dates from another time when the
real-estate market was tight, said Elinor Molbegott, who at that
time was counsel to the ASPCA and helped promote the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The pet law says that if a tenant has harbored a pet ``openly
and notoriously'' for at least three months, any no-pet regulations
in multiple-dwelling leases are deemed waived and unenforceable. In
other words, an owner or landlord who knows about a pet must file
eviction papers within three months of gaining ``knowledge'' of the
animal. Otherwise, the animal can stay.
</P>
<P>
   The pet law supersedes a co-op's own no-pet rules, says Stuart
Saft, chairman of the Council of New York Co-operatives. Even if a
co-op's board has banned dogs, he said, ``The courts have provided
that the pet law applies.'' Co-op shareholders are tenants within
the meaning of the law, he said, and ``the proprietary lease is
subject to the law, and the law says you have to move within three
months to evict the pet.''
</P>
<P>
   Under proposed city legislation, pet owners would gain even more
rights. Anyone over age 62 would be entitled to keep a pet. And the
three-month window for eviction would apply to the first pet only,
not to replacement pets.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, it would grandfather not just a pet but the right to
have a pet, said Darryl Vernon, a lawyer who deals with pet issues.
A grandfather clause that lets existing pets stay but doesn't let
them be replaced ``is a terrible policy,'' said Vernon. ``You have
elderly people, home alone, with no more pets.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Fair Housing Act is also invoked on behalf of pet
owners, said Karen Copeland, another lawyer who deals with pet
issues. It says that people with disabilities _ any mental or
physical impairments _ are entitled to reasonable accommodation.
That can include a pet that is medically necessary, said Ms.
Copeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows a blind person can keep a dog, but so can
someone with chronic depression or an invisible disability,'' she
said. ``I have a client with a chronic lung disease, and the pet
keeps her calm and helps keep her from reverting to a smoking
habit.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's pet law constitutes ``a fairly easy defense, but it's
not clear-cut,'' said Ms. Copeland. For example, it applies to
co-ops and rentals citywide, and to condominiums in Brooklyn,
Queens and Staten Island. But it doesn't apply to condominiums in
Manhattan and the Bronx. That's because the pet law covers only
lease agreements, and _ in the opinion of the Appellate Court
covering Manhattan and the Bronx _ the owner-board relationship
does not constitute a lease agreement.
</P>
<P>
   People who violate a building's dog restrictions by having a
too-big dog, say, or too many dogs, would also be protected by the
pet law, lawyers said. But if they flout a rule that dogs use the
freight elevator? Such a situation has not been tested in the
courts, lawyers said, and it's unclear whether such a rule would be
enforceable.
</P>
<P>
   ``A shareholder is wise to follow such a policy'' in case the
dog ``does foul carpet in the passenger elevator'' and is accused
of being a nuisance, said Arthur Weinstein, a lawyer who is vice
president of the Council of New York Cooperatives, but it's unclear
``whether the co-op can enforce such a restriction without any
negative conduct by the animal.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Copeland told of one client who kept a poodle in her
Manhattan co-op: ``They desperately wanted her to use the freight
elevator, but she said nix to that.'' The case was settled out of
court. ``She's still taking the front elevator,'' Ms. Copeland
said.

SOME OFFICE BUILDING OWNERS FIND IT A GOOD TIME TO SELL 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JOHN HOLUSHA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The 42-story office building at 1185 Avenue of the
Americas, between 46th and 47th Streets, has to be considered a
trophy property because of its location, its roll of high quality
tenants and its direct underground connections to Rockefeller
Center and several subway lines.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the leases on large portions of the building are
due to expire over the next few years, with the new leases at
higher current market rates replacing those signed when the real
estate market was soft and tenants commanded low rates and big
concessions packages. It is almost completely rented, with only one
25,000-square-foot block of space available, and rents are expected
to keep rising in Manhattan for several more years because of the
booming economy and demand for space.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the family that controls the building has put it up
for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with the run-up in values over the last few years, some
investors who bought distressed properties in the early part of
this decade are looking to lock in their profits by selling or
refinancing their buildings.
</P>
<P>
   As James Kuhn, the president of Newmark Realty Advisors, put it
recently, ``We are advising our clients that if they are not
long-term holders of real estate, now is a great time to take a few
chips off the table.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that office vacancies are declining, interest rates are
low, capital is available and capital gains tax treatment is less
onerous with the repeal of New York state's so-called Cuomo tax of
10 percent on sales of over $1 million and the lowering of federal
tax rates, making transactions more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   The state gains tax was considered particularly onerous, real
estate executives said, because it was triggered by events not
normally taxable, such as the acquisition of property by an
investment trust shielded from federal taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Kuhn said it would be foolish for a property owner to try to
wait to sell at the very peak of the market, because peaks are hard
to spot and the downside is steep. ``When the market corrects, it
corrects quickly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, this is a good time to sell, but it is also a good time
to buy, depending on your investment objectives,'' said Jeffrey
Cooper, a senior director at Cushman &AMP; Wakefield's financial
services group. ``With capital available at 7 percent, it is a good
time to sell. But with rents headed up at good buildings in midtown
and downtown, it is a good time to invest in Class A and high B
buildings if you are a long-term investor.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Goldenberg, president of Sylvan Lawrence Co., said there
is one right answer when to buy and sell. ``Indeed, there is a
theory that well-located real estate should never be sold, but
passed down to subsequent generations.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he conceded that this was a luxury theory and that
harsh reality often does not permit such smooth transfers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The 1.1 million-square-foot building at 1185 Avenue of the
Americas that is now up for sale was purchased in 1977 by a private
investors' syndicate, whose general partners are Peter and Anthony
Malkin, and it has been managed and marketed since by the family's
operating company, W&AMP;M Properties.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 1995, the owners began a major upgrade to the
building, replacing the roof, installing new controls on the
high-rise elevators and refurbishing all the elevator cabs. The
lobby was upgraded and the bathrooms were revised to meet standards
for the disabled and the facade was examined and repaired as
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, the air-conditioning and electrical capacity
were increased and fiber-optic telecommunications lines installed.
Although it was erected in 1972 _ to be the headquarters of the
company that is now Westpoint Stevens _ W&AMP;M is marketing it as
Class A space because of the improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Malkin, president of W&AMP;M, said the decision to offer the
building for sale was strategic. Because there is a clear
opportunity to increase income from rents, he said, the building
should be attractive to real estate investment trusts and other
institutional investors seeking secure income. ``We anticipate that
people will pay us a portion of the value they will be able to
create,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest leases are expiring between 2003 and 2005, W&AMP;M
officials said, with 14{ floors becoming available for releasing.
</P>
<P>
   Selling the building, which could fetch several hundred dollars
a square foot if recent sales are any indication, will enable the
Malkin family to redeploy its capital after syndicate partners have
been paid their proportionate shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last 10 years we have been buying distressed assets,
fixing them up, renting them and financing them,'' he said. In the
process, W&AMP;M has built up an in-house engineering, construction,
acquisition and finance capability, which would not be of much use
in a building that has already been upgraded and is almost fully
occupied.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can take the capital from this building and invest it in
five or six other properties,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although sales prices of top quality office buildings have
recovered sharply in recent years, they are still below those of
the 1980s, said Daniel McNulty, president of Rockwood Realty
Associates, which is marketing 1185. ``Nine years ago, Class A
space was selling for about $400 a square foot,'' he said. ``Now it
is around $300 a foot not adjusted for inflation, so we are well
south of the past peak.''
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that the lack of construction for most of this
decade would provide support for rental rates and building sales
that was not present in the last market cycle. During that time, 30
million square feet of office space was added to the Manhattan
market, he said. ``That is not going to happen in the next 15-year
cycle.''
</P>
<P>
   Another way of realizing cash from a building is refinancing, an
alternative that allows an owner to capitalize on the value of a
property, but adds a big obligation to the lender that might be
hard to sustain if the market weakens and rents start to slip.
That, essentially, is what happened at Rockefeller Center, real
estate executives say. The companies operating the center were
unable to meet debt payments and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in
1995. A group led by Tishman Speyer Properties bought control of
the buildings east of Avenue of the Americas in 1996.

WHY SHOULD A HI-RISE BUILD A SIDEWALK SHED? GRAVITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Section 27-1021 of the New York City Administrative
Code dictates when and how sidewalk sheds should be erected to
protect pedestrians when work is being done on the exterior of a
building.
</P>
<P>
   The laws of physics dictate why. Earlier this month, when a
48-square-foot section of masonry broke loose from a 40th-floor
wall of a building on Lexington Avenue between 46th and 47th
streets, scores of falling bricks ricocheted off a lower roof and
broke into thousands of fragments that rained down on pedestrians
and traffic. Two bricks that didn't disintegrate punched a
foot-wide hole in the roof of a commuter bus.
</P>
<P>
   While no one was injured _ despite the absence of a sidewalk
shed or sidewalk bridging _ the incident illustrates the subtleties
and risks involved with repairs or maintenance on high-rise
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``No building owner really wants to put up a sidewalk shed,''
said James Samson, a Manhattan lawyer who specializes in co-op and
condominium law. ``But hammers fall out of windows and bricks fall
out of walls, and when that happens, everybody starts pointing the
finger at everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Samson said that while sidewalk sheds are necessary to protect
the public, they present a host of problems for building owners.
The sheds are expensive to construct and unsightly, he said. They
can discourage sales of apartments in a building and hurt
commercial tenants whose businesses depend on visibility and
accessibility. Sidewalk sheds also raise security concerns, Samson
said, because they can expose second- and third-floor apartments to
a greater risk of burglary.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't believe how many buildings will do whatever they
can do to avoid having to put up a sidewalk shed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ilyse Fink, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of
Buildings, said the conditions under which sheds must be erected
are clear. According to the administrative code, a shed must be
constructed whenever any part of a facade more than 40 feet above
ground level is being altered or repaired, and when the distance
between the inside edge of the sidewalk and a wall being repaired
is less than one-half the building's height.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ms. Fink said, a permit must be obtained from the
department before any sidewalk shed is erected.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Epstein, a Manhattan engineer, said that his advice to
clients is to erect shedding _ a ``construction bridge'' in
industry jargon _ at the moment the property owner or board becomes
aware of any unsafe condition relating to the building facade.
</P>
<P>
   ``A common mistake that owners make is to wait until the work
begins to put up the bridging,'' Epstein said. ``But I tell them
that as soon as they know there's a problem, the bridge should go
up immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Epstein added that the administrative code does not limit the
requirement for sheds to sidewalks alone. ``You need to protect any
areas that are not totally locked off,'' he said, explaining that
if waterproofing work is being done in the rear of a building, for
example, bridging must be constructed if the area is accessible,
even if the only people who might be in the area are residents or
building employees.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Bellet, president of Bellet Construction in Manhattan,
said that for buildings 100 feet or more in height, sidewalk sheds
must also extend 20 feet beyond the walls of the building being
repaired, even if that means that the extended part of the shed
ends up in front of an adjacent property.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to notify the next-door neighbor,'' Bellet said.
``But you don't need his permission.''
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, Bellet said, property owners think of sidewalk
sheds when they are doing facade restoration or waterproofing work.
But owners should also check with their lawyer or engineer to
determine whether a shed is necessary for things like window
replacement or other exterior repair work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are occasions when a sidewalk shed costs more than the
work itself,'' Bellet said. ``But if what you're doing has any
possibility of hurting somebody on the ground, a shed should go
up.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The cost of an 8-foot-high sidewalk shed just a few years ago
averaged around $45 a linear foot, Bellet said. Today, however, the
cost can be as high as $125 per foot. In addition to the
installation cost, he said, most companies that build sheds also
charge a monthly fee after the first three months.
</P>
<P>
   Samson, the co-op lawyer, said that boards and owners should
also strive to minimize problems that a shed might cause for
residents or businesses.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, for second- and third-floor tenants who
have concerns about security problems posed by a shed, it might be
wise to install security cameras or razor wire to discourage access
to the top of the shed. In addition, he said, it is frequently
worth the expense to have exposed surfaces of the shed painted or
even decorated and to insure that lighting under the shed is not
only adequate, but vandal proof.
</P>
<P>
   It might also be appropriate for a building with ground-floor
commercial tenants to construct a shed that is 16 feet high instead
of the standard 8 feet. An alternative, he said, would be to help
such businesses pay for signs advertising their business and then
mount the signs on the exterior of the shed. Finally, Samson said,
the best thing a board can do to make life easier for residents and
businesses when a shed is necessary is to insure that it comes down
as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Once you get a sidewalk bridge in front of your property, your
No. 1 priority is getting the contractor on the fast track,'' he
said. ``Because nothing good is going to happen while that bridge
is up.''

 &HT;    CHERNOMYRDIN VOWS RUSSIA WILL NOT RETURN TO SOVIET PAST
 &HT;    Updates with status of government-parliament talks in grafs 2,
15-17.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW In remarks aimed at calming concerns of the United States
and other Western powers, acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin
vowed Saturday that Russia would not revert to its Soviet past as
it struggles with a deepening economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin also continued negotiations with the Communist-led
parliament on granting it more powers, while an ally of President
Boris Yeltsin said the parliament was no longer threatening to hold
up approval of the new prime minister until the power-sharing deal
was struck.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin has yet to unveil detailed plans of how to pull
Russia from its financial and political mire one week after his
surprise reappointment by Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and other Western lenders fear that Yeltsin
and Chernomyrdin will impose Soviet-style measures such as price
controls and printing more rubles in an effort to ease the economic
chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have already joined the world economy, and there will be no
return to the past,'' Chernomyrdin said on national television.
</P>
<P>
   He also sought to alleviate the fears of ordinary Russians, who
have seen the value of the ruble plummet 50 percent against the
U.S. dollar in the past two weeks as consumer prices rise. Many
banks are on the brink of collapse, sending panicked Russians
rushing to try to remove their deposits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have taken the decision to guarantee people's savings in
full. The government and the central bank are working out a
mechanism to carry out this decision,'' Chernomyrdin said.
</P>
<P>
   He also pledged to keep the ruble convertible on Russian and
world markets and to crack down on the illegal export of Western
currencies.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, scheduled to meet Yeltsin in a summit Tuesday
and Wednesday in Moscow, has urged Russia to continue to pursue the
free-market reforms begun after the Soviet Union disintegrated in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman called Chernomyrdin's statement Saturday
``encouraging,'' adding, ``they are going to continue on the path
of economic reform.''
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund, which assembled a $22.6 billion
bailout plan for Russia in July, has warned that further
installments of the package would be withheld should Russia enact
rigid state economic controls.
</P>
<P>
   IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus, who held emergency talks
with Chernomyrdin on Wednesday in Ukraine, warned that such
policies ``would inevitably lead to command economy methods and
hyperinflation, with consequent dire social consequences. This
would lead to disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   The interim government led by Chernomyrdin had earlier indicated
it would support Soviet-style economic measures in talks with the
opposition parliament, led by the Communists.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin and his acting prime minister appeared to be taking the
offensive as negotiations continued Saturday over the economic
plans and a proposed power-sharing arrangement between the
government and the Communist-dominated Duma, the lower house of
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Hours of talks ended without an agreement, and negotiations were
to resume Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Kotenkov, Yeltsin's envoy to the Duma, said the
Communists and other opponents were no longer insisting that they
be given new powers immediately. Instead, he said, the
power-sharing arrangement would be put in place under normal
legislative processes once Chernomyrdin and his cabinet were in
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order not to fuel tension, we would not immediately
consider specific amendments,'' Kotenkov told a news conference.
``We need a government now, and then we shall see.''
</P>
<P>
   The Duma is scheduled to begin the confirmation debate on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian newspaper Izvestia warned Saturday that the policies
being considered would lead Russia from ``crisis to collapse'' and
demonstrates the weakness of the Yeltsin regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It proposes initiatives which can only be called suicidal,''
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   The daily Russky Telegraf said Saturday that Yeltsin had been
reduced to a figurehead. Haggling between Chernomyrdin and the Duma
had created a dangerous political vacuum, it said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Russia today there is no definite center of power _ the
president has retreated from affairs and only carries out symbolic
functions like meeting foreign visitors,'' the paper said.
</P>
<P>
   Under intense pressure to resign, Yeltsin went on national
television Friday to declare that he would serve out his
presidential term, which ends in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party and other opposition factions continued its
calls for Yeltsin to step down.
</P>
<P>
   The political and economic situation in the country will force
Yeltsin to resign,'' said Valentin Kuptsov, deputy leader of the
Communists.

   ATTN: Mon, Aug. 31, is the one-year anniversary of the tragic
death of Britain's former Princess Diana. Cox European
correspondent Bert Roughton Jr., in the following package, takes a
look at her legacy, her eldest son, William and the status numerous
investigations surrounding her untimely death:
</P>
<P>
   DIANA-ANNIVERSARY _ LONDON _ A year after her tragic death in an
automobile accident in Paris, Princess Diana remains ``the people's
princess.'' She has come to represent an ideal of ordinary decency
to average English people, who consider her an icon they can relate
to. What's more, she has become an international symbol for people
around the world of charity, and class. A year later, it appears
her presence is a strong as ever as stories about her are in the
news weekly, and millions of dollars is given (and taken) in her
name daily. (Roughton, Cox News Service).

   DIANA-WILLIAM _ LONDON _ Prince William, Princess Di's eldest
son, is moving rapidly to fill the void in the public's imagination
left by his mother. Tall, good-looking and blessed with his
mother's features, he may actually be the first choice among the
British populace to ascend to the throne when his grandmother,
Queen Elizabeth passes away -- ahead of his well-known father,
Prince Charles, and uncle, Prince Andrew. (Roughton, Cox News
Service).
</P>
<P>
   DIANA-INVESTIGATION _ LONDON _ The automobile accident that
caused Princess Di's death has spawned numerous investigations, and
her death itself numerous lawsuits in different countries. Where we
are with these investigations and lawsuits? (Roughton, Cox News

commemorate the first anniversary of the death of Diana, Princess
of Wales. A ceremony will be held at 12:26 a.m. (local time) today,
to mark the moment when Dianas limousine hit the 13th pillar of an
underpass on a right bank expressway. Her companion, Dodi Fayed,
and the driver, Henri Paul, also died. The ceremony is being
organized by a private association, Paris Odysee, after the royal
family informed the British embassy and Paris city council that
expressions of grief should be limited to personal reflection.

   DIANA _ Monday is the first anniversary of Princess Diana's
birthday in eternity. That's a pious phrase long used by Christian
faithful to describe the day a saint died. For millions of her
fans, Diana, the Princess of Wales, remains a kind of secular
saint. She personifies, for them, all that is good and gracious in
a world of struggle and pain. To be sure, Diana struggled much,
knew great pain and was, in many ways, a good and gracious person.
But she is not likely to be a saint. The remarkable relationship
between the troubled princess and her adoring public is more
complicated. (Gushee, Palm Beach Post). 21.

   GLENN _ John Glenn's historic return to space is now just two
months away but knowlegeable observers remain unimpressed with the
science of the flight, even as they pledge support for it on
thematic grounds. But that's what NASA had in mind anyway. NASA
Administrator Dan Goldin spoke frankly in an interview with us
earlier this summer about how he insisted the science be
legitimate, but how he never intended for it to be the sole
justification for Glenn's return to space. ``I wasn't asking the
National Institutes of Health to say, 'I want you to fly John
Glenn.' But I said, 'Given that John Glenn is flying I want you to
tell me that he's doing good science.''' (Montgomery, Dayton Daily

   FLU-RISK _ Eighty years ago, the Spanish Flu virus killed 40
million people and then disappeared. Scientists trying to pry its
secrets out of an Arctic cemetery are taking no chances that they
might bring it back to life. The four-nation team believes that
frozen remnants of the virus are in the bodies of seven victims
that were buried in permafrost in the island outpost of
Longyearbyen, north of the Norwegian mainland. The chance that the
1918 virus hidden in the bodies remains infectious is ``very small
- but it is not zero,'' according to Peter Lewin, a pediatrician
who was asked to join the team becuase of his hobby: medical
archaeology, which included recovering smallpox virus fragments
from an Egyptian mummy. The team hopes for the best but is assuming
the worst: Pathologists will wear protective gear compatible with
arctic clothing, and the tent around the excavation will be the
portable equivalent of the most secure lab at CDC. (McKenna,

   JAMAICA-BROTHELS _ KINGSTON, JAMAICA _ A fervent call has come
in Jamaica to legalize brothels by none other than ... the
president of the Chamber of Commerce? ``We could be like
Amsterdam,'' said Howard Hamilton. Tourism provides jobs for more
than 40 percent of the island's population. But tourists aren't
flocking to Jamaica like they once did because of harassment, the
worst in the Caribbean. In the midst of an economic depression,
tourists find themselves bombarded by desperate panhandlers,
prostitutes, drug dealers and craft vendors, so much so that
Holland America and Celebrity Cruise Lines pulled out of Jamaica
last year. Jamaica has increased fines for those who badger

   BELARUS-PUPPET _ MINSK, Belarus _ The Soviet Union has collapsed
and the Moscow nights swing nowadays, but back here in Minsk old
communist-style think still remains the norm. Take the case of
``Pinocchio.'' The Belarussian version of the traditional puppet
show for children was yanked off the Minsk stage not long ago when
critics saw too many allusions to the current nasty political scene
in the play. How could a mere children's show cause so much offense
in this dictator-run land? That's easy. To begin with, Ales Surau,
the set designer, dressed the wooden ``actors'' in contemporary
quilted jackets, Russian workers' caps, and workers' rubber boots.
That act alone aroused the ire of the official critics. ``The
peasants look like criminals. I was at a collective farm not long
ago and I saw people there who were very well dressed,'' one them
complained. (Golinski, Cox News Service).

   MEXICO-DEAFMUTE _ MEXICO CITY _ He sold trinkets in the New York
subway, Chicago and the suburban American South. But by the time he
was discovered by U.S. authorities, life had changed for Braulio
David Infante. He knew that deaf people in the United States had
high schools, colleges and could develop professions. He was smart
and ambitious why couldn't he? Infante, who just turned 20, was
among the many undocumented Mexican deaf mutes discovered in the
United States last year, some held in virtual captivity and forced
to turn over trinket profits to ring leaders. Infante was sent back
from Atlanta to Mexico, where authorities promised to help him and
others with new opportunities to overcome barriers in Mexico.
Almost a year later, he says, nothing has changed. The Mexican
government recently made similar promises to deaf mutes who
returned from New York in July. But Infante says social workers
here have treated him as if he were mentally retarded. Clever and
resourceful, he longs to break out of the silence that isolates
him. He wants to attend college and become a Mexican-American Sign
Language interpreter. But in Mexico there isn't even a high school
for him to attend. Infante remains in contact with his Atlanta
lawyer, and dreams of one day attending school in the United
States. (Ferriss, Cox News Service).

THE KID HITS 80, BUT HE'S STILL THE KID
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Kid is 80 today.
</P>
<P>
   Later they contrived other nicknames. The Splendid Splinter. The
Thumper. Toward the end of his glorious career he was Teddy
Ballgame. But to me he's The Kid eternally.
</P>
<P>
   The tag was applied in the spring of 1938 by Doc Cramer, then a
veteran in the Red Sox outfield; and The Kid was all or most of the
news in the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   Back there in 1937 I had learned to read, and I pleaded with my
father to show me how to decipher a baseball box score. Baseball
scholarship is a family heirloom, through which I sought and
achieved a meaningful tie with my father.
</P>
<P>
   I was captivated by that 1937 season in which a vital part of my
tutelage was learning to hate the Yankees. I waxed impatient for
another major league campaign to come around; and I supposed one
had, when the ``Star-Telegram'' suddenly was filled with game
reports and box scores. I didn't know they were exhibition games.
</P>
<P>
   There again were magical names that had regaled me the year
before. Gehringer, Medwick, Ott, Vaughan, Foxx ... and yes,
DiMaggio. They're all in the Hall of Fame now, but in that early
spasm of '38 they were shoved off the headlines by an upstart. He
was 19, his name was Ted Williams, and he was my first definition
of the word rookie.
</P>
<P>
   Day after day he smacked home runs that won games. ``Kid Powers
Sox Again'' is a headline enshrined in permanent memory. So I was
crestfallen, dumbounded when my father said the Red Sox were
sending the Williams kid back to the minor leagues. Tearfully, I
asked why. My father said the boy had to learn to play the
outfield; and besides, they had to cut him down to size because he
was too cocky.
</P>
<P>
   Cockiness was an early entry in the legend of Ted Williams. The
great Red Sox second baseman Bobby Doerr, Ted's soulmate who played
with him in the Coast League when both were 18, contributed an
anecdote that lacquers the legend. At the Bosox training camp in
'38, Doerr said ``Ted, wait till you see Jimmie Foxx hit.'' The
Kid's reply was ``Wait till Foxx sees me hit.''
</P>
<P>
   They sent him to the American Association. The fabled high minor
league that expired last year after more than a century's
continuity was a valuable geography lesson for a 9-year-old. I
learned there were cities named Milwaukee, Louisville, Kansas City,
Columbus, St. Paul, Toledo ... and Minneapolis, one of whose
Millers would be The Kid.
</P>
<P>
   The 1938 season is rich in folklore. There was Gabby Harnett's
``homer in the gloaming'' that gave the Cubs the National League
pennant after the Pirates had led right to the end. And in the
American League, Hank Greenberg pursued Babe Ruth's record of 60
homers and had 58 with 11 games left to play ... but didn't hit
another one.
</P>
<P>
   All of that seemed secondary to what happened in the American
Association as I kept a Ted Williams Watch through ``The Sporting
News.'' All he did was gain the league's Triple Crown, hitting .366
over 148 games, with 43 home runs and 142 runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   With the 1939 spring renewal, The Kid was up to stay, and my
loathing of the Yankees was balanced by abiding love of the Red
Sox. Others from the American Association followed him into the big
time _ Jim Tabor, Stan Spence, Walt Judnich, Eddie Joost, Roy
Cullenbine, Eddie Miller; all are lost to history for today's fans
but were luminaries in their time and are memorable for me as
satellites of Ted's emergence.
</P>
<P>
   There was no official distinction as Rookie of the Year until
1948, but Theodore Samuel Williams spreadeagled the rookie field in
1939 to suggest Rookie of the Decade, perhaps Rookie of All Time.
He hit .327 with 31 home runs, and his 145 RBIs led the league. On
that August 30th he turned 21.
</P>
<P>
   His .344 average in 1940 took third place but Joe DiMaggio was
batting champ for the second year in a row; and at that point there
was hardly a suggestion that The Kid was in Joe's class. But he was
better copy _ still cocky, still irreverent _ and I became his
apologist and defender, one among many.
</P>
<P>
   In epochal 1941 the Williams-DiMaggio controversy flared in
earnest. Now I lived in Los Angeles and my closest friend was Billy
Bernhoft. We were both 12 _ the likely peak age for sport
hero-worship _ and baseball was the rhythm of our summer. Billy was
a Yankee fan and DiMag was his idol. From game 18, we monitored
Joe's hitting streak that incredibly reached 56 games. Unfair to
Joe in my allegiance to The Kid, I rooted against DiMaggio
throughout the streak. My solace was Ted's equally incredible .406
average.
</P>
<P>
   Also in '41, the greatest All-Star game ended when Ted connected
off the Cubs' Claude Passeau for a three-run homer into the upper
right-field stands at Detroit's Briggs Stadium. It gave the
Americans a come-from-behind 7-5 win and there is a classic photo
of The Kid skipping around the bases in uninhibited glee.
</P>
<P>
   I barely complained DiMaggio edged Ted in the MVP voting for
1941, but complained in earnest the next year. Yankee second
baseman Joe Gordon gained the distinction although Ted won the
Triple Crown. The powerful New York press campaigned knowingly
against The Kid, recycling his supposed deficiencies afield, always
trumpeting DiMaggio as the better ``all-around'' player.
</P>
<P>
   Ted never really surmounted the defensive knock, even after
becoming his league's best left fielder. Eventually it was conceded
that Williams was the superior hitter, possibly the best hitter
ever.'' But negative feelings about The Kid were not peculiar to
New York. He faced antagonism even in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Capital injustice occurred in the MVP balloting for 1947. Both
Williams and DiMaggio had lost three complete seasons ('43 through
'45) to military service. In the first postwar season, Ted easily
won the MVP award as the Red Sox won the AL pennant in a breeze and
DiMaggio had a flop year. But Joe D was back on his game in '47,
helping restore the Yankees to omnipotence.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams? It was his second Triple Crown, hitting .343 (to
Joe's .317) with 32 home runs (20 for Joe) and 114 RBI (97 for
Joe). That Ted would be the MVP was almost a foregone conclusion.
But wait. Dave Egan, a Boston baseball writer who hated Williams,
left him entirely off the ballot. For so personalized a statement,
Egan should have been disbarred from the Baseball Writers
Association. DiMaggio, placed somewhere on every ballot, edged Ted
by one point.
</P>
<P>
   Williams and DiMaggio posted super numbers in 1948 but both were
upstaged by Lou Boudreau. The '49 campaign yielded Ted's second MVP
year and was also the swan song for DiMaggio's greatness. Joe
burned out early and was gone after the '51 season, aged 37. Ted
was on the scene another decade, ever larger than life, although
his career again was punctuted by military service during the
Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   Not enough ever will be written about the Williams numbers that
might have been. Like Hank Greenberg and Bob Feller, but even more
than they, Ted was robbed statistically by losing almost five years
of his gaudy prime to military service. He should have had more
than 3,000 hits, and reasonably could have swatted 700 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Of Joe DiMaggio's 13 active seasons, eight or nine rate as
top-flight. Williams played 16 full seasons and parts of three
others and had only one subpar year, when he was 41. So I call
attention to another meeting I will cherish forever.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960 I interviewed Joe McCarthy in Palm Springs. He was Joe
DiMaggio's only manager in the prewar years, and later (1948-50)
was Ted Williams' field boss with the Red Sox. Many people sought
to have Marse Joe make a ``best'' judgment between Dimaggio and
Williams. He always parried the issue but gave me some
satisfaction. Bill Dickey was great but Mickey Cochrane was better;
Joe Gordon was spectacular but Bobby Doerr was more reliable. And
if he could have had his choice of any player to manage throughout
his career, Joe McCarthy would have picked Ted Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope that the sport world's newest octogenarian knows and
appreciates that.

L.A.'s MOST WANTED: SEARCHING FOR FUGITIVES NEVER ENDS 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As detectives closed in last week on Ronald
Figueroa, one of Los Angeles' most-wanted fugitives, he barricaded
himself inside an apartment in suburban Van Nuys with a .45-caliber
handgun.
</P>
<P>
   Just 23, the East Los Angeles gang member faced the possibility
of life in prison if convicted of murder charges. With police
negotiators using bullhorns to talk to him, Figueroa turned the gun
on himself.
</P>
<P>
   It was an unexpected end to the hunt for one of Los Angeles'
12,000 fugitives, including 3,334 in L.A.'s San Fernando Valley who
are on the run from police. Some of the Police Department's most
wanted have been on the list for 30 years or more, and among them
are 675 murder suspects.
</P>
<P>
   The pursuit never ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't give up,'' said Detective David Harrison, who leads
the search for fugitives in the Valley for the Fugitive Warrant
Section.
</P>
<P>
   When they finally are caught, ``a lot of them are surprised,''
Harrison said. ``They say, How did you find me? They did such a
good job of hiding that they can't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   In at least one way, Figueroa's suicide was an exception: Nearly
all of the 1,200 or so fugitives arrested last year were taken
alive. But like the encounter with Figueroa, none of the arrests is
easy, police say.
</P>
<P>
   Fugitives typically change their names and appearances, buy fake
driver's licenses and slip into the sprawl of the county's 9.3
million people. Some of them simply flee across the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to use all of your talent to catch them while they use
all of their talent to elude you,'' said Detective William Marsden,
a 16-year veteran of the LAPD's Fugitive Warrant Section.
</P>
<P>
   The ebb and flow in this hunt may now be turning in the police's
favor.
</P>
<P>
   The fugitive arrest rate is starting to rise largely because of
the addition earlier this year of 25 more detectives. That brings
the unit's strength to 68 detectives.
</P>
<P>
   And fugitive hunting has gone high-tech. As part of its new Web
site, the LAPD posted a list of the top 10 fugitives, along with
others wanted by the department's 18 divisions and various special
sections.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the top 10 fugitives have since been caught, leaving
seven still at large. All are considered armed and dangerous, and
police caution anyone who sees a suspect to call authorities
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Vargas is wanted for a May 27, 1995, slaying that police
say occurred when the 25-year-old gang member was hanging out with
10 to 20 other Latino men on a street corner in his native Pacoima,
19 miles northwest of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Four men walked up to Vargas' group and someone yelled out,
``Where are you from?'' said Detective Michael Arias of the LAPD's
Fugitive Warrant Section.
</P>
<P>
   ``Victor Vargas stepped out of the crowd, removed a handgun and
began shooting in the direction of the four,'' Arias said.
</P>
<P>
   Jose A. Gonzalez, a Pacoima gang member, was killed and another
person was wounded, Arias said.
</P>
<P>
   Police caution that Vargas is armed and desperate because
another arrest on top of his convictions for robbery and weapons
violations could make him eligible for a life prison sentence,
Arias said.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas may have fled to be with family in Mexico, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hector Guzman Lozano, 35, is wanted on allegations that he
stabbed a man to death during an attempted street robbery in Van
Nuys, 16 miles northwest of downtown, on July 29, 1997, police say.
</P>
<P>
   Lozano and his girlfriend were drinking in an alley about 2 a.m.
when they demanded money from a man drinking nearby, 25-year-old
Franco Cervantez of Van Nuys, police say.
</P>
<P>
   Cervantez did not have any money so he tried to run away but was
chased up a staircase by Lozano's girlfriend, who then knocked
Cervantez back down to the street, said Van Nuys homicide Detective
Steve Fisk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The girlfriend kept saying, Stab him, at which time Lozano
took out a knife and cut him'' with a ``Rambo style'' bowie knife,
Fisk said.
</P>
<P>
   Cervantez died of the wounds, and although Lozano's girlfriend
was arrested and charged, prosecutors dismissed the case because of
problems with her confession, Fisk said.
</P>
<P>
   Lozano was last seen in the Van Nuys area, Fisk said.
</P>
<P>
   Chicano Dews, 24, is a Los Angeles gang member currently on the
run from murder and attempted murder charges for a Dec. 12, 1997,
shooting that left one teen-age boy dead and another wounded,
police say.
</P>
<P>
   Dews and four other men were driving in the Venice area,
southwest of downtown, when they mistook the boys, who were riding
their bicycles in a residential area about 11 p.m., for rival gang
members, Arias said. Dews opened fire, killing a 14-year-old, and
wounding the other boy, neither of whom was a gang member, Arias
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To shoot two young boys on their bikes _ what a coward,''
Arias said.
</P>
<P>
   The other four people who had been with Dews have been arrested
and are awaiting trial on charges of murder, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dews was last spotted at an intersection near Inglewood, 13
miles southwest of downtown, Arias said.

LOS ANGELES: downtown, Arias said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Ethiopian citizen Alem Messaye, 26, has engaged in an
increasingly violent career of theft and robbery that culminated
about three years ago with the shooting of a carjacking victim,
detectives said.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Messaye ran an unlicensed tow-truck business that
would rip off customers for hundreds of dollars when they were in
desperate straits and turned to him for assistance, Arias said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then he realized he didn't need the tow truck anymore'' and
would simply yank people out of their cars in the process of
stealing the vehicle, Arias said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Messaye started using a gun in the robberies, leading to a
string of six carjackings in West Los Angeles and nearby Beverly
Hills, Arias said. Messaye shot his last known victim in the leg.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past years, Los Angeles police have gone to Toronto to
search for Messaye, who was believed to be hiding either in the
Ethiopian community there or in New York, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, detectives had Messaye within their reach when he
was arrested in Toronto, but they were unable to arrange for
extradition before he was released from custody and disappeared, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Enrique Monarrez, 31, is wanted for murder in the fatal
shooting of an accused drug dealer police say he killed after
chasing him a housing project in June 1996.
</P>
<P>
   According to police, Robert Orozco, 25, a suspected drug dealer
from Oceanside in San Diego County , went to the projects to
collect an unpaid debt of about $2,000 from gang members who lived
there.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the projects, Monarrez confronted Orozco, said Detective
Tom Herman of the Hollenbeck Division's homicide detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may have gotten smart-mouthed with them or they didn't like
him so they followed him out to his car, parked in the alley,''
Herman said.
</P>
<P>
   Monarrez and another gang member then chased Orozco through the
housing project and shot him near a church about two blocks away,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The other shooter has been arrested, but Monarrez fled and
police last heard he might be in El Paso, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Watts gang member Demecio Carlos Perez, 21, is accused of taking
part in a fatal drive-by shooting Feb. 14, 1995, that left one man
dead and another wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting occurred on a street in Watts as Jose Antonio
Juarez, 20, was standing with three other men, said Detective Ray
Morales.
</P>
<P>
   Perez and several other male Latinos drove up in a black Buick
Regal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They stopped in the roadway and the right front passenger
asked the group, Where you vatos from?'' before pulling a handgun
and firing into the group, Morales said.
</P>
<P>
   Juarez was killed, and another man was wounded in the right
shoulder, he said. That man later identified Perez as one of the
attackers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Michael Bernabeau, 24, is wanted for a string of armed
street robberies, including one Jan. 5 when he and two other men
are accused of robbing a catering truck driver in South Los
Angeles, police say.
</P>
<P>
   Two days before that, Bernabeau is suspected of robbing a person
at a pay phone in Torrance, 19 miles southwest of downtown Los
Angeles, said Detective Tony Ketelsleger.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a propensity for violence and preys on unsuspecting
victims _ people who are not paying attention, who are just walking
down the street or using the phone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bernabeau was last known to live in the suburban Paramount area
and was spotted there a few months ago. He also likes to hang out
in Long Beach, 24 miles southest of Los Angeles, Ketelsleger said.

   WOODBRIDGE, Va. _ The first major marina to be built in the
metropolitan Washington region in more than 15 years is to open
next spring across a tidal bay from a national wildlife refuge that
was designated to preserve the American bald eagle.
</P>
<P>
   The builder and developer is Preston Caruthers of Arlington,
Va., who says he has spent 10 years and $1.75 million designing and
building a harbor for his marina. It will serve as the focal point
for the 325-acre Belmont Bay community, which he is developing
about 20 miles southwest of downtown Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Caruthers said he plans a community of more than 2 million
square feet of commercial and office space and 1,710 residential
units with a mix of housing offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen permits were required from federal, state and local
agencies before dredging for the harbor could begin last winter.
The installation of floating piers this fall for the 158-slip
marina will add $1.25 million to the cost of the project, Caruthers
said.
</P>
<P>
   The harbor is nestled between sandy bluffs and a low hardwood
forest along the western shore of Belmont Bay, a tidal cove two
miles wide formed where the Occoquan River meets the Potomac River.
A 10-foot-deep channel allows boats to travel up the bay and then
proceed up the narrow river to the town of Occoquan.
</P>
<P>
   Because of strong opposition by citizens and the state and
federal agencies that own most of the land, remarkably little
development has taken place in the lowland forest, marshes and
bluffs along the Virginia shore of the Potomac River between
Washington and Belmont Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The National Park Service, the Army and the foundation that owns
the Mount Vernon Plantation are among those that have opposed
development.
</P>
<P>
   The eastern shore of Belmont Bay is formed by Mason Neck, a
boot-shaped peninsula that juts into the Potomac. The Federal Fish
and Wildlife Service and state and regional park agencies have
bought two-thirds of its 8,000 acres since residents successfully
opposed a developer's plan to build a planned community in the
'60s.
</P>
<P>
   Mason Neck National Wildlife Refuge was the first national
refuge established specifically for the preservation of eagles when
it was created in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the centerpiece of Mason Neck is a freshwater marsh
accessible only by foot or canoe. Eagles nest there in the late
winter and early spring. Adjacent to the refuge is Gunston Hall, a
Georgian mansion once the home of George Mason, the author of the
Virginia Bill of Rights, the model for the Constitution's Bill of
Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Caruthers has had an interest in large parts of the Belmont Bay
property since 1970. He said his property would have been developed
by now if weren't for the fact that a railroad line along its
western edge insulated it from the wave of suburban development
that swept south along Route 1 during the '50s and '60s. ``You
can't build any development of size where the only access is via an
on-grade railroad crossing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The access to the property that made large-scale development
possible occurred in 1992 when an $11 million Virginia Rail Express
commuter rail station opened up on 12 acres of land that Caruthers
had provided for the station and parking garages. To get to the
land, the state's Department of Highways built a four-lane highway
with a bridge to the station from Route 1, which resulted in vastly
improved access to the Belmont Bay development.
</P>
<P>
   An item in the federal surface transportation bill signed by
President Clinton this year authorizes $11 million for an
interchange that will extend Route 123 over Route 1 and directly
into the Belmont Bay property. Route 123 is a major artery that
extends north through Fairfax County to the far western corner of
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The interchange will enhance the appeal of the site because it
will eliminate the need to drive through a fading commercial strip
along Route 1 to enter the Belmont Bay development.
</P>
<P>
   The clear water, clean sand beaches and shelter from the wind
make two-mile wide Belmont Bay the favorite water-skiing spot in
the Washington area, said Thomas Pumpelly, a 14-year resident of
one of the few homes than can be seen from the Belmont Bay harbor.
Bass fishing is so good in the area that several national
tournaments have been held there in recent years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Pumpelly, who owns the Bay Bridge Marina east of Annapolis, Md.,
is negotiating with Caruthers to lease the harbor and operate the
marina. Caruthers is also holding discussions with several hotel
developers interested in building a resort/conference hotel on a
riverfront site adjacent to the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Because the marina is readily accessible and sales of family
power cruisers are booming, demand for slips will be high, said
Pumpelly.
</P>
<P>
   He said there should be no problem in renting out the Belmont
Bay slips, even though at an expected rental rate of $4,500 a year,
they will lease for 25 percent more than most slips in the area.
</P>
<P>
   A par-66 golf course available to the public opened in the
Belmont Bay development last year. It offers golfers long views of
the bay and the Potomac River as they thread their way along the
tops of bluffs and between marshes and wetlands. Modifications to
the course that will lengthen several holes and make it a par-70
course are now under way.
</P>
<P>
   Caruthers, who with a partner, George Snell, built thousands of
high-rise apartment units in Northern Virginia during the '60s,
said that even at premium rates he had no hope of recovering his
investment in the harbor and marina by renting slips to boat
owners.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he was hoping that the ambiance and activity
created by boats floating in the intimate harbor would set the
neotraditional village center and resort hotel apart and help them
flourish.
</P>
<P>
   Caruthers has promised to begin work on the village center this
fall once the Prince William County Board of County Supervisors
approves changes to its zoning ordinance that will permit
development of the village center with rectilinear street grids and
on-street parking along the harbor's edge.
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for four- and five-story buildings along a harbor
promenade with a small luxury hotel and restaurant at one end of
the waterfront and an office building at the other.
</P>
<P>
   Caruthers is negotiating with George Mason University to rent
space in the office building for its marine biology program and
hopes to convince the state science museum to build a fresh-water
aquarium next to the office building.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the harborfront, two five-story brick buildings
will have stores on the first floor and 60 condominium apartments
above that will probably sell for $260,000 to $300,000, Caruthers
said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, at the urging of County Executive Henry Bernhard
Ewert II, Caruthers agreed to share the cost of hiring Chad Floyd
of Centerbrook Architects and Planners in Essex, Conn., to develop
plans for the village center.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd has since prepared a design concept with federal period
architecture up to the roofline.
</P>
<P>
   To add visual interest, Floyd proposes varying rooftops with
penthouses, planters and balconies so that the two harborfront
five-story buildings will appear to be two sets of attached
buildings.

EDITORIAL NOTEBOOK: WONDERING WHERE THE WEST BEGINS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By VERLYN KLINKENBORG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the past few years I have driven west every summer, and
every summer the question returns: Where does the West begin? There
are plenty of common-sense answers, the kind that break this
country up into regions as neatly defined as the pieces in a
child's wooden puzzle. If it were just a matter of political
boundaries, I would not look for the West before the Colorado
border. And if it were just a matter of mood, the West would begin
in upstate New York on the day I walk the horses into the horse
trailer, check the running lights one more time and pull away into
the fog of dawn.
</P>
<P>
   The mind travels so much faster than a pickup truck carrying two
humans and two dogs, hauling two horses and their gear in a
gooseneck trailer. The first day we come to the farms and factories
southwest of Toledo, Ohio. There, rural roads dwindle to a single
paved lane, and cars, meeting each other, drive half on a gravel
track and half on the asphalt. A dank sulfurous glow hangs over the
truck stops and drive-ins near the Maumee River and the town of
Napoleon. The question of where the West begins is mooted, for the
moment. It is just another way of asking, When will we get there?
</P>
<P>
   But by early afternoon the next day _ western Illinois, eastern
Iowa _ I get momentary glimpses of a setting that carries me
westward a thousand miles at once. It is usually a pasture, rare
enough in an empire of soybeans and corn, threaded by a creek.
Cattle wander among the trees, one or two of the trunks rubbed
bare, bone-white. The scene flashes across my eyes, conjuring a
similar place along Wyoming's Tongue River or Crazy Woman Creek.
Then the corridor of corn resumes, row after row flickering past in
the wet August light.
</P>
<P>
   When the polite undulations of Iowa are past and we start the
slow westward uptilt of Nebraska, the search for the West begins in
earnest. Is it a copse of cottonwoods in a creek bottom? The first
herd of horses where the colors of roan and dun predominate? I am
always surprised, driving across Nebraska, that no one thinks to
mark the hundredth meridian, somewhere between Cozad and
Gothenburg, a well-known line of demarcation between the humid East
and the semi-arid West. But in Nebraska they irrigate the
cornfields, so the difference, in vegetation at least, is
diminished.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond North Platte, Neb., nearing Ogallala, the West begins
to preponderate, to win out over the Midwest. The mileage signs
give distances to Cheyenne and Denver instead of Chicago and Des
Moines. The low hills in the distance begin to be ridged with
pines, and the farms begin to look like ranches. Yet something is
still missing, some iconic marker. Sagebrush would do or a small
wilderness of yucca or prickly pear. And there, in the fields
ahead, is the answer. Now I remember, for the answer is the same
every year, on this highway at least. The West begins where the hay
is put up in stacks.

 &HT;    Bittersweet: DeBerg shines, Hanspard hurts
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're a Falcons fan, you might want to forget about scanning
the waiver wires this weekend looking for a quarterback. Steve
DeBerg changed the script Friday night _ with his right arm and
suddenly nimble feet _ when the 44-year-old quarterback stole the
show while leading Atlanta to a 17-0 win over Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   A pall was cast over the crowd of 26,269 at Georgia Dome,
however, when second-year running back Byron Hanspard was carried
from the field after he was tackled while scoring a 24-yard
touchdown on Atlanta's first possession of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   He will undergo an MRI today, but coach Dan Reeves said it is
believed Hanspard tore his the anterior cruciate ligament and
patella tendon in his left knee and will be out for the year.
</P>
<P>
   DeBerg fared much better.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta (2-2) led just 3-0 at halftime despite nearly doubling
the Bengals (1-3) in yardage (183-94), but then DeBerg led the
Falcons to touchdown drives on two of his first three possessions
</P>
<P>
   To see his line _ 10-of-14 passes completed for 129 yards and a
touchdown _ is not to understand, unless you're wide receiver
Terance Mathis.
</P>
<P>
   ''All you people who laughed at Steve DeBerg could see
tonight,'' Mathis said, ''that it doesn't matter how old you are if
you want to play and work hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, DeBerg was slow moving and throwing while
completing 6-of-11 passes for 39 yards in a 7-3 win at Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Some highlights:
</P>
<P>
   -- On his first possession, facing third-and-10 from Atlanta's
23, he threw 20 yards in the right flat, and rookie Jammi German
caught it, and ran another 22.
</P>
<P>
   -- Two plays later, DeBerg came under a heavy rush, and spun
slickly away, stepped left, and threw a hard pass to rookie Tim
Dwight for a 15-yard gain. Hanspard scored on the next play for a
10-0 Atlanta lead.
</P>
<P>
   -- Two possessions later, on third-and-8 DeBerg waited until the
last possible moment under a blitz, and dumped a screen to Harold
Green that got a first down. Soon, facing third-and-17 at the
Cincinnati 35, he threw deep middle where German caught a ball that
was exactly where it had to be between two defenders, a 29-yard
pass.
</P>
<P>
   On third-and-goal from the 3, he found German again for a TD.
That was good for a 17-0 lead with 2:21 left in the third quarter.

 &HT;    Crash into wall claims a driver
 &HT;    By Rick Minter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first night race at Atlanta Motor Speedway turned tragic
after only a single lap of the Georgia Power 200 had been completed
Friday. Rookie driver Chad Coleman, who had started 12th, was
racing for position on the backstretch when his Ford slammed into
the retaining wall.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue workers tended to Coleman at the track and he was flown
by LifeFlight helicopter to Georgia Baptist Medical Center where he
was pronounced dead, according to track officials.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital officials refused to release any information.
</P>
<P>
   Track officials said Coleman, 30, lived in Greenville, S.C., and
was single with no children. He operated a business called Sign
Crafters.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, who was driving in his fourth ARCA race, became the
sixth person to die in racing-related accidents at the speedway.
Four drivers and two crew members have perished.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman began his racing career at a short track in Anderson,
S.C., and ran a few races at Lanier National Speedway in Braselton
before moving to ARCA this year. He led briefly in his first
appearance, at Daytona International Speedway in February.
</P>
<P>
   Racing announcer Charles Head from Toccoa described Coleman as
``a real good kid'' who was courteous to officials and his fellow
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ARCA driver Mark Gibson from Winder, Ga., who finished third
behind winner Frank Kimmel, said the blame for the crash shouldn't
be placed on the ARCA series, which features mostly veterans, but
also other drivers with limited experience, on big fast tracks such
as AMS.
</P>
<P>
   ``All racing is dangerous, it doesn't matter what series,''
Gibson said. ``You take that chance when you climb through the
window.''
</P>
<P>
   Race winner Kimmel called Coleman's death ``very sad'' and
dedicated his win to Coleman's family.

CLINTONS END A MOST UNUSUAL VACATION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN O'BRIEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. _ Finally, it's over.
</P>
<P>
   Scandal persists, and threats from international terrorists
loom, but the Martha's Vineyard vacation that existed in a climate
of sex, lies, and a rise in sales of ``Wag the Dog'' videotapes,
ends Sunday when President Clinton and his family leave this
island.
</P>
<P>
   With the president avoiding the golf course and the whole family
skipping the Agricultural Fair, it seemed at times that the
vacation never really started.
</P>
<P>
   But in his last few days on the Vineyard, the president nearly
approached his style of summers past _ venturing out to Alley's
General Store and reaching out to his local supporters at the Oak
Bluffs Union Chapel with a speech about forgiveness _ something
Clinton made clear he needs from the country, and his family.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner companions who enjoyed a pig roast and clambake at the
oceanfront home of Mattel Inc. director William Rollnick and his
photographer wife, Nancy Ellison Rollnick, Friday night said they
spoke with a president who was noticeably more relaxed than when he
and Hillary Rodham Clinton attended a private dinner party at the
home of investment banker Steven and Maureen White Rattner six days
before.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the president engaged in a lively conversation with,
among others, Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz about
the Bible and reconciling differences in science and religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night, he was in a very upbeat mood,'' said Dershowitz,
who attended the Rollnick and Rattner dinners. ``You couldn't tell
a difference between the Clinton of last night and the Bill Clinton
of a year ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the snapshots from this summer vacation are few, and the
most memorable one is a serious image _ Clinton announcing US
military strikes in Afghanistan and Sudan. That prompted some to
draw a comparison to ``Wag the Dog,'' the movie where a military
action is faked to create diversion from a president's affair with
a young girl in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   This year, there was not a single golf outing, and no jokes
about how a guy who takes three shots off the first tee breaks 80.
With his presidency in crisis, Clinton's vacation was apparently
spent hunkered down, with White House aides saying he spent hours
on the telephone with friends and advisers.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, his press secretaries were doing much to
support the impression that Clinton was in the dog house at his
summer White House, after his televised confession of having had an
inappropriate relationship with former White House intern Monica S.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   If the lack of a golf outing was a surprise, the absence of the
first family at a Sunday church service was enough to get even the
most loyal tongues wagging.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found that really sad,'' said Espresso Love owner Carol
McManus, whose Edgartown coffee shop has sold Clinton presidential
muffins in years past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody wondered if they were afraid to go because
it would appear hypocritical _ or if he would have had to go alone.
He couldn't do that. The whole thing is very sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Presidential host Richard Friedman, who owns the Oyster Pond
estate where the Clintons vacation, acknowledged that Clinton was
busier than in vacations past, but insisted that his guests managed
to find time to rest _ and spend time together.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons did not attend any public events together this
year, as they have each summer past.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if there was a memorable media image from last year's
vacation, it was the exclusive photograph of the president and the
first lady cuddling on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from their island arrival, the Clintons were photographed
once together, on their only afternoon outing as a family, aboard
the yacht owned by newsman Walter Cronkite.
</P>
<P>
   It is not as if the Clintons have not dealt with turmoil _ or
tragedy _ during their vacations. Last summer, while dining with
the Rollnicks, they received the stunning news that Princess Diana
had been killed.
</P>
<P>
   But that was also the summer they attended at least seven
private parties, one so loud that the West Tisbury police were
called by neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the few private parties they attended included guests
such as former Washington Post chairman Katharine Graham, newswoman
Diane Sawyer and her husband Mike Nichols, humorist Art Buchwald,
and entertainment mogul Harvey Weinstein.
</P>
<P>
   But the memories of summers past _ the Clinton family wandering
into a local family reunion on South Beach and Clinton singing with
schoolchildren beneath an American flag at the Agricultural Hall _
seemed to fade with each news briefing and questions about a
family, and country, betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, islanders who have welcomed Clinton each year say they
feel strongly that he deserved the break, and hope he will return
with higher spirits _ and approval ratings.
</P>
<P>
   On this island, Clinton is now viewed as most summer visitors
are: mostly tolerated, sometimes appreciated, and always berated
for the traffic problems they bring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this sounds corny,'' said Ronald Rappaport, island
native, attorney, Vineyard representative to the Steamship
Authority, and presidential dinner guest, ``but I think it's an
honor to have the president of the United States choose to visit
the island I love.''

<P>
   WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. _ When it counted the most, the 12-year-olds
from Toms River, N.J., finally got a lead they could hold on to for
the rest of the game on Saturday. And with it, they got a victory
they can hold on to for years.
</P>
<P>
   After blowing three-run and four-run leads earlier Saturday
afternoon, Toms River set itself up for a dramatic finish in the
championship game of the 52nd annual Little League World Series.
Breaking an 8-8 tie, the team scored four runs in the top of the
sixth inning, then held on in the bottom of the inning for a 12-9
victory over Kashima, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Kashima had scored four runs in the bottom of the fifth inning
to tie the game, and the score was still deadlocked when the
reserve outfielder Chris Cardone came to bat for Toms River in the
sixth, with two outs and Casey Gaynor on first.
</P>
<P>
   Just three pitches later, the right-handed-hitting Cardone
smacked Takeshi Kato's offering over the wall in right-center field
for a two-run home run and a decisive 10-8 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Toms River tacked on two more runs, and when Todd Frazier, who
had come on in relief in the fifth inning, struck out Tatsuya
Sugata swinging for the final out, Toms River had completed its
improbable run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this guy right here,'' Manager Mike Gaynor said,
putting his arm around Cardone during the post-game news
conference. ``That last at-bat, he just caught a hanging curveball.
Timing is a beautiful thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory, before a crowd of 41,200 Howard J. Lamade Stadium,
was the fourth Little League championship for a New Jersey team and
the first since Lakewood's in 1975. It was the first victory by the
U.S. champion in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Cardone had also homered in his first at-bat, when he came on as
a pinch-hitter in the fourth. There were 11 homers in the game, six
by Kashima, including three by Tetsuya Furukawa and two by Sugata.
</P>
<P>
   Sugata was Kashima's starting pitcher, but lasted only eight
batters as Toms River jumped on him from the start. Frazier, who
started the game at shortstop, slammed Sugata's third pitch of the
game over the left-field wall, his fourth home run of the World
Series and his 15th in tournament play. After Scott Fisher and Joey
Franceschini walked, Gaynor lined a single into right-center that
scored Fisher. Franceschini would cap the first-inning outburst by
scoring on a passed ball. Toms River seemed to be on its way, and
it had not even taken the field yet.
</P>
<P>
   For some in Toms River, the team seemed on its way long ago.
Last December, Chris Kondek, whose husband, Ken, is an assistant
coach for Toms River, was planning a September trip to Las Vegas,
Nev., to celebrate a friend's 50th wedding anniversary. Ken Kondek
refused to go along with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I don't want to go because I'm going to
Williamsport,''' said Chris Kondek, who has been wearing a shirt
that says `coach's widow' all week long. ``And this was in
December.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was wishful thinking on the part of Ken Kondek,
considering that he was planning to retire from Little League
coaching this summer after 20 years and wanted to go out right. Or
maybe he really knew something about these players.
</P>
<P>
   But Kashima was not about to make the championship road any
easier. After Kashima's first two batters flailed badly at Gaynor's
pitches, second baseman Kenta Furukawa and Sugata hit back-to-back
home runs to draw Kashima within a run. In the third inning,
Kashima tied it and then pulled ahead, 4-3, on Furukawa's home run,
his second in as many at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   But the sudden change of fortune did not dampen the enthusiasm
of the legion of Toms River fans in the stands. At this point in
the Toms River season, nothing was out of the realm of possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the rally that put Toms River back in the lead
started with Frazier. His single to lead off the top of the fourth
set the stage for Fisher, whose complete-game victory on Thursday
night got Toms River to this point. Fisher slammed an 0-1 fastball
over the right-center-field fence to put Toms River up by 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to get up and start things and get everybody else
a chance to hit,'' Frazier said.
</P>
<P>
   After Franceschini reached on an error, Gaynor gave himself and
his team some breathing room with a towering home run to center.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of it all, Mike Gaynor was the personification of
cool. Having driven back late Friday night after slipping out to
see his older son, Colin, at a football camp, Gaynor was pretty at
ease for someone who had not slept much.
</P>
<P>
   After Saturday morning's practice outside Lamade Stadium, he was
chatting it up with parents, well-wishers and reporters as if it
was just another Saturday afternoon at the Little League field.
</P>
<P>
   But deep down, he had to know that this was much bigger. He had
to have known ever since the East region tournament in Bristol,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember one of the really nice things he said after we won
at Bristol,'' Chris Kondek said of Mike Gaynor. ``He said, `No
matter what happens, win, lose or draw, I just want to see the look
on the kids' faces when they get to Williamsport and see the field
for the first time.'''
</P>
<P>
   Not only has Gaynor provided his dozen 12-year-olds from Toms
River the thrill of being in Williamsport, but he has also guided
them to a Little League World Series title.

COOK'S 62 THRUSTS HIM UP AMONG THE LEADERS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AKRON, Ohio _ For John Cook, Saturday was a magnificent stroll
down memory lane, a special day in the state where he was born, the
state where he starred as a collegiate golfer at Ohio State, and
the tournament where his father, Jim, is still the director.
</P>
<P>
   After each of Cook's nine birdies, his gallery grew louder and
larger. Some fans remembered Cook from 20 years ago. Others were
simply jumping on the bandwagon, aware that something special was
happening at the third round of the World Series of Golf.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Cook reached the 16th hole, he was already nine
under par for the day, with a legitimate chance to shoot a 59,
something that has been done only twice on the PGA Tour. He would
not make it, but he finished with an eight-under 62, the best round
of the tournament and just one stroke shy of the course record. And
in joining Phil Mickelson, Mark O'Meara and Tiger Woods in the
chase behind David Duval, Cook helped set up what could be a
dramatic finish.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting a four-under-par 66 Saturday, Duval led at nine under
par for the tournament (201), one stroke ahead of Cook and two
strokes ahead of Mickelson, who shot a 66 Saturday. O'Meara was in
fourth place at six under after Saturday's 65, while Woods shot a
70 and fell from a first-place tie into fifth place, four strokes
back, after making a costly double-bogey at No.18. Craig Parry, who
started the day tied for first place with Woods and Duval, shot a
72 and fell into a sixth-place tie.
</P>
<P>
   Cook's 62 was the kind of round that players dream about, where
almost every shot feels good, when putts keep falling, when
momentum seems to build with each hole. Cook started the day at
even par in a tie for 10th place, five strokes off the lead, but
when the day ended, his round was the talk of the day. When Cook
thought about the leader board he joined, his heart pumped.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I'm here for, to get to the level that those guys
are on every week,'' said Cook, a 41-year-old tour veteran with 10
career victories, including this year's GTE Byron Nelson Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Cook was on a level all his own Saturday, taking advantage of
greens softened by overnight rains and playing one of the finest
rounds of his career. At the par-5 No. 2, he reached the green in
two shots, then two-putted from 60 feet for birdie. At No.4, Cook
made a 50-foot putt for birdie. At No. 5, he made a 15-foot birdie
putt. At No. 7, he hit a gorgeous 2-iron approach shot to within
two feet of the cup, then tapped in for birdie. At this point,
Cook's caddie, Jeff Weber, knew Cook was in a zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a day I didn't have to say much,'' Weber said. ``Just
give him the yardage, and get out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook saved par at No. 9 by making a 15-foot putt, then he
started another birdie streak on the back nine. At No. 10, Cook hit
an 8-iron approach to within five feet, then made the putt. At No.
11, he hit a pitching wedge approach to six feet, and made the
birdie putt. At No. 13, he hit perhaps his best shot of the day, a
2-iron out of the rough that ran past the cup and stopped 15 feet
away. From there, Cook hit another special shot, using a wedge to
sink the next shot for birdie.
</P>
<P>
   At No. 14, Cook hit a 9-iron approach shot to within one foot of
the cup, then tapped in. The next hole brought the next birdie,
when Cook made a 12-foot putt at No. 15.
</P>
<P>
   When Cook reached the par-5, 16th tee, he needed two birdies and
a par for a 59, the record low PGA round set by Al Geiberger at
Colonial Country Club in Memphis in 1977 and equaled by Chip Beck
at Sunrise Golf Club in Las Vegas in 1991. But after Cook set
himself up with two good shots at No.16, his approach with a wedge
flew over the green and into the rough. Cook got up and down for
par, but he made a three-putt bogey at No. 17, missing a par putt
from three feet, when it rimmed the cup and stayed out. Then Cook
missed a 12-foot birdie attempt at No.18 and settled for his 62,
pleased that he had left himself in position to win.
</P>
<P>
   But Duval will start as the leader. Duval was his normally
unflappable self Saturday, though he was playing with Woods for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowds were quite large, and I dare say the majority were
there to watch Tiger,'' Duval said. ``Because of that, I made up my
mind to be very focused on what I was doing, not pay attention to
the ruckus.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Woods ended his round disappointed after his
double-bogey at 18, when he hit his second shot into a bunker,
barely got out, then three-putted. ``The debacle at 18 is not how I
wanted to end,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Woods will have another chance Sunday, as will Cook, who led
last year's tournament after three rounds but shot a 74 in the
final round and finished tied for third, losing to Greg Norman.
``That was my biggest disappointment in golf,'' Cook said. ``I will
use that to motivate me.''

 &HT;    Mac blows his stack

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ On one of the strangest afternoons to ever visit
this baseball city, the Braves beat the Cardinals 4-3 amidst
intermittent trash showers Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire was thrown out for arguing a strike call in the
first, causing a near riot. Tom Glavine walked three men in a row
in fourth. Three! Ryan Klesko dropped a liner while performing a
face-plant in the fifth that started a 7-6 double play. Javy Lopez
hit his 29th homer, Glavine won No. 18, Rudy Seanez recorded his
second save and that hardly described what happened at Busch
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Non-stop,'' said Klesko. ``It didn't feel like a baseball
game. It felt like we were playing in an over-30 league. There was
something every inning.''
</P>
<P>
   But nothing like the first, when Glavine threw a full-count
inside fastball to McGwire that started in and dropped even
further. Plate umpire Sam Holbrook called strike three. McGwire was
joined by manager Tony La Russa in a demonstration that caused both
their ejections.
</P>
<P>
   Denied their chance to witness any more of Big Mac's home run
history this day, the crowd of 47,627 fans littered the field with
trash, hats, baseballs, full soft drink containers and other
jetsam. For a period, every foul was thrown back on the field.
Between innings, the Braves ran for the dugouts as if under fire.
Of the incident, McGwire insisted the call was wrong but said, ``He
had a right to throw me out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing against Mark McGwire,'' said Holbrook. ``I hope
he gets the record as much as everybody else. We all have a job to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez did his with a two-run homer in the fourth, his fourth in
five starts, for a 2-0 lead that Glavine immediately discarded.
After Ray Lankford singled, Glavine walked Brian Jordan, Ron Gant
and Fernando Tatis and the Cardinals took a 3-2 lead on Placido
Polanco's two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Jordan and Gant, I was nit-picking too much, trying not
to give up a home run and give up the lead,'' said Glavine.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Lockhart hit a game-tying RBI-single in the fifth, before
Andruw Jones doubled in the game-winner in the sixth. ``(Cards
starter Kent) Bottenfield was yelling at the umps all day,'' said
Chipper Jones. ``So you felt every close play was going to go our
way.''

 &HT;    Ligtenberg sitting out to rest arm
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   St. Louis _ In a season filled with career firsts, Kerry
Ligtenberg has run headlong into another new experience _ knowing
when to say when.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Cox has shelved his closer for at least the last
two games here and maybe Monday because Ligtenberg's right arm is
fatigued. Cox blames himself for over-relying on the rookie and he
has a good point.
</P>
<P>
   But a more experienced pitcher understands pacing. Ligtenberg
went on throwing until his fastball slowed down. Friday night it
cost him in a game-tying homer by Fernando Tatis. An inning later,
it also cost the Braves a loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point this year,'' he said, ``I think I was throwing a
lot and felt the same thing. My arm felt like it was dragging. And
I think I asked for a day off. Then we had a run of complete games
and I don't think I pitched for nine or 10 days. So after that, it
was like, 'Well, I want to be able to pitch every day.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ligtenberg gave up a homer to Ron Gant Thursday night, and when
he tried to reach back for something more when Gant came up Friday
night, it wasn't there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was muscling up a little bit,'' he said, ``and when I do
that, rather than being nice and loose with my arm, I get real
tight. That cuts velocity. But the worse thing is, when I get all
tight, I generally open up (in delivery) and .. the ball runs back
into the strike zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Gant only reached the foot of the wall in left. Tatis found the
seats in near straight-away center. The blown save was Ligtenberg's
first since May 23.
</P>
<P>
   Time stands still
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals were poised to break open a 3-3 tie in the fifth
Saturday when Eli Marrero opened the inning with a double, Ray
Lankford drew a one-out walk and John Mabry sent a sinking liner
into left field. Then the fun began. Ryan Klesko gloved the ball in
mid-dive and then lost it when he landed in a belly-flop. He
recovered the ball, turned to throw and time had stood still in the
infield. ``The way it happened and the way I fell, it looked like a
caught the ball,'' Klesko said. Klesko threw to Ozzie Guillen, who
tagged Marrero for the second out and stepped on second to force
out Lankford.
</P>
<P>
   Little Big Leaguer
</P>
<P>
   Braves broadcaster Don Sutton took Saturday off for a little
trip back in time, whisked back to Williamsport, Pa., where he was
honored as Little League Alumni of the Year. Sutton, who played his
Little League baseball in Molino, Fla., was jetted into central
Pennsylvania for the one-hour ceremony, held in conjunction with
the Little League World Series. In his place, son Daron Sutton
filled in on WSB radio.
</P>
<P>
   Take a hike
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have determined to pitch to Mark McGwire whenever
sensible this season, which made for an ironic statistic when Greg
Maddux, one of the game's great control artists, walked Big Mac
twice Friday night. Both walks were unintentional. Maddux has
walked just 26 batters unintentionally all year.

 &HT;    On Deck: St. Louis Cardinals
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When: 8:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Busch Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   TV/radio: ESPN, WSB 750-AM.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: RHP Kevin Millwood (14-8, 4.29; 1-0,
4.38 lifetime vs. Cardinals) vs. LHP Donovan Osborne (3-3, 2.81;
1-2, 4.95 lifetime vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Millwood is making his 25th start and is trying to end a
two-game losing streak that he does not really deserve. He has
allowed only five earned runs in his last two starts against San
Diego and Houston but the team has scored just two runs behind him.
Millwood is 4-4 in the second half but retains one of the league's
best strikeouts-per-nine-innings ratio at 8.3, the highest among
the rotation. He has struck out 39 batters in his last 32 innings.
He is 1-0 against the Cardinals in two starts this year, beating
Bobby Witt 4-3 at Turner Field on Aug. 2. Donovan Osborne, on and
off the DL twice this year, is making his fifth start since
rejoining the rotation Aug. 8. He is 2-1 in four starts this month
and though he gave up four runs in a 4-3 loss to Florida his last
time out, his recent work has been strong. His August ERA is 3.00.
In nine games this year, he has given up six home runs. Andres
Galarraga is glad to see him. He has a .467 career average
(7-for-15) with one homer against Osborne, while Greg Colbrunn has
hit .643 (9-for-14) with two homers against the left-hander.

 &HT;    Let `ST. DIANA' Image Rest In Peace
 &HT;    ATTN: EDITORIAL PAGE, OP-ED, RELIGION EDITORS
 &HT;    For Release Sunday, Aug. 30, 1998)
 &HT;    By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Monday is the first anniversary of Princess Diana's birthday in
eternity.
</P>
<P>
   That is a pious phrase long used by Christian faithful to
describe the day a saint died. For millions of her fans, Diana, the
Princess of Wales, remains a kind of secular saint. She
personifies, for them, all that is good and gracious in a world of
struggle and pain.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Diana struggled much, knew great pain and was, in
many ways, a good and gracious person. But she is not likely to be
a saint. The remarkable relationship between the troubled princess
and her adoring public is more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   She was 36 when she died in a car crash in a Parisian tunnel.
But not even her death could end more than 15 tumultuous years as
an object of international curiosity, adoration and mockery. Her
short, troubled life came to be seen as a kind of vicarious
atonement for all who suffer _ and survive _ ridicule, self-doubt
and defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Her followers believe Diana overcame nearly insurmountable
challenges to finally blossom as an independent, mature woman. And
they hope, through Diana's experience, that they may do the same.
</P>
<P>
   That makes Diana more a saviour than a saint. Saints live out
the will of God. Diana lived out both the nightmares and dreams of
her followers.
</P>
<P>
   Saints reflect God. Diana reflected the Angst of a generation.
She is a kind of icon for a self-absorbed, confused age that
identifies with her private struggle and envies her public
privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Those who still, in their own way, worship Diana believe they
know the rejection and insecurity she suffered because they suffer
the same. And they believe she won the struggle they daily engage.
So, they may have hope.
</P>
<P>
   They also claim Diana accomplished this generation's fundamental
spiritual goal: to find herself, discover meaning in life and peace
in her heart. And she did so in a fairy-tale setting of royalty,
expensive clothes, elaborate trips and international notoriety.
</P>
<P>
   For that she became ``the people's princess.'' In death,
however, her life became more fantasy than fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her death brought her into mythic proportions, not because of
who she was in their life but of what people wanted her to be,''
says the Rev. J. Brabban, associate professor of religion and
philosophy at Palm Beach Atlantic College in West Palm Beach. ``We
make her who we want her to be, living the life we want to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Diana was beautiful, wealthy and caught up in a glamorous fairy
tale gone terribly wrong. More than 1 billion people watched her
televised marriage to Charles, the future king of England, in 1981.
That many or more wept at her funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Millions followed her journey, step by torturous step. They
alternately rejoiced and wept as the naive schoolteacher became a
glamorous princess and devoted mother, a divorced member of the jet
set working to ban land mines and, finally, the victim of a tragic,
brutal crash.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, Diana lived the highly visible, privileged life of a
princess. Privately, she knew the hell of loneliness, self-loathing
and depression. The royal family disapproved of her. Her husband
cheated on her.
</P>
<P>
   She tried to kill herself, developed severe eating disorders and
took up lovers. Nothing worked. The marriage failed, but Diana is
remembered as one who not only survived but prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   Her life ended just as many believe she was beginning a new and
grace-filled chapter. Her presumed sainthood is rooted in that
experience _ and in her death. Sudden death _ especially the tragic
death of a young person _ often blurs the moral ambiguity in which
most of us live and confers instant beatification upon the
deceased.
</P>
<P>
   Something like that happened to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr., John and Bobby Kennedy. All were able men. None was a saint or
American icon until the abrupt and unexpected murder of each man.
``We highlight all the good qualities and make them larger than
life, the Rev. Brabban says, ``and we dismiss any negative
features. That creates not a saint but a fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   On the first anniversary of Diana's death, it is time to put the
fantasy of Diana to rest. Forget the nonsense about sainthood and
simply honor the genuine person she was, warts and all, a woman of
grace, laughter and tears.
</P>
<P>
   Even Diana deserves as much.
</P>

   WINSTON CUP
</P>
<P>
   Texas changes impress Jarrett
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jarrett made a quick detour to Texas Motor Speedway
recently and came back with good news for his fellow Winston Cup
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a very positive change for the stock cars,''
he said. ``You can see with the eye what's been done.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Texas 500 in April, much of the track surface was
removed because water seepage marred the event. A new drainage
system and a variety of waterproof materials were added, and the
transitions from the turns to straightaways were lengthened.
</P>
<P>
   ``The changes make this a better track,'' Jarrett said. ``The
transition into (turn) one and especially off four _ it's so fast
you'll definitely see the side-by-side racing the fans are
expecting. I'm really impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup driver Joe Nemechek and team SABCO owner Felix
Sabates have agreed on a new three-year deal through 2001. ... Five
drivers went from Bristol to Darlington for a one-day test session;
Mark Martin was fastest, 167.765 mph, followed by Bobby Labonte,
166.416 mph; Jeff Burton, 165.020 mph; Mike Skinner, 164.798; and
Johnny Benson, 162.834 mph. ... Rusty Wallace won the 1993 race at
New Hampshire from the worst starting position in the field, 33rd.
</P>
<P>
   BUSCH
</P>
<P>
   Lepage's second
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Lepage recorded the second victory of his Busch career,
while Phil Parsons' runner-up finish equaled his best of the season
at Bristol. Parsons also was runner-up earlier this year at
Talladega. ... Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s 15th-place finish was his worst
since placing 30th at Charlotte in May, a span of 11 races.
Earnhardt still extended his points lead over Matt Kenseth, whose
34th-place finish was his first non-top 20 in the past 10 races.
... Steve Grissom made his 1998 debut by winning the pole, but he
crashed midway and finished 27th. ... Stat of the week: Randy
LaJoie's victory in last year's Darlington Dura-Lube 200 has been
the only one by a Busch Series regular. ... Mike McLaughlin and
Buckshot Jones are 1-2 in Top 10 Miles Leaders. McLaughlin has
4,827.37 and Jones, 4,826.69.
</P>
<P>
   CRAFTSMAN TRUCKS
</P>
<P>
   Jack be quick
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the Craftsman Truck Series championship will be
determined in Las Vegas between Ron Hornaday and Jack Sprague. With
nine races remaining, Hornaday took a 52-point lead into Saturday's
Kroger 225 at Louisville Motor Speedway. And like most who ride in
second place, Sprague says it's much too early to talk about
championships. And with some reason. He finished fourth a week ago
in Topeka and cut 18 points off Hornaday's lead.
</P>
<P>
   Bad day in Topeka
</P>
<P>
   Joe Rutman was a victim of circumstances at Topeka. When the
green flag dropped, Mike Wallace missed a shift and slowed as
Rutman surged ahead. But in order to avoid contact, Rutman swerved
left and passed Wallace. NASCAR assessed him a penalty, sending him
to the rear of the line. NASCAR policy states no passing on the
left at the start, leaving Rutman out to dry and in 22nd place by
lap 22.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Stacy Compton, winner at Topeka, is the fourth driver to score
more than a single victory in 1998. His other victory came April 25
at Portland. ... Rookie-of-the-year candidates Greg Biffle finished
13th and Andy Houston finished 15th.

 &HT;    Mayfield goes downhill
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ That fame is a fleeting thing was driven home
emphatically to Jeremy Mayfield as he sped into the first turn last
month at New Hampshire Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   He went into the turn running eighth, eight laps from the finish
and 40 points behind Winston Cup points leader Jeff Gordon. He came
out of the turn with a blown tire and hooked to a tow truck.
</P>
<P>
   He finished 30th and trailed Gordon by 137 points.
</P>
<P>
   And it's been mostly all downhill since. He comes to today's New
Hampshire 300 sixth on the points list, but 518 behind Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs, however, of recovery. He finished seventh and
eighth in the last two races, at Michigan and Bristol, and
qualified sixth-fastest for today's 300.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't much anybody could have done the last time
here,'' Mayfield said. ``Luck is such a big factor in this sport.
It's a long season and you figure things will even out. But, this
is a tough track.''
</P>
<P>
   Not for everyone. Defending champion Jeff Burton has won twice
in his last three trips here. He dominated the June Jiffy Lube 300,
leading four times for 188 of the 300 laps.
</P>
<P>
   His margin of victory was 7.439 seconds ahead of Mark Martin. He
won the July, 1997 race by 5.372 seconds in front of Dale
Earnhardt.
</P>
<P>
   What gives?
</P>
<P>
   ``You like wherever you run well and we always seem to run well
here, whether it was in a Busch car or a Cup car,'' Burton said.
``I'm just comfortable on this track. I like the environment. I
like the people. I like everything about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough track. The rubber builds up on the track and
you've got to figure out a way of running around that. There are
just a lot of challenges that go along with New Hampshire, so that
makes it exceptionally tough.''
</P>
<P>
   As good as Burton will be, Gordon is favored. He's recovered
from the cold of a week ago at Bristol, where he was fifth, the
first time out of the top four since Richmond, 10 races ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always nice to start up front,'' said Gordon, who has
eight poles. ``There's two places you can go, either stay in front
or go backwards. Jeff Burton just killed us all here last time. We
think we've got a little better combination this time. We learned
something from the last time we were here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The track is going to be real narrow and slick for awhile. A
lot of guys are going to be coming up through the field because
qualifying was so tricky.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Martin, he's as confident as he was at Bristol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the track is a bit better than it was the first race
out here,'' he said. ``The groove is extremely narrow, but it's
going to widen. That won't be a problem anymore than usual here. My
take on the track is, comparatively, for New Hampshire is an A. I'm
very pleased with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the race, I have a great race car, the best I've had
here in a while. Last time up here, we had a great car and we
learned some thing from Jeff (Burton) and had a great run. Our
starting position is better (fifth), and our car is working better,
so we're anxious to get into this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Driver seriously hurt
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR Busch North Series driver Tom Bolles was seriously
injured Saturday during a race at New Hampshire International
Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-year-old driver from Ellington, Conn., was injured when
his car spun after slight contact with a car driven by Dale Shaw,
and crashed into the first turn wall.
</P>
<P>
   Bolles, in his ninth year on the Busch tour, was taken to the
infield care center before being transported to Concord Hospital
where a nursing supervisor said Bolles was in stable condition with
a neck injury in the hospital's intensive care unit.

 &HT;    Women's day for equal pay isn't far away
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In one grand year for women, Billie Jean King played Bobby Riggs
for social change and fought the U.S. Open for equal pay. She won
and she won. King also founded the Women's Tennis Association and
laid the groundwork for what is now the richest women's sports
circuit in the world, the Corel WTA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   That was 1973. Twenty-five years later, women's pro tennis has
come a long way, but not far enough, according to tour CEO Bart
McGuire. The U.S. Open is still the lone major that offers equal
pay to men and women, and that is grounds for a new battle of the
sexes, McGuire says.
</P>
<P>
   In January, just days into his new job, McGuire was in Melbourne
picketing the Australian Open. ``I'm tempted to say equal prize
money isn't enough at this point ... if you look around today at
the interest in the women's game, at the depth of the competition,
at the quality of the players, the television ratings,'' McGuire
said.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after, the ATP Tour came to McGuire with the idea of
staging as many as seven combined men's and women's tournaments
beginning in 2000, a marketing stroke to showcase the men's
Mercedes Super 9 series as big-time championships in the public's
eye. McGuire refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``The women's tour has something very special to offer in terms
of personalities who are charismatic and provide great theater, and
we're not going to offer it to someone who'll offer women half the
money the men get,'' said McGuire, who conceded that he would
settle for something less than a 50-50 split. ``We ought to start
at something like 80 percent (of the men's pay) and work our way
up.''
</P>
<P>
   McGuire's campaign has picked up speed this year, with Venus
Williams wrestling Martina Hingis for teen supremacy; the tragedies
and triumphs of Monica Seles; and the starts and stops of Steffi
Graf. The women's finals at the Australian Open and Wimbledon
captured higher ratings than the men's finals. The tour negotiated
a $125 million deal for its international TV rights, which will
more than triple that annual revenue. Attendance at the five North
American women's hardcourt events leading up to the U.S. Open was
up 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian Open, Roland Garros and Wimbledon already are
near gender parity in their pay scale, with their women's singles
champions getting from 88 percent to 95 percent of the men's
champs. But in those tournaments ranking just below the grand slams
_ the Super 9s and the women's Tier 1 events _ the differential is
substantial, with women averaging less than half the prize money.
Marcelo Rios and Hingis each won finals at Indian Wells, Calif.,
this year before sold-out crowds. Rios got $361,000, Hingis
$205,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``If women can draw the same as men on three levels _
spectators, TV audience and sponsors _ they deserve to be paid the
same,'' said Mike Davies, president of the Pilot Pen International
Championships, the men's and women's tournaments in New Haven,
Conn., that precede the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Davies also is vice president for sponsor sales for the Lipton
Championships, a combined event in Key Biscayne, Fla., that often
is called the fifth major. Davies credited men with luring 70
percent of the attendance 10 years ago. Now, he says it's ``45-55,
if not 50-50.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the men's tour set an attendance record at the du
Maurier Open in Toronto with a 119,688 total. Two weeks later, the
women came to the du Maurier of Montreal and set a Canadian
attendance record for tennis with 144,063. It was also the best
draw for a women's-only event in WTA Tour history.
</P>
<P>
   As for tournament sponsors, the Pilot Pen Co. would go with its
women's tournament over the men's if forced to choose between the
two, according to CEO Ron Shaw. ``They're the better deal because
the women are hot right now,'' Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
   But for every victory the women might claim, the men have one to
sober them up. Take Atlanta, for example, where last year's U.S.
Women's Hardcourt Championships, which left town for non-support,
drew fewer fans for its Lindsay Davenport-Sandrine Testud final
than first-day qualifying at the men's AT&AMP;T Challenge this year.
</P>
<P>
   And the women still don't approach the men in sponsorship
dollars in tournaments or personal endorsements, in part because
the young stars are still so new. According to research from the
Sports Business Journal, the women's players who earn the most from
endorsements are Seles ($6 million annually), Graf ($5 million),
Hingis ($3 million), Williams and Anna Kournikova ($2 million).
</P>
<P>
   Forbes magazine, which annually ranks athletes by their income,
included only Hingis among its top 40 and put Andre Agassi's
endorsement earnings at $10 million for 1997. Michael Chang ($9.5
million) and Pete Sampras ($8 million) also outpaced any woman.
</P>
<P>
   Another challenge for the women is TV. While the new deal with
Eurosport will help and comparative men-vs.-women ratings for the
Grand Slam finals sound good, men's TV revenue remains an estimated
three times as lucrative as the women's. McGuire is negotiating
with ESPN and Fox now and predicts significantly expanded coverage
in the United States next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I think we'll get there tomorrow? Probably not,'' McGuire
said. ``But we'll get there, because the evidence is so dramatic
that we deserve it.''

 &HT;    Teens spice of women's tennis
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not just about tennis anymore. Not in the women's game.
</P>
<P>
   It's about teenage self-expression and unabashed self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't consider myself cocky or arrogant,'' said Venus
Williams. ``I tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   It's about defending what is yours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Venus Williams thinks she's going to be No. 1? Oh, really?''
said Martina Hingis. ``Well, I suppose I've been the first of us
youngsters to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   It's about solving Richard Williams' riddles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there will be a rivalry between Venus and
Hingis,'' said the father of Venus and Serena. ``Venus' biggest
competition will come from Serena. Hingis' legs are too short to go
the distance with both of those girls.''
</P>
<P>
   It's about sex and innuendo.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I wouldn't be playing tennis, I wouldn't be noticed at
all,'' said Anna Kournikova, who calls her special fan, Detroit Red
Wings forward Sergei Fedorov, ``just a friend.''
</P>
<P>
   It's about talking smack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait to pick up the paper and see what Hingis has to
say about Venus, or Venus has to say about where she'll be in the
rankings,'' said Tracy Austin, the former teenager No. 1. ``I love
it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not about old school.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can Venus Williams say that she and Serena are going to be
No. 1 and win everything?'' asked Hana Mandlikova, who won the
Australian and French opens at 19. ``Excuse me, but that's bull.
They're going to be great, but at 17 I would never have said
something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   It's about respect and legends.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have a certain arrogance, and I think that's fine,''
Steffi Graf said, ``but what you should never lose is the respect
for the others. That's what I grew up with. I've always looked up
to Martina (Navratilova) and Chris (Evert).''
</P>
<P>
   It's about disrespect, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think she doesn't have any respect,'' Arantxa Sanchez
Vicario said about Serena Williams, whom she accused of saying
something ugly to her at the French Open. ``She cannot go on with
this attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   It's about a new attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are not used to young women expressing themselves so
confidently at such a young age,'' said Serena Williams, ``because
maybe they didn't believe in themselves when they were this
young.''
</P>
<P>
   Women's tennis is about four teenagers. Venus Williams, 18,
Hingis, 17, Kournikova, 17, and Serena Williams, 16, aren't the
sport's four best players, but they certainly have enlivened, if
not rescued, the WTA Tour from the predictability of Graf
domination and the monotony of uninspiring contenders.
</P>
<P>
   The teens are the impetus behind the new popularity of women's
tennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without doubt, we're going to be showcasing women at the U.S.
Open,'' said Rob Correa, the vice president of programming for CBS
Sports. ``There's great stories, a lot of up-and-coming stars that
have a certain brashness and cockiness about them. There's
Kournikova, who's the pinup girl, and Williams, who's 6-2 with a
monster serve, Hingis, who's won and she's only 17. And lurking you
have (Monica) Seles, who's considered an old-timer, and then Graf
going for perhaps her last hurrah.''
</P>
<P>
   And the teens transcend the sports pages.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Hingis became the first female ever to make the cover
of GQ magazine. She also has been featured in the Wall Street
Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Kournikova has been profiled in Rolling Stone, People and Elle
this year. Venus Williams was written up in Cosmopolitan and George
magazines, and the Williams sisters were the subjects of takeout
pieces in Vogue, Seventeen, Ebony and Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
   That's all just this year. Asked this summer for a list of men's
players featured outside of sports publications, the ATP Tour
couldn't find any.
</P>
<P>
   Venus Williams and Kournikova have appeared on ``The Tonight
Show with Jay Leno,'' Hingis on ``The David Letterman Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are reaching an audience that's not just the tennis fan,
not even just the dyed-in-the-wool sports fan,'' said Bart McGuire,
the CEO of the WTA Tour. ``It's the story of Monica coming back
after the stabbing and the death of her father, of (Jana) Novotna
winning her first Grand Slam at Wimbledon. They want to know if
Steffi can come back and can Venus and Kournikova win a Grand
Slam.''
</P>
<P>
   The sisters' splash into pro tennis and Hingis' emergence as the
newest superstar, not to mention Kournikova, came at a critical
time for the sport. Gabriela Sabatini retired at the end of 1996.
In January of 1997, Seles discovered that her father Karolj's
stomach cancer had returned and was terminal, and she became a
part-time performer thereafter. Then in February, Graf injured a
knee and ultimately needed surgery that would finish her for the
year.
</P>
<P>
   The truth was the tour hardly missed them last year. The young
stars haven't dominated the tour, but they've inspired rivalries
and given flavor to the Grand Slam titles won by old standards
Novotna and Sanchez Vicario this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm invigorated by it,'' said Amanda Coetzer, who shot her
ranking up to No. 3 last year. ``I think a lot of girls are, too,
and it's seen in the past results. ... It's been very healthy for
the game to have these young girls come up very confident.''
</P>
<P>
   A few veterans, Irina Spirlea and Iva Majoli among them, thought
some of the newcomers were arrogant, or at the least unfriendly.
Others simply marvel at their potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players today are better than when I was young,'' Mary Joe
Fernandez said. ``They do more with the ball, they're all-court
players, they serve and volley, hit drop shots, they lob. They're
just more well-rounded. They're better athletes, as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Billie Jean King reminds us that her old gang was considered
``pretty outrageous and on the cutting edge'' in the '60s and '70s
as warriors for equal opportunity for women, but not the way these
female players are.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my generation, growing up, we really tried to please a lot
more than these young women,'' she said. ``I think if they'd been
boys, young men, it's easier for people to accept that kind of
talk. It's good for people to hear women believe in themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly were extremely different,'' said Austin,
comparing herself and Andrea Jaeger, the teen stars of the late
'70s, with those of the late '90s. ``This group is about as
outspoken as you can be. We thought some of those things, `I think
I will be No. 1,' but it was not spoken.''
</P>
<P>
   And the dream teens are cashing in.
</P>
<P>
   The Sports Business Daily published a survey this summer that
ranked the most marketable women's athletes of the future, and
Venus Williams, Kournikova, Hingis and Serena Williams, in that
order, were the tennis players who made the top 20.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Williams trailed soccer player Mia Hamm and figure skater
Michelle Kwan, and some of those surveyed expressed concern about
Williams' volatility and considered her father a marketing
liability. ``The crybaby shenanigans she (Venus) demonstrates on
the court could hurt her,'' said Brian Donlon, vice president of
Lifetime Sports. ``She is more like John McEnroe and should be more
like Arthur Ashe.''
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, Williams has exploded publicly only once, virtually
coming to tears at Wimbledon while raging at an umpire.
</P>
<P>
   As for Serena Williams and Kournikova, they have not won a WTA
Tour tournament title and can't thrive forever on talent and hype.
Of Kournikova, Dean Bonham of the Bonham Group said she ``could
become an also-ran or the most marketable female tennis player
since Chris Evert.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, she's earning as much as $2 million annually, according
to the Sports Business Journal, from endorsements from Adidas,
Rolex and Yonex. That trails Seles and Graf, modern legends of the
game, but is significantly more than Lindsay Davenport and Novotna,
the current No. 2 and 3 players in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the rankings, the teens are the players people
want to read about and watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a bunch of women who can bounce the ratings,'' said
Mary Carillo, the lead analyst for CBS. ``There are rivalries, age
rivalries, seniors against juniors, many more rivalries. The cheap
rivalry in tennis now is between the men and women.''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with men's tennis today is that it's too good, some
people argue. The serves are too fast, the points too short. Men's
tennis is so deep with good players that the common fan can't keep
up with them all.
</P>
<P>
   This year's French Open illustrated that point. The men's final
brought together Carlos Moya, the handsome shot-maker and Spain's
greatest player, against Alex Corretja, another Spaniard, a
dirt-baller known for his indomitable spirit. In other words,
boring, at least to most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's Sunday ratings started at 2.0 and began dropping until the
Moya rout was complete, then rebounded slightly when NBC went to
taped coverage of the mixed doubles final with the Williams
sisters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there a call for more women? Yes,'' said Cliff Drysdale,
tennis commentator for ESPN. ``It's personality-driven. It's
Hingis, Kournikova and the Williams sisters, that's pretty clear.''

 &HT;    The dream teens
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Martina Hingis
</P>
<P>
   The facts: Born Sept. 30, 1980, in Kosice, Slovakia; lives in
Zurich with her mother, Melanie Molitor; 5-feet-7, 130 pounds;
right-handed with a two-handed backhand; coached by Molitor; ranked
No. 1 in the world since March 31, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The legend: Molitor, a junior champion in Czechoslovakia, named
her only child after Martina Navratilova. Determined to groom a
champion, Molitor started Hingis in tennis at 2 and gave her an old
wooden racquet she'd sawed off. Hingis' parents split when she was
3, and Hingis remains estranged from her father. Molitor remarried
and moved to Switzerland when Hingis was 7.
</P>
<P>
   The game: Hingis dominated the women's circuit last year,
winning three of the four majors, and became the youngest No. 1
player and Wimbledon champion in history. Hingis lacks the power of
the Williams sisters and Kournikova but is regarded as the game's
best tactician. She's ranked No. 1 in doubles and volleys superbly,
but her serve is mediocre.
</P>
<P>
   The personality: Except for the occasional claims that she's
cocky, Hingis plays the role of the pleasant teenager, bubbly,
carefree and well-liked by the players. She has her teenage
passions (horses), pastimes (in-line skating) and boyfriends
(Julian Alonso). With the media, she's blunt, believing the truth
is not bragging, but she's become gracious in defeat, even when the
opposition is Venus Williams, whose brash predictions have grated
on her.
</P>
<P>
   The money: At age 16, 1 month, 10 days, Hingis became the
youngest tennis player, male or female, to eclipse $1 million in
career earnings; she's up to $6.78 million for her career with
endorsement deals with Sergio Tacchini and Yonex that net her
between $3 million and $5.5 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The outlook: Winless since May, Hingis is vulnerable at the U.S.
Open and some are questioning her focus. As for marketing appeal,
she's set for life if she can continue winning just an occasional
Grand Slam title.
</P>
<P>
   Anna Kournikova
</P>
<P>
   The facts: Born June 7, 1981, in Moscow; 5-feet-8, 123 pounds;
plays right-handed with a two-handed backhand; lives in a Miami
Beach apartment with her mother, Alla; coached by Pavel Slozil,
Steffi Graf's former mentor; current ranking No. 14, career-high
ranking No. 10 (June 22, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   The legend: Kournikova's parents, Sergei and Alla, lived in a
two-room flat in Moscow when they pawned the family TV so they
could buy their young tennis prodigy a suitable tennis racquet. By
age 9, Kournikova got a free ride at the Nick Bollettieri Academy
in Bradenton, Fla., and became the youngest athlete ever signed by
IMG. They've trumpeted her coming greatness _ and sex appeal _ ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   The game: Restricted by the tour's age-eligibility rules last
year, she played just 10 events and got no higher than No. 25 in
the world. She did make the semifinals of Wimbledon and became an
instant British tabloid cover girl. This year, she's beaten five
current top-10 players, including Martina Hingis, but a thumb
injury kept her from defending her Wimbledon points. Still, she's
the consummate '90s player, with an athletic all-court game and
attitude, a top-10 performer regardless of her ranking.
</P>
<P>
   The personality: She's best known for waist-length blonde hair,
a tawny physique and her Sergei Fedorov boyfriend. What's
underneath doesn't impress some of her peers, who have accused her
of being self-absorbed and unfriendly. With the media, Kournikova
loves cameras, but keeps the question-and-answer sessions short.
</P>
<P>
   The money: Kournikova's career earnings of $754,832 pay the
bills, but the bulk of her income, an estimated $2 million a year,
comes from deals with Adidas and Yonex.
</P>
<P>
   The outlook: Kournikova hasn't won a tournament yet, and she'll
need to someday or her fame will fade. Expect comparisons with
Gabriela Sabatini, a U.S. Open champ at age 20 who peaked at No. 3.
Kournikova is much more driven than the Argentine, though.
</P>
<P>
   Venus and Serena Williams
</P>
<P>
   The facts: Venus was born June 17, 1980, in Lynwood, Calif.;
Serena Sept. 26, 1981, in Saginaw, Mich., and they're the youngest
of five sisters; they reside in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., with
their parents, Richard and Oracene; Venus is 6-feet-1 1/2, 168
pounds, Serena 5-10, 145; both play right-handed with a two-handed
backhand; coached by their parents; Venus is ranked No. 5, Serena
No. 19, both career highs.
</P>
<P>
   The legend: Raised in Compton, Calif., the sisters practiced in
public parks with gunfire sounding and gangs fighting in the
background. At least that's one of Richard Williams' versions.
Calling his girls ``the ghetto Cinderellas,'' Mr. Williams moved
the family, at the sisters' request, to Palm Beach Gardens, Fla.,
where Rick Macci became an unsung influence in their tennis
development. The sisters stopped playing junior tennis when Venus
was 12 and Serena 11.
</P>
<P>
   The games: Both players have powerful groundstrokes and
all-court games. Serena is faster, but Venus covers as much court
with her long arms. Venus has the game's fastest serve. Since
November, Serena has shot from No. 304 to the top 20 in less than a
year and before her 17th birthday, quicker than Venus did it. Venus
was essentially a part-timer last year, as well, but made the U.S.
Open final. This year, she's won the Lipton, beaten Martina Hingis
twice and reached a career-high No. 5.
</P>
<P>
   The personalities: There's lots of nonsense and giggling from
the sisters and anyone who engages them. The media often try to
goad them into boasting or inciting remarks, but they're wise to
that now and steer the conversation their way, often to their
schoolwork. Serena can be moody in defeat, though.
</P>
<P>
   The money: Venus has earned $1,208,244 on the tour and takes in
another $3 million annually through Reebok. Serena is at $251,428
in earnings, and it's estimated she gets between $1 million and $2
million a year in endorsements, primarily through Puma.
</P>
<P>
   The outlook: Both have unlimited potential. Either could become
one of the all-time greats, with Venus favored by most because of
her serve and ultimate potential to develop into a dominant net
player. Richard Williams once said Serena was the better of the
two, but most recently he said, ``Venus is it, and she'll always be
it.''

POLYGAMOUS (Colorado City, Ariz. ) _ It was 4:25 p.m. at Justin's
house and the welcome call ``Come to dinner!'' went out over the
intercom. From all over the 35,000 square-foot, 31-bedroom home the
kids came pouring into the cafeteria-sized dining room. Justin, 45,
sat and smiled amid the clang of silverware and plates as many of
his 10 wives and 28 children consumed the contents of three
casserole dishes of enchiladas. Justin is not his real name; he
asked that he and his wives remain anonymous in exchange for
granting a rare glimpse of polygamous life in this fiercely
secretive community on the Utah-Arizona border. By MARK SHAFFER.

 &QL; 
FUNDAMENTAL (Colorado City, Ariz.) _ Wayne LeBaron sat on the couch
snuggling with his new bride and shook his head at the strangeness
of it all. LeBaron, who lives at the foot of a strawberry-colored
cliff near this remote polygamist town, knew something was stirring
within the ranks of the Old World _ the fundamentalist Mormons who
control the community. Then the packages started arriving _ sent to
LeBaron's ranch for safekeeping from the family of his wife, who
was raised in Colorado City.Some contained cassette tapes of
popular music. Others had jewelry. But all had one thing in common,
he said: They are considered contraband by the fundamentalist
Mormon leadership that LeBaron says has recently been reverting to
an even more conservative religious stance. By MARK SHAFFER. Story

 &QL; 
RANCHQ&AMP;A _ Arizona Boys Ranch president Bob Thomas admitted to
state investigators that serious management failures and employee
misconduct led up to the death of a 16-year-old Sacramento boy in
March. However, during an interview with Child Protective Services,
Thomas suggested that others share blame for the tragedy of
Nicholaus Contreraz, who died of lung failure while being forced to
exercize at the camp for delinquent boys. Thomas' comments are
drawn from a two-hour interview last month with CPS investigators
from the Arizona Department of Economic Security, which Wednesday
announced it is denying Boys Ranch's license due to a pattern of
abuse and neglect. By DENNIS WAGNER. Story will move in the ``A''

CAMPAIGN (undated) _ After two teenage pages accused him of making
improper sexual advances, Arizona Rep. Richard Kyle did what most
people would do _ he hired an attorney. Then he did what most
people can't. He dipped into his campaign kitty and pulled out $360
to pay his legal fees. Kyle, an Ahwatukee Republican, also used
contributors' funds to hire baby-sitters; rent golf clubs; pay his
AAA membership; travel to New Orleans and La Jolla, Calif.; and buy
$125 worth of gifts three days before Christmas. And it's all
legal. By MICHAEL MURPHY. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL;

STATE30 (undated) _ In a state that has bounced two governors from
office in 10 years, the race for Secretary of State _ next in line

in this year's Republican primaries have one of the more intriguing
contests for an otherwise unheralded office. The differences
between Frances Emma Barwood and Betsy Bayless could not be more

LEPAGE HAVING THE RIDE OF HIS LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ Kevin Lepage is a real-life rags-to-riches story,
the latest one in the rich tableau of the NASCAR Winston Cup
Series.
</P>
<P>
   A 36-year-old native of Shelburne, Vt., Lepage forged a name for
himself on the Busch North Series before he and his wife, Donna,
headed south in 1994 to seek fame and fortune on the Busch Grand
National circuit. But once they arrived, they encountered one
hardship after another.
</P>
<P>
   That was before Lepage got the biggest break of his career two
months ago, landing a Winston Cup ride in the No. 16 Primestar Ford
Taurus owned by Jack Roush. Before then, his prospects had been
bleak. His financial situation was even bleaker. Lepage even
scavenged his Mooresville, N.C., home for spare change so he could
afford to take his wife out to dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely been an emotional career, coming down here in
1994 with the help of Vermont Teddy Bear,'' said Lepage, who wound
up campaigning an unsponsored car after losing his Vermont-based
sponsor. ``But, you know, with limited funding, we had a limited
crew and limited resources. When it was all said and done in 1996,
when we didn't have a sponsor running the first seven races, we
decided there was room for us in NASCAR. We just didn't know where,
but we were going to do what we had to do in order to stay in the
business even if I had to become a mechanic or if I had to pick and
choose the races I ran.''
</P>
<P>
   Lepage had to make sacrifices.

   ``We went through the whole '94 season and part of '95 without a
stove in the house,'' said Lepage, who is planning to build a new
home for his family near Mooresville. ``We were living off our
charcoal grill and a little hot plate. We were driving around with
vehicles that had 100,000-plus miles on them. It was just so many
things like that, that people don't realize.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell the story, and a lot of people laugh at it, but it's a
true story. In '94 and '95, when I felt my wife deserved a night
out, we used to have to roll our quarters, dimes, and nickels and
go out to dinner, because we didn't have the money and our credit
cards were all maxed out. Those are the kinds of sacrifices we had
to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Lepage sacrifices no more, as Ted Musgrave's successor in the
No. 16 Primestar Ford. But Lepage, who hopes to become the first
Vermonter to win a Winston Cup race, didn't make the quantum leap
of his career until first landing a Busch Grand National ride with
David Ridling, which led to an opportunity to drive an unsponsored
car for Joe Falk on the Winston Cup circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Lepage impressed quite a few Winston Cup owners when he managed
to qualify Falk's car in 16 of the first 17 races of the season,
posting a pair of Top 14 finishes, at the Primestar 500 in Atlanta
and the Diehard 500 at Talladega.
</P>
<P>
   Taking note of his resiliency, Dale Earnhardt called Lepage
about the possibility of filling in for injured driver Steve Park.
Once word began to circulate around the garage about Earnhardt's
feeler, Lepage soon heard from other owners such as Felix Sabates
and Rick Hendrick. Then Roush, owner of a five-car stable led by
Mark Martin and Jeff Burton, called with an offer Lepage couldn't
refuse: the chance to drive the 16 car beginning in August.
</P>
<P>
   Problem was, when Falk learned about the deal, Lepage was
released from his ride before the race at Sonoma, Calif. He was
without a ride for five weeks, including the July 11 Winston Cup
race at New Hampshire International Speedway, where he was
relegated to be a spectator.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very emotional feeling to come back this weekend,
because we had a lot of family and friends purchase tickets for the
(July) New Hampshire race,'' said Lepage, who will get his chance
Sunday at NHIS, where he qualified 33d-fastest (with a lap of
126.913 m.p.h.) in Saturday's second round of qualifying for the
Farm Aid on CMT 300. ``Obviously, I was in limbo there and wasn't
driving anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of disappointed people. They either sold their
tickets or they just didn't come down to the race because I wasn't
driving. Now to go back there with the Primestar team and Jack
Roush _ with teammates such as Mark Martin, Jeff Burton, Johnny
Benson, and Chad Little _ is going to be a great opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Teamed with crew chief James Ince, Lepage took over the No. 16
ride two weeks ago at Michigan, where he started 39th and finished
17th, then posted his first Top 10 effort of the season in a Roush
car with a 10th last Saturday night at Bristol, Tenn., where
teammates Martin and Burton finished 1-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great opportunity,'' said Lepage. ``It's all been
worth it, because today we're in a stable situation with Jack Roush
and the Primestar team. It just shows that if you're willing to
sacrifice, and give up a lot of things, and get back up every time
you're knocked down _ instead of just laying there and saying,
`Man, I'm done,' _ that there's room in Winston Cup racing for a
driver like Kevin Lepage.''

   &UR; Jeff Gordon  &LR; to Formula One? While it's true that the two-time
Winston Cup champion was approached about _ and politely declined _
a chance to race on the worldwide circuit, crew chief  &UR; Ray Evernham
 &LR; seems to believe it's not such a far-fetched idea. ``He's 27 years
old,'' Evernham said. ``I think the longer he's in a Winston Cup,
the more he's going to be here forever. But I'm a race fan first
and in the business second. Everybody wants to see another American
Formula One champion. I certainly do. The last one to do that was
 &UR; Mario  &LR; ( &UR; Andretti &LR; ). Selfishly, hey, let's face it, the kid's my
meal ticket. He pays my mortgage. But, as a friend, I don't know.
Someday if he was good enough and the opportunity was right, I
could see him being a world champion. I think he's talented
enough.'' So what about it, Jeff? ``It would be like starting all
over again for me,'' he said. ``I'm in that comfort zone right now
where I have a lot of confidence in my driving and my ability and
my race team. For me, Formula One is interesting and it's great
that people recognize me and the accomplishments I've had, but I
really don't think it's a realistic thing for me.''

   After  &UR; Ricky Craven  &LR; made a triumphant comeback from
postconcussion syndrome by winning the pole for the Jiffy Lube 300
in July,  &UR; Jimmy Spencer  &LR; tried to follow suit, chosing NHIS as the
site of his comeback from a concussion that forced him out of the
No. 23 Winston No Bull 5 Ford Taurus at the Aug. 9 Bud At The Glen
in Watkins Glen, N.Y. Suffering from severe headaches, Spencer was
replaced by ARCA driver  &UR; Frank Kimmel  &LR; in the Pepsi 400 at Michigan
two weeks ago, and by Musgrave in last week's Goody's Headache
Powder 500 at Bristol. After gaining medical clearance, Spencer got
back into his car Friday at NHIS, practiced, and qualified 17th for
Sunday's race with a lap of 127.036 m.p.h. ``You never forget how
to ride a bike,'' said Spencer, who is 17th in the point standings
with 2,249. ``I've gotta thank Team Winston and the support I got
from the fans. Teddy Musgrave did a great job. He helped us here
this week and he's gonna help us again. We had a problem in the
last hour (of Friday's practice). We really felt like we should
have ran faster. We had a transmission or U-joint break and it
really hurt us, but I think that will put us in the Top 20 and
that's a good start coming back.'' Spencer did suffer a setback in
Saturday's practice session when he crashed his primary car,
forcing him to start a backup from the rear of the 43-car field.
``It seems if you get out of the groove a little bit you're in
no-man's land, and I think that's what happened,'' he said.

TUNNEL DIDN'T TAKE TOLL ON US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``No problem,'' said Globe photographer Stan Grossfeld as he
steered through the third harbor tunnel. ``We've got the Power of
Ted.''
</P>
<P>
   The Power of Ted.
</P>
<P>
   On assignment in Hernando, Fla., early Wednesday, Stan and I
spoke with Ted Williams about his famous Boston tunnel. Ted was a
man of the people, after all, and it seems a shame that the tunnel,
at most hours, is restricted to cabs, commercial vehicles, and East
Boston residents with special stickers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know, just cabs and official cars,'' Ted said with a sigh.
``That's too bad. But you know, I'm really kind of proud of that
tunnel. And still I say with a sense of sorrow that the guy who did
such a hell of a thing on that, the governor of the state (William
Weld), isn't the governor anymore. He should have been there for
life. I've only been up there a couple of times, but I go through
it every time.''
</P>
<P>
   I told Ted that my goal in life was to give him a ride to Logan
in my 1987 Toyota. It would be illegal, of course, but imagine
getting pulled over and telling the cop, ``Oh yeah, well guess
who've I've got riding shotgun here? Ted Williams himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted laughed and said, ``They'd probably look at me and say, `Who
the hell is that guy?'''
</P>
<P>
   Armed with the tape of Ted talking about his tunnel, and some
store-bought items from his museum, we had to try. We wanted to be
the first Bostonians to sit at Ted Williams's breakfast table in
the morning, then pass through the Ted Williams Tunnel in Boston's
rush hour.
</P>
<P>
   It was cake. At 5:05 p.m., we paid $2 at the tunnel entrance and
the toll-taker said nothing. A State Police vehicle passed in front
of us before we pulled away from the booth. A nitwit in the next
lane hit his horn and pointed at us in a lame effort to rat us out,
but the trooper ignored the tattletale.
</P>
<P>
   And so we cruised through the Ted Williams Tunnel at warp speed
and were home by 5:30, while the law-abiding folk sat stalled in
the Sumner.
</P>
<P>
   We had the Power of Ted.

DONATO SKATES IN CIRCLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He has been content to stay on the back burner, He has remained
quiet throughout the summer, spending time with his wife and two
sons. A third child is due in October. He has worked a bit on his
golf game and has started skating at Boston University, making the
long trek each day from his Scituate home.
</P>
<P>
   The offseason has been pretty much business as usual for Bruins
forward Ted Donato, except for one thing: He doesn't know where
he'll be when training camp opens Sept. 12. The restricted free
agent has no contract at the moment and isn't sure whether Boston
plans to retain his services or sign him and swap him to another
team.
</P>
<P>
   Donato, who had a promising start but rough second half last
season, asked in March to be traded if he wasn't in coach Pat
Burns's plans. Management said it would take the request under
advisement, and it appeared for a time that Donato might be moved
at the trade deadline. It didn't happen, though, and Donato has
renewed his request to be moved if he won't get a clean slate when
veterans report to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit in a holding pattern,'' said Donato.
``Obviously they have four or five guys to sign and they have a lot
of decisions to make. I'm not sure they know exactly what they want
and I'm not sure I know exactly what I want. We'll see what
happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``My motive is just to work as hard as I can, come in in great
shape and get off to a good start and have a good season. I don't
think it's any secret that I love being a Boston Bruin. Having
success in Boston would be sweeter than having it anyplace else.
Having said that, I want to play where I think I have the best
opportunity. That's the bottom line and that's what both sides are
trying to come to a mutual agreement with. Money hasn't been a
sticking point. Opportunity and status have been more the catching
point right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Donato finished seventh on the team in scoring last year,
tallying 16 goals and 39 points in 79 games. What's more telling is
his production if you divide the season into pre- and
post-suspension. Donato missed three games because of a
high-sticking incident against the Islanders' Rich Pilon Dec. 20
that drew a match penalty for intent to injure.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 35 games before the suspension, Donato had 14 goals
and 13 assists. In the 43 games after it, he had two goals and just
12 points. In fairness, Donato's ice time greatly diminished in the
second half, and it's hard to determine whether his play fell off
as a result of less ice time, or if his minutes were reduced
because his play had fallen off. There was speculation that Donato
was affected adversely by the suspension and changed his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reject that as a reason,'' said Donato. ``You play this
game, there are things that go in your favor and things you have to
overcome or get through. Everybody during the season has one or two
little ruts where you don't play as well and you have to battle
through it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past I've always worked through little slumps and
things like that. Obviously I didn't come out of last year's the
way I wanted to, but that's in the past. I'm looking to the future.
I don't think it made me a different player at all. It made my
attitude a little bit different. It's made me hungrier coming back
into camp. As far as any change in the way I play, I think that's
ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the uncertainty, Donato said he has had a good summer of
working out and preparing for the season. At 29, he feels he still
has plenty to prove.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year I was happy with the start,'' he said. ``From about
the halfway point, I didn't play as well and it continued on for
most of the second half of the season. I don't think it does
anybody a great deal of good to wonder what came first, the chicken
or the egg. Did I start playing poorly and then not playing as much
or was I not playing as much and then not playing as well?
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought there were stretches where I played fairly well and
I wasn't able to get back to the same position I was in early in
the season and that's the bottom line. I wasn't happy with it. I'm
not naive enough to think that I shouldn't have played better. It's
something that pushed me harder all summer to work hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The question remains, where does Donato fit in here? The answer
depends partly on Burns's decision on his lines. If everyone is
signed, you'll likely see Jason Allison centering Sergei Samsonov
and Dmitri Khristich again. For the second scoring line, a possible
effective combination is Joe Thornton (who definitely will get a
shot at center duty here) between veterans Steve Heinze and Donato.
Anson Carter will challenge for a spot on that line but Carter, at
24, isn't yet the player Donato is, in terms of either versatility
or hockey sense.
</P>
<P>
   The peril of trading Donato is that the Bruins don't want to
swap a dime for two nickels. When asked what would happen in a
perfect world, Donato laughed and said, ``I'm not sure I know.
That's probably part of the problem, and I'm sure that's probably
part of the problem with both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't made any demands. I tried to let them know I wasn't
happy with the second half of the season for a number of reasons.
Let's face it, they weren't happy, either. They'd probably rather
have me play a lot better than I did also.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think from an organizational standpoint they have to find
out what they want with everybody and go from there. I'm not real
keen on sitting out because it's not a money issue. I'm probably
not their first priority. If they say, `Sign a contract and show us
you deserve to play more,' that's what will happen. I've never been
afraid to earn my keep. It's something I'm not afraid of.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been private speculation among some players that
Do-nato is liked by upper management but not as much by Burns.
Donato declined to address that. Assistant GM Mike O'Connell said
that while management signs the players, Burns decides how they'll
be used.
</P>
<P>
   ``That part has been entrusted to him,'' said O'Connell. ``He's
been named Coach of the Year three times. I think he knows what
he's doing.''
</P>

   Among the many players taking to the BU ice in preparation for
the opening of camps is Bruins goalie  &UR; Byron Dafoe &LR; . On Thursday,
Dafoe skated for just the second time since having offseason
surgery on his left shoulder. Dafoe, who saw team doctor  &UR; Bert
Zarins  &LR; on Wednesday, said not only is he ahead of schedule but he
fully intends to be ready for the start of the season and likely
the second half of camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first few times, skating is tough whether you're injured
or not,'' said Dafoe, whose brown hair is now streaked with gold as
the result of an offseason spent in Southern California. ``I'm not
supposed to be going 100 percent but I don't know how a goalie
doesn't go 100 percent. The first hour was spent (facing) shots and
it was great. I had no problems whatsoever. But this kind of
shinny, you can't go 100 percent because you can pull your groin. I
mean, these guys make nine passes before they get to the crease.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe said he has 85 percent range of motion in the shoulder,
which is his glove side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very encouraged and I'm looking forward to the start of
camp,'' he said. ``A month from now, I'll be 100 percent. That puts
us two weeks into camp. My therapist and the doctor who did the
surgery in LA said they're really amazed at how quick it's come.
Now we know we're OK timewise, so there's no need to push it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked hard, I really did. There were days I could've said,
`That's far enough,' but I was very motivated to make sure I was
ready for camp and the start of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   His progress has provided a bonus. After the surgery, Dafoe said
his biggest disappointment was not being able to play beach
volleyball. But for the last couple of weeks before heading back
here, he was able to.
</P>
<P>
   ``They call me the Sand Spider,'' said Dafoe. ``I can't spike
because it's too high to jump. But I can dig.''
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Talk about your strange offseasons. Devils forward  &UR; Jason
Arnott &LR;  has a new contract but likely won't be ready for the
opening of camp because of a freak fishing accident. In Sudbury,
Ontario, Arnott's left index finger was broken by a fish hook. He
had surgery but when that failed to fix the problem, he had another
operation and is scheduled to be in a cast until mid-September ...
Two NHL coaches will have their sons in training camp this year.
 &UR; Shaun Sutter &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who was drafted by the Flames, will be in
Calgary's camp with coach  &UR; Brian &LR; . In New Jersey, new Devils coach
 &UR; Robbie Ftorek  &LR; will have 23-year-old  &UR; Sam  &LR; in on a free-agent
tryout ... St. Louis goalie  &UR; Grant Fuhr &LR; , a scratch golfer, isn't
ready to hang up the skates, but he declares that golf really is
his first love at the moment. He holds out hope of it being his
next profession. ``Sure, I'd love to play in the PGA, but making
the (Canadian Pro Golf Association) tour is my first goal,'' Fuhr
told reporters at a recent charity tournament. ``I'd like to try
for the CPGA next year but it depends on the playoffs and how much
I play. I just love the game.'' Fuhr estimates his collection of
golf memorabilia is valued at $200,000, and that doesn't include
his collection of equipment ... Former Bruin  &UR; Randy Burridge  &LR; is
looking for a new team. The 32-year-old left wing, who played for
the Sabres the last three years, had the final year of his contract
bought out and is now an unrestricted free agent. He has been
skating and working out at BU along with many others, including
former Bruin  &UR; Jeff Lazaro &LR; . Lazaro, who was the top scorer for the
ECHL's New Orleans Brass with 101 points, will be in camp with the
Red Wings next month and is set to vie for a spot on the Adirondack
roster ... In honor of their 75th season, the Bruins will hold a
few special events. For example, on Oct. 12, when the club hosts
the Islanders in a 1:30 game, the first 5,000 children ages 14 and
under will receive a Beanie Baby _ Blackie the Bear _ which comes
with a commemorative card. Also, if at any time during the 1998-99
season (Oct. 10-April 18), you turn 75 years old, just show some
identification with your birthdate and you'll receive two free
tickets to a selected game ... 41 days to opening night.

DITKA FINDS HE HAS MORE SINNERS THAN SAINTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Ditka used to coach Da Bears. These days he's coaching Duh
Saints.
</P>
<P>
   When 20 or more Saints formed a gauntlet in a darkened dormitory
hallway in the wee hours of the morning of Aug. 20 and beat five
rookies as they were sent down it with pillowcases over their
heads, those players said several things about themselves.
</P>
<P>
   They said they were immature, stupid, apparently deaf, certainly
not saints, and men with no idea how a team is created. What they
did not say, however, was that they were racists.
</P>
<P>
   Because four of the five rookies were white and the majority of
those forming the gauntlet were not, the assumption by many was
that this was a racially motivated assault. This impression was
created after rookie tight end Cam Cleeland suffered blurred vision
after allegedly being struck in the face with a sock full of
quarters and free agent Jeff Danish crashed through a window trying
to charge to freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Both rookies were white, and Cleeland's father immediately
condemned the assault (as he should have) and assumed the worst
about it (which was understandable but unfortunate). After talking
to his son, he told the media that white rookies had been singled
out for a beating by black veterans.
</P>
<P>
   While that remains a slim possibility, Saints president and
general manager Bill Kuharich said Friday that four other rookies
were waiting to enter the gauntlet after Danish went through the
window, causing the geniuses involved to conclude that someone
could get hurt. The remaining rookies in line were black, but they
were spared their indignity because someone had to fish poor Danish
from the shards of broken glass and get him to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Danish sustained a 13-stitch cut that reopened five plays into
the Aug. 22 exhibition game against the Tennessee Oilers and thus
he ended his professional football career a bloody mess. He was
released several days later after refusing to tell Ditka or
Kuharich which veterans were involved.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, that code of silence is more damning than the
beating for Ditka, because anyone can be stupid for a half-hour but
it's another thing to stonewall your boss for days to protect
people who don't deserve protection and know you can get away with
it.
</P>
<P>
   Ditka and Kuharich questioned not only the rookies but many
veterans and the result was shocking to Kuharich, who never saw
anything like this at Dartmouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``They closed ranks on me and Mike,'' Kuharich said. ``I
couldn't believe it. They refused to say anything. I'm irate over
this. Mike is irate. The owner is irate. We're all upset that
people would treat other people this way, and we're trying to deal
with it head-on. This is not a boys-will-be-boys approach, but it's
difficult when you can't get any proof of who was involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hoped they wouldn't close ranks, that someone would come
forward and handle this among the players and that we would get
some sort of direction about who was involved. When Mike tried,
they just said, `We can't do that, Coach.'''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently they said the same thing when Ditka, who had gotten
wind that something might be up, warned his players at a 7 p.m.
team meeting not to get involved in any hazing. A year earlier, a
raucous hazing incident on the last night of camp caused damage to
several dorm rooms at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, where
the Saints train, and Ditka made it clear this was not to be
repeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``He addressed it,'' said Kuharich. ``They listened but they
didn't hear.''
</P>
<P>
   His players didn't hear Mike Ditka? The same Ditka who used to
be able to freeze a player in his tracks with one look when he was
stalking the Bears sideline?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, when Ditka talks these days, no one listens. Or if
they do, they react like a linebacker named Andre Royal. They talk
back, as Royal did two weeks ago when Ditka shouted at him about
always being hurt and Royal shouted back just as loud for several
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   What worse can be said of a coach than that his players don't
follow his instructions and give him lip in public when he berates
them?
</P>
<P>
   This is not to blame Ditka for the stupidity of his players last
week, even though he's the one who hired them. But if they refuse
to listen to his stern warnings or answer his questions, just how
much respect do they have for him?
</P>
<P>
   Kuharich says he is waiting for a report from NFL Security
people, who last week questioned all the rookies, including the
ones who had been released, as well as a dozen veterans. As of
Friday, Kuharich had not been told what they learned, but it should
be noted that this is the same NFL Security that looked into the
case of Dallas's Everett McIver ending up with a pair of shears
stuck in his neck and concluded it was ``horseplay.''
</P>
<P>
   Another word starting with ``horse'' would seem more
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what NFL Security or the Saints come up with,
Kuharich understands what this looks like on the outside, although
he's powerless to do much about it.

   ``It's not like we can just go out and start cutting people,''
Kuharich said. ``What would the NFLPA do then? Say nobody comes
forward and we start cutting players until someone comes forward
when we can't prove the people were even involved. That won't stand
up for two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no excuse for this. It shows we have a lack of
leadership here (among the players). This was out of hand even if
nobody got hurt. Nobody stood up and said, `This is out of
control,' and that's wrong. But what do you do? Fire them all?''
</P>
<P>
   That would be a start, but obviously that is not an option for
the silent Saints, whose season begins in seven days. But the coach
of Duh Saints has to be asking himself a similar question these
days.
</P>
<P>
   He has to be wondering, ``What would Mike Ditka do in a case
like this?''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever finally comes of this _ and it's not likely to be much
if left in the hands of NFL (In)Security _ this much is sure: The
Saints won't have to make a highlight film this year, because
Hollywood already made it for them.

   It was called, ``Dumb and Dumber.''

   It wasn't a bad week for the defending Super Bowl champion
Broncos but it was a tough one for their Super Bowl trophy. While
on display at the Colorado State Fair in Pueblo, the trophy fell
out of a display case and ended up with a thumb-sized dent ...
After a summer trying to fight off age and youth at the same time,
veteran Denver defensive back  &UR; Tyrone Braxton  &LR; lost his strong
safety position to rookie  &UR; Eric Brown  &LR; after nine years as a
starter. The second-round choice from Mississippi State will start
Sept. 7 vs. the Patriots to open the season. Braxton has started
since 1989, first at corner and the last three seasons alongside
 &UR; Steve Atwater  &LR; at safety ... Apparently not fearing the kind of
public scrutiny  &UR; Bill Clinton  &LR; has faced, former Patriots ladies
man  &UR; Russ Francis  &LR; is running for Honolulu City Council ... What do
holdouts  &UR; Joe Johnson &LR; , &UR; Dan Williams &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Andre Wadsworth  &LR; have
in common? How about playing defensive end and having  &UR; Roosevelt
Barnes  &LR; (an associate of  &UR; Eugene Parker &LR; ) as their agent? Things
have gotten so absurd in New Orleans that Johnson rejected a deal
that would have made him the third-highest-paid defensive player in
football despite never getting a Pro Bowl vote. The Saints have on
the table a five-year deal worth $21.125 million that includes a $6
million signing bonus and a base salary of $2.6 million this
season. Only  &UR; Bruce Smith  &LR; and  &UR; Willie McGinest  &LR; make more, yet the
Saints believe Johnson may sit out the season and are trying to
trade him. ``They're asking for north of McGinest,'' Kuharich said.
``We sent him our offer and they sent us back  &UR; Sean Gilbert's &LR; .''
Gilbert's was a seven-year, $47 million bonanza with $8 million up
front from Carolina that came after he sat out last season.
Kuharich pointed out to Barnes that Gilbert also had been to the
Pro Bowl three times. When Miami defensive tackle  &UR; Tim
Bowens &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who like Johnson and Williams was a franchise player
refusing to accept his tender offer, agreed to a five-year, $25
million deal, Kuharich thought the market had been clearly
established. Barnes did not agree, and so an impasse that could
ruin whatever chance the Saints have of being competitive
continues. The Saints' strength was supposed to be defense and a
young offensive line, but they lost linebacker  &UR; Winford Tubbs  &LR; and
cornerback  &UR; Eric Allen  &LR; and now have their best lineman threatening
a season-long holdout. Kuharich believes Barnes's strategy will
backfire if Johnson tries to hold out all year because ``the only
guy who ever overcame the system that way was Gilbert. He got $14
million up front. That's all Roosevelt Barnes is pointing to. But
Gilbert can't live up to that contract no matter what he does, and
that will have an effect next year. I don't see anyone doing that
again.''

   Despite having spent millions on free agent defensive tackles
 &UR; Dana Stubblefield  &LR; and  &UR; Dan Wilkinson  &LR; in the offseason, the
Redskins were exploring trade possibilities for Johnson or
Williams. A source in the Washington organization said they are
still hoping to trade several draft picks to Kansas City for the
negotiating rights to Williams or to the Saints for Johnson before
the season opens, although Washington's refusal to meet New
Orleans's demand for two first-round draft choices makes a Johnson
deal unlikely. Washington did offer a first and third to New
Orleans. Before the Redskins would make a trade, they would insist
on making a deal with either player first. Washington was granted
the right to negotiate with both last week ... When  &UR; Gary Zimmerman
 &LR; reaffirmed his retirement from the Broncos, no one was more
unhappy about it than Pro Bowl center  &UR; Tom Nalen &LR; . Nalen is now
faced with the possibility of being shifted to guard after just
beginning to blossom at center last season. The situation for Nalen
worsened a week ago when starting guard  &UR; David Diaz-Infante
 &LR; sprained his right knee during a pass-protection drill and could
be lost for three weeks ... The sad case of  &UR; Yatil Green &LR;  is a
major blow to Miami's plans. The wide receiver will miss his second
straight season after rupturing the anterior cruciate ligament in
his right knee. Coach  &UR; Jimmy Johnson  &LR; desperately needed Green's
deep speed to open up defenses and create room for his running
game. Now Green is gone, and doctors say his chance of full
recovery after the original graft ruptured has shrunk from 95
percent to 75 percent. This was Green's fourth knee surgery in 13
months. He originally hurt himself last summer and had a graft
done. When the knee continued to bother him this summer, he had
additional surgery to repair a torn cartilage following an Aug. 1
scrimmage. Green reportedly was reluctant to return to practice so
soon after the second surgery but was medically cleared. He was
injured again that day without being hit. Naturally the Dolphins'
medical staff says all operations were a success and Green was not
rushed back on the field. Tell that to his lawyer, because
eventually they'll be talking to one ... Redskins guard  &UR; Bob Dahl
 &LR; has been on a roller coaster that finally came to a halt last week
when he was put on injured reserve for the season after undergoing
knee surgery. He had already been cut once and signed twice by
Washington ... Longtime Vikings front-office operative  &UR; Jeff
Diamond  &LR; met Friday with new owner  &UR; Red McCombs &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and it is
believed that Diamond will end up being named general manager.
Since he was all but running the place during the offseason when
the Vikings successfully re-signed their top five players, he has
earned the job.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Remember  &UR; Jamie Brown &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the big tackle acquired by the 49ers
for a second-round pick who spent much of the summer troubled by a
hamstring that led him to skip the exhibition game against the
Patriots? Well, after letting Brown go home for a week to ponder
his future, the Niners named untested  &UR; Dave Fiore  &LR; as their starter
even though he has yet to start an NFL game. Brown's reaction? He
was late to another exhibition game and now is under suspension.
Meanwhile, Fiore follows the oddest of roads to the NFL. He was a
nonscholarship player at Hofstra who was released halfway through
his rookie year in San Francisco in 1996. He was signed by the Jets
last summer but injured his knee and took a settlement before
re-signing with the 49ers and spending all of last year on injured
reserve ... Buccaneers management has taken much the same approach
to their young team as  &UR; Bob Kraft  &LR; has with the Patriots. They've
rewritten nine contracts the past two years, paying out $23.9
million in signing bonuses to keep their young players away from
free agency ... The NFL now has its first ``free agent''
cheerleader.  &UR; Lisa Ligon &LR; , &UR;  &LR; 23, spent three years with the Redskins
but is now cheering for, of all teams, the Cowboys ... On Friday
night, the Packers played their second road game in four days,
ending an arduous preseason travel schedule. They went to Japan to
open the summer and closed by playing in Denver Tuesday night,
flying home to Green Bay for one day of practice and then flying to
Miami Thursday for Friday night's game ... The Packers finally came
to terms with holdout running back  &UR; Dorsey Levens &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the first
skill-position player to miss every exhibition game in Green Bay
since  &UR; Mike Holmgren  &LR; took over as coach seven years ago. During
the standoff, an NFC rival postulated, ``If they just forgot him
and went with  &UR; Travis Jervey &LR; , &UR;  &LR; a year from now people would be
saying, `Whatever happened to Dorsey Levens?' With their
quarterback and their defense and those receivers, whoever runs
there will get yards. If  &UR; Edgar Bennett  &LR; hadn't snapped his
Achilles' a year ago, Dorsey Levens doesn't get off the bench.''
... With Pro Bowl offensive lineman  &UR; Larry Allen  &LR; becoming the
latest Cowboy on the police blotter, one wonders whether their
games will be televised by Fox or Court TV this season ... Some NFL
insiders fear that billionaire  &UR; Al Lerner  &LR; has the inside track on
landing the expansion Cleveland franchise because he has been
joined by former 49ers president  &UR; Carmen Policy  &LR; and has friends at
the investment firm Goldman Sachs that is brokering the deal. Other
insiders insist that nothing could be further from the truth,
because even though Policy is well respected around the league,
more than a few clubs have long been resentful of his ability to
manipulate the salary cap to his team's advantage and they are not
looking forward to letting him back into the fraternity. And others
feel that Lerner helped create this mess in the first place when he
was a minority owner of the original Browns. It was on Lerner's
private jet that  &UR; Art Modell  &LR; flew secretly to Maryland to sign the
deal that allowed him to bolt to Baltimore, much to the shock of
Cleveland's loyal fans. Still, Lerner has a reported net worth of
$2.5 billion, the endorsement of Cleveland Mayor  &UR; Michael
White &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and the benefit of Policy's expertise in league politics,
and that may be all he needs when the owners vote Sept. 8.

   In case you missed it, a federal judge in Philadelphia has
allowed a lawsuit to go forward that could prove significant to NFL
fans. The antitrust suit, filed by one fan in Pennsylvania and two
more in New Jersey, claims the NFL is illegally forcing fans to
subscribe to DirecTV's Sunday Ticket pay-cable broadcasts. The suit
contends that NFL teams are limiting the number of games on free
TV, thus forcing fans of teams who live out of a particular
franchise's immediate area to spend $139 a season or more to get
the Sunday Ticket. The NFL had asked that the suit to be dismissed,
claiming the Sports Broadcasting Act's antitrust exemption for
``sponsored broadcasts'' on free TV protected Sunday Ticket. But US
District Court Judge  &UR; Robert S. Gawthrop III  &LR; ruled that having
free broadcasts in limited markets was not enough to protect the
DirecTV feeds from antitrust challenges and the suit could go
forward. Stay tuned, so to speak ... If you don't think the times
are a-changing in the NFL, consider this. The Bears are planning a
Beanie Baby giveaway this season to boost ticket sales and the
Buccaneers' new stadium will include a 43-ton steel and concrete
replica of a pirate ship above one end zone that will fire soft
footballs from eight cannons when the Bucs score. Remember when
people filled NFL stadiums just to watch the game ... Ever the
philosopher, twice-suspended running back  &UR; Bam Morris  &LR; had this to
say after finally landing a job with Chicago: ``I won't say it's
the best deal in the world, but it's a deal.'' If you got busted
twice for violating your boss's drug policy and spent 89 days in
jail for having six pounds of marijuana in the trunk of your
Mercedes, you'd think any deal would be a good deal, especially one
that's paying you $500,000 to back up a rookie ... Just asking, but
how come the Bears cut  &UR; Bryan Cox  &LR; because they felt he was too
much of a distraction and then signed a running back who has spent
more time on probation than in the NFL? ... Speaking of Cox, some
scouts say he appears to have lost his range and may be of little
use to the Jets. While many were surprised that  &UR; Bill Parcells
 &LR; would sign a player as prone to hotheadedness as Cox, they do have
common ground. Both own thoroughbreds. Cox has six, including two
that recently won stakes races in Florida ... When  &UR; Magic Johnson's
 &LR; show, ``The Magic Hour,'' was canceled, it served as an
inspiration to Saints linebacker  &UR; Brian Jones &LR; , the ultimate
``slash'' guy for these times. Jones, a football
player/model/actor, said recently, ``After watching Magic's show,
any doubts I might have had about my abilities are gone.'' This is
not a sympathetic young man.

ENTERTAINING IDEA: MCNEELEY VS. ESCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Boston liquor distributor Harvey Allen has a lot of money, and
apparently he'd like to lose some of it.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime sportsman, Allen is in the early stages of putting
together a $2 million proposal to stage a ``heavyweight title
fight'' between Medfield's Peter McNeeley and the self-styled
champion of the four-rounders, the 300-pound-plus Butterbean Esch.
</P>
<P>
   It is Allen's belief that he could pay each fighter $150,000
plus a percentage of the gross for an admittedly freakish fight he
thinks could lure upwards of 5,000 to the FleetCenter and thousands
more to pay $29.95 to watch on pay-per-view. If he's right, Lord
help us; but you have to admit, it's an intriguing concept. Sort of
the polar opposite of midget wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got some loose cash around and I've known Peter and his
father a long time,'' Allen said. ``I have a fondness for Vinny
(Vecchione, McNeeley's manager). He's tried to put this together
before, and I thought one way he could do this was to put real
money up.''
</P>
<P>
   In boxing, real money rules (and occasionally so does funny
money, which might be more apt in this case), but put up money for
what?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about Holyfield-Tyson,'' Vecchione conceded.
``I know that. But it would be entertainment. It's a funny thing.
It would draw an audience. Everybody would get a decent payday and
when the bell rings both guys would come out throwing. Anybody
who's seen either one of them knows that. Unlike a lot of guys
today, they come to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   True, but whether they can fight is another question, although
neither Allen nor Vecchione believes that would be the issue.
Rather, the question would be what kind of audience they're talking
about and how large that audience is.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Harvey Allen didn't get rich enough at M.S. Walker liquor
distributors to blow $2 million by not knowing what his audience
wants, and when it comes to the audience for such a match, he can
see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would be a weird twist to it,'' Allen conceded. ``If we
could make it kind of a circus atmosphere, almost a carnival
atmosphere, as the most fun night in boxing with things like a
Butterbean look-alike contest, it could draw a tremendous crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you'd get a crossover crowd. Boxing fans and wrestling
fans. What's wrong with combining the two?''
</P>
<P>
   If you're a boxing purist, there's a lot wrong with that, but
the purity of the sport began to slip a long time ago. Last Tuesday
night, for example, USA Network ended its 17-year weekly boxing
series not with a final rousing night at the fights but with a
retrospective of past bouts and a four-round fight in which
Butterbean knocked out a walking concussion named Tim Pollard in
less than a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Why did USA put on such a show, instead of a stirring match
between two young, unknown fighters? Because that's show biz, and
show biz too often sells better than good fights. Which is what
Allen and Vecchione would be counting on, isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only one boss in a thing like this,'' Allen said.
``Money. When you're willing to put some up, who knows what could
happen? Butterbean has never made $150,000. More than that is
sitting here for him. This could be the biggest all-time gate for a
four-round fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real money is in pay-per-view, but I believe it would do
well in Boston because people are looking for entertainment and
this would be entertainment. Besides, it would be a heavyweight
title fight. We'd make Butterbean go five or six rounds, not just
four. You know, championship distance.''
</P>
<P>
   Told of Allen's idea, Bob Arum, Butterbean's promoter, laughed
loudly until the numbers were mentioned. The instant he heard
$150,000 for the fighter and a $2 million promotion, Arum proved
that Allen's point may be well taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``With those numbers, you tell him to call me,'' Arum barked.
``Tell him to call me today.''
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Arum closed the deal for a Nov. 21 welterweight title fight
between World Boxing Council champion  &UR; Oscar De La Hoya  &LR; and
recently defrocked World Boxing Association champion  &UR; Ike Quartey
 &LR; Friday afternoon. The WBA stripped Quartey of its title when he
refused to defend it against No. 1 contender  &UR; Andrei Pastriev  &LR; and
instead pursued a bout with De La Hoya or International Boxing
Federation champion  &UR; Felix Trinidad &LR; . Quartey (34-0-1) had agreed
to fight Trinidad Nov. 14 but grew concerned last week that
Trinidad might not be able to free himself from the hold of
promoter  &UR; Don King  &LR; in time, so his representatives cut a deal with
De La Hoya that will pay Quartey $4 million, $2.1 million more than
he stood to make against the IBF champion. After the deal was
hammered out, the three promoters all claiming to own a piece of
Quartey met separately to iron out how they would divide their end
of the take. De La Hoya (28-0) has been chafing at the string of
nonchallenging challengers Arum has presented him, including former
legend  &UR; Julio Cesar Chavez &LR; . De La Hoya fights Chavez Sept. 18 in
Las Vegas, and if no problems come from that, he will go back into
training almost immediately for Quartey ... Speaking of fallen
legends,  &UR; Roberto Duran  &LR; came out of retirement six times. Friday
night proved to be one time too many. In no surprise, the
47-year-old Duran was blasted by a kid who in Duran's prime
wouldn't have dared throw a harsh look at him, never mind a punch.
But the greatest lightweight of all time is no longer light or
great, and so Duran had happen to him what has happened to so many
boxing greats. He was pummeled, this time by WBA mid-dleweight
champion  &UR; William Joppy &LR; , &UR;  &LR; a kid about whom there is nothing
special. Mercifully, it took just three rounds, but each one was
too long; it was painful to watch one of the greatest fighters of
all time being slapped helplessly around the ring at the Hilton in
Las Vegas. Perhaps Duran will finally stop, but don't count on it.
He still owes more than $300,000 in taxes, and he earned only
$250,000 Friday night _ before taxes. Now he fights not to win, but
loses to get paid. Sad. Very sad ... It was an up-and-down week for
the folks at HBO. They landed Quartey-De La Hoya on pay-per-view
but learned that an Oct. 24 bout for the vacant WBC junior
welterweight title between ex-world champions  &UR; Miguel Angel
Gonzalez  &LR; and  &UR; Kostya Tszyu  &LR; would have to be postponed because
Tszyu injured his hand. Also, heavyweight  &UR; Hasim Rahman  &LR; walked out
of camp while training for a Sept. 26 fight with  &UR; David Tua  &LR; on the
 &UR; Lennox Lewis &LR; - &UR; Zeljko Mavrovic  &LR; WBC title fight card. Rahman
returned a day later but the cable giant is now scrambling because
its backup plan was to schedule a title fight between IBF
middleweight champion  &UR; Bernard Hopkins  &LR; and  &UR; Otis Grant  &LR; to fill
the Tszyu-Gonzalez opening, but that went out the window Friday
night when Hopkins fell out of the ring during a clinch with
challenger  &UR; Robert Allen  &LR; and injured his left ankle ... After
giving up his face once again for the betterment of boxing,  &UR; Arturo
Gatti  &LR; was undaunted despite losing a split decision to  &UR; Ivan
Robinson &LR; . The fight left Gatti's features dented and torn once
again, but had fight fans hollering his name anew because of the
stirring way he took all Robinson threw at him and then battled
back to nearly stop Robinson in the late rounds. Robinson landed
nearly half of his 795 punches and between them, they threw an
amazing 1,630 blows. ``I was scared for him watching that fight,''
said HBO senior vice president for programming  &UR; Lou DiBella &LR; . Yet
within hours after his defeat, the Little Warrior came to DiBella
and said he wanted to go through with an Oct. 31 fight. That is not
going to happen, but he will fight again before the year is out ...
As for Robinson, there is now talk of his fighting IBF lightweight
champion  &UR; Shane Mosley &LR; , &UR;  &LR; World Boxing Organization title holder
 &UR; Angel Manfredy &LR; , &UR;  &LR; or Gatti again after putting on the fight of his
life ... Word is the Jan. 23  &UR; George Foreman &LR; - &UR; Larry Holmes  &LR; fight
of the aged will land at the Astrodome in Houston. Fight promoter
 &UR; Roger Leavitt  &LR; was in Houston last week, and Dome officials have
cleared the date, although no deal has been finalized, according to
sources ... When a former business associate of King's was asked
how it could be that despite a blind draw of federal judges to
determine what cases they get, King ended up with  &UR; Lawrence McKenna
 &LR; overseeing his insurance fraud case, the suit of  &UR; Mike Tyson
 &LR; against him, and the suit of  &UR; Felix Trinidad  &LR; against him, he
said, ``It's one of life's great mysteries, isn't it?' ... Agent of
the quarterbacks  &UR; Leigh Steinberg  &LR; is negotiating to join  &UR; Sugar
Ray Leonard's  &LR; new boxing management company and will have a final
meeting on the matter Monday in Los Angeles. Steinberg was involved
briefly in the marketing of De La Hoya and  &UR; Evander
Holyfield &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and an associate who once handled De La Hoya for
Steinberg,  &UR; Bjorn Rebney &LR; , &UR;  &LR; is now listed as CFO of SRL Management.
Leonard has already approached Mosley, who is managed by his
father, about representing him. ``The idea is to give these guys
some real professional representation,'' Steinberg said. ``I'm not
sure yet if we'll get involved but Ray has some good ideas and
we're exploring them.''
</P>

   The Tyson soap opera continued last week when his new trainer,
 &UR; Jesse Reid &LR; , &UR;  &LR; walked out after tiring of Tyson's friends and
associates coming into the gym in Las Vegas where they were working
and advising him. Reid says he has no hard feelings toward Tyson
and would return to work with him but not under the odd conditions
he faced last week. Reid told the New York Daily News that he found
the anger in Tyson and his lack of confidence disconcerting and
believes that has to change for him to return to glory in the ring.
``He's angry and confused with a mess of crazy people around him,''
Reid said. Reid also said Tyson later came to his hotel room and
apologized to him but Reid felt other matters had to be sorted out
before he could come back. He could be replaced by former Dedham
fighter  &UR; Freddie Roach  &LR; or one of his former trainers,  &UR; Richie
Giachetti  &LR; ... If Trinidad wins his suit and is free to fight for
HBO, he could land a bout with former champion  &UR; Pernell Whitaker
 &LR; after Whitaker takes a fall tuneup, now that Quartey is
unavailable ... The rise of  &UR; Bill Cayton  &LR; as an ESPN boxing
consultant reportedly is paying him $1 million a year for the next
12 years, in addition to the more than $40 million Cayton was paid
for his fight film library. No wonder they're listening to him ...
The  &UR; Prince Naseem Hamed &LR; - &UR; Kennedy McKinney  &LR; fight believed to be
set for Oct. 31 fell apart for the second time when Hamed's
promoter,  &UR; Frank Warren &LR; , &UR;  &LR; allegedly insisted that other fighters
promoted by  &UR; Murad Muhammad  &LR; be included in a three-fight package.
Warren wanted  &UR; Roy Jones Jr. &LR;  to fight former super middleweight
champion  &UR; Steve Collins  &LR; and Jones's friend and stablemate  &UR; Smoke
Gainer  &LR; to get in with featherweight  &UR; Angel Vazquez &LR; . When Muhammad
balked, Hamed agreed instead to fight former bantamweight champion
 &UR; Wayne McCullough &LR; , &UR;  &LR; giving him an unexpected $600,000 payday ...
Speaking of Warren, not long after severing his relationship with
King, he signed former King heavyweight  &UR; Frans Botha &LR; , &UR;  &LR; junior
lightweight  &UR; Marco Antonio Barrera &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and Vazquez to promotional
deals ... A recent study by the Segal Co. claimed that a
comprehensive retirement program for professional boxers is
feasible but pointed out, ``Congressional action or collective
bargaining will be necessary to bring that kind of program into
existence.'' ... Not that you should care about this quite yet, but
 &UR; Razor Ruddock  &LR; (31-5-1) won again a week ago, beating journeyman
 &UR; Rodolfo Marin  &LR; (21-5).

ON THE JOB TRAINING FOR ZENGA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ The Revolution have captured enough
followers to be ranked second in total attendance in the three
seasons of Major League Soccer. But if they were in Italy, they
would command a special kind of attention with Walter Zenga as head
coach.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga was among the most charismatic and opinionated of players
in Europe during a 20-year career, and there is curiosity about how
his personality will translate to coaching. The Revolution hope
that if Zenga can impose his will on a game from the sideline, he
could rekindle their playoff hopes.
</P>
<P>
   But Zenga has had little time to prepare for this role, and less
than 72 hours to work with the team in preparation for its meeting
with the Miami Fusion at 3 p.m. Sunday. The Fusion lead the
Revolution by 6 points for the final playoff place in the Eastern
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   As the home team, the Fusion would normally be obligated to
attack, but they need only a tie to maintain their standing. The
Revolution are hoping to escape the cellar, but have defeated only
four teams this season and need to regain their confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a defensive coach,'' Zenga said. ``For me, offensive
and defensive styles do not exist. You are more secure and you have
the fans behind you at home. But you simply have to play the game.
There are moments when you attack and moments when you defend.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this moment, if we lose this game, we are out. The players
know this. If we win or if we lose, we aren't going to make big
changes. The most important thing for us is to construct a
competent team. This always takes time, and it's not easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the logistics for this match have been prepared by
Zenga's assistant, Sid Mazzola.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a difficult situation for us,'' Mazzola said. ``Walter
has watched tapes of Miami and given some suggestions but he is
limited in what he can do right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a do-or-die situation. There is no way Walter can
impose his style of play on the team in two or three days. Walter
likes the attacking game, and he likes players who give their all
and play their roles. He wants the flanks covered from corner flag
to corner flag, and wants players to take responsibility and not
rely on others to do their job. But for now, we are mostly
concerned with the morale of the team and playing safely.''
</P>
<P>
   Mazzola, 50, has been involved in soccer in the Boston area
since arriving in 1963 from San Donato, a small village in
Frosinone province near Rome. He coached the Boston Bolts in the
American Professional Soccer League from 1988-90, and joined the
Revolution as a scout last year.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzola met Zenga when the Italian national team played at
Foxboro Stadium in June 1992 and became a confidant when Zenga was
playing for the Revolution last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players we worked with in the (APSL) were coming from the
same place as most of the players in the MLS,'' Mazzola said. ``The
budget is bigger in the MLS. But in both leagues, you have to be
resourceful. It's not like in Italy, where you have rich owners who
will spend millions on new players. Here, you can't buy solutions
to your problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Mazzola is accustomed to doing things the hard way. In the
pre-USA '94 World Cup days, the Bolts received little publicity and
performed on artificial turf at Nickerson Field before going out of
business. Mazzola then coached the state's top amateurs in national
competitions, under unglamorous conditions _ little preparation
time or continuity, small budgets, long-distance travel.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the players who constitute the MLS, Mazzola has
paid dues. He might have had an easier time in Italy, where the
name Mazzola is even more well-known than Zenga. Among Italy's most
legendary players were Valentino Mazzola, who died in the 1949
Superga air crash, and his son, Sandro.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't related,'' Mazzola said, ``but the name makes people
pay attention.''

THIS IS TRULY AMATEURS' HOUR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They unveiled a stamp the other day that honors the life, times,
and brilliant accomplishments of Bobby Jones. It's but a 32-cent
tribute to a man who never looked to make a nickel in prize money,
but the timing is ironic because amateur golf, of which Jones is
the patron saint, has never had a year of such rich success.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent case in point: Sergio Garcia, the 18-year-old
Spaniard whose talents have been on display all week in the US
Amateur at Oak Hill Country Club in Rochester, N.Y. Word of this
brilliant player had circulated in whispers for more than two
years, but when he stormed to an impressive victory in the British
Amateur this summer, the whispers gave way to loud, boastful talk.
</P>
<P>
   When he dispatched defending champion Matt Kuchar, 2 and 1,
Friday to move into the semifinals, Garcia took aim at history
(only four golfers, including Jones in his epic 1930 Grand Slam,
have won the British and US Amateurs in the same season) and added
a dramatic footnote to his summer of accomplishments. But his bid
was denied Saturday by Tom McKnight, who defeated Garcia, 3 and 1,
on his way to a berth in the final.
</P>
<P>
   There was Kuchar, seemingly the only golfer on the course having
fun, as he thrilled them in Augusta and made them sing in San
Francisco. He sat among the leaders at the Masters, then the US
Open, and galleries adopted the kid with the infectious smile.
</P>
<P>
   Kuchar was not alone for long as the darling of the golf world,
because Jenny Chuasiriporn and Justin Rose soon joined him. The
20-year-old Chuasiriporn lost in a playoff at the US Women's Open,
extra holes that were made necessary by her 40-foot birdie putt at
the 72d. Rose, 17, took a run at the British Open, a bid that came
up short, though not before he ended the wild ride by holing out
for birdie _ out of rough, over a bunker, to a pin cut tight _ on
the 18th hole of the final day.
</P>
<P>
   Now throw Garcia into the mix. He's as good as advertised.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's long _ very long,'' said Kevin Quinn of Charles River CC
in Newton, a participant in both the British and US Amateurs. ``At
the British Amateur I saw him knock it 15-20 yards over a par-4.''
That was his drive, folks. At 17 years old. In a pressure-packed
event.
</P>
<P>
   To warm up for the US Amateur, Garcia was granted a spot in an
American Junior Golf Association tournament at Apawamis CC in Rye,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't even play that well and still won (by three
shots),'' said Andover's Net Yetten. ``He was on a different level
than the rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Apawamis, said Yetten, isn't very long, but it's extremely
tight. Most of the juniors, he said, were hitting 2- and 3-irons
off the tees, maybe the occasional 3-wood, but not Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played in the group in front of him on the final day, and I
kept turning around to watch,'' said Yetten. ``He hit the driver
all day, long and dead straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Frozen ropes, they are called. You don't hit them unless you're
gifted. You don't attempt them on tight layouts unless you're
fearless. Garcia is both _ plus he's smart enough to seek out Seve
Ballesteros for help.
</P>
<P>
   Ballesteros understands what it is to be young and in possession
of world-class talent. At 19, he was a raw, unheralded professional
who nearly won the British Open. Three years later, in 1979, he won
the first of his three claret jugs, and by age 31 he had five major
championships.
</P>
<P>
   But Ballesteros was an exception, a youngster who met with
almost immediate success, even in the majors. Like Jack Nicklaus
years earlier. Like Tiger Woods years later.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, however, the game is cruel to youngsters who think they
right away can do week in and week out against the pros what they
did against the amateurs.
</P>
<P>
   Take Rose, for example. He has yet to make a cut in four events
as a professional, and while he's not about to pack it in, the game
has got to be 10 times harder today than it was last month for
those four marvelous days at Royal Birkdale.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Sherry could have told him. A Scottish phenom who was low
amateur at the 1995 British Open, Sherry helped Great
Britain/Ireland upset a Woods-led US team in the Walker Cup. He
turned pro, but if you look for his name these days, you have to
look on the Challenge Tour, Europe's answer to the Nike Tour.
</P>
<P>
   It's a hard enough game when you're an amateur; it's a brutal
business when you're a pro. Which is why Chuasiriporn was so
refreshing while chasing history in July.
</P>
<P>
   Did it make her want to forsake her senior year at Duke and turn
pro?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' she said. ``I love college. I'm having fun.''
</P>
<P>
   So is Garcia and so is Kuchar. But check in with them a year
from now, when both are likely to be professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Local golfers did not fare well in the US Amateur. The trio from
Charles River _ Quinn,  &UR; James Driscoll &LR; ,  &UR; Dean Burpee &LR;  _ was out
before match play, as were  &UR; Eric McPhail &LR;  of Sandy Burr,  &UR; Dave
Tasho &LR;  of Thorny Lea,  &UR; Doug Clapp &LR;  of Walpole,  &UR; Chris Tetler &LR;  of
Squirrel Run,  &UR; Marc Chandonnet &LR;  of Dracut, and  &UR; Bruce Carter &LR;  of
Worcester.
</P>
<P>
   For Quinn, it was particularly disappointing, for he had made it
to the second round of match play a year ago at Cog Hill outside
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the course, it's really fair,'' said Quinn of Oak Hill,
a  &UR; Donald Ross  &LR; design. ``But I putted terribly in the first round.
I was 6 over after six holes and had three-putted four times.''
</P>
<P>
   A 78 on the West Course left Quinn a huge task, given the fact
his second round was on the East Course, which has hosted a Ryder
Cup (1995) and US Open (1989) in recent years. He put forth a nice
effort, shooting 73, but his 151 was not good enough to get into
match play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just never got anything going,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't alone. Former champions  &UR; Mitch Voges &LR;  (1991) and  &UR; John
Harris &LR;  (1993) missed the cut, too, though Voges's failure was more
painful. He shared the first-round lead with a 68, only to balloon
to 78_146.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Trip Kuehne &LR;  and  &UR; Steve Scott &LR; , losers to Woods in the Amateur
finals of 1994 and '96, respectively, also left early.
</P>
<P>
   Driscoll's coach at the University of Virginia,  &UR; Mike Moraghan &LR; ,
was gone after stroke play; so, too,  &UR; Matt &LR;  (son of  &UR; D.A. &LR; )
 &UR; Weibring &LR; . It was a little better showing for the son of  &UR; Johnny
Miller &LR; , as  &UR; Andy &LR;  got to the third round of match play before
being ousted by  &UR; Bryce Molder &LR; , Kuchar's teammate at Georgia Tech.
His fatherly duties over, Johnny then got down to the business of
commentating, for he was working the event for NBC, too.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who owns two major championships and thus is not easily
impressed, was among the many onlookers staring in disbelief as
 &UR; Hank Kuehne &LR;  launched practice shot after practice shot into
orbit. The younger brother of Trip and  &UR; Kelli &LR; , Hank, who will meet
McKnight in Sunday's final, holds nothing back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hitting next to him at the practice area,'' said Quinn,
``and he was hitting them 40 yards over the net.''
</P>
<P>
   If you attended the US Junior Amateur at Wollaston Golf Club in
Milton back in 1992, you may remember seeing Hank Kuehne in that
tournament, though he's a different person these days. His teenage
years centered around drinking, and he has said that golf saved his
life. The Southern Methodist All-American is a recovering alcoholic
who has worked hard to polish his game, and he's likely to follow
Kelli's pro path rather than Trip's business career.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   While Hank Kuehne appears to have his battle with alcoholism in
check,  &UR; John Daly &LR;  continues to be reminded how tough the disease
really is. After a nice start to his 1998 season, Daly has been
struggling and in Thursday's second round of the Greater Vancouver
Open, he was in tears as he walked around the 15th green, arms
folded, the shakes setting in, just as they had at last year's US
Open. Unlike a year ago at Congressional, however, Daly was able to
get through this round. ``I knew more what to do this time than
there,'' Daly told reporters the next day. ``It's part of the
program. The first two years are very difficult in this program.
It's the hardest part. The shakes are going to come and go and some
are going to last longer than others.'' Daly has put on a lot of
weight, and some recent moves _ failing to sign his card at the
FedEx St. Jude Classic, insisting on hitting driver at tight
Sahalee in the PGA Championship _ have thrust him into the
spotlight for the wrong reasons. But he seems to have more
supporters on Tour than he might have thought. ``All the players on
the Tour have showed me so much respect and it means an awful
lot,'' said Daly after playing partners  &UR; Corey Pavin &LR;  and  &UR; David
Frost &LR;  came to his aid in Vancouver. It was 80 degrees and Daly had
on two coats when his partners comforted him in front of a large
gallery at the 15th green. Finally composed, Daly showed character
by making a birdie at 16, though he shot 74 for the round. He
followed with a 70_144 and was not around on the weekend for the
fourth straight event (three missed cuts, one DQ) ... On the other
side of the pond, there are problems of another sort for  &UR; Colin
Montgomerie &LR; . He was pleasantly surprised when he was not heckled
at the PGA Championship, but perhaps the folks felt sorry for him.
His play, after all, has not been very good. Friday, in the second
round of the BMW International in Munich, Montgomerie needed 35
putts in his round of 75 as he missed his second straight cut, the
first time he's done that since 1991. A great ball-striker who can
usually split a 10-yard fairway with a driver, Montgomerie had five
three-putts Friday, which is more like a season's total for him.
Going back to the British Open in July, Montgomerie has broken 70
just three times in 14 rounds. There's been a 79 and a 77, and in
his last five events, Montgomerie is 21 over par. Whereas practice
is the reason cited for  &UR; Vijay Singh's &LR;  recent tear, could it be
that Montgomerie has overdone the extra work? He usually needs a
map to find the range, but he was spotted there at the recent
European Open at the K Club in Ireland, even after he had missed
the cut, which produced a series of wisecracks from his colleagues.
No doubt Monty's woes, like his tee shots, will fade, but for now,
don't consider him a walking advertisement for  &UR; Dave Pelz &LR; , the
short-game guru with whom he's been working.
</P>

<P>
   The New England PGA Championship will visit a pair of unheralded
but demanding layouts _ Ledgemont and Agawam Hunt Club _ for its
78th edition.  &UR; Webb Heintzelman &LR;  is the defending champion, having
prevailed by three shots a year ago at the Woodlands Club and
Portland CC in Maine. The 54-hole event, with a $50,000 purse,
opens Tuesday at Ledgemont in Seekonk, then moves to Agawam
Wednesday. The field of 150 will be cut to the low 60 and ties for
Thursday's finale at Agawam, a course in East Providence that has
an intriguing history. Originally designed by  &UR; Willie Park &LR; , &UR;  &LR; it
was redesigned by Ross, then again by Cornish in the 1960s ...
While the New England pros are chasing that prize, some of the
finest juniors in the area will be at New Seabury in Mashpee for
the AJGA Tucker Anthony. Defending champion  &UR; Kenny Lewis  &LR; of Dennis
leads a strong boys' field, which includes, among others, Yetten,
 &UR; Michael Carbone &LR;  of Brewster,  &UR; Adam Carlucci &LR;  of Franklin,  &UR; Joey
Pohle &LR;  of Williamstown, and  &UR; Jeremiah Daly III &LR;  and  &UR; Nat Hoopes  &LR; of
Marion. The girls' field will feature the  &UR; Grzebien  &LR; sisters of
Saunderstown, R.I. _  &UR; Anna &LR; ,  &UR; Lauren &LR; , and  &UR; Mary Ellen &LR; , as well as
local standouts  &UR; Kelly Robb &LR;  of Concord,  &UR; Colleen McDonnell &LR;  of
Hingham,  &UR; Kristie Howard &LR;  of Newton, and  &UR; Lisa Morgan &LR;  of
Dartmouth.

CORONATION FOR CORONADO'S QUEST IN TRAVERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ The vagaries of fate kept Coronado's
Quest, perhaps the best of the 3-year-olds, from competing in the
Triple Crown, but the robust chestnut's time finally came Saturday
as he defeated Belmont Stakes winner Victory Gallop by a little
more than a nose in a classic stretch battle worthy of the prestige
accorded the $750,000 Travers Stakes at Saratoga. Raffies Majesty
was just another nose back following a rippling run to the wire.
</P>
<P>
   An emotional wreck in Florida all winter, Coronado's Quest was
aided by an operation to correct an entrapped epiglottis in
mid-March, and he has won five straight races since. He was kept
out of the Kentucky Derby because of his bad behavior prior to his
races at Gulfstream Park and missed the Preakness, in which he had
been listed as the morning line choice, and Belmont because of a
bruised foot. But the Mid-Summer Derby belonged to him, if only by
a nostril, in the time of 2:032/5 for the 1 1/4 miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``He acted great today,'' said jockey Mike Smith, who also won
the Travers with Holy Bull in 1994. ``He was unbelievable. This was
the best he's ever been. The fact he acted better today helped me
with that final eighth of a mile. I wanted to follow somebody. I
didn't want to be the one to move first. I moved when I wanted to
move. He was getting weary at the end. Victory Gallop is a tough
son of a gun. I just did whatever I could to get my horse home. I
was bouncing around and jumping up and down. I said to myself:
`Keep it going. Keep it going.' When our number went up, I felt the
weight of a truck was lifted off of my shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Shug McGaughey, who saddled his third Travers victor
(Easy Goer in 1989, Rhythm in 1990), indicated that the Super Derby
at Louisiana Downs Sept. 27 would be next for his charge. Victory
Gallop also may go to the Super Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Coronado's Quest, a son of 1988 Travers winner Forty Niner, was
nicely behaved in the paddock, paying all of his attention to the
leadout pony, unbothered by the throng of 48,545, the second
largest crowd in Saratoga history, surpassed only by the 50,359
that watched Alydar defeat Affirmed by disqualification in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Held as the second choice at 7-5 ($4.90 to win), Coronado's
Quest never turned a hair on the track and broke alertly from post
No. 3 under Smith, the leading rider at this meeting, while Victory
Gallop, the 6-5 favorite, and Alex Solis broke in from the far
outside No. 7, bumping Raffie's Majesty, an 11-1 shot under Jorge
Chavez, and squeezing back Deputy Diamond, who was all but
eliminated from the race and finished sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Longshot Dice Dancer set the pace with Grand Slam, a top
2-year-old but long off his game, following along. However,
Coronado's Quest was breathing hot on the leaders and he took over
with a flourish turning for home. The chase was on from there, with
Coronado's Quest hugging the rail and driving to the eighth-pole 1
1/2 lengths in front. But Victory Gallop, who always tries his
heart out and was second to Real Quiet (out for the year with
injured stifles) in both the Preakness and Belmont and to
Coronado's Quest in the Haskell, kept coming and Raffies Majesty
was flying late on the outside. But they were both too late.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The total handle for the nine-race card was 24,371,930, a
Saratoga rec-ord ... Favorite Trick, the 1997 Horse of the Year,
had an eventful trip and could do no better than fifth in the
$200,000 King's Bishop, a 7-furlong sprint for 3-year-olds, which
was won by 10-shot ($22 to win) Secret Firm.

GORDON SHOULD MAKE HEALTHY RUN OF IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ Two weeks ago, in the Pepsi 400 at Michigan
International Speedway, Jeff Gordon appeared to be making the 1998
Winston Cup championship a runaway as he won his fourth event in a
row.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, suffering from what appeared to be an upper
respiratory infection, Gordon barely survived the Goody's Headache
Powder 500 in Bristol, Tenn. He staggered to a fifth-place finish
in the marathon, which was won by Mark Martin to foil Gordon's bid
for five in a row and shave 30 points off his 97-point lead in the
Winston Cup standings.
</P>
<P>
   After that hiccup, Gordon comes to New Hampshire International
Speedway for Sunday's Farm Aid on CMT 300 with a clean bill of
health, suffering from nothing more than a slight cough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came down with something last Wednesday or Thursday before
Bristol,'' said Gordon. ``The worst racetrack you can possibly be
sick at is Bristol. It wears you out even when you're real healthy.
It ate me up pretty good, but I talked to a doctor this week and
got some medication. I still got a little bit of a cough, but by
Sunday I should be 99 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   That much was evident during Friday's pole qualifications when
Gordon won his first career pole position at NHIS, and seventh of
the season. Gordon tiptoed around the slippery mile oval in his No.
24 Dupont Chevrolet Monte Carlo to record a fast lap of 129.033
miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   It was a faster lap than any Gordon had run in practice. But
after watching four drivers tag the wall _ Dale Earnhardt, Jeff
Burton, and Ernie Irvan had to qualify backup cars _ Gordon decided
to take the cautious route around a track whose four corners had
been treated with ``asphalt conditioner'' in an attempt to widen
the racing groove.
</P>
<P>
   But, with Busch North Series cars and Featherlite Modified Tour
cars all laying down their own separate rubber compounds in the
groove, it only seemed to exacerbate the track's slippery
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very seldom do you ever run faster qualifying here at New
Hampshire than you do in practice,'' Gordon said. ``You run one or
two laps in practice and the track conditions seem to be trickier
here on a one-lap qualifying run than they do in practice. Most of
the time you see the cars slow down, which a lot of guys did. For
some reason, we were able to get a lot out of our car and get a
good, smooth lap and go faster than we did in practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess when you see cars hitting walls left and right, it
makes you ease off the gas a little bit and be more conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gordon knows that's not likely to be anyone's strategy
Sunday, especially not Martin, who has put the heat on Gordon as
much as anyone else this season with his impressive streak of 38
consecutive Top 10 finishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a great race car here,'' said Martin, who qualified
fifth-fastest (128.079) in his No. 6 Valvoline Ford Taurus. ``The
best car I've had here in a while. Last time up here we had a great
race car and we learned some things from Jeff Burton (the repeat
winner of the Jiffy Lube 300 July 11) and had a great run
(finishing runner-up to Burton).
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have a great qualifying position last time, we've
improved on that. Our starting position is better and our car is
working better so we're anxious to get into this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Labonte, driver of the No. 18 Interstate Batteries
Pontiac, will start second in the grid while Kenny Schrader, holder
of the track's qualifying record (129.182), will start third.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always nice to start up front,'' said Gordon, the
defending champion in the CMT 300. ``There's two places you can go,
either stay in front or go backwards. Sometimes it can be a little
trickier and tougher on you being on the pole, but we get to pick a
good spot on pit road to pit from. If the outside (groove) doesn't
come in as early as we'd like, it's definitely an advantage to
start up front, especially on the inside because it could be tough
to pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``As that groove gets wider, as the modifieds and all these guys
run more races, and as the race goes on, I don't think it's going
to matter a whole lot where you start, but we're certainly glad to
be starting up front and get a little momentum going. We pretty
much got our tails kicked the last time we were here and last
weekend in Bristol. We want to come in here ready to go.''

LAVER TAKES ON REHAB WITH CUSTOMARY ZEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE _ There's no shortage of tapes of redheaded Rodney
``Rocket'' Laver in his racket-flapping prime, swooping to conquer
like an avenging firebird. He flies yet on the neural tape decks of
all those who savored his Boston performances, making Longwood
Cricket Club his private fiefdom.
</P>
<P>
   But now there's another tape of a near-defeat that he does not
care to see, even though Rod can be objective enough to recognize
its value. Not to sports _ but to mankind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctors tell me it's unique,'' he says, ``and it can help
(us) understand what I and a lot of others have gone through. And
will go through.''
</P>
<P>
   Laver's voice is coming through the phone from his home in the
Palm Springs area. There _ ``home, free from the hospital at last''
_ he's recuperating from the stroke that almost gave him a big L
July 27.
</P>
<P>
   His voice is unmistakable. Soft, considerate, tinged with the
inflections of a Queensland farm boy who got off his horse to leave
Australia and whip the world with a tennis racket. But it is
hesitant, at times uncertain. Aphasic is the word.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll get over this. Sometimes my speech blurs, and I have to
think before I start talking. I'm working on it. It can be very
frustrating, the speech. Movement, too. I'm learning a lot of
simple things all over again, like a kid. Like,'' he chuckles,
``telling time.''
</P>
<P>
   The tape he talks about is a rarity, one on which Laver is the
victim. He had begun an on-camera interview with an ESPN reporter
in a Los Angeles hotel when the stroke struck.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fingers got numb, that's what I remember,'' he says. ``I
didn't have control. I know a lot of crazy things happened to me''
_ including explosive vomiting and collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to the doctors, this is the only tape of somebody
actually having a stroke. They say it's very valuable to study.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad if it can help people, but,'' he laughs, ``I'd just
as soon see a tape of me hitting a backhand down the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Those massive topspinning backhands, flying from a Godzillan
left arm (remarkably attached to an unremarkable-looking 5-foot-8-
1/2-inch body) terrorized what is now the MFS Pro Championships for
12 years. Laver beat eight-time champ Pancho Gonzalez on grass _
during a northeaster deluge, no less! _ to win at Longwood in 1964
when the US Pro moved from New York to The Bean.
</P>
<P>
   That was his first of seven successive Longwood finals, with
four more titles to come: 1966 over Ken Rosewall, 1967 over Andres
Gimeno, 1968-69 over John Newcombe. Tony Roche seized the title
from him in 1970, snapping a Laverian streak of 23 matches, but Rod
was 31-4 in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The gang at the MFS Pro and their ATP colleagues should say an
extra prayer for Rod Laver nightly. He, Rosewall, Gonzalez, Lew
Hoad, plus a few others kept pro tennis breathing long enough for
the present bonanza to take shape.
</P>
<P>
   Especially Laver. He was the resurrector at a time the pros were
dead, 1962. That year he charged through the Australian, French,
Wimbledon, and the US Championships to sculpt the first of his two
Grand Slams. But as an amateur when those events barred the pros.
</P>
<P>
   Pro tennis needed him and his Grand Slam luster to keep going.
Rosewall and Hoad felt so needy that they put up their own money _
a two-year $125,000 guarantee, a fortune then _ to coax Laver onto
their side so that a new tour could be formed. He led them into the
promised land of open tennis and substantial prize money in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Next came his second Grand Slam in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to do it once more when the game was open and
everybody had a shot at me, not like '62,'' he would say.
</P>
<P>
   As we talk on the phone Friday, I in the Longwood press box,
Laver can hear the customers whooping it up while one of his
championship successors, Sjeng Schalken, is being dethroned by Paul
Haarhuis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope to come back one day,'' Rod says. ``That tournament
meant a lot to us, keeping the pro game going until the opens.''
</P>
<P>
   Laver says he's lying on his back in the living room, working at
rehab exercises. We've talked enough for now. His wife, Mary Laver,
takes over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a rough two weeks when he was in ICU,'' Mary says. ``We
(wife, daughter, son, and daughter-in-law) were in there with him,
at least one of us round-the-clock, to let him know we were there,
to calm him ... when he was conscious. It wasn't a great place for
his birthday (the 60th, Aug. 9).
</P>
<P>
   ``There were seizures, awfully high blood pressure. A fever they
had trouble controlling _ 106 degrees for a few days _ swelling of
the brain. He had to be restrained at times. He wanted out.
Sometimes he ripped out the IVs. Rough for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' her voice subsides, ``the lucky thing was the hotel
where it happened was only two blocks from the medical center. And
the neurosurgical team were all there. Within 15 minutes they were
working on him. We're so thankful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' she laughs, ``the therapists say they've never seen
anybody recovering from a stroke go at rehab so eagerly. But that's
Rod. The prognosis for full recovery is very good.''
</P>
<P>
   You would expect this from my candidate for the greatest of all
tennis players. For the Slam years, the Rocket won 19 of 34
tournaments in 1962, 17 of 32 in 1969 (played doubles, too). Pete
Sampras felt overworked last year, engaging in 18 singles
tournaments and winning seven.
</P>
<P>
   Laver intends ``to be back where I was, playing some tennis,
some golf, gardening, getting around for my endorsement
commitments.''
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't bet against it. He's moving about the neighborhood
currently with help, on a walker. Nevertheless, I'd be careful
about challenging him to a game, even if he's clinging with his
right hand to the walker.

AT 80, TED STILL SPLENDID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HERNANDO, Fla. _ Ted Williams is 80 years old Sunday. Can he
still be The Kid?
</P>
<P>
   The day will start like most of his days. Ted will probably rise
around 7 a.m., brush his teeth, call for his dog, Slugger, and sit
down to a hearty breakfast in his gigantic kitchen. He'll make
phone calls, then perhaps lie in bed with Slugger, watch television
news and, naturally, a ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   Later Sunday, there will be a birthday celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to have a wonderful seafood dinner sent up from the
Cape,'' Ted said in a lengthy interview at his home late last week.
``There won't be a lot of people. I've got my son here, my
daughter. It'll be something I love.''
</P>
<P>
   He is without question the largest figure in the history of New
England sports. But he is so much more than Teddy Ballgame. He
served his country in two wars and for the last half-century has
been a tireless foot soldier in the fight against children's
cancer. Ted Williams is the Jimmy Fund. And now he's a tunnel, too.
</P>
<P>
   Life's been tough on The Kid in the last decade. He has suffered
two strokes and undergone hip replacement. His vision, once the
best in the business (it was said he could read the print on a 78
r.p.m. record while it was spinning on the turntable), is narrow.
He uses a walker and a cane to get around his vast Citrus Hills
home, and a staff of three works to keep him comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I'm getting along pretty good,'' he said. ``I can't run.
I can't fish and I don't see that good. I can't drive. But I have
wonderful help around me. And thank God there's a television. That
is one thing that any person that can't do a lot of things can be
thankful for.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tough part as you get older, son of a bitch, you lose a
friend. Some guy gets hit by a car, and some guy is dying that
you've known for 40-50 years. That's the sad part. But I've got to
say this. The compensating factor for me is that I have really
wonderful friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted can see what's in front of him, but not well enough to read.
Put a bat in his hands and he can still tell you the exact weight
and length. He does his best talking in the earlier part of the
day, then wears down as the day grows long.
</P>
<P>
   Though his eyes and legs have faltered, Ted still sounds like a
man with a megaphone.
</P>
<P>
   Get him going on the 1998 Red Sox. Stand back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every game I can see, I watch, particularly if the Red Sox are
on TV,'' he said. ``I get to see all the good players, and there
are a ton of them _ a ton of them. Big strong guys with good, quick
styles. Everything. Geez. I didn't think I'd ever see this many big
strong guys and I look at them every day and I see more guys that
can really swing the bat now than I've seen in a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the Red Sox and I'll tell you why I like them. I was
thinking of this last night. I think Jimy Williams has done one
tremendous job. He's got 'em playing like hell, he's got everybody
happy on the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'll tell you another guy that isn't even close to getting
the credit. I said it the day after he came. Dan Duquette. He's the
secret weapon of it all. This guy is more responsible for the
success the Red Sox are having. I haven't even heard of some of
these guys he's brought in and then I see, goddamn, he's a pretty
good little player. And then there's another guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more new faces, more new names, more nationalities,
more everything on that club than there has ever been on a Red Sox
team. And in a short series with the pitching they got, anything
can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted on Nomar Garciaparra: ``A lot of people were onto him early
on. I didn't want to say how good I thought Garciaparra was gonna
be because I didn't want to jinx him, but he is truly a great
player.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted on Mo Vaughn: ``That guy playing first base, I didn't
particularly like him. I knew he was big and strong. But the more I
saw him, I saw he was more aggressive. He was a tiger at the plate,
but I didn't think that swing was all that good. It was big and
erratic. But I want to tell you, that guy has learned how to hit
and he's a terrific force on that ballclub right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The quest to top Roger Maris's 61-homer season of 1961 has
dominated the national baseball news this summer. Typically,
Williams is generous on the topic. Unlike Bob Feller and many of
his peers, Ted does not live in the past or resent today's players.
And Mark McGwire has a place in Ted's Museum and Hitters' Hall of
Fame in Hernando.
</P>
<P>
   ``McGwire could do it,'' said Ted. ``He's a powerful guy. He can
hit a ball a ton. I want any of these guys to do it. I think it's
terrific. They're playing in an era when the parks have gotten more
reasonable. In the real old parks, you could hit the ball. Then
they got to building parks that Jesus Christ couldn't hit one out.
Now it's going the other way, and the livelier ball, and look at
the enthusiasm. Baseball's really on a surge, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   He's still in business
</P>
<P>
   While he roars from his kitchen table, staffers bring him
muffins and a toothpick. John Sullivan and Jack Gard are Ted's
personal aides and Robert Hogerheide is the resident chef. Last
week, Ted instructed Hogerheide on the finer points of eggplant
preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have wonderful, wonderful help,'' said Ted. ``And if they
don't please me that much, I have to get rid of them, 'cause I
don't have much time to do what I want to do and damn it all, I'd
like to have it kind of good while I'm around.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted's house is the centerpiece of the Citrus Hills community and
stands little more than a McGwire tape-measure shot from his
museum, which is run by Arthur ``Buzz'' Haman and an army of
volunteers, including Lee Serra. The museum has grown considerably
since its dedication in 1994 and today has enough memorabilia to
make Coopers-town jealous. You can see Ted's high school yearbook,
letters he wrote during his rookie season, and bats from all the
500-home run hitters. ``The Today Show's'' Joe Garagiola taped a
segment with Ted in the museum last Monday and Senator John McCain
of Arizona was a visitor Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hearts are in that museum,'' said Ted. ``We have
volunteers that work in that museum that love baseball and they're
proud to be there. I get all kinds of people that come up to me and
say the museum was wonderful and they enjoy it as much as any place
they've ever been, regarding baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Between the museum and Ted's house (rumored to be situated on
the second-highest piece of land in the state of Florida), Ted's
son, John Henry, runs the business of Ted Williams, which includes
Ted Williams Family Enterprises (Ted's commercial ventures,
www.hitter.com) and Hitter Communications (an internet service
provider, www.hitter.net).
</P>
<P>
   Ted doesn't know very much about the technical aspects of the
operation, only enough to say, ``John Henry's working hard and he
has a damn good modern, advanced internet. It's a great hope for
his business. What he wants in this business is service. He's got a
good setup.''
</P>
<P>
   Shoeless Joe and WWII
</P>
<P>
   While John Henry takes care of business, Ted maintains his own
causes. The 80-year-old slugger is campaigning to get Shoeless Joe
Jackson into the Hall of Fame. Jackson was banned from baseball
after he took money to throw the 1919 World Series, but Ted
believes there's been enough time and new evidence to give Jackson
another chance.
</P>
<P>
   Another story. Stand back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, the guy that signed me to play for the Red Sox was Eddie
Collins, and he played with Joe Jackson,'' Ted said. ``And I have
thought about Joe Jackson. Collins used to reminisce about Babe
Ruth, (Lou) Gehrig, and Buck Weaver and all the great pitchers and
hitters they had, and one day I asked him about Joe Jackson. He was
pretty reverent about it. He dropped his head and said what a
player he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have thought about that for years. Jackson was barred from
baseball when he was 25-26 maybe, and he died at 76 and he was
under suspension from baseball under a very, very arguable
situation. He was never convicted in court. Nobody that ever saw
him didn't think he was just as good as there ever was. (Ty) Cobb
said he was the greatest natural hitter. I tried to copy him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never met him. I used to go by his house in South Carolina.
In those days, 1938, Joe Jackson was always thought of in the
negative.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a great image. A 20-year-old Ted Williams passing by the
home of Shoeless Joe Jackson. Loosely interpreted, it's the
baseball version of a young Bruce Springsteen hanging outside the
gate at Graceland, wondering if Elvis was home.
</P>
<P>
   World War II has become trendy since the release of Steven
Spielberg's ``Saving Private Ryan.'' Ted was a Marine pilot in
World War II and the Korean Conflict. John Glenn said Williams was
the best pilot he flew with. Alas, Ted doesn't go to the movies
(``They say it's pretty good, but it's gooey and gory and I don't
want to see that'').
</P>
<P>
   The best hitter and the best pilot was also the best fisherman,
and it is the fishing flashbacks that hit closest to his heart. He
hasn't been able to fish in five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wade anymore, 'cause I'm not that steady,'' he said,
``but boy, I sit home on Saturdays and watch TV and I see these
guys going to New Zealand and South America and way the hell up in
the Arctic Circle. And they're catching big steelhead, and rainbow
trout. Chinook salmon. Beautiful places. And I always say, `Gee, I
was lucky. I was there, too.' I had the chance to go to a ton of
places to fish, and oh, God, I loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   He sounds wistful talking about fishing. It's the same when he
talks about Slugger. And about turning 80.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never think you're going to make it to 80. Do you?''
</P>
<P>
   He holds little sentiment for Fenway Park, but said he'd like to
be consulted about specifics when the Red Sox get around to
designing their new ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Does he think he'll ever see the Red Sox win a World Series?
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we did it in '75 when we won that sixth game,'' he
said. ``I thought we were going to do it that year and it didn't
happen. But the Boston fans have been loyal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I don't want to live to be a hell of a lot older
than I am, but I want to tell you something. I would like to look
in the stars some night and say, `Goddamn it, we did it.'''

CORONADO'S QUEST WINS THE TRAVERS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ In a furious three-horse finish,
Coronado's Quest raced to the head of the class of 3-year-old colts
Saturday when he won the 129th Travers Stakes by a nose over
Victory Gallop, who in turn had a nose on Raffie's Majesty.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fifth straight victory for Coronado's Quest since he
closed a losing Florida campaign and skipped the Triple Crown
series because of his violent behavior before races. Since then he
has behaved with style and grace while winning five straight
stakes. And he passed a milestone Saturday before 48,545 spectators
at Saratoga by winning ``the summertime Kentucky Derby,'' 10 years
after it was won by his celebrated sire, Forty Niner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still learning about him,'' said Shug McGaughey, who
trains the colt for Stuart Janney III. ``The horse is learning,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   In the larger race for the 3-year-old championship, Coronado's
Quest seized the momentum from Real Quiet, who has been sidelined
with a foot injury after winning the Kentucky Derby and Preakness,
and from Favorite Trick, last year's juvenile champion and Horse of
the Year, who ran fifth Saturday in a race on the Travers
undercard. But more significant, he made it two straight over
Victory Gallop, the winner of the Belmont Stakes, who had also run
second to Coronado's Quest in the Haskell three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like a million pounds has been lifted off my back,''
said Mike Smith, who has been the rider on Coronado's Quest in good
times and bad. ``I'm glad the race was written for a mile and a
quarter and not a mile and a quarter and a jump.''
</P>
<P>
   Alex Solis, who replaced the injured Gary Stevens as the jockey
on Victory Gallop this past week, blamed the slow early pace for
the fact that Coronado's Quest still had the energy to finish big.
``He fought us all the way down the stretch,'' Solis said, ``and
proved how good a horse he is.''
</P>
<P>
   And the New York-bred Raffie's Majesty, who flew into the photo
finish with a rush in the final strides, got this tribute from his
jockey, Jorge Chavez. ``I thought I was going to win,'' Chavez
said. ``One more jump, and we could have won.''
</P>
<P>
   The drama in the stretch developed after Dice Dancer had set
slow fractions while running the first three-quarters of a mile in
1:13 with Grand Slam and Coronado's Quest shadowing him. Then,
after one mile, Coronado's Quest collared him as they turned for
home. Grand Slam gave way to Victory Gallop, a great closer who
finished second in the Derby and Preakness. And Coronado's Quest
and Victory Gallop dueled each other in the final fierce yards,
while Raffie's Majesty shot into the picture on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   Coronado's Quest ran the mile and a quarter in 2:03 2/5, paid
$4.90 for a $2 bet to win and added $450,000 to a bankroll that has
already reached $1.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the King's Bishop, two races before the Travers, the Horse of
the Year became the disappointment of the year: Favorite Trick lost
for the third time in six starts this year. In fact, he finished
fifth in a field of seven after getting trapped in traffic along
the rail in the homestretch.
</P>
<P>
   The winner, Secret Firm, who has been running chiefly in
Maryland, was a surprise but not a fluke. He went off at 10-1, but
then won his sixth straight race for his trainer, Graham Motion.
</P>
<P>
   Secret Firm took this one by three-quarters of a length over
Mint, who had the same margin on Scatmandu. He ran the seven
furlongs under Edgar Prado in 1:22 3/5, returned $22 and earned
$120,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Mott, the trainer of Favorite Trick, said the short
distance might have cost his colt ``his early lick,'' and added,
``It looked like he started to make a good run, there was a time
when a hole opened, but someone else was quicker, and he had
nowhere to go.''

<P>
   Yankees center fielder Bernie Williams, hitting .340, is the
favorite to win the AL batting title, which certainly won't hurt
his value when he becomes a free agent after the season. Owner
George Steinbrenner won't discuss a possible deal with Williams,
who missed time early in the season because of injury. ``I know
that he is a little more rested because of all the time he had
off,'' said Steinbrenner, sounding as is he's questioning his
star's durability.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: One of the worst free-agent acquisitions belongs to
Tampa. The Devil Rays signed Wilson Alvarez, who is 0-5 with a 6.16
ERA in his last five starts. ... Boston's Tim Wakefield pitched a
complete-game victory over the Royals last week and didn't strike
out a batter. ... Toronto's Jose Cruz Jr., who was sent to the
minors earlier this year, had a strong month that included a
17-game hitting streak. ``Basically, I feel more in tune with
myself and my mechanics,'' Cruz said. ``I made the adjustments I
had to make, and now I know how I'm supposed to feel.'' ... In
their last 10 series, the Devil Rays have lost seven and split
three. ... The Orioles continue to fall off the wild-card pace.
Baltimore is 10 games behind Boston. ``It's going to have to be a
big collapse by Boston to do anything,'' catcher Chris Hoiles said.
Given Boston's history of terrible Septembers, it might be too
early to give it to the Bosox.

   Help could be on the way for the struggling Tigers. Outfield
prospect Gabe Kapler, playing for the Jacksonville Suns, has broken
the Southern League record for RBIs in a season with 134. With 12
games left, Kapler is trying to become the first minor-leaguer to
hit the 150-RBI mark since 1962. The old Southern League RBI record
of 132 was held by Terry Steinbach, who did it for Huntsville
(Oakland) in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Twins starter Bob Tewksbury has passed through waivers,
and the Angels, Giants and Mets are interested in picking him up
before Monday's postseason deadline. The Braves also had a scout
watching him. ... Indians outfielder Manny Ramirez has seven homers
and 21 RBIs against the Mariners this season. ... Indians first
baseman Jim Thome, out with a broken hand, has begun workouts
again, but it will be at least another 10 days before he can hit
again. Thome's replacement, rookie Richie Sexson, is hitting .375
with two homers and 11 RBIs in 25 games. ... New York lawyer Miles
Prentice has been picked by the Royals' board of directors to buy
the club, but only if 50 percent of the money comes from Kansas
City investors. ... Twins starter Brad Radke, who won 20 games last
year, is 1-7 since the break.
</P>
<P>
   West
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers go into the weekend three games behind the Angels,
but their schedule is favorable in the final month. Only seven of
the Rangers' remaining games are against teams with winning
records. They have two against the Orioles and five against
Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: At 6-4, the Angels are the only team that has a winning
record against the Yankees this season. ... The Angels saved more
than $4 million this season because right-hander Jack McDowell has
spent most of the season on the DL. McDowell signed a base contract
for $1 million with $5 million in incentives. ``The owners of the
ballclub and I _ and definitely Jack _ much prefer he earned every
penny there was,'' general manager Bill Bavasi said. ``The contract
makes it obvious that Jack getting hurt didn't surprise us.'' ...
Oakland starter Kenny Rogers has 53 assists, the most for a pitcher
since Baltimore's Jeff Ballard had 55 in 1989. ``There's nothing
better than making a great fielding play,'' Rogers said. ``I think
(hitters) think I'm sick.''

 &HT;    Risking an asterik: Androstenedione controversy may follow
McGwire
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Roger Maris broke Babe Ruth's single-season home-run record
in 1961, baseball placed a symbolic asterisk next to his name in
the record book. It from then-commissioner Ford Frick, who pointed
out that Maris had broken the record in a 162-game season and Ruth
had set his in 154 games.
</P>
<P>
   Fay Vincent later removed the asterisk after becoming
commissioner in 1989. Another asterisk could arise, at least in the
minds of baseball fans, if Mark Mc-Gwire passes Maris in the next
month.
</P>
<P>
   The question that troubles baseball: Will McGwire break the
record because of the testosterone-producing pills he is taking?
</P>
<P>
   It has become a huge controversy in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Major league baseball and the union have asked doctors to
research players' use of muscle-enhancing supplements, including
androstenedione, the one that McGwire is using. General Nutrition
Centers reportedly ordered its 3,700 stores to stop selling
androstenedione in June, two months before the McGwire story.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the over-the-counter drug is that no one is
sure exactly what side effects it has. The pill is unregulated
because the Food and Drug Administration no longer studies sports
supplements. But the NCAA, the NFL and the Olympics all have banned
``andro.''
</P>
<P>
   Opinions vary on how much of an advantage androstenedione gives
athletes. It increases the testosterone level and reportedly
provides the ``quick burst'' that would increase bat speed.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction from sports columnists has varied.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want Mark McGwire to hit 62 homers, damn it, and we don't
care if he does it with a hookah strapped to his back,'' wrote Ray
Ratto of the San Francisco Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Ratto might be right.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the early 1960s, June Cleaver isn't the prototype for
Mom, and Tang and Twip aren't the drinks of choice. Everyone wants
to see home runs, and it's not like this is the first time an
athlete has used something to enhance his play.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire isn't having a year like Brady Anderson did, going from
16 homers one year to 50 the next. McGwire hit 49 homers as a
rookie in 1987, and this season is his third in a row with more
than 50.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, in a baseball season that has been dominated
by the home-run chase, it's a shame that McGwire feels the need to
take the pills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's strong enough already,'' Little Leaguer R.J.
Johansen of Toms River (N.J.) said, ``so I don't think he should be
getting any extra help.''
</P>
<P>
   So get the asterisk ready.

   The Mets have been complaining so much about the funny bounces
on their infield at Shea Stadium that the club's groundskeepers
were sent away. Sent to Milwaukee, that is, to check out the
infield at County Stadium. Mets players say the County Stadium
infield is the best in baseball. So groundskeepers at Shea added a
new calcium clay mix to the Shea infield and water the dirt three
times a day instead of one. ``We want our infielders happy,''
pitcher Al Leiter said.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Marlins owner Wayne Huizenga recently bought a summer
home in Nantucket. The price tag was $7.5 million, which is less
than his team's current payroll. ... Since the All-Star break,
Montreal's Vladimir Guerrero has 53 RBIs, the most in the majors.
... The Expos recently scored just 12 runs in a seven-game losing
streak. ... When Andres Galarraga was hit by Darren Dreifort last
Saturday and charged the mound, Braves manager Bobby Cox
immediately began warming up Russ Springer in the bullpen. If
Driefort had stayed in the game, Cox was going to move Denny Neagle
to left field, bring in Springer to hit Dreifort and put Neagle
back on the mound. But the plan was scrapped when Driefort could
not continue.

   Astros manager Larry Dierker was glad Randy Johnson's turn in
the rotation didn't come in the two-game series against the Braves
in Houston. ``If we can show we can beat them without using
(Johnson), that's a big confidence boost,'' Dierker said. The
Astros split the two games. ``In a lot of people's minds we're
still No. 3 (behind the Braves and Padres), and that's as it should
be,'' first baseball Jeff Bagwell said. ``We haven't earned it
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Cardinals manager Tony La Russa was disappointed after
his team blew a 6-0 ninth-inning lead to the Marlins and lost 7-6
Wednesday: ``I'd have bet anything except my children that we'd
have walked away a winner,'' he said. ... When Cincinnati's Aaron
Boone hit his first major-league homer Wednesday, he became the
fourth member of his family to do so, following his grandfather,
Ray, his father, Bob, and his brother and current teammate, Bret.
... Cardinals first baseman Mark McGwire on Pittsburgh catcher
Jason Kendall: ``He's a stud. I love the way he plays the game.''

   When Barry Bonds hit his 400th home run to become the first
major-leaguer with 400 homers and 400 stolen bases, teammate Orel
Hershiser bought the ball from a fan for $5,000. Hershiser gave the
souvenir to Bonds and refused Bonds' attempt to repay him. So Bonds
gave Hershiser's son, Jordan, the batting gloves he wore on the
at-bat. Meanwhile, the cleats he wore will go to the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: The Padres are the only team without a four-game losing
streak this year. ... The reason the Padres brought up third
baseman George Arias from Class AA Las Vegas was to give starter
Ken Caminiti some time off. Nagging injuries continue to bother the
fragile Caminiti. ... San Francisco's Jose Mesa appears to be
making a comeback after a miserable start with the Giants. He
hasn't been scored on in his last five appearances and has allowed
only one run over five innings. ... Arizona third baseman Matt
Williams recently was ejected for the first time in his career. ...
The Dodgers hope to have a new general manager hired by next week.
... Since Los Angeles acquired him from Montreal, Carlos Perez is
0-3 in five starts. ... While Chicago's Kerry Wood probably will
win rookie-of-the-year honors, expect Colorado's Todd Helton (.318,
21 HRs, 85 RBIs) to finish second.

 &HT;    Falcons roster reduced to 56
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Falcons terminated the contracts of cornerback Lenny McGill
and wide receiver Keith Crawford Saturday, and placed running back
Byron Hanspard and offensive tackle Nate Miller on injured reserve,
cutting their active roster to 56.
</P>
<P>
   Hanspard underwent surgery Saturday afternoon to repair a torn
anterior cruciate ligament and a torn patellar tendon in his left
knee, injuries suffered in Friday's 17-0 win over Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons must cut three players by 4 p.m. today to reach the
NFL's active roster limit of 53. Neither coach Dan Reeves nor
general manager Harold Richardson would say who the candidates are
to be cut.
</P>
<P>
   There are nine defensive linemen left, and it's unlikely Atlanta
will keep more than eight. Undrafted rookie Ben Huff of Michigan
has been playing very little at end. He may end up on the practice
squad.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are 10 offensive linemen left and Reeves said the
team probably will keep 10, a lineman may be let go, and another
acquired either by trade or after being cut elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Right tackle Corey Louchiey, signed to a two-year, $3.5 million
contract, missed the first two preseason games with a groin injury,
and was uneven in a game against Pittsburgh. He was replaced on the
third possession Friday by rookie Ephraim Salaam. Also, reserve
Adam Schreiber's deep-snapping duties were handled Friday by Dave
Widell.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the Falcons have eight linebackers, and are likely to
keep seven. Middle linebackers Eddie Sutter, Ruffin Hamilton and
outside man Ben Talley all have limited upside.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons still have six cornerbacks and five safeties, and
may keep just 10 defensive backs.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Randy Fuller missed the first three preseason games
with an ankle injury. He played well Friday, though. The Falcons'
decision is made tougher because sixth-round pick Elijah Williams
has improved so fast.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, safeties Chris Bayne and rookie Omar Brown haven't
stood out, but an injury to backup Devin Bush may work to their
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   If a player is acquired from another team, another Falcon would
have to be cut. Reeves said 44-year-old quarterback Steve DeBerg is
almost certain not to be cut.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, a member of the practice squad most of the 1995 and '96
seasons who played sparingly in 11 games last year, suffered a
shoulder ``stinger'' in the second preseason game at Detroit. He
tried to practice the past week, but grabbed the shoulder several
times.
</P>
<P>
   McGill, 27, played for the Falcons the last two years. He was
cut just before the season last year, but re-signed after one game
as a nickel back and special teams man.
</P>
<P>
   ``In both cases we have somebody we think can be better,''
Reeves said. ``I've never seen a young man improve as much as Lenny
has. Those are the ones that kill you as a coach, make you want to
cry. I'd go to war with both those guys any day, any time.''

 &HT;    QB carousel set to crank up
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The regular season is only a week away, but several teams,
perhaps including the Atlanta Falcons, could be playing musical
chairs with the backup quarterback position. Before 4 p.m. today,
Rick Mirer will be cut by the Chicago Bears, and Jeff Blake almost
certainly will exit the Cincinnati Bengals.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then,'' said agent Marvin Demoff, who carefully
orchestrated Mirer's departure, ``is when the real craziness begins
... because there could be a real domino effect based on where
those two end up.''
</P>
<P>
   Demoff, who has been close to Denver coach Mike Shanahan and
general manager John Beake, would love to send Mirer to the
Broncos. There he could serve as spectator for the farewell tour of
another Demoff client, John Elway, and maybe get a chance to
compete for the position in 1999. But the Broncos like third-round
pick Brian Griese and think Jeff Lewis, who will miss the entire
season with a knee injury, has potential.
</P>
<P>
   That means Mirer probably will end up in Green Bay, where Doug
Pederson is a shaky No. 2. Coach Mike Holmgren has listened for
years to his mentor, Bill Walsh, about Mirer's suitability for the
``West Coast'' offense. The Packers even floated wide receiver Glyn
Milburn in trade talks to the Bears last week, but will settle for
getting Mirer after he is cut.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that starter Erik Kramer is vulnerable in Chicago, Blake
would consider sliding into Mirer's former backup role there. But
coach Dave Wannstedt will have to fend off the Miami Dolphins and
the Falcons, who can't feel completely comfortable with Tony
Graziani and Steve DeBerg behind Chris Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   Agent Ralph Cindrich has indicated that Blake would consider
Atlanta, and interest here could be twofold. In addition to an
experienced backup, Falcons management might view Blake as leverage
in negotiations with Chandler or a potential safety net if contract
talks with the 10-year veteran don't conclude with an extension.
</P>
<P>
   Miami coach Jimmy Johnson has seen reserve Craig Erickson
struggle all preseason and covets Blake as a backup to Dan Marino.
Cindrich represents Erickson, too, and could knock his own client
out of a job by shipping Blake to the Dolphins. That conflict,
however, won't keep Blake out of Miami if it's the best place for
him to resurrect his career.
</P>
<P>
   Other veteran quarterbacks who could become available by this
afternoon include Mike Tomczak (Pittsburgh), Wade Wilson (Oakland),
Heath Shuler (New Orleans) and Stoney Case (Arizona). They join
Billy Joe Tolliver, David Klingler, Jim Miller, Will Furrer and
Bill Musgrave as guys looking for work.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dan Reeves met early last week with Chandler to reinforce
the team's desire to keep the quarterback here. Reeves expressed
optimism that a new deal will be consummated, but general manager
Harold Richardson and agent Frank Bauer haven't had substantive
talks since Atlanta proposed a three-year extension a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Word out of Detroit is that coach Bobby Ross began calling
quarterback Frank Reich a month ago to plant the seed about coming
out of retirement. Last week, the 13-year veteran finally gave in
to Ross' pleas. His return gives the team a security blanket while
the Lions develop rookie Charlie Batch to supplant Scott Mitchell
someday. ... New Orleans coach Mike Ditka is telling confidants he
might not really want to know the identities of the veteran players
involved in the ugly hazing of second-round draft choice Cameron
Cleeland, a tight end. The reason: Some of the culprits apparently
include a few of the Saints' best players. Cleeland is said by
teammates to be ``soft,'' an irony given that he was the personal
choice of Ditka, a Hall of Fame tight end renowned for his
toughness. ... He could be a monumental distraction, but tailback
Ricky Watters still will be missed by Philadelphia coach Ray
Rhodes. His replacement, Charlie Garner, had rushed 15 times for 28
yards going into Saturday night's preseason finale. ... Carolina
faces a tough call on tailback Tim Biakabutuka. The former
first-rounder, who plays behind one-time undrafted free agent Fred
Lane, had 11 yards on 21 carries _ an average of 18.8 inches per
attempt _ entering the preseason finale at Pittsburgh. ... Don't be
surprised if the Panthers cut linebacker Greg Lloyd, who was lifted
off his feet two weeks ago by a crushing lead block from Buffalo
fullback Sam Gash. ... Kansas City coaches continue to be concerned
about a back problem that limited defensive tackle Chester
McGlockton to seven snaps in the preseason. The Chiefs signed
McGlockton to a five-year, $27.25 million contract with a $7.5
million signing bonus but did not give him a physical examination
beforehand.

 &HT;    U.S. Amateur has new faces in final
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. _ The star power is gone from the U.S. Amateur,
with Spain's Sergio Garcia conqueror of defending champion Matt
Kuchar, ousted Saturday in the semifinals at Oak Hill Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   But who, aside from shell-shocked NBC execs who wanted Seve Jr.
in the final, ripping recovery shots from the interstate, is
complaining? Now we're left with the real human drama, the stuff
that makes up this championship.
</P>
<P>
   Today's 36-hole final, beginning at 10 a.m., places together two
friends with contrasting, captivating stories. Already, however,
they share a delicious achievement, having secured spots in the
Masters in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a dream of mine forever, and now I get to go,'' said
Tom McKnight, a 44-year-old petroleum and gasoline distributor from
Galax, Va., who beat the erratic Garcia 3 and 1. ``It's awesome.
I've been offered tickets to it and been invited to come down there
and play, but I said I didn't want to go until I can be in the
tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   His opponent is 22-year-old Hank Kuehne, of the Stillwater,
Okla., family that also produced LPGA player Kelli and 1994
finalist Trip. Hank is the most talented of the three, but also the
most troubled.
</P>
<P>
   Although many feel the Southern Methodist player is longer off
the tee than Tiger Woods, he has labored to keep his life in play.
On Feb, 3, 1995, Kuehne, for three years now a recovering
alcoholic, crashed his car in Stillwater, broke his ribs and was
told by doctors he would never play golf again. When Trip, who is
on the bag this week, played at the Masters in April, 1995, his
brother was at Hazeltine, Minn., in rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't exactly let you go out on a pass to watch the
Masters,'' Hank Kuehne said.
</P>
<P>
   Kuehne destroyed UNLV's Bill Lunde 6 and 5 Saturday. He has been
sober for 39 months and thanks God every day that he did not
destroy himself or his family. He called watching on TV this week
the shakes and tears that came to John Daly, also a recovering
alcoholic, ``one of the saddest things I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been very lucky in my recovery,'' Kuehne said. ``For me,
it's a choice. If you drink, you die. That's not hard to figure
out. Let's go have a beer or let's live the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   McKnight and Kuehne have become good friends in recent years
while playing the amateur circuit, despite their difference in
years and geography.
</P>
<P>
   Putting on a game face today might be the toughest part,
considering their friendship. Joked McKnight, ``He says his friends
call him `Henry.' Well, tomorrow I might call him `Hank.'''

HACKETT ERA BEGINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Finally, it's time for the game.
</P>
<P>
   After spending eight months changing everything from his team's
road-trip attire to the hotels they will stay in before games, USC
coach Paul Hackett gets to do his real job. He will actually coach
a football game.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett makes his debut as USC's 20th head coach this morning
when the Trojans play host to Purdue in the Pigskin Classic at the
Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   It couldn't come a moment too soon for Hackett, who was so eager
to start his tenure at USC, he implored administrators to schedule
an early game. And not even the prospect of playing at an awkward
time (11:30 a.m.), day or braving the August heat could deter his
enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Hackett is more excited about getting started today
than when he was hired in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think football coaches, as long as they coach, think that
the first game is the most exciting thing,'' Hackett said. ``When
it's over, you know that incredible high or incredible low.''
</P>
<P>
   USC has had enough of the lows recently, firing John Robinson
after going 12-11 the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   That led to Hackett's hiring. His mandate is to restore the
Trojans to national prominence, and one small step would be a
victory over the up-and-coming Boilermakers before a
national-television audience.
</P>
<P>
   After changing almost every facet of the football program,
Hackett's only remaining decision is figuring out how the Trojans
will respond in a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about this team,'' Hackett said. ``What I don't
know is when the game starts, how are we going to be when the game
is on the line?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some players you can predict how they will play, but
that's not important. It's how the team plays collectively.''
</P>
<P>
   As ready as Hackett is to get started, the Trojans are just as
determined to erase the stigma of the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're mad,'' Hackett said. ``They've had two years where
they didn't feel good about themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The players certainly echo that assessment. ``We want to earn
respect,'' quarterback Mike Van Raaphorst said. ``We haven't had it
in a while, and everyone is sick of that and we want to get it
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing a game in August is the quickest way Hackett figured he
could leave the debris of the Robinson era behind and focus the
Trojans on worrying solely about 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's get this thing over with (by playing a game),'' Hackett
said. ``Win, lose or draw, we're on to next year. We've got to get
the first one under our belt.''
</P>
<P>
   But could his debut become an ambush?
</P>
<P>
   History is certainly against Hackett. USC's past six coaches
have all lost their first games, and Hackett personally witnessed
Robinson lose his opener to Missouri in 1976, 46-25.
</P>
<P>
   And Purdue may not exactly be a pushover. The Boilermakers
finished last season ranked 15th in the nation and won a bowl game
for the first time since 1984. They are almost identical to the
Trojans, returning eight starters on defense but breaking in a new
quarterback in sophomore Drew Brees.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Joe Tiller established a blueprint Hackett might monitor,
taking over an even more beleaguered program and turning it around
overnight with a 9-3 record last season, even if Purdue didn't have
to play Michigan or Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett has stressed, however, that unlike Tiller, he had to put
together a coaching staff from scratch and get back into the groove
of becoming a head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a new bunch,'' Hackett said. ``And I'm very concerned
about that.''
</P>
<P>
   This was already apparent when the Trojans burned three timeouts
during the first seven plays of their scrimmage at the Coliseum 10
days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to accept that when it happens, but I'm not
naive. Game management as a staff is my responsibility,'' Hackett
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although there was the three-season stay at Pitt (13-20-1),
Hackett will probably easily adjust to no longer requiring someone
else's approval before calling a play.
</P>
<P>
   No longer will Robinson, Bill Walsh, Tom Landry or Marty
Schottenheimer have to OK his decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to check with myself to see what we're going to do,''
Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Freshman defensive end Ryan Nielsen of Royal High will
get his college start, ahead of senior Lawrence Larry, who will
play but is recovering from a sore ankle. . . . A crowd of about
55,000-60,000 is expected. . . . Wide receiver R. Jay Soward and
free safety Darnell Lacy officially come off suspension Monday
after missing today's game for poor academic performance.

COOPER FINDS HER GAME AND SAVES HER TEAM AS COMETS FORCE A GAME 3  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MELANIE HAUSER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Now you know why Cynthia Cooper is the only most
valuable player in the history of the Women's National Basketball
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper had 27 points, 6 assists, 3 steals and impeccable timing
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when nothing went right early, Cooper and her Houston
Comets fought back late to even the WNBA two-of-three-game
championship series at 1-1 with an improbable 74-69 comeback
victory in overtime over the Phoenix Mercury.
</P>
<P>
   With a sellout crowd of 16,285 looking on at Compaq Center,
Cooper found her game late in the second half and led the Comets
into the title game here Tuesday at 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Down by 12 points with just over seven minutes left in the game,
the Comets showed why they had the best record in the WNBA as they
reeled off 13 unanswered points to take a 63-62 lead with 2 minutes
2 seconds remaining in the game. Cooper hit two free throws to put
Houston ahead for the first time since early in the game, capping a
run that started with a put-back by Yolanda Moore with 7:02 left.
</P>
<P>
   A Cooper hook shot with five minutes left cut the Mercury lead
to 7. Then, after Sheryl Swoopes ducked around a pick to block
Umeki Webbs jumper away with 3:34 left, the Comets superstars took
control of the game. Cooper, who had 15 points in the final 20
minutes of the game, hit a 3-pointer that put the Comets up
by &QC; 66-64 with 1:24 left, but Kristi Harrower, who came in off the
bench for the Mercury, tied the game at 66-66 with 31.3 seconds
left. The Mercury had a chance to win the game at the buzzer, but
Michelle Timms, the Mercury's MVP for the day, missed a jumper and
Janeth Arcain grabbed the rebound to force the overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``They blew a 12-point lead because we started to play
defense,'' Cooper said. ``We said, `let's get it done on
defense.'''
</P>
<P>
   Two blocks by Swoopes. The steal by Cooper. The rebound by
Arcain. Stifling defense. And lots of hustle.
</P>
<P>
   Michele Timms, who had 21 points for Phoenix, said of Cooper:
``You think you do a good job on her for 30, 32 minutes, but she's
like a panther that studies her prey, then suddenly she pounces on
you. And that's exactly what she did tonight. She waited until the
time was right, and until the team really desperately needed her,
and then she just picked them up, put them on her shoulders and did
it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper had plenty of help from Swoopes, who finished with 14
points, 13 rebounds and 5 assists. And the blocks. ``I don't even
remember what happened,'' Swoopes said of her block of Webb's shot.
``I was just playing and saw her come open. I just tried to get
there.'' Cooper said: ``We came together. We won this game because
we came together.''
</P>
<P>
   The Comets dominated the overtime after Cooper stole the ball
from Michelle Griffiths under the Mercury basket and went the
distance for a fast-break layup that gave Houston a 68-66 lead with
3:18 left in overtime. Swoopes hit two jumpers, and Cooper's free
throws with 11.4 seconds remaining sealed the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been involved in a lot of comebacks, but never one of
this magnitude,'' Houston Coach Van Chancellor said. ``Our players
played so well coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if his team's comeback means anything special going into
the final game, Chancellor shook his head. ``This just translates
into another good game,'' he said.

BOY'S PLIGHT WAS WORSE THAN PHOTO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The photographs of the dead boy made them sick, so they
telephoned the paper and scrawled angry notes and sent messages
over the Internet. &QL; 
``We are canceling our subscription tomorrow morning,'' a Phoenix
couple wrote. ``We were both shocked by the manner in which the
photos were displayed.''
</P>
<P>
   The photos of the dead boy were displayed on the front page,
where they belonged.
</P>
<P>
   They showed the chest and side of Nicholaus Contreraz, who died
March 2 at the Arizona Boys Ranch in Oracle. They didn't show his
face, just the torso. A specialist hired by the state found 71 cuts
and bruises on the 16-year-old's body. You saw what that meant _ 71
_ in the photographs.
</P>
<P>
   If we could have looked ``under'' the boy's skin, beneath his
ribs, we might have seen the 2{ quarts of pus in the lining of one
of his lungs. He had pneumonia. He had bronchitis.
</P>
<P>
   He had no chance. &QL; 
NOBODY CALLED GOVERNOR &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He was ignored and brutalized by the staff at Boys Ranch, forced
to do exercises and to carry a bucket of his own waste and vomit.
He was taunted and mocked and pushed until he died.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the photographs that shocked people.
</P>
<P>
   They called the paper and wrote letters and sent angry messages
over the Internet. The ones who contacted me didn't say anything
about calling the Governor's Office, though. They hadn't called a
state representative or senator, or the state Department of
Economic Security, which oversees Boys Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   They'd seen the photographs but missed the big picture.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference last week, the state said it wasn't
renewing Boys Ranch's license, for now. That could change. It
probably will change.
</P>
<P>
   The ranch has powerful friends and supporters, people who
believe in its get-tough style of dealing with juvenile
delinquents.
</P>
<P>
   A few years back, Dr. Ronald H. Davidson, director of the
mental-health policy program at the University of Illinois at
Chicago, wrote an unflattering report about the ranch, and Boys
Ranch sued him. The case was later dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pity is that they think their methods are working,''
Davidson told me last week. ``That's a joke. When you look at the
research data on boot camps, it is abysmal. You could take those
kids and put them on the moon for six months and they'd probably
have exactly the same positive outcome as if you put them at Boys
Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does that mean Boys Ranch is a success? No. Taking them out of
a negative environment is what does the trick.''
</P>
<P>
   Contreraz was from California, which has pulled all of its kids
from the ranch. There are about 150 boys still in residence. Only a
few of them are from Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the referrals continue. &QL; 
HOW MANY MAY DIE? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's because some boys do well there. Boys Ranch can parade a
long line of ``success'' stories before any government panel
questioning its methods.
</P>
<P>
   Those terrible photographs on Page One were a way of asking:
</P>
<P>
   ``How many dead boys are we willing to accept for the
successes?''
</P>
<P>
   Is one too many? Or does it matter?
</P>
<P>
   After all, the kids at Boys Ranch are there because they did
something wrong. Committed some crime. Some series of crimes. The
last thing Contreraz got picked up for was joy-riding in a stolen
car. His mother and grandmother decided they couldn't control him.
His probation officer in Sacramento suggested the facility in
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   It was supposed to straighten him out.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few months, with no one around to look out for him, he
was dead.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Davidson sent me a copy of a prayer supposedly written by
slaves in South Carolina in 1866. He thought it might apply. It
goes:
</P>
<P>
   `` Do Lawd, come down here and walk amongst yo people. And do
Lawd, come'' ``yoself. Don't send yo son. Cause this ain't no place
for chillun.'' &QL;

METS BEAT DODGERS, 4-3  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Edgardo Alfonzo found himself at shortstop for the
first time this season for the final three outs of Saturday
afternoon's game. The Mets' regular third baseman said it felt
strange, but considering the alternative, the Mets did not mind one
bit.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, Alfonzo was nearly the goat after two of his
misplays in the 10th inning almost cost the Mets a victory.
Saturday, it was Alfonzo's turn to be the hero with his bat.
</P>
<P>
   With the Mets one strike away from a particularly frustrating
3-2 defeat, Alfonzo, who had already fouled off two pitches with
two strikes, drilled a hanging fastball from Jeff Shaw into the
left-field pavilion for a two-run homer and a 4-3 victory over the
Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   And, with one fortunate swing of the bat from their third
baseman, who played the ninth at shortstop because the Mets were
out of infielders, the Mets (75-61) had taken the lead in the
National League wild-card race. After the Chicago Cubs lost in
Colorado Saturday night, the Mets led the Cubs by one game.
</P>
<P>
   According to Manager Bobby Valentine, it was the at-bats of the
Mets' two best pinch-hitters, Lenny Harris and Matt Franco, earlier
in the inning that paved the way for Shaw's hanging fastball to
Alfonzo.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did everything they could other than get a hit,''
Valentine said of the number of swings of the two pinch-hitters,
who both made outs.
</P>
<P>
   Almost nothing had gone the Mets' way until Alfonzo provided his
ninth-inning heroics. The Mets, who had rallied from a 4-0 deficit
on Friday, had put runners on base in every inning except the first
against Brian Bohanon, the former Mets left-hander. But after they
left runners on second and third in the top of the eighth, they
still had not wiped out an early 3-1 lead by the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw came in to start the ninth with the Mets one run down. The
Los Angeles closer, who had absorbed Friday night's loss, too,
retired Harris and Franco to begin the inning. But Tony Phillips,
who had earlier snapped an 0-for-21 slide, worked a walk. And then
Alfonzo's 12th home run gave the Mets a reason to believe that this
might be their year to finally make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw (3-8) threw 36 pitches in all, one day after throwing 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time he threw that sixth pitch to Alfonzo,'' Valentine
said, ``he was pretty deep into what he had left.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets still had to retire the Dodgers in the bottom of
the ninth. And because Matt Franco had pinch-hit for Rey Ordonez,
and Carlos Baerga had replaced Luis Lopez at second in the bottom
of the eighth, Alfonzo had to move to short, where he began his
professional career. Lenny Harris played third. But no balls came
Alfonzo's way, as John Franco struck out the side for his 30th
save, stranding runners on first and second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Lenny at third and Fonzie at short, so I figured I just
had to strike everyone out,'' Franco said.
</P>
<P>
   And so the Mets, with no room to spare, had not only taken Al
Leiter (13-5) off the hook, but rallied to give him a victory.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it was easy. Before Saturday, Leiter had given up only
two home runs to right-handed hitters in 436 at-bats. Saturday, he
allowed three home runs to the first six batters he faced at Dodger
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave up two bombs in a row and I'm saying to myself `settle
down,''' Leiter said, referring to the back-to-back homers by Raul
Mondesi and Bobby Bonilla that began the second inning after
Trenidad Hubbard had homered with one out in the first.
</P>
<P>
   From that point, Leiter _ who had given up just four home runs
in all before Saturday _ was virtually unhittable, as he allowed
just a fifth-inning single and an eighth-inning double. But
Bohanon, though he had surrendered 11 hits in his eight-inning
stint, had given up no homers.
</P>
<P>
   And so the Mets, after squandering opportunities, were looking
for a minor miracle heading into the ninth. Enter Alfonzo.

HACKETT HAS MORE THAN FOOTBALL TEAM IN HIS HANDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The economy spins out of control in Russia and the resulting
crash is heard halfway around the world. The ruble falls, your
stock in Coca-Cola goes flat.
</P>
<P>
   Workers on Wall Street know all about the ripple effect. The
inhabitants of Heritage Hall also are hip to it.
</P>
<P>
   Like American stockholders, people who have invested a lot of
themselves in USC athletics are holding their collective breath
these days, hoping first-year head coach Paul Hackett can find a
way to reverse the depreciation of the football team before the
rest of the athletic department is rocked by the repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   This is how far Trojans football stock has dropped: in 1995,
Sports Illustrated made USC its preseason No. 1 pick. This year,
the magazine rated the school No. 43, one spot ahead of the Purdue
team that USC will play today in its season opener at the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   You think the Central Bank of Russia is in the midst of a
currency crisis, the athletic department of USC may find itself not
having enough dollars to dole out if it doesn't start beating UCLA
and earning bowl bids.
</P>
<P>
   Like Russian President Boris Yeltsin, Hackett's imperative is to
bring order to the chaos or be devalued himself, never mind that
both men are burdened by beasts that are beyond their control.
</P>
<P>
   It's not Hackett's fault the Trojans have a seven-game losing
streak against their crosstown rival or that they haven't made a
postseason appearance since defeating Northwestern in the 1996 Rose
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   He's helpless to change the fact he was hired by an athletic
director, Mike Garrett, whose popularity among well-heeled alumni
has been on the decline since before he badly bumbled the firing of
Hackett's predecessor, John Robinson, in December.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett is no more responsible for the building of the new
women's soccer practice field or the addition, by next year, of 33
women's athletic scholarships at roughly $30,000 a head than
Yeltsin was the fall of the Berlin Wall nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Capitalism can be murder on a person's career. Just ask Yeltsin.
In the end it won't matter what circumstances Hackett inherited but
what he makes of them. He will be the one held accountable if
lucrative bowl games continue to elude the Trojans and alumni
donations fall off and the athletic department struggles to pay for
all of its concessions to Title IX.
</P>
<P>
   ``At USC the flagship sport is football,'' Hackett said Friday
after breaking camp at UC Irvine. ``I think everyone understands
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said he recognizes ``the other coaches are counting on
me doing the best I can do because (a successful football team)
helps them in recruiting and in everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The correlation was clear at Northwestern, which saw a 20
percent increase in student applications and a tenfold increase in
revenue from the sale of school-related paraphernalia after its
Rose Bowl appearance against USC.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans followed that celebratory 9-2-1 season of 1995 with
a 6-6 campaign. It didn't take an economics major to identify the
trickle-down theory at work. Cornerback Daylon McCutcheon noticed
right away that fewer victories begat fewer freebies.
</P>
<P>
   ``My freshman year, when we went to the Rose Bowl, we had Nike
gear coming in all the time,'' said the senior sociology major.
``Caps, shirts, sweatsuits, shoes. I remember thinking, `Man, this
is great. I'm going to get a closet full of this stuff every year.'
But then last year, we got, like, two T-shirts and a cap and that
was it. You notice a difference like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Other things also came into sharper focus, like whose pre-game
rituals preclude bathing. You tend to pick up on things like that
when you're riding to the hotel the night before a home game and
then to the Coliseum the next day in smallish utilitarian school
trams instead of the luxury coach buses that used to serve as your
chariots.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're not winning,'' McCutcheon said, ``things change.''
</P>
<P>
   You can sense the winds shifting when a major donor to the
school's athletic program readily acknowledges that Garrett has
alienated some of the school's loyal contributors with his antics,
which include showing the tact of a tabloid when dismissing
coaches, delivering expletive-laced pep talks in the locker room
and generally behaving like someone whose ego is on
Androstenedione.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett, a former USC running back and the 1965 Heisman Trophy
winner has ``damaged not only the athletic department but the
university,'' one member of USC's Hall of Fame Selection Committee
told the weekly New Times this past spring. ``He's damaged not only
its heritage and its people but its future.''
</P>
<P>
   As Garrett's first head-coaching hire in football, Hackett is
inexorably linked to his athletic director _ like the Titanic and
that iceberg, some would say.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of his USC head-coaching debut, Hackett was relaxed
and upbeat. He didn't look like he was headed for disaster. Of
course, before last week neither did your stocks.

from the ranch. There are about 150 boys still in residence. Only a
few of them are from Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the referrals continue. &QL; 
HOW MANY MAY DIE? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's because some boys do well there. Boys Ranch can parade a
long line of ``success'' stories before any government panel
questioning its methods.
</P>
<P>
   Those terrible photographs on Page One were a way of asking:
</P>
<P>
   ``How many dead boys are we willing to accept for the
successes?''
</P>
<P>
   Is one too many? Or does it matter?
</P>
<P>
   After all, the kids at Boys Ranch are there because they did
something wrong. Committed some crime. Some series of crimes. The
last thing Contreraz got picked up for was joy-riding in a stolen
car. His mother and grandmother decided they couldn't control him.
His probation officer in Sacramento suggested the facility in
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   It was supposed to straighten him out.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few months, with no one around to look out for him, he
was dead.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Davidson sent me a copy of a prayer supposedly written by
slaves in South Carolina in 1866. He thought it might apply. It
goes:
</P>
<P>
   `` Do Lawd, come down here and walk amongst yo people. And do
Lawd, come'' ``yoself. Don't send yo son. Cause this ain't no place
for chillun.'' &QL;

CONTEST FOR NO. 2 ARIZONA OFFICE IS HEATED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS MOESER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a state that has bounced two governors from office in 10
years, the race for secretary of state _ next in line to the top _
is worth following.
</P>
<P>
   Toss in a candidate whose pet political pursuits include UFOs
and government cover-ups, and voters in this year's Republican
primaries have one of the more intriguing contests for an otherwise
unheralded office.
</P>
<P>
   The differences between Frances Emma Barwood and Betsey Bayless
could not be more striking _ dogmatic firebrand vs. calculated
neutrality, grass-roots outsider versus political appointee, and
advocate vs. administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Barwood, a former Phoenix councilwoman, wants to aggressively
root out undocumented immigrants, who she believes are responsible
for widespread voter fraud. She is bent on that reform _ even if it
means taking on a federal government agency that says her proposal
is illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Bayless, appointed to the post last year and a one-time Maricopa
County supervisor, wants to fine-tune the agency with more moderate
reforms, on the heels of moves that included purging felons from
voter rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Many had expected Barwood to use her campaign as a platform to
renew calls on the government to release more information on UFO
sightings, such as the ``Phoenix Lights'' incident of March 1997,
when hundreds of people reported seeing a V-shaped light formation
flying over the city.
</P>
<P>
   She hasn't backed away from the UFO issue, but the former
Phoenix vice mayor is focusing on other, perhaps equally
controversial, issues.
</P>
<P>
   Barwood wants to require voters to show identification and proof
of citizenship at the polls in the 2000 presidential election. In
addition, she proposes that anyone not voting in that election be
dropped from the rolls and required to show proof of citizenship
before re-registering to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the U.S. Justice Department has outlawed using
citizenship tests for registration, Barwood, 54, promises to
challenge the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law says you have to be a legal citizen of the United
States to vote. . . . The Justice Department is saying you can't
check for that,'' Barwood said. ``In reality they're making us
break to the law by having people registered who may not be legal
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have got to get back to the way it used to be. If that
means invoking states' rights, because as the top election official
of the state, that is exactly what needs to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Barwood also wants to hold electronic town halls, perhaps using
the Internet and closed-circuit television, to keep citizens better
informed on state issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bayless, 54, who was appointed secretary of state by Gov. Jane
Hull when Hull succeeded ex-Gov. Fife Symington in 1997, scoffs at
the identification proposal, saying the Justice Department would
shut down elections in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secretary of state is not really a policy office. It is a
managerial responsibility, and it is an administrative office,''
Bayless said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secretary of state has no authority to make the policy.
The Legislature sets policy for elections. The Legislature would
have to make that move.''
</P>
<P>
   Bayless also has stepped up efforts to register groups that
tradi tionally don't vote. She mailed birthday cards to
18-year-olds containing registration information.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals illustrate the clash in styles of the two
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Barwood isn't afraid to air her views. She frequently voted in
the minority on the Phoenix City Council and was an outspoken
critic of Mayor Skip Rimsza.
</P>
<P>
   Her Web site includes links to various UFO sites and information
on government cover-ups, the federal siege at Waco &UR; and gun owners'
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely have an agenda. I haven't been appointed. And I'm
not afraid to do what is absolutely necessary,'' Barwood said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been shy. When people ask me where I stand on
whatever, they're going to get an answer.''
</P>
<P>
   She quickly reels off positions on some of the major ballot
questions this fall: Barwood opposes reauthorizing the lottery,
opposes open primaries, and supports efforts to make it more
difficult for the Legislature to amend citizen initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Bayless declines to comment on ballot measures, saying that
because her office prints ballot language, she wants to remain
neutral. She displays that cautiousness as she discusses other
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that comes from being a political insider. She was
appointed to the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors before
winning two terms in elections with no opposition. Bayless also has
served as director of the Department of Administration, acting
director of the Department of Revenue, and assistant director of
the Arizona Board of Regents.
</P>
<P>
   She also has turned out to be a fund-raising giant, raising
nearly $200,000 to Barwood's estimated $22,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bayless points to that long record of public service as
qualifying her for the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The duties of the secretary of state are pretty well
defined,'' Bayless said. ``I have an extensive background as a
manager and an administrator. I've been a public official, I've
worked in public policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the race faces House Minority Leader Art Hamilton,
who is unopposed in the Democratic primary. &QL;

ARIZONA BOYS RANCH PRESIDENT ADMITS STRING OF ERRORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DENNIS WAGNER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arizona Boys Ranch president Bob Thomas admitted to state
investigators that serious management failures and employee
misconduct led up to the death of a 16-year-old Sacramento boy in
March.
</P>
<P>
   However, during an interview with Child Protective Services,
Thomas suggested that others share blame for the tragedy of
Nicholaus Contreraz, who died of lung failure while being forced to
exercise at the camp for delinquent boys.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' comments are drawn from a two-hour interview last month
with CPS investigators from the state Department of Economic
Security, which Wednesday announced it is denying Boys Ranch's
license due to a pattern of abuse and neglect.
</P>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from the man who has headed Boys Ranch
for 22 years. Questions from investigators are paraphrased for
brevity and clarity; responses are direct quotes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Child Protective Services: This is very uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bob Thomas: Well, it's . . . I know where CPS comes from. And I
know you've got a tough job. And, uh, there's a lot of mistakes
made in this particular incident. But this is not the global
program. . . . I mean, we've done a heck of a lot of good work . .
.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, a boy died. Yes, we feel bad about it. Yes, we'll live with
it the rest of our lives. And, um, gee whiz, I also think our track
record is pretty good, and for a lot of years.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CPS: Arizona law requires child welfare employees and
organizations to protect their clients. Did the Oracle camp
supervisor ``fail to protect'' in this case?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Thomas: Failure to protect? I think no. He was doing his
duties, and he did some very good work. (He) was a good staff
member. Did he make a mistake in this one incident? Yeah, he did. .
. . Was it serious? Yes, it was. But as far as failure to protect,
I think our record is second to none. I mean, a lot of people don't
like the paramilitary approach and the whole bit. . . . But that's
always been a very safe program.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CPS: Might Contreraz still be alive today if Boys Ranch had
properly cared for him?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Thomas: You could take this one step farther. I mean, you could
take Sacramento (County Probation De partment). Should they be
charged with failure to protect? I mean, should the mother be
charged with failure to protect? Should . . . the probation officer
be charged? I mean, we're looking at fault. There's enough fault to
go around for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tragedy, and . . . I'm not trying to negate all
responsibility for Boys Ranch. . . . (But) what we also found out
was, I mean, there was a reason staff, our staff, made drastic
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CPS: Nicholaus Contreraz was sick, uncooperative and suicidal.
Why didn't Boys Ranch return him to probation authorities in
California?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Thomas: I think what happened was our philosophy of never
giving up played against us, and in some way broke our common
sense. . . . I don't know what transpired or why we, why we went
against good judgment.
</P>
<P>
   I think we were talked out of it by (probation officials) in
Sacra mento. . . . We were getting ready to terminate that
youngster (send him back to California) until they kind of, um, you
know, talked us . . . to hang on till . . . death do . . . Yeah,
the Last Chance Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CPS: Before his death, Contreraz suffered from vomiting,
breathing difficulties, diarrhea and fatigue. Why wasn't his
infection detected during repeated visits to a nurse?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Thomas: I think with our nurse, for example, she's taking a lot
of heat. And I know she's a very dedicated person. I mean, she was
a good nurse. . . . There was nothing she wouldn't do for this kid
. . .
</P>
<P>
   Did she make errors? Certainly. She had to make errors in misdi
agnosing. Now why she did it, I can't answer that. . . . We dropped
the football . . .
</P>
<P>
   Our internal investigation found . . . we feel that our medical
depart ment down there (in Oracle) was maybe too close to the
program.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CPS: Is there a written report based on that internal probe?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Thomas: We had a very extensive . . . three-week investigation.
. . . Nor mally, we'd have it written, but we didn't on this
particular time. We just went . . . they briefed me.
</P>
<P>
   (Thomas added that his investiga tion uncovered a breakdown in
supervision, which he blamed on staff inexperience, communication
failures and the fact that top managers were focused on other
programs.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CPS: Explain why those manage ment lapses occurred.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Thomas: You know, we were really into quality assurance, and we
were into goal setting. So we were teaching that, and, frankly, I
think we kind of dropped our training with some of our people in
orientation. . . . I think we didn't do the oversight of our line
staff, who are all less than a year. And I think that contributed.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CPS: Talk about the communication breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Thomas: Well, first of all, they (staff ers) didn't . . .
report some of these problems immediately with the young man. And
they should report these things immediately. . . . I mean, they
were virtually on their own. We didn't have administrative
oversight that we needed to check this thing, to lead this case . .
.
</P>
<P>
   That was an aberration. We usually have good communication. We
have our system down there was new, eight months, and I don't shuck
responsibility. . . . And, yeah, we had communication problems. We
have problems with DES, there's a chance there are going to be
communication problems. And the same thing happened down there. The
only unfortunate thing, we had an unfortunate death.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CPS: Did you know Contreraz? Did your staff ever mention him to
you?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Thomas: No, I never met the young man. I didn't really know who
he was.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CPS: What was your responsibility as director in regard to a
boy who was being considered for termina tion?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Thomas: I'm in charge of the agency. So I had to be responsible
for everything, whether I like it or not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CPS: Explain why Contreraz was forced to carry around a bucket
containing his defecation-soiled clothing.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Thomas: I would call that a degrading incident. . . . I pulled
this (staffer) in because I wanted to talk to him. I said, ``Where
did you learn this?'' That was, I mean, we don't teach these things
in training, and he admitted, no, he didn't learn this in training,
and he just didn't have an answer for me. . . . I can't fathom why
anybody would do something like that . . .
</P>
<P>
   In my opinion, these are good people. . . . They broke policy,
but they meant well. They aren't bad people. They had no intent to
hurt this kid. They truly thought this kid was a malingerer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CPS: What about testimony that Contreraz was forced to eat his
lunch while sitting on a toilet?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Thomas: I think, uh, just because he (the supervisor) was
short-staffed. I don't think they really meant to be degrading to
him (Contreraz) at that particular time. . . . And, you know, what
makes this so doggone tough, too, is (the boy's constant vomiting
and diarrhea). . . . You know, when he got mad, I guess he would do
things like this. And I'm not making excuses for staff, but . . .
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CPS: The medical examiner discov ered 71 bruises, scrapes and
other wounds on Contreraz's body. Where did they come from?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Thomas: I mean, there were just an awful lot of marks, and
probably from the CPR being performed by, a lot of it in the sand
(inaudible) for close to an hour. I mean, some people bruise easy.
You know, it's a physical program.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CPS: Did your internal investigation consider the possibility
that staffers used excessive force?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Thomas: We looked at, yeah, certainly. . . . Actually, I mean,
he (Contreraz) just flat refused to do a lot of things (work and
exercises). . . . If any thing, his last day, it was just hold him
by the belt and, you know, trying to get him to do push-ups . . .
</P>
<P>
   It's very difficult to determine was it excessive force, or was
it staff just going with the program to physically assist, which is
part of our program. We've made no bones about that. You know,
we've tried to encourage, motivate. . . . And was it part of that?
Or was it part of somebody really abusing some body?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CPS: Discuss your philosophy of working with young men.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Thomas: We're the last opportunity for these kids . . . prior
to going through some type of public correctional facility. . . .
We've always treated kids with dignity. It doesn't mean you don't
confront them, and you can't be afraid of them. . . . Ninety
percent of our problems are inmates from orientation (at the Oracle
campus). Always have been. Proba bly always will be. I mean, that's
when the kids haven't made a commitment. They want to get out of
the program. . . . They are used to manipulating the system,
beating systems. . . . But once you get them through that, I'll
tell you, once they buy in, they see the wagons are circled and
they have to . . . there's only one way out _ that you have to
start achieving.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CPS: What type of boys do you recruit?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Thomas: (Thomas said the vast major ity of placements are
serious offend ers from broken families _ minorities from the
barrios and ghettos of California.)
</P>
<P>
   If I've learned anything from this business, these kids are as
normal as any group of kids at Mountain View High School. They can
per form well. The only thing about it is they're behind. And
they're intelli gent. . . . They just never believe in themselves
that they could do it. And I think if we do anything at boys Ranch
. . . we just have a belief that we're going to work with you.
We're not going to give up on you, and we're going to see you to
the glory land. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   As the interview ended, CPS investigators notified Thomas that,
as director of Boys Ranch, he could be named as a perpetrator for
failure to protect Nicholaus Contreraz. Thomas was not among the 17
Boys Ranch workers state investigators say contributed to
Contreraz's death through neglect or abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Boys Ranch is appealing the revocation of its license. Although
its enrollment has been depleted, it will remain open while the
case is under review. &QL;

FEW RULES GOVERN CAMPAIGN FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 and MIKE MCCLOY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After two teenage pages accused him of making improper sexual
advances, state Rep. Richard Kyle did what most people would do _
he hired an attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Then he did what most people can't. He he dipped into his
campaign kitty and pulled out $360 to pay his legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle, an Ahwatukee Republican, also used contributors' funds to
hire baby-sitters; rent golf clubs; pay his AAA membership; travel
to New Orleans and La Jolla, Calif.; and buy $125 worth of gifts
three days before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   In July, he even got an $11 haircut at Supercuts, thanks to his
donors.
</P>
<P>
   And it's all legal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's fair game,'' said Kyle, who contends that all his
campaign spending is geared toward winning re-election.
</P>
<P>
   He's not alone in finding creative ways to spend contributors'
money.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Rawles, Libertarian candidate for governor, is paying
himself a $48,000 annual salary from his campaign war chest. It's
legal, according to an opinion from his lawyer, paid for with
$1,000 from the campaign fund.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Rep. John Loredo used contributors' money to pay $40
in penalties from the Secretary of State's Office for filing his
campaign reports late.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's directly campaign-related,'' Loredo said.
</P>
<P>
   While some contributors might question such uses of their
hard-earned dollars, Arizona law gives candidates virtual carte
blanche when it comes to spending campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   State campaign finance laws are limited when it comes to
controlling how candidates spend donations. The only specific ban
is on turning over surplus campaign funds for personal use, which
means candidates are allowed to use them for a wide range of
campaign purposes.
</P>
<P>
   How politicians spend their money is ``between the contributors
and the candidates,'' said Sen. Chris Cummiskey, D-Phoenix, one of
the Legislature's campaign finance reform advocates.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Cummiskey and another lawmaker looked at drafting
restrictions on campaign spending but could not settle on workable
language.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys were buying suits, sending flowers, just stuff that
really didn't have much relationship to the campaign,'' he said.
``But it was really difficult to craft a definition that would
force people to spend money on just campaign-related items.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the only political repercussion candidates face is
criticism from an opponent or an embarrassing headline for
questionable spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's something hard to justify, then you have your
contributors and the public to answer to,'' said Jessica
Funkhouser, the state elections director.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle's opponent in the Sept. 8 primary, Maricopa County
Republican Chairman Dave Crete, has sharply criticized Kyle's
spending as improper. He points to Kyle's use of campaign funds to
hire a baby-sitter on Christmas Day in 1996 so he could attend a
basketball game with a lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't anything required on Christmas Day to secure your
re-election,'' Crete said.
</P>
<P>
   He filed a complaint with Attorney General Grant Woods, but
Woods' office said there was ``insufficient evidence of intent to
violate the law'' to justify an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Vagueness in the law doesn't excuse Kyle's spending, Crete said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know upfront the (legislative) pay is rotten, and the
money you raise for your re-election is just that, for your
re-election. It isn't to augment your lifestyle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle said the letter from the Attorney General's Office
vindicates him. He declined to discuss the matter at length with
``The Arizona Republic'' because the newspaper's editorial board
endorsed Crete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was cleared. End of statement,'' Kyle said.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent letter to the ``Ahwatukee Foothills News,'' Kyle
said he could have pocketed his campaign funds as long as he
reported the money as income and declared it on his campaign
finance statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find nothing wrong in paying my baby-sitter while I attend a
political function. Likewise, if a lobbyist invites me to play golf
and does not pay for it, then my campaign fund is a legitimate
alternative,'' he wrote. ``Again, the purpose is to further
re-election.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyle's campaign finance reports show he has spent more than $700
since 1996 on baby-sitters and hundreds more on food. He also used
campaign funds on magazine subscriptions, car rentals and a $30
donation to his alma mater, Eastern Michigan University.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle's campaign reports also reveal that he used campaign funds
in February and March to pay legal fees to battle allegations of
improper sexual advances made by two teenage pages. Kyle denied the
charges and threatened a $2 million defamation suit against the
pages.
</P>
<P>
   Since Kyle relies heavily upon lobbyists for financial support,
his worries about public criticisms from contributors is slim.
</P>
<P>
   One prominent lobbyist, who asked not to be named, said he isn't
bothered by Kyle's spending habits. All he's looking for is access.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a sitting legislator, and when I need to talk with him,
he's listened to me. That's all I expect,'' the lobbyist said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more innovative campaign spenders is Rawles, the
former Maricopa County supervisor who briefly ran for governor as a
Republican last year. He is now seeking the office as a
Libertarian.
</P>
<P>
   Rawles launched his quest for governor with $26,000 left over
from his 1996 county campaign fund. He started the Libertarian
campaign with a $29,000 balance from his GOP run for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Maryann Lear of Sun Lakes, a $100 contributor, was not concerned
about Rawles drawing a $48,000 annual salary from his campaign
fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's working full time for his new campaign,'' she said. ``I
don't think it's unreasonable. He's an attorney.''
</P>
<P>
   County Auditor Ross Tate, another $100 contributor, said he
might be concerned about Rawles' party change and salary if he had
given the maximum $760 allowed by law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought his ideas were good, so I supported him,'' Tate
said. ``If I had been a big supporter, I might have had second
thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   Rawles said he cut his salary in half last month when his law
practice increased. But he expects to resume the almost
$1,000-a-week rate if he defeats fellow Libertarian Kat Gallant in
the primary to face GOP Gov. Jane Hull and Democrat Paul Johnson in
the Nov. 3 general election.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators who rise to leadership often dip into their campaign
funds for extraordinary expenses.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Art Hamilton, D-southwest Phoenix, paid
more than $1,300 last year for trips to Washington, D.C., and
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the Democratic National Committee's legislative
campaign committee and the State Legislative Leaders Foundation,
Hamilton said he gains knowledge and influences decisions in those
groups that benefit fellow lawmakers and the public.
</P>
<P>
   But when taxpayers paid for these sorts of trips, ``I just got a
little touchy about leading the pack on travel,'' Hamilton said.
``So I started paying for it with campaign money.''
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Lori Daniels, R-Chandler, reported $55 for
flowers for the speaker's wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody did that for me without asking,'' she said. ``I was
caught off guard on that one.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniels also tapped her war chest for more than $1,100 for
breakfasts and dinners for fellow Republican lawmakers over the
past two years. The majority leader is expected to provide
breakfasts while training freshman lawmakers and dinner for
Republicans working long hours as the Legislature pushes to
adjournment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're working the members so hard, and the only thing
you're giving them to eat is pizza, they're going to get sick,''
Daniels said. ``So we paid for a steak dinner. The Democrats do it,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Victor Soltero, D-Tucson, spent about $1,700 in campaign
funds on charities over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Pete Rios, D-Dudleyville, who gave $10 in campaign funds to
the Apache Junction High School volleyball team, said charities are
legitimate campaign expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how they do in small towns when somebody needs help,''
he said. ``They'll hold a golf tournament or a raffle.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty dollars for a gift to his secretary might crowd the line,
Rios admitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say this is where the campaign ends and the
official business begins,'' he said. ``But she helps take care of
constituents' concerns, and a happy constituent is going to be a
Rios supporter.'' &QL;
