<HEADLINE> US New Home Sales Slip Sharply in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. new home sales
dropped sharply in December, but the whole year of 1997 registered
the most robust sales in 19 years, the Commerce Department
reported here today.
</P>
<P>
New single-family homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 777,000 in December, a 9.3 percent decrease from the month
earlier and the sharpest decline in more than two years,
</P>
<P>
November, with a revised sales rate of 857,000, marked the
highest monthly rate in 11 years.
</P>
<P>
For all of 1997, sales totaled 800,000, up 5.7 percent from
1996 and the highest total since 817,000 in 1978. Sales all year
were supported by strong labor markets which produced the most
buoyant consumer confidence in three decades.
</P>
<P>
Besides, falling mortgage rates, the result of some investors
withdrawing from Asian markets, made home-buying more affordable.
</P>
<P>
Sales of existing homes last year totaled 4.21 million,
bringing the total of new and existing sales to just over 5
million, the most ever.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, sales rose most strongly in the South for the year,
up 7.4 percent to 362,000. There were a 6.8 percent increase in
the Northeast to 79,000, 5.3 percent in the West to 220,000, and
1.5 percent in the Midwest to 139,000.
</P>
<P>
But for December, sales fell 11.8 percent in the Northeast, 11
percent in the Midwest, 10 percent in the West and 7.9 percent in
the South.
</P>
<P>
Nationally, the median price of a new home last year was
145,500 U.S. dollars, up 3.9 percent from 1996.

<HEADLINE> Russia Confirms Result of Iraq Mediation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Tuesday confirmed "as
absolutely true" the earlier reports on the positive result of
Russia's mediation in the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
Russian presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky told a
briefing here that the mission of Russian special envoy Viktor
Posuvalyuk in Baghdad "is continuing and is producing results"
though it is premature to go into details.
</P>
<P>
The Russian media reports said on Monday that Iraq had agreed
to let the international inspectors visit eight "presidential
sites" on conditions and expressed readiness to receive head of
the U.N. Special Commission Richard Butler in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The Russian spokesman said he found it possible to say "the
stance of Iraq is changing in the direction of the world
community".
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Iraqi Foreign Ministry's statement disavowing
the understanding reached on the inspection of several facilities,
Yastrzhembsky said, "We do not coordinate the statements of our
press service with the speeches of Iraqi officials."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Russian President Boris Yeltsin "has been
dealing with the Iraqi problem very actively by using telephone
diplomacy". On Monday, Yeltsin discussed the issue with his French
and U.S. counterparts and he may continue calling other world
leaders on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Moscow's diplomatic efforts backed by France, the Arab League
and other countries show that political and diplomatic methods are
far from being exhausted and it would be wrong to wager on the use
of force, Yastrzhembsky added.
</P>
<P>
Russian presidential envoy Viktor Posuvalyuk, also deputy
foreign minister, left for Baghdad on Monday on the second visit
to seek a political solution to the Iraq crisis.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians not for Missile Attack Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 3 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) said in the West Bank city
of Ramallah Tuesday that the Palestinians objected to missile
attack against Israel.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with four Israeli Knesset (parliament)
members, PNA Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo stressed that
the Palestinians opposed firing missiles armed with biological or
chemical warheads at Israel.
</P>
<P>
Rabbo said that the Palestinians support the implementation
of the U.N. Security Council resolution regarding to the work
of the U.N. weapon inspectors in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Palestinian officials have declared that
they hoped the Iraqi crisis would be resolved through diplomacy
and they supported the struggle of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
PNA envoy Azzam Ahmed, who brought with him a message to
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein from PNA President Yasser Arafat,
arrived in Baghdad Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, Ahmed told the voice of Palestinian
Radio that " President Arafat felt it was necessary to reiterate
the Palestinian concern for the safety of the Iraqi people and to
assure the Iraqi leadership that we would like to see a peaceful
solution.
</P>
<P>
Israeli opposition Labor party Knesset (parliament) members
Yossi Beilin, Hagai Miron, Yair Dayan and Yonel Yahal took
part in the Tuesday's meeting with Rabbo.
</P>
<P>
Labor leader Ehud Barak has said that as long as the
crisis with Iraq continues, the Labor party will stand behind
the government.
</P>
<P>
He noted the government has to abide by two guide-lines:" to
keep its eyes wide open and to cooperate in a responsible manner
with the U.S.."
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also indicated Monday
that Israel has capabilities to defend itself against any
possible attack during crisis with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
After her meeting with Israeli leaders, the visiting
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has said that the
U.S. is ready to use "substantial force" against Baghdad and
nothing will shake the American commitment to Israeli security.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein reportedly has set up a
special unit to maintain his biological weapons system and
keep the United Nations' inspectors from discovering it.
</P>
<P>
A senior official of the United Nations inspection team in
Iraq said last week that Iraq had a sufficient quantity of
biological weapons to destroy the population of the Israeli
coast city of Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
During 1991 Gulf War, 39 Iraqi Scud missiles were launched at
Israel after U.S.-led allied forces waged a war against Iraq.
Israel bowed to U.S. pressure not to retaliate and bomb Iraq, and
in return, the U.S. transferred Patriot missile batteries to
Israel. The patriots, however, failed to intercept the
Scuds.

<HEADLINE> Albania Unveils Ambitious Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Albanian government has put
forward an ambitious budget to pursue quicker economic growth and
lower fiscal deficit in the new year.
</P>
<P>
The budget, which was presented to the parliament on Monday,
envisages a 10 percent growth of gross domestic product (GDP) and
a 10 percent inflation rate while narrowing the fiscal deficit
6.4 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the Albanian government will provide 13 billion lek
(about 86.7 million U.S. dollars) in investment and encourage the
private sector to invest 13 billion lek. It plans to create 50,000
to 60,000 new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Fatos Nano said the current government
began its work in a very difficult economic and financial
situation caused by the fake fund-raising earlier last year.
</P>
<P>
He said that with the help of the International Monetary Fund,
the country has managed to recover economic balance, bring an end
to the state of economic emergency and enter a new period of
economic reconstruction, consolidation and development.
</P>
<P>
Nano said that in the new year, the government will be strict
in implementing economic policy and curtailing public
spending. This is the only way to eventually establish a normal
financial order, he said.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Criticizes UN Proposal on Oil-for-food Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Iraq said Tuesday United
Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan's recent proposal to increase
the amount of oil Iraq can sell under the oil-for-food deal was
meant to weaken its call to lift the economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the offer, an Iraqi official spokesman, who
usually keeps anonymous, told reporters that irrespective of
Annan's good intentions, it was a product of the United States,
and probably Britain.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the two countries intended to "steal" more
than 50 percent of Iraq's oil proceeds, which he said actually has
been the case, under the cover of the oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
Annan Monday asked the U.N. Security Council to raise the
amount of oil Iraq can sell to 5 billion U.S. dollars from 2
billion dollars every six months.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed an economic sanction on Iraq, banning oil
export, in 1990 after its invasion of Kuwait. The U.N. and Iraq
signed the oil-for-food deal in 1996 allowing Iraq to sell the limited
amount of oil to buy food and medicine for its people.
</P>
<P>
"The only solution that could put an end to Iraqs' suffering,
is the total and comprehensive lifting of the embargo on Iraq
without any delay," said the Iraqi spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, Iraq's wealth would remain an arena for ill
intentions, under this cover or that allegation, against Iraqi
people's sovereignty, security, independence and interests, the
spokesman added.

<HEADLINE> Report: Logs Show Lewinsky's White House Visits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Monica Lewinsky, the former
White House intern at the center of a scandal involving U.S.
President Bill Clinton, reportedly visited the White House three
dozen times after leaving her job there to work at the Pentagon in
1996.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times, citing visitation log books as the source
for its story, said Tuesday that the woman was usually cleared for
entry by Clinton's personal secretary.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Pentagon said the trips were not related to
her job at the press office there.
</P>
<P>
Officials familiar with the White House logs did not describe
Lewinsky's ultimate destination in the White House or the purpose
of her visits, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky's White House visits have been seen by many as a
crucial piece of information as independent counsel Kenneth Starr
investigates accusations that Clinton had a sexual relationship
with Lewinsky and encouraged her to lie about it. The president
has strongly denied the allegation.

<HEADLINE> Female Condoms to Appear in Tanzanian Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Female condoms will
appear in the Tanzanian market in the first quarter of this year,
local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
The female condoms, to be distributed by the Population
Services International (PSI), are aimed at preventing HIV and
other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), as well as unwanted
pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
"We are now working on a research to determine its
acceptability in Tanzania," Dr. Richard Frank, the president of
PSI, told reporters at the Sheraton Hotel here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Frank, who arrived in Tanzania last week, said the products
will be sold at affordable prices to allow more people including
the low-income earners to have access to the gadgets.
</P>
<P>
PSI, a non-profit international organization, began the
activities in the east African country in December 1993 by
distributing Salama condoms which are widely sold across the
country.
</P>
<P>
The organization has already sold over 30 million pieces of
condoms in Tanzania. A packet of three condoms is priced at 50
shillings (640 shillings equal to one U.S. Dollar), affordable to
the majority of people.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania is said to be leading in Africa with high number of
HIV/AIDS victims. As of December of 1996, there were 88,667
reported cases in the country, a number which the National AIDS
Control Program estimates to represent only 20 percent of the
real number.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 3 (Xinhua)-- Iraqi Culture and Information
Ministry has started to expand its press center to face the
increasing influx of foreign reporters before a possible
U.S. military strike against Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Director General Uday al-Taie of the Iraqi News Agency (INA)
told reporters Tuesday that the current press center, founded
after the 1991 Gulf War, provides press services in both Arabic
(from 07:00 GMT to 21:00 GMT) and English (from 09:00 GMT to
15:00 GMT) through INA.
</P>
<P>
Al-Taie said the ministry is looking into more requests presented
by tens of foreign correspondents to obtain visas for entering
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi press center of nearly 200 square meters is now
packed with more than 100 correspondents and cameramen from
Arab and world news networks and agencies.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain have threatened to launch military strikes
at Baghdad to force Iraq to comply with U.N. resolutions and to
allow U.N. arms inspectors free access to any suspected sites
including those presidential palaces in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright Arrived in Cairo
Tuesday afternoon at the last stop of her week-long tour in Europe
and the Mideast to mass up support for a possible military strike
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Albright has toured France, Spain, Britain, Israel, the
Palestinian self-rule areas, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf emirates, where the U.S. maintains its forces ashore
and afloat, have backed Washington Tuesday in warning Iraq of
grave consequences if it fails to comply with U.N. demands for
granting its special commission team full access to suspected
weapons sites.
</P>
<P>
The inspectors have to verify Iraq has destroyed its chemical
and biological weapons programs to pave way for lifting a
seven-year-old U.N. embargo imposed on Iraq after the 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
France, Russia and China have been resisting the tough
U.S. stance and are still pressing for a non-military solution to
the crisis.

developed in an overall smooth way. The Sino-Swiss relationship
has been closer and closer in recent years, he added.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have maintained a good political relationship
and broadened their economic relationship day after day, Li said.
There has been also satisfactory progress in cooperation of
finance, science and technology, an education, he noted.

trade and economy.

access. The Swiss government fully supports China's early

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Rejects Press Reports on Delivery of Russian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government Tuesday
rejected Turkish press reports that a strike at a factory in St
Petersburg would delay delivery of the Russian-made S-300
missiles to Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing, government spokesman
Manolis Christofides said he had contacted Russian Ambassador
Georgi Muratov to Cyprus over the recent report in the
Internet edition of the Turkish daily Hurriyet.
</P>
<P>
"The S-300s are not being manufactured by one factory, but
dozens of factories are co-operating together," the spokesman
said, adding the assurance is repeated that the missiles will be
delivered.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a report in the Cypriot paper Tharros that
a team of 52 National Guard officers was being trained on
the missiles system in Russia, Christofides confirmed that
"personnel for the S-300s are being trained".
</P>
<P>
He said the governments of Russia and Cyprus had decided
on a time-frame, and this would be adhered to.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government signed a contract early 1997 with
Russian manufacturers for the purchase of the missiles, expected
to be deployed in the summer.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has responded to the arms deal with threats of a
preemptive strike if the missiles are deployed.
</P>
<P>
However, the Cypriot government has reiterated that it could
cancel the deal if President Glafcos Clerides' proposal for
demilitarization of the island is materialized, or the peace
talks on Cyprus settlement make progress.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the island in
the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Supports Diplomatic Efforts to End Iraqi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait's Information
Minister Sheikh Saud Nasser Al-Sabah said Tuesday that Kuwait
supports diplomatic efforts to end Iraqi crisis over U.N.
arms inspection operations in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The minister told editors-in-chief of local daily newspapers
and magazines that Kuwait supports international efforts towards
guaranteeing a full Iraqi cooperation with the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of destroying Iraqi mass
destruction weapons through peaceful methods.
</P>
<P>
He said such efforts aim at sparing the Iraqi people the
suffering that might result from a possible military strike
which may be launched if Iraq continues to refuse to allow
the inspectors to search sites in Iraqi Presidential Palaces.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minister expressed Kuwait's firm backing of
the U.S. stand towards Iraq's non-compliance with UN mandates.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait said it would support U.S. military action against Iraq
if the current crisis made it necessary after a meeting between
Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah and the U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright Sunday.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) is providing 200,000 U.S. dollars to
help the government and the people of Uganda cope with cholera and
other emergencies thought to be caused by the El Nino phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
A release from UNDP said an estimated 400 people have died so
far from cholera, which has spread to 18 Ugandan districts and is
being blamed on poor sanitation and incessant rains.
</P>
<P>
The funding will help strengthen logistical coordination,
distribute disinfectants and gloves and carry out a public
information campaign.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rains have disrupted the already vulnerable livelihoods
of people in many parts of Uganda, some losing their homes and
other property. UNDP assistance will also be used to improve

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Discusses L/Cs Guarantees With Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
and visiting Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong discussed here
Tuesday evening the efforts of several countries to guarantee
Indonesia's letters of credit (L/Cs) with a view to reviving the
country's exports.
</P>
<P>
"Our problem is that several foreign countries or banks no
longer have confidence in the L/Cs we issue," Soeharto said after
a 90-minute discussion with Goh at his residence, Jalan Cendana in
Central Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States and Australia have already agreed to
give their businessmen guarantees on various commodities Indonesia
would buy from them.
</P>
<P>
"This guarantee will smoothen Indonesia's imports," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president added that foreign businessmen or exporters need
not worry about Indonesia's capability to pay for its imports
because the country's foreign exchange reserves are enough to
finance imports for four months.
</P>
<P>
"We have foreign exchange reserves to pay for the imports
covered by our L/Cs," he declared, adding that if the L/C problem
could be solved the current monetary crisis could also overcome.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto reaffirmed his confidence that the Indonesian economy
would recover from its crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore prime minister, who arrived here at noon,
meanwhile said the basic idea that has been extended to Soeharto
is the formation of a multilateral committee with members coming
from various countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that if eight countries agree to give a guarantee of
only 1 billion U.S. dollars each for L/C from Indonesia, there
would be at least 8 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The guarantee of funds would be very important because one of
the problems faced by Indonesia is how to finance its trade,
particularly its imports, Goh stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said the economic recovery program Indonesia has embarked on
is already on the right track and Singapore would soon formulate a
paper containing details of the international guarantee plan.
</P>
<P>
Following the sharp fall of the Indonesian rupiah against the
U.S. dollar and the closing down of 16 private banks in November
last year, confidence in the country's banking sector waned. The
public withdrew their deposits and foreign banks became
increasingly reluctant to accept letters of credit issued by
Indonesian banks. The rupiah was traded at 11,300 per dollar
Tuesday, losing about 80 percent of its value since July last
year.
</P>
<P>
Goh's last visit to Indonesia was on January 13 as part of
emergency initiatives by countries and organizations including the
United States, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Singapore
to halt Indonesia's deepening economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Singapore has pledged 5 billion U.S. dollars in standby loans
to Indonesia as part of a 43 billion dollar rescue package led by
the IMF.

<HEADLINE> 12,000 Commit Suicide Each Year in France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Some 12,000 people have committed
suicide each year in France since 1993, said the official National
Institute of Demographical Studies (INED) today.
</P>
<P>
With a suicide rate close to 20 for 100,000 residents in the
country, France is ranged the fourth among the Western countries
with the highest rates of suicides, after Finland, Denmark, and
Austria, said the INED.
</P>
<P>
The major causes for suicides in France are economic crisis,
unemployment, isolation as well as a decrease of the number of
religious services and practices, said the INED.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, 12,500 people committed suicide in France as compared
with 8,300 in 1975 and an average of 6,000 in the 1950s, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that the age groups that are most
vulnerable to suicide are those of younger people, as the number
of suicides increased by 3.5 times among the people from 25 to 34
years old and by three times among those from 20 to 24 years old
between 1950 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
The number of deaths resulting from suicides in France has now
surpassed that of traffic accidents, also one of the highest among
Western countries, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The INED report was published on the National Day Against
Suicide, which was first held last year.

<HEADLINE> Somali Meetings Mark Peace in Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Peace rallies and festivals
were held here in the Somali capital Tuesday following the
successive meetings by the main faction leaders in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people led by well known Moslem scholars, local
human rights organizations, businessmen and women groups took to
the main streets of the capital especially around the former
green lines that divided Mogadishu for the past seven years,
hailing the arrival of peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators from all the districts of the capital
including Wardhigley, Bondhere, Hawlwadag and Shingani have then
gathered at the Unknown Soldier's Monument right at the heart of
the city where the heavy fighting between Ali Mahdi and late
General Aidid erupted in late 1991.
</P>
<P>
People carried placards and national flags, while some were
waving green leaves, and they were then addressed by Somalia's
most prominent religious leader, Sheikh Mohamed Moallim Hassan,
who told the crowed to return to their Allah and the rule of his
Holy book.
</P>
<P>
Habiba Hassan Mohamud, who spoke on behalf of the women
groups, has declared their support for the Cairo Peace
Declaration and pledged that the women groups will spare no
effort in collaborating with the on-going peace activities in
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The area where the Unknown Soldiers Monument lies has been
cleaned up and life has returned to it for the first time Tuesday
after it has been a no man's land since November 17, 1991.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi's press secretary, Hussein Sheikh Ahmed Kadare, who
also attended the rally has congratulated the people for the end
of all the political differences between the faction leaders.
</P>
<P>
Kadare also said that Mogadishu's airports and seaports will
soon be re-opened under joint committees.
</P>
<P>
During the rally, Maki Hagi Banadir, the famous singer, sang
his famous songs for the crowd accompanied by the Banadir Star
musical band which also played many national songs for the
jubilant people.
</P>
<P>
Another large demonstration is scheduled to take place at
Mogadishu's main soccer stadium in Wardhigley district where all
the faction leaders, influential politicians and community elders
will attend. The leaders will address the largest crowd they've
ever seen before them since the collapse of the late regime in
1991.

ATHENS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The standard of the Greek armed

Commenting on Washington's decision to discontinue military aid

Washington's intention to discontinue the military assistance had

<HEADLINE> More Investment Urged for Mozambique's Beira </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Another international meeting
aiming at attracting investment for the Beira Corridor in
Mozambique's central port city Beira is planned for March, a
senior official said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Paulo Muxanga, the Mozambican Transport Minister, said that
his government is preparing for the conference together with the
Zimbabwean government.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the joint program will promote trade
and investment, and create job opportunities for people of both
Mozambique and Zimbabwe, according to Mozambican Information
Agency.
</P>
<P>
The first Beira Corridor Investment Conference was held in
Harare, Zimbabwe in December 1996, when Mozambique, Malawi,
Zambia and Zimbabwe decided to add "development programs" into
the agreement for the corridor.
</P>
<P>
The Entrepreneurs' Council for Beira Development Corridor, set
up Monday, is composed of entrepreneurs from Mozambique's central
provinces of Sofala, Manica, Tete and Zambezia as well as those
from two Zimbabwean provinces, and it is aimed at promoting
trade, investment and job opportunities for areas along the Beira
Corridor between the two southern African countries, Paulo said.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican and Zimbabwean governments would help
entrepreneurs by channeling personnel and material resources, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Projects of Beira Development Corridor include the buildings
of highways and railway networks and the laying of petroleum
pipelines, which will link Beira port with Mutare city in eastern
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The Beira Corridor program was initiated in February last year
after a tender meeting in Zimbabwe in December, 1996, at which
Mozambique, Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe signed an agreement on
the establishment of the Beira Development Corridor.

<HEADLINE> S. African Varsities in Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Days after the start of
the new school year, South African universities found themselves
in a deepening financial crisis as students fail to pay their
outstanding tuition fees.
</P>
<P>
Among student protests, many of the country's big universities
tightened debt recovery controls by adopting drastic measures
such as barring students with outstanding fees from registration
and graduation, South African Press Association reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The University of Durban-Westville said it was in a
"precarious situation" with total student debts of 32.6 million
Rand (6.6 million U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
It said about two thirds of its students had defaulted on
their fees.
</P>
<P>
The University of the North West said huge debts have put it
in a "desperate" financial position and forced it to consider all
options to cut costs, including reducing non-academic staff.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the payment of outstanding fees, the university did
not allow the 2,900 students who owed the university more than 4
million Rand (808,000 Dollars) to register or graduate.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile it was consulting with student representatives on
the issue to forestall student protests, which were reported in
some universities, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The crisis flared up Sunday when 308 students at the
University of Western Cape were arrested for resisting eviction
from the student residences while refusing to pay their fees.
</P>
<P>
The university authorities said more than 52 million Rand
(10.5 million Dollars) of debt has left it unable to fulfill its
financial obligations.
</P>
<P>
The University of the Witwatersrand and the University of Cape
Town, the country's two most prestigious universities, said they
were owed about 10 million Rand (more than two million Dollars)
and 15 million Rand (3.03 million Dollars) respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, both universities expected to recoup most of the
money in the next few weeks.

<HEADLINE> Kaporo Re-Elected Speaker of Kenya's New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Francis Kaporo who is loyal to
the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) was re-elected the
speaker of the eighth Kenyan National Assembly Tuesday with 157
votes in favor.
</P>
<P>
His rival Njelu Gatabaki of the Social Democratic Party (SDP)
got only 60 votes at the first session of the new 222-member
parliament. There were four votes spoiled and one abstention.
</P>
<P>
In a speech following his elect, Kaporo, a lawyer and former
minister in his sixties, said he will make efforts in his
five-year term starting 1998 to improve and coordinate the
parliament's operation so that it can "serve all the people of
Kenya" and "give the best to the society."
</P>
<P>
Later, Joab Omino of the National Development Party (NDP) was
elected the deputy speaker at the second ballot with 151 votes in
favor. Democratic Party (DP)'s candidate Martha Karua and
FORD-Kenya's Muknisa Kityui got 41 and 20 votes respectively.
</P>
<P>
Under the constitution, elected speakers must receive no less
than two-third of votes (around 148 votes) in parliament. Omino
got 141 votes at the first ballot.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the session, some 50 opposition lawmakers
chanted and shouted slogans in demonstrations against the current
ethnic clashes which have claimed more than 100 lives in the Rift
Valley Province since January 11.
</P>
<P>
But when the elections formally started, the atmosphere was
peaceful and pleasant, eye-witnesses said, adding the whole
session went through very smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of the 109 opposition lawmakers, led by DP
Chairman Mwai Kibaki, issued a joint statement Monday threatening
to disrupt the elections of speakers until the KANU government
effectively stops the ongoing clashes in the country.
</P>
<P>
They also called for a stay-at-home strike in capital Nairobi
Wednesday and planed to hold a rally downtown Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Peter Kimanthi said in a statement Monday
that calm has returned to violence-hit areas and no deaths have
occurred since January 26.
</P>
<P>
KANU, with 113 seats, has its slimmest-ever majority in the
new assembly elected in the country's second multi-party poll
held on December 29 and 30.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parliamentary camp consists of nine parties,
including DP with 41 seats, NDP 22, FORD-Kenya 18, SDP 16, Safina
(Ark Noah in Swahili) six and FORD-people three.

ATHENS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Greece would take new measures
this year to combat the country's growing unemployment, which
currently stands at around 10 percent, Greek Labor and Social
Security Minister Miltiades Papaioannou said today.
</P>
<P>
He said that to deal with unemployment and create 68,000 new
jobs, the Greek government would this year spend 108 billion
drachmas (about 376 million U.S. dollars). Of the amount, 81
billion drachmas (about 282 million dollars) would come from the
European Social Fund while 27 billion drachmas (about 94 million
dollars) from Greece itself, he added.
</P>
<P>
The government had worked out two principal programs to fight
the country's jobless, he said, adding that the first program
would direct at the unemployed aged between 20 and 27 and the
second one at helping the people between the ages of 28 and 64 who
had long been out of work and whose prospects of finding a job
were not good.

LAGOS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- A tribunal to try Nigeria's
number two person, chief of general staff Lt.-gen. Oladipo Diya,
and 11 others being detained in connection with a coup plot is
expected to be convened this week, the military said today.
</P>
<P>
This followed last week's submission of the report of a
special investigation board at the end of its mission for nearly
one month.
</P>
<P>
At least 60 people were invited by the panel during the
investigation and some audio-video materials about the foiled
coup attempt have been shown to senior military and government
officials, traditional rulers, the diplomatic corps and media
executives.
</P>
<P>
"The tribunal would be constituted and convened by chief of
defense staff Maj.-gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar," said Col. Godwin
Ugbo, acting director of defense information.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar announced on December 21 last year the uncovering of
the coup plot, which also involves former communications minister
Maj.-gen. Tajudeen Olanrewaju and former works and housing
minister Maj.-gen. Abdulkarim Adisa.
</P>
<P>
According to the defense spokesman, all the 12 people being
held would be allowed access to "lawyers of their choice". But he
refused to say whether civilian lawyers would be accepted.
</P>
<P>
Sources here recalled that civilian lawyers were allowed
during previous trials, including those trials of nine air force
officers who were tried recently for fraud.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Trade value between members of
the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA)
increased by 11.5 percent in 10 years from 1985 to 1995,
according to Zambia News Agency (ZANA).
</P>
<P>
In a statement released in Lusaka Tuesday, the secretariat of
the COMESA said that intra-COMESA trade increased from 834
million U.S. Dollars in 1985 to 2.5 billion in 1995.
</P>
<P>
It attributed the increase to the economic liberalization
through tariff reduction and elimination of non-tariff barriers
and restructuring and privatization among member countries in the
sub-region.
</P>
<P>
The secretariat stressed that the reduction of non-tariff
barriers which combined with most countries registering positive
growth rates in their economies gives hope to the attainment of a
single market.
</P>
<P>
As the year 2000 comes near, the secretariat has worked out a
program of action to push for zero tariffs rating so that the
20-member regional body can reach its target of establishing the
single market in the year, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The program includes continued assessment of revenue losses
implied by application for tariff reduction and a way of
compensation for the losses.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Fishing Capacity Put at 300,000 Ton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is capable of turning
about 300,000 tons of fish products annually if it harnesses only
10 percent of its fisheries potentials, an expert has said.
</P>
<P>
If the potentials were harnessed, Nigeria would meet its fish
food sufficiency, said Tunde Ajayi, acting director of the
Nigerian Institute for Oceanography and Marine Research, quoted
by the News Agency of Nigeria Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to him, Nigeria has 750,000 hectares of fisheries
potentials and the technological competence to harness the rich
potentials.
</P>
<P>
The Niger Delta, the largest inland river basin for example,
was currently "totally" under-utilized, he told visiting Minister
of State for Agriculture Frank Adejuwon here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"In spite of the huge potentials of aquaculture, estimated
annual fish-farm is less than 100,000 tons in all of Africa
compared with 380,000 tons in the Philippines, 519,000 tons in
Thailand, 1.6 million tons in India and 10.6 million tons in
China," Ajayi said.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the low production level in Nigeria and Africa
to what he termed the dearth of skilled aquaculture manpower.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Ministry of Agriculture to create a fisheries
extension center for the continuous training of the extension
agents and for hand-on demonstrations of innovations and
technologies.

Ter-Petrosyan announced his resignation at the national television

The president's resignation came in the wake of a political

Ter-Petrosyan's resignation was preceded by a string of

<HEADLINE> Child Labor Risks Grow in Africa: ILO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The number of child laborers
in Africa is expected to swell by at least one million annually
in the next 10 to 15 years if the continent remains predominately
rural, the International Labor Office (ILO) warned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The number of African child laborers now stands at around 80
million, but could surge to more than 100 million by 2015, the
body said at a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
Child labor is an overwhelmingly rural phenomenon, with as
many of 70 percent of all child workers worldwide involved in
agricultural production, the ILO noted. Most African economies,
particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, are predominately rural.
</P>
<P>
"If present trends continue," said the ILO in a report, "at
least a further 400,000 children per year in sub-Saharan Africa
aged six to 11 would remain out of school and would, in all
likelihood, join the pool of child laborers."
</P>
<P>
Adding the increasing number of children who try to combine
work and school, there will be a total of at least one million
new child workers on to the labor market per year for the next
10-15 years, it continued.
</P>
<P>
"The poverty, population and education indicators give a
potentially bleak picture for the future of child labor in
Africa," said the report with the title of "Child Labor in Africa
-- Targeting the Intolerable."
</P>
<P>
The report is prepared for an international conference which
will be attended by employer and worker organizations and
governments of 22 African countries in the Ugandan capital city
of Kampala from Thursday to Saturday this week.
</P>
<P>
The conference, sponsored jointly by ILO and the Organization
of African Unity (OAU), aims to help develop and effectively
implement national policies to reduce and eliminate child labor.
</P>
<P>
Africa already has the highest incidence of child labor, with
almost 41 percent of all children between five and 14 years old
involved in economic activity -- versus 21 percent in Asia and 17
percent in Latin America, according to the ILO data.
</P>
<P>
Participation rates of children in the labor force are higher
in sub-Saharan Africa where nearly half of the children aged
between 10 and 14 are working.
</P>
<P>
ILO estimates suggest that in Benin, 27 percent of children
are working while in Burkina Faso 51 percent, in Mali 54 percent
and in Burundi 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
The figures are between 40 and 46 percent in Kenya, Ethiopia,
Niger and Uganda and between 20 to 30 percent in Cote d'Ivorie,
Nigeria and Zimbabwe, said the ILO report.
</P>
<P>
In the developing world, Africa has also the highest
participation rate of girls -- approximately 37 percent of girls
work across the continent, compared with 20 percent in Asia and
11 percent in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Primary schooling, a key indicator of child labor levels,
shows that the actual number of children in the primary school
range (six to 11 years old) who are not enrolled in school jumped
by some two million from 1990 to 1995 to hit nearly 40 million.
Two-thirds are girls.
</P>
<P>
Household work is reported to be the main reason for about
one-third of the youngsters who do not attend the school,
according to the report.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 3 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's ruling
party African National Congress (ANC) Tuesday announced a
three-member internal commission to probe corruption allegations
against new Gauteng Premier Mathole Motshekga.
</P>
<P>
Gauteng, where Johannesburg and Pretoria are situated, is the
richest province in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The commission would have to submit its final report with its
findings and recommendations to ANC's decision-making body, the
National Executive Committee, by March 2 this year, ANC
Secretary-General Kgalema Motlanthe said in a media statement.
</P>
<P>
Motlanthe said the commission's terms of reference were to
investigate and report on certain allegations emanating from
media reports on the alleged improper conduct of Motshekga during
the period from 1986 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said the commission would report on:
</P>
<P>
-- allegations concerning Motshekga's possible involvement in
the alleged fraudulent administering and unapproved use of
international donor funding;
</P>
<P>
-- allegations of a lack of financial accountability and
inadequate planning as far as international donor funding is
concerned;
</P>
<P>
-- allegations concerning nepotism and autocratic management;
</P>
<P>
-- the exact nature of Motshekga's relationship with anybody
in so far as it may have had a negative effect on the ANC.
</P>
<P>
The newly sworn-in premier was alleged to have mismanaged
funds from a Dublin-based company which were to have been used
for legal clinics during the apartheid years.
</P>
<P>
He was also reported to have lied about the date he resigned
from a company involved in the province's high stakes contest for
gambling rights.
</P>
<P>
However, Motlanthe said the resignation date did not warrant
any investigation.

<P>
LAGOS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations humanitarian
team visited Sierra Leone Monday to assess the humanitarian needs
of civilians suffering from UN and regional sanctions against the
west Africa's ruling military junta.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here Tuesday said the team of four officials
crossed by road from Guinea to visit the Northern Province
capital Makeni and other towns in the region.
</P>
<P>
The report, however, quoted the special UN envoy for Sierra
Leone Francis Okello as saying that any immediate large-scale
assistance would be impossible until peace-keepers are deployed
in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Full relief operations can only start when ECOMOG (west
Africa's peace-keeping force) and UN troops are deployed," Okello
reportedly said.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the UN sent a fact-finding team to Freetown to
assess what is needed to launch humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
The UN in October last year imposed sanctions against the
Sierra Leonean military junta led by Major Paul Johnny Koroma,
who came to power last May in a military coup that overthrew
elected civilian president Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said the food situation in Sierra Leone is
grave, with starvation growing.

<HEADLINE> EU Internal Reforms Should Slow Down Enlargement: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Polish Prime Minister
Jerzy Buzek today expressed the hope that the slow-moving
internal reforms of the European Union (EU) would not pose a
hindrance to the bloc's enlargement into eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
Buzek said that he expected very difficult membership negotiations
with the EU, which are due to be formally launched on March 31.
</P>
<P>
During the negotiation process and implementation of its
results, Poland would continue to count on Bonn's assistance, said
Buzek, who started a two-day visit to Germany today.
</P>
<P>
There have been controversies within the EU as to how to
arrange the priority between EU internal reforms and its
enlargement.
</P>
<P>
While France says that the EU should first make progress on its
reforms before taking in any new members, Germany hopes that
reforms and enlargement should go parallel.
</P>
<P>
Although the EU has not set any date for taking in new members,
none of the 11 selected candidate states, including Poland, is
expected to join the 15-nation bloc before the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
As to Poland's membership in the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), Buzek expressed the hope that all 16 NATO
members would give the green light in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
NATO leaders agreed last year to take in Poland, the Czech
Republic and Hungary in 1999 as the first wave of new members.
However, their memberships have still to be finally endorsed by
parliaments of all the current NATO member states.
</P>
<P>
According to German government spokesman Peter Hausmann, Kohl
had assured Buzek that Germany would continue to support Poland in
its efforts to prepare for joining both NATO and the EU.

<P>
OTTAWA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Canada's French-speaking
province of Quebec has said it is determined to fight the high
suicide rate, which is at 19 for every 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The rate is the third highest in the industrialized world,
behind only Hungary and Finland, whose suicide rates are at 34 and
27 for per 100,000 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Quebec Health Minister Jean Rochon has announced that his
government will spend over 700,000 dollars (480,000 US dollars)
over three years on prevention programs and public education.
</P>
<P>
The government has already spent close to 2.5 million dollars
on the suicide problem, said reports today.
</P>
<P>
Suicides have risen progressively in Quebec since the early
1970s, with especially high numbers in 1982, 1983 and the
beginning of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Painful economic recessions are "surely an additional factor
that can probably increase the risk of those people" who took
their own lives, Rochon was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed any suggestion that the constitutional debate may
have driven the suicide rate up.

LONDON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
continued to rally today and all ended at new record closing
highs, overcoming the influence of weakness in New York and a bout
of early profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
Britain's FTSE 100 index of leading shares closed up 13.8

Takeover activity dominated the news as several predators made

Business was also boosted by expectations that interest rates

<HEADLINE> Israeli Rightists Vandalize Rabin's Memorial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Israelis Tuesday cleaned up
the memorial for late prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, which has been
vandalized by rightists.
</P>
<P>
Monday night, Jewish extremists painted sentences of "Rabin is
a traitor" and "Rabin is a murderer" on the memorial erected last
year.
</P>
<P>
The outlawed rightist Kach Movement claimed responsibility for
the action, which was condemned by politicians from both the
ruling right-wing Likud Party and the oppositions of Labor and
Meretz.
</P>
<P>
The Kach Movement said the action was in retaliation for a
decision of the Israeli Knesset (Parliament) to remove the
memorial they erected for Baruch Goldstein.
</P>
<P>
Goldstein shot dead 29 Palestinian Muslim prayers in the Tomb
of Patriarch (Ibrahim Mosque called by Muslims) in Hebron in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset approved Monday a bill that bans building memorials
for anyone who carried out an act of terror.
</P>
<P>
Rabin, chief architect of the Israeli-Arab peace process, was
gunned down by Jewish rightist Yigal Amir in November 1995 at a
Tel Aviv peace rally. Amir is now serving life sentence for the
assassination.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot FM: Cyprus Must Be Reunified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Foreign Minister
Ioannis Kasoulides Tuesday stressed that the only settlement of
the Cyprus question is to reunify the island based on the United
Nations resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides' comments were in response to a statement by
Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz, who recently told former
Greek premier Constantinos Mitsotakis that Turkish officials have
come to the conclusion that division is the sole solution in
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus "rejects categorically any notion of accepting the fait
accompli resulting from the 1974 Turkish invasion," Kasoulides
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He also dismissed emphatically any idea of "readjusting the
so-called borders in Cyprus and any idea of part of Cyprus
joining the European Union (EU)."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus will begin the accession talks with the EU this year.
</P>
<P>
"The country's borders are its coastline and its application
for EU relates to the entire island," the Cypriot foreign minister
added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the Mediterranean
island to protect the Turkish minorities after a failed coup by
the Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Iran Slams Foreign Military Presence in Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami Tuesday lashed out at foreign military presence in the
Persian Gulf, saying regional security should be maintained by the
regional states.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to representatives of girl's schools in Tehran,
Khatami termed the presence of foreign forces in the Gulf as "an
insult to the people in the region," the Iranian official news
agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
His remark came against the backdrop that the United States and
Britain are sending more forces to the Gulf in preparation for a
military strike against Iraq over Baghdad's defiance over arms
inspection.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has barred the U.N. Special Commission in charge of
eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction from inspecting
presidential palaces suspected of hiding prohibited weapons.
</P>
<P>
Iran has said that it is opposed to military operations against
Iraq, calling for diplomatic efforts to end the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Khatami criticized the U.S. for taking "wrong and unfair"
policies towards the region and the world, saying that the
U.S. still lives in the cold war era.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed sympathy with the Iraqi people, calling on
the Iraqi leadership to comply with the U.N. Security Council
resolutions.

<HEADLINE> Israel Prepared for Iraqi Attack, PM Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that Israel has been prepared for
any possible Iraqi attack.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu told a press conference that Israel has been working
on tackling Iraqi threat either independently or with other
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said though Israel is not involved in the Iraqi crisis, he
has not know of another country as prepared to protect its people
as Israel.
</P>
<P>
"We can clearly say that in Israel there is the know-how, the
planing, the thought and preparedness on one of the highest level
in the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
The situations in the Middle East have become tense after the
United States threatened to take military actions to force Iraq to
grant free access to the arms inspectors of the United Nations in
charge of eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Israel has taken precautions, including deploying the
American-made Patriot anti-missile missile, to ward off Iraqi
retaliation for possible U.S. military strikes.
</P>
<P>
During the 1991 Gulf War, in which the U.S.-led multi-nation
forces drove the Iraqi troops out of Kuwait, Iraq fired 39 Scud
missiles at Tel Aviv in retaliation, causing heavy damage of
property.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the chief U.N. arms inspector Richard Butler said
that Iraq has sufficient biological weapons to destroy Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli officials have made efforts to calm the public.
Netanyahu's adviser David Bar-Illan has said the military
capability of Iraq at this point is not comparable to that in
1991, and the chance that Israel will be attacked is slim.
</P>
<P>
Israel's defense officials also have maintained that Iraq has a
few missiles armed with non-conventional warheads and that there
is only the slightest chance that Iraq would use them or try to
involve Israel in the crisis.

<HEADLINE> French FM Says China Can Overcome Asian Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine said Tuesday that through his visit to Beijing last month,
he is made believe that China can overcome the financial crisis
which is striking Southeast Asia and some other Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine made the remarks in an interview with the economic
daily "Les Echos" which will be published Wednesday, according
to Agence France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
"From Beijing to Hong Kong, the Chinese told me very
well-arguedly that the yuan will not be devalued, because China is
only partially integrated into the world market, because an
immense domestic market will allow them to resist, because it is
for them to show that China can be a rock in the uncertain Asian
world," he said.
</P>
<P>
He quoted Chinese officials as saying that if the Asian
economic and financial crisis had come 10 years ago, it would have
blocked the economic reform in China. If it had arrived a few
years ago, China would have been entangled into the "same spiral
as Southeast Asia."
</P>
<P>
"In the present situation, China estimates that it can resist
and that its reforms are irreversible," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait has taken
precautions to ward off possible emergency resulting from the
standoff between Iraq and the United States, the Kuwaiti News
Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti armed forces have raised its level of readiness to
face any actions that Iraq might take against Kuwait, Kuwaiti
Defense Ministry senior official Abdullah Al-Kandari told the news
agency.
</P>
<P>
Facing the tension caused by "Iraq's refusal to implement U.N.
Security Council resolutions," the Kuwaiti armed forces have been
on high alert, Al-Kandari said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has barred the United Nations Special Commission from
inspecting presidential palaces suspected of hiding secretive
weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
The commission is to certify the elimination of Iraq's nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons before the crippling economic
sanctions imposed on Iraq by U.N. Security Council seven years ago
can be lifted.
</P>
<P>
The United States has threatened to take military actions to
force Iraq to grant unrestricted access to U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has called for a peaceful solution to the crisis. But it
affirmed support to U.S. military actions against Iraq if
diplomatic efforts end in failure.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Kuwaiti Civil Defense Council has been
evaluating the current situation in the region to take necessary
measures to ensure public safety in any emergency.
</P>
<P>
And Health Minister Abdel Khaled Al-Sebeih has ordered the
medical emergency committee to review its stand-by plan.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Building Activity in High Gear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Canada's building sector was in
high gear last year, with the issued building permits hitting a
seven-year high, Statistics Canada reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 31.5 billion Canadian dollars (21.7 billion
U.S.dollars) worth of building permits was issued across the
country last year, up 20.6 percent from 1996.
</P>
<P>
Yet, it is still less than the 32.2 billion Canadian dollars in
1990 and fell well short of the record 40 billion dollars in
permits set in 1989, the statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the value of building permits for housing sector
increased 17.9 percent to 18.5 billion Canadian dollars, the
second consecutive annual increase of that magnitude.
</P>
<P>
The historically low mortgage rates, stable prices and record
activity in the resale market helped to push high the value of
building permits.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, construction intentions in the non-residential
sector rose 24.6 percent to 13.0 billion canadian dollars, the
agency said.

LONDON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook is to pay a brief visit to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait later this
week to exchange views with government leaders of the two
countries on the U.N.-Iraq crisis.
</P>
<P>
The British Foreign Office said in a statement issued Tuesday
evening that Cook will first visit Saudia Arabia before flying on
to Kuwait on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of the Foreign Secretary's visit will be to
consult key regional partners and to brief them on the U.K.'s
efforts to achieve a diplomatic solution to the Iraq crisis," Cook
said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
"Underlying Britain's approach to the present crisis is our
concern for Gulf security and our wish to ensure that (Iraqi
President)Saddam Hussein never threatens it again," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
A British government official said early Tuesday that Cook
"would like to have early personal contacts with the governments
of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait."
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of the visit would be to listen to their views,
give them our thinking about the situation and seek support for
the intense diplomacy being carried out," the official said.
</P>

Britain, the most staunch American ally in the current crisis,
has so far refused to rule out the possibility of using force

<HEADLINE> Germany: Export Credits Guarantees for Asia Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Germany will continue providing
guarantees on export credits with premiums unchanged for Southeast
Asian countries affected by financial turmoil, Economics Minister
Guenter Rexrodt announced Tuesday here.
</P>
<P>
The guarantees insure German exporters against the risk that
they will not be paid by their clients.
</P>
<P>
Rexrodt showed confidence in the Asian economies, saying there
was no reason so far to downgrade these countries, which he said
remained reliable clients.
</P>
<P>
No rise in non-payment has occurred due to the Asian crisis, he
said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Rexrodt said Germany was likely to adopt a new
premium system backed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD) in the middle of this year.
</P>
<P>
Bonn's current obligation on exports to Indonesia, Thailand,
the Philippines, Malaysia and South Korea totals 25 billion marks
(13.8 billion U.S. dollars), but the actual sum outstanding was
estimated at 17 billion marks (9.4 billion dollars) with some of
the invoices having probably been paid, it is reported.
</P>
<P>
The five countries usually claim a some 10 percent share of
Bonn's guarantees on export credits.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Sees Rising Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
expects inflation to have increased by slightly below 7 percent in
January mainly due to the lingering effects of the weak Philippine
peso on prices of basic commodities.
</P>
<P>
Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Cielito Habito said Wednesday
that no other factors are seen to drive up prices as there is
enough supply of food and oil products.
</P>
<P>
The projected inflation rate is higher than the 5 percent
recorded in January 1997 and the 5.8 percent for the entire 1997.
</P>
<P>
Despite the expected high inflation for last month, Habito said
there is no cause for worry that inflation for 1998 will zoom to
double digit.
</P>
<P>
The first quarter is seen to be a difficult time for the
economy due to the present currency crisis and economic planners
are working hard to keep inflation at the projected 7.5 to 8.5
percent, Habito said.
</P>
<P>
"To keep inflation down, monetary discipline remains crucial.
Measures to address supply bottleneck are also continuously
undertaken including those directed at El Nino-affected areas," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The government sees a zero growth for the agricultural sector
for 1998 as against 2.8-percent growth last year due to the
continuing effects of the El Nino on major crops. And this is
expected to drive up prices of food.
</P>
<P>
But Habito said a price hike spiral as a result of wage
increases is being avoided by upholding the regional mechanism for
wage determination rather than a nationally mandated minimum wage
adjustment.

<HEADLINE> India's Exports Dip Further in December Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 4 (Xinhua) -- India's export growth
continued to be sluggish in December last year with shipments from
the country declining by 5.51 percent from a year earlier in U.S.
dollar terms, an official press release said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Exports during December 1997 are valued at 2,609.69 million
U.S. dollars, which is 5.13 percent lower than the level of
2,750.85 million U.S. dollars in December 1996," the release said.
</P>
<P>
December export performance was the second worst for the
current fiscal year (April 1 1997-March 31 1998). Shipments from
the country witnessed a 10.08-percent drop in April before
registering a positive trend. The trend turned negative again in
November when exports went down by 0.95 percent.
</P>
<P>
Overall, India's exports between April and December had
increased by a meager 3.31 percent, against a 6.36-percent growth
posted during the same period of the previous year and an all-time
high of 24.47 percent in 1995-96, the release further said.
</P>
<P>
The decline in exports also sent trade deficit soaring to over
4.478 billion dollars from 3.248 billion dollars during the same
period of the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Factory Directors Removed For Quality Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Quality control inspectors now
have a bigger say in China. Forty-nine factory directors have been
removed from their posts for making poor quality goods, under
provisions of the State Bureau of Technical Supervision.
</P>
<P>
According to sources at the bureau, the qualification rate of
local products has remained at 75-to-78 percent, though the
quality of home-made goods has been stable and generally improving.
</P>
<P>
The central government has attached great importance to quality
control and has repeatedly ordered the punishment for leaders of
factories that fail twice to pass quality check-ups. A series of
laws and regulations have been issued to this effect.
</P>
<P>
With the enforcement of these laws, the bureau has stepped up
its efforts to supervise the quality of industrial products.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the director of a local explosion-proof motor factory
in north China's Shanxi Province was deprived of his title to
become the first casualty of stricter enforcement of quality
standards.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Japanese Defense Ministers Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Defense Minister
Chi Haotian and Japanese Defense Agency Director-General Fumio
Kyuma agreed on Wednesday to promote bilateral defense ties
through more exchanges between defense authorities of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached during their talks at the Japanese
Defense Agency in Tokyo, the first Sino-Japanese defense
ministerial talks since May 1987. Chi has been in Japan since
Tuesday for a six-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
Chi said that friendly relations and cooperation between China
and Japan, two close neighbors separated only by a strip of water,
are not only in their own fundamental interests but also conducive
to peace and stability in Asian-Pacific region and the world at
large.
</P>
<P>
Developing long-term, stable Sino-Japanese friendly ties is the
consistent policy of the Chinese government, Chi said.
</P>
<P>
Recalling bilateral ties since 1972 when the two countries
normalized their diplomatic relations, Chi noted that the overall
relationship between China and Japan has been good and the leaders
of the two countries have maintained close contacts and dialogues.
</P>
<P>
Touching on historical issues, Chi said that Japan adopting a
correct attitude toward historical issues will help maintain the
political foundation for Sino-Japanese ties and deepen the mutual
understanding and trust between Japan and its Asian neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the updated guidelines for Japan-U.S. defense
cooperation, Chi said that China is concerned about the guidelines
because Taiwan is involved. If Japan can show a more definite
stance on Taiwan, it will help China clear doubts about the
guidelines, Chi added.
</P>
<P>
Chi hoped that Japan will continue to go along with the road of
peaceful development.
</P>
<P>
Kyuma told Chi that Japan will abide by the China-Japan Joint
Communique and the China-Japan Treaty of Friendship and Peace and
that Japan would advance relations with China on the basis of the
two documents.
</P>
<P>
On the new guidelines for Japan-U.S. defense cooperation, Kyuma
said that the guidelines are solely bilateral and are not directed
at any third country.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Japan's basic stance has been reflected in the
China-Japan Joint Communique, Kyuma said that Japan only maintains
unofficial ties with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The two men also agreed to increase military exchanges between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Chi invited Kyuma to visit China within this year, Kyuma
accepted the invitation.

<HEADLINE> Iran Regrets Lebanese Internal Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi Wednesday expressed regret that an
internal conflict has broken out in southern Lebanon between the
Lebanese resistance forces.
</P>
<P>
"We feel very regretful at the outbreak of the conflict in
Lebanon," Mohammadi said, quoted by the Iranian official news
agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that several people, including three Lebanese
soldiers, were killed in a conflict between Lebanese factions last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The government forces are hunting down a former leader of the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, which is fighting to end Israeli occupation
of south Lebanon, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi emphasized the need for protection of stability,
tranquility and national solidarity in Lebanon to "reinvigorate
the heroic resistance of Lebanon" against Israeli forces.
</P>
<P>
"Considering the growing threats and conspiracies" of the
Israeli government," he said, "such incidents should be avoided."
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi deplored the incident took place despite several
months of mediation by Iran and local groups to prevent a conflict.
</P>
<P>
Iran will continue its mediation in cooperation with other
groups and personalities to bring the bloody internal clash to an
end, he added.

<HEADLINE> EU, US Revive Transatlantic Free Trade Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) and
the U.S. have revived plans for building a transatlantic free
trade area, said European Report published here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A decision on whether to start formal talks on the plans is
expected by April, according to the twice-weekly newsletter.
</P>
<P>
European Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan hopes that the
possible liberalization of trade flows between the two sides can
help iron out the numerous transatlantic trade disputes between
them.
</P>
<P>
Officials from both sides have been studying ways of slashing
tariff and non-tariff barriers between them, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The plans would be based on the New Transatlantic Agenda (NTA),
signed by the two sides in Madrid in December 1995, which created a
framework for cooperation on trade, security and other issues.
</P>
<P>
In the run-up to the Madrid meeting, there were suggestions
that it could launch talks on a Transatlantic Free Trade Area, or
TAFTA, but in the end the NTA only included a commitment to
studying ways of creating a "transatlantic marketplace."

<HEADLINE> Manila to Implement Labor Intensive Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
implement labor-intensive projects costing 10 billion pesos (250
million U.S. dollars) to provide jobs to laid-off workers
adversely affected by the current financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed Wednesday by Acting Labor Secretary
Cresenciano Trajano following a national employment conference on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the projects is included in the
Commitment to Action for Employment which contains short- and
long-term employment strategies to prevent layoffs, Trajano said.
</P>
<P>
More than 900 representatives attended the conference Monday to
re-study the government's employment program in the midst of the
unexpected financial crisis affecting many countries in the
Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the job-creation projects, the government will
also develop and strengthen loan mechanisms for small and
medium-sized enterprises, especially those engaged in export
business, Trajano said.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department, in particular, will take the lead in
tapping the State Insurance Fund for setting up a 200 million peso
(5 million dollars) special loan window for displaced workers.
</P>
<P>
It will recommend to the congress that the overseas employment
sector be given tax incentives to promote overseas marketing and
job generation.
</P>
<P>
The conference asked concerned government agencies to simplify
the system for the issuance of business permits to reduce waiting
time of investors and prevent the loss of investment
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department has warned of massive layoffs of domestic
workers and repatriation of Filipino workers overseas due to
economic difficulties brought about by currency crisis.

<P>
LONDON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Two fans were sent to hospital
and 29 arrested in the second English soccer match marred by
violence, police and club officials said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A female steward and a ball-girl were treated after being
attacked by fans during the F.A. Cup fourth round replay between
Reading and Cardiff at Elm Park, Reading, on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Reading won on penalties following a 1-1 draw after extra-time.

On Saturday, a linesman was knocked unconscious by a spectator
during a first division match between Portsmouth and Sheffield
United.
</P>
<P>
Reading stadium manager Ray Booth said a total of six Reading
fans were treated after being hit by coins thrown by Cardiff fans
and that two were taken to hospital.
</P>
<P>
Police said two Cardiff fans were charged with throwing
missiles.
</P>
<P>
Twelve people were still in custody on Wednesday and 17 had
been charged and released on bail. Most of those were charged with
being drunk and trying to enter a sports ground, a police
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
Violence in English soccer has been largely contained in recent
years after English clubs were banned from European competition
for five years in 1985 following the Heysel stadium tragedy.

<HEADLINE> Eastern Europe's "Bag Merchants" Returning to South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 4 (Xinhua) -- More and more "bag merchants"
from eastern Europe, mainly from Russia, are returning to the
South Korean market due to sharp devaluation of the country's won
against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
A report issued the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency
(KOTRA) said Wednesday that the so-called "bag merchants" have
started to return to South Korea recently as the won's
depreciation has resulted in cheaper goods and bigger profits for
them.
</P>
<P>
Most bag merchants are buying up daily necessities like
processed food products, clothing and footwear in Seoul's
Tongdaemun and Namdaemum markets while some have begun to buy
products such as furniture and electronic home appliance,
including refrigerators, color TVs and washing machines.
</P>
<P>
The bag merchants are mainly from the former Soviet republics.
The number from Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
KOTRA predicted that some 50,000 bag merchants will visit South
Korea this year, creating a market of 400 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The bag merchants flew into South Korea in early 1990s after
the former Soviet Union disintegrated.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Defense Chief Outlines China's Defense Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Defense Minister
Chi Haotian said here Wednesday that China, with economic
development as its priority task, pursues a defensive military
policy.
</P>
<P>
"Defending the national independence, sovereignty, unity and
security, promoting the reform and opening-up and the development
of the national economy and safeguarding peace and stability in
the neighboring region and the rest of the world constitute the
core and substance of China's national defence policy," said Chi
in a lecture given at Japan's National Institute for Defense
Studies.
</P>
<P>
China, as a developing country, would not increase the defense
budget sharply as long as no serious threat to its national
sovereignty and security arises, said Chi who arrived here Tuesday
for the first official visit by a Chinese defense chief.
</P>
<P>
China aims to build a smaller but more effective army, which
will help improve the environment for global arms control and
disarmament, build trust between countries and enable China to
concentrate on economic development, he added.
</P>
<P>
Commitment to safeguarding world peace and promoting the
progress of mankind is also a key component of China's defense
policy, said Chi, who is also vice chairman of China's Central
Military Commission.
</P>
<P>
"China will not seek hegemony, invade any other countries to
expand its territory, set up military alliance with any other
countries, or station troops or build military bases abroad," the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
China's defence building is not directed at any other countries
nor will it pose any threat to them, he stressed.

</P>
<P>
In a message on the eve of the "Kashmir Solidarity Day," Tarar
said the day marks the commitment of the entire Pakistani nation
to the just demand of the people of Kashmir for the exercise of
the right of self-determination as pledged by the United Nations
and the international community.
</P>
<P>
"It is a solemn reminder to the world at large that the
Kashmiri people continue to be denied their fundamental rights,"

Their rights must be honored and their dignity must be
respected, the president reiterated.

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects Protest over Death Verdict on German </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi Wednesday refuted Bonn's protest to Iran's death
sentence on a German national, stressing that the death verdict
should not become a political affairs between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official news agency IRNA reported that Kharrazi
expressed amazement at the stance adopted by the German
government and the country's media towards the trial of the
German citizen Helmut Hofer in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that "the simple court case should not be
transformed into a political issue and Iran-Germany relations are
in need of tranquility," adding that Iran's judicial laws allow
the defendant to appeal any possible verdicts.
</P>
<P>
Hofer, 54, a German merchant, was sentenced to death on charges
of having "forbidden sexual relations" with an Iranian Muslim
woman. A final verdict has not been issued after the case was
handed over to the Iranian higher court.
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old Iranian woman was arrested on September 21 last
year at Tehran international airport for wearing "non-Islamic
dress" and claimed to be married with Hofer after
interrogations. However, Hofer rejected the woman's claims.
</P>
<P>
Under the Islamic laws, sexual contact between a non-Muslim
man and a Muslim woman is considered as "a grave wrongdoing."
However, the Iranian woman escaped the death penalty because she
was unmarried and was sentenced to be whipped instead.
</P>
<P>
Despite his denial, Hofer was sentenced to death by an Iranian
court. The German government has launched a protest to the death
sentence on its citizen by summoning Iran's charge d'affaires in
Bonn, claiming that the verdict violated all principles of justice
and would be face harsh condemnation not only in Germany but also
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi Sunday
also stressed that the trial has been conducted by an official
court and in accordance with the independence of the Iranian
judiciary.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iran and Germany were cooled down last April
after a Berlin court accused Iranian leaders of sponsoring
assassination of four Iranian rebel Kurdish leaders in Berlin in
1992.
</P>
<P>
The Berlin court rule triggered a diplomatic row between Iran
and members of the European Union (EU), which recalled their
ambassadors from Tehran in a protest. The two sides ended their
dispute last November after the EU states agreed to return their
ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that the trial of the German national would
trigger a new roun order to convince the Iranian authorities to
withdraw the death sentence.

<HEADLINE> EC Proposes Charter on International Communications </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
European Union (EU)'s executive arm, Wednesday recommended in a
document to launch an international debate regarding global
communications policy.
</P>
<P>
The Commission also recommended in the document to set a
framework for international policy cooperation and to start a
process which could lead to the adoption of an international
communications charter.
</P>
<P>
An international charter would be a multi-lateral understanding
on a method of coordination to remove obstacles for the global
electronic marketplace, the EU executive body said in a statement
issued in Brussels Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The charter would recognize the work of existing international
organizations and promote the participation of private sector and
relevant social groups, but it would neither be legally binding
nor would it establish an international supervisory authority, the
Commission said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
It also noted that the charter could be agreed by or in the
course of 1999.

<P>
MOSCOW, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
warned U.S President Bill Clinton on Wednesday that using force to
resolve the Iraqi crisis may provoke a world war.
</P>
<P>
Clinton "might run into a world war by his actions. He is
acting too loudly. Such weapons should be handled accurately." the
ITAR-TASS quoted the Russian president as saying.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in Kremlin with regional governors, Yeltsin warned
Clinton against voicing threats to use planes and bombs against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The latest American moves were "quite unlike Clinton," he said,
stressing that Russia did not support the U.S. intention to
resolve the Iraqi crisis by means of force.
</P>
<P>
He said that Russia "would seek its own ways" and would spare
no efforts to prevent the use of force.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Yeltsin held telephone consultations with French
President Jacques Chirac and British Prime Minister Tony Blair on
ways to solve the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov also had telephone
talks with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The latest crisis over Iraq began when President Saddam Hussein
refused to allow U.N. weapons inspectors to check some 60 sites,
including about 40 presidential palaces, on ground of national
sovereignty.

<HEADLINE> 1998 Crucial Year for Macao's Handover: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, February 4 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official said
here on Wednesday that Macao has entered the crucial stage in the
preparation for a smooth handover of power.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qiren, director of the Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch,
said at a grand reception for the Chinese Lunar New Year that
there are three major tasks to be done in 1998 for a smooth
handover next year.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, a breakthrough should be made in the localization of
senior civil service, as the three major transitional issues --
the localization of civil service, the localization of law and
the use of Chinese as an official language -- should be resolved
without any delay, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Preparatory Committee for the Macao Special Administrative
Region (SAR) will be established in time and will start operation
on full scale in 1998, he added.
</P>
<P>
And thirdly, more efforts are needed in promoting economic
growth and social stability so that a smooth transition will be
maintained in Macao.
</P>
<P>
"Those three are the most urgent tasks in the final stage of
transition," he stressed. "It will be a crucial year, a year which
 demands down-to-earth efforts by all sides."
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 people, including Macao Governor Vasco Rocha
Vieira, senior government officials, leaders of local communities
and other celebrities attended the annual reception.
</P>
<P>
While stressing progress in transitional affairs over the past
year, Wang expressed the hope that Macao residents would play a
more active role and make further contribution to Macao's
transition.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that all Macao residents shall be equal before
the law, and shall be free from discrimination, irrespective of
their nationality, descent, race, sex, language, religion,
political persuasion or ideological belief, educational level,
economic status or social conditions.
</P>
<P>
"Macao will continue to be a multiple society, and different
communities should live in peace with one another," he
said. "Macao will have an even better future under the policy
of 'Macao people administering Macao' and a high degree of
autonomy."
</P>
<P>
In return, Macao Governor Vasco Rocha Vieira said in his speech
 that Portugal and China are making great efforts for the
realization of a smooth handover and the implementation of the
policy of "one country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
"The open and active dialogue between the Portuguese and
Chinese governments on Macao's current affairs and its future is
the best assurance that December 20, 1999 will not mean the end of
 a historical procedure, but the start of a road along which Macao
 will march towards development, prosperity, the establishment of
uniqueness and autonomy, and play its due strategic role within
China," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- France said Wednesday that it is
concerned about the situation in Armenia after President Levon
Ter-Petrosyan announced his resignation over Nagorno-Karabakh
problem Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are following with great attention the situation in Armenia,
a country with which we have privileged relations," said French
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
Petrosyan reportedly disagreed over Nagorno-Karabakh with Prime
Minister Robert Kocharyan, who was former president of the
self-declared "Republic of Nagorny Karabakh," a sub-state which
has claimed independence from Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
Petrosyan accepted a peace plan elaborated by France, Russia
and the United States for re-establishing confidence among the
conflicting sides of Nagorno-Karabakh before deciding the final
status of the area.
</P>
<P>
"It is important for us that the peace aimed at finding a
definitive and just solution to Nagorny Karabakh should not be
interrupted," said the French spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
She expressed the hope that a new government of Armenia will
"adopt the same positive attitude toward international mediation to
the benefit of all parties and the whole region," she said.
</P>
<P>
Under the country's constitution, Armenia will hold a
presidential election within 40 days following its president's
resignation.

<HEADLINE> Fossils of Earliest Multicellular Animals Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Fossils of multicellular
animals dating back 580 million years have been discovered in
southwestern China, a leading Chinese scientist announced here
today.
</P>
<P>
These are believed to be the earliest multicellular animals
living on Earth and are more than 20 million years earlier than
Ediacaran biota found in Australia which had been regarded as the
earliest such animal, said Chen Junyuan, professor with the
Nanjing Institute of Geology and Paleontology under the Chinese
Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The discovery could lead to significant breakthroughs in
exploring the evolution of early life on the globe, experts say.
</P>
<P>
Professor Chen discovered the fossils in August and September
last year in Weng'an County of Guizhou Province with Li C.-W., a
professor with the National Tsinghua University of Taiwan, hence
naming them "Weng'an fossils".
</P>
<P>
The fossil fauna include large quantities of tiny multicellular
animals and their embryos, which proved to be the earliest
multicellular animals after the late pre-Cambrian period when
ground temperatures rose, land glaciers melted and sea levels rose.
</P>
<P>
Research shows that the animals existed more than 50 million
years earlier than the fossils of animals during the Cambrian
explosion found in Chengjiang County of southwest China's Yunnan
Province.
</P>
<P>
What's more important, Chen said, is that the fossils are
perfectly preserved. It is discernible that the sponges, only 0.5
to 0.75 millimeters, consist of cells of different types. "It's
amazing that the cellular pattern of such animals resembles that
of modern sponges," he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, many fossils of the sponges' embryos and larvae
have been found.
</P>
<P>
Sponges were the most primitive species among multicellular
animals. Before the Weng'an discovery, scientists studying
multicellular animals before the Cambrian explosion had to rely on
controversial fossils.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Defense Minister Calls for New Security Concept </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Defense Minister Chi
Haotian on Wednesday called for the establishment of a new
security concept to seek a lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a lecture to Japan's National Institute for Defense
Studies, the visiting Chinese defense minister said that the
security system based upon military alliance and military build-up
during the Cold War period approved to be unable to build peace.
</P>
<P>
Neither expanding military blocs nor strengthening military
alliance would be conducive to world security, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Security should rely on mutual trust and the links of common
interests," Chi said.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister then outlined three aspects of the new
security concept.
</P>
<P>
He said that first of all, the state-to-state relations should
be based on the five principles of mutual respect for sovereignty
and territory integrity, none aggression, none interference of
each others' internal affairs, equality and mutual benefits, and
peaceful co-existence.
</P>
<P>
And then countries should seek common prosperity by enhancing
economic cooperation, opening up markets to each other and
eliminating unequal and discriminatory policies in economic and
trade fields, he said.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, countries should enhance mutual trust and
understanding through dialogue and cooperation and promise to
solve disputes and conflicts by peaceful means, he said,
</P>
<P>
Chi said security dialogues should be aimed at enhancing trust
instead of confrontation and should not endanger other countries'
security interests.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister emphasized that China does not pose a
military threat to the neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
"In the past several years, some people in the world are
preaching "China threat" for ulterior motives," he said. "They are
trying to diplomatically alienate China from its neighboring
countries, to damage China's international image and hold up
China's development."
</P>
<P>
"Even if China becomes more developed and stronger, it will
never be a threat to any country in the world," Chi
said. "Instead, China will contribute to all mankind as a key
force to defend global peace and stability."
</P>
<P>
Chi arrived in Tokyo on Tuesday for a six-day visit, the first
official visit to Japan by a Chinese defense minister.

<HEADLINE> New Funding System Helps More People to Buy Own Homes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Public Housing Fund, a new
funding system developed in recent years in Shanghai, has enabled
an increasing number of local residents to purchase their own
apartments.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, some 83,000 urban families in Shanghai have bought
their residential homes with 4.6 billion yuan in loans from the
fund.
</P>
<P>
More than 600,000 workers have purchased the property rights to
their homes which used to belong to the State.
</P>
<P>
The system was adopted in 1991. Since then, more than 95
percent of work units and their staff members have joined the
fund. So far, the city has collected 16.27 billion yuan for the
fund, which accounts for 20 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Employees whose work units have joined the fund now pay 6
percent of their wage to the fund and are able to get soft loans
in return.
</P>
<P>
The new system has also encouraged local banks to provide
mortgage loans for individuals. The Shanghai Branch of the China
Construction Bank alone granted local residents 3 billion yuan in
mortgage loans.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the city's management center of the Public
Housing Fund told Xinhua that in 1998 the fund is expected to
raise 5.8 billion yuan and to offer 5 billion yuan in mortgage
loans for local individual home buyers.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Automotive Industry Enters New Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 4 (Xinhua) -- After a decade of development,
the auto industry in Shanghai has entered a new period of
technological progress, a municipal government official told
Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
Yu Guosheng, deputy director of the Municipal Economic
Commission, said that by the early years of the 21st century the
local automotive industry should be able to develop its own
products.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1960s, Shanghai first produced cars by imitating
Mercedes Benz products; in the early '80s, the city began to
manufacture Santana cars by cooperating with Germany's Volkswagen;
in the '90s, Shanghai Volkswagen developed the Santana 2000 cars
through a joint design with Volkswagen's overseas firms in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Shanghai has become the largest automotive
manufacturer in China. In 1997 the city turned out 230,000 Santana
cars with a 92 percent localization rate, which means that the
parts are made in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
According to Yu, Shanghai is now working with General Motors of
the United States to build the country's largest automotive
project. Once the project is completed, the city's car-making
capacity is expected to top 400,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's automotive industry, one of the six pillar
industries for the city, has broad prospects with the support from
both central and local governments, Yu said.

<HEADLINE> Wolfensohn: World Bank Focuses on Crisis' Impact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Visiting World Bank President
James D. Wolfensohn said here Wednesday that the bank is focusing
its attention on efforts to manage the social impact of the
prolonged monetary crisis in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"One goal of the presence of the World Bank (here) is to assist
the government in overcoming the social impact of the prolonged
and ongoing economic crisis," Wolfensohn said during a discussion
with 70 public figures, including economists and non-governmental
organization activists. "There will be no stability and peace if
the people are not fed. There will also be no confidence to
restore the economy."
</P>
<P>
Social protection is badly needed to cushion the impact of the
crisis, he said, adding that preventing panic over food is an
important effort.
</P>
<P>
"Thus, the World Bank has provided assistance for a social
program which will be carried out soon," he said.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund has committed a 40 billion U.S.
dollar bailout package for Indonesia, some 4.5 billion dollars of
which will come from the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The bank will release 2 billion dollars this year, to be used
for a program that will protect the poor against the impact of the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn also said the bank wants to help in structural
reforms, especially in terms of banking supervision.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank chief, who arrived here Tuesday evening from
Kuala Lumpur for a three-day visit as part of a seven-day tour of
Southeast Asian countries, noted that the discussion aimed to seek
inputs from the Indonesians themselves on how to bail the country
out of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn will meet with Indonesian President Soeharto this
evening to discuss the monetary crisis in the country.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning Reports Comprehensive Rural Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning Province, a major
agricultural base in northeast China, recorded good agricultural
harvests in 1997 despite severe droughts in many areas.
</P>
<P>
The province harvested some 13 million tons of grain in 1997,
with its total output non-stable foodstuffs such as vegetables,
meat, eggs, milk and aquatic products exceeding 20 million
tons. The annual per capita income of farmers hit 2,350 yuan,
according to a local agriculture official.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the good harvest to large scale irrigation
projects and reinstatement of the land contract system for farming
households.
</P>
<P>
Severe drought conditions affected more than 1.3 million ha
during 1997. The provincial government responded to the crisis by
allocating 200 million yuan to dig 10,000 wells to irrigate 46,600
hectares of land.
</P>
<P>
Rural industrial firms placed priority on the development of
agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning maintained strong comprehensive development despite the
fact that acreage sown to grain crops fell by three percent on the
1990 level. The output value of forestry, animal husbandry,
side-line products and fisheries sectors currently accounts for 50
percent of Liaoning's total agricultural output value.

<P>
MACAO, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Land Fund of the Macao
Special Administrative Region (SAR) has come to almost 8 billion
patacas (about 1 billion U.S. dollars), the Macao Daily News
reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Yang Runzhen, chief of the Chinese side of the Sino-Portuguese
Land Group, told the newspaper that the fund would reach 10
billion patacas (about 1.25 billion dollars) by 1999 if the Macao
government collected the debt developers owe to it promptly.
</P>
<P>
Yang noted that the Chinese side has taken extra care in the
investment of the fund and the investment has not been affected by
the Asian currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
The fund is of vital importance to the future Macao SAR
government since no treasury reserve has been established so far,
she stressed.
</P>
<P>
Set up 10 years ago, the Sino-Portuguese Land Group handles
Macao's land contracts and related affairs on behalf of the
governments of China and Portugal. Its mission will wind up by

<HEADLINE> HK Banks Enjoy Healthy Profit Growth in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's banking sector
enjoyed healthy profit growth in 1997 but faces a tougher year in
1998, acting chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority
(HKMA) David Carse said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The driving forces behind the satisfactory performance last
year were "strong volume growth in domestic lending and generally
good asset quality," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, profits were affected by the narrowing of margins in
the second half of 1997, particularly following the rise in the
Hong Kong Inter-bank Offered Rate from October, he said.
</P>
<P>
While predicting 1998 to be a "tougher year", Carse also
stressed: "Banks have budgeted for reasonable profits in 1998 and
all the banks are expected to make money."
</P>
<P>
Although bad debts are expected to rise this year, there are a
number of mitigating factors -- banks are starting 1998 with good
asset quality, bad debt provisions remain relatively low, banks
are not over-exposed to regional economies, and the quality of
bank management in Hong Kong is good, he said.
</P>
<P>
Loans overdue for more than three months and rescheduled
amounted to 20.2 billion HK dollars (2.6 billion U.S. dollars) at
the September of 1997, occupying a relatively low level of 1.83
percent of total loans.
</P>
<P>
The HKMA will take measures to avoid undue property
concentration, he added. Property exposures at the end of December
1997 took account of 44.2 percent of loans for use in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Banks whose exposure is above the industry average of about 40
percent should stabilize or reduce that percentage, however, it is
unrealistic to expect all banks to get down to 40 percent in the
short term," Carse noted.
</P>
<P>
"Local banks have adopted a more cautious attitude toward
property lending" since the regional financial turmoil hit Hong
Kong in October, he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides monitoring property exposures, the HKMA will continue
to promote sound fundamentals in local banks in 1998: capital
adequacy, liquidity, loan to deposit ratio and sound risk
management, Carse said.

<HEADLINE> Nepali King Calls Special Parliament Session, Ending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The political uncertainty in
Nepal ended Wednesday as King Birendra finally chose to accept the
submission by 96 MPs to convene a special session of parliament on
February 11 to discuss their no-confidence motion against the
present government.
</P>
<P>
King Birendra decided to call the special session after taking
the Supreme Court's advice, though it is not a binding one.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa, who came to power last
October, now faces the censure motion, as his recommendation to
dissolve parliament and hold mid-term elections was turned down by
the King.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of crisis in the Himalayan kingdom is
political as well as constitutional.
</P>
<P>
The crisis emerged on January 8 when Prime Minister Thapa
recommended the King to dissolve parliament for fresh polls to
forestall the move by 96 MPs from the opposition Communist Party
of Nepal (United Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML) and his own National
Democratic Party (RPP) to file a censure motion against his
coalition government.
</P>
<P>
The country has witnessed four coalition governments since the
mid-term polls in late 1994. Thapa is just another victim of
coalition politics, and if anything, he is the most short-lived
one to face a censure motion.
</P>
<P>
For King Birendra, the headache is that the two recommendations
are both constitutional, and that the Supreme Court had previously
handed down two conflicting verdicts, making it really hard for
him to make a choice.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the court ruled that Prime Minister Girija Prasad
Koirala of the Nepali Congress (NC) was within his constitutional
authority to recommend dissolution of parliament for fresh polls.
</P>
<P>
But the following year it overturned the similar recommendation
made to the king by Prime Minister Man Mohan Adhikari of the
CPN-UML, ruling that dissolution was not allowed if an alternative
government could be formed from the existing parliament.
</P>
<P>
After days of consultations with advisors, legal experts and
party leaders, King Birendra still could not make a decision. He
referred the matter to the apex court on January 13.
</P>
<P>
But the King's move drew criticism as well. Some argued that
the King must consult with the prime minister before acting upon
anything except matters specifically reserved to his discretion.
The ruling NC and RPP both hit at the King's move.
</P>
<P>
During the week-long discussions held at the Supreme Court
beginning on January 19, party representatives and legal experts
stuck to their own arguments. The focus was on whether the prime
minister's recommendation should enjoy priority over that of the
MPs.
</P>
<P>
Though Prime Minister Thapa's recommendation gained the upper
hand in the discussions, the final say lies in the nine judges of
the court's special bench.
</P>
<P>
Six of them including the chief justice favored a special
session of parliament, while the other three voted for dissolution
of parliament for fresh polls.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the apex court's opinion would clear
confusion over the interpretation of some articles of the
constitution and set a guideline for future political practices.
</P>
<P>
Now the country's attention shifts to the upcoming session of
the Lower House. No one can predict exactly the fate of the
present government, yet it is safe to say that horse-trading, as
usual, will work its way right before the session opens.

JAKARTA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's inflation rate in
January reached 6.88 percent, raising the average from April 1997
to January 1998 to 15.97 percent, or tripling the 4.24 percent
recorded over the same period in the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
This was largely due to the rise in prices for clothing, food,
goods and services as well as for housing, Information Minister
Hartono said here Wednesday after a limited cabinet meeting
chaired by President Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Industry and Trade Minister Tunky Ariwibowo said the
country's trade in November last year registered a 1.4 billion
U.S. dollar surplus, with 720 million dollars coming from
non-oil/gas commodities.
</P>
<P>
"For the past five years, there has been no surplus in the
trade of non-oil/gas commodities higher than 700 million U.S.
dollars. Only last November (did we get such a surplus)," the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
He noted however that oil/gas imports decreased from 468
million dollars in November 1996 to 243 million dollars in
November 1997 while total imports fell from 3.6 billion dollars to
3.2 billion dollars.

province, and the road linking Tangshan with Tianjin and Jingtang
Harbor have opened to traffic.
</P>
<P>
Construction of expressways between Beijing and Shenyang and
between Baoding and Tianjin is in full swing.
</P>
<P>
Eight newly built berths at the Jingtang Harbor are
operational, bringing the harbor's annual handling capacity to 5
million tons.
</P>
<P>
The fourth-phase construction of a coal project at the
Qinhuangdao Port has been completed, making it the largest coal
transit center in China.
</P>
<P>
Expansion projects at the Shijiazhuang Airport made it possible
to open new routes to Hong Kong and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Telephone switchboards across the province have been expanded
by 720,000 lines, bringing the telephone exchange capacity in
Hebei to 5.1 million, seventh in the country.
</P>
<P>
New generating units have been installed in six power plants
with an additional installed capacity of 1.34 million kilowatts.

CAIRO, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
said Wednesday Egypt will not join any potential military action
against Iraq if diplomacy fails to resolve the escalating
Iraq-U.N. showdown, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt is not ready to participate in a military action with
the U.S.. We do not have an aircraft carrier or any other
weapons," Mubarak told reporters during inauguration of Egypt's
second nuclear research reactor in Inshas, north of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president called upon Baghdad to comply with the
United Nations resolutions to avert a "very dangerous" situation.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Egypt will approve a military strike against Iraq,
Mubarak said: "We call upon the Iraqis to implement Security
Council resolutions because this is very important. Otherwise the
situation will be dangerous."
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has dispatched Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdul-Meguid to Baghdad to meet with Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein in a bid to defuse the crisis over its rejection of the
U.S. demand for unrestricted access for the U.N. weapons
inspectors to the sites where biological and chemical weapon
materials are suspected to be hidden.
</P>

In view of the current situation, Mubarak said Egypt is

leaders.

<HEADLINE> Teenagers Report on Salt-Melted Snow's Environmental Impact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Two teen-age Beijing
schoolgirls have studied the effects of salt-melted snow on the
environment, offering scientific evidence for an environmental
protection regulation promulgated by the municipal government this
winter.
</P>
<P>
Clearing away the snow on the streets has been a headache for
the environmental department after every snowfall. To avoid
traffic accidents, they usually spray salt water on the streets to
speed up the melting process.
</P>
<P>
According to an official from the environmental department,
Beijing sprayed water containing about 600 tons of salt on the
city's main streets and highways after a heavy snowfall in
mid-January. Chemical examination showed that the content of salt
in the snow in some areas was about 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Xiao Nan and Yang Jingjing, two schoolgirls in Beijing No.13
Middle School, found that street cleaners put the salt-melted snow
underneath the trees along the streets, and expressed concerns
about the possible adverse effects on the trees.
</P>
<P>
The two girls collected soil samples under the trees along the
streets, and compared the samples with the soil in their
school. Their test showed that the content of salt in the soil
samples from the streets was much higher.
</P>
<P>
They also carried out an experiment, giving evidence that the
soil with a high salt content destroys plants cells, erodes the
roots and causes the leaves to wither.
</P>
<P>
After a year's investigation, the two girls presented their
report to the environmental protection department with a warning
that salt-melted snow is the main cause of increased salt in the
soil.
</P>
<P>
Related departments issued a regulation this winter forbidding
the piling up of salt-melted snow under the trees and in lawns.

SEOUL, February 4 (Xinhua) -- A total of 1,748 South Koreans

</P>
<P>
The figure showed the highest-ever application rate since the
nation began its unemployment insurance system in July, 1995.
</P>
<P>
With the employment situation worsening, statistics issued

benefits every day last month.
</P>
<P>
The nation's labor force market is also heading towards
instability with supply well outstripping demand.
</P>
<P>
A new trend has surfaced in the country's labor market, every
100 job seekers, including laid-off collars, are competing for 77
jobs in 3D (dirty, difficulty and dangerous) sectors, which was
specially left for foreigners.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, one of "the Four Dragons in Asia," has been in
serious financial troubles caused by corporate failures and bad
loans of financial institutions since late 1997.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed with the International Monetary Fund
last December for rescue loans of 57 billion U.S. dollars, the

<HEADLINE> Manila Pledges Earlier Recovery of Crash Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
use all available resources to facilitate the earliest recovery of
the bodies of passengers and crew aboard the ill-fated Cebu
Pacific plane that crashed Monday in Mindanao, an official said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The DC-9 passenger plane carrying 104 people, including five
crew members, went missing Monday after it left Manila for the
southern city of Cagayan de Oro. The Philippine Air Force spotted
Tuesday afternoon the possible wreckage site off the northeastern
slope of Mt. Sumagaya in Misamis Oriental, Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Josefina T. Lichauco, transportation and communication
secretary, told reporters here that the government will do its
best for the earlier recovery of the victims of the air disaster.
</P>
<P>
Lichauco also dismissed Tuesday's press reports about 15
survivors as inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
He said that when such reports came out, rescuers from the army
and the Air Transport Office of his department had not been able
to reach the site due to gusty winds.
</P>
<P>
The local press, citing local officials and police, said
Tuesday that rescuers had found 15 survivors and 30 dead bodies in
Mt. Sumagaya.
</P>
<P>
As of 11:30 Wednesday, Luchauco said, the ground rescue team
who left Tuesday were still six kilometers from the site. Rain
showers and strong gusty winds are making even the establishment
of a landing site difficult.
</P>
<P>
He said a number of pictures taken by the air force could
hardly show any substantial portion of the plane wreckage leading
to a tentative conclusion that an explosion could have happened.
</P>
<P>
But earlier in the day, rescuers found debris of the plane
spreading in areas around Mt. Sumagaya, including calling cards of
passengers, documents and a curtain of the plane.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Ambassador: Albright Brings Nothing to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright made no contribution to the Mideast peace process in her
recent regional tour, Palestinian Ambassador to Egypt Zohdi al
Kodra said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"She has brought nothing new to the Middle East peace process
and the Palestinian-Israeli differences were not resolved," al
Kodra told reporters at Arish Airport, 360 kilometers northeast of
Cairo, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after seeing off Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat, who was leaving for Spain
and the Netherlands to discuss Europe's role in the Middle East
and financial assistance to the PNA, the MENA said.
</P>
<P>
Al Kodra said Arafat and Albright discussed specific ideas and
American proposals about the peace talks between the Palestinians
and the Israelis when she visited the Palestinian self-rule areas
last week.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinian side rejected the American proposals
because they ran counter to the Palestinian-Israeli agreements, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the U.S. proposed a step-by-step Israeli troop
pullback in the West Bank in parallel with the Palestinian
fulfillment of Israel's security demands.
</P>
<P>
"The American proposals only express the American and Israeli
viewpoints without lending any consideration to the Palestinian
side," the Palestinian Ambassador complained.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli talks have been stalled since last
March when Israel started a Jewish settlement in Arab East
Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want as the capital of their
future independent state.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Close Firmer Despite Weaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Australian shares closed
slightly firmer Wednesday despite a weaker resource sector, as
industrial stocks followed Wall Street higher.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries gained 2.5 points, or 0.9 percent, to
2,656.9 after the U.S. blue chip index, the Dow Jones industrial
average, finished 52.57 higher at 8,160.35.
</P>
<P>
A broker from a domestic firm said the market had been calm, if
not quiet.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody has been too fussed about the Asian
markets today," he said.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index fell 3.7 points, or 0.31 percent, to
1,182.1 while the all industrials index was up 9.3 points, or 0.21
percent, to 4,513.0.
BDH182WSW002S04PEQL19:5119:532596
</P>
<P>
The gains in the industrial sector were led by a sharp rise in
Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, whose stocks were lifted 31 cents to
9.02 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Banking stocks closed weaker, retracing some of their
spectacular gains in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
National Australia Bank fell 15 cents, ANZ fell six,
Commonwealth Bank finished down seven and Westpac fell 0.3 cents.
</P>
<P>
But it was St George Bank shares which grabbed the attention of
brokers Wednesday, as commentators speculated that National
Australia Bank wants to sell its near six percent stake.
</P>
<P>
St George shares closed down 23 cents on relatively light
turnover of 792,385 shares.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, gold plunged through 300 U.S. dollars an ounce
overnight to open in Sydney at 295.35 an ounce. It closed here at
296.75. Brokers said that the precious metal had not had the
fundamental support for its recent push up through the crucial
300-mark.
</P>
<P>
Despite a rise in the price of base metals, mining giant BHP
fell three cents, Rio Tinto also lost three and WMC gained eight.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was 261.03 million Shares, valued at 754.76
million Australian dollars (513.23 million US dollars) with falls
outnumbering rises 593 to 504.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Weaker on Retail Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar weakened
Wednesday while the domestic bond market rallied following the
release of weaker-than-expected retail sales figures.
</P>
<P>
The local currency closed at 67.92 US cents, well down from
68.62 locally late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It began the day half a U.S. cent weaker, dragged down by an
overnight slump in the price of gold.
</P>
<P>
In the U.S., COMEX gold for current delivery closed at 295.80
US dollars per ounce, down 7.60 from the previous close.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was then sold off further after the
Australian Bureau of Statistics announced that retail turnover
fell 0.8 percent, seasonally adjusted, to 11.143 billion
Australian dollars (7.577 billion US dollars) in December.
</P>
<P>
Following reports of bumper Christmas sales, an increase of 1.0
percent in retail trade had been widely expected.
</P>
<P>
"The market was stunned by the weakness in retail trade for
December, given the unequivocally strong anecdotal evidence,"
Societe Generale chief economist Glenn Maguire said.
</P>
<P>
"The market consensus had been that consumers were cashed up
and spending strongly in the pre-Christmas period," he said.
</P>
<P>
St George Bank foreign exchange trading manager Stuart Moore
said the Australian dollar fell to 67.80 US cents on the news.
</P>
<P>
However, buying by US names kept that level supported, and the
Australian dollar bounced back to 68.10 during the session.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished the session at 85.23 yen, down
from 86.50 here Tuesday, and at 1.2338 marks down from 1.2459.

<HEADLINE> China Adopts Measures to Protect Loulan Site in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, February 4 (Xinhua) -- China has introduced a series of
measures to protect Loulan, an ancient city which prospered on the
legendary "Silk Road" over 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
A cement stele bearing the words "a major historical and
cultural site under state protection" and a brief introduction of
the city was recently erected at the Loulan site in the Lop Nur
region in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
"We delimited the protected area and anyone illegally entering
the area or damaging the ancient site will be severely punished,"
according to Yue Feng, director of the Xinjiang Cultural Relics
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Loulan, one of the busiest commercial cities on the ancient
"Silk Road", served as a transportation hub for the flow of goods
from China to the western world. Shifting desert sand mysteriously
buried the city in the fourth century.
</P>
<P>
A Swedish archeologist discovered the ruins located close to
Lop Nur Lake in 1900. Thereafter, adventurers from Europe and
Japan flocked to the site and pilfered numerous cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
The Lop Nur Region was designated as China's nuclear testing
center in the 1960s, and unauthorized individuals were banned from
entering the area. The Chinese government agreed to the moratorium
on nuclear testing in 1996 and adventurers were once again allowed
to enter the area.
</P>
<P>
Yue noted that archeologists have scoured the Loulan site and
delimited a protected area covering some 30 square kilometers. A
centrally located Buddhist pagoda serves as the Loulan symbol.
</P>
<P>
"We've drafted a plan to renovate the ancient site and are
currently awaiting final approval from the State Bureau of
Cultural Relics," said Yue, adding that "the bureau has already
allocated 400,000 yuan (about 48,000 US dollars) to support the
project which will be completed at a total cost of dozens of
million yuan."

<HEADLINE> Research Nuclear Reactor Inaugurated in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
and his Argentine counterpart Carlos Menem inaugurated Egypt's
second research nuclear reactor that was built in cooperation with
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the new nuclear reactor in Inshass on the
northeastern skirts of Cairo is the focus of the one-day visit of
the Argentine president who arrived here this morning.
</P>
<P>
The 22-megawatt reactor has medical, industrial and
agricultural applications.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak delivered a speech at the inauguration in which he
lauded the Egyptian-Argentine cooperation in scientific and
technological domains as "an example of fruitful south-south
cooperation."
</P>
<P>
He reviewed Egypt's efforts in peaceful usage of nuclear
technology, emphasizing that Egypt exposes all its installations
to international surveillance.
</P>
<P>
Presidents Mubarak and Menem will hold a session of talks later
in the day on bilateral relations and issues of mutual concern,
including the Iraqi crisis over U.N. weapons inspection.
</P>
<P>
Accompanying Menem is Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella, who was
quoted by Argentine media on Sunday as saying Argentina was ready
to join any military action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
During the president's short stay in Cairo, the two sides will
sign a number of cooperation agreements in the technical and
scientific, security fields, as well two private sector
agreements.

<P>
A two-ton stele, which stands 1.8 meters in height and has a
width of one meter, stands beside the east gate leading to the
ancient city. Craftsmen erected the structure with the front side
facing east in order to protect it from strong northwesterly winds.
</P>
<P>
"The stele should have been built in 1982 when the site was
designated as a major historical and cultural site under state
protection," Yue said. "However, the work was delayed due to the
fact the site is surrounded by wastelands and desert," he added.
</P>
<P>
A team of twelve people, led by Yue, crossed a 300 km. stretch
of wastelands in six days to transport the stele to the site.
</P>
<P>
"Erecting the stele was a necessity," said Yue, adding that, "a
permanent symbol clearly delimiting the protected area will help
prevent illegal entries."
</P>
<P>
Several hundred geologists are currently exploring the Lop Nur
Region for oil and sylvite. Yue stressed that cultural relics
protection should be strictly enforced for all related
construction projects.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the increasing number of visitors to the
region has resulted in damage to come cultural relics. Yue's team
has removed over 300 kg of beverage containers and food boxes
discarded by people entering the area illegally. Yue said the team
burned some trash and buried the remainder some 30 km away from
the ancient site.
</P>
<P>
"Loulan has emerged as a hot topic in research related to the
Silk Road," Yue said, adding that "Protecting the site will
guarantee the success of ensuing archeological research."

General Ahmed Esmat Abdel-Meguid arrived here Wednesday en route
to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
He is on a mission trying to mediate a peaceful solution to the

</P>
<P>
He was referring to the U.S. threat of military actions to
force Iraq to grant the UNSCOM free access to any inspection sites.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid is scheduled to leave for Baghdad later in the

WELLINGTON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The visiting World Cup

Midway through the second half, Chile's striker Rodrigo Barrera

judged offside.

Minutes later New Zealand conceded a freekick from 20 meters
out and a well-struck shot over the defensive wall by substitute
Jose Luis Sierra beat All Whites goalkeeper Jason Batty but hit
the bar.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand, who have only qualified once for the World Cup
back in 1982, might even have taken a shock lead in the seventh
minute. But a crisp downward header from Danny Hay was just tipped
around the post by goalkeeper Marcelo Ramirez.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, DPRK Sign Investment Guarantee Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) signed here Wednesday
an agreement on investment guarantee.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed by Secretary General Asmat Kamaluddin of
the Malaysian Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)
and DPRK Ambassador to Malaysia Kim Jin Ok, provides the framework
for further expanding the flow of investments and business
activities between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Investments made by citizens of the two countries shall receive
treatment which is fair and equitable and not less favorable than
that accorded to those made by people of any third state, an MITI
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will protect investment by investors of both
countries made prior to as well as after the signing of the
agreement, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The accord provides certainties and addresses the concerns of
investors on matters pertaining to expropriation and
nationalization and repatriation of profits in terms of free
transfer of income accruing to investments.
</P>
<P>
It also provides for the settlement of investment disputes
through relevant international organizations such as the
International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes.
</P>
<P>
So far, there has been no Malaysian investment in the DPRK and
vice versa.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade between the two countries between January and
November 1997 amounted to 9.4 million ringgit (about 2.35 million
U.S. dollars), compared with 14.4 million ringgit (about 3.6
million dollars at the present rate) a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Angola Detains Another S. African Cargo Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- One more plane was detained
Tuesday at Luanda International Airport for transporting cargo
for the former rebel movement -- the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
The "Antonov-26" transport plane, according to a report by
Angola News Agency Wednesday, belongs to Ukraine. It took off in
South Africa for Luanda with five Ukraine crew on board and two
South African passengers.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the detainment, said the report, is that it had
flown into the UNITA-occupied regions many times, transporting
cargoes for UNITA. For this the plane numbered "UR-260160" has
been put on the list of violating Angola's territorial space by
U.N observers in Angola.
</P>
<P>
But Victor Ferreira, an Angolan civil Aviation Bureau
official was quoted as saying that the Ukrainian plane got the
green light from his bureau, and the reason for its Detention was
to probe its past records of transporting cargoes for UNITA.
</P>
<P>
The plane, in service of South Africa's "SG Corporation", is
said to be carrying cargoes for Jamaca Civil Construction Company
Ltd in Angola.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time Angola detained a foreign plane. On
January 20, a South African DC-4 plane was forced to land by
Angolan airforce jets when it intruded into Angola's air space to
carry building materials for UNITA. Three crew and five
passengers aboard were detained.

<HEADLINE> 25 Million Pak Children to Be Immunized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan will launch the
second round of the World Health Organization-sponsored polio day
campaign on February 9 to immunize more than 25 million children
all over the country against the crippling disease.
</P>
<P>
This is the fifth year of large-scale polio vaccination
campaign launched by the Pakistani government.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, there were 1,800 cases of polio in Pakistan. But two
years after the anti-polio vaccination campaign, the polio cases
were reduced to about 36, officials from the Health Ministry said
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The government plans to get at least 25 million children
immunized during the second round of the polio day campaign.
</P>
<P>
Only 56 percent of the children in selected districts have
completed their routine immunization series. This means that many
children need to be immunized against polio, said officials for
the polio eradication program.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government has been campaigning for the
immunization on radio and television besides observing special
days for the polio vaccination program to create awareness among
the people.
</P>
<P>
According to the District Health Office of Islamabad, a total
of 400 special polio centers in the 12 union councils of Islamabad
will administer oral polio vaccination on February 9.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Delegation Arrives for Nagano Winter Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese sports delegation for
the 18th Olympic Winter Games arrived here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese contingent, which was composed of 61 skaters and
skiiers, will take part in seven sports of speed skating, short-track
speed skating, figure skating, women's ice hockey, free style skiing,
cross country skiing and women's biathlon.
</P>
<P>
It is the sixth time that China take part in the Winter Olympics
since 1980, when Chinese athletes made their debut in Lake Placid, the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Xu Yinsheng, Chief-de-Mission of the Chinese delegation, would not
put his eyes on any gold medal this time. "We do not have any big
chances to win a gold medal at in Winter Olympics although we have a
desire to make a breakthrough in the last Winter Olympics of this
century," he said upon arrival.
</P>
<P>
"We would take this opportunity to learn from our rivals," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Among the 61 Chinese Olympians, 10 took part in the last Olympics
in Lillehammer, Norway four years ago when China picked up one silver
and two bronzes.
</P>
<P>
Chinese figure skater Chen Lu, bronze medalist in the women's
singles event last time, is the only medal winner who returns to the
ice rink this time.
</P>
<P>
But it would be difficult for Chen to find back her form in Nagano.
At the 1997 World Championships, she only finished 25th and had to win
an Olympic spot through qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
China would pin its medal hope on women's short track speed skating
and free style skiing. At the 1997 World Championships, Yang Yang
from Jilin Province in northeast China, collected titles in the
women's 500m, 1,000m and al-around events and Guo Dandan claimed the
first world title in the World Free Style Skiing Championships in
August last year.
</P>
<P>
"I will try to ski to my best and win a medal here in Nagano, " Guo
Dandan said.

<HEADLINE> Australian PM Accuses US of "Avarice" in Asia Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard Wednesday warned of a possible trade war with the United
States, accusing Washington of using the Asian financial crisis to
try to steal Australian export markets.
</P>
<P>
Howard made the charge as he announced federal assistance for
Australian exports to Indonesia to counter what he called
"avaricious competition" from the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Howard also said Australia was considering other steps to
protest against U.S. attempts to take advantage of the economic
upheaval in Asia to push the interests of their exporters.
</P>
<P>
"Our exporters are facing fierce, even on occasion actively
avaricious competition from United States exporters into
Indonesia, who are not being shy in the export methods being
employed in order to gain access to the Indonesian market," Howard
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He hinted that Australia was considering taking the U.S. to the
World Trade Organization (WTO), saying: "We're gathering material
about what is happening, let me put it that way."
</P>
<P>
The assistance Howard announced Wednesday will take the form of
short-term credit insurance through Australia's Export Finance and
Insurance Corporation (EFIC).
</P>
<P>
No figure has yet been put on the Indonesian package, which
will be made on a case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
Both Howard and Primary Industries Minister John Anderson have
criticized the U.S. for offering cash-strapped nations billion
dollar credit guarantees to bolster its exports.
</P>
<P>
However, a senior U.S. government official in Canberra for a
commodities conference Wednesday rejected the accusation by
Australia and played down the risk of a trade war with Australia.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agency Administrator
Susan Offutt said export guarantees, in which the government picks
up the tab for defaulted export payments, were a necessary tool.
</P>
<P>
"In our view the use of exports credit essentially introduces
stability into our market share at a time of financial
instability," Offutt told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"In any event we expect Australian exports of beef into the
region to expand at our expense because of the (Australian dollar)
currency devaluation."

<HEADLINE> S. Lanka Marks Golden Jubilee Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka held a grand ceremony
in front of the parliamentary complex in the suburbs of Colombo
Wednesday to mark the 50th Independence Day of the country amid
tight security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga, Prime Minister
Sirimavo Bandaranaike, cabinet ministers, Britain's Prince
Charles, foreign ministers and special envoys of 14 countries, as
well as foreign diplomats accredited to Sri Lanka attended the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
In her speech to the nation, Kumaratunga urged the people to
pluck up their courage, fortitude and vision to bring harmony and
peace to the country.
</P>
<P>
She vowed to end the ethnic strife, which started in 1983,
while defending the territorial integrity of her country.
</P>
<P>
"We must proceed with fortitude to face the daunting challenges
of terrorism and the political and social violence," she said.
</P>
<P>
On arrival at the ceremony venue, the president hoisted a
national flag. It was followed by the singing of the national
anthem by a group of school girls.
</P>
<P>
After that, all the participants observed two minutes' silence
in honor of those patriots who have laid down their lives for the
freedom, unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Sri
Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony came to its climax when a military parade by the
armed forces and a procession of floats were held.
</P>
<P>
The celebrations were held amid extremely tight security. All
the main roads leading to the parliament were sealed off. Large
numbers of armed security personnel were guarding around the main
venue of celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Local and foreign reporters and photographers were frisked and
their cameras, recorders and cellular phones thoroughly examined
before they were allowed to enter the high security zone of the
parliamentary complex.
</P>
<P>
The main function had been scheduled to be held in Kandy, the
ancient capital some 115 km east of Colombo. However, after a bomb
attack by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in the city on
January 25, the government decided to shift the celebrations from
Kandy to Colombo just one week before the Golden Jubilee day.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was only part of the celebration activities to be
held in Sri Lanka these days. On Thursday, a grand exhibition
featuring the country's political, economic and social
achievements in the years after its independence from Britain will
be held in Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Apart from that, scores of government or mass organizations are
going to hold various activities to mark the event. In the mean
time, the LTTE is believed to be doing their best to mar the day.
</P>
<P>
The three services of the armed forces and the police forces
are on high alert to preempt any sabotage.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Parties Meet on Transition Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's five political parties
met in the capital Abuja Tuesday on key issues on the country's
transition to civil rule.
</P>
<P>
But the parties refused to let their decisions known by the
public.
</P>
<P>
Justice Mamman Nasir, Chairman of the Transition
Implementation Committee (TIC), who was asked by the parties to
brief the press after the meeting, said the parties prefer to
consulting with the Head of State General Sani Abacha before making
their resolutions public.
</P>
<P>
"We are in a phase of development of this nation that is very
delicate," he said, adding that things must be done with care to
ensure peace and stability in the entire nation.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports said that the parties may have agreed to
adopt Sani Abacha as their consensus candidate in the
presidential elections scheduled for august 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
They also recommended that the national assembly election
scheduled for April be shifted to August 1, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Despite objections from the United Nigeria Congress Party
(UNCP) which saw a landslide victory in last December's state
house of assembly election, reports said, the parties may have
agreed to cancel the results of that election on the ground of
massive rigging.
</P>
<P>
The party leaders will meet with Head of State General Abacha
as soon as possible to discuss him with resolutions reached at
Tuesday's meeting, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
Speculations of the five parties adopting Abacha as their
consensus candidate have been wild as only Alhaji Mohammed Dikko
Yusuf, a former police chief, has declared his interest to
contest for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Punch, a leading Nigerian newspaper today
quoted Eforo, a member of the TIC as saying that if Abacha is
adopted as the consensus candidate, a national referendum will
replace the presidential elections on August 1.
</P>
<P>
Upon receiving a formal letter from the parties, the TIC will
refer the matter with the Provisional Ruling Council (PRC), the
country's highest decision-making body for ratification.

<HEADLINE> Nepali King Decides to Call Special Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The month-old political
uncertainty in Nepal ended Wednesday as King Birendra decided to
accept the request by 96 MPs to convene a special session of
parliament to discuss their no-confidence motion against the
present government, Radio Nepal said.
</P>
<P>
The special session of parliament will be called for February
11, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
The King made the decision in accordance with the Supreme
Court's advice.
</P>
<P>
Now Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa has to face the censure
motion against him barely four months after he came to power, as
his recommendation to dissolve parliament and hold mid-term
elections was turned down by the King.
</P>
<P>
The 96 MPs from the main opposition Communist Party of Nepal
(United Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML) and Thapa's own National
Democratic Party (RPP) had planned the censure motion in early
January, prompting Thapa to take his own preemptive move.
</P>
<P>
However, King Birendra still could not make a decision after
days of consultations with advisers, legal experts and party
leaders, and he referred the matter to the Supreme Court on
January 13.
</P>
<P>
The case is a delicate one for the court as well, as
recommendations by the prime minister and the MPs are both
constitutional. And what made it more complicated is that the
court had before handed down two conflicting verdicts.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, it ruled that Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala of
the Nepali Congress was within his constitutional authority to
recommend dissolution of parliament for fresh polls.
</P>
<P>
However, the following year it overturned the similar
recommendation made to King Birendra by Prime Minister Man Mohan
Adhikari of the CPN-UML, ruling that dissolution was not allowed
if an alternative government could be formed from the existing
parliament.
</P>
<P>
This time, the court invited party representatives and legal
experts to participate in the week-long discussions which began on
January 19. Prime Minister Thapa's recommendation gained the upper
hand in the discussions. But the nine-member special bench of the
court has the final say.
</P>
<P>
Six of the nine judges including the chief justice favored a
special session of parliament, while the other three voted for
dissolution of parliament for fresh polls.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Slams US, Britain for Military Option </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) has
criticized the United States and Britain for threatening to take
military actions against Iraq, the Egyptian Gazette reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The possible use of force by the U.S. and Britain will cause
tension in the Middle East and damage the Arab national security,
AL Secretary General Ahmed Esmat Abdel-Meguid told reporters
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after briefing the representatives of the
22 members of the Arab League in Cairo on the purpose of his trip
to Baghdad Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that during his visit, he would meet Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein and try to persuade him to "avert a catastrophe."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has barred the arms inspectors of the United Nations
Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of eliminating Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction from searching presidential palaces
suspected of hiding the banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has threatened to force Iraq to grant free access to
the UNSCOM through military action, which is staunchly supported
by Britain.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, many Arab countries joined the U.S.-led coalition
forces to drive Iraq out of Kuwait. But most of them today show
sympathy for the Iraqi people suffering from nearly eight-year-old
U.N. sanctions, and call for maintaining Iraq's security and
sovereignty.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Turkey's Support for Iraqi Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton has
sought Turkey's support in case Washington launches a military
strike against Iraq, local daily Milliyet reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It said that Clinton made known his position in a letter
conveyed to his Turkish counterpart Suleyman Demirel by
U.S. Ambassador to Turkey Marc Parris Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that the U.S.-Turkish friendship is based on "the
two countries' solidarity in the Gulf region," adding that whether
this relationship will continue depends on Turkey's attitude.
</P>
<P>
The letter came as the U.S.-Iraqi stand-off worsened because
Iraq banned U.N. arms inspectors from inspecting presidential
palaces and Turkey called for a peaceful solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Clinton briefed Demirel on the U.S. stand concerning the Iraqi
cisis, saying that there are indications that diplomatic channels
could not put an end to the current situation.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here noted that Clinton is sending a message to Ankara
that the U.S. government is determined to resort to force against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports said that former U.S. president George Bush
had earlier reminded Clinton that he should consult Turkey if a
military operation is needed to be carried out against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
As an important ally of the Western world, Turkey extended
full support to the U.S.-led multinational troops during the 1991
Gulf War which erupted following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
</P>

PARIS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- New revelations on the French oil group Elf-Aquitaine show
that during the civil war in Congo Republic last year, the banking
establishment Fiba, which is controlled by Elf and Gabonese
President Omar Bongo, served as a behind-the-scene intermediary
between former president Pascal Lissouba and arms traffickers.
Created in the 1970s, Fiba handles millions of petrol dollar in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
-- The handling of the Iraqi crisis by the western allies give
the impression of of a great mess. While the United States
ambassador to the United Nations Bill Richardson said the diplomacy
was ``running out of steam,'' France and Russia still believe in the
usefulness of talks, with each of them sending envoys to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The closing of the Superphenix nuclear center by the French
government has provoked a creaking within the leftwing majority,
while the opposition rightwing denounced it as an ``electoral
manoeuvre'' aimed at the regional and cantonal elections to be held
next month. The French Communist Party condemned ``with all
clearness'' the closing of Superphenix ``in the name of independence
of energy'' of France.
</P>
<P>
-- The Paris Police Department asked Parisians not to borrow
vehicles and use public transport Wednesday to lower the level of
air pollution which has attained level two in the capital. The speed
of automobiles is also being limited and anti-pollution measures
reinforced.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Cabinet Minister Leaves for Gulf Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Minister of State
for Cabinet Affairs and acting Foreign Minister Abdul Aziz Dakhil
Al-Dakhil left here Wednesday for Qatar starting a tour of Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) states.
</P>
<P>
An official at the Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry was quoted by the
Kuwaiti News Agency as saying that the tour stemmed from Kuwait's
desire to coordinate with its Gulf allies regarding the crisis of
weapons inspections in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has barred the inspectors of the United Nations Special
Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of eliminating Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction from searching presidential palaces suspected of
hiding banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
The United States has threatened to take military actions to
force Iraq to grant free access to the UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti official said that during the tour, Al-Dakhil will
deliver letters to the leaders of the GCC states from Kuwaiti Emir
Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said Kuwait is to explain its position on the
need to compel Baghdad to comply with the U.N. Security Council
resolutions and destroy its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Iraq invaded its neighbor Kuwait in August 1990, but was driven
out by the U.S.-led multi-nation forces in the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has taken precautions, including raising the level of
readiness of the armed forces, to ward off Iraqi retaliation for
possible U.S. military actions.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf Cooperation Council, a regional political, economic
and military alliance, groups Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the
United Arab Emirates, Oman and Bahrain.

<HEADLINE> Israel Renews Trade Risk Insurance for S. Korea, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 4 (Xinhua) -- As a result of the improved
prospects of economic stability in Southeast Asia, Israel has
decided to renew the government-backed foreign trade-risk
insurance to Thailand and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The 75 million U.S. dollars in insurance against political and
commercial risk offered by the Israel Foreign Trade Risk
Insurance Company was halted about six weeks ago, The Jerusalem
Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The situation was unclear regarding the area. Today, there
are much better indications, following the debt arrangements
reached with the Word Bank and the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) for South Korea and Thailand," head of the insurance
company Doron Klausner said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The World Band and the IMF have arranged a 60 billion dollars
bailout for South Korea and 17.2 billion dollars for
Thailand. "We believe those countries will be able to meet
commitments," Klausner said.
</P>
<P>
Shahar Meidan, business development manager at the Tel Aviv
office of Nissho Iwai, Japan's sixth largest conglomerate, said
the renewal of the insurance will help Israeli companies feel
more secure about doing business in the Far East.
</P>
<P>
"One of the biggest problems with the Southeast Asian crisis
is the psychological effect. The renewal of insurance doesn't
make it more worthwhile, but increases the security of Israeli
companies," said Meidan.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt that the Asia situation will have an affect
on Israeli industry. Israeli companies will now invest more in
other markets, including Japan which is not suffering much from
the crisis and Europe and the U.S.." he noted.

<HEADLINE> Drought Threatens Northeastern Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Drought has been listed as one
of the major environmental factors threatening farming in the
northeastern Nigeria, the Daily Times quoted a biologist as
reporting on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Most affected are the states of Borno, Yobe and Bauchi,
said Marths Verinumbe, a lecturer in the department of
biological sciences at the University of Maiduguri at a recent
seminar.
</P>
<P>
She said land degradation, reduction in land productivity and
income as well as loss of livelihood were the direct effect of
low rainfall, sparse vegetation, increased soil erosion and
decreased soil fertility.
</P>
<P>
The problem, she said, had also affected water supply for
domestic and agricultural needs, reduced the socio-economic
development and well-being of the people as well as depleting
plant and wildlife resources, which often led to reduction in
food, income and recreation.
</P>
<P>
The cutting of trees for fuel-wood and construction,
collection of other non-timber forest products such as gum,
fruits, nuts, vegetables and seeds as well as the massive
clearing of lands for farming activities contributed
significantly to environmental degradation.
</P>
<P>
The lecturer recommended, among other things, the government
provide alternative grazing areas to reduce the demand pressure
on trees as well as raise public awareness with respect to the
maintenance or sustainability of scarce forest resources.
</P>
<P>
According to other researchers, the major causes of the
environmental problem in northeastern Nigeria include
desertification which leads to prolonged droughts, poor water
resources management, wind erosion, deforestation and land
degradation.

the United States was published in the government gazette, the
radio said, adding that another plan to build 500 homes for Arabs
in the area was also agreed by the ministry and published in the
gazette.
</P>
<P>
Moscowitz reportedly bought a plot in the Arab neighborhood
more than a decade ago, on which he has intended to build a Jewish
settlement.
</P>
<P>
Last September, the Interior Ministry rejected two appeals
against the construction of the settlement filed by two leftist
city councillors, clearing a major obstacle to the project.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blocked the start
of the construction, citing concerns about sparking widespread
Palestinian violence.
</P>
<P>
To press their calls to start the construction, four rightist
Jewish families moved into two houses bought by Moscowitz on
September 14 last year, triggering strong protests from the
Palestinians and Israeli peace activists.
</P>
<P>
Under a deal with the government, the settlers were late
evacuated and replaced by a group of religious Jewish students.
</P>
<P>
Despite the approval by the Interior Ministry, the Israeli
government is unlikely to start the construction of the housing
units in Ras Amud Arab neighborhood at the moment to avoid
Palestinian violence.
</P>
<P>
An aide for Netanyahu was quoted by the radio as saying that
the government has means to stop the project.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority has blasted the Ras Amud
project as part of Israel's attempt to judaize Arab East Jerusalem
which was occupied by Israel in 1967.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their
future independent state.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Foreign Exchange Reserves Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese gross foreign exchange
reserves rose 108 million U.S. dollars in January this year,
bringing the country's total reserves to 6.039 billion dollars,
local newspaper the Beirut Times reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It quoted a central bank source as saying that the renewed
faith in the Lebanese pound and increased swapping of dollars for
the local currency were the main reasons for the increase in
foreign exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
The faith came following the deposits which were made by Gulf
countries at the Lebanese central bank in recent weeks, the
source added.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Kuwaiti government deposited 100 million
dollars at 5 percent interest for three years, while in
December, Saudi Arabia's National Commercial Bank deposited 500
million dollars at the same interest and for the same
duration.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Chaya, senior official of Lebanese leading bank Banque
Audi, said that the approval of the 1998 budget by parliament
last week had also boosted confidence locally.

<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng met
with China Information chairman Feng D, publisher Zhu Yongkang and
Editor-in-Chief Xu Jingen in Beijing on December 29, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Li answered their questions concerning the reform of
state-owned enterprises, democracy and the legal system, the
current world situation, Sino-U.S. relations, Sino-Japanese
relations, and other issues of interest.
</P>
<P>
Following is the full text of Li's interview with the monthly
English journal published in the United States:
</P>
<P>
China Information (CI): How much confidence does the Chinese
government have in the success of state-owned enterprise reform
and what special measures have been taken to prevent possible
setbacks?
</P>
<P>
Li Peng: First of all, we should make it clear that the
situation in China's state-owned enterprises is not as serious as
some Western media reports have made it seem. Some large
state-owned enterprises run well. The year 1997 witnessed major
reform in the state-owned enterprises and optimistic changes in
enterprise benefits. A group of large and mid-sized enterprises
have received support, and many enterprises and enterprise groups
have emerged with practical economic strength and vitality.
</P>
<P>
State-owned enterprises are still the main tax payers in
China. There are certain difficulties faced by them, and that is
the reason for the reform. The direction is to establish a modern
enterprise system, change the management system, and turn these
enterprises into new entities that adopt a system of personal
responsibility for profit and loss and practice independent
management, clearly identify ownership, and separate
administration from these enterprises. We have good examples in
this respect. The problem is that some people worry about social
problems caused by more redundant workers following further
reform.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Reaffirms Ban on Political Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Uganda reaffirmed the ban on
political activities of various parties before referendum in
2,000, The New Vision reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Emmanuel Kerenga, State Minister for Justice and
Constitutional Affairs, said the ban will be lifted only if the
electors voted in favor of a multi-party system in the referendum
to be held in 2,000.
</P>
<P>
Kerenga made the announcement against the background that a
report carried by local paper The Monitor said political
activities will be lifted by June this year.
</P>
<P>
The Political Organisations Bill being drafted may relax or
tighten the restriction imposed on party activities, but the bill
will not lift the ban on political activities of parties, he
added.
</P>
<P>
According to the the state minister, the next presidential and
parliament elections will be held in 2001 under a system which
the electorate of the country will vote for in the referendum.
But those advocating for multi-party system will be allowed to
start their campaigning in June 1,999, a year before the
referendum.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has reaffirmed that
multi-party system did not apply to Uganda. There is a prefeudal
social structure in the country, and introduction of a
multi-party system will lead to tribalism which will distabilize
the country, he underlined.

Li Peng: Years of reforms show us that once we have adequately
settled the relationships among reform, development and stability,
we can solve these problems as well. Development is our goal,
reform is the motive force, and stability is the condition.
</P>
<P>
We will readjust the reform each year according to the
practical conditions in the nation, so that the people and the
enterprises can bear the changes. Take reform in the price system
for instance. We have gradually lifted the control over prices year
by year, and now the prices of most commodities are controlled by
the market. But the prices of some key commodities that are
significant to the national economy and people's livelihood
remain under state control.
</P>
<P>
The reforms in state-owned enterprises are the same. We will
try to establish a modern enterprise system in most large and
mid-sized state-owned enterprises by the end of this century, but
this doesn't mean that the system should be established in all
such enterprises. We will make new progress in state-owned
enterprise reform with better economic benefits in 1998 by means
of reform, regrouping, renovation and the strengthening of
management according to different situations.
</P>
<P>
We have obtained a great deal of experience in solving such
problems. We will take into consideration the ability of the
people and the enterprises to bear the burdens of reform during
the whole process. We will quicken our steps if the conditions are
good and slow down if the conditions are not ripe. In short, we
will maintain continuous progress. We are quite confident in the
success of state-owned enterprises.

Li: We will further strengthen the work on the basis of our
achievements in democracy and legal system. The work is carried
out according to the actual situation in China, not according to
Western values. Conditions vary in different countries and so do
democracy and legal system. The United States adopts direct
elections. But actually, the selection is only between two
candidates. Still they claim it the greatest democracy. While in
China the people's congress system requires direct elections in
grass-roots units and indirect elections in the upper leadership
from 3,000 representatives. This represents different values and
different social conditions. The Westerners seem to be interested
in the recent direct elections in townships, which they don't
realize has been the practice in China for years.
</P>
<P>
Along with the deepening of reform, we will ensure the people
fully enjoy their rights as the masters of the country in
accordance with the Constitution, such as their supervision over
governmental work, criticizing the shortcomings in the government
work through the media and public opinion, and exposing corruption
in the society, so as to enable the people's congresses at all
levels to play a full role. The best standard is to satisfy the
Chinese public. We can learn something useful from the West, such
as news supervision. But our news criticism is different from
theirs. Our news reports are based on serious investigation to
ensure the fidelity of the news, which is obviously different from
some fake reporting for temporary or sensational efforts in the
Western news media. The supervision by our news media and public
opinion will be reinforced in the future.
</P>
<P>
In regard to human rights, we hold that there are different
points of view on this issue. The West stresses the human rights
of individuals. To them, the individual's human rights are supreme
and beyond the interests of the collectives and state, and cannot
be infringed at all. Still, even judging by their own standards,
the human rights situation in the West is not satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
China is a developing socialist country that had experienced a
semi-colonial and semi-feudal history. The Chinese people have
been liberated only after a long and unremitting struggle, which
means they have obtained great human rights. The next step is to
gain the rights to exist and to develop and then improve
individual human rights. We use the word "improve" because the
building of democracy and legal system in China is a process of
progressive and continuous completion and improvement, which
complies well with the actual condition of the country. It is
improper or unrealistic to judge China's democracy and legal
system and human rights condition by Western standards.

CI: The development of China has become a focus of media
reports since the 1990s. But the Westerners have a common worry
that a powerful China will prove a threat to regional
stability. During his visit to the United States, President Jiang
Zemin reiterated that China would never seek hegemony. How can we
convince the West of the truth of this stand?
</P>
<P>
Li: Your question reflects the fact that many Westerners don't
have a good understanding of China. China is the largest developing
country and has concentrated on the economic development. After
New China was founded, especially over the past two decades since
the reform and open policy were initiated, China's economy has
made rapid progress and national strength has reinforced. However,
with a population of more than 1.2 billion, and a poor foundation,
the per-capita GNP is still fairly low. When many foreigners come
to China, what they visit are merely developed cities of Shanghai,
Beijing and Shenzhen, but not the backward and poor central and
western regions. So they can't imagine that there are still 50
million Chinese living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
We have made a three-step strategy for development, the target
for the middle of the next century is to reach the level of
moderately-developed countries. It will take much longer to
reach levels as seen in the United States. To realize the
three-step development strategy and enhance the material and
cultural living standards of the people, on the one hand we need a
stable domestic political situation, and a peaceful international
environment on the other, especially a friendly
neighborhood. These are the preconditions for continuous
development in China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people know well the significance of peace and
stability, and China opposes hegemony and will never seek hegemony
or any sphere of influence. This is the solemn promise the Chinese
government has made to the whole world, and it has been determined
by the nature of our country. China will never be a threat to any
other country or region. Those who spread the myth of the "China
threat" have ulterior motives. The military force of China is for
defensive purposes only and "we will not attack unless we are
attacked."

CI: How does China view today's world order?
</P>
<P>
Li: Great changes have taken place in the world situation. The
trend toward a multi-polar situation is accelerating more
obviously than ever before. The concept of multi-polarity has been
accepted by more and more countries, and most people think
multi-polarity is better than single polarity and is beneficial to
the whole world. It is unimaginable that the whole world of some
200 countries and a population of more than 5 billion could be
ruled by one country. When observing the current world situation,
people have noticed that the relations between big powers are
being adjusted, economic and military safety elements have become
ever more prominent in international relations, and developing
countries are playing a significant role in promoting the
formation of a multi-polar situation and ending the irrational old
international political and economic orders. All these are
characteristics that should be noticed in the present-day
international situation.
</P>
<P>
China adheres to an independent and peaceful diplomatic policy
and seeks friendly neighbor relations. To be independent means not
to blindly follow others, but to have our own point of view on
world affairs and our own principles in viewing international or
regional disputes to make objective and just judgments on
particular issues.
</P>
<P>
A peaceful diplomacy ensures that all foreign diplomatic
actions will be beneficial to world peace because only under a
peaceful environment can development be realized. One of the most
important principles stuck to by the Chinese nation is a friendly
neighborhood and actively developing relations with neighboring
countries. Remarkable accomplishments have been achieved in this
regard in recent years.

CI: Fairly great improvements have been made in Sino-U.S. and
Sino-Japanese relations. President Jiang Zemin has visited the
United States and you have visited Japan. But there are still some
problems in Sino-U.S. and Sino-Japanese relations, what do you
think of the prospects for these relations?
</P>
<P>
Li: President Jiang Zemin paid a state visit to the United
States, which was the greatest event in China's foreign affairs in
1997. It was the first visit by a Chinese head-of-state to the
United States in the past 12 years and was a significant
breakthrough, marking an end to the West's unjust sanction against
China. The visit was a great success and helped strengthen mutual
understanding, and expand common ground for future cooperation. It
promoted Sino-U.S. relations, shifting to a new stage of
development.
</P>
<P>
We have all along taken Sino-U.S. relations
seriously. Naturally, the United States will hold one pole in a
multi-polar situation, and an important pole at that. China will
not underestimate the role played by the United States in the
world. There are many things we could learn from the United States
in economic strength, science, technology and culture. But we
could never agree to the U.S. claiming of "leadership over the
world" and I'm afraid that most countries in the world won't agree
to that.
</P>
<P>
We cannot tolerate U.S. interference in the internal affairs of
other countries. The United States always tries to place its
domestic laws beyond international laws and requires other
countries to abide by U.S. laws. This is the divergence between us
and the United States. But we have all along thought that there
are wide common interests between the two countries, which is the
foundation for mutual cooperation. We should try to seek common
ground while reserving differences, reduce conflicts and increase
dialogue to prevent contradictions and divergence from becoming
intensified.
</P>
<P>
From another point of view, the divergence between the United
States and China is partly because of a lack of mutual
understanding. In the mind of some U.S. senators we have spoken
with, China is still the backward image described in old movies or
novels, and they know very little about the present China, or what
they have heard is a pack of completely distorted facts. We hope
we can gain more mutual understanding and more common ground
through contacts and exchanges.

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake City Discussing More Women Sports in 2002 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Host for the 2002 Olympic
Winter Games Salt Lake City is considering to add more women sports in
their programme for the games.
</P>
<P>
The Salt Lake City Organizing Committee (SLOC) president Frank
Joklik said at a press conference here Wednesday afternoon that the
SLOC is discussing to include women's ski jumping, bob and luge at the
2002 Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"We'll work with the international federations to discuss what
additional sports may be considered for 2002," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the issue of new sports was underpinned by financial
considerations, but he explained adding more athletes -- such as women
-- to already existing facilities would not be impossible financially.
</P>
<P>
"There are financial considerations, but it is not like when a new
facility has to be built," he added.
</P>
<P>
Adding more sports might be an easy task for the SLOC, but winning
support of Utah citizens for the games could be difficult for the
organizers.
</P>
<P>
SLOC officials admitted that Utah citizens remain negative about
the 2002 games. "The perception among Utans is not what it should be,"
said SLOC media head Shelley Thomas. "We feel there's been a lot of
misinformation and misunderstanding. We have a big job ahead of us
getting the facts out in a more organized fashion than inthe past."
</P>
<P>
But she added SLOC had been making progress. "We've gone out of our
way to ensure we explain and spread message of the Olympics throughout
the state of Utah and I think we've made considerable progress," she
added.

We should say that China has much more knowledge about the
United States than the United States has about us. Only after they
had been to China did many U.S. senators find that the situation
is totally different from what they had in their minds. The visits
help change their minds; at least help increase their
understanding of the country, which is not an easy job at
all. More understanding will be a good to promoting Sino-US
relations. So we hope more Americans can come to China, to have a
look at both the developed regions and the underdeveloped
regions. Then they will get a comprehensive understanding of China.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Japanese relations have been developing smoothly in the
past 25 years since diplomatic relation between the two countries
were normalized. China and Japan are two countries that play
important roles in the Asian-Pacific region and the world. The
Joint Declaration Between the Government of the People's Republic
of China and the Government of Japan and the Treaty of Peace and
Friendship Between China and Japan are the foundation for the
development of Sino-Japanese relations.

The core problem in Sino-Japanese relation is how to correctly
understand and regard Japan's invasion of China. We must eliminate
disturbance and settle the issue properly in order to develop
relations in a healthy way. The shadow caused by Japan's invasion
of China during World War II still exists today, and the
militarism and right-wing elements in Japan try to disturb and
destroy Sino-Japanese relations from time to time and some
Japanese politicians still do not hold a correct understanding of
the historical facts.
</P>
<P>
During my visit to Japan, I stressed time and again that it was
not the matter of Japan alone which road the nation takes, but a
matter of concern to Sino-Japanese relations and stability in the
neighborhood, and the world as well. After World War II, Japan
followed a peaceful road of development and achieved great
economic progress. It should continue to stick to the peaceful
development road, which will benefit Japan and win the nation the
trust of the people of Asia and the world, and it will bring more
common ground between our two countries. The youths in Japan today
know little of their history and they should be educated with
correct concepts of history if we are to realize generations of
friendship between our two countries.
</P>
<P>
Li summed up his remarks by saying the achievements made in
China's diplomatic work are based on those accomplished in
domestic work. He said the formal establishment of diplomatic
relations between China and South Africa is another great
achievement in China's diplomatic work. "Only after we have done
the domestic job well can we make more progress in diplomatic work
and our words on internations stages be taken seriously," the
premier added.

<HEADLINE> Auto Industry Witnesses Stable Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- China's automobile
manufacturing sector witnessed stable growth in terms of both
production and marketing in 1997, industry sources said.
</P>
<P>
The growth has been attributed to the fact that the sector
escaped the shackles of the planned economy and continued to
improve its structure and market exploration.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Motor Vehicles Department of the Ministry
of Machine-Building Industry show that state manufacturing
enterprises produced nearly 1.58 million motor vehicles and sold
1.56 million during 1997, up 7.37 percent and 7.82 percent on
1996, respectively. The sector's production-sales rate stood at
99.34 percent.
</P>
<P>
The sector's product mix witnessed significant improvement
during 1997, with the 481,600 units produced accounting for 30
percent of the nation's total output of motor vehicles. The
production figure represented a 24.22 percent rise on 1996.
</P>
<P>
The 474,200 automobiles sold during 1997 represented 22.88
percent growth on 1996. Santana model vehicles manufactured by
the Shanghai Volkswagen Corporation, a Sino-German joint venture,
led the nation in terms of both output and sales volume.
</P>
<P>
The Fukang model produced Citroen in central China's Hubei
Province, Auto (Aotuo) model by the Chang'an Company in Chongqing
and Jetta model by the First Automobile Works Corporation in Jilin
Province all witnessed expanding ranges in terms of both
production and marketing.
</P>
<P>
The annual growth rate for the production of mini-vans and
mini-buses has remained above 20.6 percent since 1990. A total of
156,000 mini-vans were produced in 1997, with the sales volume for
the year surpassing 160,000 units. Some 226,000 mini-buses were
produced and 212,400 units were sold during the year.
</P>
<P>
China produced 4,300 large buses in 1997, up 14.9 percent on
1996, with sales rising by 34.3 percent to 4,900 units. The
industry also produced and marketed some 31,000 heavy-duty trucks
during the year.
</P>
<P>
The auto industry's product mix has adapted to market changes,
with reduced production of medium-sized and light-weight trucks
and buses, both of which were formerly prime product categories
for the country's motor vehicle industry.
</P>
<P>
A total of 204,500 medium-sized and 477,100 light-weight motor
vehicles were produced in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The chaotic state affecting China's auto industry in recent
years has been brought under control along with the implementation
of development policies and improvements in the degree of
centralized production.
</P>
<P>
Each of 14 Chinese auto makers currently produce over 10,000
motor vehicles annually.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Gov't Banks Urged to Lower Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines is encouraging government banks to lead the way in
bringing down the high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson said Wednesday that the
Monetary Board, the central bank's highest decision making body,
has urged these banks to take the first step toward achieving
lending rates acceptable to the public.
</P>
<P>
The country's government banks include Land Bank of the
Philippines, the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP), the
Philippine National Bank and some other banks.
</P>
<P>
Singson explained that if this was successfully done, the
current interest rates could be reduced to between 20 to 21
percent.
</P>
<P>
If this happens, he said, commercial banks which are identified
to be imposing the high lending rates between 23 to 32 percent
could follow the trend later.
</P>
<P>
Singson said the central bank cannot force these banks to bring
down the interest rates because it is not implementable under the
present market situation wherein almost all the banks are using
the prevailing interest rates.
</P>
<P>
But the Monetary Board is finalizing a plan that would oblige
government lending agencies to take the lead in bringing down real
estate loans to as low as 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
High interest rates have been blamed for hampering corporations
from expanding business and worsening the effects of the currency
crisis on the economy.

<HEADLINE> Federation Asked to Improve Doping Record: German Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, February 4 (Xinhua) -- A leading German sports official
has on Wednesday asked Olympic leaders to mount pressure on
bodybuilding to clean up the sport.
</P>
<P>
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) executive board
member Thomas Bach said the doping record of the sport had to be
improved before it could be allowed full recognition.
</P>
<P>
Bodybuilding's international federation has just won
provisional recognition by the IOC.
</P>
<P>
"That is the advantage of giving recognition to a sport rather
than ignoring it. You can put more pressure on it in that way,"
Bach said.
</P>
<P>
The international federations of speedboating, motorcycling and
sumo wrestling have also been granted provisional recognition at
an IOC meeting before the Nagano Winter Olympics, which start this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
Provisional recognition just means federations accept certain
Olympic principles and allows the IOC to work more closely with
officials in the sport.

<HEADLINE> S. African Producer Inflation at 27-Year Low in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 4 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's producer
inflation dropped last month to its lowest level in almost 27
years, reinforcing forecasts of an interest rate cut as early as
next month.
</P>
<P>
The year-on-year increase in the producer price index (PPI)
was four percent in December, the lowest since September 1971
when it was 3.7 percent, according to Central Statistical Service
figures released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The annualized PPI increase rate, which peaked at 9.6 percent
in March, was 4.7 percent in November.
</P>
<P>
The PPI rate in December fell below economists' forecast of
4.2 percent. The month-on-month rise between November and
December was a modest 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the PPI figure provided further evidence that
South Africa was winning the battle against inflation. Some
forecast an interest rate cut before the end of the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South Africa's consumer inflation maintained a
downward trend for six consecutive months till December when it
fell to 6.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, what dampens hopes for the early easing of interest
rates was money supply increase, which was still well beyond the
central bank's target of 10 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Today's Economic Daily reported
that China's foreign trade volume for machinery and electronics
products totaled 118.6 billion US dollars for 1997, thereby
basically achieving the first-ever trade balance for said products.
</P>
<P>
China exported related products valued at 59.32 billion US
dollars during 1997, up 23 percent on the previous year, with
imports falling by 3.2 percent to 59.33 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 trade volume for machinery and electronics products
grew 8.3 percent and accounted for 36.5 percent of the nation's
total foreign trade volume of 325.06 billion US dollars. The
latter figure represented a 12.1 percent rise on 1996.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper reported that China will further improve its
import and export structure by encouraging the importation of
advanced technology and equipment. The country will also avoid
repetitive imports and will provide greater support for exports of
machinery and electronics products.
</P>
<P>
China will strive to export machinery and electronic products
valued at 60 billion US dollars during 1998 in order to promote
national economic growth, according to the newspaper.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 4 (Xinhua) -- A light aircraft
nose-dived into a coffee farm near the Arusha Airport in northern
Tanzania on Monday morning, killing the pilot and all four
foreign passengers.
</P>
<P>
The six-seater aircraft Cessna 207, belonging to a private
company Precision Air, crashed two minutes after it took off from
the airport, local media reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The foreigners include Italian nationals Ferry and his wife
Nobile, as well as Mohammed Hussein from Switzerland and
Szutenberg from Poland.
</P>
<P>
Their bodies, burnt beyond recognition, are lying at Mount
Meru Hospital mortuary in Arusha, said the Precision Air Branch
Manager for Arusha, Philemon Kisamo.
</P>
<P>
The plane, chartered by the four tourists, was flying towards
the Zanzibar isles. About two minutes after take-off at 7:50 am,
the pilot Moses Materu reported a technical problem in the engine
and planned to return to Arusha airport for emergency landing.
</P>
<P>
However, the plane burst into flames before falling into the
coffee farm in Burka estate, less than five kilometers from the
airport, eyewitnesses said.
</P>
<P>
The tourists had just completed tours to the well-known game
parks in Ngorongoro, Serengeti and Tarangire and were heading for
the final leg in Zanzibar for a week's holiday before returning

<HEADLINE> Iran: No Dialog With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 4 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iranian official
Wednesday reiterated that Iran will not recognize Israel and
rejects any contact with it.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here Wednesday morning, Vice
President and head of the Environmental Protection Organization
Masoumeh Ebtekar rejected any contact or dialog with the Israeli
government.
</P>
<P>
"There are Jews in Iran and we respect them," she said, adding
that Iran also has no problems with the Israeli Jews.
</P>
<P>
Ebtekar once again denied her interview with the Israeli daily
Yedioth Ahronoth, expressing "surprise and regret" that the
Israeli newspaper made such baseless claim.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli daily claimed Sunday that Ebtekar announced her
support for a dialog between Iran and Israel in "the first
interview by an Iranian political figure with an Israeli
newspaper."
</P>
<P>
However, the Iranian vice president immediately denied such an
interview, saying that "raising such unfounded claims is a clear
example of mischief by the Zionist news circles."
</P>
<P>
Referring to her stance towards the United States, Ebtekar
said "we do not have any problems with the American people, but we
do have problems with the U.S. politicians."
</P>
<P>
She criticized the U.S. military presence in the Persian Gulf
region, terming the presence of foreign warships in the Gulf as
one of the main factors of the pollution in the region.
</P>
<P>
"It is our great concern that foreign warships released
chemical pollutants in the Persian Gulf," she said, adding
that all the ships in the international waters should respect
international norms, including laws on environmental protection.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Government Urged to Stop Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 4 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 Members of
Parliament from the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU)
has asked the government to act firmly and bring to an end the
violence in Rift Valley province, Kenya Times reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued Tuesday after a KANU parliamentary group
meeting said the on-going clashes in the province had begun in
constituencies of the opposition Democratic Party of Kenya (DP).
</P>
<P>
It recalled that along with some elements in opposition
Safina, DP had vowed to make the country ungovernable prior to
the just concluded general elections.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting chaired by President Daniel arap Moi who is
the KANU national chairman, KANU MPs urged the government to take
harsh action against individuals promoting inter-ethnic violence.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that first reconciliation talks were held
Tuesday at Rongai divisional headquarters of Nakuru district
between Kalenjin and Kikuyu elders.
</P>
<P>
The meeting decided that more police posts be created in the
troubled areas of the Rift Valley province.
</P>
<P>
The elders held that the violence which killed about 100
people in the past several weeks was "political" and had nothing
to do with ethnicity.

<HEADLINE> Gerontological Issue in China in 21st Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Over one-fourth of China's
population, or more than 400 million people, will reach or surpass
the age of 60 at mid-21st century, according to today's People's
Daily (overseas edition).
</P>
<P>
China has to face aging challenges in the coming century, said
demographers. Who will take care of the aged people is a grave and
urgent challenge to China in the coming century, the country's
leading newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Among China's present 120 million old people, 80 million live
in rural China. Unlike some of the elderly people in urban areas
who enjoy pension insurance, the aged rural people can only rely
on their children for the rest of their life, it said.
</P>
<P>
China has had a sharp drop in fertility since it started the
"one-child per couple" policy in 1980, and specialists predict
that China will become an aging society at the end of this
century, it noted.
</P>
<P>
The number of people above 60 will increase to 130 million by
then, 10 percent of the population, and then increase to 280
million in 2025, and to about 400 million in 2050, accounting for
more than a quarter of the country's population, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The traditional way in which the family takes care of the
elderly, however, has been weakened. One young or middler-aged
couple has to take care of four elderly and one child, meaning
resources that can provide care for the elderly are decreasing,
the paper noted.
</P>
<P>
China needs to improve its social security system while
developing its economy in the next two decades to meet the aging
challenge of the next century, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The aging population in China now accounts for 9.7 percent of
the total and is increasing by an annual average rate of 3.2
percent. "China will soon enter a gerontological society," the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary for the country to provide adequate economic
support for aged people both in the cities and the countryside
with a pension insurance system that has the widest coverage, the
paper stressed.
</P>
<P>
Demographers suggest that elderly people, on the one hand,
should have the awareness of taking care of themselves or taking
care of each other and, on the other side, the government should
establish a system that the elderly are to be taken good care of,
it said.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, the first city that has one tenth of its population
above the age of 60, has worked out insurance measures for both
workers and farmers. More than 60 percent of all rural aged people
in the city have bought pension insurance, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Rescuers Recover Items at Philippine Plane Crash Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Rescuers Wednesday recovered
some debris of the ill-fated Cebu Pacific DC-9 passenger plane
after they reached the crash site in the Mt. Sumagaya, Mindanao,
official military reports said.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the Philippine Army headquarters at Camp
Evangelista in the Southern city of Cagayan de Oro said rescuers
retrieved passengers' calling cards, plane curtains and flags,
which were all scattered near the summit of Mt. Sumagaya.
</P>
<P>
A team of army rangers was expected to reach the exact crash
site at about 14:00 (local time). It was not known yet if the
rescuers had recovered any bodies or body parts of the victims,
the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Philippine national Police Chief Santiago Alino
appealed to members of the New People's Army, the armed wing of
the rebel National Democratic Front who are hiding in the mountain
area, not to attack government troops joining the search and
rescue operations.
</P>
<P>
Alino's plea came following reports that the rebel troops
opened fire at army rangers who passed by near their mountain
lair.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would welcome it if the rebels offered
to help in the ongoing search and rescue operations.
</P>
<P>
No survivors had been found at the crash site of the plane
carrying 104 people, including five crew members, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
The passenger plane went missing Monday on a flight from the
capital Manila to Cagayan de Oro City, Mindanao in the Southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
While air search operations were hampered Wednesday morning due
to poor visibility in the mountain area, ground rescuer teams
continued their march toward the crash site of the plane.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine air force Tuesday spotted the wreckage site of
the Cebu Pacific plane on the northeast slope below the peak of
Mt. Sumagaya at an elevation of about 6,700 feet (2,040 meters)
above sea level.
</P>
<P>
There were conflicting reports about casualties in the air
disaster Tuesday. In the morning, the official Philippine News
Agency said members of a non-governmental organization team had
found 15 survivors and 30 bodies in Mt. Sumagaya, Claveria,
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
But the Cebu Pacific Air, the owner of the plane, said later
that reports about the survivors might not be true.
</P>
<P>
The mountainous area is on the flight route of the ill-starred
passenger plane which lost radio contact with the Lumbia airport
air tower while flying over the area.
</P>
<P>
The plane, which took off from Manila Domestic Airport at 09:30
Monday, was scheduled to land in the Lumbia airport, some 500
miles (800 km) south of Manila, at about 11:00 a.m.
</P>
<P>
But the plane, which made a brief stopover in Tacloban city,
failed to arrive at the destination.
</P>
<P>
The Cebu Pacific Air, owned 49 percent by Filipino-Chinese
billionaire John Gokongwei, started operations in March 1996.
</P>
<P>
The airline is one of several new airlines established after
the Philippine government deregulated the aviation industry two
and a half years ago. It has had no previous accidents.

Kenya Army erected a temporary bridge at River Thange, the Daily
Nation reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The line of trucks which stretched over 40 kilometers on
either side of the bridge started to move slowly, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
A.M.H. Sharawe, Permanent Secretary for Public Works of Kenya,
told the paper that the temporary bridge would be operational
until a new bridge is constructed.
</P>
<P>
Army Commander Augustine Cheruyoit instructed police to ensure
no vehicle weighing more than 60 tons is allowed through.
</P>
<P>
The highway was closed last Friday after the Thange bridge
collapsed under the force of raging flood water from Kyulu hills
following heavy rains caused by the El Nino phenomenon in the
past three months.
</P>
<P>
The highway has been closed twice in less than 20 days.
</P>
<P>
The Mombasa-Nairobi road is a vital section linking Port
Mombasa with the sections of the hinterland in Kenya, Uganda,
northern Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi and eastern Democratic
Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
In the Coast Province, provincial Works Officer Iwiva Mpare
said, his department has started repairing all the damaged
bridges in the province.
</P>
<P>
Repairing the bridges in the whole province would cost more
than 100 million Kenyan Shillings (about 1.6 million U.S.
Dollars), he noted.

<HEADLINE> Norway's Speed Skaters Practice with New Slap Skates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Norway's national champion
Njoes Grunde skated in the Nagano rink with new slap skates on
Wednesday, saying he is happy and ready for the upcoming Winter
Olympic Games slated for February 7-22.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian, who has placed several third in World Cup series in
the past, will compete in the 500m and 1,000m races in the Games.
</P>
<P>
"I am hoping for a finish in the top three here," said Grunde, who
sees the skaters from Canada and the Netherlands as his main rivals.
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese are also very good, but they are not handling the
transition to slap skates very well," Grunde said.
</P>
<P>
"I changed in Autumn 1997 while many people changed earlier than I
did -- in earlier 1997. It is not that difficult to change, but it is
difficult to get that last second which will get a time making a new
personal best.
</P>
<P>
"I haven't done it yet, but I am close and I hope to do it in the
Games."
</P>
<P>
The slap skates, an invention by a group of researchers in
biomechanics from the university of Amsterdam, were first introduced
in 1994. As the blade is only connected to the toe, the heel is
released allowing a skater to use his or her power to the full while
the blade remains on the ice for a longer period of time when a stride
is taken.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Negotiators from the Philippine
government and the rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF)
resumed their initial peace talks Wednesday morning in a southern
Philippine city.
</P>
<P>
The technical committees from both sides gathered at a
university in Marawi City, capital of Lanao del Sur Province in
northern Mindanao, the local television SNN reported from the
city.
</P>
<P>
The negotiators are expected to discuss recent skirmishes
between the MILF and the government troops in Buldon Town,
Maguindanao Province, in which dozens of people on both sides were
killed and the scheduled peace talks were almost derailed.
</P>
<P>
The MILF had earlier accused the government of attacking its
camps in Maguindanao, and threatened to boycott the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Another major topic for the two-day meeting is the possibility
of and the agenda for reaching a preliminary peace agreement to
end decades of MILF separatist movement in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, which had refused to be part of the peace treaty
signed in 1996 by the larger Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF)
and the government, wants a separate peace accord with Manila.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a breakaway faction of the MNLF but more radical, has
fought the government for a separate Islamic state in Mindanao
since the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is currently the strongest anti-government force in
the Philippines, with an estimated 12,000 fighters.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government is also seeking to open peace talks
with another Muslim rebel group, the extremist Abu Sayaaf, but the
group has shunned any contacts with the government.

<P>
LUSAKA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The son of former Zambian
President Kenneth Kaunda was suspected of hiding arms in homes
of the opposition United National Independence Party (UNIP)
led by Kaunda, The Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
UNIP cadre Johannes Banda told the local newspaper on Tuesday
that a team of 10 policemen led by Detective Inspector Siafwa
raided his home and those of his two sons in Lusaka last week
searching for arms believed to have been hidden there by Kaunda's
son Major Wezi Kaunda.
</P>
<P>
"I was woken up later in the night around 22:00 hours only to
find a group of armed policemen who demanded to search my house.
They told me that they wanted to search for guns which Major
Kaunda had left in the afternoon," Banda said.
</P>
<P>
Finding nothing in Banda's house, they went to search the home
of his son, where they also didn't find anything, said the report.
</P>
<P>
"The group then searched my other son's home where they also
failed to find any guns," Banda added.
</P>
<P>
Former President Kaunda was arrested on December 25 last year
in alleged connection with the October 28 foiled coup and shifted
to house arrest six days after the arrest.

<HEADLINE> Court Rejects Ban on Downhill Course </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Nagano District Court has
rejected a suit filed by an environmental group to ban the organizers
of the Nagano Olympic Winter Games to use the Alpine skiing men's
downhill course, court offcials said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The environmental group, joined by critics of the Nagano Games,
asked the court in December to ban the use of the starting area of the
course on the Happo-one slope in Habuba, saying the use violates the
law on the protection of national parks.
</P>
<P>
The courst ruled that the plaintiffs have no legal interest to ask
for an injunction while the plaintiffs said that would appeal to the
Tokyo High Court.
</P>
<P>
The men's downhill course has been a controversial topic between
the organizers and the International Ski Federation (FIS). FIS said
the original course was not worthy of Olympians and Nagano Organizing
Committee (NAOC), citing environmental concerns, repeatedly refused
FIS's request to raise it.
</P>
<P>
After five years of debate, a compromise solution was reached
between the two parties early in December last year. Under the
compromise, the start was raised from 1,680m to 1,765m above sea level
and the course will cut into the park at two places.
</P>
<P>
After solving the problem of the downhill course, NAOC
director-general Makoto Kobayashi said: "As an organising committee,
we have to balance the needs of the athletes with the protection of
the environment."
</P>
<P>
The NAOC has been making efforts to make the games environmental
friendly. They have already relocated venue sites because of nesting
birds, planted thousands of trees and even designed a paper plate
using waste apple pulp.

<HEADLINE> China and EU Witness Increased Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Statistics released by China's
General Administration of Customs show that China and the European
Union (EU) trade volume totalled 43 billion US dollars in 1997, up
8.3 percent on 1996.
</P>
<P>
Said figure accounted for 13.2 percent of the nation's total
foreign trade volume during the year.
</P>
<P>
China's export volume to the EU hit 23.81 billion US dollars,
up 20.1 percent on the previous year, with the import volume
rising by 3.4 percent to 19.19 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
China recorded in 1997 a trade surplus of 4.62 billion US
dollars with the EU, a region which had accounted for the major
portion of the nation's trade deficit since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Last year's trade surplus resulted from a decline in China's
imports from the EU.
</P>
<P>
The EU is an important source of machinery and electronics
products, with said products accounting for more than 70 percent
of China's imports from the region.
</P>
<P>
China's demand for imported machinery and electronics products
has dropped along with continuing improvements in the domestic
production level.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the vast majority of former preferential policies
for products imported by foreign investors expired during 1997, a
fact which led to significant reductions in related imports.
</P>
<P>
The reduced demand of such products also contributed the
to decline in imports from the EU.
</P>
<P>
The processing trade sector plays a crucial role in China's
exports to the EU. The sector exported products valued at 12.32
billion US dollars to the EU during 1997, up 24.6 percent on the
previous year's figure, with the net increase in exports standing
at 2.43 billion US dollars. The figure accounted for 61 percent of
the nation's total net increase in exports to the EU.
</P>
<P>
The export value for common trade items reached 11.24 billion
US dollars, up 15.7 percent on 1996, with the the net increase
standing at 1.53 billion US dollars. The latter figure accounted
for 38.4 percent of the nation's total net increase in exports to
the EU.

BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's financial sector will

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Tea Export Earnings Jump by 57 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's tea export earnings
jumped by 57 percent in the first half of the current 1997-98
fiscal year compared with that of the same period of the previous
fiscal year, an official source said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During the July-December period, the country earned 1.308
billion taka (28.43 million US dollars) by exporting 16.90 million
kilograms of tea while the earnings in the corresponding period of
the last fiscal year totaled 844 million taka (18.35 million
dollars) against the export of 17.12 million kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The source attributed the growth to the steep rise in tea
prices fueled by shortfall in global tea production last year.
</P>
<P>
The average price recorded in the period was 77.38 taka (1.72
dollars) per kilogram up from 49.27 taka (1.07 dollars) in the
same period of the last fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
However, the source pointed out that the country's tea output
dropped by two million kilograms in 1997 compared with the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh produced 51.5 million kilograms of tea at 156 tea
gardens in 1997, as against 53.5 million kilograms in 1996.

HOHHOT, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The rural and pastoral parts of
China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have been increasingly

The region has 191 new towns in its rural and pastoral areas,

</P>
<P>
These towns have 5,299 enterprises employing 163,000 workers,
many of which are privately or collectively owned, and mostly
engaged in food processing, wholesale and retail sales,
industrial construction and transport.
</P>
<P>
Many of their employees were former farmers or herdsmen, the

<HEADLINE> Individual Income Tax Increasing in Central Chinese City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Wuhan, capital of China's Hubei
Province, collected 200 million yuan in individual income tax in
1997, a 33 percent increase from the previous year, the local tax
bureau announced here recently.
</P>
<P>
This was proceeded by moderate economic growth for the past
five years, rapid development in the iron and steel, automobile,
mechanical, electronics, and high-tech industries, and an increase
in the number of foreign-funded firms in the city, a tax bureau
official said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 630,000 people who paid taxes, 37 percent worked for
foreign-funded enterprises or the local iron and steel company,
academy of sciences, telecommunication departments, or chemical
works.
</P>
<P>
The 11,000 owners of private firms provided another 20 percent
of last year's tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the increased tax revenues was the increased
consciousness among ordinary people of the need to pay
taxes. There was a 10 percent rate of tax evasion last year, the
official said, but that is considered somewhat small.

<P>
NAIROBI, February 4 (Xinhua)-- Secessionists on the Comoro
Island of Anjouan on Tuesday released 18 government soldiers,
the last held since the failed attempt in September to quash
the rebellion.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers were released under an agreement between the
secessionists and President Mohamed Taki's government brokered
last week by the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), said a
report reaching here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The release of these soldiers is a gesture of goodwill
towards the international community and the families of these
prisoners," said Foundi Abdallah Ibrahim, the leader of Anjouan's
unrecognized government.
</P>
<P>
Anjouan secessionists captured more than 100 government
soldiers during the failed attempt to quash the rebellion and
around 60 others died in the three days of fighting.
</P>
<P>
Secessionists on Anjouan and Moheli islands met the government

<P>
The head of the OAU's liaison bureau on the Comoros Mamoudou
Kane praised the releases as a step in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
Anjouan voted in a referendum last October to secede from the
Comoro islands on the grounds that federation has brought little
but poverty and a succession of coups since independence from
France in 1975.

Hainan's transport conditions have not been good because of
mountains in its central and western areas, greatly hindering
economic development. So, for the past several years, the island
has tried many fund-raising methods and has raised a lot of
capital for road construction.
</P>
<P>
The four-lane expressway in its western part is 366 km
long. The northern section, from Haikou, the provincial capital,
to Yangpu, is 105.7 km long and was completed last March. The
section from Yangpu to Basuo is expected to be finished later this
year.
</P>
<P>
Preparatory work on another section of the western expressway,
from Basuo to Jiusuo, 93.3 km long, is underway. The eastern part,
268 km long, was completed in late 1995. An expansion of the
northern section, from Haikou to Qionghai, started in late 1996
and is expected to be finished in March.
</P>
<P>
Work on the southeastern part, from Qionghai to Lingshui, will
soon start. The whole beltway will be completed by the year 2000,
local officials say.

BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- In today's People's Daily
China's State Education Commission reports that, during the Eighth
Five-year Plan (1991-1995) and the first two years of the Ninth
Five-year Plan (1996-2000), the country spent 1.6 billion yuan on
equipment in its normal universities and schools.
</P>

It also got 100 million US dollars in World Bank loans and 9
million US dollars from UN organizations for the same purpose.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Rejects U.S. Human Rights Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministry spokesman of
Vietnam Wednesday rejected the U.S. State Department report on
human rights, saying Washington has no right whatsoever to impose
its opinion on other countries.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said, by making groundless allegations on human
rights conditions in Vietnam, the U.S. has violated the basic
rules governing the international relations.
</P>
<P>
He added, the U.S. is in no position to make arbitration on
human rights in other nations.
</P>
<P>
At a time when the U.S.-Vietnamese relations are improving, it
is inappropriate for the U.S. to issue such a report, which not
only distorts facts, but also harms the development of bilateral
relations, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Nhan Dan, leading newspaper in the country, also carried a
commentary Wednesday, criticizing the U.S. for its attacks on
other countries on human rights conditions while keeping total
silence on its own gross breach of the matter.
</P>
<P>
In a report released last Friday, the U.S. State Department
slammed Vietnam's record of human rights.

<HEADLINE> This May Be a Hard Year for Officials Guarding China's Relics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese officials expect to be
very busy in 1998 confronting smuggling, illegal excavations, and
the theft of relics.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the Ministry of Culture said today that, since 1993,
Chinese police have investigated 4,600 crimes involving relics and
confiscated 50,000 stolen items, but many other precious items
have eluded them.
</P>
<P>
Many local officials still ignore the relics protection work
and pay attention only to the economy. As a result, nearly 1,000
relics were stolen in China last year, ministry sources say.
</P>
<P>
Chinese authorities are planning a new crackdown on these
crimes this year and will increase controls over auctioneering and
the second-hand market, sources say, and a national data base will
be built for information on relics.
</P>
<P>
This work will be especially difficult in the Three Gorges area
on the Yangtze River and the Xiaolangdi reservoir area on the
Yellow River, both of which are considered cradles of Chinese
civilization and which were dammed last year for hydro-electric
power projects.
</P>
<P>
Relics people will have to excavate and remove important sites
near the two rivers to avoid damage when the areas are
inundated. Sources say that they lack personnel and funding and
are caught in a race against time.
</P>
<P>
They will also be busy with a series of exhibitions in a year
that is the 20th anniversary of the reforms and opening up, and
the centenary of the births of several revolutionary leaders,
including Premier Zhou Enlai. Also in the works is the 50th
anniversary of the founding of New China in 1999.
</P>
<P>
There will be other items of political importance, including
the renovation of some historical sites in Yan'an, where Mao
Zedong had his headquarters in the 1940s, and Humen, where the
Opium War began in 1840.

<HEADLINE> Real Estate Sector Expects Moderate Growth By Xinhua Writer Li Jianmin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- China will provide loans
totaling 100 billion yuan during 1998 to boost housing purchases
and launch vigorous housing reform which is expected to inject
vigor into the country's real estate sector.
</P>
<P>
Construction Minister Hou Jie told Xinhua today that the
housing sector has promoted national economic development and has
emerged as a major focus of consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide apartment sales to private citizens topped 42.1
billion yuan January-October 1997, up 41.8 percent on the previous
year's period.
</P>
<P>
China constructed 300 million sq.m. of urban housing, and an
additional 650 million sq.m. in rural areas during 1997, with the
total representing the most extensive housing construction over
the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Hou said China will maintain rational and stable growth in real
estate development and investment during 1998. Real estate markets
across the nation are expected to witness further growth along
with increased sales of commodity housing. Priority will be placed
on the construction of affordable housing.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the improved macroeconomic environment
has created better conditions for real estate development
during 1998.
</P>
<P>
The government has placed high priority on solving housing
problems, an area considered to be a major factor in improving the
living standards of Chinese citizens. China has adopted a series
of favorable policies for developing the housing sector as a major
economic pillar.
</P>
<P>
Average individual spending on consumper items has grown from
around 10,000 yuan in the 1980s to tens of thousands of yuan
today, with housing emerging as a major expenditure.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that efforts to deepen and promote housing
reform by selling houses to Chinese citizens rather than
allocating housing as a material benefit will play decisive roles
in developing real estate markets.
</P>
<P>
An ever increasing number of Chinese citizens are purchasing
private housing, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks have introduced mortgage loan services as part
of an effort to stimulate housing purchases. In addition, a
nationwide fund-raising system provides assistance to individuals
interested in purchasing private housing.
</P>
<P>
Hou projected that real estate markets in large cities and
in both coastal and developed areas will be this year's top
performers, with real estate markets in small- to medium-sized
cities also exhibiting greater activity.

<HEADLINE> China's Liaoning Industrializes Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province has scored considerable achievements in industrializing
its agriculture in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
Of the 106 provincial-level projects selected for
experimentation in agricultural industrialization, 19 have been
completed while another 14 are in progress.
</P>
<P>
The incremental output value of the completed projects is
predicted at 4.7 billion yuan each year. When all the projects are
completed in 2000, the total incremental output value should hit
26.7 billion yuan, about half of Liaoning's expected total
agricultural output value that year.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that agriculture in Liaoning, China's largest
industrial center, has entered a new period of industrialization,
a period of deep processing of farm produce.
</P>
<P>
Official figures indicate that agricultural industrialization
has accounted for 30 percent of the increased income of farmers in
Liaoning. By the year 2000, 60 percent of the increased income
will result from agricultural industrialization.

<HEADLINE> Westendorp Calls for Multi-ethnic Sarajevo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The high representative of the
peace implementation council of Bosnia, Carlos Westendorp,
Tuesday urged the Bosnian authorities to turn Sarajevo back into a
multi-ethnic city.
</P>
<P>
He linked future aid to progress on the return to the city of
Serbs and Croats.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an international conference on returning refugee to
Moslem-dominated Sarajevo, Westendorp said Bosnian and Sarajevo
city leaders must enable the return of at least 20,000 pre-war,
minority residents in 1998. Otherwise the international community
would reduce financial aid to the country.
</P>
<P>
Westendorp appealed for the immediate and consistent
implementation of the amnesty law, which demands that refugees are
guaranteed not to have to serve in the army for at least five
years.
</P>
<P>
Conditions have to be created for returnee children to enjoy
full equality in Sarajevo schools, Westendorp said.
</P>
<P>
Sarajevo has to be an example of restoration of a multi-ethnic
society, the high representative added.
</P>
<P>
Robert Gelbard, special United States envoy to the former
Yugoslavia, was even more specific. He said authorities in
Sarajevo and the Muslim-Croat Federation had two weeks to change
the existing laws on property.
</P>
<P>
A failure to respect this deadline could lead to the instant
stoppage of U.S. aid for the reconstruction of Sarajevo Canton,
Gelbard added.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian tripartite presidency chairman, Alija Izetbegovic, said
he personally, and the Bosniak side, supported the initiative in
declaring Sarajevo an open city. But he dismissed criticism that
the multi-ethnic structure of Sarajevo had been dramatically
changed.
</P>
<P>
According to Izetbegovic, there are 308,000 Muslims and 45,600
Croats, Serbs and members of other nationalities living in
Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
At least one-third of the canton and city administration
employees are non-Bosnians, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian leader presented five conditions for a speedier
return of refugees to Sarajevo.--
</P>
<P>
Nobody at present living in other people's apartments should be
evicted and all those who wanted to return would not be able to
rent or sell their apartments for at least five years. A law on
returning should be adopted by the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina;
Sarajevo as the capital should become the real seat of all joint
institutions of authority and the return conditions would be
common to all groups.
</P>
<P>
"Banja Luka must follow the example of Sarajevo immediately,"
Izetbegovic demanded. Otherwise he would not accept any of the
conclusions of the Sarajevo conference.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Presidency Croat member Kresimir Zubak warned however
that the setting of new conditions was a new attempt to prevent
the return of refugees.
</P>
<P>
Zubak demanded the rescinding of illegal decisions which took
away tenancy rights from people who left Sarejevo during the war
and, for all, the unobstructed use of one's own property.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that the proclamation of a district in the area of
Sarajevo be reconsidered. This would secure equality for all
Sarajevco residents, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the conference, a declaration was passed which
obliges Bosnian authorities to amend the laws that made it
impossible for Sarajevo refugees to return to the apartments flats
where they lived before the war.
</P>
<P>
"If they (the authorities) do not comply they will be
penalized," the declaration threatened.

<HEADLINE> Bad Weather Hampers Rescue Efforts in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Bad Weather and unfavorable
environment have hindered the search and rescue efforts Wednesday
at the crash site of the ill-fated Cebu Pacific aircraft on the
mountain slopes of Mt. Sumagaya, in Misamis Oriental, Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The official Philippine News Agency quoted Henry Cinco,
spokesman of the government army, as saying that elements of the
special forces of the Philippine Air Force's emergency rescue team
are now heading toward the crash site.
</P>
<P>
He said the special forces jumped off Tuesday afternoon toward
the actual crash site but was still six hours away from the area
as of 11 a.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Cinco said the rescue team members are moving cautiously due to
slippery boulders and densely thick foliage inhabited by leeches
and dangerous insects.
</P>
<P>
He said the actual site was spotted 150 meters below the summit
of Mt. Sumagaya.
</P>
<P>
Cinco said it was impossible to drop provisions and other
support elements in the area due to steep slopes and deep gullies.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Cinco said, the weather in the area is unpredictable,
prompting some volunteers accompanying the airbone's special
forces to return to base in the morning.
</P>
<P>
He said the search and rescue teams have been regularly
informing the command center of "Task Force Pacific", a combined
search and rescue operations of the Philippines Air Force,
Philippine Army and the management of Cebu Pacific Air stationed
at the Cagayan de Oro airport, of their location and movements
every two hours.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, local television reports said that some rescuers have
already reached the crash site and found several items of the
plane wreckage and personal belongings of 104 people aboard the
plane, which crashed Monday on its way from Manila to Cagayan de
Oro.
</P>
<P>
But the reports have not been officially confirmed.

</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president of the UN General Assembly, Hennadly
Udovenko, also made a appeal in favour of the observance of the

</P>
<P>

world free of hatred and war, a world where ideals of peace, goodwill
and mutual respect form the basis of relations among countries.

<HEADLINE> Eastern China Has More Favorable Policies For Private Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, February 4 (Xinhua) -- China's Zhejiang Province,
which has the second largest group of private firms in the
country, has worked out preferential policies for its private
sector, according to Vice-Governor Lu Songting.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the new policies is to create a better
environment for private businesses in the areas of taxation,
loans, land and power supplies as well as exports to help them compete with
other companies on an equal footing, Lu says, adding that local
private companies are encouraged to use more advanced technology
and modern management.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the province had 90,000 private
enterprises, with 47 billion yuan (5.6 billion U.S. dollars) in
registered capital, second in the country after Guangdong Province, which
borders Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang also has 1.5 million individually-owned industrial and
commercial businesses, with 21.9 billion yuan in registered
capital, more than the country's average.
</P>
<P>
The growing private sector has become a major employer of
people laid off by state-owned factories and has played a big role
in local poverty-elimination efforts. So far, 839 of them have
formed a partnership with 111 impoverished villages and counties
to help them out. Some 62,000 workers who were laid off by
state-owned enterprises have found new jobs in private
business.

ISLAMABAD, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Iranian special envoy on
Afghanistan Alaeddin Broujerdi has called on all the warring
factions in Afghanistan to cease hostilities and sit across the
negotiating table to find out a peaceful solution to the war-torn
nation.
</P>
<P>
According to a local press report Wednesday, Broujerdi said

<HEADLINE> Nearly 4,000 Seek Asylum in Bulgaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, February 3 (Xinhua) - The number of asylum seekers that
have entered Bulgaria has been estimated to be from 2,000 to 4,000.
</P>
<P>
The figure was cited at a two-day workshop on Police and
Refugee Problems. The workshop opened in Sandanski, southwestern
Bulgaria, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Some 300 aliens have been formally granted refugee status by
the Bulgarian authorities.
</P>
<P>
Asylum seekers are mainly from countries strickened by armed
conflicts. As a rule, they do not carry identity papers.
</P>
<P>
There are also many persons seeking asylum who may be
associated with criminal groups that seek refugee status in a bid
to gain legal residence in Bulgaria. Though there have been few
such cases so far, past experience from other countries suggests
that an increase is possible.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria is the only country in Europe which does not yet have
a refugee law, said Hristo Ivanov of the Higher Institute for
Officer Training and Scientific Research under the Ministry of the
Interior.
</P>
<P>
A bill has been finalized and parliament is expected to pass it
before the end of this year. One of the top priorities is to
harmonize Bulgarian human rights legislation with European law.
</P>
<P>
In 1992 Bulgaria signed the convention relating to the status
of refugees and is obliged to provide decent living conditions for
people considered refugees. Officials however claim the country
cannot afford the costs, since it too is experiencing a financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees provides
financial assistance in two ways: through targeted grants to the
state itself and through aid to non-governmental organizations
implementing the refugee protection program.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Proposes Guarantee Plan to Indonesian Import </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Singapore has proposed a
multilateral guarantee plan to help Indonesia "unlock" part of its
international financial crisis, local newspapers reported on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, according to the reports, involves several
countries that would guarantee payment for Indonesian imports and
was put forward by Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong who met with
Indonesian President Soeharto in Jakarta on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Goh said that the proposal, which he discussed with Soeharto
during a meeting that lasted 95 minutes Tuesday evening, could, if
accepted, provide the Indonesian central bank with up to 20
billion US dollars in foreign guarantee.
</P>
<P>
"Letters of Credit (LCs) issued by Indonesian banks are not
being accepted by foreign banks. We have to unlock this. If we do
not unlock this, LCs are not accepted, imports cannot go in," the
Singapore leader said.
</P>
<P>
"If imports are stuck, then of course, the export industries do
not have the components for goods to be manufactured for export.
We have to find a way for LCs to be accepted," he added.
</P>
<P>
Jakarta announced last week that it would guarantee all
deposits and debts of Indonesian banks. But many foreign banks
were still not accepting their letters of credit. Analysts were
quoted as saying that even some of the big banks had been using
customer deposits to cover other obligations and delaying payment
to LC holders.
</P>
<P>
Goh reportedly said that a multilateral forum was "more
flexible". It would take a little more time to implement compared
to a bilateral agreement. But if only eight countries joined the
consortium and put up one billion US dollars each, there would be
eight billion US dollars for Indonesian imports "straight away".
</P>
<P>
"Of course, we hope that we can get something like 20 billion
US dollars," he said. And the Indonesian authorities, with central
bank reserves currently at around 20 billion US dollars, have long
said that the amount would be good for five months' worth of
imports.
</P>
<P>
Goh said that Singapore would put up a paper elaborating on the
proposal to President Soeharto soon, and wait for his decision.
"Once the president approves, we can launch," he added.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto welcomed the multilateral scheme, the reports said. He
said Australia had already agreed to guarantee Indonesian imports
of certain commodities, as had the United States.
</P>
<P>
"In reality, we have enough foreign exchange reserves to pay
for the LCs, but because there is a lack of confidence, we are
forced to finally seek help from other countries to take part in
guaranteeing the LCs," he said.
</P>
<P>
The scheme, he said, would allow Indonesia to import again and
boost its exports.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Rescuers Reach Plane Crash Site, Items Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Rescuers reached the wreckage
site of a Cebu Pacific passenger plane in a mountain area in
Mindanao Wednesday morning, and have reportedly found several
items of the plane wreckage and personal belongings of passengers.
</P>
<P>
According to local television reports, the items found in the
crash site in Mt. Sumagaya, Misamis Oriental, Mindanao, have been
sent to the Cebu Pacific Air for verification.
</P>
<P>
So far, no survivors have been found at the crash site of the
plane carrying 104 people, including five crew members, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
The passenger plane went missing Monday on a flight from the
Philippine capital of Manila to Cagayan de Oro City, Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
While air search operations were hampered Wednesday morning due
to visibility in the mountain area, ground rescuers continued
their march toward the crash site of the plane.
</P>
<P>
But government rescue teams composed of government soldiers and
the national police have reportedly clashed with members of the
rebel New People's Army.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine air force Tuesday spotted the wreckage site of
the Cebu Pacific plane on the northeast slope below the peak of
Mt. Sumagaya at an elevation of about 6,700 feet (2,043.5 meters)
above sea level.
</P>
<P>
There were conflicting reports about casualties in the air
disaster Tuesday. In the morning, the official Philippine News
Agency said that members of a non-government organization team
have found 15 survivors and 30 dead bodies in Mt. Sumagaya,
Claveria, Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
But the Cebu Pacific Air, the owner of the plane, said later
that reports about the survivors might not be true.
</P>
<P>
The mountainous area is on the flight route of the ill-fated
passenger plane which lost radio contact with the Lumbia airport
air tower while flying over the area before approaching the
airport.
</P>
<P>
The plane, which took off from the Manila Domestic Airport at
09:30 a.m. Monday, was scheduled to land in the Lumbia airport,
some 500 miles south of Manila, at about 11:00 a.m.
</P>
<P>
But the plane, which made a brief stopover in Tacloban city,
failed to arrive at the destination.
</P>
<P>
The Cebu Pacific Air, owned 49 percent by Filipino-Chinese
billionaire John Gokongwei, started operations in March 1996.
</P>
<P>
The airline is one of several new airlines established after
the Philippine government deregulated the aviation industry two
and a half years ago. It has had no previous accidents.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Parliament Approves NATO Observations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, February 3 (Xinhua) - The Bulgarian Parliamentary
Committee on Foreign Policy adopted, with an overwhelming
majority, observations on the implementation of the program for
Bulgaria's accession to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO).
</P>
<P>
The document was approved by a vote of 15 to 3, with two
abstentions.
</P>
<P>
Restructuring of the Bulgarian army, preparing the country for
its integration into the alliance and international activities
that would result in Bulgaria being invited to join NATO are the
three goals stated in the observations, said Committee Chairman
Assen Agov, MP of the Union of Democratic Forces (UDF).
</P>
<P>
The paper provides an analysis and an estimate of the
government's performance on the integration process.
</P>
<P>
Though the paper is only a working document which is not
politically binding, it, however, reflects the will of the
majority of Bulgarians for NATO membership, the chairman said.
</P>
<P>
Agov said it was extremely important to get the observations
approved before President Petar Stoyanov left for the United
States. In view of the coming high-level talks there, parliament's
approval would strengthen the president's position in defending
Bulgaria's interests.
</P>
<P>
However, the Democratic Left, the opposition party, sounded
different notes on the issue. It said Bulgaria's NATO membership
should be decided by a referendum, following a public debate.
</P>
<P>
The national debate should answer questions concerning the
current direction of NATO's development, prospects of the
deployment of military bases and nuclear weapons on Bulgarian
territory and possible participation of Bulgarian armed forces in
NATO military operations in conflict zones. It should look at the
future of the Bulgarian military-industrial complex and the cost
of bringing the Bulgarian army in line with NATO standards.
</P>
<P>
Peter Bashikarov, deputy chairman of the committee, said on
national radio: "Within the framework of cooperation with the
Euro-Atlantic structures we support Partnership for Peace.
</P>
<P>
"We are not against NATO or against expanding contacts with
this organization," he said, expressing the Left's opinion.
"However, accession to NATO is something forced upon us, which we
have never accepted."

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 3 (Xinhua)-- Iraq' representative to
the United Nations Nizar Hamdoon Tuesday reiterated that his
country did not have the missiles or any other weapons capable of
hitting Israel.
</P>
<P>
Hamdoon made the remarks while answering a question from a
listener in Israel during an interview with U.S. Cable News
Network (CNN). The listener was deeply concerned about possible
attacks on Israel by Iraq in retaliation against U.S. strikes.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq has not made such announcements," Hamdoon said, adding
that his country "has no capacity of any long-range missiles or
any other biological or chemical weapons."
</P>
<P>
"All these have been destroyed," the representative said.
</P>
<P>
Israel's concerns came after an interview by the New York Times
late last month with a head of the United Nations Special
Commission (UNSOM). The UNSCOM head alleged that Iraq still has
capacity of missiles hitting Israel and elsewhere in the region.
</P>
<P>
However, he had no evidence to prove the allegations.

WARSAW, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Polish Prime Minister Jerzy
Buzek left here for Bonn on Tuesday for a two-day work visit to
Germany.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Buzek will meet his German counterpart
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and other German political and business
figures. Invited by the German Society for Foreign Policy and the
Bonn University, Buzek will give a speech on the prospects for
Poland in an integrated Europe.

</P>
<P>
Poland values its ties with Germany and takes Germany as its
biggest and most strategic partner in foreign policy. The two

levels since they signed border and cooperative agreements, and
established friendly ties and cooperation in the 1990s.

<HEADLINE> Government Denies Wider Rich-Poor Gap in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
Wednesday denied claims of the Catholic Bishops Conference that
the "rich became richer and the poor poorer" in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement issued here, Socio-economic Planning
Secretary Cielito Habito said that the claims of the conference
recently are not supported by objective data and indicators taken
by local and external analysts.
</P>
<P>
"While the government accepts that much work remains to be done
in fighting poverty, to say that the income disparities between
rich and poor have widened is unfair," Habito said.
</P>
<P>
Income shares of the rich Filipinos have also been
redistributed towards the middle and lower income groups, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that shares of total income of families belonging to
the top 20 percent declined from 53.9 percent in 1991 to 51
percent in 1994 while those in the lower income group improved
their shares from 8.5 to 8.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Habito said that the human development index of the United
Nations Development Program indicating life expectancy, education
and gross domestic product per capita, shows an improvement in the
Philippines from 0.621 in 1992 to 0.672 in 1994, the latest
available measure for the index.
</P>
<P>
The improvement took place even at the time when the economic
growth was still below 5 percent and unemployment rate was still
higher at 9-10 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
"More recent years have in fact seen further improvement in the
indictors," he said.
</P>
<P>
Habito said that improved provision of basic social services
such as school rooms and health services should also be seen as
part of the overall package of poverty alleviation.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar, Japan Set Up Economic Cooperation Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar and Japan have reached
an agreement on establishment of an economic cooperation committee
to enhance the economic cooperation of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached here Tuesday between the Myanmar
Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Japanese Chamber of
Commerce and Industry, the official New Light of Myanmar newspaper
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The setting up of the economic cooperation committee between
the two chambers came more than seven months after a workshop on
Myanmar-Japan economic cooperation was held here last June.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Japan's investment in Myanmar
amounted to 202.63 million U.S. dollars in 16 permitted projects,
ranking the ninth out of a total foreign investment of 6.6 billion
dollars from 23 countries or regions by the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Japan, a major donor to Myanmar in the past, has extended to
the country for 18 times grant-in-aid for debt relief. The last
aid provided in June 1997 was 2 billion yen (16 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Japan has also extended to Myanmar a total grant aid
of 447,045 U.S. dollars since last November to help
implementation of agricultural and health projects in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Thai Government to Restructure Two More banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government is set to
take drastic action against two more local commercial banks which
failed to increase their capitals, the local press reported on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand is expected to announce rehabilitation
plans soon for the First Bangkok City Bank (FBCB) and Siam City
Bank (SCIB) due to their failure to recapitalize as well as their
delay in bringing in foreign partners.
</P>
<P>
The Thai central bank's move against the two medium-sized banks
will be the second round clean-up of the country's banking system.
</P>
<P>
The Thai central bank last month took over Bangkok Metropolitan
Bank whose share par value slumped to 0.01 Baht from 10 Baht.
</P>
<P>
However, what action the banking regulators will take against
FBCB and SCIB remains uncertain and some foreign banks still have
not given a definite answer on their acquisition plans for the two
Thai banks.
</P>
<P>
FBCB and SCIB reportedly have borrowed massive short-term money
from the central bank's Financial Institution Development Fund
(FIDF) to ease their liquidity crises.
</P>
<P>

<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 3 (Xinhua) -- El Nino-charged storms and
drenching rains hit the West Coast of the United States Tuesday
and Wednesday, uprooting trees, sweeping away motorhomes, breaking
windows and closing down highways in northern and southern
California.
</P>
<P>
The storm caused extensive damage and wreaked widespread havoc,
By Monday night, the storm was hitting the San Francisco Bay Area
in full force, causing power outages and shutting down roads.
</P>
<P>
Stanford University canceled classes Tuesday because of
flooding throughout the campus.
</P>
<P>
An inch-an-hour fell in many areas of Southern California
Monday. Residents were told to stay home and watch the news on
TV. Drenching rains, hail, lightning and hurricane-force winds
blasted out windows and topped trees while 18-feet waves chewed at
sand-berm protecting beach homes.

<P>
Lima, February 3 (Xinhua) ----Peru's trade deficit in 1997 was

billion dollars and exports of 6.7 billion dollars, the National
Superintendent of Customs said Tuesday.

The customs office attributed the decreasing deficit to the
rapid growth of exports, which registered an increase of 15.5
percent. The country's export volume also reached a historic
record high.
</P>
<P>
The growth is supported primarily by traditional mining and
fishing exports, which increased 58 and 23 percent respectively.

The non-traditional exports in 1997 reached 2.04 billion
dollars, up 28 percent from the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Twenty Killed in Cable Car Crash in Northern Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 3 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. Marine warplane hit and cut
a cable car line in northern Italy Tuesday, causing a cable car to
crash into the hillside with all the 20 people aboard killed.
</P>
<P>
Italy's ANSA news agency reported that the accident occurred in
Cavalese City of Trento Province in northern Italy and that the
warplane landed back at its base with the crew apparently unaware
of what had happened.
</P>
<P>
The cable car was traveling from the town of Cavalese to the
top of Cermis mountain, the site of a popular local ski resort in
northern Italy, when the warplane hit and cut the cable car line
with its tail surface, ANSA said.
</P>
<P>
Italian Defense Ministry sources in Rome said that when the
plane made an emergency landing at the NATO base at Aviano, which
is about 100 kilometers east of the scene of the accident, the
pilot reported that he had simply felt a "big bump."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Marine Ea-6b electronic warfare plane, deployed at
Aviano for service with the U.N. Stabilization Force in Bosnia,
was on a scheduled training mission in the area, the Defense
Ministry sources said.
</P>
<P>
The passengers and the car's operator aboard were killed when
it fell 80-100 meters. The victims include Germans, Belgians,
Poles and Italians.
</P>
<P>
Of those killed, nine were women and eleven were men. The
car's operator, identified as Marcello Vanzo, should have been
off-duty, but he had taken over someone else's shift at the last
moment, according to ANSA.
</P>
<P>
Senior Airman Monte Volk, a spokesman at the Aviano base, was
quoted as saying by the local media that the plane was on a
"low-level training mission" when the accident occured at 3:15 p.m.
</P>
<P>
The Ea-6b is a surveillance aircraft capable of carrying a crew
of four.
</P>
<P>
The accident drew immediate responses from political circles in
Italy.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Refoundation party renewed its call to close the
Aviano base.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, other lawmakers demanded an end to U.S. military
flights over inhabited areas, and punishment for the pilot.
</P>
<P>
Trento authorities opened an investigation into the cause of
the accident.
</P>
<P>
Italian Premier Romano Prodi sent his condolences.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton, in a phone call to Prodi,
expressed his condolences for the victims of the crash. Clinton
reportedly assured Prodi that both U.S. and Italian officials will
be fully involved in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also pledged to take steps so that no similar disasters
occur again, the Italian premier's office was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Aviano is the largest U.S. air base in Italy, with nearly 6,000
military and civilian personnel.

<HEADLINE> Castro Insists on End to Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, February 3, (Xinhua) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro
lashed out at the longstanding United States embargo against the
country on Monday and reiterated that Washington should end it as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"Cuba does not demand humanitarian aid from the United
States. It demands an end to the economic war against our people,
and that it respects our right to develop ourselves economically
and trade freely with all the people of the world," Castro said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark in a live television address to analyze Pope
John Paul II's first visit to Cuba on January 21-25.
</P>
<P>
John Paul II also condemned the embargo, saying it contributed
to hardship on the island.
</P>
<P>
During his four-hour speech, Castro criticized a recent
proposal by the Miami-headquartered Cuban-American National
Foundation to provide humanitarian aid to Cuba without dismantling
the more-than-40-year-old economic blockade of the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that the plan was an offering intended to suffocate
Cuba's economy and to diminish the honor of the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Twenty people were killed in a
cable car crash in northern Italy Tuesday, which came after a
U.S. navy warplane hit and cut the mountain cable way hanging the
cable car.
</P>
<P>
Italy's ANSA news agency reported that the accident occurred in
Cavalese City of Trento Province in northern Italy and that the
warplane landed back at its base with the crew apparently unaware
of what had happened.
</P>
<P>
Italian Defense Ministry sources in Rome said that when the
plane made an emergency landing at the NATO base at Aviano about
100 kilometers southeast of Rome, the pilot reported that he had
simply felt a "big bump."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Marine Ea-6b electronic warplane, deployed at Aviano
for service with the U.N. Stabilization Force in Bosnia, was on a
scheduled training mission in the area, the Defense Ministry
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Rescue teams sent to the area reported that the plane sliced
the cable with its tail surface, causing the car to crash into the
hillside with all the passengers and crew killed.

MADRID, February 3 (Xinhua) -- World 100 meters champion

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government Urged to Spend Less </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Bankers Association of the
Philippines (BAP) is appealing to the government to refrain from
spending more than it earns in order to help reduce interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
Fiscal restraint would be best way for the government to lead
in bringing down the interest rates in the country, according to
BAP President Deogracias Vistan, quoted Wednesday by local daily
the Philippine Journal.
</P>
<P>
Vistan said if the government, through the Department of
Finance, will not heed the call of the private financial sector to
follow this recommendation, it is likely that interest rates will
stay high.
</P>
<P>
Banks' interest rates, especially lending rates, have been
raised considerably after the de facto devaluation of the
Philippine peso in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
Vistan said that right now the interest rates continue to rise
because the Bureau of Treasury is considering the high offer of
the private financial institutions during auctions of the Treasury
Bills and Treasury Bonds.
</P>
<P>
But Vistan is optimistic that the government will be able to
cut down on its expenditures by reviewing its priorities for the
year.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has asked the
government to generate a budget surplus of 27 billion pesos (675
million U.S. dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In response, the government has instructed all government
offices to save at least 25 percent of their annual budget this
year.

<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian cities of
Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro registered in January unusual high
temperatures regarded as a result of the climatic phenomenon "El
Nino," the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
January was the hottest month of the last 42 years in Brazil,
with the medium maximum temperature reaching 30.8 degrees Celsius,
slightly below that of 30.9 degrees Celsius registered in 1956
when the Brazil National Institute of Meteorology (INMETB) started
to operate.
</P>
<P>
The medium temperature in Sao Paulo in January was
approximately 27.5 degrees Celsius, but on January 23 the city
registered a temperature of 34.2 degrees Celsius, local press
reports quoted the INMETB authorities as saying.
</P>
<P>
Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city of Brazil, registered a
temperature surpassing 40 degrees Celsius in the past three days.
The city is full of tourists and the temperature reached 41.5
degrees Celsius on February 1.
</P>
<P>
Neide Oliveira, an expert with the National Meteorological
Institute, said that there are several factors that have
influenced the change of temperatures, such as "El Nino" that
caused a rain decrease.
</P>
<P>
According to the meteorologist, the high temperature will
continue in the following days on some regions of the country.

<HEADLINE> British Farm Minister Sees Long Way for EU Farm Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Jack Cunningham, the British
agriculture minister, said Tuesday that the European Union (EU)
members still had a long way to go before they could reach
agreement on the thorny issue of farm reform.
</P>
<P>
The British minister made the remark when he addressed the
European Parliament agriculture committee in Brussels Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I doubt we'll be able to conclude them within two
presidencies. They are going to be long and complicated -- I hope
not acrimonious -- but it's going to be tough," he said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the British presidency regarded the
agricultural reform as a priority but talks had to continue after
its current half-year stewardship.
</P>
<P>
"It will probably be well into 1999 before we reach any
conclusions on the matter," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Some European Parliament members voiced concern over recent
comments by British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook over the level of spending under the annual
50 billion U.S. dollar Common Agricultural Policy.
</P>
<P>
However, Cunningham played down the United Kingdom's
free-market approach. "We don't expect CAP to be totally
dismantled, but we're not alone in wanting reform," he said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that large and small farms needed to be
economically sustainable in order to be competitive to survive,
adding that he doubted this would happen without reform.

WASHINGTON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank Tuesday
approved a 100 million U.S. dollar Contractual Saving Structural
Adjustment Loan for Uruguay to help its pension system reform.
</P>
<P>
The loan will help the government implement the pension reform
by covering part of the short-run costs and widening the set of
investment opportunities available to the privately managed
pension funds.
</P>
<P>
The loan will be used to support measures to liberalize the
investment regime of the fund administrators, increase the
availability of private securities to match the growth of those
funds, and create incentives to promote cost consciousness and
transparency in reporting by pension fund administrators.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Avoids Pledge not to Attack Iraq during </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States would
not pledge as asked for by Olympic leaders not to mount any
strike on Iraq during the Winter Olympic games.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic leaders earlier on Tuesday expressed their
concerns that the United States might destroy a U.N.-backed
"Olympic Truce" by bombing Iraq during the February 7-22 Winter
Games in Nagano, Japan.
</P>
<P>
Juan Antonio Samaranch, the International Olympic Committee
president, said in Nagano: "The IOC hopes that the Olympic truce
will be observed during the Nagano Games."
</P>
<P>
But U.S. State Department spokesman James Foley told reporters:
"All I can tell you is that we don't have timelines or deadlines."
</P>
<P>
"We respect the call for peace connected with the Olympics.
But we are working at the same time with friends and allies to
ensure Iraq's compliance with its obligations under mandatory
U.N. Security Council resolutions," Foley said at a regular
briefing.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the diplomatic efforts made by Russia, France
and Arab states to defuse the current standoff with Iraq over
weapons inspections, Foley said the United States had no
objections to these efforts, but he insisted that there could be
"no negotiation" over the U.N. demand for total access to any
sites suspected of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of diplomacy of any kind, no matter what kind of
envoys from what nations we're talking about, is simply to
achieve full compliance on the part of Saddam Hussein," he added.

<HEADLINE> Women VIPs Call for Support for Rights of Afghan Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- A panel of prominent women
today called on the international community to show its support
for Afghan women, who they say have been stripped of rights that
women around the world take for granted.
</P>
<P>
The panel of women, representing a core group of 50
internationally known women -- ministers, Nobel prize winners, as
well as politicians and intellectuals -- launched an appeal for
the women of Afghanistan Tuesday in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
The panel presented this initiative as part of a world-wide
campaign originally promoted by the European Parliament, which
includes a big variety of initiatives taken by women and human
rights organizations throughout the EU and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
The campaign is aimed at mobilizing international public
opinion on March 8 of 1998, the international women's day, around
the issue of the rights denied to the women of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The appeal calls on all member governments of the United
Nations, as well as on all international organizations, to do
whatever is in their power to help restore the basic human rights
of women in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO), which is
committed to raising public awareness about the humanitarian
crisis in Afghanistan, is supporting the campaign.
</P>
<P>
The panel includes EU commissioners Emma Bonino and Anita
Gradin.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Nuclear Ban Treaty in America's Interest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Tuesday that a treaty to ban global nuclear weapons tests "is
in America's interest."
</P>
<P>
"The test ban treaty will hold other nations to the standards
we now observe. With the treaty enforced, we will gain a powerful
new tool," said Clinton, who is visiting the Los Alamos National
Laboratory in New Mexico, the birthplace of the world's first
atomic bomb.
</P>
<P>
The visit was designed to help Clinton "speak from firsthand
experience" when he proposed a comprehensive test ban treaty to
the Senate this year, White House officials said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has submitted the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty to the
Senate for ratification, and the White House expects a difficult
battle in a drive to get it passed this year as Republicans
questioned whether the country's atomic arsenal can be properly
maintained without testing them.
</P>
<P>
To answer Republican concerns about U.S. nuclear weapons,
Clinton has proposed a package of safeguards such as expanding
intelligence, monitoring and verification of other countries'
nuclear programs to go along with the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's visit to the scientific facilities was to undercore
that the United States would still be able to maintain a safe and
reliable nuclear stockpile without detonating any weapons.
</P>
<P>
He observed a nuclear test simulation performed by the
so-called "Blue Mountain" supercomputer at the Los Alamos National
Laboratory. The lab is turning its attention from traditional
stockpile management, like underground tests, to computer-run
experiments without an explosion.
</P>
<P>
Clinton proposed in his fiscal 1999 budget 517 million U.S.
dollars for the Accelerated Strategic Computering Initiative in
which the Los Alamos lab and two others in Albuquerque and
California would be able to develop faster supercomputers and
other methods for maintaining the nuclear stockpile without
testing.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we can get the treaty ratified unless we can
convince the Senate that the stockpile stewardship program works,
that we can be secure while we try to make the world safer from
nuclear development," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The treaty has been signed by 156 countries, including nuclear
powers Britain, France, China, the United States and Russia. But
it has been ratified by only 10 states.
</P>
<P>
The United States conducted its last nuclear test in 1992, but
in 1993 Clinton extended a moratorium on underground testing.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: Attack on Iraq would Be Serious </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S Defense Secretary
William Cohen said on Tuesday that any strike on Iraq would be
more serious than ever mounted since the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
In answering questions at the Senate Armed Services Committee,
Cohen said that once decided, the attack from the formidable U.S.
force assembled in the Gulf would be aimed at "dealing him (Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein) a severe blow" to ensure he was unable
to "pose any kind of a threat to his neighbors."
</P>
<P>
He said any U.S. attack would be more concentrated and more
serious than a number of bombing and cruise missile attacks on
Iraq launched since the end of the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
"If it should come to military action, the kind of campaign
that would be undertaken would be significant. It would be far
more that what has been experienced in the past, certainly since
the Persian Gulf War," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. Republican lawmakers on Tuesday rejected Iraq's
invitation to visit Baghdad to check by themselves if there are
any weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's invitation was delivered by its U.N. ambassador on
Monday, which said U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich could lead a
congressional delegation to inspect Iraqi presidential sites for
prohibited weapons.
</P>
<P>
But Republican lawmakers said it was in vain for Saddam to try
to drive a wedge between them and President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"If he is looking for a rift between the Congress and the
president on that subject, he is not going to find it," House
Majority leader Dick Armey said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority leader Trent Lott called for decisive military
action against Saddam, saying: "If we're going to do this, let's
go all the way."
</P>
<P>
He said it was essential for the United States to have a clear
"endgame" if it proceeded with military action, and it made no
sense to put Saddam "back in his cage and then have him back out
in six months."
</P>
<P>
"Let's hit him hard, right up front," Lott said, urging strikes
to "take out" suspected chemical and biological weapons sites.
</P>
<P>
"Take out the palace guard, take out the palaces, take out
every ... target and hope that you can put one missile down in
an event or a building where Saddam Hussein is," he said.

<HEADLINE> EU, U.S. Make No Breakthrough in Helms-Burton Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 3(Xinhua) -- No breakthroughs have been made
in talks in Brussels between the United States and the European
Union (EU) on a dispute over U.S. sanction laws, it was learned
here today.
</P>
<P>
European Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan and U.S.
Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat held a 90-minute session
of talks in Brussels Tuesday, which dealt mainly with U.S. laws
that threaten to punish foreign companies doing business with
Cuba, Iran and Libya, Brittan's spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman said the talks were "constructive and
practical."
</P>
<P>
"There was no breakthrough, but on both extraterritorial
questions and the questions of expropriation, there was a useful
exchange and the discussions will continue," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added Brittan wanted to stress that there had to be progress
in parallel on both the issue of extraterritoriality and on
expropriation "for there to be a deal."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said no deadline was set for completing the
talks. "However, of course, they cannot go on indefinitely," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 Helms-Burton act calls for sanctions against any
foreign company deemed to be using property confiscated during
Cuba's 1959 communist revolution from someone who is now a U.S.
citizen.
</P>
<P>
The Iran-Libya Sanctions Act requires sanctions to be imposed
on foreign firms aiding those countries' energy sectors.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Urges Iraq to Be Flexible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz on Tuesday called on Iraq to adopt a flexible policy to
avert a military strike by the United States, according to local
TV reports.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz, who was on a visit to the Black Sea city of Rize, told
reporters that Ankara's primary objective is to eliminate the
circumstances that may lead to a conflict in the region.
</P>
<P>
"If Iraq does not take our warning into consideration, it will
lose the chance that Turkey would react to the incoming
developments," Yilmaz said.
</P>
<P>
On Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem's planned visit to
Baghdad, Yilmaz stressed that Cem would tell the Iraqi leadership
about the determination of the United States to attack Iraq if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
As the Iraqi government denied the United Nations arms
inspection team's access to the presidential palace, Washington
had voiced that it would resort to force to make Iraq give in.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that Yilmaz's remark indicated that
Ankara would extend tacit support toward a possible U.S. strike
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz, however, said that the U.S. administration had not
made any request of using the Incirlik air base in southern Turkey
which was used by Western jets during the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Turkey had already taken all measures for its
own security if a military conflict broke out between Iraq and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit had made it clear
that Turkey would not like to see a new war in the region, saying
that Turkey had suffered a lot from the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's official statistics show that Turkey had an economic
loss totaling 35 billion U.S. dollars as a result of the
U.N. embargo on Iraq which was an import trading partner of
Turkey in the past.
</P>
<P>
Cem is due to visit Baghdad Wednesday and start talks with the
Iraqi leadership Thursday on the current tense situation.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to meet with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein,
conveying to him Turkey's attitude on the issue, according to an
official statement.

<HEADLINE> Armenian President Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Armenian President Levon
Ter-Petrosyan Tuesday evening announced his resignation at the
national television, the Itar-Tass news agency reported from
Yerevan, capital of Armenia.
</P>
<P>
The president's resignation was forced by a political crisis
brought about by a clash of approaches in the Armenian leadership
to the solution of the Nagorno-Karabakh issue.
</P>
<P>
The Erkrapa group, the majority party in the Armenian
parliament, on Tuesday made a public statement in parliament,
accusing the president and the ruling party "The Armenian National
Movement", of pursuing "a defeatist policy that poses a threat to
security of both Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh."
</P>
<P>
Erkrapa leader Albert Bazeyan, who read out the statement in
parliament, declared that contradictions over the settlement in
Nagorno-Karabakh had evolved into a political crisis. In
conditions of the crisis, a realignment of party factions and
deputy groups was taking place in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Norik Petrosyan representing the communist faction announced in
parliament that participants in the numerous meetings called by
the communist party in the cities and districts of Armenia over
the past few days called for the resignation of the president and
the entire government of Armenia, their final withdrawal from the
political arena and the formation of a national salvation
government.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the current political crisis in
Armenia emerged after the presidential Security Council examined
the proposals made recently by the co-chairmen of the OSCE Minsk
conference on Nagorno-Karabkh or the settlement of the crisis over
the Armenian enclave in neighboring Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
The president and the ruling party found acceptable the
proposals tabled by Russia, the United States and France as the
co-chairs of the OSCE Minsk conference, but Prime Minister Robert
Kocharyan, who had been president of the self-proclaimed republic
of Nagorno-Karabakh until last Spring, categorically rejected the
possibility of returning to Azerbaijan the areas which were
occupied by the Karabakh troops during the 4-year-old armed
conflict with Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the president found himself robbed of support of
the "power" ministries whose leaders openly rejected compliance
with the president's policy with regard to Nagorno-Karabakh.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Tuesday, the president accepted the resignation of
mayor of Yerevan Vano Siradegyan, the head of the ruling party
"The Armenian national movement". A day before, Minister of
Foreign Affairs of Armenia Alexander Arzumanyan had stepped down.
</P>
<P>
Levon Ter-Petrosyan was elected president of Armenia on October
16, 1991.

WASHINGTON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of thousands of
customers were blacked out in southeast and west coast of the
United States Monday and Tuesday following powerful storms that were
accompanied with tornadoes across southern Florida and California.
</P>
<P>
A storm blew in from the Gulf of Mexico and moved slowly
northward, striking states along the East Coast. At least four
tornadoes hit the Miami area and another struck near Fort
Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
The storm left as many as 220,000 customers without power Tuesday
and drove ships aground. At least one person was killed.
</P>
<P>
A gust to 85 mph (136 kph) hit the Florida Keys Monday night.
Several people were injured by flying debris in Key West and a
police helicopter and two small airplanes sitting at the city's
airport were overturned by wind.
</P>
<P>
At Miami International Airport, gust to 104 mph (165 kph) was
reported Monday night, forcing a brief closure of the airport.
</P>
<P>
A second major storm struck California, blacking out more than
100,00 customers Tuesday and causing flooding that shut down Amtrak
train service along the whole West Coast and closed highways. Part
of the Napa Valley wine country was inundated and Los Angeles
streets were flooded.

BONN, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Germany's largest carmaker
Volkswagen announced Tuesday that it has delivered a total of 4.26
million vehicles worldwide last year, up 7.3 percent from the
previous record year of 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued Tuesday by the
Wolfsburg-based company, increases had been achieved in almost all
regions.
</P>
<P>
With 2.49 million vehicles delivered in Western Europe, the
Volkswagen group said it had retained the position as the region's
market leader with a market share of 17.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
In Asian-Pacific region, including Japan, demand for new
vehicles has been dampened due to financial turmoil. Nevertheless,
the deliveries of Volkswagen vehicles still rose by 11.5 percent
to 371,500 units.
</P>
<P>
In North America, Volkswagen's deliveries also jump 13.0
percent to 273,300 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
For the current year, the company was expecting further
improvement from the 1997 performance, said Robert Buechelhofer, a

<HEADLINE> Albright: US Prefers Diplomatic Solution to Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said here Tuesday that Washington still prefers a
diplomatic solution to the crisis of arms inspection in Iraq by
the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM).
</P>
<P>
"We would prefer a diplomatic solution, but if we do take
military actions, it will be significant," Albright said at a
joint press conference with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who arrived here Tuesday after visiting Bahrain, held
talks respectively with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
Moussa Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to thwart Saddam Hussein's ability to acquire and
develop weapons of mass destruction or to threaten its neighbors,"
Albright said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has barred the arms inspectors of the UNSCOM in charge of
eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction from searching
presidential palaces suspected of hiding banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
The United States has threatened to take military actions to
force Iraq to grant free access to the arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
While pressing a demand for unrestricted inspections in Iraq,
Albright gave a certain room for diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that diplomacy will convince Saddam to turn away from
his collision course with the world but we are in absolute accord
that the only standard for a real diplomatic solution is full
compliance with the Security Council and unconditional, unfettered
access for U.N. weapons inspectors," she told reporters.
</P>
<P>
She also said that the U.S. has no quarrels with the Iraqi
people and is pushing for the expansion of the oil-for-food
program.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan asked the Security Council to
double the amount of oil that Iraq can sell under the oil-for-food
deal which allows Iraq to export 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of
oil over six months to buy food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
Albright said she has "excellent discussions" with Mubarak on
all the options, which have capped meetings she has held with
U.S. allies in Europe and the Mideast region since last Wednesday
to rally support for a possible military strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Today I can report to you, the U.S., Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait,
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and the Palestinian (National) Authority
are one mind," she said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Moussa stressed that Egypt is doing its best
to channel the current tensions in the Gulf to a diplomatic
solution.
</P>
<P>
"It is very important that there will be full compliance with
Security Council resolutions, and to guarantee full cooperation
between the UNSCOM and Iraq. At the same time, diplomatic efforts
should continue ... to avoid grave consequences," he said.
</P>
<P>
Crowning the flurry of contacts among Arab leaders, Arab
League Secretary General Esmat Abdel Meguid will visit Baghdad on
Wednesday to convey a message to President Saddam from the leaders
of Arab League member states.
</P>
<P>
"He will talk with President Saddam that compliance with the
U.N. Security Council and work to avoid the grave consequences of
military options are very important. And what we need is to give
diplomatic efforts the chance to bring us back on track," said
Moussa.
</P>
<P>
Touching upon the Mideast peace process, Albright voiced
her disappointment with the 10-month deadlock in the talks between
the Palestinians and Israelis, saying it is high time for
"decision-making," instead of "hand-ringing."
</P>
<P>
Albright is on her way back to Washington at the end of a tour
which has taken her to Britain, Spain, France, Israel, the
Palestinian self-rule areas, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has opposed the use of force against Iraq and exhorted
more diplomatic efforts to defuse the tension in the region.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak held a flurry of telephone consultations with 14 Arab
leaders Monday to ensure there is a common positive Arab stand on
giving diplomacy a full chance to work on the breathtaking
developments in the Iraq-UNSCOM standoff.

of reaching a solution to defuse the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
The French envoy will discuss with Iraqi officials the
prospects of a solution of the current crisis between Iraq and the
United States, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported, without
giving further details.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, well-informed sources told Xinhua that Dufourcq will
also meet with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein Wednesday to deliver
a letter from French President Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
The letter deals with the France's views on a compromise
solution that respects Iraqi sovereignty and, at the same time,
guarantees U.N. inspectors' access to all Iraqi presidential sites
they wish to inspect, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
France has already proposed to the Iraqi authorities to allow
the U.N. Special Commission to inspect Iraqi presidential palaces
together with diplomats representing the five permanent members of
the Security Council in a move to ensure respect of Iraq's
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz has
held telephone talks with U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan on the
current crisis and diplomatic efforts to reach a solution, INA
reported.
</P>
<P>
It described the conversation as very constructive.
</P>
<P>
The agency further reported that Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi has talked over telephone with his Iraqi counterpart
Mohammed al-Sahhaf, spelling out Iran's rejection of the
U.S. threats to use force against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
On his part, al-Sahhaf briefed Kharrazi on the current efforts
undertaken by Russia and other parties to block "a U.S.
aggression" against Iraq. The two ministers agreed to keep
contacts to keep abreast with the developments of the situation.

<HEADLINE> Independent Prosecutor Presses on with White </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Monica Lewinsky, the former
White House intern who reportedly claims on tape that she had a
sexual affair with U.S. President Bill Clinton and that he urged
her to lie about it under oath, left Washington on Tuesday for
California, where her father lives.
</P>
<P>
Independent counsel Kenneth Starr's grand jury investigating
the allegations against Clinton, heard testimony on Tuesday from
another former intern, Caroline Self.
</P>
<P>
Former top White House aide George Stephanopoulos also arrived
at the federal courthouse to testify before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
Self, who worked in the office of Clinton's personal secretary
Betty Currie, was believed to have signed for packages Lewinsky
sent to the White House by courier, sources said.
</P>
<P>
Self emerged from the grand jury session to say she did not
know Lewinsky and was unaware of any affair.
</P>
<P>
"I know of no improper relationship between the president and
Monica Lewinsky or any other White House intern," reports quoted
Self as saying.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has strongly denied having an affair or urging Lewinsky
to lie.
</P>
<P>
Starr, speaking to CNN outside his office on Tuesday, said, "We
are trying to get to the truth of what would be if proven, serious
charges."
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Starr's office declined to comment on a CBS
report on Monday that Starr was leaning toward sending any
evidence against Clinton to the U.S. House of Representatives for
use in possible impeachment proceedings, rather than seeking an
indictment himself.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times reported on Tuesday that Lewinsky was
cleared to enter the White House three dozen times between the
time she left her staff job there in April 1996 to work at the
Pentagon and December 1997.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials told the Times the trips were unrelated to
her job at the press office there.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he could confirm the record of Lewinsky's visits,
spokesman Joe Lockhart said, "We have provided the information to
the independent counsel. If the independent counsel chooses to
leak the information even though that is a violation of the law,
then it's a decision he needs to make."
</P>
<P>
In a separate development, Clinton's attorney Robert Bennett on
Monday asked a federal judge in Little Rock, Arkansas, to advance
the start of the Jones sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton
to March 23 from the currently scheduled May 26.
</P>
<P>
In his motion filed with U.S. District Judge Susan Webber
Wright, Bennett said that leaks of pre-trial testimony have
continued in violation of the court's order.

<HEADLINE> UK Prime Minister Blair to Visit United States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair is to pay his first official visit to the United States
later this week.
</P>
<P>
During his four-day U.S. visit starting from Wednesday, Blair
is expected to hold talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton on
various bilateral and international issues including the
deadlocked Middle East peace process and Gulf crisis.
</P>
<P>
On the current U.N.-Iraq crisis over arms inspection, a Dowing
Street spokesman told reporters Tuesday: "We are shoulder to
shoulder with the U.S." on policy towards Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Britain, the most staunch U.S. ally in the latest Iraqi crisis,
has so far refused to rule out the possibility of using force
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Blair will also hold separate talks with International Monetary
Fund (IMF) Managing Director Michel Camdessus, American Federal
Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan and Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin during his stay there.
</P>
<P>
The Downing Street spokesman noted that Blair was keen to show
European support for IMF efforts to tackle Asia's economic crisis.

<HEADLINE> New Materials Found to Improve Cancer Therapy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli scientists at the
Weizmann Institute have developed new materials that can
significantly improve the promising cancer therapy, the
Photodynamic therapy (PDT), the institute announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the institute's spokesman's office
said the new materials were derived from chlorophyll, the green
pigment that allows plants to capture sunlight. These materials
can overcome the problems that the PDT therapy is facing in
treating bulky and solid tumors.
</P>
<P>
The Photodynamic therapy, which uses light to activate
cancer-killing drugs to destroy tumors, has generated enormous
interest in the medical world in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The therapy uses drugs that become toxic only when exposed to
light. The drug is injected into the bloodstream or the tumor,
then the tumor is exposed to light in a controlled manner so that
the drug is activated to destroy tumor cells while having little
side effects on healthy tissues.
</P>
<P>
But the PDT therapy has several limitations: it is effective
only against relatively flat and thin tumors, such as certain
types of skin and bladder cancers, and patients undergoing such
therapy must avoid the sun for weeks following the treatment
because their skin becomes overly sensitive to strong light.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, existing light-sensitive materials used clinically as
PDT drugs are most commonly based on heme, the red pigment
derived from hemoglobin. They are activated only by visible
light, which has limited tissue-penetrating capacity. And they
work only in the presence of oxygen, which is in short supply
inside many bulky tumors. Thus, current PDT therapy can destroy
only flat and thin tumors.
</P>
<P>
But the new "green" materials, developed by Professor Avigdor
Scherz of the Plant Sciences Department and Yoram Salomon of the
Biological Regulation Department, may make it possible to apply
PDT to bulky and solid tumors and the patients need to avoid the
sun for only a day or two after treatment.
</P>
<P>
These materials can absorb not only visible light, but also
near-infrared light that penetrates much deeper into body
tissues. And they can also work under hypoxic conditions, where
oxygen levels in tissues are below normal.
</P>
<P>
In order to deliver the "green" materials precisely to the
desired site, the scientists can attach them to antibodies, or
other molecules, that act as "guided missiles," transporting the
materials to the targeted place. When illuminated, the materials
will first destroy the blood vessels that feed the tumor, thus
killing the tumor.
</P>
<P>
Clinical tests on mice have proven to be very successful, and
the scientists will soon begin testing them in humans.
</P>
<P>
"If successful, in the future, our 'green' PDT could be a
powerful new tool in the struggle against cancer," Scherz said.
</P>
<P>
The release said that the Dutch company Steba Beheer NV is now
developing the materials for clinical use worldwide. The company
will soon begin having clinical trials worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Deputy PM Opposes US Military Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Deputy Prime Minister
Bulent Ecevit said Tuesday that any use of force by the United
States in ending the current Iraqi crisis would be proof of the
failure of Washington's policies in this region, the semi-official
Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Istanbul, the largest city of Turkey,
Ecevit warned that Turkey might face a fait accompli situation
regarding any eventual use of the Incirlik air base in Adana,
southern Turkey, by the U.S. forces to strike on Iraq, saying that
Turkish officials should be prudent and cautious on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. fighter jets took off from the Incirlik base and
bombarded northern Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has so far received no request from the U.S. to
use the air base in southern Turkey to stage strikes against
Iraq to end the current the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
Referring to reports that the U.S. did not welcome Turkish
Foreign Minister Ismail Cem's visit to Baghdad, Ecevit
said: "Turkey's initiative is not America's or any other country's
business. Cem's visit (to Baghdad), as you know, was approved by
the U.N. Secretary General (Kofi Annan)...The United States
should take into account Turkey's initiative."
</P>
<P>
Cem will go to Baghdad Wednesday noon to send a message
of Turkish President Suleyman Demirel to Iraqi leaders in a
bid to contribute to a solution to the crisis.
