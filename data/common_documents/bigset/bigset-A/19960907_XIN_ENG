<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Lebed Forms Union As Power Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Allies of Russian security
chief Alexander Lebed have formed a new political union -- known
as "For Truth and Order" -- which will serve as a power base for
Lebed outside the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
The new union brings together Honor and Motherland, an
organization of retired soldiers founded by Lebed himself, the
Democratic Party of Russia and the Congress of Russian
Communities, on whose ticket Lebed ran in last December's
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Yury Popov, head of Honor and Motherland, told reporters at the
founding ceremony on Thursday that the creation of the union was
Lebed's idea.
</P>
<P>
"We coordinated our actions with his request and desire to
establish this union," he said.
</P>
<P>
The first task of the union, according to its leaders, is to
support Lebed's efforts for a political settlement of the Chechen
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said the final results of the Chechen settlement
might decide the political future of Lebed. He is expected to
prepare for running for the Kremlin top post at the end of this
century or the beginning of the next.
</P>
<P>
Lebed's popularity was largely boosted after his peace mission
in Chechnya produced a peace plan on August 31, which got the
approval of President Boris Yeltsin on Thursday, with a few
objections.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that should Yeltsin leave the top post in
the Kremlin, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Lebed, who ran
third in the summer presidential elections, would be prime
candidates to succeed.
</P>
<P>
They also said that Lebed's move to found his own party was
expected.
</P>
<P>
In "For Truth and Order," Lebed has created a vehicle to
promote his own agenda and political career.
</P>
<P>
Honor and Motherland claims to have branches in 63 of Russia's
89 regions. The Congress of Russian Communities boasts 65 regional
branches, while the Democratic Party of Russia has 69 branches.
</P>
<P>
In the long term, and especially if Lebed finally decides to
make a run for the presidency, the regional branch organizations
controlled by "For Truth and Order" could form the basis for a
nationwide campaign.

<HEADLINE> FIFA to Examine Chilavert Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The International Football
Federation (FIFA) is to seek further details about a 13-month ban
from Argentine soccer imposed on Paraguay captain Jose Luis
Chilavert by a judge this week.
</P>
<P>
The goalkeeper was additionally given a three-month suspended
jail sentence for punching a stadium assistant during a match
between his Velez Sarsfield club and Gimnasiay Esgrima de la Plata
in April 1994.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from anything else, he's from Paraguay and is playing
in Argentina which makes it an international issue," a FIFA
spokesman said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chilavert, who scored from a free-kick against Argentina to
clinch a draw for Paraguay in a World Cup qualifier in Buenos
Aires on Sunday, has claimed he is being victimised because of
his nationality.
</P>
<P>
"They can't forgive me my success because I'm Paraguayan, but I
feel more proud of that than ever," he said.
</P>
<P>
Regarded by some as the best goalkeeper in the world, Chilavert
helped his club win Argentina's last championship, saving a
penalty in the match that clinched the title.

<HEADLINE> Display Of Mao-Dalai Lama Letters In Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A reply to the 14th Dalai Lama
written by the late Mao Zedong, and a paean to Mao titled "Ode to
Mao Zedong", written by the Dalai Lama are just two of the items
on display during the 13th International Congress on Archives.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the public have had access to these
documents.
</P>
<P>
In the letter which was written on November 24, 1955, Mao
reminisces about the "pleasant time" he had with the Dalai Lama
during a meeting in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
The late chairman said in the letter that "China is a big
country, but neither rich nor powerful. However, after
several 'five-year plan' periods, China was expected to become a
powerful and affluent country, with the combined efforts of people
of all nationalities."
</P>
<P>
In his ode to Mao, the Dalai Lama said that the cause of the
Chinese revolution, led by Mao, is a great cause that liberates
people of various nationalities from "darkness and suffering," and
that Mao is "a big brave roc fighting the imperial poisonous
snake," and that the cause of Tibet and its peaceful liberation
will cover "heaven, hell and the earth."
</P>
<P>
A deputy curator of the Archives under the Tibet Autonomous
Region said the Dalai Lama maintained close relations with the
central government in the past, and that he hopes the Dalai Lama
will repent and return to the embrace of the motherland.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Public Servants Spied for CSIS, Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Canadian public servants at all
levels of government have acted as secret informants for the
Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), local newspapers
reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Newly declassified documents show public officials working for
federal, provincial and municipal government have quietly provided
CSIS with information over the years," the Ottawa Citizen
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
It is believed to be the first official confirmation that the
intelligence agency relies on confidential sources in public
service ranks, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
The revelation, contained in a report by the public watchdog on
CSIS, raises questions about the type and number of government
departments involved, and what sort of information the sources
have passed to the intelligence service, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The report, by the Security Intelligence Review Committee, says
the use of federal public servants as sources is guided by a set
of directions from the solicitor general approved in October 1986.
It covers employees of most federal departments and agencies.
</P>
<P>
CSIS is responsible for advising the federal government about
threats to national security -- from political violence by
right-wing racists to a potential threat by a foreign power, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
But it has no authority to probe organizations such as lobby
groups or unions engaged in legitimate political dissent.
</P>
<P>
"There is often a fine line between a security threat and
justifiable political activity," said Reg Whitaker, a York
University professor who studies the world of spies.
</P>
<P>
"It raises the question of whether public servants are giving
information to CSIS about Quebec separatism or aboriginal
political organizations," the Gazette newspaper quoted him as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The review committee began the report after it became known in
1992 that former Parti Quebecois cabinet minister Claude Morin had
been a paid informant for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)
Security Service between 1974 and 1977, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspapers, although significant portions of
the top secret report have been withheld, "it clearly indicate
that public service sources at various levels of government had
provided 'valuable information' to CSIS."
</P>
<P>
The CSIS spokesman would neither confirm or deny whether the
service currently has sources in government ranks. But he
acknowledged that the 1986 policy on federal sources is "still in
place," the newspapers noted.

<HEADLINE> Alliance for Africa's Industrialization Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A three-day high-level
experts meeting on the Alliance for Africa's Industrialization
opened here today to pave the way for its establishment later
this year.
</P>
<P>
In his written speech to the opening ceremony of the meeting,
Dr. K.Y. Amoako, UN Under-Secretary General and ECA Executive
Secretary, stressed the importance of agro-industry in Africa's
development.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''development experience has clearly shown that those
countries which were or are successful in industrialization were
also simultaneously successful in agriculture.''
</P>
<P>
''The Alliance for Africa's Industrialization is therefore
right to focus on agro-industries development where Africa has a
huge potential,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Amoako asked the alliance to focus on the manufacturing of
agricultural machinery, tools and equipment for farming; on the
manufacturing of machinery and equipment for commodity
processing, product packaging and storage; and on the
establishment of fertilizer industries.
</P>
<P>
The concept of the alliance was presented by the director
general of the U.N. industrial development organization (UNIDO)
to the first meeting of the bureau of the 12th meeting of the
conference of African ministers of industry held in Pretoria,
South Africa from April 25 to 26, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Then, a consultative meeting of chief executives of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), UNIDO and the U.N. Economic
Commission for Africa (ECA) held during the OAU summit in
Yaounde, Cameroun from July 3 to 5 and decided to hold this
experts meeting in Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of the alliance is to strengthen the efforts
of Africa's industry to increase its productivity and
international competitiveness, and to expand its production
capacity in line with emerging demands at the domestic, regional
and international markets.
</P>
<P>
The alliance will be formally launched in Abidjan, Cote
d'Ivoire from October 21 to 23, this year.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the OAU, UNIDO and the Ethiopian
government also spoke at the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting will identify and prepare priority
programs and projects at national and regional level. It will
also prepare plan of action and provisional agenda for the
launching of the alliance in Abidjan in October.

<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's state radio
today announced the banning of two independent tabloids, the New
Light and Torchlight, saying they were not granted the permission
to publish.
</P>
<P>
However, the radio report gave no further details.
</P>
<P>
A front page article had been carried by today's version of
Torchlight, titled "Who Stole 150 Million Leones From Bank of
Sierra Leone", which clearly referred to President Ahmed Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
"That may explain why," said a local journalist.
</P>
<P>
Under the former military government, newspapers had to
register with the Ministry of Information and pay one million
U.S. Dollars, and the publisher of the paper must own an asset
worth six million U.S. Dollars. However, the decree was rescinded
when Kabbah's civilian government took power in March this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Association of Journalists, the two papers
were ordered to cease publication with immediate effect, thus
reducing the number of newspapers in the west African country
from 33 to 31, mainly published on a weekly basis.

TUNIS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The 7th Arab Surgeons'

</P>
<P>
The conference was organized by Arab Surgeons' Association and

</P>
<P>
The four-day conference discussed some 200 research papers on
organ transplantation, wound inflammations, and the latest
developments in surgery science.
</P>
<P>
It also underlined the importance of drawing up an all-round
strategy for the Arab world to prevent post-surgery inflammations,
noting that such cases drain "the financial and productive
capabilities of patients."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the conference called for using the classical Arabic
language in future conferences because communication between
eastern and western Arab experts was difficult due to different
dialects they speak.

KAMPALA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Iranian President
Ali Hashemi Rafsanjani today urged Ugandan Moslems to unite and
build the country and love each other.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when meeting with Moslem leaders at the

<HEADLINE> Frenchmen Sensitive about Poverty, Exclusion: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The fight against poverty and
social exclusion is considered by Frenchmen and Frenchwomen as the
second most important issue of the country after unemployment,
said a poll published by the newspaper "Le Croix" today.
</P>
<P>
The poll was conducted by the SOFRES polling group on August
28-30 on 1,000 people who are above 18 and from different social
groups.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-one percent of people aged between 18 and 24 say that
they think about poverty and exclusion from time to time, while 34
percent of people above 66 say that they never think about
poverty.
</P>
<P>
Only 9 percent of the members of working class say they never
think about poverty and exclusion.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-two percent of the polled say they personally know
someone who is living in poverty or is in the danger of falling
into poverty. Six years ago, 49 percent of Frenchmen said they
knew personally someone who was living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-two percent of people say that to have five million poor
people in France is something unacceptable, while 20 percent say
that they feel "disarmed and powerless" in front of the problem
of poverty.
</P>
<P>
Ninety-four percent of the Communist Party members polled say
the state has not done enough for the poor, while most of the
members of rightist groups and Catholic communities say the
opposite.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-three percent people say that unemployment of long
duration is the principal cause of poverty, followed by the lack
of development of job market, and lack of solidarity among people
as other causes of poverty.

<HEADLINE> Russia Claim Millions of Dollars Lost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Russia has lost tens of
millions of U.S. dollars because of the U.S. missile trikes
against Iraq, a senior Russian diplomat said today.
</P>
<P>
Igor Bukharov, head of the Russian Foreign Economic Relations
Ministry's Department for Asia, Africa and Latin America, told
the Interfax news agency that the implementation of the U.N.
resolution on supplies of food and medicine to Iraq for two
billion dollars proceeding from the sale of oil has suspended
following the U.S. air strikes on Baghdad and its outskirts.
</P>
<P>
As a result over 10 Russian companies lost lucrative
contracts, he added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that major foreign trade companies and well-known
Russian firms that have been maintaining ties with Baghdad and
enjoying certain privileges in Iraq lost profits due to the U.S.
actions.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he pointed out, the latest developments in Iraq
may further delay the lifting of economic sanctions against
Baghdad, and Russia will lose more profits.
</P>
<P>
According to Bukharov, Russia is prepared to launch a series
of large-scale industrial projects in Iraq worth a total of 10
billion dollars after the sanctions are lifted.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has asked Russia to participate in the reconstruction of
its oil industry, the construction of power-generating
facilities, a steel plant with an annual capacity of two million
tons and plants for the production of methanol and caustic
salt, he said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria' Strategy on Oil Spillage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A first ever national plan has
been formulated by Nigeria's Oil Spill Continency Committee to
confront major oil-spill incidents in the oil-rich west African
country.
</P>
<P>
"The national strategy is most desirable and timely when
petroleum exploration and production are aggressively being
carried out, huge amount of money are being lost and the
environment are being damaged," Dan Etete, Minister of Petroleum
Resources said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The plan, first of its kind since the commercial exploration
of crude oil began in Nigeria in 1958, is still waiting to be
approved by the government, according to a report by the official
News Agency of Nigeria today.
</P>
<P>
Details of the plan are still to be revealed.
</P>
<P>
Up to date over 4,000 oil wells have been drilled in both
onshore and offshore areas of Nigeria, with current production
standing at over two million barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
With the development of the petroleum industry, accidental oil
spillage have also been occurring. Statistics show that over
3,000 oil spill incidents were recorded in the country between
1976 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
These incidents have led to the loss of more than two million
barrels of crude oil, which is worth nearly 40 million U.S.
Dollars at the present price, when oil is spilling at random into
land, swamp and offshore marine environments, said Jerry Nwankwo,
Chairman of the committee.

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A military helicopter
supporting U.S. President Bill Clinton's campaign in Florida
crashed and was destroyed by fire today, a White House spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
The Marine Corps Chinook helicopter went down about 11:40 a.m.
(1540 GMT) at Florida's Orlando Executive Airport. Clinton was
being driven to an appearance at Valencia Community College at the
time of the accident, White House spokesman Mike McCurry, who was
accompanying Clinton on his visit, said.
</P>
<P>
The four helicopter crew members suffered minor injuries. One
witness said the helicopter hit a light pole and turned on its
side on takeoff.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said the helicopter, which was usually transporting
reporters traveling with the president, was on its way from Miami
enroute back to its base at Quantico, Virginia. No civilians were
aboard the craft at the time of the accident.
</P>
<P>
It was the second such accident in a month. Last month, a C-130
military transport airplane carrying eight people crashed, killing
all aboard as it returned from Wyoming, where Clinton had been
vacationing with his family.

<HEADLINE> UN Concerns Insecurity of Serbs in Eastern Slavonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Spokeswoman of the U.N.
liaison office in Belgrade Susan Manuel said Friday that a feeling
of insecurity has been increasing among Serbs living in the
Eastern Slavonia in northeastern Croatia.
</P>
<P>
They are feeling insecure because they do not know what to
expect in the future, Manuel said at a press conference in
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The Serb-dominated Eastern Slavonia is the only part of the
self-proclaimed Republic of Serb Krajina in Croatia that remains
in the Serb hands. The normalization of relations between
Yugoslavia and Croatia last month has confirmed that the region
bordering Yugoslavia is the territory of Croatia, dashing hope of
the Serbs in the region to join Serbia some day in the future.
</P>
<P>
The region was placed last January under a one-year U.N.
administration with possibility to extend the term for anther year
under an agreement reached between the Croatian government and the
Serb leaders in the region last November.
</P>
<P>
As regards the elections in the Eastern Slavonia region, Manuel
said they could be held next February or March, provided that
amnesty and citizenship issues be resolved by mid-November.
</P>
<P>
She underlined that the agreement on the normalization of
relations between Yugoslavia and Croatia points to the need for
proclaiming general amnesty for all persons who had taken part in
the war conflict in Croatia, except for war crimes suspects.
</P>
<P>
The amnesty law adopted by Croatia a few months ago refers only
to Serbs from Eastern Slavonia, but not to those from the western
parts of the Republic of Serb Krajina that was set up by the Serbs
in 1991 when Croatia was breaking away from the former Yugoslav
federation. The Serb republic was dissolved after Croatian
government troops launched offensives to recover the Serb-held
regions last year, forcing 250,000 Serbs to flee their homes.

<HEADLINE> PA Chief Negotiator Vows To Create Palestinian State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Saeb Erekat, Palestinian
chief negotiator, said today that only the Palestinians will
decide whether a Palestinian state will be established, reported
Israel Television.
</P>
<P>
Erekat, who is also Palestinian Authority's Minister of Local
Government, told reporters in Gaza that without a Palestinian
state there will be no real peace.
</P>
<P>
Erekat made the remarks in reaction to Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's statement on the issue of Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
"There never will be a Palestinian state between the
(Mediterranean) Sea and the Jordan (River)," Netanyahu pledged
before the Likud Central Committee meeting held in Tel Aviv
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu contended that (former Labor Prime Minister) Shimon
Peres and (Oslo Accords architect) Yossi Beilin had promised (PA
President Yasser) Arafat a Palestinian state in 90 percent of the
(occupied Palestinian) territories.
</P>
<P>
But he challenged, "I have new tidings for Peres. You can dream
every night for the four years of our term, but you will wake up
each morning to realize that there is no Palestinian state,
contrary to your predictions. There really is a new Middle East,
and in it there is not and never will be a Palestinian state."
</P>
<P>
Appearing on Israel Radio earlier Thursday, Peres said that if
the pressure was intense enough, Netanyahu would agree to the
establishment of a Palestinian state, as he agreed to a meeting
with Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
"The first thing that happened is that the Likud recognized
the PLO and the head of the PLO," Peres said.
</P>
<P>
"The (concept of) 'Greater Israel' is over. It doesn't exist
anymore. The prime minister said that negotiations must be held on
the delimitation of authority, and the delimitation of the
territory. That means that there will be areas that will not be
ours, and authority that won't be ours," he added.
</P>
<P>
Dealing with secret talks with Israel prior to the
Netanyahu-Arafat summit, Erekat said that the Palestinian side had
not agreed to make changes in agreements reached with Israel.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Arafat is scheduled to travel to
Cairo Saturday to brief President Hosni Mubarak on his landmark
meeting with Netanyahu.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Reserves Right to Resist, Says Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A joint meeting of Iraq's
Revolutionary Command Council and the Arab Baath Socialist Party
leadership was held here Thursday night, expressing the country's
reservation of right to resist aggression, informed sources said
today.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein presided over the joint
meeting, which dealt with the situation in Iraq after the
U.S. missile strikes and U.S. President Bill Clinton's
announcement on the end of the military action against Iraq, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
"We can not deem the U.S. announcement true and serious unless
the U.S. warplanes stop violating the Iraqi airspace and
threatening our sovereignty and territorial integrity," the
sources quoted a statement issued after the meeting as saying.
</P>
<P>
"As far as the U.S. violations continue, we consider the
U.S. aggression continuing. We reserve our right to resist such
an aggression as we have the right to self-defense and defending
the national sovereignty," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here expressed concern about the potential
confrontations between Iraq and the United States due to Iraq's
refusal to recognize the newly-expanded no-fly zones below the
33rd parallel in south Iraq and above the 36th parallel in north
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq opposed also the patrolling flights of U.S. and British
fighter planes in the Iraqi airspace.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi man-in-the-street is concerned about the future of
Iraq under the existing conditions as the destiny of the
U.N.-Iraqi oil-for-food deal is shrouded in mystery after the
United States froze its implementation.

<HEADLINE> EU Determined to Step Up Efforts to Combat Sexual </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The European Union(EU)
announced today in a declaration that it intends to press ahead
firmly with its concerted action and cooperation aimed at putting
a stop to the commercial sexual exploitation of children.
</P>
<P>
The EU said that it welcomes the outcome of the World Congress
Against the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children, held in
Stockholm from 27 to 31 last month.
</P>
<P>
It noted with approval the decision of the host country,
Sweden, to ask the United Nations Secretary-General to have the
Stockholm Declaration and Agenda for Action circulated to all UN
member countries, calling this "a first step in putting into
practice the commitments entered into in Stockholm".
</P>
<P>
At the forthcoming proceedings of the 51st session of the
United Nations General Assembly, it said, the EU will strive for
the implementation of the recommendations adopted in Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
The EU stated that it will continue its efforts to have traffic
in human beings made a criminal offence internationally.
</P>
<P>
It also said in the declaration that EU Ministers for Justice
and Home Affairs, meeting within the Council in Dublin on 26 and
27 September 1996, will seek to step up police and judicial
cooperation in acting to combat the commercial sexual exploitation
of children.
</P>
<P>
Measures could be taken under the European Convention and by way
of special new cooperation instruments, it added.
</P>
<P>
In addition to this action, according to the declaration, the
EU is also conscious of the need to provide physical and
psychological support for the victims of such outrages and to
promote their recovery and re-integration in accordance with the
Declaration adopted in Stockholm.

<HEADLINE> UK Retail Sales Surge to 8-Year High in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Retail sales in Britain are
more buoyant than at any time since the consumer boom of 1988, but
there is no need for higher interest rates, according to a latest
business survey from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI).
</P>
<P>
The CBI's survey of 15,000 outlets in retailing, wholesaling
and the motor trade, published Thursday, showed that two thirds of
retailers said sales were higher in August than in the
corresponding month last year. Only one in seven said they were
lower.
</P>
<P>
This is the healthiest reading since November 1988, and the CBI
said that the outlook was expected to remain bright for at least
another three months.
</P>
<P>
The Sales increase is prompting retailers to create more jobs.
Employment growth in August was at its highest level since 1989.
</P>
<P>
But the survey also indicated that retailers took advantage of
an increase in consumer spending to push up their prices. More
than half said prices were higher than a year before, the highest
level since May 1993.
</P>
<P>
However, the CBI shrugged off suggestions that this trend could
create higher inflation, saying that the price increases were
reflecting cost increases going back some months and were very
modest.
</P>
<P>
With manufacturing and export demand still weak, the CBI
insisted that there was no need to raise interest levels from
their present level of 5.75 percent.

WASHINGTON, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Hurricane Fran turned into
a tropical storm as it was moving north today after striking
coastal areas of North and South Carolina Thursday night, killing
at least 12 people.

WASHINGTON, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Susan McDougal, whom a
federal judge in Arkansas found in contempt of court Wednesday,
said today that she decided on her own, without any urging from
the White House, to go to jail rather than testify before a grand

</P>
<P>
The federal judge on Wednesday ordered Mrs. McDougal to talk to

until the grand jury disbands.

boarding a flight for Los Angeles. "It has to do with Susan
McDougal."
</P>
<P>
She said prosecutors had abused and harassed her in an effort
to obtain incriminating information against the Clintons, who were
partners with her and her ex-husband James in the Whitewater land
development in northern Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
"Those people have been so dishonorable with me," McDougal
said. "What fool do they think I am at this point?"
</P>
<P>
She was sentenced to two years in prison after being convicted
of misusing a 300,000-dollar loan. Prosecutors said 25,000 dollars
of the loan was used as the down payment for 810 acres purchased
by the Whitewater Development Corp. in central Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors want to know whether Clinton knew about the loan or
the acreage. He testified at Mrs. McDougal's trial that he did
not.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. McDougal's attorney, Bobby McDaniel, said he had had no
contact with the White House regarding her refusal to testify.
"The White House is not pulling my strings," McDaniel said.

<HEADLINE> France to Raise Tax on Alcohol,Tobacco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- France will raise taxes on
alcohol and tobacco products and will use the extra money to
finance social security projects, said Minister of Economy and
Finances Jean Arthuis today.
</P>
<P>
Arthuis, who justified the decision by linking alcohol and
tobacco consumption to health problems, did not give the exact
figures of the increases, but said they would be "high".
</P>
<P>
He said that the government expected a 1.3 percent growth of
the gross national product in 1996, and a 2.3 percent growth in
1997.
</P>
<P>
The public deficit would be contained below 288 billion francs
(about 58 billion U.S. dollars) this year.
</P>
<P>
The government announced Thursday evening that it would reduce
income taxes by 25 billion francs (5 billion dollars) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, it would raise tax on social contributions by 7
billion francs (1.4 billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> Somalis Delighted as Commodity Prices Drops in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Ordinary families in the
Somali capital of Mogadishu are delighted as the prices for food
and other commodities have been dropping sharply due to the
depreciation of the U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
A 50 Kg sack of flour has lost its value from 21 U.S. Dollars
to 16 U.S. Dollars. The Price of Spaghetini, popular food for
southern Somalis, has dropped from 11.6 Dollars to 7.25
Dollars. The prices of rice and flour have also dropped sharply.
</P>
<P>
This was largely attributed to the loss of value of the U.S.
Dollar which has now sank to a historical low of 7,600 Somali
Shillings.
</P>
<P>
The depreciation of the U.S. Dollar began since the
international community abandoned Somalia in March 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to Muhsin Ali, a well known businessman in the main
Bakara market, all business people have forwarded their hard
currency in cash for exchange of the local Somali Shillings
before the U.S. Dollar looses its value. During the 1993-94
period, the dollar had gone down to 3500 Shillings.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the sharp decrease of the important food
items is the presence of two vessels carrying 12,000 tons of
sugar, 2,000 tons of flour and 3,000 tons of rice at the EI-Ma'an
Port, 30 km north of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time such a huge stock of food comes in
Mogadishu for sales for the last three months. enditem

<HEADLINE> Romanian Sailors Hold Cargo Ship at Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-four Romanians are
holding a cargo ship in custody at Beira, a port city of
Mozambique, demanding its owners to pay their eight months'
salaries in arrears, the Mozambique News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The vessle, belonging to the company Ritz Rom Marine based in
Constanta, Romania, arrived at Port Beira on August 16 from
Madagascar and was to carry 5,000 tons of maize from the port to
Cape Verde.
</P>
<P>
However, the crew in the ship stopped all the work because the
ship owners had not paid them for eight months. The sailors said
that they would quit their jobs and go back home after the owners
paid their salaries in arrears.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the owners have promised to pay half of
the arrears on condition that the sailors should continue their
work.
</P>
<P>
But the sailors said that they cannot accept the
precondition imposed by the owners, adding that they will
continue to detain the ship until their demands are met.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Hiring People off Welfare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Campaigning in Florida for
a second day, U.S. President Bill Clinton urged the nation's
churches Friday to help a welfare overhaul by hiring people off
the public rolls.
</P>
<P>
"Will you do that?" Clinton implored the National Baptist
Convention USA, representing 33,000 churches.
</P>
<P>
"Will you go home and consider hiring somebody from welfare to
work if your state will give you some money to help you do it?"
The Associated Press quoted Clinton as saying.
</P>
<P>
The new welfare law, which Clinton signed last month, requires
recipients to find jobs within two years, gives states the option
of offering welfare money to employers as an incentive for hiring
people off welfare, Clinton said. "You could make all the
difference in the world" and set an example for businesses, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The welfare bill ends a six-decade guarantee of federal help
for the needy and mandates a five-year cap on benefits to
families.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that "to make that morally defensible and
practically possible, there has to be work for those people to
do."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he wasn't taking anyone's vote for granted, adding
"We know the only poll that counts is the one they take on
November 5. I ask you to remember that and help others remember it
as well."
</P>
<P>
Wrapping up a two-day campaign swing through traditionally
Republican Florida Clinton trumpeting good economic news: the
announcement of a 5.1 percent unemployment rate in August, the
lowest in seven years.
</P>
<P>
"The American economy, my fellow Americans, is on the right
track and we need to keep it going in the right direction," news
reports quoted Clinton as saying.
</P>
<P>
Before returning to Washington, Clinton was scheduled to stop
in Panama City in the Florida Panhandle.
</P>
<P>
It has been 20 years since a Democratic presidential candidate
won Florida and its 25 electoral votes. Clinton got only 39
percent of the vote here four years ago against George Bush.

<HEADLINE> UK Diplomat in Porn Case Gets 3 Years in Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 6 (Xinhua) - A British diplomat convicted of
smuggling more than 100 of child pornography from Japan was
sentenced today to three years in jail.
</P>
<P>
Robert Coghlan, 54, who spent 30 years in British Embassies
abroad, was shocked and bowed his head as the judge passed the
sentence.
</P>
<P>
Gerald Butler, Judge at Southwark Crown Court in London said "I
am satisfied beyond doubt that you always knew that large number
of these video cassettes involved the exploitation, abuse and
degradation of children."
</P>
<P>
"If it were not for men such as you to provide a market for
this filth, there would be no incentive for others to manufacture
and sell them for their own profit," the judge added.
</P>
<P>
Coghlan bought much of the paedophile material while serving as
first secretary in the information department at the embassy in
Tokyo, prosecutor Nigel Lithman said during his trial yesterday.
</P>
<P>
It was told that Coghlan was still busy building up his illicit
video collection when he helped the Princess of Wales around Tokyo
during a visit to Japan in February last year.
</P>
<P>
Customs investigators said he was part of a secret
international paedophile network. They described the videos as
among the worst they had seen.
</P>
<P>
Coghlan is believed to be the first British diplomat to be
found guilty of smuggling pornographic material. Butler said he
presumed the verdict would mean an end to Coghlan's diplomatic
career.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Foreign Office said "disciplinary action
will be taken" but would not comment further.

<HEADLINE> US Fighters Violate North, South Iraqi Airspace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi radars detected 16
flights by U.S. warplanes and an AWACS (airborne warning and
control system) reconnaissance aircraft violating the Iraqi
northern airspace from the Turkish territories, an Iraqi military
spokesman said this evening.
</P>
<P>
"The United States carried out 64 flights by fighter planes
and an AWACS violating the Iraqi southern airspace from the
Kuwaiti and Saudi territories," the Iraqi News Agency quoted the
spokesman as also saying.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi air defense system was not able to encounter or
shoot down any of the U.S. aggressive planes, the spokesman
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The recent U.S. action follows the U.S. decision on the
expansion of the "no-fly" zone from the 32nd parallel to the 33rd
parallel in south Iraq. It also follows Iraq's refusal to
recognize the "no-fly" zones, one below the 33rd parallel in
south Iraq and the other above the 36th parallel in north Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The United States threatened to launch further missile strikes
on Iraq in case the latter's air defense challenged the
U.S. decision.

<HEADLINE> New Car Sales in Britain Up 2.2 Percent in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 6 (Xinhua) -- New car sales in Britain last
month rose by a disappointing 2.2 percent year-on-year, below
car makers' expectations, yet the second highest August sales on
record.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a total of 479,407 cars were sold, compared with
468,945 in August 1995, according to figures released by the
Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).
</P>
<P>
The increase was, in percentage terms, one of the lowest in
recent months and followed a 5.5 percent rise in sales in the
first seven months of 1996.
</P>
<P>
August, with its new registration prefix, is traditionally the
strongest selling period, when sales account for about a quarter
of annual sales and private motorists heavily outnumber company
car buyers.
</P>
<P>
But retail sales last month were sluggish, with sales to
private customers totaling 270,978, 57 percent of the market in a
month when the industry would expect that share to be more than 60
percent.
</P>
<P>
Ernie Thompson, the SMMT's chief executive, said, "The retail
market, which has been growing recently at 10 percent, slowed to
less than 1 percent, despite a massive marketing campaign by the
industry."
</P>
<P>
Imports accounted for 62.8 percent of sales, up from 60 percent
last year. Market leader Ford's market share slipped heavily to
18.7 percent on sales drop of almost 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
The biggest winners last month were Peugeot-Citroen, Renault
and Volkswagen, while South Korean brands continued to perform
strongly among smaller carmakers.

JOHANNESBURG, September 6 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's final
constitution, adopted by the Constitutional Assembly (CA) on May
8, is "a monumental achievement" though the document has not been
certified by the Constitutional Court, the court said today.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the court ruling, ten of the 11 Constitutional
Court judges concurred in their judgement that though the
constitution complied with the "overwhelming majority" of the
constitutional principles, it did not comply with all of them and
therefore could not be certified.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the constitution has been referred back to the CA,
which took almost two years to draft the document, and the CA now
has three months to set it right.
</P>
<P>
The Constitutional Court's judgement caused mixed reactions
among major political parties, business sector and organized
labor.
</P>
<P>
The African National Congress and its allies welcomed the
court's ruling, saying the court confirmed the validity of the
general structure and content of the document.
</P>
<P>
The National Party also welcomed the court's ruling, saying it
confirmed the "correctness of the process followed" by the CA.
</P>
<P>
While the Democratic Party and Conservative Party said the
Constitutional Court's rejection of the proposed constitution was
evidence that the constitution could not have stood the test of
time.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The Namibian and Angolan
governments have reviewed progress in implementation of their
cooperation accords in a bid to enhance bilateral ties, the
Southern African Broadcasting Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
The review on the implementation of the agreements, signed by
the two neighboring countries soon after Namibia's independence
in 1990, was carried out during talks of the Namibia-Angola Joint
Commission of Cooperation in the Angolan capital Luanda, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
These agreements were focused on the cooperation in the fields
of agriculture, fisheries, higher education, trade and water.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, joint ventures, such as management of fish stocks
in the southeastern Atlantic Ocean and delimitation of maritime
borders, also topped the discussions at the meeting in Luanda.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are currently looking into possibilities to
set up a livestock control commission to curb smuggling of cattle
across the common borders.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Olympic silver medalist China
fought off strong challenge from South Korea to win 3-2 in a close
match in the second leg of the world women's volleyball Grand Prix
preliminaries here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
After the marathon match, the Chinese finally outspiked their
opponents 14-16, 15-7, 13-15, 15-9, 15-9 for their second
consecutive victory in the Beijing leg.
</P>
<P>
China surged to a 14-12 lead in the first set but only to see
the Koreans, helped by their vigorous defense, staged a dramatic
comeback.
</P>
<P>
Similar scenes happened in the third set, in which South Korea
rallied from 11-13 behind to snatch the set.
</P>
<P>
Ace spiker Sun Yue scored five points and substitute Wang
Ziling had three to power China past their arch rival in the
fast-firing deciding set.
</P>
<P>
Chinese coach Lang Ping said it was the third time this year
that her team had to battle five sets before overcoming South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
"We had chances to take the first and third sets but failed to
wrangle the critical winning points from the opponents. The South
Korean defence is very good and they have the fastest
counterattacks in the world. We have to find ways to improve our
blocking and defence."
</P>
<P>
South Korean coach Kim Cheol-yong said his squad had their top
performance although they lost the match.
</P>
<P>
"We have not the kind of bench depth like China," he said. "It
is a pity that we don't possess such talented spiker like Sun Yue."
</P>
<P>
In another match on Saturday, Olympic champion Cuba, who routed
South Korea 3-0 on Friday, also continued its winning streak by
thrashing the Netherlands 15-5, 15-7, 15-4.
</P>
<P>
"Today we were stronger in service, receiving and attacking. We
gave the Netherlands no chance to fight back," said Cuba's coach
Antonio Perdomo.
</P>
<P>
Dutch coach Bert Goedkoop said: "We try to play the game better
(than yesterday) but made too many mistakes, especially in
service."
</P>
<P>
Regla Torres scored 11 points to lead the Cubans, followed by
Regla Bell and Marleny Costa both at seven. The Dutch top scorer
Jerine Fleurke had only three.
</P>
<P>
China will face Cuba while South Korea meets the Netherlands on
Sunday, the final day of the Beijing leg, before the teams moving
to Macao or Honolulu for the third leg competition.

<HEADLINE> China Wants Expanded Ties with South Pacific Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- China is ready to expand
relations with the South Pacific Forum and its members into
broader fields and bring them onto a higher level, a senior
Chinese official said today.
</P>
<P>
Li Zhaoxing, China's vice foreign minister, told a Post-Forum
Dialogue meeting with the South Pacific Forum members in Majuro,
Marshall Islands that the Chinese government has always attached
importance to the development of relations with the South Pacific
Forum.
</P>
<P>
He said that the dialogue mechanism of the Forum has provided
China with a "very good opportunity for friendly exchange of views
and expansion of consensus on issues of common interest,
enhancement of understanding and mutual trust, and promotion of
multilateral and bilateral cooperation to the benefit of both
sides."
</P>
<P>
Li is in the Republic of Marshall Islands at the head of a
six-member delegation for dialogue meetings between the Forum
members and its dialogue partners following the annual Forum
summit held on September 3-5.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation held talks with representatives of the
Forum, including its secretary-general Ieremia Tabai, this
afternoon, according to Chinese sources close to the meeting. The
talks lasted about two hours.
</P>
<P>
China is one of the dialogue partners of the Forum. The other
dialogue partners are Canada, France, the European Union, Japan,
South Korea, Britain and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China has always supported the Forum's unremitting
efforts in enhancing regional cooperation, promoting peace and
stability in the South Pacific, developing regional economy,
rationally exploring resources and protecting the natural
environment.
</P>
<P>
"We admire and appreciate the gratifying achievements scored by
the Forum in various fields over the past 25 years and wish the
Forum even greater success in the years to come," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that there was no conflict of fundamental interests or
mutual threat between China and the Forum members.
</P>
<P>
"Instead, we have common interests in and important
responsibility for the maintenance of peace and stability in the
Asia-Pacific," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have common interests and share similar positions on the
establishment of a new international order and the maintenance of
the legitimate rights and interests of the developing countries."
</P>
<P>
He said that China always supports the just position and
reasonable demand of the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to continue coordinating our position and
improving the cooperation with the Forum and its members in our
concerted efforts to establish a fair and reasonable new
international economic order," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the cooperation between China and the Forum and
its members has developed steadily in recent years.
</P>
<P>
China has sent government representatives to the last six
Post-Forum Dialogues. In July this year, Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen visited Papua New Guinea, Fiji and
Western Samoa and met with Forum Secretary-General Tabai.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, two-way trade between China and the Forum members
totalled 4.922 billion US dollars, 134 million US dollars of which
was between China and the smaller South Pacific island countries.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, China's trade with the South
Pacific island countries was valued at around 50.77 million US
dollars, of which 18.715 million US dollars was for exports and
32.055 million US dollars for imports.
</P>
<P>
Between 1986 and 1995, the Chinese government carried out over
51 multilateral assistance projects gratis with the South Pacific
Forum, the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission and 15
Forum members.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Chinese government has encouraged Chinese
firms to invest, set up joint ventures and undertake projects and
labor contracts in the Island States.
</P>
<P>
In a new development, the Chinese Government has agreed to host
a trade office of the Forum in China and to provide it with
facility and certain funding assistance.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the Chinese government has also taken note of the
attitudes of the Forum members on the question of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"To our pleasure and appreciation, the Forum and the majority
of its members understand and support the "one-China" policy of
the Chinese Government and respect our principled position on the
question of Taiwan," he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China firmly opposes the establishment of
official relations or official contact or exchange between the
Taiwan authorities and countries that have diplomatic relations
with China.
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced that the Forum and its members that are
friendly toward China will continue adhering to the "one-China"
policy and refrain from entering into any official relations with
Taiwan," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that China was fully confident of the future of the
relations between China and the countries of the South Pacific.
</P>
<P>
"China will facilitate the development of friendly cooperation
and mutually-beneficial relations between China and the Forum
members at a higher level and in broader fields," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the talks, the hosts briefed the Chinese delegation about
the outcome of the Forum's summit, and said Forum member countries
will continue their economic reforms. They also welcomed Chinese
business people to invest in the forum member countries.
</P>
<P>
Li and his delegation will leave Majuro for home tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, U.S. to Set up Business Development Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and the United
States will set up a joint Business Development Forum to boost
commercial links between the two countries, a visiting senior U.S.
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference before leaving for home, U.S.
Assistant Secretary of Commerce Raymond E. Vickery said the Forum
will emphasize strong public-private partnership between the U.S.
and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, a draft Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
regarding the Forum was signed by Vickery and Pakistani Secretary
of Board of Investment Syed Mohibullah Shah.
</P>
<P>
"We discussed the proposed forum in which the U.S. and
Pakistani businessmen would work together towards the goals of
promoting commercial activity and resolving issues in the
commercial relationship," Vickery said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed satisfaction over the progress on the MOU and
noted that "a large number of MOUs signed between Pakistan and the
United States have materialized."
</P>
<P>
He added that, however, MOUs for large infrastructure projects
do not take shape overnight.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question on the security of the U.S. business
interests in Pakistan, Vickery said that "the situation seems to
be improving in many areas of Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
"We have over a dozen energy projects which are going forward
and we have companies which are here for the last 20 to 30 years,
in pharmaceutical industry, telecommunication and we have
businesses across the board," he added.
</P>
<P>
Vickery arrived here Thursday for a three-day visit to
Pakistan. During his stay, he held discussions with senior
Pakistani officials and expressed satisfaction over the progress
in both the political and economic fields in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Vickery said that in his discussions with Pakistani officials
he stressed the importance of a strong public-private partnership,
the role of small and medium-sized enterprises in commercial
relationships between Pakistan and the U.S. and the role of
environmental technologies in promoting the quality of life.
</P>
<P>
"We will be proceeding with implementation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Vickery said he also met with representatives of the U.S.
companies here to obtain their views on steps to strengthen
commercial ties with Pakistan.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Professor Wang Jinyu and his
colleagues continued their discussions about archives long after
the 13th International Congress on Archives closed its final
session today.
</P>
<P>
"I had long aspired for the opening of the congress for eight
years," the professor said. "Last night when experts attending the
congress gathered to sing and dance together, I was enjoying
myself in exchanging views on the protection of archives with
Japanese and American friends."
</P>
<P>
Wang, from Zhengzhou University in central China's Henan
Province, specializes in the study of the history of the world's
archives, and has many contacts with colleagues in the same field
overseas. But he treasures any opportunity to talk shop with other
archives professionals from throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
China is becoming a hot spot for hosting international
conferences, from last year's Fourth World Conference on Women of
the United Nations, to this year's International Geological
Congress, the International Anti-corruption Conference, the
General Conference of the International Federation of Library
Association, and the Inter-parliamentary Union.
</P>
<P>
"Beijing will develop into a center of international
conferences soon," said Jia Jike, general manager of the Beijing
International Conference Center.
</P>
<P>
"It is a symbol of China's in-depth carring out of its national
reform and opening policies, and it also displays the strong
desire of the Chinese people for understanding the world as a
whole," he added.

Many foreign representatives and reporters who participated in
the conferences were impressed by the hospitality of the Chinese
people.
</P>
<P>
"They are always ready to lend you a helping hand," said one
reporter.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government values such gatherings, and asks top
leaders to address and speak at the sessions.
</P>
<P>
Many foreign experts and officials agreed that China is more
beautiful and modernized than they have expected, and that the
Chinese people are warmhearted and friendly.
</P>
<P>
"Through a dozen years of national reform and opening-up,
China's economy has been strengthened, and the Chinese are more
skillful in their foreign contacts," said Jean-Pierre Wallot,
chairman of the International Council on Archives.
</P>
<P>
"Their success in sponsoring different international
conferences is a proven evidence," he added.
</P>
<P>
Trevor J. D. Powell, a Canadian expert in archives, said that
although China is a developing country, it has taken the lead in
archives protection in many aspects, and that the Chinese
professionals are well-educated and have high standards.
</P>
<P>
Peter Fanitis, an Australian expert in archives who is working
in Cambodia, said he enjoys contacts with his Chinese counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Wang Jinyu has pledged to widen his academic ties
worldwide by writing more papers and attending more international
conferences in the years ahead.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Position on Economic Summit Unchanged: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said today that Egypt's position on a regional economic
conference has remained unchanged despite a landmark meeting
between Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
"The issue is not meetings and hand shakes, but rather depends
on Israel's implementation of agreements that could constitute
progress," Moussa said. "Egypt's position on the conference will
remain the same until we see real progress."
</P>
<P>
Egypt has threatened to cancel the Middle East and North Africa
Economic Summit, slated to be held in Cairo in November, if there
is no progress in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Arafat met Netanyahu for the first time for a
brief summit on the Israeli-Gaza border to reactivate the stalled
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Moussa, asked whether the opening of Palestinian-Israeli talks
on Hebron could activate the peace march, said that there has been
an agreement on Hebron.
</P>
<P>
"If negotiations on this matter are reopened, they would not
constitute a step forward," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Israel has wanted to change the terms of its promised pullout
from the West Bank town of Hebron on grounds that it wants to
protect Jewish settlers there.
</P>
<P>
"It remains up to the Palestinian Authority to decide on this
issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel should withdraw from Hebron and resume the
Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks, he said.

It was the first meeting between the two leaders since
Netanyahu took office in June. Trying to keep a campaign promise,
he has long shunned Arafat, whom he accused of "harboring
terrorism."
</P>
<P>
The meeting helped ease Israeli-Palestinian tension which has
been growing since Netanyahu's May election victory over former
Prime Minister Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, the two leaders agreed to a series of
lower-level talks during which key outstanding issues would be
discussed.
</P>
<P>
Among the issues on the agenda is Israel's desire to change
the terms of its promised pullout from the West Bank town of
Hebron to protect Jewish settlers there, and the Palestinians'
demand that Israel ease the six-month closure of their
territories.
</P>
<P>
Describing the meeting as "positive", Arafat praised Netanyahu
for agreeing to hold the meeting that would increase mutual
cooperation to push forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In Rome, Arafat said Thursday that the issue of Jerusalem
would either make or break the Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
Israel has insisted on an undivided Jerusalem as its
capital. While the Palestinians have demanded the establishment
of an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Arafat often comes to Egypt to confer with Mubarak on the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the first Arab country to make peace with Israel,
and Mubarak has been active in mediating between the
Palestinians and Israelis.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Angola Peace Process Faces New Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The peace process in Angola is
facing another test arising from the latest dispute over the
future position for the former rebel UNITA leader, Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
The ruling MPLA party decided on Wednesday to withdraw the
offer of deputy presidency in a government of national unity for
Savimbi, a key conciliatory condition stipulated in the Lusaka
peace accord of 1994.
</P>
<P>
The MPLA decision came after UNITA's recent rejection to that
offer of "special status", which was interpreted as the second
deputy presidency at the MPLA central committee meeting held in
February this year.
</P>
<P>
Savimbi has on several occasions expressed dissatisfaction at
the second deputy presidency offer, indicating he is willing to
take the position of deputy presidency, instead of a second
deputy, which he terms as a surplus.
</P>
<P>
Something evil is now hanging over the Angolan people like the
sword of Damocles. The on-going dispute awakens reminiscences of
the renewed hostilities in 1992, when the two sides took up arms
again in disagreement over the results of the country's first
general election, which was meant to end years of civil war since
independence from Portugal in 1975.
</P>
<P>
It was with the mediation of the United Nations that the
warring sides eventually signed their most significant peace
accord in the Zambian capital of Lusaka on November 20, 1994.
</P>
<P>
Reports say the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) has ever since quartered most of its 63,000 troops
for demobilization or integration into a new unified national
army.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the near success of peace in the war-torn southern
African country, UN special envoy to Angola Blondin Beye has
recently visited the UNITA stronghold city of Bilundo for good
offices twice.
</P>
<P>
Other political voices in Angola are strongly urging the two
sides to resolve the dispute through negotiations to save the
delicate peace process.

<HEADLINE> France Begins Debate on Proportionate Voting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- France has begun debate on
whether to change its legislative and regional election model
after Prime Minister Alain Juppe said on Thursday that he was
considering introducing a proportional representation system.
</P>
<P>
However, the debate could be a long and tedious because no one
questioned the representativeness of the National Assembly which
was elected in 1993 in the traditional way. That was by a majority
of votes by constituencies based on departments, said Le Figaro
daily today.
</P>
<P>
The request for a proportional system in legislative elections
was made by some minority parties including the Green Party and
the National Front, which are excluded from parliament for failing
to obtain the minimum 23 representatives required to enter.
</P>
<P>
But the idea of proportionality was also patronized by
President Jacques Chirac during his presidential campaign last
year, and supported in principle by Socialist Party chief Lionel
Jospin.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by Le Monde daily, two options have been
proposed by the government to change the election model. The first
suggests an increase of several dozen extra seats in the 577-seat
parliament to let small parties enter parliament on the basis of a
proportional list.
</P>
<P>
The second suggests the maintenance of the current "majority
votes" election method in less-populated departments, while a
proportional system would be introduced to the polling mechanism
of the more-populated departments, such as the Paris area,
Nord-pas-de-Calais, Rhone-Alpes and Provence-Cote d'Azur.

<HEADLINE> Denial of Japanese Aggression During WWII "Very Stupid" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Japanese scholars said it is
"very stupid" to deny or cover up the fact that Japan ever invaded
China and committed war crimes here during World War II.
</P>
<P>
Masahito Ando, a Japanese scholar who is attending the 13th
International Congress on Archives which opened here Monday and
closed here today, addressed the behavior and statements made by
some Japanese politicians who have continued to deny there have
been any Japanese aggression on Chinese soil. A few of the
politicians have even claimed the Nanjing Massacre was an incident
fabricated by the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
"Most of us think they are very stupid," Ando said.
</P>
<P>
Just over a month ago, Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto visited the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, where memorial
services are held for Japan's war dead, including seven class-A
criminals executed at the end of the World War II.
</P>
<P>
The visit aroused indignation from Japan's Asian neighbors,
China and Korea in particular, who suffered bitterly from the
Japanese militarist aggression.
</P>
<P>
Ando, an associate professor with the Department of Historical
Manuscripts of the National Institute of Japanese Literature, has
studied archive history for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
He said that a lot of documents and pictures about the war were
destroyed on the orders of the Japanese government and its army
before Japan surrendered at the end of WWII.
</P>
<P>
"They were afraid that the documents and pictures could be
evidence of the trial of war crimes," Ando said, adding that it was
an urgent task of archivists to "re-find the image of the past."
</P>
<P>
Some remnants of evidence were brought to the United States by
US soldiers who later occupied Japan.
</P>
<P>
Mikiko Matsumura, deputy director of the Statutes and
Parliamentary Documents Division of the Japanese National Diet
Library, said that there were no historical collections to
illustrate the Japanese aggression during WWII in her library. She
said she had to go to the United States in order to research the
subject.
</P>
<P>
The United States returned some of the war archives in 1951 and
in 1970. The archives included diaries of Japanese soldiers and
reports of troops to the Japanese army and navy headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Ando had opportunities to study these archives. But he said
that the archives of war kept by Japan were still very limited,
and that most of them were kept by the Defense Agency and the National
Archives. Ordinary Japanese people seldom had any chances to view
them, he said.
</P>
<P>
As China has a greater collection of WWII archives, Ando hopes
that Chinese and Japanese archivists will cooperate in using these
archives. He suggested some of the archives be translated into
Japanese, so that more Japanese scholars and people can learn the
truth of the past.
</P>
<P>
Ando said that Zhao Yunpeng, deputy director of the Liaoning
Provincial Archives, plans to visit Liaoning next year.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-five years ago, Japanese troops attacked Chinese army in
northeast China's Liaoning Province. The event marked the
beginning of Japanese aggression against China and other
Asian-Pacific countries.
</P>
<P>
Among many archive collections of the Liaoning Provincial
Archives, more than 60,000 volumes were about a Japanese railway
company, which was stationed in Shenyang to implement the Japanese
government's "state policy" to invade China.
</P>
<P>
From these documents, Chinese archivists discovered reports
made by Japanese security guards about the aftermath of the
Nanjing Massacre. These reports became proven evidence of the
crimes committed by Japanese troops in that action.
</P>
<P>
Some 300,000 local residents of Nanjing, east China, were
massacred by invading Japanese soldiers in the first six weeks
after the city fell into the enemy's hands at the end of 1937.

<P>
MOSCOW, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl today held a three-and-half-hour
discussion on bilateral and international issues including the
proposed NATO enlargement.
</P>
<P>
The talks took place at a picturesque hunting lodge about 100
kilometers northwest of Moscow, where Yeltsin is on vacation.
</P>
<P>
It was Yeltsin's first encounter with a Western head of
government since he was elected on July 3 to a second four-year
term in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Kohl told Yeltsin that no decision on the NATO enlargement
would be taken this year, Itar-Tass news agency said, quoting an
unnamed source.
</P>
<P>
The source said the question of extending the Western military
alliance to East European countries, which Moscow strongly
opposes, had been a major topic of the discussion.
</P>
<P>
"The parties agreed that a decision on enlarging NATO to the
east would be taken subject to the development of relations
between Russia and the North Atlantic alliance," Tass quoted the
source as saying.
</P>
<P>
Kohl's one-day visit was decided in a phone talk the two
leaders had on July 4.

CAIRO, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are business
briefs from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordan has no intention to raise price of fuel oil or
seek alternate sources of crude and fuel oil to replace its
current oil supplier Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Any report or suggestion that the government plans to increase
the fuel price is completely groundless," Today's Jordan Times
quoted Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Hashem Dabbas as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Amman is "buying" all the oil it needs from Iraq, 50,000 barrel
of crude and 25,000 barrel of fuel oil per day. In return, it
supplies Iraq with food and medicine in an arrangement that suits
Jordan's requirement.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is anxious about the prospects of oil finds in the Dead
Sea after Israel has discovered oil in the Israeli side of the
Dead Sea.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN --Iran and South Africa are expected to expand ties in
the field of oil and will undertake some joint ventures in this
connection.
</P>
<P>
English-language daily Tehran Times reported today that oil
experts of the two countries are working on an important project
on natural gas, for which Iran and South Africa will sign a
memorandum of understanding.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Oil Minister Golamreza Aqazadeh announced that Iran
supplies some 70 percent of South Africa's oil requirements.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The South Korean Agency for International Development
decided to allocate 1.5 million U.S. dollars in the form of a
non-refundable grant for Egypt to conduct marketing, management
studies and to lay out the general blueprints of the Technology
Valley, which is now under construction east of the Suez Canal.
</P>
<P>
The valley, when completed, will comprise high technology
industries set up by the different technologically-advanced
countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- For the first time, a private-run steam power
generating station will be erected in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Ministry of Electricity and Energy has received
about 54 offers from international financing companies and
institutions for setting up the first steam power station.
</P>
<P>
The station's ownership will be devolved to the sector of
Electricity without its incurring of any financial burdens after
period to be agreed upon.

<HEADLINE> Kissinger Says U.S., China Should Develop Constructive Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- China and the U.S. have common
interests which should be further developed, former U.S. Secretary
of State Dr. Henry Kissinger said today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
In the past few days Dr. Kissinger has been an active
participant in the "21st Century Forum," which closed on
Friday. The forum was sponsored by the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee.
</P>
<P>
In an interview before his departure from the Chinese capital,
Dr. Kissinger said that great progress has been made in the
U.S.-China relations in the past 25 years, when the ice between
the two countries first started to melt.
</P>
<P>
"If we could cooperate then, it should be a lot easier to
cooperate from now on," he said at the conclusion of the forum,
which was attended by 50 international statesmen and scholars, who
discussed the role of Asia, particularly China, in the next
century.
</P>
<P>
In July 1971, Dr. Kissinger, who was then security advisor to
President Richard Nixon, secretly visited China to pave the way
for the rapprochement between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"I can hardly believe it's been a quarter century," Kissinger
said. "Having come this far, it should be easier to go from here
into the future. We should look at China as a friend, and a
potential partner, not an adversary."
</P>
<P>
"The problems we have had are avoidable," he said, emphasizing
that the two sides can voice different opinions and discuss them,
but should not "employ sanctions."
</P>
<P>
The former secretary of state said he regards U.S.-China
relations as a pillar of peace and security in the world in the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
This is not only because he likes the Chinese people, he said,
but also it is in the best interests of the U.S. and China.
</P>
<P>
"My impression is that considerable progress has been made in
U.S.-China relations since Security Advisor Anthony Lake visited
China two months ago," said Dr. Kissinger, who has now visited
China 28 times.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the U.S. and China should develop
"constructive relations."
</P>
<P>
"I am very optimistic about U.S.-China relations," he added.

<HEADLINE> India's Former PM Seeks Recalling of Summons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Former Indian prime minister
P.V. Narasimha Rao on Friday filed an application in a local court
here pleading for recalling of summons issued against him in a
100,000-U.S. dollar cheating case, The Hindustan Times said today.
</P>
<P>
Rao, who is also president of the Congress party, has been
charged with helping a controversial godman in cheating
non-resident Indian businessman Lakhubhai Pathak of 100,000 U.S.
dollars in 1983 by falsely promising newsprint and paper pulp
contracts to him.
</P>
<P>
Rao's case was first taken up by the Delhi High Court when
magistrate Prem Kumar issued summons to the former prime minister
on July 9 based on testimony of Lakhubhai Pathak.
</P>
<P>
Having failed in challenging the summons, the former prime
minister, through his counsel, later submitted a plea at India's
Supreme Court, asking it to either quash the summons or transfer
the case to another judge for a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
At a hearing held on Rao's plea on August 22, the apex court
also maintained the summons issued by magistrate Kumar against Rao
but agreed to transfer the case to another judge of the Delhi
court, Ajit Bharihoke.
</P>
<P>
In the application filed on Friday in the court of the new
judge, the former prime minister said the testimony of Lakhubhai
Pathak was intrinsically untrustworthy when appreciated in its
entirety.
</P>
<P>
Rao in his plea questioned the legitimacy of the summons and
hoped that judge Bharihoke would recall the summons against him.
</P>
<P>
The new judge will hold a hearing on Rao's application
tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Ready to Solve Disputes through Peaceful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Iraq expressed readiness to
solve its current dispute through peaceful means, today's local
newspaper Iraq reported.
</P>
<P>
"It is not difficult for the Iraqis to work out an all-round
solution to dispute with the Kurdish, but it is difficult for
them to solve the Iraqi-Kuwaiti dispute engineered by occupiers,"
the paper quoted Iraqi Undersecretary of the Ministry of
Information Nory Nejm Al-Marsoumy as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said it was easy to solve the Iraqi-Turkish
border problems.
</P>
<P>
Peace in the region requires the withdrawal of all foreign
troops and an immediate end to violations of the Iraqi airspace
by U.S. fighters, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The United States must reconsider its policies in a more
reasonable way and stop its repeated aggressions on Iraq, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The only possible peace in the region is the peace that can
put an end to the military confrontations and guarantee the right
of the peoples of the region to solve their own problems", he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Al-Marsoumy called on the allied powers to reconsider their
positions and the U.S. policies which would have "devastating
consequences on the present and the future of these powers."
</P>
<P>
If these powers manage to stop the intervention by the U.S. or
any other foreign party in the Iraqi internal affairs, peace in the
region will be achieved, the Iraqi official said.

<HEADLINE> Macedonian President Calls for Withdrawal of U.N. Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Macedonian President Kiro
Gligorov has called for the withdrawal of the United Nations
Preventive Deployment Force (UNPDF) from his country.
</P>
<P>
The request follows closely on another request last month in
which the Macedonian government asked the U.N. Security Council
to renew the UPPDF mandate.
</P>
<P>
Gligorov told the weekly Skoplje Pulse, published today, that
relations between Macedonia and Yugoslavia were satisfactory as
Yugoslavia had recognized the borders between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The border demarcation was only a technical matter and the two
countries had established a joint committee to look into it, the
Macedonian president said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Macedonia was facing no security threat so it
could withdraw the request for the deployment of U.N. forces on
its soil.
</P>
<P>
The 1,100-strong UNPDF, contributed to by the United States and
Nordic countries, was deployed in Macedonia in 1993 to
protect it after the former republic of Yugoslavia announced
independence.
</P>
<P>
Its mandate was earlier extended to November 30, 1996 at the
request of the Macedonian government.

<HEADLINE> Archives Show China's Modern Postal Service Originated from Tianjin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- China's first set of stamps,
published in Shanghai and issued in Tianjin in July 1878, were
displayed here in the 13th International Congress on Archives that
ended here today, justifying Tianjin as the birthplace of China's
modern postal service.
</P>
<P>
Archives show that in 1878, Li Hongzhang, an imperial minister
in charge of the coastal provinces of Hebei, Liaoning and
Shandong, designated Gustay Detring, a British German in charge of
the taxation office in the customs of Tianjin, to create China's
modern postal service modeled after Europe's postal system.
</P>
<P>
In the same year, Detring established China's postal service in
Beijing, Shanghai, Yantai, Niuzhuang (now called Yingkou) and
Tianjin, which was the center, and ordered the publishing of
100,000 sets of Dalong Stamps.
</P>
<P>
An archival expert from Tianjin said that the beginning of the
Beijing-Tianjin Postal Route -- which featured postmen on
horseback delivering mail between Beijing and Tianjin -- on March
23, 1878, demonstrated that China's modern postal service had
started to take shape.
</P>
<P>
In 1918, China opened what was then the longest postal route on
land, starting from Tianjin, via Hebei and Gansu Provinces, to
Urumqi (then called Dihua), capital city of northwest China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
According to historical records, back in the Zhou and Qin
dynasties some 2,000 to 3,000 years ago, China had its own postal
system, which was mainly used for military purposes.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Holds Talks with Mubarak on Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
held talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on
Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations at the Cairo airport here
today.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who arrived here earlier today on a short visit to
Egypt, would brief Mubarak on his landmark meeting with Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Natanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Moussa and Mubarak's top aide Osama el-Baz also attended the
meeting between Mubarak and Arafat.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Arafat met Netanyahu for a brief summit on the
Israeli-Gaza border in a bid to reactivate the stalled peace
process.
</P>
<P>
It was the first face-to-face meeting between the two leaders
since Netanyahu took office in June. Trying to keep a campaign
promise, he has long shunned Arafat, whom he accused of
"harboring terrorism."
</P>
<P>
The meeting is believed to have helped ease Israeli-Palestinian
tension which has been growing since Netanyahu's May election
victory over former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
In the summit, the two leaders agreed to a series of
lower-level talks during which key outstanding issues would be
discussed.
</P>
<P>
Among the issues on the agenda is Israel's desire to change
the terms of its promised pullout from the West Bank town of
Hebron to protect Jewish settlers there, and the Palestinians'
demand that Israel ease the six-month closure of their
territories.
</P>
<P>
Describing the meeting as "positive", Arafat praised Netanyahu
for agreeing to hold the meeting that would increase mutual
cooperation to push forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In Rome Thursday, Arafat said that the issue of Jerusalem
would either make or break the Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
Israel has insisted on an undivided Jerusalem as its
capital. While the Palestinians have demanded the establishment
of an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Arafat often comes to Egypt to confer with Mubarak on the
peace process. Egypt is the first Arab country to make peace with
Israel, and Mubarak has been active in mediating between the
Palestinians and Israelis.

BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- A seminar was held here this
afternoon to mark the publication of "Moments of A Great Man," a

Zedong.
</P>
<P>
The collection includes pictures of the late Chairman of the
Communist Party of China taken on historical occasions, as well as
his activities in managing state affairs and his daily life.
</P>

the masses. Many photos have been seen only rarely.
</P>
<P>
The photos are accompanied by captions.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The six-day 13th International
Congress on Archives ended here today, following various academic
exchanges and the election of a new ICA president.
</P>
<P>
Wang Gang, director of China's State Archives Bureau and
director of the Central Archives, was elected president. This
is the first time an archives official in a developing country has
been in the position.
</P>
<P>
Wang's presidency is expected to help China and other
developing countries play a greater role in international archive
affairs.
</P>
<P>
The ICA should strive to promote exchanges and cooperation
between the developed and developing countries, Wang said at the
closing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"In particular, it is imperative to take measures to extend the
life-span of archives as long as possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the developing countries still have difficulties
in constructing storerooms and other modern facilities, training
professional personnel and managing archives. Natural disasters,
wars and harsh environmental conditions are also endangering the
security of archives.
</P>
<P>
The ICA will make continuing efforts to facilitate more modern
management of archives in all countries, and raise the quality of
archive workers.
</P>
<P>
Wang praised the ICA's former leading officials for their
outstanding work during the past four years and thanked them for
their support.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Pierre Wallot, former president of ICA, commended China's
organization efforts as hosts of the 13th congress.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Airlines Restructured to face </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Linhas Airlines
(LAM) will resume its domestic flight from Maputo to Lichinga,
capital of the northern Niassa province in October after
disruption in April.
</P>
<P>
This would be realized after LAM hires a plane with 96 seats
from Swaziland through negotiations, LAM General Manager Jose
Viegas announced here this week.
</P>
<P>
Viegas also disclosed that a new airplane will fly to
Johannesburg from Beira, the second biggest city in the country
twice per week as from next month.
</P>
<P>
The old Boeing-737 will continue in service, but the oldest
one would be rehabilitated in order to change the outlook of LAM
thoroughly, and all this forms part of the restructuring reform
of the airlines, according to the manager.
</P>
<P>
The Fokker-100 plane made in 1992 would be in normal
maintenance in Maputo to save costs, Viegas added.
</P>
<P>
He said LAM made a profit of 7,800 million Meticais (650,000
US Dollars) in the first half of this year compared to a loss
of five million US Dollars in the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time LAM makes profits since 1992, he said,
noting that although the most difficult time is over, LAM still
faces a lot of challenges, a debt of two million U.S. Dollars to
pay, for example.
</P>
<P>
Besides, competition remains sharp in the southern African
region, especially with the South African Airlines, he said.

JAKARTA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- An earthquake measuring 5.1 on
the Richter Scale shook Manado, capital of North Sulawesi province
Friday afternoon, reports reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
The tremor, which was also felt in nearby towns in the province
for nearly one minute, forced thousands of local people to stay
outdoors.
</P>

Manado and some 100 kilometers beneath the sea bed.
</P>
<P>
There were no immediate reports of casualties and damage.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia lies within the so-called Pacific Rim "Ring of Fire,"
an area marked by volcanoes and earthquakes.

<HEADLINE> Asia Pacific Region "Better and More Complicated": Kissinger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger said here today that the situation in the
Asia-Pacific region has become "better and more complicated" since
the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Chinese reporters here this morning,
Kissinger said that the region has undergone rapid development and
become better off economically.
</P>
<P>
All these factors led to the emergence of powers - China,
Japan, India, Southeast Asia, the ASEAN and Russia - and their
greater influence on the surrounding areas in the region, he
explained.
</P>
<P>
He added that the interactions among the newly emerged powers
are more complicated.
</P>
<P>
The former secretary of state said the U.S. can play a
constructive role in close cooperation with countries concerned,
but should not get involved in the internal affairs of those
countries. He cited the Taiwan issue as an example.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the security treaties we have cannot and should not
be used in containment policy...and should not be directed against
any country," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Kissinger said it is a different world now compared with early
this century and no country can benefit from confrontations.
</P>
<P>
All countries, especially those with the most power, bear
particular responsibility for regional security, he said, adding
that statesmen of all countries must have "vision" on the major
issues which have bearing on the future.
</P>
<P>
Kissinger, who is here to attend the first conference of the
21st Century Forum, said the forum has made a "significant
contribution" to the increased understanding between different
countries.
</P>
<P>
Kissinger is scheduled to leave here later today.

Holyfield and Tyson originally were set to fight in 1990. But
Tyson injured his ribs and before a new date could be agreed to,
he was sent to prison for three years on a rape conviction.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia's CPO, Tin, Rubber Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's markets of
crude palm oil (CPO), rubber and tin ended the week higher or
mixed.
</P>
<P>
Strong sentiment on palm oil futures led to a higher close for
the CPO cash market this week.
</P>
<P>
September-South contracts settled higher on Friday at 1,265
ringgit (about 506 U.S. dollars) per ton against last week's close
of 1,235 ringgit (about 494 U.S. dollars) per ton.
</P>
<P>
The week saw volatile trading while prices reached their
highest level of 1,275 ringgit (about 510 U.S. dollars) per ton
twice in the week.
</P>
<P>
The Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) also settled higher this
week to finish at 15.13 ringgit (about 6.05 U.S. dollars) per
kilogram against 15.08 ringgit (about 6.03 U.S. dollars) per
kilogram last week.
</P>
<P>
A dealer said that this week's market was firmer because of the
strength of other base metals traded on the London Metal Exchange
(LME).
</P>
<P>
Turnover this week improved to 721 tons against 665 tons last
week with European, Japanese and locals taking a bulk of the
week's transactions.
</P>
<P>
However, the Malaysian rubber market closed the week mixed
owing to uncertainty and the lack of fresh factors.
</P>
<P>
September RSS One dropped by one sen to 329.00 sen (about 131.6
U.S. cents) per kilogram against last Friday's close at 330.00 sen
(about 132 U.S. cents) per kilogram while SMR 20 rose by 1.50 sen
to 315.50 sen (about 126.2 U.S. cents) per kilogram from 314.00
sen (about 125.6 U.S. cents) per kilogram last week.
</P>
<P>
The market see-sawed in a narrow range this week. Prices were
mainly determined by the rain factor across the country and in the
neighboring rubber producing countries such as Thailand and
Indonesia, which caused a shortage of supply.
</P>
<P>
Buying interest from overseas maintained some firmness in the
market this week.
</P>
<P>
Japan's rubber stock levels remained high and this saw
liquidation in Tokyo rubber futures. The sell-off also affected
the Singapore and Malaysian rubber markets.

<HEADLINE> New Iraqi Military Attacks on Erbil reported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi troops launched fresh
attacks on Erbil and advanced further towards the city on Friday,
an official report said here today.
</P>
<P>
Jabar Farman, military deputy of Iraq's Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan (PUK), said that the PUK forces were forced to withdraw
from their positions following the joint assault by the Iraqi
army and the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP).
</P>
<P>
The "slight retreat" of the PUK was only a tactical move to
reinforce defense positions, Farman was quoted by the official
news agency IRNA as saying.
</P>
<P>
The latest Iraqi-KDP offensive was launched along Bistane,
Pol-e Gine, Zargate and Kordawa axes on Friday, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that U.S. military interference would sustain
irreparable losses from the perspective of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
PUK forces were compelled to pull out of Erbil due to arms and
ammunition shortages, he added.
</P>
<P>
Despite Baghdad's claims that it has pulled out of Erbil, the
Iraqi security forces in plain clothes and in collaboration with
the KDP continue house-to-house search and round up more
opposition elements, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Mustafa Chawrosh, PUK military official in Kirkuk, said that
Baghdad sent an army division to the region of Chamchal last night.
</P>
<P>
Chawrosh added that the Iraqi forces made up of five divisions
and 80 armored units are stationed one kilometer east and west of
Chamchal.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 700,000 population of Chamchal have fled the city
and sought shelter in Suleimaniyeh.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has stated that it sent troops to the north at the request
of KDP, accusing Tehran of backing PUK in the Kurdistan strife.
</P>
<P>
Iran has denied any military involvement in northern Iraq while
making no effort to hide its partiality to the PUK.
</P>
<P>
The new flare-up of fighting in northern Iraq could not be
independently confirmed so far.

<HEADLINE> Elephants Were Once as Big as Pigs: French Scientists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The first elephants were about
as big as a pig and weighed 10-15 kilograms, say French scientists
in the latest issue of the "Nature" magazine.
</P>
<P>
After discovering a fossilized elephant jawbone in Morocco in
1994 which dated back 53 million years, Emmanuel Gheerbrandt, Jean
Sudre and Henri Cappetta found another similar fossil elsewhere in
North Africa two years later.
</P>
<P>
They said that at first, the ancestors of elephants had neither
trunks or tusks, and were no larger than a pig.
</P>
<P>
Elephant ancestors were about 60 centimeters high and looked
like a tapir, or a dwarf hippopotamus. Their eyes were very high
in the skull, which could mean they lived in water with their eyes
above the surface to keep watch.
</P>
<P>
As time went on the mammals grew. About 35 million years ago,
their feet gradually developed into "pillars" to support their
weight, and tusks were formed to make up for the inconveniences of
their very short necks.
</P>
<P>
Their teeth degraded, except for the two which had grown into
tusks. By the end of their evolution elephants had attained their
maximum size, with an average of 4.5 meters to the top of their
backs.
</P>
<P>
The animals could not survive the age of glaciers, except for
the woolly mammoth, whose size was no greater than the present
elephants. They were painted by primitive men in caves and their
mummified bodies were found in Siberia.
</P>
<P>
This last group of ancient elephants died out about 10,000
years ago, with the exception of a group of degraded dwarf
elephants on the Siberian island of Wrangel, near the North Pole.
</P>
<P>
Only in Africa and tropical regions of Asia did other
descendants of elephants survive, while a rarely-known elephant
with hoof-like feet, in Africa and the Middle East, could also
have been descended from ancient elephants, said the scientists.

<P>
PHNOM PENH, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Khmer Rouge split faction
leader Ieng Sary has declared his recognition of the constitution,
the Royal Government and the territorial integrity of Cambodia,
the Co-Defense Minister, Tea Banh, said today.
</P>
<P>
Tea Banh told reporters, upon his arrival at the Phnom Penh
International Airport at noon, that his "family-style" talks with
Ieng Sary in Thailand on Friday "produced very good results."
</P>
<P>
The defense minister said Ieng Sary promised not to seek
autonomy or division in the future, and agreed to regroup his
faction into the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces.
</P>
<P>
First Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh told the press today
that Ieng Sary also agreed to open to the outside the area under
the control of his faction.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating a training center in Angsnul District of Kandal
Province in southwest Cambodia, Second Prime Minister Hun Sen said
this morning that Ieng Sary, apart from recognizing the royal
government, also accepted a law adopted by the National Assembly
in July, 1994, which outlawed the then "provisional government"
set up by the Khmer Rouge.
</P>
<P>
Ieng Sary announced early last month that his Khmer Rouge
faction would stop the civil war with the royal government.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Deputy Prime Minister
and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller said here today that Turkey has
deep concern over the situation in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Ciller said in a statement that the continuation of the
clashes in Iraq had caused "a status of anxiety" and it is vital
to solve this problem through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
She added: "There are problems in Iraq, and we believe that it
is greatly beneficial to settle these problems through dialogue,
not through fighting."
</P>
<P>
Turkey has decided to protect civil population in this region,
Kurds, Turcomans or Arabs alike, Ciller said.
</P>
<P>
"The information we received clearly shows that the Turcomans
are suffering troubles," she added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a statement issued by the president's office said
that Turkey held Friday evening a three-hour-long urgent meeting,
chaired by President Suleyman Demirel, on the latest developments
in Iraq and Turkey's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
The statement added that short-term and long-term measures
were decided to be taken in the light of Turkey's national
interests in the region.
</P>
<P>
Turkey will take initiatives at the national and international
levels to protect the security and economic interests of Turkey,
said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Turkish sources said that Turkey was seriously considering of
setting up a "safety zone", between 5-20 kilometers deep into the
Iraqi side of the border, to prevent the infiltrations of the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) into the Turkish territory.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Iraq protested Friday against
Turkey's plans for the "safety zone" stretching 5-20 kilometers
into the Iraqi territory, saying that this would violate its
sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
According to the Iraqi News Agency, Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf summoned Sadi Calislar, Turkey's Charge
d'Affaires in Baghdad and told him that a security belt was
unacceptable.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Kuala Lumpur Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Despite the uncertainty
over the U.S. interest rates and the on-going tension in the Gulf,
second board counters remained in the limelight of the Kuala
Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) this week as their index hit an
all-time high of 554.39 points on Friday, up 11.16 points.
</P>
<P>
An analyst said that after second board counters surpassed the
550-point psychological mark, their index may go up further in the
next few weeks as local investors will continue to focus on those
stocks. But he said that they can also fail drastically,
depending on the market's sentiment.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, the KLSE market turned cautious in
response to the U.S.-Iraq flare up. The market's barometer, the
Composite Index (CI), plunged below the 1,100-point level when
nervous investors came out of the market as foreign fund managers
and retail players liquidated positions.
</P>
<P>
The CI fell by 17 points to 1,089.20 following the U.S. air
attack on Iraq. The last time that the CI touched such a level
was on August 1 at 1,087 points.
</P>
<P>
On the KLSE, the main board volume was 622.558 million shares
worth 4.549 billion ringgit (about 1.820 billion U.S. dollars)
from 541.179 million shares worth 3.715 billion ringgit (about
1.486 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The second board turnover stood at 296.130 million shares
valued at 3.417 billion ringgit (about 1.367 billion U.S. dollars)
against 401.787 million shares valued at 4.381 billion ringgit
(about 1.7524 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Off-market deals amounted to 154.159 million shares worth 1.232
billion ringgit (about 492.8 million U.S. dollars) compared with
92.387 million shares worth 855.823 million ringgit (about 342.329
million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Fridays Practice Sessions to Continue, FIA Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Free practice sessions on Fridays
have been reinstated to the Formula One calendar for the 1997
season.
</P>
<P>
Max Mosely, president of the sport's international governing
body FIA, announced Saturday in Italy's Monza that plans to reduce
Grand Prix weekends to two days have been abandoned -- but the
schedule will still be increased to 17 races next year.
</P>
<P>
The FIA changed its mind following opposition from race
organisers.
</P>
<P>
"Discussions with organisers have revealed considerable
unhappiness," said Mosley. "They don't like losing the Friday and
it has also emerged there is a significant audience, even on the
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"It's been decided to keep the practice arrangements for 1997
exactly as they are for this year. We will look at it again in the
middle of 1997."
</P>
<P>
Race organisers opposed the move to scrap the free practice
sessions because it would have seriously affected their
revenue. Some venues attract 70,000-plus crowds for Friday
practice sessions.

<HEADLINE> Yunnan Pours Huge Funds in Improving Traffic Conditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Yunnan Province in southwest
China is to spend 1.7 billion yuan (204.81 million US dollars) in
a bid to beat traffic congestion in Kunming, the provincial
capital.
</P>
<P>
The investment, over the next two years, will fund the building
of nine overpasses at busy junctions, currently controlled by
traffic lights, upgrade 23 roads, stretching over 46 kilometers,
plus adding 200,000 square meters of greenery to the city.
</P>
<P>
Rapid economic and urban growth has sharply pushed up the
demands on highways, and the existing road conditions are
increasingly inadequate. The bottleneck problem has remained
unsolved for a long period because of a lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
Poor traffic conditions in downtown areas have become
especially unbearable after the recent completion of five
high-grade highways around Kunming. Many angry drivers describe
the conditions as "strong limbs propped up by a weak heart".
</P>
<P>
This has prompted the provincial government to step in with the
massive road improvement drive.
</P>
<P>
After the completion of the scheme, there will be a new city
ring road, a section with no traffic lights in the second ring
road, and several trunk roads.

<HEADLINE> WHO Employee Freed in S. Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 7 (Xinhua) -- A World Health Organization
(WHO) employee who was kidnapped by Somali gunmen early in the
week was set free on Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
The employee for WHO, a Mr. Jeylani has been released after a
series of negotiations between his captives and several young
intellectuals and paying a ransom of 2,000 U.S. Dollars, sources
close to the mediators said.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mohamed Khayre who spoke on behalf of the mediators, said
Jeylani preferred to pay the money from his own account without
any support from any one.
</P>
<P>
Dwelling on the reason of the abduction, sources close to WHO
employees said the gunmen wanted some medicine as a bribe from
the loyal storekeeper. But Jeylani refused to hand out any
unofficial stock of medicine and his abduction soon followed.
</P>
<P>
Early in the week, four gunmen stormed into the house of
Jeylani in South Mogadishu and took him away forcefully.
</P>
<P>
A month ago, a UNICEF employee was kidnapped for a similar
reason and he was freed after paying a ransom of 2,500 U.S.
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Observers here say the abduction of the aid agencies employees
seems to be discouraging the international efforts in extending
assistance to war ravaged Somalia.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Arrives in Egypt for Talks with Mubarak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority leader
Yasser Arafat arrived here today for talks with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak on the stalled Middle East peace process,
particularly the Palestinian-Israeli talks.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is expected to brief Mubarak on his landmark meeting
with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Natanyahu.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Arafat met Netanyahu for a brief summit on the
Israeli-Gaza border in a bid to reactivate the deadlocked peace
process.
</P>
<P>
It was the first meeting between the two leaders since
Netanyahu took office in June. Trying to keep a campaign promise,
he has long shunned Arafat, whom he accused of "harboring
terrorism."
</P>
<P>
The meeting helped ease Israeli-Palestinian tension which has
been growing since Netanyahu's May election victory over former
Prime Minister Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, the two leaders agreed to a series of
lower-level talks during which key outstanding issues would be
discussed.
</P>
<P>
Among the issues on the agenda is Israel's desire to change
the terms of its promised pullout from the West Bank town of
Hebron to protect Jewish settlers there, and the Palestinians'
demand that Israel ease the six-month closure of their
territories.
</P>
<P>
Describing the meeting as "positive", Arafat praised Netanyahu
for agreeing to hold the meeting that would increase mutual
cooperation to push forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In Rome, Arafat said Thursday that the issue of Jerusalem
would either make or break the Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
Israel has insisted on an undivided Jerusalem as its
capital. While the Palestinians have demanded the establishment
of an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Arafat often comes to Egypt to confer with Mubarak on the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the first Arab country to make peace with Israel,
and Mubarak has been active in mediating between the
Palestinians and Israelis.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Police Cited for Uncovering Bombing Plot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos today
commended the Philippine National Police for discovering a plot of
three terrorists to blow up 12 commercial airliners of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by the president's press secretary, Ramos
said that the terrorists' recent conviction in New York on all
seven charges related to their dastardly scheme is "a triumph of
good over evil."
</P>
<P>
The plot of the three Muslim radicals was discovered on January
6, 1995, when a fire broke out at an apartment in Malate city of
the Philippines, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Philippine policemen found explosives, bomb-making manuals,
timers, a laptop computer with flight information, detonation
times and a letter claiming responsibility for the planned
bombings at the apartment.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that a civilized society must not tolerate global
terrorism and that all nations must condemn it, Ramos urged the
Philippine National Police and the armed forces of the country to
meet the challenge of the times and uphold peace over violence.

PYONGYANG, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's

</P>
<P>
The official newspaper Rodong Sinmun said in an article that
the U.S. plan to change "Free Asia Radio" into "Asia Pacific
Radio" aims to disseminate the American way of life in the Asian
region and the U.S. harbors an intention to divide and
disintegrate Asian countries in an attempt to seek domination in
the region.

<P>
But some Asian countries have turned down the U.S. requests to
use their territories for broadcasting, said the article.
</P>

The Free Asia Radio, which was initiated and sponsored by the

<HEADLINE> Jordan Denies Plan for Fuel Price Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian government denied
reports that it intended to raise the price of fuel or seek
alternate sources of crude and fuel oil to replace its current
oil supplier Iraq, according to the local press here today.
</P>
<P>
"There is no intention to raise the price of any fuel," said
Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Hashem Dabbas, quoted by
the English-language daily Jordan Times.
</P>
<P>
"Any report or suggestion that the government plans to raise
fuel prices is completely groundless," he added.
</P>
<P>
The government raised fuel price in 1989 in line with an
International Monetary Fund (IMF) recommendation, which sparked
riots in the south.
</P>
<P>
Independent sources here said there was no stipulation in the
ongoing IMF program for any increase in the fuel prices except a
"re-accounting" of the actual cost of oil consumed in Jordan to
reflect the kingdom's fiscal budget.
</P>
<P>
Jordan Times said that officials here also affirmed that the
country has no intention to seek alternate sources to replace
Iraq for its oil needs.
</P>
<P>
"The present arrangement with Iraq suits Jordan's requirements,
and the government finds no reason whatsoever to change it," said
a senior official, quoted by the daily.
</P>
<P>
Jordan imports 50,000 barrels of crude and 25,000 barrels of
fuel oil from Iraq daily to meet all its domestic needs, under an
exemption granted by the U.N. Sanctions Committee.
</P>
<P>
The committee is overseeing the enforcement of international
sanctions imposed on Iraq in 1990. The kingdom is getting the
Iraqi oil on concessional terms.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Iraq has been trading oil for food and medicine, but
Baghdad has run up a debt of about 1.2 billion dollars to Jordan
in unsettled payment for Jordanian exports to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Jordan was compelled to import oil from Syria and Yemen for a
short period of time in early 1991, when Iraqi oil installations
were damaged by allied bombings during the 1991 Gulf war to drive
out Iraqi troops from Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
However, it is very difficult and costy for Jordan to transport
Syrian and Yemeni oil to the kingdom on the basis of cash payment.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia closed an oil pipeline to Jordan in September
1990 because of Amman's approach toward the Gulf crisis. The two
countries have recently agreed to warm up their ties, but the oil
pipeline has to reopen yet.
</P>
<P>
Even if the Saudis were to reopen the pipeline, they would
demand globally-recognized market prices and cash payment for the
oil, observers here noted.
</P>
<P>
The minister of energy and mineral resources said earlier that
the government was anxious to ensure that two foreign companies
would start oil exploration in Jordan as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The government has signed agreements with two U.S. companies
but the accords are subject to parliamentary approval.
</P>
<P>
Interest has been mounting in Jordan over prospects of oil
finds in the Dead Sea after Israel announced last month that one
of its companies had found oil in the Israeli side of the Dead
Sea and that crude oil had started flowing there at around 450
barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
Dabbas affirmed that there were positive indications of oil
reserves in Jordan, especially in the Dead Sea area.

<HEADLINE> China Opposes US Cut of China's Textile Export Quota (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the Ministry
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation said here today that
China will by no means accept the US unilateral action of cutting
China's textile export quota by 195,001 dozen.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the cut is a severe violation of the
textile agreement reached between China and the United States, for
it is a unilateral action taken by the US government without
presenting ample evidence or without full consultations.
</P>
<P>
The US government announced on September 6 that it would cut
its import quota of this year's 13 categories of textiles from
China by 195,001 dozen and 134,029 kilograms, due to the alleged
transhipment of Chinese textile products.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that, at the end of October 1995, the US
side presented a number of illegal textile transhipment cases to
China. After that, the Chinese side made a careful
investigation. The two sides exchanged views in Beijing between
March 25 and 27 this year, conscientiously checking related
materials of these cases.
</P>
<P>
However, the US side did not offer ample testimony before the
consultation. Included were a number of cases, which gave only
rough situation without a clear and definite clue and specific
evidence.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, viewing from the materials provided, some cases were
plotted by either people engaged in transhipment or importers, and
some by people engaged in transhipment in collaboration with
importers. The Chinese enterprises were purely innocent during the
whole transaction.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side emphasized many times during the talks that
both sides should take a realistic approach, follow the spirit of
the Sino-US agreement on textiles, and draw a distinction of
responsibility between the importers, exporters or a third party,
on the premise of providing full evidence, while handling a case.

<HEADLINE> China Opposes US Cut of China's Textile Export Quota (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To further check the cases, the Chinese side wrote to the US
side on April 26 for more evidence. To date, however, the US side
has not provided any but instead made unilateral deduction. The
Chinese government will by no means accept it.
</P>
<P>
The Spokesman pointed out that the US government has
continuously placed obstacles to China's export of textiles to the
United States in recent years, severely hindering the Sino-US
textile trade.
</P>
<P>
Now it has unilaterally cut its textile import quota from
China without any reason and openly violated the textile agreement
reached between China and the United States. People can not help
but ask whether the US government really has sincerity to develop
Sino-US bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the Chinese side hopes that the US
government will reconsider its decision, with a stand conducive to
the development of the Sino-US trade, and cancel the deduction
action.
</P>
<P>
If the US side is really sincere about addressing the issue of
transhipment, the Chinese side is willing to conduct another
consultation with the US side in accordance with the related
stipulations of the Sino-US agreement on textiles so as to
produce a mutually acceptable result.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, he said, the Chinese government will have to make
further responses, and the US side will have to be responsible for
all consequences arising therefrom.

<P>
MANILA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' gross domestic
product (GDP) is expected to grow by more than six percent on
average in the next few years, an international investment firm
predicted in a report.
</P>
<P>
In its latest assessment of the Philippine economy, the
US-based investment firm Merrill Lynch predicted that the
country's GDP would grow by 5.9 percent this year, 6.4 percent
next year and 6.8 percent in 1998.
</P>

by growth in exports of manufactured goods and services as well as
the surge in demand coming from consumers, the government and
businesses, it said.
</P>
<P>
While the country's import growth is expected to taper off to
19 percent in 1997 and 15 percent in 1998 from this year's 25
percent, export would grow by an average of 21 percent in the
1996-1998 period, the firm said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine National Economic and Development Authority said
earlier that the country's real gross national product (GNP) grew
by 7.7 percent in the second quarter of this year from a year
earlier, pushing first half GNP growth to 7.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Bahraini FM Leaves for Saudi Arabia for GCC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Bahraini Minister of
Foreign Affairs Mohammad Bin Mubarak Al-Khalifa left Manama this
morning for Riyadh, to attend a foregin ministers' meeting of
the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said that the Bahraini minister will
attend the 60th session of the foreign ministers of the GCC,
which is due to be held in the Saudi capital today.
</P>
<P>
The GCC foreign ministers are scheduled to discuss a number of
political issues on top of which are the recent developments of
the situation in the Gulf region, particularly in Iraq, and the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. forces in the Gulf launched three rounds of cruise
missile strikes this week at some air defense targets in southern
Iraq in retaliation for Iraqi government troops' attack against
a Kurdish faction in the north.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, despite the U.S. attacks,
announced Tuesday that he would no longer recognize the United
Nations-sanctioned ban on Iraqi military in southern and
northern Iraq, saying, "From now on, pay no attention to the
imaginary no-fly zones above the 36th parallel and below the 32
parallel."
</P>
<P>
The member states of the GCC which groups Bahrain, Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, the United Arab Emirate, and Qatar, will
try to adopt a unified position on the situation in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Most of the GCC members have kept silent toward the recent
U.S. missile strikes against Iraq so far.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Closes Embassy in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has closed down its
diplomatic mission in Canada because its economy can no longer
sustain the maintenance of a large number of diplomatic missions
and personnel abroad, according to press reports today.
</P>
<P>
Although a Foreign Ministry statement said Friday the decision
to shut the embassy in Canada was without prejudice to existing
relations, agreement or ongoing programs between the two
countries, observers believe it has something to do with
Canada's touch stand against Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries have been fraught with
diplomatic hiccups following Canada's consistent calls for
sanctions against Nigeria over human rights record which forced
the Commonwealth to suspend Nigeria last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the statement said due consideration may be given to
the option of opening a diplomatic mission in Canada in future,
should the circumstance improves.
</P>
<P>
Canada has in recent months maintained a hostile attitude to
Nigeria, especially within the Commonwealth Ministerial Action
Group.
</P>
<P>
Last June, when the group decided to stay further action
against Nigeria after listening to a high-level delegation's
report on the country's human rights situation, Canada said it
was going ahead to impose some more sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Exworthy announced
the cancellation of the proposed visit to Nigeria by the
Commonwealth group amid misgivings by the Nigerian authorities.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait MP Candidates Registering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Candidates to take part
in the upcoming parliamentary race are registering for the polling
scheduled to take place on October 7, according to official
sources today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that by the end of working hours Friday, 133
candidates had filed their nomination papers.
</P>
<P>
The registration will continue until September 14, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
There are 50 seats in the Kuwaiti National
Assembly. Unofficial estimates put the number of candidates for
the October elections at more than 300, compared to 304 in 1992
and 533 in 1981.
</P>
<P>
The sources said government departments in charge of
organizing elections have accomplished preparations for the
one-month election season.
</P>
<P>
They said a total of 30,000 voters have been added to the
electoral list this year, increasing the number of eligible voters
to 167,169, about 20 percent of the Kuwaiti population. So far
women are still denied the right to vote in the emirate.
</P>
<P>
The voters will choose 50 deputies in 25 constituencies, two
from each, for the next four years.
</P>
<P>
About 20 percent of the candidates are contesting for the first
time, while the rest are either current members or former members
of the parliament or those who failed in the previous elections.
</P>
<P>
Four cabinet ministers who would take part in the elections
have quitted their posts according to law.
</P>
<P>
Candidates of the forthcoming elections complain that two
important factors which pose problem to them are the absence of
political parties and lack of women's right to vote in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The absence of political parties force parliament members to
vote in favor of a certain trend and some of them feel that
democracy is incomplete without such parties.
</P>
<P>
Absence of political parties in the country has led to the
establishment of certain political and social groups such as
Democratic Forum (liberal), Islamic Constitutional Movement
(conservative Sunni), Islamic Shi'ite Bloc (Shi'ite Muslim) and
Islamic Coalition (Fundamentalist Sunni).
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti Interior Ministry has formed a committee to
supervise the upcoming elections. The committee was empowered to
take preventive and practical measures to streamline the elections
and create an atmosphere of security and safety, official sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it is learnt that the committee has agreed on
harsher penalties for vote-buying, raising the jail term from one
year to three years and a fine from 100 to 2,000 Kuwait dinars
(330 to 6,600 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Debates about poor performances on various issues by the
outgoing parliament have been under way since last month. A
survey conducted recently by a local Arabic daily showed that
opinions regarding the present parliament have been at its lowest
and expectations are high as far as the performance of the next
Assembly is concerned.

</P>
<P>
Dwelling on the soaring price of sugar after the flooding in

measures to stabilize the situation.
</P>
<P>
''We are making energetic efforts to control the
'sky-rocketing' price of sugar by distributing available stocks
through agents and importing over 30,000 tons of the commodity as
buffer stock,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
Abraha also disclosed that a technical committee has been
established at the national level to rehabilitate the Wonji Sugar
Factory and others and make them operational as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Iran, South Africa to Boost Oil Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Oil Minister Golamreza
Aqazadeh announced here that Iran and South Africa are to expand
ties in the field of oil and will undertake some joint ventures
in this connection, according to a local press report today.
</P>
<P>
This announcement was made on the eve of Iranian President
Hashemi Rafsanjani's visit to South Africa and it was published
in the English-language daily Tehran Times today.
</P>
<P>
He said that oil experts of the two countries are working on an
important project on natural gas, adding that Iran and South
Africa will sign a memorandum of understanding in this respect.
</P>
<P>
However, he gave no details about the project.
</P>
<P>
Iran, the fourth largest oil producer in the world, pumps out
3.6 million barrels of oil per day (bpd) and exports 2.5 million
bpd in accordance with the quota of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
Iran's oil reserve stands at 92 billion barrels and the
country can maintain oil production for at least 70 years.
</P>
<P>
Last month, U.S. President Bill Clinton signed the D'Amato bill
into a law to punish non-American companies which invest
annually at least 40 million U.S. dollars in the gas and oil
sectors of Iran and Libya.
</P>
<P>
Aqazadeh said President Rafsanjani's current visit to South
Africa would pave the way for further cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian oil minister reiterated that Iran supplies some 70
percent of South Africa's oil requirements, adding that the
African state is not indebted to Iran for its oil purchase.
</P>
<P>
Oil refineries in South Africa are run by both private and
public sectors, he said, pointing out that the Iranian Oil
Ministry has held several rounds of talks with the officials of
the two sectors.
</P>
<P>
On Iran's cooperation with the Caspian Sea littoral states in
the oil sector, Aqazadeh said that Iran and Azerbaijan have taken
important steps to boost mutual cooperation in the sector in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
The minister added that setting up the Caspian Sea consortium
will prepare the ground for further cooperation among the regional
countries, but he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the expansion of ties among the Gulf and
Caspian Sea littoral states will contribute to the prosperity of
the region.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Urges for Early Implementation of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has urged for an early
implementation of the Iraq-U.N. oil-for-food deal, fearing further
delay in this respect would cause it more economic losses.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller has
sent two letters separately to U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Secretary of State Warren Christopher, expressing anxiety for the
delayed implementation of the U.N. Resolution 986, Semi-official
Anatolia News Agency reported late Friday night from Washington.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, adopted in April 1995, allows Iraq to export a
total of 1 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil every three months to
pay for its badly needed food and medicine. However, Washington
tried to block the enforcement of the deal after Iraq sent troops
to fight a Kurdish faction in the north early this month.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. launched three rounds of missile attacks on targets in
southern Iraq early this week and spearheaded an anti-Iraqi
campaign in the U.N..
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Acting Spokesman of the State Department
Glyn Davies as saying that Ciller sent a letter to Christopher on
September 1 and another to Clinton three days later, hoping to
hold talks on the U.N. Resolution and other issues between
Turkey and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Davies said that the United States and Turkey would hold
talks on these issues next week and first of all, the U.S.
Ambassador to Turkey Marc Grossman would make contacts with the
Turkish officials.
</P>
<P>
Ciller has said that Turkey's losses had amounted to
approximately 27 billion U.S. dollars since the implementation
of U.N. sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey is also holding serious negotiations with the U.N.
and Iraq regarding the implementation of the oil-for-food deal,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Undersecretary of the Turkish Foreign Minister
Onur Oymen met with the ambassadors to Turkey of the member
states of the U.N. Security Council, informing them that the
closure of the Kirkuk-Yumurtalik oil pipelines linking Turkey and
Iraq severely hurt the Turkish economy.
</P>
<P>
Turkey asks for immediate resumption of oil flow through the
pipeline, she stressed.
</P>
<P>
On august 12, Turkish Justice Minister Sevket Kazan and
Education Minister Mehmet Saglam visited Baghdad to hold
talks with high-ranking Iraqi officials on means of boosting
bilateral ties in the fields of trade, economy and politics.

<HEADLINE> New ICA Chairman on World Archives Development Strategy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The International Council on
Archives (ICA) is scheduled to give more attention to promoting
the development of archival work in developing countries, and take
full advantage of advanced information technology to upgrade the
level of the world archival work, said Wang Gang, new chairman of
the ICA.
</P>
<P>
The ICA announced today at the 13th International Congress on
Archives, that Wang Gang, director of China's State Archives
Bureau, is to replace Jean-Pierre Wallot, head of the Canadian
State Archives, as the chairman of the ICA in the next four years.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for a head of archival sector in a
developing country to serve as the chairman of the ICA.
</P>
<P>
Wang noted that due to economic and geographical reasons, the
level of archival work in developing countries still lags behind
that of developed countries, adding that co-operation between
developing countries and developed ones is crucial for the
improvement of the general level of the archival work in the world.
</P>
<P>
He said that the future work of the ICA is to serve for "peace
and development", the two themes of the current world, and manage
to make the importance of archives acknowledged by governments of
different countries, as well as the whole society.
</P>
<P>
Wang stressed that the ICA will actively participate in the
"World Memory", a project initiated by the United Nations
Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, which aims to
rescue the endangered archives, improve the maintenance work of
archives and protect the valuable historical heritage and cultural
treasures of mankind.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Taka Faces Another Minor Devaluation </HEADLINE>

<P>
DHAKA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi taka undergoes
another minor devaluation by 15 paisa (one taka equals to 100
paisa) against the US dollar with effect from today, Bangladesh
Bank sources said.
</P>
<P>
The devaluation, the third since July, is designed to make the
country's exports more competitive in the international market,
besides curbing the rising trends of imports, said the sources.
kkvkvvkkvkk
</P>
<P>
As the devaluation takes effect, the price of one US dollar
will stand at taka 42.20 for buying and 42.40 for selling by the
central bank.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi exporters have long been demanding a substantial
devaluation of taka on the plea that their exports were losing
competitiveness since India and Pakistan -- the country's major
competitors -- have already devalued their currencies.
</P>
<P>
The taka has undergone devaluation nine times since September
1995 and sources believed similar devaluation could be expected in
the months ahead.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
fixed the target for export earnings at 183.96 billion taka (about
4.38 billion US dollars) for the current fiscal year as of July 1.
</P>
<P>
According to the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB), the export
earnings in the last fiscal year stood at 3.88 billion US dollars,
showing a growth of more than 11 percent over the previous fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
"If we can achieve this target this year, it will be a 21
percent growth over the earnings of fiscal 1995-96," said an
official of the EPB. He expressed the hope that it would be
possible to achieve the target if political stability continues.
</P>
<P>
The official also hoped that export of traditional items which
are mainly agricultural products might increase this fiscal.
Export of these items was less in the last fiscal due to poor
procurement as a result of political stalemate.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government fixed the target at 2 billion US
dollars from the ready-made garments, which earned 1.94 billion US
dollars or more than half of the total export earnings in the last
fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> Christopher Calls for New Atlantic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher stressed today in a speech that NATO must transform
itself fundmentally to meet post-Cold War challenges in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The transformation will make NATO's eastward expansion easier,
Christopher said in his speech delivered today in Stuttgart
marking the 50th anniversary of an address in the city by former
Secretary of State James Byrnes on reconstructing Europe after
World War Two. Byrne's historic speech was a turning point in the
U.S.-German relations.
</P>
<P>
Byrnes made it clear that the United States, which isolated
itself after World War One, would keep engaged in Europe and
firmly support the restoration of German political and economic
unity.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Christopher outlined the U.S. vision of a "new
Atlantic community" but said it could not be achieved without
Washington's European allies acknowledging Russia's important role
in the new community.
</P>
<P>
He appealed fervently to the people of Russia "to participate
as a full partner in the construction of a new Europe without
tyranny, divisions or wars."
</P>
<P>
He proposed that NATO's cooperation with Russia should be
established in a formal charter.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's admission into the European integration process
should be included in the objectives for the years to come.
</P>
<P>
Christopher said that the final aim of a "new NATO" was to
accept all (Western) countries, including Spain and France, as
full members of the alliance's military wing.
</P>
<P>
He said a NATO summit meeting will be held early next year in
response to President Bill Clinton's proposal to discuss accession
negotiations of the first new members.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary of state arrived here today after visiting
London and Paris.
</P>
<P>
His Europe tour has been shadowed by the crisis over Iraq. He
had to make explanations defending U.S. air strikes against Iraq,
which took place twice at the beginning of this month in
retaliation for Iraqi attacks in the Kurdish-controlled areas in
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Before he made the Stuttgart speech, he had met German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and
exchanged views with them on issues of the Iraq crisis, NATO's
eastward enlargement and Kohl's visit to Russia on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He appreciated the German government for its support of the
U.S. military actions against Iraq, calling Germany the "core
partner" of the United States among its European allies.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the anniversary, Kinkel stressed that NATO's
"strategic partnership" with the United States would remain the
"core" of European security well into the next century.
</P>
<P>
He noted that NATO and a good relationship with the United
States, like the special ties with France and the policy of
rapprochement with Israel, were "unwritten Constitutional
articles" for Germany.
</P>
<P>
He also said that NATO should achieve a breakthrough in its
dispute with Moscow over the alliance's eastward expansion by the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The military organization must reach an understanding with
Russia on the principles of its eastward expansion and
establishment of security partnership, Kinkel stressed.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Demands Resignation of CEC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- the opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) Friday demanded immediate resignation of
chief election commissioner (CEC) Abu Hena for his "partisan role"
in the by-election held on last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Either the CEC has been intentionally playing a partisan role
or he is unable to conduct fair election," claimed BNP Secretary
General Mannan Bhuiyan at a press conference, who also demanded
repolling in two constituencies for massive rigging and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday's parliamentary by-election in 15 constituencies,
the BNP only got 3 seats while the ruling Awami (people's) League
(AL) bagged 8 seats.
</P>
<P>
Abu Hena has announced that the by-elections were free, fair
and transparent and brushed aside BNP's allegation of massive
rigging and intimidation to voters.
</P>
<P>
The BNP planned to hold a rally and bring out a procession in
the capital city of Dhaka today to protest the "mock by-election",
and it urged the people to stage rallies and bring out processions
across the country on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
BNP General Secretary Mannan Bhuiyan threatened to announce the
next course of action if the CEC did not resign immediately and
repollings at Laxmipur and Mirersarai constituencies were not
arranged.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ruling AL in a statement Friday termed the BNP's
allegations as "misleading" and urged the BNP to accept the
people's verdict.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today
announced the approval of two separate credits for Nepal and the
Republic of Yemen.
</P>
<P>
A credit of 18.28 million U.S. dollars is for Nepal's
three-part project designed for improving water supply and
sanitation.
</P>
<P>
The first part will establish and operate the Nepal Rural Water
Supply and Sanitation Fund Development Board, which will have
overall responsibility for the project. The board will allocate
public resources for the construction of water supply and
sanitation schemes and will select support organizations and
schemes, monitor and evaluate activities.
</P>
<P>
The second one will finance improvement of water supply and
sanitation services for 550,000 people in 900 rural communities.
The third will finance studies, preparation of a follow-up project
and sector monitoring and evaluation.
</P>
<P>
Another credit of 7.1 million Special Drawing Rights which is
equivalent to some 10.3 million dollars at present for Yemen will
be used to reduce water shortage and identify new water sources
for the city of Taiz, 200 kilometers south of the Western Asian
country's capital Sana.
</P>
<P>
The three-part project will consist of well drilling and
conveyance, a compensation package for the people in the Habir
area which will be giving up water for Taiz and technical
assistance and studies.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Agrees to Relocate Heliport in Okinawa: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. military in Japan has
told the Japanese government that it could move the Marine
heliport at the Futemma base in Okinawa Prefecture to another base
on the southwestern island in Japan, the Kyodo News Service
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The development could pave the way for Tokyo and Washington to
reach agreement on a new home for the Marine heliport, a
prerequisite for the closure of the Futemma base under a
Japan-U.S. agreement reached last April, Kyodo quoted government
sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
But the sources added that it remains uncertain whether the two
sides could reach a final agreement on the issue because Tokyo has
yet to receive a formal reply from the U.S. Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
Japan has floated the idea of relocating the heliport to the
Kadena base, but the U.S. had been hesitant to accept the proposal
for safety reasons.
</P>
<P>
Japan has also put forward a proposal to relocate a golf course
and housing units within the Kadena base to build a heliport, but
the U.S. informally indicated that it will move the heliport to
the coastal area of Camp Schwab in central Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
Japan rejected the U.S. proposal on the grounds that it
requires land reclamation opposed by local residents.
</P>
<P>
A working-level meeting of a bilateral special action committee
on Okinawa is to be held in Tokyo next Wednesday to find ways to
consolidate and reduce U.S. forces in Okinawa, home to 75 percent
of U.S. military facilities in Japan.

security" for the president, vice president, Cabinet secretaries,

<HEADLINE> Albania's Assembly Approves Memo on Gold With Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The Albanian Assembly today
approved the memorandum of understanding the government signed
with Britain on returning seized gold to Albania.
</P>
<P>
Britain, together with the United States and France, will
return to Albania the 1,574 kilograms of gold which has been in
the custody of the three allies since the end of World War II,
according to the memorandum and two other similar memoranda
Albania signed with the U.S. and France respectively.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Albania will pay Britain 2 million U.S. dollars in
indemnity and pay back the confiscated U.S. property in the
country.
</P>
<P>
In the 1940s, when the world war was to come to a close, Nazi
Germany looted from Albania 1,574 kilograms of gold (worth about
20 million dollars) which it had stored in Rome and was then
confiscated by the allies at the end of the war.
</P>
<P>
In 1946, two British ships were torpedoed with 46 seamen killed
in the Corfu Straits, a narrow channel between northeast Corfu
Island, Greece, and the southwest coast of Albania.
</P>
<P>
Britain accused Albania of torpedoing the ships and brought a
suit to The Hague International Court, which ruled that Albania
should pay back Britain in indemnity, but Albania refused.
</P>
<P>
Britain seized the gold, which was later put into the custody
of the three allied nations.
</P>
<P>
After decades-long negotiations, Albania reached a memorandum
of understanding with Britain in May 1992, and similar memoranda
with the U.S. and France in 1995 and 1996, paving the way to a
thorough settlement of the issue which has remained unsolved for
50 years.

<HEADLINE> Rio Group Seeks Way to Confront U.S. Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The Rio Group member
countries will analyze their position after their rejection of the
Helms-Burton Law which was imposed by the United States to tighten
embargoes against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The 14 Rio Group member countries, which gathered this week in
the Bolivian city of Cochabamba, discussed a report of the
juridical commission of the Organization of American States (OAS),
which unanimously agreed that the Helms-Burton Law has violated
international law.
</P>
<P>
The Rio Group rejected the U.S. law in a declaration issued at
the end of its two-day summit which ended on Wednesday. It said
the law contravenes norms governing the relations of countries
living in peaceful co-existence and ignores the fundamental
principle of respect for sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican Foreign Minister Fernando Naranjo, who attended the
meeting representing the Central America, said "what is new is not
the rejection itself, but the OAS juridical commission report."
</P>
<P>
Naranjo stressed the importance of making the summit "the top
political forum for Latin America and the Caribbean."
</P>
<P>
During the summit, Naranjo met U.S. Ambassador to the United
Nations Madeleine Albright in Cochabamba. She explained to Naranjo
the U.S. policy toward Iraq, U.S. positions on U.N. reform, and
the election of a new U.N. general secretary.
</P>
<P>
On the election of a new U.N. general secretary, Naranjo said
Costa Rica was satisfied with the performance of the incumbent
U.N. chief Boutros Boutros-Ghali, but it accepted the right of
Security Council permanent members to veto any possible candidates.
</P>
<P>
"The United States has already stated it does not agree to
Ghali's bid for re-election, and the permanent members have the
right to veto him," stressed Naranjo.
</P>
<P>
Former Costa Rican President and Nobel Peace winner Oscar Arias
is a possible candidate, as acknowledged by Naranjo, but he added
that the position of his country is that Africa must have a second
opportunity at the head of the United Nations, as it has been a
tradition with this world body.
</P>
<P>
"Our position is that if there is no consensus on African
candidates, we would suggest open a period to present new
candidates," said Naranjo.
</P>
<P>
About the U.S. reaction to the Iraq events, he considered it
"excessive." He added that "we would have liked a negotiation
process rather than a military attack."

<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Many Honduran
entrepreneurs are linked to the drug business and obstacles to
examine their bank accounts have prevented the authorities from
stopping money laundering, a Honduran official said today.
</P>
<P>
Fidel Borjas, prosecutor in the combat against corruption, said
today that efforts are being made to stop drug trafficking, but
they can not crack down the mafia because of the lack of legal or
economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
Borjas, who just assumed the position of prosecutor in the
Public Magistracy, said the National Congress will approve a bill
in the coming days that will allow to examine bank accounts to
thwart money laundering and make confiscated assets go to the
state treasury.
</P>
<P>
The authorities to combat drug trafficking have to work not
only against transportation, warehousing and re-exportation of
cocaine toward the U.S. market, but also against the growing local
drug consumptions.

<P>
BUDAPEST, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The Hungarian government has
set the end of 1997 the deadline for its establishment of a market
economy and completion of the nationwide privatization process,
Hungarian Prime Minister Horn Gyula said today.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the goal, Horn said, the government should make
efforts to attract more foreign investment.
</P>

Only with the help of the developed countries could Hungary
continue promoting its economic development, the prime minister
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Hungarian people have already sacrificed a lot for
the change of the country's social system, but they still have a
long way to go before the country realizes the plan of setting up
a true market-oriented economy.
</P>
<P>
Horn also spoke highly of Hungary's decreasing budget deficit
and foreign debt in a recent period of time. He said the focus of
the government's future tasks is to improve the situation in

<HEADLINE> Athens Prosecutor Charges Against Onassis' Ex-Husband </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The Onassis Foundation
announced today that a public prosecutor of Athens had instituted
criminal proceedings against Thierry Roussel, the former husband of
the late Greek shipping heiress Christina Onassis, for perjury and
other offenses.
</P>
<P>
A press release said that "following a criminal complaint
filed by the foundation's president, two vice-presidents and
secretary general, the public prosecutor of Athens has instituted
criminal proceedings against Roussel for perjury, filing
of false charges and libelous defamation through the press."
</P>
<P>
It added that proceedings had also been initiated against
Roussel's attorney, Nestor Kouroakia, "for libellous defamation
through the press."
</P>
<P>
An Athens misdemeanors court last month rejected a lawsuit
brought by Roussel against the board of governors of the Onassis
foundation, which has administered the inheritance of Athina
Onassis, Roussel's daughter, since the death of her mother,
Christina, in 1988.
</P>
<P>
In the suit, Roussel had accused the board of breach of faith.

MANILA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- the Philippine government has
stopped sending Filipino workers to seven Mideast countries
following renewed conflict between the United States and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In a statement published here today, Felicisimo Joson, chief of
the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration, said that for
the time being, the government will not allow workers to go to
Jordan, Kuwait, Iran, Syria, Lebanon, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia,
which are near southern Iraq, because of the possibility of
another gulf war.
</P>
<P>
He said that the restrictions also cover about 500 workers
whose work and travel documents are being processed by the
administration.
</P>
<P>
Contingency measures have also been readied for 180,000
Filipino workers in the western province of Saudi Arabia bordering
Iraq should the U.S. bombing continues, he said.
</P>
<P>
The contingency measures include the evacuation of the workers
to safe areas and repatriation if needed, Joson said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government said Friday that Baghdad was pulling its
heavy forces from northern Iraq amid reported clashes between
rival Kurdish factions, but insisted "it had the right to launch

NEW YORK, September 6 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks rallied today
as interest rates eased after an anxiously awaited job report
offered some mixed signals on inflation.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average added 52.90 to 5,659.86.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-3 margin at
the New York Stock Exchange, with its volume totaling 348.68
million shares, down from 360.55 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index rose 3.03 to 352.67, and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 6.24 to 655.68.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 13.74 to 1,139.40, and the
American Stock Exchange's market value index rose 3.31 to 560.02.
</P>
<P>
Before the stock market opened, bonds nose-dived and quickly
snapped back as traders digested a report saying the nation's
unemployment rate plunged to a seven-year low of 5.1 percent in
August.
</P>
<P>
Bond yield backed down to about 7.11 percent by late afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The unexpectedly steep drop in unemployment -- from 5.4 percent
in July -- put the jobless rate at the lowest level since March
1989, and well below the range that most analysts say the economy
can maintain without inflationary pressures developing.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department also reported that its monthly survey of
employers showed a gain of 250,000 jobs in August, slightly higher
than expected, and that hourly earnings increased slightly.
</P>
<P>
Today's data fit with expectations that the central bank will
act by their next meeting on September 24, but calmed growing
fears that it will pursue a more aggressive course than usual.

<HEADLINE> Prevlaka Still Open Question to Yugoslavia, Croatia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Montenegrin Prime Minister
Milo Djukanovic said today that Prevlaka was not recognized as
Croatian territory under the agreement on normalizing relations
between Yugoslavia and Croatia.
</P>
<P>
"The mutual recognition of the two states does not apply to
Prevlaka," a strategic premonitory which controls Yugoslavia's
biggest Bay of Kotor in the Adriatic sea border between Montenegro
and Croatia, he said, adding that Prevlaka was still an open issue
in this agreement.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia, which consists of Serbia and Montenegro,
established diplomatic ties with Croatia on August 23, thus ending
the five-year hostility between the two powerful states in the
Balkan region. But a few problems, including the Prevlaka
peninsula, were not solved when the two countries recognized each
other and their current international borders.
</P>
<P>
Djukanovic said he fully shared the assessment made recently by
Montenegrin President Momir Bulatovic on the agreement between
Yugoslavia and Croatia, according to reports of the Tanjug news
agency from Podgorica, the Montenegrin capital.
</P>
<P>
Bulatovic said Prevlaka was described as an open issue in the
agreement, which gives room to prove with historical and other
arguments that this premonitory belongs to its natural hinterland
-- Boka Kotorska in Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
"The present solution to Prevlaka gives hope that the issue
will be successfully settled through diplomacy," Tanjug quoted the
Montenegrin prime minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Yugoslav government adopted a report of the
Foreign Ministry today, which says the agreement on a
normalization of relations between Yugoslavia and Croatia was a
confirmation of Yugoslavia's principled policy and its
constructive contribution to reinforce peace and stability and
create conditions for development and progress in the region.
</P>
<P>
The government said in a statement that the agreement was at
the same time "a huge step toward the further affirmation of
Yugoslavia in the world and enables its reintegration into
international institutions and organizations."

BELGRADE, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A total of 63,291 voting
papers filled out by Bosnian refugees in Yugoslavia were flown
today to Sarajevo by an Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe (OSCE) plane, an OSCE official said in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The head of the OSCE office for elections in Belgrade, Zivota
de Luca, said envelopes with voting papers were still arriving in
the OSCE office and all envelopes bearing September 3 as the
mailing date would be received and sent to Sarajevo by September
13, as they must be placed in ballot boxes on the election day.
</P>
<P>
The first post-war national elections will be held in Bosnia on
September 14, as stipulated in the Dayton agreement. But refugees
outside Bosnia cast their ballots in hosting countries between
August 28 and September 3.
</P>
<P>
A truck carrying sealed sacks filled with envelopes were
escorted to the Belgrade airport by de Luca and the president of
the Yugoslav government commission for assistance to refugees in
voting, Bratislava Morina, according to the Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
The shipment was accompanied by 30 OSCE supervisors who had
monitored the voting by refugees in Yugoslavia between August 28
and September 3, it added.

<HEADLINE> Over 1000 American Troops Said to Be Exposed to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A group of American
investigators for a presidential advisory panel has drawn the
conclusion that more than 1,000 American troops were exposed to
the deadly nerve gas sarin in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
The investigators said in a report released here Thursday that
the American troops were exposed to the nerve gas when they were
blowing up an Iraqi ammunition depot shortly after the Gulf War in
1991.
</P>
<P>
The report criticized the U.S. Defense Department for its
repeated denial of the incident, saying that the Petagon's
investigation was "superficial."
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging last month that it had known since November
1991 that Iraq stored nerve gas at its ammunition depot, the
Pentagon insisted that it had no idea that U.S. troops were
involved in the depot's destruction in March 1991.
</P>
<P>
The investigators of the U.S. President Advisory Committee on
Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses demand further inquiry by an
independent body rather than the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
In response, Stephen Jopseph, U.S. Defense Department's senior
health officer, said today that the Pentagon was willing to look
for a investigation into the matter.
</P>
<P>
But he refused to confirm the panel's conclusion that up to
1,100 American troops were exposed to the deadly nerve gas.

<P>
An Iraqi military spokesman said that the U.S. aircraft which
took off from Turkey made 16 sorties today over northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
While other fighters which took off from Kuwait and Saudi
Arabia also flew 64 sorties in the south of the country, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Iraqi airplanes "were not able to" intercept
or shoot down these American aircraft which violated Iraqi
airspace.
</P>
<P>
This was the first flight by U.S. aircraft over no-fly zones
since the U.S. announced the expansion of no-fly zone in southern
Iraq from 32 to 33 parallel which took into effect on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said in a televised speech on
Tuesday that Iraq would no longer recognize the UN-imposed no-fly
zones in the south and north of the country. He called upon Iraqi
soldiers to attack any U.S. airplane which violates its airspace.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. has threatened to resume air-raid against
Iraq if their airplanes were attacked.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Holds Biggest Mass Wedding Ceremony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A free mass wedding ceremony for
600 couples was held tonight at a Cairo stadium under the auspices
of Egyptian First Lady Suzanne Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony, the biggest ever in Egypt, was organized by
Egypt's Supreme Council for Youth and Sports (SCYS), which
sponsored and financed the wedding as part of its efforts to help
low-income young people.
</P>
<P>
Congratulating the 1,200 brides and bridegrooms, Mrs Mubarak
said the government spares no efforts in helping young people.
</P>
<P>
She said it is her pleasure to attend such a wonderful ceremony
that these couples will remember forever.
</P>
<P>
Abdel Moneim Emara, chairman of the SCYS, said the council
arranged the collective wedding to alleviate the burden of these
young people and help them at the beginning of their married lives.
</P>
<P>
Many people support the idea of mass wedding as most
bridegrooms in Egypt are over-burdened by marriage expenses,
including buying an apartment and furnishing it.
</P>
<P>
But the idea is also facing a strong opposition in this largely
conservative Moslem country.

<HEADLINE> Non-Aligned Countries Concerned Over Unbalanced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Information ministers of the
non-aligned countries have expressed their deep concern over the
unbalanced global information flow.
</P>
<P>
They noted that developed countries are employing their media
to disseminate false and distorted information of events taking
place in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
This was made public today in the final declaration issued at
the end of the fifth Conference of Ministers of Information of
Non-Aligned Countries (COMINAC V).
</P>
<P>
The participants agreed the normal development of the information
and communication field in non-aligned countries has been impeded
by the unbalanced global economic situation and the use of the
technological superiority of the west against non-aligned
countries.
</P>
<P>
They also criticized the use of unilateral coercive measures
by the west which violated international law and the Charter of
the United Nations against non-aligned countries.
</P>
<P>
The ministers agreed on the need for intensive research
efforts by non-aligned countries into the development of
communication technology and inter- and intra-regional cooperation
as a means of redressing the imbalance through an enhanced
outflow of information from developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that investment in information and communication is
of "paramount national interest as well as mutual benefit of
member nations", the ministers urged to intensify the struggle
for establishing the new world information and communication
order on the basis of the principles of independence, progress,
democracy and mutual cooperation.
</P>
<P>
They also stressed the need for south-south cooperation for
the attainment of the collective objective of redressing present
imbalance in the world information and communication order.
</P>
<P>
The ministers agreed to reduce dependence on the information
and cultural media of the industrialized nations by initiating
and supporting cooperative activities through fresh and dynamic
approaches to programming, message content and networking in the
media systems of non-aligned and other developing countries.
</P>
<P>
They urged that the views, models and perspectives of the
media of developed countries should not be allowed to unduly
determine the style and orientation of media policies in
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
To hit the goal, the ministers agreed to beef up the
non-aligned news agencies pool and broadcasting organizations of
non-aligned countries, and accelerate the setting up of the new
international information centers in different continents to
promote south-south cooperation in the field of information and
communication based on the principle of collective self-reliance.

<HEADLINE> Kemp Seeks Support From African-Americans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Jack Kemp, running mate of
the U.S. Republican presidential candidate, today called on the
African-American voters to support the Republican Party in the
November 5 elections.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a restaurant in Herlem in New York, Kemp said that
one of the Republican goals in the on-going presidential campaign
is to to get half of the black vote by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Admitting that the Republican Party had neglected American black
voters while Democrats took their support for granted, Kemp
stressed that he and Dole, former U.S. Senate majority leader,
will "compete for every single vote" of the African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
At the National Convention of the Democratic Party in Chicago
late August, leading African-Americans called on their fellows to
rally behind Bill Clinton, the incumbent U.S. president and
Democratic Party's candidate for the next four-year White House.
</P>
<P>
"It is not good that one party takes the African-American vote
for granted," Kemp said. "We may not get 50 percent right now, but
I think this country would be better off if both political parties
compete for every single vote."
</P>
<P>
Kemp, a former U.S. congressman and housing and city
development secretary for President Bush, has reportedly had a
wide sympathy in the African-American community by advocating the
inner-city enterprises programs aimed at helping black people.
</P>
<P>
The 61-year-old running mate said that he would seek to broaden
the appeal of the Republican Party beyond its traditional
constituencies while spreading the GOP gospel of lower income
taxes and higher family values.

<HEADLINE> Namibia to Monitor Delivery of Relief Supplies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Namibia's newly
established drought aid management has promised to decentralize
its functions to the regions to ensure relief supplies reach the
needy, the Southern African Broadcasting Association reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The new management, appointed by the Prime Minister's Office,
comprises the Ministry of Agriculture, the National Emergency
Management Unit, the National Economic and Policy Research Unit,
and regional and district structures, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The new body came after widespread allegations of corruption
in the delivery of relief supplies to the areas severely affected
by the long drought, said senior government officials, therefore,
close monitoring was one of its major responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Namibian President Sam Nujoma declared the
country a drought-struck nation and appealed for international
emergency assistance to avoid widespread famine.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Recover From Early Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Leading European stock markets
closed higher today, recovering from early drops and extended
gains on relief that August U.S. jobless figures posed no danger
of inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
British shares had hit a low of 3,856.8 earlier in the day,
sparked by a dive in U.S. Treasury bonds, before breathing a sigh
of relief to stage a recovery and closing up 5.8 points after
fears of sell-off in New York proved unfounded.
</P>
<P>
Wall Street confounded market analysts and staged a rally as
buyers shook off stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs figures.
</P>
<P>
In Germany, the Frankfurt market also dropped at first as
investors were sidelined ahead of this afternoon's U.S. employment
figures for August, but in later trading the market rallied and
ended up 10.19 points.
</P>
<P>
The Paris bourse surged above 2,000 and finished 8.52 points
higher at 2,004.74. Traders said that firmer domestic bonds and
gains on Wall Street helped the market overcome fears that the
French government's planned tax cuts would not be enough to
stimulate the economy.
</P>
<P>
London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading
British shares closed up 5.8 points at 3,893.0. The Frankfurt
DAX-30 index ended 10.19 higher at 2,542.74. In Paris, the CAC-40
share index finished up 8.52 at 2,004.74.

<HEADLINE> Perry: US Sees Positive Development in Northern Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The United States has seen
positive development in northern Iraq but is still closely
watching the situation in the region, U.S. Defense Secretary
William Perry said today.
</P>
<P>
"The latest information we have is that the mechanized and the
armored forces of the Iraqi troops have been pulling to the
south," Perry told reporters at the Pentagon. "The artillery
shelling of Charchamal has stopped. Generally, we see positive
development in northern Iraq."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. defense chief made the remarks when asked if the
United States was satisfied with Iraqi troops and weapons
withdrawal from the north.
</P>
<P>
The United States launched missile attacks earlier this week in
alleged retaliation of the incursion by Iraqi troops into northern
Iraq and their attacks against Arbil, controlled by a Kurdish
faction.
</P>
<P>
It also declared expansion of the "no-fly" zone in southern
Iraq. But Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has said that Baghdad will
no longer recognize "No-fly" zones enforced by the United States
and its Western allies in southern and northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Washington has warned that the United States would launch
new military strikes if Iraq refused to recognize the "no-fly"
zones.
