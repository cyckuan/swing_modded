<HEADLINE> Foreign-Born Have As Many Degrees  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Foreign-born residents of the United States
are about as likely as other Americans to be college graduates --
but the ones who don't have degrees tend to be less educated than
the rest of the population.
</P>
<P>
   The United States had 26.1 million foreign-born residents last
year, the Census Bureau reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau said 25.4 percent had a bachelor's degree or higher.
That compares to 25.2 percent of native-born Americans with
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   There are also wide variations among the foreign born.
</P>
<P>
   ''For example, the proportion with a bachelor's degree or higher
ranged from 45 percent among migrants from Asia to 11 percent among
those from Latin America,'' said Angela Brittingham, the report's
author.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that about 4 in 10 foreign-born adults had a
high school diploma only, compared with more than 6 in 10 for other
adults. Nearly 1 in 4 of the foreign-born adults had less than a
ninth-grade education, compared with 1 in 20 of the rest of the
25-and-over population.
</P>
<P>
   The Bureau's profile of foreign-born residents also reported
that:
</P>
<P>
   --The largest share, 34.1 percent, come from Central America,
including Mexico. Other areas of origin are Asia, 27.1 percent;
Europe, 16.1 percent; Caribbean, 10.5 percent; South America, 6.1
percent and other, 6.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   --The West is home to the most foreign-born, 39.3 percent of the
total, followed by the South, 26.5 percent; Northeast, 23.9 percent
and the Midwest, 10.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   --The longer a foreign-born person has been here the more likely
he or she is to be a citizen. Some 78.8 percent of those who
arrived before 1970 have obtained citizenship. The rate is 58.8
percent for those arriving in the 1970s and 33.7 percent for those
who came here in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   --Some 18.0 percent of the foreign-born live in poverty, compared
to 12.1 percent of the native population. Central Americans are
most likely to be in poverty, 27.5 percent. The lowest poverty
rate, 10.5 percent, was among Europeans.

<HEADLINE> Reporter not required to turn over notes from interviews with confessor </HEADLINE>
By BRENDAN SCHURR
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT LAUREL, N.J. (AP) - A reporter's notes from interviews
with a man who said a prominent Cherry Hill rabbi hired him to kill
his wife will remain confidential.
</P>
<P>
   A state Superior Court judge ruled Monday that Rabbi Fred J.
Neulander's desire to obtain the notes of Philadelphia Inquirer
reporter Nancy Phillips does not outweigh the protection of those
notes under New Jersey's so-called Shield Law. The law protects
reporters from having to reveal confidential information or
sources.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Faulk, lawyer for the Inquirer and Phillips, said the
newspaper and Phillips were pleased that the court ''has upheld the
newsperson's privilege by refusing to allow the defendant to
rummage through a reporter's confidential notes.''
</P>
<P>
   Neulander's lawyers, Dennis Wixted and Jeffrey C. Zucker, had
argued that Phillips should surrender her notes from all interviews
she had with private investigator Leonard Jenoff since the Nov. 1,
1994, killing of Carol Neulander in her Cherry Hill home.
</P>
<P>
   In hearings on the matter on Sept. 1, Faulk argued that the
information being sought was available by questioning Jenoff, who
confessed to his role in the killing.
</P>
<P>
   In her ruling, Superior Court Judge Linda G. Rosenzweig said
that Neulander's need for the reporter's notes ''is relatively
slight when compared to the arsenal of cross-examination material
already at his disposal.''
</P>
<P>
   Neulander's lawyers argued that information in the notes could
be crucial to their defense of the rabbi in the capital murder
trial.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said one of the central questions likely to be
foremost in the minds of the jury is why Jenoff, who was not
officially considered a suspect, would come forward and give
authorities an 89-page confession, unless his contention that he
was hired by Neulander was true.
</P>
<P>
   The rabbi's lawyers maintained that Jenoff was overcome by
Phillips' ''Svengalian presence and charm,'' and her assurances
''that he would become a hero by coming forth.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge acknowledged that it could be helpful to the rabbi's
case to learn if Jenoff confessed for some reason other than to
clear his conscience.
</P>
<P>
   But, she wrote, ''When it is remembered that there is no way to
know if she has even one single written note on the subject of
Jenoff's motivation for coming forward, the benefit, if any, to
Neulander from compelled disclosure is dwarfed by the enormity of
the harm that would result to the freedom of the press and to the
policies underlying the Shield Law.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips had interviewed Jenoff several times and was present at
an Audubon diner on April 28 when Jenoff told Camden County
Prosecutor Lee A. Solomon and a county detective that the rabbi
hired him to kill his wife. The Inquirer published her account of
Jenoff's confession.
</P>
<P>
   Wixted and Zucker had argued that Phillips waived her right to
protection under the law by arranging the meeting, thus becoming
''an agent'' of the prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   ''... such arguments are only a theory, a theory not supported
by any evidence in the record,'' the judge wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Wixted declined to comment on the ruling Monday, saying he
hadn't reviewed it closely. He said he and Zucker would decide in
the next several days whether to appeal the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Neulander, 59, has denied any involvement in his wife's death.
He is being held at the Camden County jail without bail.
</P>
<P>
   No date has been set for his trial. His lawyers have requested
that it be held outside of Camden County.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say Neulander arranged the murder so he could pursue
a romance with Philadelphia radio personality Elaine Soncini.
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff, 54, of Collingswood, has said the rabbi promised to pay
him $30,000 to carry out the plot. Jenoff and his alleged
accomplice, Paul Daniels, 27, of Pennsauken, have both pleaded
guilty to aggravated manslaughter and have agreed to testify
against Neulander.

<HEADLINE> Electronic tolls, and toll increases, coming Sept. 30 to Turnpike  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) - Early Sept. 30, the New Jersey
Turnpike is getting a long-awaited cashless toll system, as well as
its first toll increase since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The turnpike is the final major link in a system that allows a
motorist with a windshield-mounted electronic ''tag'' to travel
from Buffalo, N.Y., over the crossings to New York City, through
New Jersey and Delaware or across the Pennsylvania Turnpike without
reaching for a wallet.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're both excited and somewhat nervous, but somewhat
confident at the same time,'' turnpike executive director Edward
Gross said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He said the turnpike will be the first major highway in the
nation to implement ''value pricing'' - off-peak discounts, which
he termed a significant tool to ease congestion.
</P>
<P>
   The turnpike, used by 600,000 vehicles each weekday, is getting
the E-ZPass electronic toll system about 2&AMP;frac12; years later than
expected.
</P>
<P>
   With the toll increase, cash users will pay about 20 percent
more for cars, 13 percent for trucks. The increase is just 8
percent for E-ZPass holders during peak periods and weekends. Cars
with E-ZPass will pay current rates during off-peak hours, while
truckers using E-ZPass will pay 8 percent more.
</P>
<P>
   It now costs $4.60 to drive a car the entire 148-mile length of
the turnpike. Under the new rates, cash users will pay $5.50.
</P>
<P>
   The turnpike is the last of New Jersey's three toll roads to get
E-ZPass, and it posed a more complex challenge than the others.
</P>
<P>
   All 27 toll plazas on the turnpike will implement the cashless
system at the same time because the turnpike tolls are calculated
based on where a vehicle enters and exits the superhighway.
</P>
<P>
   The system should be completed this fall throughout the Garden
State Parkway, where tolls are assessed at each plaza, similar to
the Atlantic City Expressway, which got E-ZPass in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
   As at other highways along the Eastern Seaboard, lanes accepting
only E-ZPass tag holders will be marked by a yellow flashing light
and purple and white sign.
</P>
<P>
   The tags are read by an electronic scanner as the vehicle
passes, and the toll is deducted from the motorist's account. Each
toll booth will also have recording devices to catch toll cheats.
</P>
<P>
   The system in Delaware and New Jersey and the crossings to New
York cost $220 million to build and is expected to cost $300
million to operate over the next eight years, Gross said.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium of toll roads and the Port Authority of New York
and New Jersey hopes to recoup the money from $25 fines assessed
violators - formally called ''administrative fees'' - along with
income from renting excess capacity on its 400-mile fiber-optic
network.
</P>
<P>
   E-ZPass will debut on the turnpike on 120 dedicated lanes, with
41 others ready for use a backups. Eventually, all 344 toll lanes
will accept E-ZPass.
</P>
<P>
   The E-ZPass activation will occur early in the morning of Sept.
30, a Saturday, the lightest travel period. The exact time will not
be known, as all lanes will be rechecked that morning before
opening to the public simultaneously, Gross said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the delays, the state has imposed $4.8 million in
late fines on the E-ZPass installer, Adesta Communications Inc.,
formerly known as MFS Network Technologies. The company's parent,
Able Telcom Holding Corp., has had financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   No layoffs of full-time toll takers are planned, Gross said. A
hiring freeze on full-time collectors has reduced their numbers to
just over 500, compared to over 800 in 1993. Many of the 220
temporary collectors and some of the 650 part-time collectors will
be dismissed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The toll increase is to fund nearly $1 billion in turnpike
improvements. Tolls will increase again in 2003: car drivers will
pay 17 percent if they use cash, 10 percent more with E-ZPass at
peak hours and weekends, and 5 percent more off-peak.
</P>
<P>
   Truckers paying cash will see another 13 percent increase, or
just 8 percent with E-ZPass. Gov. Christie Whitman on Monday moved
to continue a discount system for truckers, which now will be
available only for E-ZPass users during off-peak hours.
</P>
<P>
   Truckers accumulating $50.01 to $200 in monthly tolls get a 7.5
percent discount. The next $300 worth of tolls are discounted 5
percent, and any tolls beyond $500 get a 2 percent discount.
</P>
<P>
   Peak hours are 7 to 9 a.m. and 4:30 to 6:30 p.m. Monday to
Friday, based on time of entry.
</P>
<P>
   E-ZPass tags may be ordered via the Internet at www.ezpass.com,
or by calling toll-free 1-888-288-6865 (1-888-AUTO TOLL).

<HEADLINE> Patriots Lead Jets After 3rd Q  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Troy Brown set up two of Adam
Vinatieri's four first-half field goals with long punt returns
Monday night, and the New England Patriots held on for a 12-7 lead
over the New York Jets after a scoreless third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots started the second half with a promising 12-play
drive to the Jets 11, but Vinatieri's bid for his fifth field goal
was deflected wide left from 29 yards with 9:14 left in the third
period.
</P>
<P>
   New England held the Jets to one first down in two possessions
in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's 38-yard punt return after Tom Tupa's 62-yard punt set up
the Patriots at the New York 34 late in the first half. New England
got a first down before settling for Vinatieri's 33-yard field
goal, giving the Patriots a 12-7 lead with 2:45 left.
</P>
<P>
   After Vinny Testaverde's 4-yard pass to tight end Fred Baxter
gave the Jets a 7-3 lead late in the first quarter, the Patriots
came back with a 62-yard drive in 13 plays. The 35-yard field goal
by Vinatieri pulled them within one with 12:23 left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Glenn caught passes of 5, 10 and 20 yards from Drew
Bledsoe in the drive.
</P>
<P>
   On the first play after the kickoff, Testaverde's pass was
intercepted near the sideline by Antonio Langham and returned 24
yards to the 14. But New England managed just 2 yards on a run and
two incomplete passes before Vinatieri kicked his third field goal,
a 30-yarder, for a 9-7 New England edge with 11:13 left.
</P>
<P>
   After holding the Jets three-and-out on their first possession,
New England got good field position with a 31-yard punt return by
Brown to the New York 44.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots stalled after a 19-yard pass from Bledsoe to Eric
Bjornson and an 11-yard run by Kevin Faulk got them to the 13.
Vinatieri's 32-yard field goal gave them a 3-0 lead with 9:51 left
in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets came back with a 74-yard drive in 12 plays for the
go-ahead touchdown. Testaverde twice converted third-and-long
plays, connecting with Dedric Ward for 25 yards and Vincent Brisby
for 18.
</P>
<P>
   On third-and-2 from the 10, Testaverde handed to fullback Richie
Anderson for 6 yards, and on second down from the 4, Testaverde
faked a handoff into the middle and passed to Baxter for the TD,
his third scoring reception in as many games against the Patriots.

Iraq Getting More Food to Civilians
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Iraq has considerably increased the amount of food
getting to ordinary people from the U.N. aid program but has refused to
cooperate with an investigation of the humanitarian situation in the country,
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Monday. In a report on the U.N. oil-for-food
program, Annan also pointed to the $1.5 billion worth of contracts that remain
held up in the U.N. committee that monitors sanctions against Iraq -- largely at
the request of the United States. The program lets Iraq sell its oil to buy
food, medicine and other goods for its people who have been under strict U.N.
sanctions since 1990.

Nuclear Scientist's Release Is Postponed

   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- The expected release of Wen Ho Lee was delayed
Monday as prosecutors and Lee's defense team haggled over a plea deal that would
release the jailed Los Alamos nuclear scientist. U.S. District Judge James
Parker gave no reason for putting off a scheduled court hearing until Wednesday.
Under the deal described Sunday by government sources, Lee was expected to drop
allegations that he was targeted because he is Chinese, claims included in a
lawsuit against the FBI and the U.S. Departments of Energy and Justice. His
attorney in the case, Brian Sun, said Monday that the lawsuit is ''still
viable.''

Gore Faults Hollywood on Violence
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore's vow to lean on Hollywood until it stops peddling
violent material to kids puts him loudly in league with poll-tested unease over
entertainment fare, and seemingly at odds with an industry that lubricates his
party and campaign with cash. Gore says he's giving the industry six months to
stop marketing violent movies, recordings and video games to underage youth. If
that doesn't happen, and he becomes president, he said, he would seek sanctions
against offenders.

Entertainment Execs Reject FTC Report

<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The entertainment industry rejected federal accusations
Monday that it sells violence to children in music, movies and video games, and
executives suggested they deserve praise for cleanup efforts rather than
government ''bludgeoning.'' Political leaders, including President Clinton and
the men campaigning to replace him, said the industry must do much more. Vice
President Al Gore suggested action should be taken if changes aren't
forthcoming.

Arizona Had Tire Trouble in 1996

<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- While Bridgestone/Firestone says serious safety concerns
arose only this year, the tiremaker took complaints of tread separations and
blowouts in Arizona seriously enough as far back as 1996 to send a half-dozen
engineers on a special inspection mission and to help pay for replacing a
wrecked vehicle. According to government officials and state records examined by
AP, the complaints by state agencies that relied heavily on light trucks were
numerous and specific in terms of pointing out problems of tread separation and
blowouts.

negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, however, Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Yasser Arafat are showing signs they are ready to turn a page -- Barak
to focus on domestic needs, Arafat possibly to defer his drive for Jerusalem to
his as yet undesignated successor.

<HEADLINE> IOC Chief Concerned With Greece  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Five months after warning that the 2004
Athens Olympics were in jeopardy because of chronic delays, IOC
president Juan Antonio Samaranch said Tuesday he remains concerned
whether Greece can meet its deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch said he and Jacques Rogge, the IOC official who
oversees the Athens preparations, were ''very much worried
regarding the timetables'' set for completing the sports venues.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to be very clear,'' Samaranch told Athens organizers
after their report to the International Olympic Committee general
assembly. ''You lost three years. Now you have only four years for
the organization of the games. That is really very difficult. But
we have the confidence you will get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogge said: ''The coming six months will be crucial. The
government must move forward the deadlines. On paper, the general
plan is sound. But it has to be implemented. Time has been lost in
the past, but no time can be lost in the future. The clock is
ticking.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogge noted that substantial progress has been made since April
when Samaranch said the Athens Games were in the worst
organizational crisis faced by an Olympic city in his 20-year
tenure. Samaranch called for ''drastic measures'' to be taken, and
would not rule out moving the games.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, the woman who led
Athens' successful bid for the games, was brought back to take over
the organizing committee, and Premier Costas Simitis assumed full
government responsibility for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is already yielding results,'' Rogge said. ''There is a
new dynamism ... and far more flexibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogge cited progress in key areas such as accommodations, noting
that Athens recently signed an agreement setting aside 90 percent
of the city's hotels for the games. But he said much remained to be
done.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still have serious concerns,'' Rogge said. ''There are very
tight schedules for the construction of the general infrastructure.
Twenty-five percent of the venues still have to be built in four
years. The Olympic Village has to be finished. This is quite a big
task for a country of 10 million people.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogge said the IOC had expressed disagreement with government
plans for construction of five venue clusters for 12 sports. While
the government has set May 2004 as the target date for completion
of the venues, the IOC wants them finished a year earlier so test
events can be held.
</P>
<P>
   In her report, Angelopoulos-Daskalaki promised to try to meet
the IOC's goals.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are really pushing very hard about bringing forward the
timetable,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The five venues concerned are those for yachting, rowing and
canoeing, equestrian, softball and baseball, and badminton and
fencing.
</P>
<P>
   Security has also emerged as a major issue, particularly since a
British diplomat was assassinated by an underground terrorist group
in Athens in June.
</P>
<P>
   Angelopoulos-Daskalaki said Athens had formed a special police
division for the Olympics and that 26 Greek security experts had
traveled to Australia to monitor operations during the games. She
said Greece recently signed a security agreement with the United
States and would complete similar deals with Britain and other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've made a great deal of progress in the last three
months,'' Angelopoulos-Daskalaki said. ''We are back on track.
Certainly there are obstacles still to overcome, a great deal of
work ahead, a marathon that lies before us. .. The most important
thing is that Greece is entirely committed and focused on hosting a
successful games.''

<HEADLINE> White Withdraws From Olympics  </HEADLINE>
By EDDIE PELLS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Morgan White, the youngest member of
the U.S. gymnastics team, withdrew from the Olympics on Tuesday
(Monday night EDT) because of a stress fracture in her left foot
and was replaced by someone even younger.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-year-old White has been bothered by the injury since last
month's Olympic trials. She sat out all but one of the events at
the team's exhibition in San Marcos, Texas, earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   The selection committee, headed by team coordinator Bela
Karolyi, unanimously picked second alternate Tasha Schwikert, 15,
to take White's place, even though she finished a spot behind first
alternate Alyssa Beckerman at the Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
   Schwikert was chosen because of more consistent performances at
the pre-Olympic training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have great confidence in Tasha's ability to step forward
and meet the challenge of helping this team compete for a medal in
Sydney,'' USA Gymnastics president Bob Colarossi said. ''Tasha has
proven herself throughout this entire year by always being ready
for significant competitions.''
</P>
<P>
   White left Sydney for Cincinnati late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It just got to the point that it was so painful, she wouldn't
have been able to compete at the level she wanted to compete,''
White's doctor, Timothy Kremchek, told The Cincinnati Enquirer.
</P>
<P>
   White won't require surgery. Kremchek said she left because she
doesn't want to distract the team.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Lee Tracy, the coach for White and Beckerman, had been
chosen as the U.S. assistant coach, a role she also filled in 1996.
But with no athletes on the team, she will be replaced by Steve
Rybacki, who coaches Jamie Dantzscher.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy will transfer her credential to Schwikert's coach, Cassie
Rice. Tracy and Beckerman were expected to stay in Sydney through
the team competition, which concludes next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   White was the all-around champion at last year's Pan American
Games. She finished fourth overall at the U.S. Olympic trials and
was one of Karolyi's favorites because of her consistency. A year
ago, she was a longshot to make the team. She made the U.S. World
Championship team as an alternate.
</P>
<P>
   But she made steady progress this year -- Tracy nicknamed her
''The Creeper'' -- and finished second to Russia's Yelena Produnova
at the prestigious American Cup in February, then validated that
success with good performances this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Schwikert inherits the title as the Olympic team's youngest
gymnast. Under new rules, she is allowed to compete because she
turns 16 on Nov. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Her selection revives debate over whether the committee made a
mistake by not picking Vanessa Atler as an alternate. Schwikert
finished ninth, three spots behind Atler at trials and has little
international experience at the senior level.
</P>
<P>
   With her bubbly personality and Mary Lou Retton-like charm,
Atler was expected to fill the void created when the Magnificent
Seven retired after winning gold at the Atlanta Olympics. She won a
share of the national title in 1997, but has faltered since. In
maybe his toughest decision, Karolyi left her off the team, and
didn't offer her an alternate's spot, after her disappointing
performances at nationals and trials.

   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Ken Griffey Jr. left Monday night's game
against Chicago after colliding at home plate with Cubs catcher Joe
Girardi.
</P>
<P>
   The Cincinnati outfielder had walked and was trying to score

<HEADLINE> Chinese Team Arrives in Sydney  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN LEICESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Nuns in brown robes, bank workers and
cordons of police greeted China's Olympic team, minus athletes who
failed drug tests, as it flew into Sydney on Tuesday (Monday night
EDT).
</P>
<P>
   Squat weightlifters, towering basketball players, lanky
volleyballers, swimmers, table tennis players, other athletes and
officials made up the more than 300-strong Chinese delegation that
arrived on a charter flight from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's exciting. We're finally here,'' said Yin Yin, a player on
the women's volleyball team that has medal hopes. China expects to
win 16 gold medals in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Missing, however, were 13 athletes, among them six runners
trained by famed coach Ma Junren, who were kicked off the team last
week for failing blood tests for the performance-enhancing drug
EPO.
</P>
<P>
   In all, China trimmed its team from 311 to 284 athletes,
although officials said not all failed blood tests and that some
were cut because of injury, poor performances and ill health.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials and athletes appeared reluctant Tuesday to
discuss the drug cases, or said they didn't know anything about
them.
</P>
<P>
   ''The spokesman of the Chinese Olympic Committee has already
given an explanation for this. It doesn't have much to do with
me,'' said Cai Jiadong, a fencing official.
</P>
<P>
   Police at Sydney's crowded international airport funneled the
Chinese delegation through a side door and onto waiting buses to
evade reporters and well-wishers who waited, flags in hand, in the
arrivals hall.
</P>
<P>
   But within a few minutes, the crowd caught on and rushed to
where the Chinese where being led out, leading to a brief melee as
police struggled to hold them back.
</P>
<P>
   ''Warm welcome from Buddha's Light, warm welcome from Buddha's
Light,'' chanted a half-dozen shaven-haired nuns from the Buddha's
Light International Association, a Taiwan-based group.
</P>
<P>
   Tall Chinese models in white track suits, as well as staff from
the Bank of China and Chinese who have emigrated to Australia waved
bunches of flowers and red Chinese flags as the team filed past.
</P>
<P>
   The men on China's team wore smart dark suits, the women dark
skirts with light cream suit tops. They carried sports bags
emblazoned with a fiery yellow-and-red dragon curled up to spell
''China.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen golds would match China's tally at the Atlanta Olympics
in 1996, when it ranked fourth on the medal table. China's biggest
medal hopes come in diving, weightlifting, table tennis and
badminton.

<HEADLINE> Phillies, Expos Split Doubleheader  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Geoff Blum atoned for his two errors in the
opener by hitting a go-ahead two-run homer in the eighth inning of
the nightcap Monday night, giving the Montreal Expos a 7-6 win over
the Philadelphia Phillies and a doubleheader split.
</P>
<P>
   Blum's first-inning errors in the opener led to four unearned
runs as the Phillies won 5-2 to eliminate Montreal from playoff
contention.
</P>
<P>
   With the Phillies leading 5-4, Brian Schneider hit a one-out
single off Ed Vosberg. One out later, Blum hit a drive to
right-center off Vicente Padilla (4-6) for his 10th homer.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos added an insurance run in the ninth when Terry Jones
doubled and eventually scored on a wild pitch by Wayne Gomes.
</P>
<P>
   Guillermo Mota (1-1) got the final out in the seventh for the
win, and Scott Strickland got three outs for his fourth save. Rob
Ducey hit a sacrifice fly in the ninth for the Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos scored solo runs in the third, fourth, fifth, sixth
and ninth innings.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Guerrero went 6-for-8 in the doubleheader, with a homer
in the first game and two RBIs in the nightcap.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Burrell had two hits and two RBIs for the Phillies after
sitting out the opener.
</P>
<P>
   In the first game, Cliff Politte (3-2) gave up two runs and six
hits in eight innings -- his longest outing in 14 career starts.
</P>
<P>
   The only runs Politte gave up came on solo homers by Guerrero,
his 36th, in the seventh inning, and Peter Bergeron in the eighth.
No other Expo advanced past second off of Politte.
</P>
<P>
   Blum's two errors in the first inning led to four runs. With two
outs and runners on first and second, Kevin Jordan hit a grounder
through Blum's legs and down the left-field line, scoring Kevin
Sefcik and Travis Lee.
</P>
<P>
   After an RBI single by Ducey and a single by Gary Bennett, Blum
fielded a grounder by Alex Arias, but threw it past first baseman
Andy Tracy, scoring Ducey.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies added a run in the third when Lee doubled and
scored on a sacrifice fly by Ducey.
</P>
<P>
   Dustin Hermanson (11-13), who had pitched his only shutout of
the season in Philadelphia in April, gave up one earned run, eight
hits and one walk in seven innings. He did not strike out a batter.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Brantley pitched the ninth for his 23rd save in 27 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal's second-game starter allowed three runs and three hits
in four innings. Randy Wolf gave up four runs -- three earned -- and
eight hits in six innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Philadelphia's Bobby Abreu left the second game after the
sixth inning with inflamation of the right elbow. His status is day
to day. ... The announced attendance was 11,310, although the
actual crowd was estimated at less than 6,000. This was despite a
half-price ticket promotion for the twinbill on a previously
scheduled offday. ...The first game was played in 2 hours, 13
minutes. ... The loss gave Philadelphia a 59-84 record, matching
the Cubs for the worst record in baseball. ... After popping up to
second base in the ninth inning of the second game, Guerrero got
ejected after arguing with home plate umpire Bill Welke.

<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Frank Thomas hit a grand slam and drove in five
runs, increasing RBIs total to a career-high 139 as the Chicago
White Sox beat Detroit 10-3 Monday night, sending the Tigers to
their sixth straight loss.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago, which has won four of five, increased its AL Central
lead to eight games over idle Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas hit an RBI double in the first and added a second grand
slam of the season in the eighth off Nelson Cruz. Thomas, who has
seven career slams, leads the AL with 42 home runs and his RBIs
total leads the major leagues. His previous career high was 134 in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Sirotka (14-10) won his fourth straight decision and
matched his career high in wins, set in 1998. He gave up three runs
and six hits in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Howry pitched two innings for his seventh save in 12
chances.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Moehler (12-8), who had won his six previous decisions,
allowed four runs and nine hits in five-plus innings, losing for
the first time in eight starts since Texas beat him on July 28.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Palmer's RBI single and Tony Clark's double that dropped in
front of a diving Carlos Lee in left put Detroit ahead 3-0 in the
first.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas doubled in the bottom half, and Magglio Ordonez pulled
the White Sox within a run with an RBI single in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Konerko doubled off the left-field wall leading off the
sixth and scored on Herbert Perry's game-tying single, chasing
Moehler.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Singleton sacrificed off C.J. Nitkowski, Charles Johnson
walked. Ray Durham grounded out, putting runners on second and
third.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Valentin then bunted and the ball dropped in front of a
diving Nitkowski. Catcher Brad Ausmus fielded the ball but
overthrew Clark at first for an error as Perry and Johnson scored,
one on the bunt, the other on the error.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Graffanino walked with the bases loaded in the eighth
before Thomas' slam.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Thomas hit slam off Baltimore on April 26. ... Plate umpire
Jerry Crawford left the game after the first with tightness in his
right hamstring. ... The Tigers have won 10 of their last 12 games
against left-handed starters. ... The White Sox are 6-1 against the
Tigers this year. ... Lee was selected AL co-player of the week
after batting .583 with two RBIs in six games last week.

   HOUSTON (AP) -- Barry Bonds tied the game with a two-run homer in
the ninth inning and Bill Mueller tripled home the go-ahead run in
the 10th Monday night, leading the San Francisco Giants over the
Houston Astros 8-7.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco, which led 5-0 before falling before 7-5, won for
the 10th time in 12 games and stopped Houston's six-game winning
streak. The Giants began the night with a 7&AMP;frac12;-game lead over
second-place Arizona in the NL West.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds tied the score in the ninth with his 45th homer, a drive
off Octavio Dotel, who blew a save for the fourth time in 17
chances.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Martinez singled off Mark Valdes (4-5) with one out in the
10th and, one out later, Mueller hit a pitch to right-center power
alley.
</P>
<P>
   Robb Nen (4-3) pitched 1 2-3 hitless innings for the win,
getting Moises Alou to hit into an inning-ending double play with
two on in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Lima, allowed homers to Jeff Kent and J.T. Snow, raising
his total to 44, two short of the NL record Robin Roberts set with
Philadelphia in 1956. Bert Blyleven set the major league record of
50 with Minnesota in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, in its first season at Enron Field, set a team record
for home attendance, drawing 35,130 to increase its season total to
2,728,739 Monday. The old mark of 2,706,017 was set in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hidalgo went 3-for-4, including his fifth homer in three
games. Hidalgo, 8-for-13 with seven RBIs in the three games,
homered in the third and appeared to hit another in the fifth, when
his drive went into the Astros' bullpen in right-center and hit the
top of a second fence in the bullpen, then bounced back on the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Second base umpire Brian Gorman ruled it in play and Hidalgo
wound up with a triple.
</P>
<P>
   Houston got home runs from Hidalgo, Jeff Bagwell and Alou,
increasing its total to 226, tying Toronto for the major league
lead. Alou became the first batter to hit the train high above left
field.
</P>
<P>
   Lima allowed five runs, seven hits and a career-high six walks
in 6 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Nathan, in his first start since July 13, gave up six runs
and five hits -- three of them homers -- in 2 1-3 innings. He was on
the disabled list with right shoulder inflammation from July
14-Aug. 18 and had made four appearances since then, all in relief.
</P>
<P>
   Kent hit a three-run homer in the first, raising his total to a
career-high 32, and Snow followed with a solo shot. It was the
third time this season the Giants hit consecutive homers.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants have 206 homers, the most they have hit in a season
since moving from New York to San Francisco after the 1957 season.
They hit 205 in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Kent's RBI single made it 5-0 in the second, but Hidalgo started
Houston's comeback in the bottom half with his 38th homer.
</P>
<P>
   Lima, just 8-for-53 at the plate coming in, doubled leading off
the six-run third and scored on a triple by Julio Lugo, who came
around when catcher Doug Mirabelli's pickoff attempt when the ball
went down the left field line for an error.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell followed with his 42nd homer, making it 5-4, and Alou
hit a two-run homer for a 6-5 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Del Toro relieved and walked Hidalgo, then gave up an RBI
double to Raul Chavez.
</P>
<P>
Notes: On Friday night, the Giants led in the sixth 7-1 before
losing 10-7. ... Kent's homer set a franchise record for home runs
by a second baseman, one more than 37 he hit in 1998. ... Hidalgo
stretched his hitting streak to a career-high 13.

<HEADLINE> IOC Lashes Back at Critics  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee,
under renewed attack for its anti-doping policies, says critics in
the United States and other countries should fix their own drug
problems before giving lessons to others.
</P>
<P>
   IOC members complained Tuesday about a study, financed and
released by the White House last week, that criticized the
international committee and other sports organizations for failing
to do enough to combat the use of banned performance-enhancing
drugs in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The report was prepared by Joseph A. Califano Jr., president of
the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse (CASA) at
Columbia University. The center conducted a two-year, $1 million
study of drug use in Olympic sports.
</P>
<P>
   IOC officials have called the report out of date, saying it
fails to take into account steps made in recent months. These
include formation of the World Anti-Doping Agency, approval of a
test for the banned drug EPO, implementation of unannounced
out-of-competition controls and appointment of independent
observers for the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand very well that many members of the IOC are not
happy with the attacks we are receiving day by day regarding the
doping fight,'' IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch told the
general assembly Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Without citing the United States by name, he said the
International Olympic Committee should take up the issue with
national Olympic committees in the countries ''that are giving us a
lesson every day, telling us what we have to do.
</P>
<P>
   ''Only if these countries are doing something in their own
country against doping can we accept this kind of lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC has frequently cited the absence of a comprehensive
anti-doping program in the United States, particularly in
professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. study triggered a backlash during a discussion on the
activities of the world anti-doping agency, which was created by
the IOC last year to coordinate out-of-competition testing.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't accept the attitudes of those national institutions
which want to give us lessons of behavior,'' Italian delegate Mario
Pescante said. ''You know who I am talking about.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot accept that a professor without any title can give
us lessons in the anti-doping fight. This so-called professor is
from a country that is not doing 10 percent of what the IOC is
doing. Those calling for others to put their house in order should
get their own house in order too.''
</P>
<P>
   IOC vice president Dick Pound, chairman of the world agency,
lamented the ''misinformation, often deliberate misinformation''
circulated about the IOC's anti-doping efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've taken the responsibility of putting our heads above the
parapets,'' he said. ''When you get your head up there, you become
a target and are often an unjustified target.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the U.S. study, Pound said: ''There's a great deal
of academic and scholarly rivalry out there. Scholars love to
debate with each other about who is right and who is wrong. The
ones who say everything is wrong tend to get a little more press
attention than those who say it's right.''
</P>
<P>
   Many IOC members consider the criticism from the United States
as being directed by Gen. Barry McCaffrey, director of the White
House drug policy office.
</P>
<P>
   But McCaffrey, once an outspoken IOC critic, has recently
praised the advances made by the organization in the anti-doping
field. His office has sought to distance itself from some of the
criticism contained in the new report, stressing that it was
prepared by an independent commission.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey spokesman Bob Wiener said Tuesday that McCaffrey
believed ''remarkable progress'' has been made over the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
   ''He believes the recent waves of busts and removals for doping
are the clearest signs that the IOC and WADA mean business,''
Wiener said.
</P>
<P>
   Pound said WADA has carried out more than 2,000 out-of-competion
tests around the world since April. More than a dozen positive
results have been recorded.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC came under new scrutiny after an Australian television
documentary, aired Monday night, charged the IOC approved an
ineffective test for EPO. Instead of selecting a method that can
detect use of the drug going back 28 days, the IOC opted for a test
that can only trace it back a few days, Australian scientists told
the program.
</P>
<P>
   But IOC medical director Patrick Schamasch said an independent
panel of scientists had found the other test unreliable, and that
positive results might not stand up to legal challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Said Pound: ''It's better to be conservative at the start and
expand in due course.'

<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Woody Williams pitched a six-hitter and John
Mabry's two-run single keyed a five-run first inning, leading the
San Diego Padres to a 7-2 win Monday night over the Colorado
Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's Todd Helton went 0-for-4, dropping his average to
.379. It hadn't been that low since Aug. 9, when it was .378.
</P>
<P>
   Williams (10-5) retired 16 consecutive batters before Todd
Hollandsworth homered with one out in the eighth. Williams struck
out four and walked none in his third complete game of the season.
He also had a run-scoring grounder in the third, giving him nine
RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Mabry's single was one of five hits against Julian Tavarez
(10-3), who allowed five runs, walked two and hit a batter as he
recorded just one out in the first inning. It was the shortest of
his 21 career starts.
</P>
<P>
   Tavarez lost for the first time in nine starts this season with
Colorado. He had been 5-0 with a 2.25 ERA, with the Rockies going
8-0 in his previous starts.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego loaded the bases in the first on Damian Jackson's
leadoff double, an infield single by Desi Relaford and a walk to
Ryan Klesko.
</P>
<P>
   One out later, Mabry lined a two-run single. Mike Darr and Eric
Owens followed with consecutive RBI singles. With runners on first
and third, Owens stole second base and Darr was credited with a
steal of home when he scored easily on the throw down to second.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado scored in the second on a double by Hollandsworth and
Brett Mayne's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego added its final run on Wiki Gonzalez's RBI single in

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Sidney Ponson stopped his three-game
losing streak with his fifth complete game of the season, and Jeff
Conine hit a solo homer Monday night as the Baltimore Orioles beat
the Anaheim Angels 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Ponson (8-11) scattered eight hits and struck out six, including
Mo Vaughn twice. Vaughn's AL-high strikeout total rose to 160.
</P>
<P>
   The complete game was the 13th by the Orioles this year, tying
Toronto for the major league lead.
</P>
<P>
   Ponson walked two in winning for only the second time in seven
starts since July 31, with four losses over that span. His previous
win was 2-1 over Kansas City on Aug. 20.
</P>
<P>
   He gave up the Angels' lone run on Garret Anderson's RBI single
in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Conine restored the Orioles' two-run lead in the sixth when he
connected off Scott Schoeneweis (7-8) for his 13th homer.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore had taken a 2-0 lead in the third when a double steal
led to a run.
</P>
<P>
   After Delino DeShields walked with two outs, Conine singled and
DeShields stopped at second. With Cal Ripken Jr. up, both runners
took off and catcher Bengie Molina threw to second, trapping Conine
in a rundown between first and second.
</P>
<P>
   But DeShields, who had slid head first into third, regained his
feet and headed for home. Vaughn made an off-balance throw from
first that sailed wide of Molina, allowing DeShields to score and
Conine to take third.
</P>
<P>
   Both runners were credited with steals; the run was earned since
it came on a fielder's choice.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore moved ahead to stay when Brook Fordyce drew a one-out
walk in the secondg, advanced to second on a balk by Schoeneweis
and scored on a single by Luis Matos.
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis gave up three runs and six hits in 6 1-3 innings,
leaving with muscle spasms in his back.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Troy Glaus became on the third player in the 40-year
history of the Angels to draw at least 100 walks during a season.
The others were Brian Downing in 1987 and Tony Phillips in 1995.
... Ripken beat out a grounder down the third-base line in the
eighth for his 3,053rd hit, tying Rod Carew for 20th on the career
list. ... Anaheim RHP Al Levine, a reliever pressed into starting
duty when Matt Wise came up with a sore elbow on Sunday, will get
another start Friday against Minnesota. Levine, who pitched four
scoreless innings in the Angels' 2-1 victory over Baltimore, this
time will replace the struggling Scott Karl in the rotation.

<HEADLINE> NATO To Increase Kosovo Troops  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VOULIAGMENI, Greece (AP) -- NATO will increase its troop strength
in Kosovo ahead of Yugoslav elections because of fears that
violence could break out, the alliance's military committee chief
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Admiral Guido Venturoni said an additional 2,400 troops would be
sent to bolster a force of about 40,000 NATO-led peacekeepers in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ''Important things will happen in the area,'' Venturoni told a
news conference, adding that NATO ''found the need to reinforce the
contingent there.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO's military committee was meeting at a luxury resort complex
in this Athens suburb to discuss regional developments and the
alliance's new force structure.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was attended by all of NATO's joint chiefs of staff,
including U.S. chairman Gen. Henry H. Shelton.
</P>
<P>
   Venturoni said the request was made by NATO's supreme commander
in Europe, Gen. Joseph W. Ralston, because of national elections to
be held in Yugoslavia on Sept. 24.
</P>
<P>
   ''There might be some violence, politically motivated
violence.'' Venturoni said about the decision to introduce more
troops. ''They are something to be sure that we can tackle all the
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Britain, Greece, France and Italy would supply the
troops, which would arrive shortly before the elections and leave
soon after. Greece's troops left last week.

<HEADLINE> Chile Marks Anniversary of Coup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets
to disperse students protesting at three Chilean universities
Monday to mark the 27th anniversary of Gen. Augusto Pinochet's
bloody coup.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said at least 25 students were detained after
seperate incidents flared in and around college campuses in
Santiago and southern Chile.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Concepcion, 300 miles southwest of
Santiago, 15 students were ordered held after occupying a campus
building and throwing rocks at police. Calm was eventually restored
on the pleas from the university rector.
</P>
<P>
   In Santiago, another 10 people were arrested after students at
the University of Santiago burned turns and blocked traffic. Across
town, some twenty masked students at the Metropolitan University of
Education hurled rocks and stones at police, who responded with
tear gas and water cannons.
</P>
<P>
   The incidents marred what was otherwise a day of peaceful
protests led by human rights activist and opponents of Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   Leftists and families of those who fell victim to the past
dictatorship recalled the day by laying a floral wreath at the foot
of the monument to President Salvador Allende, the former Marxist
leader, who committed suicide Sept. 11, 1973, the day of the
Pinochet-led coup on his presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet went on to rule for nearly 17 years. An official report
after Pinochet left power in 1990 said 3,197 people died or
disappeared under his right-wing military regime.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet and leaders of the armed forces have said all along
that there has never been any reason to ask forgiveness for what
occurred. The former dictator has said he was fighting to save
Chile from chaos when he took power.
</P>
<P>
   Currently mired in legal battles at home, Pinochet has been
stripped of the immunity from prosecution he had once enjoyed as a
senator-for-life. The Supreme Court earlier this year upheld a
lower court decision that could open the way for him to stand trial
for human rights abuses committed during his rule.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutor judge Juan Guzman is investigating some 170
criminal complaints that have been filed against Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, some 4,000 Chileans marched in remembrance of the
day, shouting slogans and calling for a trial for Pinochet.

<HEADLINE> NY Democrats Accused of Corruption  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- A local Democratic Party chairman was
charged with corruption Monday for allegedly making nearly $375,000
through fraud, extortion and bribery.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Adler, chairman of the Rockland County Democratic Party,
was charged in U.S. District Court with eight counts stemming from
three real estate transactions. A real estate broker, Adler is
accused of telling Democrats on the Planning Board they would lose
their positions if they opposed his deals.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also said another New York Democrat, Sean Purdy, was
charged with corruption after a 15-month investigation that started
when a member of another planning board reported he had been
offered a bribe. Purdy was suspended from his position as attorney
for the town of Haverstraw.
</P>
<P>
   ''Duty seemed not to matter to these defendants,'' U.S. Attorney
Mary Jo White said. ''Instead, they saw public service as a path to
private enrichment.''
</P>
<P>
   Adler, 42, and Purdy, 43, were brought to court Monday and
released without bail. They did not return calls to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Adler has been county chairman since 1996. He is a political
mover and shaker in Rockland, one of the suburban counties
considered key to the U.S. Senate race between Hillary Rodham
Clinton and her Republican opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio. In November,
Adler was the host for a fund-raiser for the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Levine, a spokeswoman for the Clinton campaign, said:
''Hillary knows this is a difficult time for Paul and his family
and she wishes them well.''
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Marr, spokesman for Lazio, said Clinton should
return a $1,500 donation from Adler and renounce him as an adviser.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Adler could face up to 60 years in prison and a $2
million fine while Purdy could face up to 10 years in prison and a
$500,000 fine, White said.

<HEADLINE> US Dollars Replace Ecuador Currency  </HEADLINE>
By CARLOS CISTERNAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- The American greenback ruled supreme in
this small Andean nation on Monday, the first day of business since
it replaced the sucre as Ecuador's national currency.
</P>
<P>
   Dollar bills and bills of larger denominations were abundant.
But Ecuadoreans griped about the lack of coins for change and
complained that merchants were rounding off prices at the dollar
level -- a sore point in a poor country where more than two-thirds
of workers earn less than $30 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper vendors raised the price of papers from 20 cents to a
quarter on Monday but often did not have change if the buyer tried
to pay with a dollar bill.
</P>
<P>
   Shoeshine boys, who charged 4,000 sucres, the equivalent of 16
cents before the sucre went out of circulation at midnight
Saturday, were having problems attracting customers because they
couldn't make change.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to keep taking sucre coins. If I don't, I can't make
any sales,'' said Francisco Quijije, who sells fish stew for $1.60
a bowl from a street stall in Manta, a port city on Ecuador's
Pacific coast.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Bank reminded Ecuadoreans that sucres no longer have
value for commercial operations but said leftover sucres may still
be switched at special locations until March 9. The bank estimated
some $20 million in low denomination sucre bills and coins had not
yet been exchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador, wracked by political and economic disorder for years,
on Saturday completed a six-month transition to making the U.S.
dollar its currency. During the transition both dollars and sucres
circulated as legal tender, at an official exchange rate of 25,000
sucres to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador joins nine other countries or territories using the U.S.
dollar as their official currency, according to the International
Monetary Fund. They include Panama, Guam, the Marshall Islands,
Micronesia, Palau, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, the British Virgin
Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Officials hope the switchover will end record inflation running
at 104 percent a year, Latin America's highest. The step is
designed to prevent the government from printing excessive money to
meet its budgetary needs. Economists blame Ecuador's economic woes
on decades of deficit spending.
</P>
<P>
   So far, signs indicate the plan is working. Monthly inflation
has plunged from 14.3 percent in January to 1.4 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Central Bank began distributing coins freshly
minted in Canada and Mexico in amounts equivalent to the U.S.
penny, the nickel, the dime and the quarter. Ecuador has followed
Panama's example in using U.S. bills but minting its own coins.
</P>
<P>
   But the new coins, for the most part, are circulating only in
large cities.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller towns and villages have not yet received them and are
trying to make do with small supplies of U.S. coins, which are
legal tender along with the new coins.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their demise as official currency, sucre bills and coins
worth less than $1 were still circulating -- bills for 20,000
sucres, 10,000 sucres and 5,000 sucres and coins with denomination
of 1,000 sucres and 500 sucres.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're still taking sucres because we can't afford to lose a
sale in these difficult times. We're going to get together with
other merchants and exchange them at the Central Bank,'' said
Benigno Alcivar, owner of a vegetable stall in a street market in
Guayaquil, Ecuador's largest city.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Aguirre, an economist, criticized the government of
President Gustavo Noboa for not putting new coins into circulation
months ago to provide for enough time for them to reach small towns
and rural areas before the currency switch.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has been a lack of foresight by the government in not
providing coins in time and in sufficient amounts,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Haiti Police Chief Convicted  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- A jury on Monday convicted the
former police chief of Haiti's capital and three other officers of
rounding up 11 suspected gang members and executing them.
</P>
<P>
   The trial was seen as an advance in government efforts to rein
in rampant police violence. It was the first time members of
Haiti's new force, created five years ago with U.S. help, have
faced trial. Fears have grown the new force could turn out to be
like the trigger-happy one it replaced.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-member jury found former police chief Jean Coles Rameau,
31, and former officers Yvens Francois, 28, Laura Frito, 30, and
Lajeunesse Pierre-Kenel, 39, guilty. They were sentenced to three
years of hard labor, the minimum punishment. Two other officers
were acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   The killings occurred on May 28, 1999, as police were
investigating a shootout between rival gangs. At the time, police
said the gangsters started shooting at officers, who returned fire.
Rameau denied responsibility for the killings.
</P>
<P>
   However, a medical examiner's report showed the victims had been
shot in the front two to 12 times each at close range. Bullets from
Rameau's machine gun were found in several bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The killings ignited protests across Haiti and abroad. Rameau
fled to the neighboring Dominican Republic but was extradited after
the government issued arrest warrants for him and 19 other
officers.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen officers were arrested and seven remain fugitives. Of
those arrested, seven were released for lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of officers have been fired for crimes including drug
dealing and murder, but none has been tried. In 1999, police killed
66 people, twice the number as in 1998.

<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Tropical Storm Florence formed Monday southeast of
North Carolina and quickly gained strength as it drifted slowly to
the west with sustained winds of 70 mph.
</P>
<P>
   The system was not expected to pose a threat to the continental
United States through Thursday, according to the National Hurricane
Center in Miami. A hurricane forms when winds reach 75 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will produce some heavy surf and rip currents along the
southeast U.S. Coast and Bermuda,'' hurricane specialist Stacy
Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   At 11 p.m. EDT, the sixth named storm of the 2000 Atlantic
hurricane season was centered about 400 miles south-southeast of
Cape Hatteras, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The storm's movement was expected to be slow and erratic over
the next 24 hours.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Accepts Jewish Honor  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- On the eve of her first primary election,
Hillary Rodham Clinton collected a controversial award from the
World Jewish Congress for setting up a meeting between her husband
and the head of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons and others, including former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato,
were honored for work on restitution for Holocaust victims.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady received an award for arranging a meeting between
President Clinton and World Jewish Congress President Edgar
Bronfman. Some critics have questioned whether the award is
appropriate, given that Bronfman is an adviser to her campaign and
Jews make up a crucial voting bloc in the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   In accepting the award, the first lady described her role as ''a
very minor part'' of the effort, while the president thanked two
Republican honorees, including D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 people from the Jewish Human Rights Forum demonstrated
outside the Pierre Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's crass exploitation of the Holocaust for partisan
political purposes,'' said Beth Gilinsky, who heads the group.
''All she did was she told her husband he should meet with Edgar
Bronfman. There's nothing wrong with it, but it's nothing compared
to the years of effort put in by other people.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign of Clinton's opponent, Republican Rep. Rick Lazio,
has pointed out that he, too, played a role in restitution efforts
by introducing a bill that extended the life of a presidential
commission investigating what happened to assets of Holocaust
victims that came into American hands.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Hillary Clinton faces her first electoral challenge,
against relatively unknown orthopedic surgeon Mark McMahon. Both
Clintons planned to vote in Chappaqua, where they have a home.
</P>
<P>
   The primary is historically significant, the first time any U.S.
first lady's name has appeared on a ballot. Lazio does not face a
primary challenge.

<HEADLINE> GM Warns of Air Bag Problem  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. has warned owners of 290,000
Buick and Oldsmobile sedans that driver-side air bags could deploy
unexpectedly, but a recall will not begin until later this year
because GM does not have parts to fix the problem.
</P>
<P>
   GM spokesman Terry Rhadigan said 60 injuries, all minor, have
been reported from 115 incidents of air bag deployment in the
vehicles. The problem affects 103,000 1995 Buick Regals and 187,000
Oldsmobile Cutlass Supremes from 1995-96 sold in the United States
and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is caused by corrosion on a wire linked to the air
bag inflator. GM has to find a supply of new air bag inflators,
which will take a few months, Rhadigan said. GM hopes to start
repairing vehicles in December.

<HEADLINE> Hostage Takers Accused of Rape  </HEADLINE>
By SARAH EL DEEB
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) -- Four European hostages freed by rebels in
the Philippines reached the Libyan capital Monday, with one saying
they were powerless to prevent their captors from raping some of
the female hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Risto Vahanen of Finland was one of four former captives -- which
included a German, a Frenchman, and a second Finn -- who arrived in
Tripoli after Libya reportedly paid a $1 million each to free them.
</P>
<P>
   Vahanen, held for 140 days by the Abu Syyaf rebels, told Finnish
MTV3 that other hostages couldn't do anything to help the women
being abused by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some, a few, women there were treated in an inappropriate
manner,'' Vahanen said, and answered ''yes'' when asked if they had
been raped.
</P>
<P>
   He said the raped women did not want their names disclosed but
wanted the incidents made public ''so that the world would know
what Robot had done,'' Vahanen said, referring to rebel leader
Ghalib ''Robot'' Andang.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was quite surprising because otherwise we were treated in a
proper way,'' he said in the interview before leaving the
Philippines on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   His group of four were freed Saturday -- and they are nearly the
last of a group of 21 hostages kidnapped April 23 from a Malaysian
diving resort.
</P>
<P>
   One Filipino resort worker remains in captivity from the group
taken in April.
</P>
<P>
   Also still held by the Abu Sayyaf rebels are two French
journalists seized when they visited the rebels' camp.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas are also holding 12 Filipino Christian
evangelists and three Malaysian men kidnapped Sunday near the
Malaysian diving resort, where the hostage crisis began.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Tuesday that the Malaysian hostages had already
arrived in the southern Philippine province of Sulu. Earlier,
President Joseph Estrada had ordered the military to prevent their
arrival in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   After kidnapping the men, the rebels had fled with them in a
speedboat toward the Philippines, said Jose Calimlim, deputy chief
of staff of the military.
</P>
<P>
   Another faction is holding American Jeffrey Schilling.
</P>
<P>
   The Libyan official who negotiated the latest release, Rajab
Azzarouq, said he expects the two French journalists would be freed
''Friday or Saturday once the situation stabilizes so they
shouldn't be in danger'' -- an allusion to fighting among the Abu
Sayyaf factions reportedly over the division of the ransom money.
</P>
<P>
   But Azzarouq made clear that Libya would not try to negotiate
the release of Schilling, 24, of Oakland, Calif., who was captured
when he visited the rebels' camp.
</P>
<P>
   Azzarouq said the Philippines, not Libya, must deal with
Schilling's case. ''The American hostage is a willing hostage. He
went on his own there against the advice of his government not to
go to that place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Azzarouq, first to appear at the door of the aircraft which
brought the former hostages to Tripoli, paused and triumphantly
waved to dozens of well-wishers on the tarmac.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages followed, carrying bouquets of flowers, and they
praised Libya for securing their freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they have done a really great job,'' Vahanen said.
''It may be possible that they've saved our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Muslim Libya has long-standing ties with Muslim rebels in the
mostly Catholic Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Besides negotiating in previous kidnappings, it has helped build
schools and mosques in the south, But it has has been accused of
training members of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, the larger
Muslim rebel group, which like the smaller Abu Sayyaf claims it is
fighting to establish an Islamic homeland in the south.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the concerns that the ransoms would encourage demands
for bigger ransoms, Libya was reaping diplomatic rewards for its
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Finnish Foreign Minister Erkki Tuomioja headed to the north
African nation to participate in a welcome ceremony for the
hostages scheduled Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   France and Germany were sending lower-ranking officials from
their foreign ministries, though diplomats in Tripoli said German
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, in New York on Monday for U.N.
meetings, would try to reach Tripoli in time for Tuesday's
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   A similar ceremony held for six former hostages released last

<HEADLINE> NBC To Release Space Reality Series  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC is hoping for a ratings liftoff from
''Survivor'' mastermind Mark Burnett.
</P>
<P>
   The network has agreed to pay nearly $40 million for the rights
to Burnett's ''Destination Mir,'' a reality series that would
launch an everyday American into space for a rendezvous with the
Russian space station Mir, according to Tuesday's Daily Variety.
</P>
<P>
   The series would follow a group of would-be cosmonauts from
space camp to launch pad over 13 to 15 episodes, culminating with a
dramatic live broadcast in which a winner is picked and sent into
space.
</P>
<P>
   The $35 million-to-$40 million price tag includes the nearly $20
million Burnett will pay to MirCorp, a Russian company that has
leased the use of the space station from RSC Energia, the private
firm which now controls what was once the Soviet space program,
Daily Variety reports.
</P>
<P>
   NBC hasn't scheduled the series yet, Daily Variety said,
although it quoted the network's entertainment president Garth
Ancier as aiming for a fall 2001 premiere, with the actual launch
into space taking place by early 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The series would follow the contestants through space boot camp,
with one participant eliminated every week by Russian space
officials. The live, two-hour conclusion would gather several
finalists on a launch pad, where the winner would be announced and
then climb aboard a Soyuz space capsule for the 10-day round trip.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett, who cooked up the series, gave CBS sky-high ratings
this summer with his 13-episode ''Survivor,'' in which 16 volunteer
castaways were marooned on a tropical isle, where they competed on
camera for a $1 million prize.

<HEADLINE> Albright JoinS Fight Against AIDS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright joined
with 12 women foreign ministers Monday to ''lend momentum'' to a
worldwide campaign to stop the spread of HIV and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Albright presented staggering figures of the toll the disease
exacts worldwide: almost 3 million people die each year; each day,
more than 10,000 people are newly infected.
</P>
<P>
   And, Albright said, ''each time we look, more and more of the
victims are women.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Albright and other women foreign ministers tried to
highlight the trafficking in women. This year, at a reception at
the Pierpont Morgan Library sponsored by Marie Claire magazine, she
focused on HIV/AIDS, saying ''denial does not prevent disease, nor
care for it, for those affflicted.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite strong efforts, Albright said, ''we are not winning the
war against AIDS, we are losing it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has invested $225 million this year
to fight the disease and has proposed an increase of more than 50
percent in 2001, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But it will take more than money, she said, as the 13 foreign
ministers signed a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
urging every effort to make the fight against AIDS a permanent part
of the organization's agenda.

<HEADLINE> N.Korea Minister Cancels UN Visit  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- North Korea's foreign minister has canceled his
attendance at the U.N. General Assembly, which puts off expected
talks with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, the State
Department said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Department spokesman Richard Boucher said ''unavoidable
reasons'' prompted Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun's cancellation,
and it was not aimed at slowing an improving relationship with the
United States. ''We are still in touch with them on setting dates''
for a meeting on North Korea's sale of missiles, Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   The postponement will not have ''a negative effect'' on
improving relations with North Korea, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials also confirmed that North Korea has withdrawn its
objection to keeping 37,000 U.S. troops south of the 38th parallel
truce line, in place since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, told of the change in
policy by the communist North in a North-South summit conference
this summer, relayed the decision to American officials. He spoke
of it earlier in news interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Paek had planned to head North Korea's delegation to the special
session of the assembly and confer with Albright on the sidelines
about further reconciliation with both South Korea and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said there was no indication the decision was related to
the moves at reconciliation on the peninsula or to a recent dispute
that arose from U.S. airline officials' insistence on searching
North Korean diplomats in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean President Kim told American officials that North
Korea no longer objects to the continued presence of U.S. troops
because it realizes they prevent a political vacuum on the
peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   While North Korea has not informed the United States directly,
an official called the information from Kim ''good news'' and
another step in a progressively improving relationship with the
long-reclusive communist regime.
</P>
<P>
   Even with an improved relationship between the two Koreas, the
Clinton administration considers the troops in South Korea an
important stabilizing presence, said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The main U.S. goal is to persuade Kim Jong Il, the North Korean
leader, to halt the development and sale of missiles.
</P>
<P>
   After negotiations with the United States, a North Korean
nuclear program was frozen in exchange for supplies of energy and
civilian-style reactors.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are encouraged by some of the stops the North Koreans are
taking,'' Defense Secretary William Cohen said at a New York news
conference. ''But we are looking to see if they can be more deeply
ingrained.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration already rejected any idea of
withdrawing U.S. troops from the peninsula, where they have served
as a bulwark against a southward North Korean offensive for a
half-century.
</P>
<P>
   However, North Korea's understanding of their continued presence
reverses long-standing demands by Pyongyang that they get out.
</P>
<P>
   A thaw between the two Koreas began to take serious shape two
months ago when Kim Dae-jung went to Pyongyang for a summit meeting
with Kim Jong Il.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, North and South Korea agreed to march together behind
a unification flag at Friday's opening ceremonies of the 2000
Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia. Clinton administration
officials approve the reconciliation and has been stepping up U.S.
contacts with North Korea even as Kim Jong Il's government,
considered by the United States a supporter of terrorism, remained
ineligible for U.S. aid except for emergency food and other
humanitarian relief.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Albright expressed her regret over the forced
searches of North Korean delegation members en route to the U.N.
Millennium Summit and said they did not reflect U.S. policy.
</P>
<P>
   The searches, in Frankfurt, Germany, were part of a security
check as the delegation led by Kim Yong Nam, head of the communist
country's parliament, was being transferred to an American Airlines
flight for New York.

	   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) - USA Today has selected Xerox Corp. to
help publish a daily supplement on Olympic results at the Sydney,
Australia games, the company announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper and Xerox will work together to publish a daily,
four-page ''Sydney Extra'' for each copy of the newspaper sold in
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   The insert will contain up-to-date results of every Olympics
competition from the day before.
</P>
<P>
   Because the regular USA Today newspapers for the Australian
market are printed in Hong Kong - a 10-hour flight away - Olympics
results in the newspaper would be incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   However, using Xerox high-speed digital printing equipment, the
extra edition can be printed at midnight Sydney time, Xerox
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Each day's Olympics results, photographs and medal counts will
be compiled and produced by the USA Today staff. The finished pages
will be sent electronically to Corporate Documentation Management
Ltd., a commercial print shop, where up to 8,000 copies of the
11-by-17-inch supplement will be printed on Xerox DocuTech digital
printing systems.
</P>
<P>
   USA Today will then insert a finished Sydney Extra edition into
each regular newspaper and have the news package available to
readers by 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Sydney games run from Sept. 15 through Oct. 1.

First Lady Accepts Jewish Honor
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- On the eve of her first primary election, Hillary Rodham
Clinton collected a controversial award from the World Jewish Congress for
setting up a meeting between her husband and the head of the organization. The
Clintons and others, including former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, were honored for
work on restitution for Holocaust victims. The first lady received an award for
arranging a meeting between President Clinton and World Jewish Congress
President Edgar Bronfman. Some critics have questioned whether the award is
appropriate, given that Bronfman is an adviser to her campaign and Jews make up
a crucial voting bloc in the Senate race.

Ex-Haiti Police Chief Convicted in Killings
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- A jury on Monday convicted the former police
chief of Haiti's capital and three other officers of rounding up 11 suspected
gang members and executing them. The trial was seen as an advance in government
efforts to rein in rampant police violence. It was the first time members of
Haiti's new force, created five years ago with U.S. help, have faced trial.
Fears have grown the new force could turn out to be like the trigger-happy one
it replaced. The 12-member jury found former police chief Jean Coles Rameau, 31,
and former officers Yvens Francois, 28, Laura Frito, 30, and Lajeunesse
Pierre-Kenel, 39, guilty.

Iraq Getting More Food to Civilians

   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Iraq has considerably increased the amount of food
getting to ordinary people from the U.N. aid program but has refused to
cooperate with an investigation of the humanitarian situation in the country,
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Monday. In a report on the U.N. oil-for-food
program, Annan also pointed to the $1.5 billion worth of contracts that remain
held up in the U.N. committee that monitors sanctions against Iraq -- largely at
the request of the United States. The program lets Iraq sell its oil to buy
food, medicine and other goods for its people who have been under strict U.N.
sanctions since 1990.

Parker gave no reason for putting off a scheduled court hearing until Wednesday.
Under the deal described Sunday by government sources, Lee was expected to drop

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Foreign-born residents of the United States are about as

<HEADLINE> Clintons to vote in Chappaqua; president says handshake was OK  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. (AP) - President Clinton joined his wife on the
eve of her first primary election and weighed in on the controversy
over a photo showing her Senate opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio, shaking
hands with Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   The president said the handshake was no different from a kiss
Hillary Clinton gave Arafat's wife last fall - a kiss for which she
has been repeatedly criticized.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he did the right thing to speak to Mr. Arafat,''
Clinton told WNBC-TV on Monday after an appearance with his wife at
a Jewish community center in Westchester. ''Hillary was on a
diplomatic mission; she could not provoke an international incident
at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons planned to vote early Tuesday in Chappaqua, where
they have a home, in the Democratic primary election that marks the
first time any U.S. first lady's name has appeared on a ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton is being challenged by Dr. Mark McMahon, an
orthopedic surgeon. McMahon has boasted that he expects a primary
upset over the first lady, but polls show fewer than 15 percent of
New York Democratic voters support him.
</P>
<P>
   After voting, Hillary Clinton was scheduled to head to a diner
in her adopted hometown for a live-by-satellite appearance on ABC's
''Good Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio is being accused of hypocrisy by Clinton supporters for
having criticized the president for his handshake with Cuban
President Fidel Castro during last week's U.N. summit.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has also condemned Hillary Clinton for the kiss she gave
Soha Arafat last fall after Mrs. Arafat gave a speech accusing the
Israelis of using poison gas against Palestinian children.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't pick who you negotiate with ... but that doesn't
mean you have to be friends with, to embrace, them,'' Lazio told
the New York Post shortly after he entered the race in May.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said Sunday there was a ''big difference'' between his
handshake with Arafat in 1998 and what the Clintons did. He said
the delegation of which he was part was there to recognize the
repeal of a Palestinian charter provision that called for Israel's
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, the GOP candidate, does not face a primary challenge.

<HEADLINE> Party Leaders Win Parliament Seats  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- The leaders of Canada's two major right-wing
parties easily won seats in Parliament Monday in special elections
that set up a battle for conservative voters in next year's federal
balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Former Prime Minister Joe Clark won 54 percent of the vote in a
five-candidate race in Nova Scotia, Canada's eastern maritime
province.
</P>
<P>
   In British Columbia, meanwhile, Stockwell Day, 50, declared
victory in a race for a rural Parliamentary seat. With half the
votes counted, Day had 71 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Day, a fundamentalist Christian, heads the Canadian Alliance
party. He will become the official opposition leader in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, 61, retired from politics in 1993 but has returned to
lead the Conservative Party, which faces a strong challenge from
Day's Canadian Alliance for status as Canada's dominant right-wing
political party.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've been trying very consistently to throw us off
balance,'' Clark said. ''They realize that their time is running
out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance, a new party, recruited politicians and
behind-the-scenes organizers from the Conservative Party and
French-speaking separatist politicians.
</P>
<P>
   The right-wing battle and the looming national elections added a
decidedly non-local tone to campaigning leading to Monday's vote.
Day spoke of foreign policy and military commitments during his
acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a few more miles to go and more work to do,'' said
Day, referring to the coming national elections.

<HEADLINE> Key Votes Ahead on China Trade Bill  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supporters of major legislation to permanently
normalize trade with China girded for a key vote on linking trade
relations to China's obeying weapons proliferation agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., and Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., on
Monday proposed an amendment to the trade bill outlining sanctions
on foreign companies and nations that deal in weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said it was wrong to do away with U.S. trade leverage
over China when ''they are engaging in activities that post a
mortal danger to the welfare of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   His amendment is opposed by both the administration and Senate
backers of the trade bill, who argue that unilateral sanctions
don't work and that approval of any amendment could effectively
scuttle chances for passage this year.
</P>
<P>
   The House passed the trade bill by a 237-197 margin last May,
but it's unclear whether the House has the time or the votes to
approve any Senate changes before Congress adjourns next month.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., a leading supporter of permanent
normal trade relations, said approval of the Thompson amendment
would be a ''grave mistake'' for the nation. ''It will seriously
damage important American economic interests and if added to the
bill, it will kill PNTR.''
</P>
<P>
   No time had been set for a vote on the amendment. On Tuesday the
Senate, which last week defeated several attempts to change the
bill, votes on an amendment offered by Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.,
requiring China to disclose how it is meeting its commitment to the
World Trade Organization to end subsidies to state enterprises that
export goods.
</P>
<P>
   China is making final preparations to join the WTO and failure
of Congress to grant permanent trade status would deprive American
businesses of the lower tariffs China has agreed to as part of its
WTO accession.
</P>
<P>
   Business groups that avidly support the trade bill say it will
significantly increase U.S. exports to China, which now enjoys a
trade surplus of near $70 billion a year. The bill is opposed by
labor groups and groups critical of China's human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said he supported the trade bill but ''it is
inconceivable to me that while we discuss trade issues and a new
relationship with China we will not address what China is doing to
endanger our country.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted a recent CIA report citing China, Russia and North
Korea as the key suppliers of nuclear, chemical and biological
weapons technology, and reports the Chinese were helping Pakistan,
Libya and Iran with their weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Thompson-Torricelli amendment would set up an annual review
of the weapons sales of China, Russia and North Korea and require
the president to impose non-trade-related sanctions on individuals
and companies that violate nonproliferation agreements. The
president could also impose additional sanctions on key supplier
nations.
</P>
<P>
   It also requires the Securities and Exchange Commission to
create a procedure to inform American investors when foreign
entities on the president's proliferation list invest in U.S.
capital markets.
</P>
<P>
   The president would be able to waive the sanctions requirements
for national security reasons, but Congress could vote to override
that waiver.

   In addition to the Thompson amendment, the Senate must still
vote on other amendments proposed by Sens. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and
Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., dealing with such issues as China's human
rights, labor, prison labor and abortion policies. Supporters hope
to get to a final vote by the end of the week.

<HEADLINE> Forecasts Fill Old Farmer's Almanac  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID TIRRELL-WYSOCKI
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, N.H. (AP) -- How do you change your pants in the woods?
Why are foul-ups on your IBM called ''computer bugs?'' Oh, and
what's the weather going to be?
</P>
<P>
   Mixed between astronomical charts and farmer's calendars are the
answers, or possible answers, in the 209th edition of the Old
Farmer's Almanac. It hits newsstands Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Like the newer Farmer's Almanac published in Maine, the 2001
edition of the Old Farmer's Almanac predicts more snow than normal
this winter from New England all the way to Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   Of more concern than the snow is the possibility of another
significant summer drought from the desert Southwest across Texas,
Oklahoma, parts of the deep South and the Great Plains.
</P>
<P>
   America's oldest continuously published periodical boasts an 80
percent accuracy rate, ''never 81 and never 79,'' Editor Jud Hale
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are definitely consistently doing better than if you were
guessing,'' he said. ''And we are consistently doing better than if
you were doing weather averages.''
</P>
<P>
   Hale wishes they had done better predicting this year's cool and
wet summer in New England. He said he has taken a lot of heat from
nonplussed neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we'd missed it in South Dakota it wouldn't have mattered so
much,'' he said. ''I wouldn't have gotten so much ribbing.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with some misses, people still call for help planning
things such as outdoor weddings.
</P>
<P>
   ''They often say something like, 'August 21st, we're outside
Oklahoma City and we're wondering whether to rent a tent or not. Is
it going to rain that day?''' Hale said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll say whatever it is, 'It's going to be hot and clear, but
why don't you rent a tent?'''
</P>
<P>
   Hale's favorite article in this year's edition tells how to
change your pants in the woods without getting your socks or feet
wet. The key is always having at least one shoe on, and having one
leg of each pair on at one time. Details on page 251.
</P>
<P>
   According to another item, Grace Hopper, who helped program the
first large-scale digital computer in the country, coined the
phrase ''computer bug'' in 1951 to describe computer problems when
a moth shorted out two tubes in an experimental computer she was
working on.
</P>
<P>
   And in its ''Tastes and Trends'' section, the latest almanac
predicts pantsuits will be back for women, the mustache will be
back for men and women will be wearing pajama bottoms -- in public.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Increases Repression  </HEADLINE>
By JOVANA GEC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Aca Radic thought putting up
campaign posters was a normal part of any election race.
</P>
<P>
   But after she did so, the 23-year-old activist says, drunken
local police detained her and six other members of a student group
opposed to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. She says the
officers beat them and hung them upside down by their feet.
</P>
<P>
   ''They tied a rope around my neck and squeezed until I was out
of breath,'' Radic told The Associated Press. ''They threatened to
kill us and dump our bodies on the border with Kosovo to make it
seem as if Kosovo Albanians did it.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident is part of a marked increase in government
repression against the opposition, just weeks before Yugoslavs go
to the polls on Sept. 24 to elect their president, parliament and
local authorities.
</P>
<P>
   With Milosevic trailing in opinion polls, his autocratic
government has unleashed an unprecedented campaign against
opponents, creating a climate of fear ahead of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Just days before the alleged police attack on Radic in the
southern Serb town of Vladicin Han, authorities in Belgrade
ransacked the main office of the student-run group Otpor, which
means resistance in Serbian. Activists were arrested as they
prepared to meet with the foreign minister of Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Police also raided the offices of an independent election
monitoring group, seizing computers. Dozens of opposition activists
have been detained. Some have been beaten.
</P>
<P>
   ''The political scene here resembles a training ground with
accelerated preparations for a war,'' said Ivan Torov, an analyst
from the independent daily Danas. ''Never has an election campaign
here been so dirty and unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   Polite competition has never been a common feature of any
election in Yugoslavia in the past decade. Milosevic's government
is believed to have rigged as many as five elections in Yugoslavia
and its dominant republic, Serbia, in the past and has never
allowed a free and open campaign in the state-run media.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, the stakes are higher for Milosevic, who was
indicted last year for alleged war crimes in Kosovo. If he were to
lose, he would be vulnerable for extradition to the U.N. war crimes
tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ruling coalition considers the September elections a
matter of life and death, survival in power or disappearance,''
said Torov, who believes the government has activated its machinery
of repression to frighten Serbs into voting for Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe Milosevic set the tone for the election
campaign when he declared in a speech earlier this year that the
Serbs had no opposition figures -- just a handful of traitors and
foreign mercenaries. Since then, Milosevic's lieutenants have
branded all their opponents as terrorists, fascists or NATO
lackeys.
</P>
<P>
   Even Yugoslavia's top generals are popping up with increasing
regularity on state-run television, warning of outside plots.
</P>
<P>
   So far, opposition politicians have had little or no chance to
respond to Milosevic's accusations: They are almost completely
banned from the predominant state-run media. Nonetheless, the head
of the opposition election team, Zoran Djindjic, believes its
candidates have the winning strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our campaign is positive,'' he said. ''We are trying to stir
positive energy in Serbia because we can win only if people manage
to overcome their fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Student leader Radic agreed, suggesting that the police action
only strengthened Otpor's resolve to push Milosevic out.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not afraid,'' Radic said. ''If we stop because of what
happened, then (police) would do it in the whole of Serbia.''

<HEADLINE> Poland Disco Rekindles Rancor  </HEADLINE>
By BEATA PASEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSWIECIM, Poland (AP) -- A scantily clad girl gyrates to techno
music atop a podium as bartenders in white shirts and bow ties
serve up drinks. Nothing special as discos go, except this one has
sparked a furor because of its location: a former tannery where
Auschwitz concentration camp inmates worked and died.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish leaders and the Polish government have voiced outrage
that officials in Oswiecim -- the Polish name for Auschwitz -- issued
a permit for the System dance club last month.
</P>
<P>
   The disco is a little over a mile from the Auschwitz camp site,
which is now a museum, but the distance doesn't diminish Jewish
sensitivities.
</P>
<P>
   ''The place has a tragic direct connection with the camp,'' said
Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the Los Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal
Center. Cooper was in Oswiecim this week for the formal reopening
of a 100-year-old synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that a fundamental error of judgment was made,'' he
told city officials at a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Locals in this southern Polish city of 50,000 people don't deny
the horrors of the Holocaust, but many bristle at suggestions they
are insensitive about it.
</P>
<P>
   ''People think about Oswiecim as one large cemetery,'' said
Rafal Waliczek, 30, the disco's owner. ''It's not true. There are
many young people here who want to have fun. And that's the best
place for it: a large building with space for parking.''
</P>
<P>
   The disco uproar is just the latest controversy over development
near the Auschwitz-Birkenau complex, where 1.5 million prisoners,
mostly Jews, were killed in gas chambers or died of disease and
starvation.
</P>
<P>
   Another dispute is simmering over plans for a commercial
visitors' center. Relations between Israel and Poland, which is 95
percent Roman Catholic, also have been strained by the erection of
Christian crosses on property adjoining the death camp.
</P>
<P>
   Historians say many of about 1,000 Auschwitz inmates forced to
work in the tannery died there. It also was used to store hair and
property from gas-chamber victims.
</P>
<P>
   But Waliczek says the original building was destroyed after the
war, and the factory-like structure housing his disco was built in
1952.
</P>
<P>
   City officials also note that the disco is on private property
about 800 yards beyond a 100-yard-deep commercial-free zone around
the memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Disco patrons who know of the tannery's grisly past say they do
not believe they are dishonoring Holocaust victims.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes, that was terrible, awful, but that was a long time ago,''
said Paulina Adamska, a 23-year-old student at Hunter College in
New York, who was at the disco Sunday to meet old high-school
friends during a visit home.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must cultivate the memory of the victims, but there are
special places for that,'' she said, sipping a beer at the bar.
''Oswiecim cannot become like a large cemetery because then all the
young people will leave.''
</P>
<P>
   She said System is Oswiecim's only disco, ''the only place in
this town where young people can meet and dance and have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   After a previous investor failed to win approval for a disco at
the old tannery, Waliczek received permission under a 1989 city
development plan that was amended in the mid-1990s to allow
restaurant and entertainment activities at the site.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything was in accordance with law,'' Waliczek said. ''And
it's outside the (protection) zone. Otherwise, what's the zone
for?''
</P>
<P>
   Oswiecim's vice mayor, Wlodzimierz Paluch, says the city is
working on a new development plan but that it won't be ready before
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the city is struggling to cope with post-communist
market reforms that have devastated old, inefficient local
industries. The largest employer, a chemical plant, had to cut its
work force from 12,000 to 2,000 several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The estimated 500,000 people a year who visit the Auschwitz
memorial might provide a needed economic boost, but there are no
hotels or restaurants to accommodate them. Some locals worry that
controversy surrounding the site might scare off big investors.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is less and less work here,'' said Jerzy Januszczyk, a
taxi driver who says he gets only two fares a day compared with
about 10 just a few years ago. ''We need a big investor, but
everybody is afraid about that silence zone. What if they make it
wider and tell the businesses to get out?''

<HEADLINE> Democrats Smell a 'Rat' in GOP Ad  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The GOP ad decries bureaucrats but Democrats
see something more subtle: rats.
</P>
<P>
   In a Republican National Committee ad that has aired in several
key states, the word ''rats'' appears on screen for a fleeting
moment before the full word ''bureaucrats'' appears.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential
candidate, made the point clear by giving a copy of a slowed-down
version of the 30-second ad to The New York Times, which reported
on it in Tuesday editions of the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides told the Times that a Democrat in Seattle had spotted
the ad's seemingly subliminal message and contacted county
Democrats, who then alerted the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign officials did not return telephone messages left
by The Associated Press on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The ad touts Republican George W. Bush's plan for adding
prescription drugs to Medicare, arguing that seniors will have more
control over their health care under Bush's proposal. Under the
Gore plan, the ad says, the program will be run by bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   Words flash on the screen to echo the announcer's message: ''The
Gore prescription plan: Bureaucrats decide.''
</P>
<P>
   As the announcer says ''Bureaucrats decide,'' the word ''rats,''
in large capital letters, flashes on and off the screen just as the
phrase ''Bureaucrats decide,'' appears.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say they were not trying to send any subliminal
messages.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a silly charge to try and get an effective ad off the
air,'' said Alex Castellanos, who made the ad for the RNC.
</P>
<P>
   He said he faded the word in so it would look more visually
interesting, and that it was just a coincidence that the letters
appearing first spell the name of a rodent.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a visual drum beat,'' he said. ''People get bored
watching TV. You're trying to get them interested and involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are trying to make a case out of nothing, said Terry
Holt, spokesman for Victory 2000, which represents the Bush
campaign at the RNC.
</P>
<P>
   ''The word bureaucrats ends with 'rats' just like the word
Democrat,'' he said. ''It is a spot about health care. It's not a
spot about rodents.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign was equally dismissive.
</P>
<P>
   ''It sounds like happy hour at the Gore campaign lasted a little
too long,'' said Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer. And, referring
decades-old buzz about a Beatles song, he added: ''If you play the
ad backwards, you hear the words 'Paul is dead.'''
</P>
<P>
   Even if it was intentional, it isn't necessarily effective, said
Bill Benoit, who studies political advertising at the University of
Missouri. There's been only limited research on ''subliminal
perception,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no conclusive evidence that it works,'' he said. ''Of
course, that doesn't stop advertisers.''
</P>
<P>
   If use of the word ''rats'' was intentional, Benoit said it
might be inappropriate or questionable, though not necessarily
unethical.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he cautioned: ''It's awfully hard to tell whether it's
intentional or not.''

<HEADLINE> New York voters to decide primary races  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - New York voters headed for the polling booths
Tuesday to decide a batch of primary contests, among them Hillary
Rodham Clinton's U.S. Senate bout against an obscure Manhattan
doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Primary polls were to be open from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. in New York
City, on Long Island and in Westchester, Rockland, Orange and Erie
counties. The polls were to be open from noon to 9 p.m. in the rest
of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton faces Dr. Mark McMahon, an orthopedic surgeon.
Republican U.S. Senate candidate Rep. Rick Lazio has no primary
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   McMahon based his campaign on the first lady's lack of New York
roots. He is not considered a threat, but support for McMahon could
demonstrate Democratic dissatisfaction with Clinton's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   There are also U.S. Senate primaries for the Independence, Right
to Life and Green parties.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most competitive races are for seats in the House
and state Legislature, where several serious challengers are
forcing incumbents to work to keep their jobs. Democratic
incumbents in the state Assembly and Senate faced primary
challenges Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the state legislative veterans facing tough intra-party
challenges are Democratic Assemblymen Clarence Norman, Darryl Towns
and Roger Green, from Brooklyn, and Assemblyman Arthur Eve, of
Buffalo. Eve is the longest-serving member of the state Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 26 Democratic incumbents in the state Assembly and
Senate faced primary challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Among House incumbents, eight Democrats and two Republicans
faced primary challenges.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bronx, Rep. Eliot Engel is in a bitter battle with state
Sen. Larry Seabrook. In Brooklyn, Rep. Edolphus Towns faces lawyer
Barry Ford, Rep. Major Owens is up against City Councilwoman Una
Clarke, and freshman Rep. Anthony Weiner is in a rematch with City
Councilman Noach Dear.
</P>
<P>
   There also is a battle for Lazio's open seat in Suffolk County.
Lazio and the Republican Party are backing Islip Town Clerk Joan
Johnson, who would be the first black female Republican in the
House. On the Democratic side, Huntington town board member Steve
Israel is running against Suffolk County legislator David Bishop.
</P>
<P>
   On the eastern tip of Long Island, Rep. Michael Forbes will face
his first test at the polls since swapping parties last year to
become a Democrat after complaining about the extremism of GOP
leaders in the House. Challenging him is Regina Seltzer, a
71-year-old former librarian and Brookhaven town councilwoman.

<HEADLINE> Netherlands To Vote on Gay Marriage  </HEADLINE>
By ANTHONY DEUTSCH
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- The Netherlands, long among the
gay rights vanguard, was set to take another step Tuesday: Pending
legislation would convert the country's current ''registered
same-sex partnerships'' into marriages, complete with divorce
guidelines and wider adoption rights for gays.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say the bill would give Dutch gays rights beyond
those offered in any other country.
</P>
<P>
   And the bill was virtually assured of passing during a vote set
for Tuesday. An overwhelming majority in the 150-seat parliament
favors the government's proposal. Only a few small Christian
parties opposed the bill in an emotional and often heated three-day
debate last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''The law acknowledges that a person's sex is not of importance
for marriage,'' said Boris Dittrich, a member of the centrist
Democrats 66 party and a proponent of the plan. He spoke during
what he called ''the most moving debate'' of his parliamentary
career.
</P>
<P>
   In Norway and Sweden, gay couples can already register their
partnerships and Denmark has gone a step further -- it was the first
country in the world to allow gay marriages in 1989. Two years ago,
the Netherlands enacted a law allowing same-sex couples to register
as partners and to claim pensions, social security and inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   But the new Dutch legislation goes farther, creating full
equality for gays, activists said.
</P>
<P>
   Same-sex couples will be able to marry at city hall and adopt
Dutch children. They will be able to divorce through the court
system, like heterosexual couples.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will be able to call it what it is and that's marriage,''
said Henk Krol, an activist and editor-in-chief of the Gay Krant
magazine. He said the vote ''will be an absolute first in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   The law is expected to take effect early next year. Krol said he
plans to convert his own partnership status to marriage as soon as
it does.
</P>
<P>
   Displaying unusual solidarity, all three parliamentary factions
in the governing coalition -- the left-of-center Labor Party, the
Liberal VVD and the smaller Democrats 66 -- have pledged to back the
proposal. Even a few members of the biggest opposition party, the
largely traditional Christian Democratic Alliance, or CDA, have
expressed support.
</P>
<P>
   The plan hasn't been recognized by the dominant Protestant or
Roman Catholic churches, but a few breakaway churches have sent
encouraging letters to legislators.
</P>
<P>
   The Remonstrant Brethren, which broke from the Protestant church
in 1619, was one step ahead of the Dutch parliament, having
accepted gay marriages in 1986. The Remonstrants and a group called
the Old Catholic Church are the best-known supporters of gay rights
here.
</P>
<P>
   While gays will enjoy new liberties in the Netherlands, they may
run into trouble when they travel in countries where homosexuality
remains illegal. The Foreign Affairs Ministry has proposed offering
legal assistance to Dutch citizens in such cases.
</P>
<P>
   Some opponents fear the unique position of gays could isolate
the Dutch and set the Netherlands apart.
</P>
<P>
   The bill will create ''a world without foundations ... where the
historical understanding of marriage is torn from its roots,'' said
Kees van der Straaij of the Reformed Political Party.

<HEADLINE> Study: LAPD Needs Special Prosecutor  </HEADLINE>
By LEON DROUIN KEITH
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Police Department needs more
aggressive independent review and a permanent special prosecutor to
investigate misconduct, according to a report released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In the 150-page study commissioned by the police union, law
professor Erwin Chemerinsky of the University of Southern
California said the LAPD fosters an environment where excessive
force and a code of silence are tolerated and corruption can
fester.
</P>
<P>
   ''When innocent people are convicted, all of the institutions
have failed us and all must be reformed so this doesn't happen
again,'' said Chemerinsky, who was not paid for his examination of
the department.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Police Protective League, which represents 9,300
rank-and-file officers, had asked Chemerinsky to review an internal
Board of Inquiry report into the department's ongoing corruption
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 convictions have been overturned on charges that
anti-gang officers lied under oath, planted evidence, wrote false
reports and in some cases shot unarmed suspects.
</P>
<P>
   The board report, released in March, recommended curtailing
corruption by adopting several measures, including the expansion of
the LAPD's internal affairs division. Ultimately, however, the
board's report blamed ethics stains on officers and supervisors for
failing to carry out existing department policies.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Chemerinsky concluded that the department
downplayed the scandal and failed to acknowledge how its culture
perpetuated such lapses. He also noted that the Los Angeles
criminal justice system, including the county district attorney's
office, shares some blame for not catching discrepancies in
officers' cases.
</P>
<P>
   He called for a stronger civilian Police Commission and a system
in which people can more easily complain about alleged police
misconduct. The current Police Commission is appointed by the
mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't investigate my friends, you can't investigate your
friends, and you certainly can't investigate yourself,'' said
Connie Rice, a civil rights attorney who assisted in Chemerinsky's
review.
</P>
<P>
   The review proposes the civilian appointments to a police
oversight commission be made, not just by the mayor, but by
different city council members.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan had not read the report and had no
specific response to the suggestion of a more aggressive civilian
review process, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mayor insists on reform, so that anything that is
reasonable that relates to reform the mayor wants to seriously take
a look at,'' said Peter Hidalgo, Riordan's press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Bernard Parks has defended the department's
handling of the scandal, saying officers brought it to light and
have aggressively investigated the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   In comments made to the Los Angeles Times, Parks and the mayor
both criticized the union and the law professor. ''Mr. Chemerinsky
and the union are in bed together,'' Parks told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   In a related development, the Times reported Tuesday that the
Justice Department has decided to sue the city if local officials
don't consent to a binding agreement enforcing a package of police
reforms negotiated by federal and local officials. The City Council
is to review the reform package Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> 4 Dead in Japan Amid Heavy Rains  </HEADLINE>
By JOJI SAKURAI
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Boulevards became muddy rivers and hundreds of
thousands of people were ordered to evacuate Tuesday as torrential
rain soaked central Japan, killing at least four people and
injuring 29.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in Nagoya told more than 360,000 people to evacuate
their homes, said city official Tadanobu Horiguchi. Many sought
shelter on the second or third floors of schools, the prime
minister's office said.
</P>
<P>
   The dead included a 53-year-old firefighter who fell into a
flooded roadside ditch and a 49-year-old man who was buried in a
mudslide, Horiguchi said. Two other people were killed, 29 were
injured and four were missing, the national Police Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Television footage showed residents wading waist-deep in muddy
water and children navigating flooded streets in rubber
inner-tubes. Eight homes were demolished by landslides and nearly
3,000 were flooded above the floor level, national police said.
</P>
<P>
   Nagoya, a major industrial city of 2.2 million people, is about
165 miles west of Tokyo. Rainfall totaling 23 inches was recorded
in Tokai, near Nagoya, over the past 24-hour period, the local
observatory said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This flooding is unprecedented in our city,'' Horiguchi said.
''I've never seen such huge rainfalls in such a short period of
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Power outages interrupted bullet train service to the region,
the Prime Minister's Office said. About 50,000 passengers were
forced to sleep overnight in stalled trains, national broadcaster
NHK reported. Flooding made it impossible to bring them food.
</P>
<P>
   Major highways in central Japan were also closed to traffic, NHK
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The governor of Aichi state, where Nagoya is located, requested
disaster relief from the national government, the prime minister's
office said.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere Tuesday, a tornado swept through residential Tokyo,
destroying the roofs of several homes, a Tokyo police official said
on condition of anonymity. There were no reports of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   More violent weather was creeping toward Japan, as typhoon
Saomai approached the southernmost prefecture of Okinawa with
100-mph winds. The storm was about 60 miles east of the Okinawa
capital of Naha early Tuesday and was already lashing the island
with powerful winds.
</P>
<P>
   Naha is about 1,000 miles southwest of Tokyo.

<HEADLINE> Animal Control Officers Fined  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE (AP) -- Two Singapore animal control officers were
fined $4,000 each for fatally shooting a man while aiming at stray
dogs, an official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Heng Bak Tong, 56, and Loh Kar Seng, 43, were found guilty
Monday of negligence in the bystander's death, said Goh Shih Young,
a spokesman for Singapore's Agri-food and Veterinary Authority.
</P>
<P>
   The two were firing at a pack of stray dogs under a freeway
overpass in the island city-state on Nov. 2, 1998. Unemployed man
Lim Cheng Choon, 59, was hit as he fed the dogs.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 shotgun pellets were found in Lim's head and face,
Goh said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We deeply regret the accident,'' the AVA said in a statement.
''Since the accident, AVA has suspended the shooting of stray
dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Stray dogs are now caught using lassos, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Entertainment Execs Deny FTC Report  </HEADLINE>
By GARY GENTILE
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- As a parent, Kevin Foxe understands the
concern over marketing violent films to children.
</P>
<P>
   But as a filmmaker, he knows how important it is to have a
trailer for a new film screened right before the audience settles
down for a blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm actually surprised to see some of the trailers I see with
certain movies,'' Foxe, an executive producer of ''The Blair Witch
Project,'' said Monday. ''I'm sitting in the audience and I say,
'Why am I sitting with my kid watching a trailer for 'The Cell?'
</P>
<P>
   ''Yet if I'm making a movie, I'd love to have my trailer in
front of the No. 1 box office movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Movie trailers were just one target of a Federal Trade
Commission report issued Monday accusing the entertainment industry
of marketing violent songs, films and games to children.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC not only criticized the movie industry for showing
coming attractions for violent films to young audiences but also
for allowing underage patrons to buy tickets to R-rated films.
</P>
<P>
   The report, the result of a yearlong study, concluded that
movies rated R -- which require an adult to accompany children under
17 to the theater -- and video games that carry an M rating for 17
and over are routinely targeted toward younger people.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC did not single out specific film studios, record labels
or video game makers for criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials rebutted the allegations, which will be the
subject of a Senate Commerce Committee hearing on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe we are marketing our material appropriately, but we
are reviewing our marketing practices to ensure this is the case,''
said Ken Green, a spokesman for the Walt Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no enterprise in America that is more attentive to
the parents of this country than the movie industry,'' added Jack
Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of America.
''Instead of bludgeoning us, I think Congress should say
congratulations to the movie industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the music and video game industries issued
similar statements.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC, hoping to avoid a First Amendment legal battle, is not
pressing for legislation regulating the entertainment industry, but
is calling instead for an expansion of voluntary codes.
</P>
<P>
   One theme struck by entertainment executives Monday was the
unfairness of painting the industry with a broad brush. Independent
filmmakers, for instance, said that while they produce many films
with violent and sexually oriented content, their small budgets
prevent them from doing the kind of blanket marketing that could
result in inappropriate advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ''A movie in wide release has millions of dollars behind it and
the concept of targeting flies out the window,'' said Mark Urman,
co-president of Lions Gate Films, which released the blood-soaked
''American Psycho'' this year. ''You're going to touch and reach
everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the independent arena we're forced and very careful to aim
our marketing where it should be going. I don't think we can be
accused of creating appetites that couldn't or shouldn't be
satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   And executives were unanimous in rejecting any suggestion that
the government should regulate movie marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our members have the right to express themselves and to tell a
story the way they see it as artists,'' said Cheryl Rhoden,
assistant executive director of the Writer's Guild of America.
''The audience can accept or reject that, but government or other
entities have no right to suppress that expression. They can
criticize it and that's certainly fair. But they don't have a right
to attempt to block its distribution.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the movie studios will be represented at Wednesday's
hearing. Stacey Snider, chairwoman of the motion pictures group at
Universal Pictures, withdrew her name after learning she was the
lone studio representative to accept the committee's invitation to
testify.
</P>
<P>
   ''She has declined to participate ... because it would be
inappropriate for her to be the only studio head speaking for the
motion picture industry,'' said a studio spokeswoman.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - A 46-year-old inmate died at Strong
Memorial Hospital after being transported from the Monroe
Correctional Facility.
</P>
<P>
   Candy Brown died Sunday, but the cause of her death has not yet
been released and is pending the completion of an investigation by
the Monroe County Medical Examiner's office, according to Monroe
County sheriff's spokesman Jim Pringle.
</P>
<P>
   Pringle said Brown was arrested Friday on a parole violation. He
did not know the charge on which she had been convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after she was booked, deputies noticed she appeared ill
and put her in a cell equipped for medical observation.
</P>
<P>
   Pringle would not disclose the nature of Brown's illness.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, Brown's condition worsened and she was
transported to the hospital, Pringle said.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff's office and the state Department of Correction will
investigate the incident, as is the practice for all inmate deaths,
Pringle said.

Key Votes Ahead on China Trade Bill
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supporters of major legislation to permanently normalize
trade with China girded for a key vote on linking trade relations to China's
obeying weapons proliferation agreements. Sens. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., and
Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., on Monday proposed an amendment to the trade bill
outlining sanctions on foreign companies and nations that deal in weapons of
mass destruction. Thompson said it was wrong to do away with U.S. trade leverage
over China when ''they are engaging in activities that post a mortal danger to
the welfare of this country.''

Netherlands To Vote on Gay Marriage

   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- The Netherlands, long among the gay rights
vanguard, was set to take another step Tuesday: Pending legislation would
convert the country's current ''registered same-sex partnerships'' into
marriages, complete with divorce guidelines and wider adoption rights for gays.
Proponents say the bill would give Dutch gays rights beyond those offered in any
other country. And the bill was virtually assured of passing during a vote set
for Tuesday. An overwhelming majority in the 150-seat parliament favors the
government's proposal.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- On the eve of her first primary election, Hillary Rodham
Clinton collected a controversial award from the World Jewish Congress for
setting up a meeting between her husband and the head of the organization. The
Clintons and others, including former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, were honored for
work on restitution for Holocaust victims. The first lady received an award for
arranging a meeting between President Clinton and World Jewish Congress
President Edgar Bronfman. Some critics have questioned whether the award is
appropriate, given that Bronfman is an adviser to her campaign and Jews make up
a crucial voting bloc in the Senate race.

Ex-Haiti Police Chief Convicted in Killings

<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- A jury on Monday convicted the former police
chief of Haiti's capital and three other officers of rounding up 11 suspected
gang members and executing them. The trial was seen as an advance in government
efforts to rein in rampant police violence. It was the first time members of
Haiti's new force, created five years ago with U.S. help, have faced trial.
Fears have grown the new force could turn out to be like the trigger-happy one
it replaced. The 12-member jury found former police chief Jean Coles Rameau, 31,
and former officers Yvens Francois, 28, Laura Frito, 30, and Lajeunesse
Pierre-Kenel, 39, guilty.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Con Wins $60M in Texas Lottery  </HEADLINE>
By CONNIE MABIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Years ago, John Osorio spent time behind
bars after embezzling hundreds of thousands of dollars from an
insurance company's pension fund.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's a multimillionaire, having won a statewide lottery.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Osorio and a friend proudly but quietly displayed the
$60 million winning ticket at Texas Lottery Commission headquarters
before being whisked away by officials, who must validate the
ticket before declaring it an official winner.
</P>
<P>
   The jackpot was the third-largest in state history and the
largest won by a single ticket. Because the pair chose the cash
option, the prize is estimated at $21 million after taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ''There it is,'' a smiling Osorio whispered as he showed the
Lotto Texas ticket to a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ''We usually play Quick Pick,'' friend Lois Loden said as she
sat in the prize claim waiting room. ''I told John that if we were
ever going to win we were going to have to pick the numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Those digits: 1, 16, 36, 43, 44 and 52 were picked in Saturday
night's drawing. The numbers were a combination of anniversaries
and birthdays.
</P>
<P>
   But Osorio, 78, wasn't always so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, he was convicted of embezzling $641,250 from an
insurance company's pension fund and sentenced to three years in
federal prison. He served 14 months. He had been the state's
insurance commissioner from 1955 until 1957.
</P>
<P>
   Houston developer Frank Sharp and former Texas Attorney General
Waggoner Carr also were charged in the scandal that resulted in new
state political leadership and legislation that reformed campaign
finance reporting as well as open records and open meetings laws.
</P>
<P>
   Osorio's friends and neighbors were happy for his latest brush
with publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Winning ''couldn't happen to a more deserving guy,'' said friend
Hector DeLeon. ''He's had some tough times in his life and he's
always handled himself with grace, with style. He's always been a
gentleman.''

<HEADLINE> NKorea Envoy Visits Southern Island  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- A special North Korean emissary paid a
visit Tuesday to an exotic resort island in South Korea -- a
possible site for a visit to the South by the leader of his
communist country.
</P>
<P>
   After a night in Seoul, Kim Yong Sun flew to Cheju island off
the southern tip of the Korean Peninsula aboard a South Korean
military plane. He was greeted at the airport by the island's
governor, Woo Kun-min.
</P>
<P>
   After a 30-minute car ride from Cheju airport, Kim Yong Sun was
booked into a five-star hotel overlooking the East China Sea, a
venue for South Korea's summits with the United States, Russia,
China and Japan in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Lim Dong-won, head of South Korea's main government spy agency,
accompanied Kim Yong Sun on the trip. The two acted as the sides'
main coordinators for the first-ever inter-Korea summit in June.
</P>
<P>
   The North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, plans to make a return
visit to Seoul following his June summit with the South Korean
president in the North's capital, Pyongyang. Kim Jong Il reportedly
is interested in visiting Cheju during his trip to South Korea.
Seoul officials expect Kim's return visit to be made by spring at
the latest.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Jong Il's visit to the South would mark another milestone in
thawing relations between the two Korean states, which were divided
into the communist North and the pro-Western South in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   The Koreas fought a three-year war in the early 1950s and have
never signed a peace treaty. Their border is the world's most
heavily fortified, with nearly 2 million troops deployed on both
sides.
</P>
<P>
   But the sides have warmed dramatically since the June summit. At
that meeting, their leaders pledged to put the past behind them and
work together for peace.
</P>
<P>
   The Koreas have since stopped propaganda broadcasts against each
other and reopened border liaison offices. They allowed 200 people
to cross the border in August for temporary family reunions. Two
more reunions are scheduled before the year's end.
</P>
<P>
   In early September, South Korea repatriated 63 convicted North
Korean spies and guerrillas. The Koreas also have agreed to
reconnect a cross-border railway and let their athletes march
together behind a unification flag during opening ceremonies at the
Sydney Olympics -- the first time they have ever done so for the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Yong Sun is one of the most trusted aides to the North
Korean leader. He was the only North Korean official who sat in on
the June summit. He also heads the Asia-Pacific Peace Committee, a
semiofficial organization that handles the North's policy with
South Korea and other countries.
</P>
<P>
   After a one-day stay on the subtropical island, the North Korean
emissary was scheduled to fly back to mainland South Korea on
Wednesday and visit a steel mill and an historic city. He was
scheduled to wind up his four-day South Korea visit Thursday after
paying a courtesy call on President Kim Dae-jung.

<HEADLINE> Jets 20, Patriots 19  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE GOLDBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Skeptics kept telling the New York
Jets they needed a No. 1 receiver to replace Keyshawn Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   They had one all along in Wayne Chrebet, who caught two
touchdown passes in the final 6:25 Monday night as the Jets beat
the New England Patriots 20-19.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, John Abraham and Shaun Ellis, selected with
first-round picks the Jets got for Johnson and as compensation for
allowing Bill Belichick to leave to coach the Patriots, combined on
two sacks that ended New England's last shot.
</P>
<P>
   This game was billed in New York and New England as the ''Tuna
Helper Bowl,'' -- Belichick and Jets coach Al Groh, both in their
first years, spent much of their apprenticeship under Bill ''Tuna''
Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick was Parcells' designated successor but asked out after
spending one day last January as Jets coach. For most of the game,
Belichick's knowledge of New York's offense seemed to stifle the
Jets (2-0).
</P>
<P>
   New England built up a 12-7 lead on four field goals by Adam
Vinatieri and extended it to 19-7 on Drew Bledsoe's 4-yard TD pass
to Eric Bjornson with just under 10 minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   That seemed to energize the Jets, who drove 85 yards in 10 plays
to score on Testaverde's 2-yard TD pass to Chrebet. Fullback Richie
Anderson had five catches for 78 yards on that drive.
</P>
<P>
   New York got the ball back with 2:28 left.
</P>
<P>
   On the first play, Testaverde hit Dedric Ward for 44 yards, then
threw to Chrebet, who caught the ball at the 3 and dove into the
end zone with 1:55 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The 2-point conversion failed, but New England (0-2) went
nowhere. Abraham and Ellis combined on one sack of Bledsoe, and
Abraham got another on fourth down.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets moved the ball only once during the first half, going
74 yards on 12 plays on their first possession, scoring on
Testaverde's 4-yard pass to Fred Baxter. Despite his three TD
passes, Testaverde was just 16-of-37, although he did throw for 291
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde continued to show signs of rust from last year, when
he tore an Achilles' tendon in the first half of the first game
with the Patriots and missed the rest of the season. At one point,
he threw six straight incomplete passes, hit Chrebet for 28 yards,
then was sacked and threw two more incompletions.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Patriots plugged along between the 20s, getting
field goals of 32, 35, 30 and 33 yards from Vinatieri.
</P>
<P>
   Two were set up by punt returns of 31 and 38 yards by Troy
Brown, who had a 66-yard TD return and a 39 yarder last week. A
third was preceded by an interception that Antonio Langham returned
24 yards to the New York 14. But the Patriots never got close to
scoring a touchdown on any of those threats.
</P>
<P>
   New England drove from its own 26 to the New York 11 with the
opening kickoff of the second half. But Vinatieri's field-goal
attempt appeared to be deflected and went wide left.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe completed 25 of 43 passes for 229 yards but just the one
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the scoring was Vinatieri and that made the
difference.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers 6, Diamondbacks 3  </HEADLINE>
By MEL REISNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- On a night the New York Mets lost, the Arizona
Diamondbacks couldn't take advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield drove in two runs with two doubles, and emergency
starter Eric Gagne allowed one hit in six shutout innings to lead
the Los Angeles Dodgers over Arizona 6-3 Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona, which has lost five of seven, remained 4&AMP;frac12; games behind
the Mets, who lead the wild card race despite losing eight of 10.
New York lost to Milwaukee 8-2.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne (2-6), recalled from the minors earlier in the day,
started because Ismael Valdes felt numbness in his right hand.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne struck out seven and walked four in his first major league
appearance since July 27, winning for the first time in eight
starts since June 6.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Adams pitched the seventh, allowing an RBI single to Kelly
Stinnett, and Antonio Osuna, Mike Fetters and Jeff Shaw finished
the six-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles has won two straight following a five-game losing
streak, closing within two games of the Diamondbacks, who dropped
8&AMP;frac12; games behind NL West-leading San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Armando Reynoso (10-11) allowed five runs, eight hits and three
walks in 4 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield hit an RBI double in the first and Tom Goodwin homered
leading off a four-run fifth that included run-scoring doubles by
Sheffield and Adrian Beltre around Shawn Green's RBI single.
Arizona manager Buck Showalter had Todd Hundley intentionally
walked, bringing up Beltre, who was in a 1-for-10 slide.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros's RBI single made it 6-1 in the ninth. Jason Conti
hit a two-run homer in the bottom half, his first major league home
run.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Arizona's Luis Gonazlez caught a first-inning drive by
Hundley against the left-field fence. ... Diamondbacks RF Rob Ryan
threw out Karros at third in the seventh trying to stretch a double
into a triple. ... Along with Gagne, the Dodgers recalled IF Hiram
Bocachica and LHP Jeff Williams from Albuquerque. ... The
Diamondbacks are 6-13 since a season-best seven-game winning streak
ended on Aug. 21. ... Stinnett, a backup catcher most of the
season, made his third consecutive start and fourth in five games.

<HEADLINE> Jets Beat Patriots 20-19  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE GOLDBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Skeptics kept telling the New York
Jets they needed a No. 1 receiver to replace Keyshawn Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   They had one all along in Wayne Chrebet, who caught two
touchdown passes from Vinny Testaverde in the final 6:25 Monday
night as the Jets beat the New England Patriots 20-19.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just give me a chance,'' Chrebet told Testaverde before the
winning 28-yard TD pass with 1:55 left -- a fitting turn of
Johnson's phrase: ''Just throw me the damn ball.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a huge win for us and sets us up for the whole
season,'' Chrebet said.
</P>
<P>
   John Abraham and Shaun Ellis, selected with first-round picks
the Jets got for Johnson and as compensation for allowing Bill
Belichick to leave to coach the Patriots, combined on two sacks
that ended New England's last shot.
</P>
<P>
   This game was billed in New York and New England as the ''Tuna
Helper Bowl,'' -- Belichick and Jets coach Al Groh, both in their
first years, spent much of their apprenticeship under Bill ''Tuna''
Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick was Parcells' designated successor but asked out after
spending one day last January as Jets coach. For most of the game,
Belichick's knowledge of New York's offense seemed to stifle the
Jets (2-0).
</P>
<P>
   But he had some residual admiration at the end.
</P>
<P>
   ''Vinny made some great throws, Wayne made a couple of great
catches,'' said Belichick, who could have been on the opposite
sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ''I give them credit. At the end they came up with more plays
than we did.''
</P>
<P>
   New England built up a 12-7 lead on four field goals by Adam
Vinatieri and extended it to 19-7 on Drew Bledsoe's 4-yard TD pass
to Eric Bjornson with just under 10 minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   That seemed to energize the Jets, who drove 85 yards in 10 plays
to score on Testaverde's 2-yard TD pass to Chrebet. Fullback Richie
Anderson had five catches for 78 yards on that drive.
</P>
<P>
   New York got the ball back with 2:28 left.
</P>
<P>
   On the first play, Testaverde hit Dedric Ward for 44 yards, then
threw from 28 yards out to Chrebet, who caught the ball at the 3
and dove into the end zone with 1:55 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The 2-point conversion failed, but New England (0-2) went
nowhere. Abraham and Ellis combined on one sack of Bledsoe, and
Abraham got another on fourth down.
</P>
<P>
   ''As I was leaving the field, I kept thinking about how
fortunate we were to draft Ellis and Abraham,'' Groh said.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets moved the ball only once during the first half, going
74 yards on 12 plays on their first possession, scoring on
Testaverde's 4-yard pass to Fred Baxter. Despite his three TD
passes, Testaverde was just 16-of-37, although he did throw for 291
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde continued to show signs of rust from last year, when
he tore an Achilles' tendon in the first half of the first game
with the Patriots and missed the rest of the season. At one point,
he threw six straight incomplete passes, hit Chrebet for 28 yards,
then was sacked and threw two more incompletions.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Patriots plugged along between the 20s, getting
field goals of 32, 35, 30 and 33 yards from Vinatieri.
</P>
<P>
   Two were set up by punt returns of 31 and 38 yards by Troy
Brown, who had a 66-yard TD return and a 39 yarder last week. A
third was preceded by an interception that Antonio Langham returned
24 yards to the New York 14. But the Patriots never got close to
scoring a touchdown on any of those threats.
</P>
<P>
   New England drove from its own 26 to the New York 11 with the
opening kickoff of the second half. But Vinatieri's field-goal
attempt went wide left.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe completed 25 of 43 passes for 229 yards but just the one
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the scoring was Vinatieri and that made the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to get the ball in,'' Belichick said. ''We were down
there plenty of times. We've got to come up with more points.''
</P>
<P>
Notes: The last time the Jets started 2-0 was in 1994, when they
finished 6-10. ... Patriots defensive back Larry Whigham sprained
his right knee in the first quarter and did not return. ... New
England tackle Greg Robinson-Randall injured his right arm in the
second quarter. ... New England controlled the ball for 11:01 of
the scoreless third quarter, 20:33 of the second half, and 30:54 of
the last 45 minutes. ... The Patriots were 7-for-10 on third down
conversions during one stretch of the second half. They finished
7-for-12 in the half and 11-for-22 overall. ... Patriots C Damien
Woody left the game in the fourth quarter with a head injury....
Both of Baxter's touchdowns last season came against New England.

<HEADLINE> Athletics 5, Devil Rays 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND (AP) -- Kevin Appier pitched eight strong innings and Ben
Grieve drove in the go-ahead run in a four-run eighth as the
Oakland Athletics defeated the Tampa Bay Devil Rays 5-1 Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The A's moved within one game of Seattle in the AL West and 1&AMP;frac12;
games of wild card leader Cleveland. But the attendance was only
9,109 -- the lowest since May 18, when Oakland drew 8,746 against
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Velarde opened the eighth with a single against Doug Creek
(1-3) and advanced to third on Jason Giambi's single. Grieve then
sharply hit a 1-1 pitch from Creek into right field.
</P>
<P>
   Esteban Yan replaced Creek and threw two wild pitches -- with
only one runner advancing on each -- before striking out Adam Piatt.
Matt Stairs then delivered a two-run double and scored on a two-out
single by Eric Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   Appier (13-11) came within one inning of pitching the A's fourth
consecutive complete game, which hasn't been done since 1982. He
gave up one run and five hits with five strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Appier took a shutout into the sixth, extending the A's
scoreless streak to 23 innings. He didn't walk a batter either,
helping to set an Oakland record for consecutive innings without a
walk at 38 innings. The A's went 31 innings without issuing a free
pass between June 3-5, 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Harper allowed one run, two hits and four walks in five
innings in his second start with the Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland took a 1-0 lead in the second on Miguel Tejada's
sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the sixth, Felix Martinez tripled to the fence
in center field. Gerald Williams then bounced a double through a
drawn-in infield to tie it.
</P>
<P>
   The A's left the bases loaded in the third. After Terrence Long
singled, Velarde and Giambi walked with no outs. Harper got Grieve
to fly out to shallow left, then he struck out Piatt looking on a
full count and got Matt Stairs to fly out to left.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Devil Rays added three players to the roster: OF Randy
Winn, OF Ozzie Timmons, C Toby Hall. ... RHP Ryan Rupe was placed
on the 60-day DL with a blood clot in his right shoulder. ... LHP
Mike Duvall was designated for assignment. ... Durham manager Bill
Evers joined the Tampa Bay coaching staff for the rest of the
season. ... The A's added seven players to their roster: RHP Ariel
Prieto, RHP Scott Service, RHP Jon Ratliff, INF Mark Bellhorn, INF
Jose Ortiz, OF Eric Brynes, OF Bo Porter. ... Oakland also released
INF Joey Espada, designated LHP Leo Vasquez for assignment and
transferred 1B Mario Valdez to the 60-day DL. ... Appier went to
three balls on just two batters.

<HEADLINE> Royals 6, Mariners 3  </HEADLINE>
By JIM COUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- And now the Mariners' lead is down to a single
game.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Damon went 5-for-5 with a homer, two doubles and two RBIs
to lead the Kansas City Royals over Seattle 6-3 Monday night,
cutting the Mariners' AL West lead to its smallest margin since
Aug. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle is 9-19 since taking a seven-game lead on Aug. 11.
Second-place Oakland, which beat Tampa Bay 5-1, plays a four-game
series at Safeco Field next week.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Meadows (5-2) and Jose Santiago combined on a seven-hitter
for the Royals, who went ahead on Mike Sweeney's two-run homer in
the first off John Halama (11-9).
</P>
<P>
   Mariners reliever Kevin Hodges was ejected in the seventh after
throwing a pair of pitches close to Sweeney.
</P>
<P>
   Hodges hit Carlos Febles on a shoulder with a pitch in the sixth
and Meadows threw a pitch close to Alex Rodriguez's head in the
bottom half before striking him out.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently in retaliation, Hodges threw the first pitch of the
seventh close to Sweeney's head and was warned by plate umpire Dale
Scott. Scott then threw out Hodges after he threw a second pitch
inside.
</P>
<P>
   Halama (11-9) dropped to 0-3 in September, allowing four runs
and nine hits -- six for extra bases -- in 4 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Meadows gave up three runs and six hits in 6 2-3 innings, and
Santiago finished for his second save in eight chances.
</P>
<P>
   Damon, hitting .429 since the All-Star break, doubled leading
off the first and scored on Sweeney's 25th homer. He is batting
.516 (16-for-31) with two homers and four RBIs against the
Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Damon had a run-scoring single in the second, Joe Randa hit an
RBI double in the fifth and Carlos Beltran had a run-scoring
infield hit in the seventh for a 5-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Guillen had a two-run double in the seventh off Meadows,
and Jose Santiago walked Rodriguez with the bases loaded. Edgar
Martinez followed with an inning-ending flyout.
</P>
<P>
   Damon homered off Jose Mesa in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Damon's five hits gave him 196 for the season in his bid
for his first career 200-hit year. ... Damon's first five-hit game
came July 18 against the Chicago Cubs. ... Seattle 2B Mark McLemore
left with mild strain of his left hamstring after flying out in the
fifth. ... Sweeney's two RBIs gave him 131. He's two shy of tying
the team record set by Hal McRae in 1982. ... Meadows beat the
Mariners for the first time in his career after losing to them
twice when he was with the San Diego Padres this season. The Royals
acquired him July 31 in a trade.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Basketball Teams Escape Hotel  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Thanks to ''Zippy the Mohawk,'' the
U.S. Olympic basketball teams made it safely out of their besieged
hotel.
</P>
<P>
   In a bizarre scene that unfolded in the pre-dawn darkness
Tuesday, the American men's and women's teams made a safe exit -- or
perhaps it should be called an escape -- from their hotel, which was
the site of massive protests against the World Economic Forum.
</P>
<P>
   As their buses rolled up to barriers ringing the hotel's
perimeter, a small group of protesters were told Olympic athletes
were trying to leave. Thinking the police might be trying a ruse to
get forum delegates out, the protesters were skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   The police then invited one of them to come inside the barriers
and look for themselves, and a young man with a mohawk haircut
volunteered for the task.
</P>
<P>
   ''I looked in the first bus and it didn't look like a basketball
team, but then I looked inside the second bus,'' said the mohawked
man, Yanni Cotis of Adelaide. ''We had a quick discussion about
whether to let them go through and decided to let them leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Players and team personnel were half-amused and half-shocked
that their safe passage was in the hands of someone who looked like
a distant cousin of Billy Idol.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was nice of that guy to let us through,'' Jason Kidd said.
''It shows you how much power the (protesters) have.''
</P>
<P>
   The men's team held a two-hour practice after leaving the hotel,
then sat around the gymnasium for another hour with nothing to do
and no place to go. Their flight to Sydney was not due to depart
for several hours.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about their strange departure, they came up with a
nickname for the mohawk man: ''Zippy.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a good thing the U.S. teams got out when they did
because, by late morning, the crowds outside the Crown Casino and
Hotel had swelled in size to several thousand.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone among the USA Basketball contingent was aghast the
situation had gotten so out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   ''What kind of a place are we in when USA Basketball, the police
and 100 security guards have to get approval from a guy in a
mohawk? What does that tell you?'' Allan Houston said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. coach Rudy Tomjanovich, not wanting to offend anyone in the
host country, took a pass on criticizing the tactics of the local
police. With everyone safely out, he instead made light of the
great escape.
</P>
<P>
   ''Something I learned long ago was to expect the unexpected, and
this was one of those cases,'' he said. ''It was good we got out
and got our freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   The teams had planned to stay in Melbourne until later this
week, but the protests that virtually shut down the hotel forced a
hasty change in plans.
</P>
<P>
   The men's team had to cancel practice Monday because of the
protests, while the women's team made it out of the hotel on foot
before being forced to return by boat.
</P>
<P>
   USA Basketball officials had been warned months ago that they
could become circumstantial victims of the protests, but decided to
stick with their choice of accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they're moving on to Sydney with some strange stories to
tell.
</P>
<P>
   ''Very comical,'' said Alonzo Mourning. ''It keeps the trip
interesting and adds a little more excitement.''

<HEADLINE> National League Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Circling the bases for the first time in more than
two months,
Mark McGwire found out just how badly his knee still hurts.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ''My knee is really bad,'' McGwire said after hitting his first
home run since July 1. ''Every time I put all my weight on it by
running, it bites and it feels like it's going to tear.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, activated off the disabled list Friday, hit a two-run
homer in the first inning of the St. Louis Cardinals' 8-4 victory
Monday night over the Pittsburgh Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   He had been out with tendinitis in his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has been listed on the Cardinals' lineup card as a
second baseman the last four games -- and has left each time after
batting in the top of the first.
</P>
<P>
   On the road, McGwire can bat once and sit. In home games,
manager Tony La Russa will save him for critical pinch-hitting
situations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to be able to play in the field the rest of the
year,'' McGwire said.
</P>
<P>
   In other NL games Monday, it was Milwaukee beat the Mets 8-2,
Cincinnati topped the Cubs 7-6, San Francisco beat Houston 8-7 in
10 innings, Los Angeles defeated Arizona 6-3, and San Diego beat
Colorado 7-2. Philadelphia and Montreal split a doubleheader, with
the Phillies winning the first game 5-2, and the Expos taking the
second 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   The homer made McGwire feel like he's part of the team again.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't like to contribute vocally, I like to contribute with
my bat,'' he said. ''I'm just doing what I can right now and I'm
happy to be back in any capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrett Stephenson (16-8) won for the fifth time in six
decisions, allowing four runs, seven hits and four walks in seven
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Ravelo Manzanillo (2-2) took the loss for the Pirates.
Brewers 8, Mets 2:
</P>
<P>
   Paul Rigdon (3-3) allowed two runs and five hits in 6 2-3 solid
innings and Richie Sexson homered, dropping the Mets to 2-8 in
September.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets fell three games behind idle Atlanta in the NL East.
New York is 4&AMP;frac12; games ahead of Arizona in the wild card race.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Reed (9-5) allowed five runs and eight hits in six
innings.
Reds 7, Cubs 6:
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa hit his major league-leading 49th homer, but Jason
LaRue had a career-high five RBIs, hitting a three-run homer in the
second and a two-run double in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. left with a strained left hamstring after
colliding with Joe Girardi at home plate in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Harnisch (7-6) allowed five runs and eight hits in five
innings with five strikeouts, and Danny Graves pitched the ninth
for his 28th save.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Garibay (2-8) gave up six runs and six hits in four
innings.
Phillies 5, Expos 2:
Expos 7, Phillies 6:
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Blum atoned for his two errors in the opener by hitting a
go-ahead, two-run homer off Vicente Padilla (4-6) in the eighth
inning of the second game as Montreal gained a split.
</P>
<P>
   Blum's first-inning errors in the opener led to four unearned
runs as the Phillies eliminated Montreal from playoff contention.
</P>
<P>
   Guillermo Mota (1-1) got the final out in the seventh for the
win, and Scott Strickland got three outs for his fourth save.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Guerrero went 6-for-8 in the doubleheader, with a homer
in the first game and two RBIs in the nightcap.
</P>
<P>
   In the first game, Cliff Politte (3-2) gave up two runs and six
hits in eight innings, and Jeff Brantley pitched the ninth for his
23rd save. Dustin Hermanson (11-13) was the loser.
Giants 8, Astros 7:
</P>
<P>
   Barry Bonds tied the game with a two-run homer off Octavio Dotel
in the ninth, and Bill Mueller tripled home the go-ahead run off
Mark Valdez in the 10th. Bonds has 45 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Robb Nen (4-3) pitched 1 2-3 hitless innings.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Lima allowed homers to Jeff Kent and J.T. Snow, raising his
total to 44, two short of the NL record Robin Roberts set with
Philadelphia in 1956.
Dodgers 6, Diamondbacks 3:
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield drove in two runs with two doubles, and Eric
Gagne (2-6) allowed one hit in six shutout innings. Gagne struck
out seven and walked four in his first major league appearance
since July 27, winning for the first time in eight starts since
June 6.
</P>
<P>
   Armando Reynoso (10-11) allowed five runs, eight hits and three
walks in 4 1-3 innings as Arizona lost for the fifth time in seven
games.
Padres 7, Rockies 2:
</P>
<P>
   Woody Williams (10-5) pitched a six-hitter and John Mabry's
two-run single keyed a five-run first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's Todd Helton went 0-for-4, dropping his average to
.379. It hadn't been that low since Aug. 9, when he was batting
.378.
</P>
<P>
   Julian Tavarez (10-3) allowed five runs, walked two and hit a
batter as he recorded just one out in the first inning. It was the
shortest of his 21 career starts.

<HEADLINE> It's Shirts Off for Brandi  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- This time, Brandi Chastain kept her
shirt on. Those around her did not.
</P>
<P>
   When the U.S. women's soccer team visited the U.S. women's
basketball team's locker room after a weekend exhibition game, the
hoopsters did their own version of the Brandi Salute -- stripping
off their jerseys and twirling them over their heads, just as
Chastain did after scoring the winning penalty kick in the World
Cup final a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''They kind of relived it for me,'' Chastain said. ''A good 75
percent of them.''
</P>
<P>
   As the soccer team prepares for Thursday's Olympic first-round
match against Norway, no one has forgotten Chastain's moment of
exhilaration.
</P>
<P>
   When the players walk the streets here and explain which sport
they play, locals frequently ask which player removed her shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Chastain minds. Sure, the moment has been called
everything from exhibitionism to crass commercialism to
spontaneous, harmless fun. Whatever. It made an international star
out of someone seemingly born to be a celebrity, someone who can
take the jokes and respond with some of her own.
</P>
<P>
   ''Other than her bank account changing, she's the same as she
was,'' defender Kate Sobrero said. ''That's Brandi. Everything you
think she is, she is. The fame and everything has not affected her
at all. She's perfect for it.''
</P>
<P>
   While the defender nicknamed ''Hollywood'' hasn't changed, her
life has. She did the ''What's up with the shirt?'' commercial with
Kevin Garnett. She's thrown out the first pitch at a New York
Yankees game. At other public appearances, promoters and fans
wonder -- and sometimes ask -- if she'll reprise her jersey removal.
</P>
<P>
   Chastain always says no, but she loves to play along. Speaking
at a formal Olympic dinner in Washington earlier this year, she
joked about ripping off her dress.
</P>
<P>
   ''People ask me, 'Aren't you sick of it?' I say, 'Well, if it
means that people are thinking about soccer ... .' The message
wasn't taking off the jersey. The important part was what happened
during the game. ... In the past it was usually me preaching about
the game, and now it's people asking me about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chastain has maintained that the moment was simply a celebration
and was not preplanned either to promote herself or as a hidden
deal with Nike, which made the black sports bra she wore
underneath.
</P>
<P>
   Men and women routinely lift or take off their jerseys to
celebrate goals, and there was no way to predict the final against
China would go to a penalty shootout and that Chastain would have
the last kick.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no conjuring this whole plan beforehand,'' Chastain
said.
</P>
<P>
   There have been long debates as to whether Chastain set back
women's sports with her momentary show of flesh or moved them ahead
with a brave show of liberation. Often lost with that debate is the
skewed image of a very good soccer player.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a dual thing going on there,'' coach April Heinrichs
said. ''There's the issue of her taking her shirt off. In that
regard, she's become very, very popular. She's also a pretty face.
That's the nature of where we are in athletics. Some of us are
still there. The next step is for us to recognize what a truly
great soccer player she is among truly great soccer players''
</P>
<P>
   Chastain has been a regular on the national team since 1996. She
is eighth all-time with 132 games played, and her 23 goals is
second all-time among defenders behind Joy Fawcett's 24.
</P>
<P>
   Staying in shape was her problem early in her career, but -- as
her jersey-toss showed -- she has muscles that would put many male
athletes to shame. She also is an intelligent student of the game,
even spending her honeymoon at the 1998 men's World Cup in France.
</P>
<P>
   ''The attention is on the exterior rather than on the quality of
play between the white lines,'' Heinrichs said. ''There are some
great players that no one ever notices. Joy Fawcett, Kate Sobrero,
Kristine Lilly. If you compare Brandi to her teammates, there are
other players as worthy as well.''
</P>
<P>
   But Chastain is the only one who's ever put on a special
celebration at the Rose Bowl in front of the largest American
television audience ever for a soccer game.
</P>
<P>
   ''Timing and opportunity collide,'' Heinrichs said. ''And that
was last summer was for Brandi.''

<HEADLINE> Convicted killer's attorneys to ask federal court to stop execution </HEADLINE>
By BOB LEWIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) - Defense lawyers hope to persuade a federal
judge Tuesday to halt the execution of a convicted killer and find
out why key evidence briefly vanished.
</P>
<P>
   The court has become Derek Barnabei's only hope to avoid
execution by injection Thursday night. Gov. Jim Gilmore ruled out
clemency Monday, saying that DNA tests of blood on fingernail
clippings from the victim conclusively matched Barnabei, a Somers
Point, N.J. native.
</P>
<P>
   But defense lawyers plan to ask U.S. District Judge James
Spencer to order more DNA tests. Also pending is a decision on a
lawsuit filed Friday that contends the brief disappearance of
evidence violated Barnabei's constitutional rights.
</P>
<P>
   Key evidence, including material that underwent DNA testing,
vanished from Aug. 29 to Sept. 1, and Gilmore has ordered a state
police investigation into the disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   Barnabei, 33, faces the death penalty for the 1993 rape and
murder of Sarah Wisnosky, a 17-year-old college freshman he had
been dating. The victim was strangled and struck repeatedly with a
blunt instrument.
</P>
<P>
   Barnabei's attorney Seth Tucker said he's still seeking DNA
tests on vaginal swabs from the victim's body and on a bloody towel
collected as evidence but never tested.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's entirely possible that the killer's blood will be found
on that towel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Gilmore said the tests performed during the
weekend turned up DNA from Wisnosky and ''a positive match with one
and only one individual - Derek Rocco Barnabei.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore also said he is convinced that the fingernails had not
been tampered with.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were still maintained in a sealed envelope with the same
forensic tape still on it,'' he said. ''They were totally intact.''

<HEADLINE> Yanks' Strawberry Is Arrested Again  </HEADLINE>
By FRED GOODALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Darryl Strawberry's future is again in the
hands of Hillsborough Circuit Judge Florence Foster.
</P>
<P>
   The judge who placed the suspended New York Yankees outfielder
on probation last year in a drug and solicitation case was to
preside over a hearing Tuesday for Strawberry, who was arrested for
a traffic accident.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry, who's battled cancer and drug abuse, was held
without bail Monday after an off-duty officer said he saw the
player scrape a road sign before turning onto another street and
rear-ending an SUV stopped at a red light.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry's lawyer said the player took prescription medication
before he ''blacked out'' at the wheel of his sports utility
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ''He took some kind of medication and that apparently caused
some reaction and made him pass out,'' attorney Joseph Ficarrotta
said. ''Where in the sequence he blacked out I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry faces two misdemeanor charges -- driving while
impaired and leaving the scene of an accident with damage -- plus
two counts of probation violation, which normally would not let him
go free on bond.
</P>
<P>
   Ficarrotta planned to ask Foster to consider releasing
Strawberry to his home or to set bond at the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry, who had cancer surgery last month, told officers he
had taken the sleeping medication Ambien, according to Hillsborough
County sheriff's spokesman Rod Reder.
</P>
<P>
   Ficarrotta said Strawberry also has prescriptions for the
narcotic painkillers Percocet and Vicodin.
</P>
<P>
   The outfielder failed a field-sobriety test but a blood-alcohol
test showed no alcohol in his system. He volunteered a urine sample
for testing, and those results will take days.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry told deputies he was heading to a meeting with his
probation officer. When he tried to drive on after hitting the SUV,
Sgt. Anthony Kolka pulled over and confronted the player with his
pistol drawn.
</P>
<P>
   The officer said he banged on the window to get Strawberry's
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ''He just wanted to know: 'What did I do? What did I do?' like
he didn't know what happened,'' Kolka said. ''He said he didn't
know he hit the car or the sign.''
</P>
<P>
   The officer, heading home in an unmarked car, said he was
unaware the driver was Strawberry until a passerby told him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't thinking about who the person was. My idea was to get
him out of the car, get him secured,'' Kolka said. ''All I knew was
the vehicle needed to be stopped to see what the problem was.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanya Whitaker, 32, said Strawberry tried to drive around her
SUV after the impact, and that's when she saw the deputy first
trying to stop him.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had the gun to Darryl's window. He was trying to leave,''
said Whitaker, of nearby Land O'Lakes. ''Once the police officer
realized who he (Strawberry) was, he said, 'You aren't going to run
from this one.'''
</P>
<P>
   No one was injured. Damage totaled about $1,000 to Whitaker's
car and $1,800 to Strawberry's vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry was suspended for most of last season after his
arrest in Tampa in April 1999 on drug and solicitation charges.
</P>
<P>
   He pleaded no contest and was sentenced by Foster to 18 months'
probation. He was suspended from baseball for a year in February, a
month after he tested positive for cocaine
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry, who had surgery for colon cancer in 1998 and for a
stomach tumor last month, has follow-up doctor's appointments
scheduled in Tampa and New York, where he had his latest operation.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's very serious and just anxious to hopefully get out and
continue his treatment,'' Ficarrotta said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a serious thing, and he knows that.''

<HEADLINE> Olympic Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Need further proof that the world is
upside down in Australia?
</P>
<P>
   A dozen NBA multimillionaires were briefly trapped on their bus
by angry protesters Tuesday morning (Monday EDT) -- until one
demonstrator, sporting a mohawk hairdo, deigned to set them free.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was stunned by the whole situation,'' Phoenix Suns forward
Antonio McDyess said after the bizarre encounter outside a
Melbourne hotel. ''How could they let a guy in a mohawk be their
leader?''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. men's and women's basketball teams were both stranded
outside the Crown Casino and Hotel, held up by protesters in town
for the World Economic Forum. Demonstrators outside the hotel
initially refused to let the teams' buses pass.
</P>
<P>
   It was only after a protester with a punk rock haircut verified
the bus was filled with towering athletes, not venture capitalists,
that the teams were allowed to leave.
</P>
<P>
   The men's team held a two-hour practice after their great
escape, and both teams planned to relocate to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ''What kind of a place are we in when USA Basketball, the police
and 100 security guards have to get approval from a guy in a
mohawk?'' wondered Allan Houston. ''What does that tell you?''
</P>
<P>
   Once they were done shaking their heads, the hoopsters came up
with a nickname for Mr. Mohawk: They dubbed him ''Zippy.''
</P>
<P>
   -- SOCCER: Olympic soccer arrives two days before the torch hits
the Olympic Stadium, with a half-dozen games on tap for Wednesday.
The Olympic soccer competition kicks off with games featuring
defending gold medalist Nigeria and host team Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. plays its first game as well, taking on the Czech
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the jump on the Sydney Games will be 92,500 fans
expected at the Melbourne Cricket Ground as Australia takes on
Italy in the most anticipated match of day one. Nigeria, which
defeated traditional powers Brazil and Argentina to take the 1996
gold, opens against Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   In the other men's game, Cameroon battles Kuwait. Women's soccer
opens as well, with the distaff Australians facing Germany in
Canberra and Sweden meeting Brazil in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
   -- TENNIS: Anke Huber, the world's 10th-ranked women's tennis
player, has withdrawn from the Sydney Games with a tendon injury in
her right arm. Huber, considered Germany's best chance for a tennis
medal, needs to rest the arm for three weeks, according to the
German team doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anke cannot play in Sydney,'' said Dr. Walter Knapper. ''Her
health takes precedence.''
</P>
<P>
   Huber injured her arm playing in the U.S. Open. The Olympic
tennis tournament begins Sept. 19.
</P>
<P>
   -- GYMNASTICS: A stress fracture in her left foot forced
17-year-old Morgan White, the youngest member of the U.S.
gymnastics team, to pull out of the games.
</P>
<P>
   The injury has plagued White since last month's Olympic trials,
and forced her to sit out all but one event of the team's Texas
exhibition earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Her replacement: 15-year-old Tasha Schwikert, who was the second
alternate after the Olympic Trials. The gymnastics selection
committee leap-frogged Schwikert over first alternate Alyssa
Beckerman, citing more consistent performances at the pre-Olympic
training camp.
</P>
<P>
   -- BASEBALL: The American baseball team suffered a 4-3 loss to
the Netherlands in an Olympic warmup, its first defeat in five
pre-Olympic games. The Netherlands' Rikkert Faneyte beat the United
States with his bat and his arm, knocking in three runs with a
bases-loaded double and pitching in the ninth to pick up the save.
</P>
<P>
   John Rauch was the starter and loser for the Americans, who were
led by Brad Walkerson's three hits.
</P>
<P>
   -- CHINESE ARRIVAL: A bit depleted by failed drug tests, the
Chinese Olympic delegation touched down in Sydney to find a local
welcome wagon that included a half-dozen nuns with their heads
shaved.
</P>
<P>
   ''Warm welcome from Buddha's Light, warm welcome from Buddha's
Light,'' chanted the nuns, member of the Taiwan-based Buddha's
Light International Association.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese teams includes 284 athletes, but another 13 were
left at home after failing blood tests for the
performance-enhancing drug EPO. That group included six runners
trained by famed coach Ma Junren.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the delegation deflected questions about the failed
drug tests.
</P>
<P>
   ''The spokesman of the Chinese Olympic Committee has already
given an explanation for this,'' said Cai Jiadong, a fencing
official. ''It doesn't have much to do with me.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Criticized Over Executions  </HEADLINE>
By KELLEY SHANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush gets criticized for his
hands-off approach to state executions, but state law leaves little
room for governors to act in these life-and-death decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, allows
the 18-member Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles to do its job
freely by maintaining an arm's-length relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor leaves it up to each parole board member to make
their own decisions after they review the case. They're an
independent body,'' said Bush spokesman Mike Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Others contend that Bush does direct the board -- through his
public statements on executions and his power to appoint members to
their six-year, $80,000-per-year jobs.
</P>
<P>
   All current board members are Bush appointees.
</P>
<P>
   ''It does seem that they would want to be in line with his way
of thinking about it,'' said Richard C. Dieter, executive director
of the Death Penalty Information Center.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he supports the death penalty and doesn't believe
an innocent person has been executed in Texas during his
administration.
</P>
<P>
   But David Dow, a University of Houston law professor who
represents condemned inmates, suggests both Bush and his Democratic
predecessor, Ann Richards, have used the parole board ''as an
excuse to avoid having to make a tough, moral decision.''
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, the governor can only issue a one-time, 30-day
reprieve or act on a recommendation of the parole board to grant a
stay, commute a sentence or issue a pardon. Those limits evolved
from a pardons scandal in the 1920s and are aimed at preventing a
governor from granting continuous reprieves.
</P>
<P>
   Since Bush became governor in 1995, the state has executed 143
people, including 32 this year. Texas has executed 231 people in
the past two decades, the most in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Three more executions are scheduled before the Nov. 7
presidential election, including that of high-profile inmate Ricky
Nolen McGinn on Sept. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Bush granted a 30-day reprieve for McGinn in June -- the only
reprieve he has granted as governor -- so that further DNA testing
could be done. But the tests failed to clear McGinn in the rape and
murder of his 12-year-old stepdaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Bush never has witnessed an execution. For the most part, he
limits his role to privately quizzing his attorneys about cases,
aides say.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Richards, who met with her general counsel about
executions, Bush has met with the staff lawyers who studied
condemned inmates' cases, said Jim Sallans, a former staff attorney
who reviewed death row cases for both governors. Sallans left after
Bush's first term.
</P>
<P>
   Bush would read the lawyer's memo -- about three to four pages --
and talk with the attorney, usually from 15 minutes to 45 minutes
but perhaps up to two hours, Sallans said.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Sallans said, Bush would ask: ''OK, Did he do it?
Did he get a fair trial?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not try to instruct the board how to vote, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's political suicide,'' Sallans said.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Garrett, the board chairman, said Bush takes a hands-off
approach with members, telling them, ''in essence, make the right
decision and if there is political fallout, so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor does not have the power to declare a
moratorium on executions, as Illinois Gov. George Ryan, a
Republican, has done.
</P>
<P>
   But some suggest Bush, if concerned about the fairness of Texas'
death penalty, could use his power of persuasion to generate public
support for a moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   ''He could have a much higher profile in the Texas death penalty
debate, if he wanted to,'' said Dow, the professor who has
represented inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Dow also contends that governors can communicate with the parole
board as much as they wish, through direct dialogue or public
statements.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: Henry Lee Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush asked the parole board to investigate the conviction of
Lucas, a drifter sentenced to death for the murder of an
unidentified woman known as ''Orange Socks.''
</P>
<P>
   The parole board recommended commuting Lucas' sentence to life
in prison, and Bush approved it in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Karla Faye Tucker -- a pickax murderer, a Christian
convert and the first woman executed in Texas since the Civil War
era -- was more clear-cut for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told him that's an easy one,'' Sallans recalls. ''She did
it, she confessed to it, she got a very fair trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucker was executed in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
   As for Graham, Bush maintained his public silence about the case
until the end, despite being dogged about it on the campaign trail.
Graham maintained his innocence in the murder of a man during a
1981 holdup.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Bush said he agreed with the parole board's vote in
favor of Graham's execution.
</P>
<P>
   ''After considering all the facts,'' he said, ''I am confident
justice is being done.''

<HEADLINE> Governor Role in Pardons Dates Back  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- The Texas governor's limited power to grant
reprieves and pardons for condemned inmates is rooted in a 1920s
scandal linked to the state's first woman governor.
</P>
<P>
   Miriam ''Ma'' Ferguson served two two-year terms, from 1925-27
and from 1933-35. She first ran for office using the slogan ''Two
governors for the price of one'' after her husband, impeached
former Gov. James ''Pa'' Ferguson, was denied a place on the
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Ma Ferguson campaigned as a fiscal conservative who opposed
prohibition and the Ku Klux Klan and sought to clear her husband's
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Her first term was notable for the unusually high number of
pardons she granted, averaging 100 per month, more than 2,000
during the two-year term, according to the Texas State Library.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of bribery circulated, and the number of pardons became
the subject of political jokes in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   After her term, the Board of Pardon Advisers that had existed
since 1893 was replaced with a three-member Board of Pardons and
Paroles appointed by the governor. That board, which was given
constitutional status in 1936, was charged with giving the governor
advice on clemency petitions, limiting the governor's previously
wide-ranging pardon authority.
</P>
<P>
   The board was expanded to six members in 1983 and to 18 members
in 1990. The governor appoints board members to six-year terms,
paid $80,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, in a death penalty case, the governor can issue a
one-time, 30-day reprieve or act on a recommendation of the parole
board to grant a stay, commute a sentence or issue a pardon.

<HEADLINE> Home for disabled under new scrutiny  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - State regulators have banned a home for
the disabled from taking new admissions.
</P>
<P>
   In an Aug. 31 letter, regulators accused the Continuing
Development Service of a ''continued failure'' to comply with
health care standards at a home in the Rochester suburb of
Henrietta, where 14 disabled people live.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors with the Office of Mental Retardation and
Developmental Disabilities determined that residents were not in
danger because of the care at Beckwith Road. But, because of
repeated violations, the state plans to sanction the facility.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors cited numerous lapses, ranging from problems in
administering medication to errors in the maintenance of records
about residents.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions are one step short of the most punitive measure
regulators could take - revoking the home's state-issued
certification. Had the state done that, it would have had to
provide care for the Beckwith residents.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, the state Department of Health must approve the
sanctions at Beckwith.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Health spokeswoman Claire Pospisil said the
department, which oversees the Medicaid funding directed to the
Beckwith home and its residents, agrees sanctions are needed.

<HEADLINE> 'Survivor' Book Praised  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The next chapter in the ''Survivor'' saga is,
fittingly, a book. THE book. The official ''Survivor'' book.
</P>
<P>
   Just out, it's a good read. Good enough, in fact, to remind
anyone who needs reminding that -- doggone it! -- a book can be as
good as a TV show.
</P>
<P>
   ''Survivor'' The Book is co-written by Mark Burnett, the
brilliant auteur of the CBS adventure-game show that gripped the
nation this summer.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a bit fatuous for him to liken ''Survivor'' to a
''clever 'nature-based' way of providing men and women with an
opportunity to discover who they really were.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the value of Burnett's book is that he alone has the
big picture. Not only was he onsite and privy to the 1,300 hours of
tape pared down for the series' 13 episodes; he was the guy who
hatched the whole scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Published by TV Books, ''Survivor'' is nicely timed to the
marathon rebroadcast of ''Survivor'' The Series, beginning Friday
on an almost nightly basis.
</P>
<P>
   CBS has dubbed this encore ''the Olympic Alternative,'' which it
surely will be. For ''Survivor,'' the game is over and the
million-dollar winner, Richard Hatch, identified. This time around,
the 39 days on Pulau Tiga will unfold not as a contest but as a
drama building step by step to the outcome you already know.
</P>
<P>
   For an enhanced viewing experience, you might want to have the
''Official Companion Book'' within easy reach, a bit like an
opera-goer bringing the libretto to the performance.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe you're among those who too proudly declare, ''You know,
I haven't seen a minute of 'Survivor.''' Fine. Consider this book a
useful crash course in cultural awareness.
</P>
<P>
   So there you have it: a TV series; a book. If only that were
all.
</P>
<P>
   But it's only the beginning. There is no need (or space) to
recap the product tie-ins, merchandising strategies and
cross-promotions represented by ''Survivor'' The Brand.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there any point in recounting all of the promotional
appearances by the 16 castaways, dispatched by CBS to its fellow
Viacom-owned outlets and beyond like members of a speaker's bureau
from hell.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone remembers how, all summer, each ousted castaway not
only popped up on ''Late Show With David Letterman,'' but also
rotated through CBS News' ''Early Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Local CBS newscasts jumped on the bandwagon: ''From the nation's
large markets to the small,'' reports Broadcasting &AMP; Cable
magazine, ''CBS affiliates rallied behind 'Survivor' to swell the
audience bases for its newscasts.''
</P>
<P>
   Dandy: Whip up entertainment you can cover as news. Then cover
it by being part of the entertainment package. Perfect circularity.
</P>
<P>
   It's even dandier if you can lay claim, as CBS can, to your own
in-house ''independent'' analyst. Last month, CBS' top publicist
Gil Schwartz did an interview on National Public Radio -- but as his
alter ego Stanley Bing, a wry observer of corporate life whose
credits include books and a Fortune magazine column.
</P>
<P>
   Bing was invited to discuss what ''Survivor'' revealed about
office politics, and he happily complied. But the NPR reporter
didn't know she was really talking to Schwartz, the ''Survivor''
network's ranking mouthpiece. And ''Bing'' didn't tell her.
</P>
<P>
   A wised-up (and irked) NPR issued a clarification on the next
day's ''Morning Edition.''
</P>
<P>
   Now here's a larger issue deserving clarification: The essence
of an enterprise like ''Survivor'' isn't entertainment in hour-long
installments. Instead, ''Survivor'' in its purest state is a plasma
rush channeled through the marketplace, sweeping you from one
''Survivor'' come-on to the next.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of ''Survivor''? Not to please you, but to sell you.
Over and over.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors' beer, cell phones and running shoes. CBS' fall lineup
(look for Gervase in a commercial for ''Judging Amy'' and Rich
touting ''Bette''). Official T-shirts and bandannas you can order
on the CBS Web site. Letterman and Bryant Gumbel. They have all
been hawked through the carefully orchestrated graces of
''Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   This is nothing new or even unusual. In children's TV,
practically every series aims to give its moppet audience the
plasma rush. Books, toys, macaroni and cheese -- how many ways can
''Rugrats'' close a sale?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, ''Rugrats'' happens to be great TV. So is
''Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a world where an analyst and a spin doctor are sometimes
just two sides of the same coin (or psyche), the audience is faced
with a new set of rules. The challenge becomes less one of choosing
between good and bad than of separating substance from puffery and
profiteering.
</P>
<P>
   With ''Survivor,'' watch the show. Read the book. And avoid all
the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Just try.

<HEADLINE> Harry Potter To Be Released in China  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Harry Potter is coming to China.
</P>
<P>
   A state-owned publisher plans to release Chinese translations of
the first three of British author J.K. Rowling's wildly popular
books about the young wizard in October.
</P>
<P>
   The books were translated by a three-member team of women
specially chosen because of their supposed maternal instincts, said
Wang Ruiqin, head of the children's book division of the People's
Literature Publishing House.
</P>
<P>
   ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,'' ''Harry Potter and
the Chamber of Secrets'' and ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of
Azkaban'' are to be released simultaneously, Wang said. She said
the company will print 100,000 to 200,000 copies of each.
</P>
<P>
   The deal puts the state-owned firm in the unusual position of
promoting to children novels about the occult at the same time that
the government is cracking down on religious groups that it claims
spread dangerous superstition.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't clear how the Chinese translators would deal with such
delicate issues. Wang said they were not available for interviews.
One has left China to work at the United Nations, while another is
elderly and hospitalized, she said.
</P>
<P>
   People's Literature is negotiating for rights to Rowling's
fourth, newly published book, ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of
Fire,'' Wang said.

   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 26.26 at 11,169.23.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed Tuesday after two straight

   In early trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial

</P>
<P>
   Shares of Kroger also were slightly higher, up 13 cents at

   Tenet Healthcare's shares were up $2.06 at $33.69 after the

</P>
<P>
   Investors also took another look Tuesday at some of the stocks
they had shunned the day before. Shares of Sun Microsystems rose
$3.25 to $118.50, after dropping more than $4 on Monday. JDS
Uniphase's stock was up $2 to $111.75, still more than a $1 below
its opening price a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, technology stocks pushed the Dow, Nasdaq and S&AMP;P
down, despite surges in some energy and financial services stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues narrowly outnumbered decliners on the New York
Stock Exchange. Volume came to 130.38 million shares, compared with

<HEADLINE> Berlin Opera Director Won't Renew  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Conductor Daniel Barenboim will not renew his
contract as artistic director of Berlin's State Opera when it
expires in 2002, city officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Barenboim, 57, no longer wants to continue with the
administrative aspects of his job and would like to become the
Staatsoper's musical director instead, the Berlin city culture
department said.
</P>
<P>
   However, he made staying on in Berlin dependent on an increase
in funding for all three Berlin opera houses. The cash-strapped
Berlin local government is unlikely to do this on its own and has
been negotiating with the federal government for an injection of
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Barenboim signed a 10-year contract with the Staatsoper in 1992.
He also is chief musical conductor at the Chicago Symphony
Orchestra.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Investor enthusiasm for technology stocks helped
push the markets higher Tuesday after two straight sessions of
losses due to uncertainty about third-quarter earnings.

</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the market volatility reflected the uncertainty of
many investors heading into third-quarter corporate earnings
season.
</P>
<P>
   With more data suggesting economic growth is slowing, the chance
of another interest rate hike this year by the Federal Reserve is
fading. But investors remain unsure of what the slowdown will do to
corporate earnings reports and don't know where to put their money,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can understand why the market would be concerned about
earnings but I think it's misplaced,'' said Kevin Caron, an
associate strategist with Gruntal &AMP; Co. ''By the end of the year,
you'll se a growth rate of about 4 percent. .... What we're seeing

sustainable.''

   Tech stocks moved up Tuesday while energy issues moved down, a
reversal of trading Monday, when tech pushed the Dow, Nasdaq and

   Shares of Best Buy were up $2.63 at $67.06 after the consumer
electronics retailer beat Wall Street estimates for second-quarter

<HEADLINE> 12 Killed in Kashmir Attack  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SRINAGAR, India (AP) -- Islamic militants entered an army camp in
India's Kashmir state and started an overnight gunbattle that left
at least four soldiers and three militants dead, the army reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But an Indian police officer said at least 12 soldiers were
killed and 25 wounded in the attack. The differing numbers could
not be reconciled immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The men died during a gunfight between militants and soldiers at
the camp in Berwah, 25 miles northwest of Srinagar, the army said.
The fighting began late Monday and ended Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Lashkar-e-Tayyaba, a Pakistan-based Islamic militant group,
telephoned The Associated Press office in Srinagar and claimed
responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Usama, the group's spokesman, said three militants were
killed -- two of them belonging to the Lashkar-e-Tayyaba and the
third to the Jamayet-ul-Mujahedeen militant group.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen militant groups are fighting to sever Kashmir
from India. More than 26,000 people have been killed in the
fighting that began in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   India accuses neighboring Pakistan of backing the insurgency, a
charge Pakistan denies. The Himalayan territory is divided between
the two countries, and both claim the whole region.

<HEADLINE> Cluny Museum Prepares New Garden  </HEADLINE>
By MARILYN AUGUST
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- With not a blade of grass left from the original
gardens planted 500 years ago, landscape artists dug deep into
medieval botanical manuscripts to design the new gardens opening
this month at France's National Museum of the Middle Ages.
</P>
<P>
   The gardens, covering 53,820 square feet between the Hotel de
Cluny, as it is popularly known, and the Boulevard Saint-Germain,
are planted with 58 species of flora and fauna depicted in ''La
Dame a la Licorne'' (Lady with the Unicorn), the series of
priceless medieval tapestry on display in the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Located on the site of what began in the 1st Century as
Gallo-Roman thermal baths and ended up as a Roman Catholic convent
in the 15th century, the museum is one of the most popular tourist
sites in Paris, drawing some 300,000 visitors yearly.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were absolutely no traces left of the urban gardens
around the old Cluny Abbey, so the new garden is not a historical
reconstitution. It's inspired by the Middle Ages as we know it
today,'' Paris Mayor Jean Tiberi said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Besides lily of the valley, hawthorne, holly, giant daffodils
and daisies, there are plants such as mint, sage, absinthe and
thyme, which were highly prized for their medicinal qualities.
</P>
<P>
   Another section is devoted to the medieval diet, with plantings
of cabbage, onions and chives.
</P>
<P>
   ''I spent two full months tracking down each plant, bush and
tree in the tapestries,'' said Marie-Therese Gousset, art historian
and medieval manuscript expert. ''There were 13 trees and bushes,
and 59 species of flowers,'' Gousset said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was able to identify all but one -- and I'm convinced it's an
invention of the artist,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The gardens were designed by French landscape artists Eric
Ossart and Arnaud Maurieres, who spent years studying botanical,
architectural, spiritual and aesthetic manuscripts from the 14th
and 15th centuries.
</P>
<P>
   They also feature a play area for toddlers, complete with mini
jungle-gyms resembling the rabbits, deer and unicorn from the
tapestries.
</P>
<P>
   Among the highlights is a sleek water fountain ringed by
flowers. The contemporary design in polished stainless steel by
French sculptor Brigitte Nahon evokes oversized blades of grass and
giant dew drops.
</P>
<P>
   The gardens open to the public Sept. 23.

<HEADLINE> South Africa Mayor Quits in Scandal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- The mayor of Cape Town's
metropolitan council resigned Tuesday after he was caught
downloading pornography from the Internet and watching pornographic
videos in his office.
</P>
<P>
   William Bantom, an ordained minister, was asked to quit after he
was caught last week dabbling with pornography for a second time
despite an earlier warning, provincial premier Gerald Morkel said.
</P>
<P>
   Bantom is mayor of the metropolitan council, the organization
that coordinates services throughout the city's seven districts.
</P>
<P>
   At least one of the Internet sites Bantom was caught viewing
involved children and adults having sex.
</P>
<P>
   Morkel said he had first been informed last year that Bantom had
logged on to a number of pornographic sites.

   ''I was deeply shocked and called Bantom in to discuss the issue
with him,'' Morkel said. ''Initially, he said that he required the
information for a thesis on which he was working, but when I
pressed him, he broke down and said it would never happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Bantom was given another chance, but at the end of last week he
was discovered playing adult pornographic videos in his office when
a staff member turned on his television to watch cricket.
</P>
<P>
   Bantom, 54, said he had let his colleagues, friends and family
down, and thought it fit to resign.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have erred, both as a Christian and as a member of my
community, and I pray that my fellow Christians and the community
will find it in their hearts to forgive me,'' he told the South
African Press Association.

<HEADLINE> Vatican Cardinal To Visit China  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- A top cardinal is heading to China this week
on a rare visit by a senior Vatican official to the communist
country.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican, in announcing the trip Tuesday, said Cardinal Roger
Etchegaray will attend a forum on ''Religion and Peace'' in his
personal capacity and was not on a diplomatic mission.
</P>
<P>
   Etchegaray, a Frenchman who heads the Vatican's Holy Year
Committee, visited China in 1993 -- at the time, spurring
speculation that the Vatican and China were preparing to end their
nearly half-century standoff. But the Chinese government played
down the visit.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday with Vatican Radio, the cardinal said he
was ''not going to negotiate for the Holy See'' but that his mere
presence will be a ''very positive factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Communist China severed diplomatic ties with the Vatican in the
1950s, formed its own Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association and
does not recognize papal religious authority.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing has also consistently demanded that the Vatican break
ties with Taiwan as a condition for restoring diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican did not exclude possible contacts with the Patriotic
association, but said they must ''not be interpreted as a
recognition'' of that church's hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   The trip comes at a time when human rights groups say China has
been cracking down on religions outside state control, including
Roman Catholics. Etchegaray acknowledged that ''some of the news
that reaches us is serious and not reassuring.''
</P>
<P>
   Etchegaray will be in Beijing for three days, starting Thursday,
for the meeting the Vatican said was organized by an
Italian-Chinese cultural association.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Approve Gay Marriages  </HEADLINE>
By ANTHONY DEUTSCH
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- The Netherlands, long among the
gay rights vanguard, enacted a bill converting the country's
''registered same-sex partnerships'' into full-fledged marriages,
complete with divorce guidelines and wider adoption rights for
gays.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say the legislation will give Dutch gays rights
beyond those offered in any other country.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers thumped their desks in approval when the vote passed
109-33, and some of the scores of witnesses in the packed public
gallery applauded and embraced.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament had discussed the bill last week, when only a few
small Christian parties voiced opposition during an emotional and
often heated three-day debate. It gained speedy approval Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very happy. What happened today represents changes in our
society,'' said Mark Wagenbuur, 34. He said he and his partner, who
came with him to watch the vote, will now formally wed, but their
immediate problem is ''we don't know who should ask whom.''
</P>
<P>
   In Norway and Sweden, gay couples can already register their
partnerships and Denmark has gone a step further -- it was the first
country to allow gay marriages in 1989. Two years ago, the
Netherlands enacted a law allowing same-sex couples to register as
partners and to claim pensions, social security and inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   But the new Dutch legislation goes farther, creating full
equality for gays, activists said.
</P>
<P>
   Same-sex couples will be able to marry at city hall and adopt
Dutch children. They will be able to divorce through the court
system, like heterosexual couples.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Dittrich, a member of the centrist Democrats 66 party and
a proponent of the plan, said the law ''acknowledges that a
person's sex is not of importance for marriage.'' He spoke during
what he called ''the most moving debate'' of his parliamentary
career.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will be able to call it what it is and that's marriage,''
said Henk Krol, an activist and editor-in-chief of the Gay Krant
magazine. He said the vote ''will be an absolute first in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   The law is expected to take effect early next year. Krol said he
plans to convert his own partnership status to marriage as soon as
it does.
</P>
<P>
   Displaying unusual solidarity, all three parliamentary factions
in the governing coalition -- the left-of-center Labor Party, the
Liberal VVD and the smaller Democrats 66 -- backed the proposal.
Even a few members of the biggest opposition party, the largely
traditional Christian Democratic Alliance, or CDA, have expressed
support.
</P>
<P>
   The plan hasn't been recognized by the dominant Protestant or
Roman Catholic churches, but a few breakaway churches have sent
encouraging letters to legislators.
</P>
<P>
   The Remonstrant Brethren, which broke from the Protestant church
in 1619, was one step ahead of the Dutch parliament, having
accepted gay marriages in 1986. The Remonstrants and a group called
the Old Catholic Church are the best-known supporters of gay rights
here.
</P>
<P>
   While gays will enjoy new liberties in the Netherlands, they may
run into trouble when they travel in countries where homosexuality
remains illegal. The Foreign Affairs Ministry has proposed offering
legal assistance to Dutch citizens in such cases.
</P>
<P>
   Some opponents fear the unique position of gays could isolate
the Dutch and set the Netherlands apart.
</P>
<P>
   The bill will create ''a world without foundations ... where the
historical understanding of marriage is torn from its roots,'' said
Kees van der Straaij of the Reformed Political Party.

<HEADLINE> Cops Detain 2 After Putin Collision  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Police have detained two young men whose car
collided with a vehicle in President Vladimir Putin's motorcade,
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The two men underwent blood alcohol tests, said presidential
security spokesman Sergei Devyatov, according to the ITAR-Tass news
agency. He did not specify the results of the test.
</P>
<P>
   Devyatov said the two started chasing the motorcade around 10
p.m. Monday in a compact car and evaded a police car that tried to
stop them. Their path was then blocked by a sport-utility vehicle
belonging to Putin's escort, which turned over on its side.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's car was not involved in the collision, but members of
the presidential security detail suffered bruises, a presidential
spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   No one answered the telephones Tuesday evening at Devyatov's
office, the Moscow traffic police or the city's Interior Ministry
branch. A Kremlin spokesman said he had no information about the
detentions.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Makes Campaign Appearance  </HEADLINE>
By MISHA SAVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   DJERDAP, Yugoslavia (AP) -- President Slobodan Milosevic launched
his re-election campaign on a barren plateau above the Danube,
lauding the achievements of the Yugoslav people and accusing the
West of sabotaging the country's recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony inaugurating a section of power dam, across the
river from Romania, came less than two weeks before Sept. 24
presidential and parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe our people will best be able to differentiate
between our interests and those of others -- between our own heroes
and foreign traitors.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is our answer to violence and injustice, a proof of the
civilization superiority of our nation, undefeated and unconquered
by evil,'' Milosevic said before he pressed the switch on the new
part of the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Cheering the speech were 10,000 flag-waving and cheering
supporters who had been bused to the ceremony, 110 miles southeast
of the capital, Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The independent Beta news agency quoted miners from the nearby
mining city of Bor as saying managers forced them to attend the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has kept mostly out of the public eye recently,
leaving the campaigning to his communist wife and coalition
partner, Mirjana Markovic, and close associates.
</P>
<P>
   But he has cracked down on opponents, arrested opposition
supporters and shut down independent media.
</P>
<P>
   Pollsters suggest that for the first time since Milosevic took
power a decade ago, he may be pushed into a runoff for the
country's top post. Observers suggest he may be forced to resort to
rigging the vote to win.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the growing challenge, Milosevic changed tactics
Tuesday. Instead of his customary fiery rhetoric, he delivered a
sedate speech to a population suffering from the impact of a decade
of wars and economic hardship.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic also sought to turn last year's NATO air war against
Yugoslavia into a moral victory -- even though it forced him to cede
Kosovo to the control of the international community.
</P>
<P>
   After the airstrikes ended in June 1999, Milosevic -- indicted by
a U.N. court for alleged war crimes against Kosovo's ethnic
Albanians -- became a virtual recluse, shunned by the West. On
Tuesday, he looked across the Danube to Romania and sounded
wistful.
</P>
<P>
   ''Across this river, in Romania, there is a nation with whom we
lived in traditional friendship throughout history, except for
minor historical problems with Romanian governments in the times of
(Soviet ruler Joseph) Stalin and when they received orders from
NATO,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want all nations in the Balkans to be free and firmly
convinced they can decide by themselves on their future and the
future of the Balkans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He blamed NATO for Yugoslavia's economic troubles, and described
reconstruction efforts as one of Yugoslavia's most outstanding
achievements.
</P>
<P>
   The new power facility was the last segment of Serbia's largest
hydroelectric plant on the Danube, shared jointly with Romania. The
entire complex took 36 years to build.
</P>
<P>
   The Djerdap plant -- Serbia's main source of electricity -- was
unharmed in NATO's 78-day bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A Belgrade-based independent group of analysts called G17 Plus
criticized Milosevic for the event, describing it as a ''pompous''
discovery of new ''sources of energy.'' They claimed that the part
of the power plant that the president opened Tuesday was years
overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thanks to a policy of wisdom and foresight ... we have waited
eight years,'' the group said. ''Let us hope that after the
elections we shall no longer witness similar successes.''

<HEADLINE> House Votes on Boy Scouts' Policy  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A small group of House lawmakers charging that
the Boy Scouts' policy toward gays was a badge of intolerance moved
Tuesday to repeal the organization's federal charter.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, heading for an evening vote, was another
challenge to the long-standing relationship between the Boy Scouts
and the federal government rising out of the group's stance on
excluding homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's chief sponsor, Rep. Lynn Woolsey, D-Calif., said she
was a Girl Scout and one of her sons was a Boy Scout. ''We're not
saying the Boy Scouts are bad; we're saying that intolerance is
bad,'' she said in introducing the measure earlier this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're disappointed that this bill would even be considered,''
countered Boy Scouts spokesman Gregg Shields. He said having a
federal charter is an honor and ''we hope to continue to live up to
that honor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boy Scouts of America got its federal charter in 1916, six
years after it was founded. It is one of about 90 groups with such
designation, an honorary title given to patriotic, charitable and
education organizations.
</P>
<P>
   While it confers no specific benefits, receiving a federal
charter is a mark of prestige and national recognition for a group.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision in June, upheld the Boy
Scouts' ban on homosexuals serving as troop leaders. That ruling
may also give legal backing to the 6.2 million-member
organization's rejection of gay youths as members.
</P>
<P>
   The Scouts asserted that homosexual conduct is inconsistent with
the values it seeks to instill.
</P>
<P>
   But while the high court sided with the group's First Amendment
rights to ''expressive association,'' the Boy Scout relationship
with the federal government was brought into question when
President Clinton, five days before the ruling, issued an executive
order barring discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in
federally conducted education and training programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Department in August asked the Justice Department
for guidance on how that order affected the holding of Boy Scout
Jamborees on federal lands.
</P>
<P>
   GOP presidential nominee George W. Bush and other Republicans
quickly accused the administration of trying to throw the scouts
off federal lands. But Attorney General Janet Reno, in a statement
this month, said the tradition of Boy Scouts using federal lands
for camping and other activities could continue.
</P>
<P>
   Woolsey has also urged Clinton to resign as honorary president
of the Boy Scouts because of the policy toward gays. Her office
said the White House has not responded to that request. Shields
said every president since Taft has served as honorary president.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill number is H.R. 4892.

<HEADLINE> ABC Crushes Competition for Week  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ABC crushed its competition last week with
its largest summertime audience in four years, thanks to the Emmy
Awards, the return of ''Monday Night Football'' and ''Who Wants to
Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   The network had the six most-watched programs in prime-time,
Nielsen Media Research said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Emmys proved a triumph for NBC shows like ''The
West Wing'' and ''Will &AMP; Grace,'' the ceremony brought more than 21
million viewers to ABC. It was the award show's biggest audience
since at least 1986, when Nielsen began using people meters for
more accurate measurements.
</P>
<P>
   Despite critical razzing, ''Big Brother'' on Wednesday was CBS'
most-watched program of the week. That was the night the six
remaining contestants each turned down $50,000 to leave the house.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's low-key summer has been dominated by lawyers. ''Law and
Order'' reruns continued their strong ratings performance, with two
editions televised last week standing as the network's two most
popular shows.
</P>
<P>
   For the week, ABC's 49 percent advantage over second-place CBS
was its biggest summer margin of victory since at least 1990. It
had an average of 12.3 million viewers (8.4 rating, 14 share).
</P>
<P>
   CBS had 8.3 million viewers (5.9 rating, 10 share), NBC had 7.8
million viewers (5.7, 10), Fox had 7 million viewers (4.7, 8), UPN
had 3.8 million viewers (2.5, 4), the WB had 2.5 million (1.7, 3)
and Pax TV had 1.5 million (1.1, 2).
</P>
<P>
   NBC's ''Nightly News'' won the evening news ratings with 9.2
million viewers (6.9 rating, 15 share). ABC's ''World News
Tonight'' had 8.8 million viewers (6.6, 15), and the ''CBS Evening
News'' had 7.4 million (5.7, 13).
</P>
<P>
   A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of
the nation's estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show.
</P>
<P>
   For the week of Sept. 4-10, the top 10 shows, their networks and
ratings: ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Tuesday), ABC, 15.7;
''NFL Monday Night Football: Denver at St. Louis,'' ABC, 15.3;
''Emmy Awards,'' ABC, 14.2; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''
(Thursday), ABC, 13.5; ''NFL Monday Showcase,'' ABC, 12.7;
''Vanished,'' ABC, 9.1; Law and Order,'' NBC, 9.0; ''Dharma &AMP;
Greg,'' ABC, 8.3; ''Dateline NBC'' (Tuesday), NBC, 8.1; ''20/20
Downtown,'' ABC, 8.0; ''Law and Order'' (Monday), NBC, 8.0.

<HEADLINE> Albright Bashes Iraq in U.N. Speech  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- In a measured farewell speech to the
United Nations, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright urged
sometimes hesitant nations to ''stand up to the campaign launched
by Baghdad against the U.N.'s authority and international law.''
</P>
<P>
   After four years as U.S. ambassador to the world body, and now
nearing the end of four years as Secretary of State, Albright
called for a larger peacekeeping staff and said she was alarmed by
the deepening gap between rich and poor.
</P>
<P>
   She saluted U.N. programs that cut waste and said a new
inspector general's office was responsible for saving tens of
millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But balanced against the good news, Albright said Tuesday she
was grieved by the conflicts that still rage around the world and
widespread denial of basic rights and freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   Singling out repression in Burma, Albright said ''we must not be
silent.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Albright told the U.N. Millennium Assembly at the start
of a two-week debate that ''by working together, within and outside
this organization, we can move together, step by step toward the
lofty goals we have set. And thereby bring about a world more
peaceful, prosperous and free than it has ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   Her harshest remarks were reserved for Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein, for defying U.N. inspectors searching for weapons of mass
destruction. She said Iraq's strategy was to ignore its obligations
as a U.N. member ''and seek to preserve at all costs its capacity
to produce the deadliest weapons humanity has ever know.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, at a news conference, she vigorously dismissed as ''Alice
in Wonderland'' contentions by religious groups and others that
U.S.-engineered sanctions were starving the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said Iraq was pumping all the oil it could and that the
revenue provided ''caloric intake'' for Iraqi children that was
higher than before the 1991 Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   Denouncing Saddam as ''the real villain,'' Albright said he''can
pick up the key to let him out of sanctions'' by admitting the
inspection group headed by diplomat Hans Blix.
</P>
<P>
   Albright did not directly threaten an attack on Iraq if it did
not submit, but she said ''we have our red lines; we have made that
clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright's connection to the United Nations goes back to her
childhood, when her father, Czech diplomat Josef Korbel, was
assigned here. ''I have always considered myself a child of the
U.N.,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In her four years as ambassador she championed an activist
approach by the world body, and then, as Secretary of State, pushed
for holding perpetrators of ethnic cleansing in the Balkans and
Rwanda accountable.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, she took a hard line against Baghdad, and labored to
rally sometimes hesitant nations, including ally France and also
Russia, to join the United States and Britain against the regime.
</P>
<P>
   ''When international norms are assaulted,'' she said, ''the U.N.
must do more than simply observe injustice, or report upon it, or
sympathize with the victims. We must do all we can where we can to
stop the perpetrators.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 34; Nasdaq Adds 37  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors' renewed enthusiasm for technology
issues helped push the stock market higher Tuesday after two
straight sessions of losses due to uncertainty about third-quarter
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 34.04 at 11,229.53.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index was up 36.85 at 3,933.20 and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 3.43 at 1,494.69. Both fell
Friday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the market volatility reflected the uncertainty of
many investors heading into third-quarter corporate earnings
season.
</P>
<P>
   With more data suggesting economic growth is slowing, the chance
of another interest rate hike this year by the Federal Reserve is
fading. But investors remain unsure of what the slowdown will do to
corporate earnings reports and don't know where to put their money,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can understand why the market would be concerned about
earnings but I think it's misplaced,'' said Kevin Caron, an
associate strategist with Gruntal &AMP; Co. ''By the end of the year,
you'll see a growth rate of about 4 percent .... What we're seeing
is a return to a more normal rate of growth that is clearly
sustainable.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech stocks moved up Tuesday while energy issues moved down, a
reversal of trading Monday, when tech pushed the Dow, Nasdaq and
S&AMP;P down and energy stocks surged.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Sun Microsystems rose $3.13 to $118.38, after dropping
more than $4 on Monday. IBM stock was up $2.25 at $126.88.
</P>
<P>
   But energy related stocks were down. Schlumberger fell $1.94 to
$83.31; Baker Hughes was down 75 cents at $38; and Halliburton fell
42 cents to $53.81.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, investors traded Pier 1 up 88 cents to $12.31
after the home furnishing store reported earnings per share ahead
of analysts estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Best Buy were up $4.38 at $68.81 after the consumer
electronics retailer beat Wall Street estimates for second-quarter
earnings and said it expects same-store sales to increase between 4
percent and 6 percent in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues narrowly outnumbered advancers on the New York
Stock Exchange. Volume came to 663.08 million shares, compared with
603.38 million in the last session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 1.85 at 535.47.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Losing your parents, giving up your children: Are any emotions
more raw than these?
</P>
<P>
   Not for kids. Not for parents.
</P>
<P>
   And not for the 10,000 children -- Jewish and others -- who were
bundled off on trains from Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia to
foster homes in Britain in an extraordinary rescue operation during
the months immediately before World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Their story -- one of heartbreak, loneliness, fear and guilt -- is
told in ''Into the Arms of Strangers: Stories of the
Kindertransport,'' a documentary produced by Deborah Oppenheimer,
whose mother was one of those saved by a ''Kinder'' train.
</P>
<P>
   The experience was so searing that Oppenheimer said her mother,
Sylva Avramovici Oppenheimer, would not discuss the subject. It was
only after her mother's death -- and the discovery of letters
written to her mother in England by her grandparents, who died in
the Holocaust -- that Oppenheimer began her quest.
</P>
<P>
   Skillfully mixing old film footage with survivors' photos and
interviews, ''Into the Arms of Strangers'' examines the wave of
anti-Semitism that accompanied the Nazis' rise to power, then
delves into the ache of the children's departures and the shock of
living with foster families in another country. Many of the
children never saw their parents again.
</P>
<P>
   ''I ceased to be a child when I boarded that train in Prague,''
said one survivor, Eva Hayman.
</P>
<P>
   ''The parting was terrible. That's the one thing I have never
forgotten,'' echoed Ursula Rosenfeld.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary's dramatic appeal ratchets up minute by minute,
for the audience knows what those in the film would only later find
out: The youngsters on the trains were saved from the Holocaust,
which eventually killed 1.5 million children.
</P>
<P>
   How you wish to shout out warnings to the innocents: Don't fight
with your parents on the last day! Hurry up and get those exit
papers! Don't give in to despair and pull your child out of the
train window!
</P>
<P>
   One parent did just that, and instead of being safe in England,
daughter Lory Cahn went on to endure a half-dozen concentration
camps before being liberated at Bergen Belsen.
</P>
<P>
   Visually, the documentary is enthralling, especially in its
contrasts. Well-dressed Jewish children play happily in parks in
1938, while in other scenes Hitler youth groups swagger through the
streets, chilling in their pressed uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   The turning point is Kristallnacht -- Nov. 9, 1938, when Nazi
troops ransacked Jewish businesses and rounded up 30,000 Jewish
men. Little-known footage of burning synagogues, rows upon rows of
broken shop windows and anti-Semitic graffiti convey the rising
fear ahead of the first Kinder train's departure from Berlin on
Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The British host families varied in their generosity, but they
cared for these foster children for years during the deprivations
of war. In an ironic twist, their efforts often were not
appreciated, for the Kindertransport children were struggling with
their own private grief and shock.
</P>
<P>
   ''None of the foster parents with whom I stayed -- and there were
five of them-- could stand me for very long, but all of them had the
grace to take in a Jewish child,'' said Lore Segal.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to see this film is with your teen-ager. After two
intense hours revisiting the elemental bond between parent and
child, the grit of daily life washes away. You begin to think: Why
were we fighting about her getting a bellybutton ring? She is here,
by my side, and our life together is just what all the
Kindertransport parents and children so desperately missed.
</P>
<P>
   The Warner Bros. release was written and directed by Mark
Jonathan Harris, narrated by Dame Judi Dench. It was produced in
cooperation with the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in
Washington, D.C., which plans a related exhibit of Kindertransport
photos and artifacts this fall. The movie is not yet rated. Running
time: 117 minutes.

<HEADLINE> At The Movies: 'Duets'  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTY LEMIRE
For The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's get this out of the way, right off the top, to avoid
speculation: Gwyneth Paltrow actually can sing.
</P>
<P>
   She and Huey Lewis (without The News) have some nice harmonies
when they perform Smokey Robinson's ''Cruisin''' during a karaoke
contest in ''Duets.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, that scene is one of the few bright spots in this
flat, unfocused film, and it doesn't come until nearly the end.
</P>
<P>
   ''Duets'' follows several lost souls across the country who find
empowerment, redemption, freedom, you name it, when they sing
onstage at karaoke bars. It's actually an intriguing subculture of
society. A documentary about real people who perform on the karaoke
circuit -- who live for the thrill of being a star for a few minutes
-- would have been more interesting. Instead, we have a bunch of
actors singing with varying degrees of success, playing
two-dimensional characters headed toward the Grand Prize Karaoke
Contest in Omaha, Neb.
</P>
<P>
   Paltrow plays Liv, a Las Vegas showgirl. When her mother dies,
the father she never knew shows up to pay his respects and guess
what, it's Lewis as a guy named Ricky Dean, who hustles his singing
skills like a pool shark at karaoke bars.
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe Lewis is old enough to play her father, but he looks
nothing like Paltrow. And when each of them realizes they are
related, their reunion is neither tearful nor angry. Both actors
just look confused, like two students in a drama-class
improvisation session who can't figure out what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   Then we have Todd (Paul Giamatti), a downtrodden traveling
salesman who has grown tired of his middle-class, tract-house
existence. One day, he gets in his car and drives aimlessly. And at
a hotel bar, he discovers the magic of karaoke and is reborn.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he picks up a hitchhiker named Reggie (Andre Braugher),
an escaped convict with ''the voice of an angel,'' the film's
production notes say. They also perform a duet (hence the title) of
''Try a Little Tenderness.''
</P>
<P>
   Our final pair is Billy (Scott Speedman from the WB television
series ''Felicity''), a cab driver who catches his wife cheating on
him with his business partner, and Suzi (Maria Bello of ''Coyote
Ugly''), a West Virginia waitress who dreams of stardom. He agrees
to drive her to the karaoke contest in his cab because he has
nowhere else to go. (These two don't perform a duet. Speedman says
he can't sing, although that didn't stop anyone else in this
movie.)
</P>
<P>
   There's no plot, really. We meander from one karaoke bar to the
next in great anticipation of The Big Contest (sort of like The Big
Game in sports movies).
</P>
<P>
   Pretty much every scene feels contrived, including a bar fight
where people break beer bottles over each other's heads and Paltrow
gets to throw a chair at someone.
</P>
<P>
   Todd and Reggie get into a gunfight with a convenience store
clerk in Kansas, which adds nothing to the story. But it's fun to
shoot at glass refrigerator doors and bags full of
carbohydrate-laden snacks.
</P>
<P>
   Paltrow's performance may be the most confusing part of all.
She's supposed to be a dingy blonde, but she walks and talks so
awkwardly, she could be a teen-ager going through puberty.
</P>
<P>
   This is troubling because:
</P>
<P>
   a) Gwyneth Paltrow has tremendous talent and presence.
</P>
<P>
   b) Her father Bruce Paltrow directed and co-produced ''Duets.''
Was he watching the same movie as the rest of us?
</P>
<P>
   There are too many characters, subplots and themes going on at
the same time, so it's hard to connect with any of them. Is the
movie an indictment of our homogenous, middle-class society? Is it
a buddy-road flick? Or is it just straight-up musical
entertainment? It tries to be all these things and succeeds at none
of them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Duets,'' a Hollywood Pictures release, is rated R for language
and some sexuality. Running time: 112 minutes.

<HEADLINE> At The Movies: Crime and Punishment  </HEADLINE>
By MATT CRENSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a title like ''Crime and Punishment in Suburbia,'' you
might expect something like this year's ''Hamlet,'' which starred
Ethan Hawke as a present-day patrician weathering the slings and
arrows of outrageous corporate fortune.
</P>
<P>
   But ''Crime and Punishment in Suburbia'' is no modern update of
Dostoevsky's Russian classic. It is an adolescent love story with a
murderous subplot. There are flashes of intelligence and
inspiration. But much like adolescence, the movie is mostly
tedious, awkward and pretentious.
</P>
<P>
   Screenwriter Larry Gross cleverly names his protagonist Rosanne
Skolnik, after Dostoevsky's Raskolnikov. Outwardly, Rosanne (Monica
Keena) lives a blissful life of cheerleader practices, pep rallies
and make-out sessions.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the doors at the Skolnik family McMansion, things are
falling apart. Rosanne's dissatisfied mom (Ellen Barkin) is
stepping out on stepfather Frank (Michael Ironside). Frank is
getting increasingly anti-social about it.
</P>
<P>
   Soon we meet mysterious neighbor Vincent (Vincent Kartheiser),
who obsessively photographs Rosanne and boyfriend Jimmy (James
DeBello) wherever they go. Thus the analogy to ''American Beauty,''
which cast Wes Bentley as the creepy next-door neighbor, is
complete.
</P>
<P>
   Except ''Crime and Punishment in Suburbia'' is no brilliant
depiction of American suburbia rotting from within. Slow-moving and
disturbing only for its heavy-handed sex and violence, it ambles
around for 98 minutes as only an indie-film can.
</P>
<P>
   In Dostoevsky's novel, Raskolnikov slays his victim in the first
few chapters. Here it seems like the murder is never going to
happen.
</P>
<P>
   At least the soundtrack is rockin'. The edgy alt-rock tunes come
courtesy of Wilco, Guided by Voices, Sleater-Kinney and more.
During one sequence the Pixies' ''Monkey Gone to Heaven,''
performed by the Sacramento, Calif., band Far, virtually transforms
a high-school pep rally into a sinister pagan rite.
</P>
<P>
   Other brief highlights come when evil stepfather Ironside makes
the scene. He's a splendid low-rent Jack Nicholson, menacing and
consumed by impotent rage.
</P>
<P>
   DeBello also hits a groove as Rosanne's boyfriend Jimmy. When he
can't understand what's going on, he scrunches up his face so
dimwittedly, you can almost hear the gears grinding in his head.
</P>
<P>
   As Vincent, Kartheiser narrates the action in an intrusive
voice-over reminiscent of the one Christina Ricci provided in ''The
Opposite of Sex.'' He serves as a Christ figure bent on turning
Rosanne to the path of virtue. And in case you didn't get it, in
one of the final scenes, he appears wearing a T-shirt bearing the
image of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   With its limited release schedule, it may be hard to catch
''Crime and Punishment in Suburbia'' in theaters. Not to worry. It
should hit video stores by Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   ''Crime and Punishment in Suburbia,'' a United Artists release,
is rated R. Running time: 98 minutes.

<HEADLINE> Thai Police Charge Brit With Murder  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHIANG MAI, Thailand (AP) -- Thai police on Tuesday arrested a
British man on charges of rape and conspiracy to murder in the
death of a Welsh woman in a tourist resort in northern Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest of Andrew Gill, co-owner of a guesthouse where the
victim had stayed, culminated a monthlong investigation that had
been criticized as too slow, inaccurate and erratic.
</P>
<P>
   Police Maj. Gen. Aram Chanphen told reporters that witness
accounts and scientific tests pointed at Gill as the killer of
Kirsty Jones, 23.
</P>
<P>
   Gill, 32, a native of Northern Ireland, denied the charge and
has requested a lawyer, Aram said.
</P>
<P>
   Gill, under police detention on a charge of overstaying his
visa, was arrested Tuesday on charges of conspiracy to murder. If
convicted, he faces the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' partly naked body was found Aug. 10 in her room at the
Aree Guesthouse in Chiang Mai, 422 miles north of the capital,
Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they are looking for an accomplice but did not give
his name or his nationality.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no mystery in the case any more,'' Aram said.
</P>
<P>
   During the investigation, police took the DNA samples of Gill
and nine other foreigners who were staying in the guesthouse. DNA
samples of four Thais were also taken.
</P>
<P>
   Gill was apparently the last person to have been seen with Jones
on the night before her body was found. That night, guests heard a
struggle and a scream from Jones' room, but no one interfered,
thinking it was a lovers' quarrel.

<HEADLINE> Russian Troops Block Power Shutoff  </HEADLINE>
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Under intense pressure to collect unpaid bills, a
Russian electrical utility cut off power to a strategic missile
base -- which retaliated by sending troops to seize a switching
station and turn the lights back on.
</P>
<P>
   The drastic moves were a symptom of Russia's chronic web of
nonpayment, in which large companies and government agencies don't
pay cash for energy, raw materials and taxes -- a habit that
economists say drags down the economy.
</P>
<P>
   A local branch of the national electricity utility, Unified
Energy Systems, cut power Monday to a Strategic Rocket Forces base
about 60 miles northeast of Moscow, saying it owed about $683,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have been pushing them for one year to pay for the energy
on time, with no result,'' Yuri Kozlov, the head of the Teikovo
power grid, said on RTR government television.
</P>
<P>
   The military responded quickly, capturing a switching station.
''We have orders not to let any operator switch off the power,''
said Lt. Sergei Nikiforov, who commanded the platoon that occupied
the station.
</P>
<P>
   The military later agreed to talks on settling debts and
recalled the soldiers, and the utility agreed to keep the power on,
according to a power company statement.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which controls most of Russia's power grid, is a
key link in a vast chain of barter, offsets and in-kind payments
that economists say creates hidden subsidies that keep Soviet-era
industrial dinosaurs alive for political reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Dmitry Korshunov, the power company's spokesman in Moscow, told
The Associated Press the cutoff had only affected non-combat units
at the base, ''and only after repeated warnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Institutions subjected to blackouts for unpaid bills in recent
years have at times included hospitals, an air traffic control
center, coal mines and a city sewage plant. In 1995, sailors at an
Arctic submarine base forced engineers to turn the power back on at
gunpoint after a cutoff threatened to disrupt the cooling system on
a submarine's nuclear reactor.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov assailed this week's cutoff,
saying it was ''impermissible'' since military bases were on a list
of institutions that could not be cut off.
</P>
<P>
   The electricity utility, headed by the government's former chief
economic policy-maker, Anatoly Chubais, has been trying to collect
unpaid bills, in part because it is facing pressure from natural
gas giant Gazprom to pay its own bill for the gas it uses.
</P>
<P>
   Korshunov said the utility would continue pushing all customers,
including the military, to pay. ''We will act in a very tough
manner,'' he said. ''If we don't collect debts, we will have no
money to buy fuel during the winter.''

<HEADLINE> Podesta To Appear in E-Mail Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- White House chief of staff John Podesta was
ordered Tuesday to testify in a case involving thousands of lost
Clinton administrations e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth, who is overseeing the
production of the messages, ordered that Podesta appear in the
case, brought by the conservative legal organization Judicial
Watch.
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth has been holding evidentiary hearings for several
weeks. Because of a computer glitch, thousands of incoming e-mail
messages were not properly archived from September 1996 to November
1998. As a result, the messages were never reviewed by White House
lawyers to determine whether they should be turned over under
subpoena to investigators in cases ranging from the Monica Lewinsky
scandal and Whitewater to campaign fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   Under a court order, technicians are now trying to restore the
messages from computer backup tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Judicial Watch contends that the White House knew the scope of
the problem as early as June 1998, but dragged its feet on
producing the e-mails. White House witnesses have said a
''disconnect'' between lawyers and technicians left the legal staff
unaware of the matter's severity.
</P>
<P>
   Former deputy White House counsel Cheryl Mills testified earlier
this month that she did not speak with President Clinton or senior
aides about the glitch. Mills said she also could not recall
talking with Podesta about the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The judge on Tuesday also ordered testimony by Virginia Apuzzo,
the former assistant to the president for management and
administration.
</P>
<P>
   No dates were set for the appearances.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Charles Schumer Hurts Ankle  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Sen. Charles Schumer's misstep during a recent
Colorado vacation may keep him on crutches for awhile.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer tore several ligaments in his ankle when he stumbled
three feet off the platform of the cabin in Aspen where he and his
family were staying in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard my ankle go pop,'' Schumer said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Democrat is undergoing physical therapy and is
wearing a soft cast during the day. He was in a wheelchair for a
brief time.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I actually walked on it today and it's feeling much
better,'' Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   The accident came at the end of a cross-country trip with his
family that included hiking in the South Dakota Badlands and a trip
to Mount Rushmore. Schumer and his family arrived in Aspen late at
night and he fell while searching for the cabin's key in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   It's Schumer's second tumble in recent weeks. At the Democratic
Convention in Los Angeles, Schumer rode his bike into a car. He was
left with bruises on his shin and a slight limp.
</P>
<P>
   ''It hasn't been a good month,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> GOP Aiming To Renew Medical Savings  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Republicans will attempt to
expand and make permanent a law creating limited medical savings
accounts, which allow people to make tax-deductible contributions
for health costs.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, said Tuesday the provisions would be a key GOP
negotiating point as Congress and the White House attempt to reach
accord on a bill granting people new rights in dealing with health
maintenance organizations, including a possible right to sue.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Congress and the Clinton administration agreed to allow
medical savings accounts (MSAs) on a four-year test basis that
expires at the end of this year. Enrollment was capped at 750,000,
but as of 1998 only about 54,200 people had opened the accounts,
according to the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   Archer, R-Texas, estimated enrollment at closer to 100,000, but
said people were deterred because of high insurance deductibles and
restrictions that prevented larger companies from offering MSAs to
their employees. If expanded, Archer said the law could bring
health insurance to more of the estimated 44 million Americans with
no coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now is the time to open this up to all Americans,'' Archer
told reporters. ''If we take off the restrictions that were put on
the program ... all of this would change.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal by Archer, costing about $4.6 billion over 10
years, would make the law permanent, lift the 750,000 enrollment
cap and allow both employees and employers to contribute. It would
lower the minimum insurance deductible amount from $1,500 to $1,000
for an individual and from $3,000 to $2,000 for a family.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said they would oppose the changes. Rep. Charles
Rangel of New York, senior Democrat on the Ways and Means
Committee, said MSAs mostly appeal to ''younger, wealthier and
healthier people, leaving those less healthy and older to pay
higher premiums for traditional coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this summer, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said in
a letter to Rangel he would recommend that Clinton veto earlier
bills containing similar MSA expansions. But Archer said the GOP
would insist on the provision and could attach it to other popular
measures, such as a $1 increase in the $5.15-an-hour minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no justifiable reason to deny people this option,''
Archer said.

<HEADLINE> Kohl, Gorbachev Mark United Germany  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN GRAHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Former Chancellor Helmut Kohl, whose reputation as
a statesman for achieving German reunification has been sullied in
a party-funding scandal, got a rare public show of support Tuesday:
a warm handshake from one-time Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev, who negotiated the peaceful end of the post-war
division of Europe with Kohl and others a decade ago, reached out
to the former German leader before speaking at an event marking the
10th anniversary of a historic agreement paving the way for German
reunification. It was signed by the two German states and the four
World War II victors.
</P>
<P>
   The former Soviet leader lauded the courage and foresight of
Kohl and his former foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, in
pushing for swift reunification while also working to ease Soviet
fears that a united Germany could pose a new threat.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kohl and Genscher understood our concerns from the
beginning,'' Gorbachev told a gathering of politicians and
diplomats in a Berlin theater, adding that Kohl deserved respect
for his role in ending the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The former chancellor has embarked on a modest return to public
life, defying pressure to stay out of the limelight until he
provides the names of donors in a slush-fund scandal dogging the
Christian Democratic Union party he led for a quarter-century,
including 16 years as chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl eased back into the political fold on Monday, attending a
meeting of party lawmakers for the first time since setting off the
scandal last fall by admitting he accepted about $1 million in
off-the-books donations to party funds.
</P>
<P>
   Hauled before a parliamentary panel probing the affair, Kohl has

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Drops 25; Dow Falls 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue chip and technology stocks gave up early
gains and drifted lower Tuesday amid investors' continuing
uneasiness about third-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 2.22 at 11,193.27.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index fell 25.09 to 3,871.06 and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 4.98 at 1,484.28. Both fell
Friday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the market volatility reflected the uncertainty of
many investors heading into third-quarter corporate earnings
season.
</P>
<P>
   With more data suggesting economic growth is slowing, the chance
of another interest rate hike this year by the Federal Reserve is
fading. But investors remain unsure of what the slowdown will do to
corporate earnings reports and don't know where to put their money,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can understand why the market would be concerned about
earnings but I think it's misplaced,'' said Kevin Caron, an
associate strategist with Gruntal &AMP; Co. ''By the end of the year,
you'll see a growth rate of about 4 percent ... What we're seeing
is a return to a more normal rate of growth that is clearly
sustainable.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech stocks moved up Tuesday while energy issues were generally
lower -- a reversal of trading Monday, when tech pushed the Dow,
Nasdaq and S&AMP;P down and energy stocks surged -- but the gains didn't
last.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Sun Microsystems fell $1.38 to $113.88 after trading
at more than $118 earlier in the day. IBM stock was up 94 cents at
$125.56.
</P>
<P>
   Oil services provider Schlumberger fell $1.19 to $84.06; Baker
Hughes was down 44 cents at $38.31; and Halliburton was up 2 cents
at $54.25.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, investors traded Pier 1 up 94 cents to $12.38
after the home furnishing store reported earnings per share ahead
of analysts estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Best Buy were up $3.44 at $67.88 after the consumer
electronics retailer beat Wall Street estimates for second-quarter
earnings and said it expects same-store sales to increase between 4
percent and 6 percent in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues narrowly outnumbered advancers on the New York
Stock Exchange. Volume came to 775.21 million shares, compared with
714.25 million in the last session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 0.42 at 533.20.

<HEADLINE> Chelsea Clinton Leaves for Olympics  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton gave his daughter Chelsea a
lift to the airport in his limousine Tuesday and sent her off with
a hug as she headed for Australia as a member of the official U.S.
delegation to the Olympic games in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   It was the latest in a string of increasingly visible
assignments for Chelsea, 20, taking a semester off from Stanford
University where she is a senior. In Sydney she will be one of 10
members of the U.S. delegation led by Health and Human Services
Secretary Donna Shalala.
</P>
<P>
   Over the summer, Chelsea accompanied her father on trips,
including two last month that took her to Nigeria, Tanzania, Egypt
and Colombia. Last week in New York, she helped her father host a
reception at the Metropolitan Museum of Art for world leaders
attending the U.N. Millennium Summit.
</P>
<P>
   After dropping off Chelsea, the president hung around Andrews
Air Force Base to play 18 holes of golf with deputy chief of staff
Steve Ricchetti and press secretary Joe Lockhart, who is leaving
his job in a couple of weeks. ''Lockhart's taking the day off,''
the president told reporters. ''It should be a major story.''

<HEADLINE> Post Office Announces New Services  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Postal Service is going bilingual on the
Internet and resurrecting a once popular way to pay small bills --
postage stamps.
</P>
<P>
   The two were among a series of new services, mostly aimed at
business, the Postal Service announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   USPS Micropayment revives a practice of using stamps to make
small payments. It had been discouraged in recent years by
businesses that primarily use metered mail and did not want to deal
with large numbers of stamps.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new plan, companies would give potential customers a
return card to order merchandise, trial subscriptions or other
products. The card would include space for the buyer to stick
stamps totaling the correct price.
</P>
<P>
   The business would then simply turn in the stamped cards for
cash from the post office, eliminating the need to handle large
numbers of small checks or credit card payments.
</P>
<P>
   ''Reaching in a drawer and taking out a half-dozen stamps is a
lot easier than writing a check or using a credit card,'' commented
postal vice president John Ward. And some companies have had
problems with kids using credit cards, he added.
</P>
<P>
   In tests this summer a company called Fans UNITED gave out the
cards at rock concerts. Customers placed stamps on the cards to pay
for a brochure of photos available for sale.
</P>
<P>
   The response rate was 22 percent higher than asking people to
send in payments in an envelope, said Guido Karp, president of Fans
UNITED. If the fan made a purchase, Karp said, the price of the
brochure was refunded.
</P>
<P>
   The post office also said it is launching a new Spanish-language
Internet site -- www.usps.com/correo -- to serve that rapidly growing
segment of the U.S. population. Correo means post office in
Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to expand the reach and capability of our Web site for
all Americans,'' said Deputy Postmaster General John Nolan.
</P>
<P>
   The site will include postal news and information on package
services, special services and money-transfer services. The site
features a frequently asked questions section and an online
consumer survey to give feedback to the Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said it is testing Friend-to-Friend mail, a system to
combine an advertising message and a personal note.
</P>
<P>
   In this system a business gives out post cards with a postal bar
code -- like business reply mail -- covering the postage cost. The
card has an advertising message for the company, but also provides
a space for the customer to write the address of a friend and send
a personal message like a regular post card.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Ward said, if someone visited a restaurant and
liked it a lot the restaurant could give them one of these cards
that to send to a friend or relative.
</P>
<P>
   The individual using the card doesn't have to pay postage, which
is charged to the business' account only if the card is used.
</P>
<P>
   Other new services include:
</P>
<P>
   --Netspeed News, an electronic-mail distribution system for small
publishers. It allows the publisher to do design, editing and
layout, then send the material electronically to printers located
near the subscribers, where the material is printed, bound and
mailed.
</P>
<P>
   --Confirm, which would allow large mailers to track the movement
of material they have sent out, to confirm delivery, and also to
track return mail.
</P>
<P>
   --USPSdirectmail.com, another new website, this one designed to
assist direct mail marketers.

<HEADLINE> Study Suggests Radiation and Drugs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Prostate cancer patients whose disease has not
spread fare significantly better if treated with a combination of
radiation and hormone-blocking drugs than with radiation alone, a
study suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Similar results were found in a previous study comparing the two
treatments in men with more advanced cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The latest study, led by a Harvard Medical School researcher and
published in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical
Association, involved 1,586 men whose cancer had not spread beyond
the prostate gland.
</P>
<P>
   The men were treated between 1989 and 1999 with either
traditional external beam radiation or radiation plus six months of
drugs that block production of male hormones that can stimulate
cancer growth.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers compared the two approaches by measuring levels
of a blood protein called prostate-specific antigen for years after
treatment. Elevated PSA levels can suggest the presence of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   There was no statistical difference among low-risk men, or those
who had slow-growing tumors and very low PSA levels at the outset.
</P>
<P>
   Intermediate-risk men and high-risk men who received both
treatments had a fivefold and nearly threefold reduction in risk
for unfavorable PSA levels five years after treatment,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ''While further research is needed, it appears that the one-two
punch of radiation therapy and androgen suppression therapy may be
a more effective treatment in the battle against both
advanced-stage and early-stage prostate cancer,'' said Dr. Anthony
V. D'Amico, who led the study.
</P>
<P>
   The American Cancer Society estimates that 180,400 men will be
diagnosed with prostate cancer and 31,900 will die of the disease
this year. It is the second-leading cause of death among U.S. men,
after lung cancer.

<HEADLINE> FDA: Chicken Pox Vaccine Looks Safe  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Three years of data on the chicken pox vaccine
since it first became available show it is generally a safe and
effective way to prevent a mostly annoying but potentially serious
childhood disease, the government says.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 6,574 problems linked to the vaccine that were reported
to the government between its approval in March 1995 and July 25,
1998, most were minor complications, such as rashes or pain at the
injection site, the Food and Drug Administration said.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA said that 14 deaths were reported during that three-year
period but that other causes may have played a role and that it is
not clear whether the vaccine was a culprit.
</P>
<P>
   The agency recommended further study but said the information
gathered so far ''confirms that most of the vaccine's adverse
effects are minor.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Parents and pediatricians should be reassured,'' said Dr.
Robert P. Wise, an FDA epidemiologist who led the study
</P>
<P>
   The report, published in Wednesday's Journal of the American
Medical Association, also said that about 1 in 10 vaccinated
children may still develop a mild form of the disease after
exposure to chicken pox.
</P>
<P>
   The itchy, blistery disease usually is mild in children but can
cause severe reactions in adults.
</P>
<P>
   Vaccine advocates cite data showing that chicken pox is linked
to about 100 deaths and 4,000 to 9,000 hospitalizations annually.
</P>
<P>
   According to the FDA, nearly 10 million doses of vaccine had
been sold through July 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that the vaccine
be given to all healthy children between 12 and 18 months who have
not had chicken pox. About 20 states require the vaccine for
children entering school. Recent data suggest about 40 percent of
U.S. parents with toddlers have not had their children vaccinated.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors recommend against the vaccine for fear it will wear
off by the time children reach adulthood, ultimately making them
vulnerable to a more serious form of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ram Yogev, an infectious-disease specialist at Children's
Memorial Hospital in Chicago, noted that in Japan, where the
vaccine has been available for more than 20 years, evidence
suggests that it provides at least 20 years of immunity.

<HEADLINE> Former Mint Employee Admits Theft  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A former employee of the U.S. Mint pleaded
guilty Tuesday to stealing defective coins and selling them for
$80,000.
</P>
<P>
   David D'Angelo, 45, faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in
prison, three years' probation and a $250,000 fine when he is
sentenced in October.
</P>
<P>
   D'Angelo admitted to stealing the pennies, nickels, dimes and
other coins from December 1998 until last March. He sold them over
the Internet and directly to collectors, who value the coins
because they are rare, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Mary Ann Donaghy said D'Angelo was
arrested March 21 when police caught him leaving the mint with
several coins. He was charged with stealing government property.
</P>
<P>
   Collectors and dealers have noticed some incorrectly stamped
coins coming out of the Philadelphia Mint in recent years,
including new Sacagawea dollar coins with a Washington quarter
stamped on one side.
</P>
<P>
   D'Angelo did not have any Sacagawea coins, prosecutors said.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Delay Independence  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN LAUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Sept. 13 was supposed to be Palestinian
independence day.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a deadline for establishing a state was missed for the
second time in 16 months, and Palestinian leaders desperately tried
to maintain some credibility by announcing gradual steps toward
statehood, including general elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is time to show our people that we are doing something,''
Marwan Barghouti, head of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah
movement, said Tuesday in the face of overwhelming skepticism by
the residents of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli-Palestinian peace treaty, which would have defined
the terms for Palestinian statehood, was originally due Wednesday,
but talks are deadlocked over control of Jerusalem holy sites.
Israel has warned the Palestinians against unilateral steps, and
over the weekend, the PLO's top policy-making body, the Central
Council, decided to postpone a statehood proclamation at least
until Nov. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat said Tuesday that the Palestinians delayed the
declaration for at least five weeks to show the United States -- the
talks' main sponsor -- and Israel good faith.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians wanted to ''avoid any accusation by both the
United States or Israel that we are abandoning the peace process,''
he said in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Palestinians said they will begin drafting a
constitution and making preparations for holding presidential,
parliamentary and municipal elections in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed Qureia, the speaker of the Palestinian parliament, called
on Egypt and Jordan to determine exact borders with the Palestinian
territories in a sign of recognition of growing independence.
</P>
<P>
   The missed Sept. 13 treaty deadline ''is an opportunity to begin
gradually establishing the Palestinian state on the ground. The
intention now is not to do everything at one time,'' said Fatah
leader Barghouti, contrasting the new approach with the other
possibility, a unilateral proclamation of independence.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a period of five golden weeks for the negotiations,
and after that, I think we should begin,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat is wary of a unilateral declaration because a state in
the disjointed territories he controls would not be viable. At the
same time, he has promised his people a state by the end of the
year. Gradual steps toward statehood could provide a way out of his
dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   Many Palestinians had been skeptical from the start about
prospects for reaching a peace treaty by Sept. 13. In seven years
of peace talks, both on interim accords and the final treaty, not a
single deadline was met.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank refugee camp Kalandia, north of Jerusalem,
residents said they didn't believe a unilateral proclamation of
independence offered a solution.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not ready,'' said Khalil Lafi, a 45-year-old carpenter
and father of six. ''We don't have clear borders and an airport and
a port, and we must establish state institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   The main sticking point in the negotiations is a 36-acre walled
compound in Jerusalem's Old City. It is known to Jews as the Temple
Mount, site of their biblical Temples, and to Muslims as Haram
as-Sharif, or Noble Sanctuary, marked by two mosques built on the
spot where Muslims believe that the Prophet Muhammad ascended to
heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian negotiator Yasser Abed Rabbo warned that Israeli
negotiators were ''playing with fire'' by making claims to the site
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has said is a cornerstone of
Jewish identity.
</P>
<P>
   Such a claim, Arafat said, was ''a dirty attempt to stab all
Muslims.''
</P>
<P>
   Abed Rabbo said the idea of Islamic, as opposed to Palestinian
sovereignty over the site has been raised, but that Arafat has not
committed himself one way or the other. Israeli officials have
dismissed the idea of Islamic sovereignty as a nonstarter.	   Israel's Channel
Two television said Tuesday that Barak was
ready to propose that the five permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council -- the United States, Russia, China, France and
Britain -- become sovereign on the Temple Mount. Barak's office
described the report as ''speculation not worthy of a response.''

<HEADLINE> Mexico Butterfly Reserve Is Damaged  </HEADLINE>
By MARK STEVENSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- When butterfly defender Homero Aridjis walked
the mountains of the Monarch reserve in southern Mexico in the
1970s, he found ''a blanket of green.'' The last time he went, some
tourists wore paper masks against dust rising from deforested land.
</P>
<P>
   A new study of aerial photographs taken over the last 29 years
shows damage or destruction of 44 percent of the fir forest that
serves as wintering grounds for the Monarch butterfly in its annual
migration from the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's impacting the Monarch now,'' said Lincoln Brower,
a zoologist and the foremost expert on the 3,000-mile migration
that takes successive generations of butterflies back to the same
wintering grounds each year.
</P>
<P>
   The cool shade of the forest -- in which the Monarchs drape
themselves by the millions like a spectacular orange-and-black
carpet -- is a necessary piece of their migratory puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   But it's being cut down piecemeal by local communities and big
logging companies.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're starting to see (butterfly) colonies breaking up
earlier'' and heading back north in March, potentially exposing
them to killing late frosts in the United States, Brower said.
</P>
<P>
   He also reports that when dusty, dry winds blow through thinning
forests, the butterflies are more likely to fly down to nearby
lowlands streams to drink -- thus wasting precious energy needed for
the trip back.
</P>
<P>
   Forestry expert Guillermo Castilleja, who worked on the study
carried out by Mexico's National Autonomous University and the
World Wildlife Fund, predicts that in 10 or 20 years, the fir
forest could be reduced to patches of trees separated by bare
ground. Brower said in 50 years there could be ''basically nothing
left.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The situation is much worse than we thought,'' Castilleja
said, explaining that the logging could eventually affect the
Monarch's delicate metabolic balancing act.
</P>
<P>
   The butterflies store fuel during the summer; after they reach
Mexico, there is no evidence that they eat anything.
</P>
<P>
   The reserve -- basically, a Canadian-type northern fir forest
that has survived since the Ice Age on a string of mountain tops in
the tropics -- serves the Monarchs as what Brower calls ''a blanket
and an umbrella'' against temperature extremes and dryness.
</P>
<P>
   Cold and rain can kill them; heat and dryness can use up their
energy reserves.
</P>
<P>
   For Aridjis, who grew up near the reserves in central Michoacan
state and who went on to become an early proponent of protecting
the forest, the problems are quintessentially Mexican: corruption,
lax law enforcement and vested interests.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is generalized problem, of social demands and a
population explosion,'' said Aridjis. Unlike U.S. parks which have
no permanent residents, about 60,000 people, including Masagua
Indians, live in the Monarch reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Those inhabitants fear losing income from logging -- but also
face land erosion, and the drying-up of wells due to deforestation.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's answer is to create the first-ever trust-fund in Mexico
for such a reserve, to guarantee local people a payment for each
tree they don't cut down. An anonymous donor has already offered,
through the World Wildlife Fund, to contribute $5 million but much
more is needed.
</P>
<P>
   The government also hopes to add a 100,000-acre buffer zone
around the current 40,000-acre reserve.
</P>
<P>
   So far, and despite a joint pledge by Mexico, the United States
and Canada to protect the Monarch, the forest has largely been left
to its fate, despite the fact the area was declared a nature
reserve in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ''In analyzing the photos, we saw that there wasn't much
difference between forests that were in the 'protected area' and
those that weren't,'' Castilleja said. ''The good thing is that the
fir is a fine species, and in 20 or 25 years we could start to see
it growing back.''

<HEADLINE> Congress Sets Sights on Ocean  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With decades of research and billions of
dollars spent on studying the heavens, it's time for Congress to
start setting its sights much lower -- into the oceans, that is.
</P>
<P>
   That's the message behind a House measure.
</P>
<P>
   ''We spend billions of dollars on the space program because it
fascinates us as a people,'' said Rep. Jim Greenwood, R-Pa., the
bill's sponsor. ''In comparison, we spend pennies on ocean
research. But our survival is completely dependent on the survival
of the oceans.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenwood said the ocean floor should be searched for plants and
animals with human lifesaving potential, saying cures for AIDS,
cancer, diabetes and other diseases may be found in the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which the Senate has not yet considered, would earmark
$1.5 million for the National Academy of Sciences to set up a panel
that would organize an international workshop on ocean exploration.
</P>
<P>
   Other interested countries would be asked to help pay for
research and exploration programs, Greenwood said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's definitely a huge, unmet potential in the oceans,''
said Morgan Gopnik, director of the Ocean Studies Board of the

Academy of Sciences. ''We haven't spent much time exploring the
ocean for scientific and pharmaceutical possibilities, but we

<P>
   In other business, the House passed by voice vote a bill that
would let the federal government continue monitoring state
fisheries to make sure they prevent overfishing. Last year, $7
million was appropriated to carry out these activities through the
Atlantic Coastal Fisheries Act. This bill, which heads to the
Senate, would spend $10 million a year from 2001 through 2005.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's one of the most successful pieces of environmental
legislation Congress ever passed,'' said John H. Dunnigan,
executive director of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries
Commission. ''It recognizes the authority of individual states, and
it holds them accountable for managing their fisheries.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 38; Nasdaq Falls 54  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue chip stocks drifted higher while technology
issues gave up early gains Tuesday amid investors' continuing
uneasiness about third-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 37.74 at 11,233.23,
according to preliminary calculations.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index fell 53.62 to 3,842.73 and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 6.79 at 1,482.47. Both indexes
fell on Friday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the market volatility reflected the uncertainty of
many investors heading into third-quarter corporate earnings
reporting season. Most big U.S. companies will be announcing their
results in early to mid-October.
</P>
<P>
   With more data suggesting economic growth is slowing, the chance
of another interest rate hike this year by the Federal Reserve is
fading. But investors remain unsure of what the slowdown will do to
corporate earnings reports.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can understand why the market would be concerned about
earnings but I think it's misplaced,'' said Kevin Caron, an
associate strategist with Gruntal &AMP; Co. ''By the end of the year,
you'll see a (profit) growth rate of about 4 percent ... What we're
seeing is a return to a more normal rate of growth that is clearly
sustainable.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech stocks moved up in early trading Tuesday while energy
issues were generally lower, a reversal of Monday's trading. But
the gains didn't last.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Sun Microsystems fell 94 cents to $114.31 after
trading at more than $118 earlier in the day. IBM stock was up 38
cents at $125.
</P>
<P>
   Oil services company Schlumberger fell 56 cents to $84.69; rival
Baker Hughes was down 13 cents at $38.63; and Halliburton was up 15
cents at $54.38.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of J.P. Morgan continued to climb, rising $16.06 to
$185.38, on news reports that it is in talks with Chase Manhattan.
Morgan has also been eyed as a possible takeover target for
Deutsche Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ''The overall theme that we're seeing here is very typical in
the early stages of an economic recovery,'' said Steven Goldman,
chief market strategist at Weeden &AMP; Co. ''You're seeing
homebuilders, financial stocks and utility shares up. ... It's a
bullish omen.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, investors traded Pier 1 up $1 to $12.44 after the
home furnishing store reported earnings per share ahead of analysts
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Best Buy were up $4.75 at $69.19 after the consumer
electronics retailer beat Wall Street estimates for second-quarter
earnings and said it expects same-store sales to increase between 4
percent and 6 percent in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 6-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange. Volume came to 974.42 million shares,
compared with 895.71 million in the last session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 1.35 at 532.27.

<HEADLINE> New Legislation Would Honor Slaves  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than 200 years after work began on the
nation's Capitol, Congress is considering legislation on how best
to honor the slaves who helped build the United States' seat of
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would authorize the speaker of the House and
president pro tempore of the Senate to establish a special task
force to study the history and contributions of slave laborers
towards building the Capitol. The task force would then recommend
an appropriate memorial to be displayed on Capitol grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to make this happen,'' said Rep. J.C. Watts,
R-Okla. and a sponsor of the legislation with Rep. John Lewis,
D-Ga. ''I think we can recognize that slaves helped to build. . .
the center of freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, congressional historians revealed that slaves did much
of the 18th and 19th century work constructing the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Slaves were the largest locally available labor pool in 1790
when Congress ordered a new capital to be carved out of two
slave-owning states, Virginia and Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   When the three commissioners in charge of construction started
building in 1792 they hired field hands from local small farmers
and planters.
</P>
<P>
   Local slaves were available to be rented from their owners
cheaply, an average of $55 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The owners supplied clothing and blankets. The city
commissioners made sleeping space available in a barracks and
provided food: cornmeal, pork or beef, and shad in season.
</P>
<P>
   Many white laborers worked under similar conditions and ate the
same food, but their employment was voluntary and they could keep
the money they earned.
</P>
<P>
   Local historian Bob Arnebeck, in his 1991 book, ''Through a
Fiery Trial, Building Washington, 1790-1800,'' wrote that as work
began, slaves served as axmen, cutting trees on Jenkins Hill on
which the new Capitol would stand. Some helped square logs needed
for construction. Others cleared trees and stumps from the new
streets laid out by city planner Pierre L'Enfant.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Israeli Arab Militants Uncovered  </HEADLINE>
By JACK KATZENELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Police have arrested 41 Israeli Arabs and three
Palestinians from the West Bank on suspicion of forming an
underground, illegal possession of arms, and conspiracy to attack
police and soldiers, Israeli police said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Of those arrested, 24 have been indicted, said Alik Ron, police
chief in northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Ron stressed that such cases are unusual among Israel's Arab
minority, who are mostly law-abiding. Although most Israeli Arabs
support the demand of the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip for an independent state, the vast majority have not engaged
in militant activity against the Israeli authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a long time since such serious nationalist activity with
such serious intentions has been uncovered,'' Ron said.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects are in two groups, both from the northern city of
Umm el-Fahm. One group of 12 is held responsible for torching the
homes and businesses of Umm el-Fahm Arabs accused of collaborating
with the police or the Shin Bet security service, and threatening
to kill them if they did not publicly confess, Ron told a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   This group produced homemade zip-guns and fired them for
practice, Ron said.
</P>
<P>
   The other group -- 29 Israeli Arabs and three Palestinians -- is
suspected of illegal trading in arms and unlawful association.
</P>
<P>
   All of the first group and twelve members of the second group
have been indicted in the Haifa District Court, Ron said.
</P>
<P>
   The second group was directly linked to a faction of the Israeli
Islamic Movement, Ron said, and he had recommended that a criminal
investigation be opened against an Arab member of parliament on
suspicion of incitement to violence.
</P>
<P>
   He refused to disclose the lawmaker's name, but police spokesman
Uzi Sandouri said it was Mohammed Barakeh, head of Hadash, the
former communist party.
</P>
<P>
   Barakeh said he was unaware of being a suspect and denied having
incited to violence. ''We have always been victims of police
violence, not agitators against the police,'' he told Israel
television.
</P>
<P>
   Ron accused Islamic Movement preachers of delivering
inflammatory sermons in the mosques of Israeli Arabs. Islamic
Movement Spokesman Hassan Abdel Rachman denied that the movement
encourages violence, whether political or of any other kind.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Islamic Movement is a legal organization and is not
responsible for the actions of any individual who breaks the law,''
he told Channel 2 television.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the first group is Uyad Jaberine, Ron said. He is
the son of Mohammed Jaberine, who is serving a life sentence, with
three other Israeli Arabs, for the 1992 murder of four Israeli
soldiers, who were hacked to death with knives and a pitchfork as
they slept in their tent.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia's Milosevic Campaigns  </HEADLINE>
By MISHA SAVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   DJERDAP, Yugoslavia (AP) -- President Slobodan Milosevic launched
his re-election campaign on a barren plateau above the Danube,
lauding the achievements of the Yugoslav people and accusing the
West of sabotaging the country's recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony inaugurating a section of power dam, across the
river from Romania, came less than two weeks before Sept. 24
presidential and parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe our people will best be able to differentiate
between our interests and those of others -- between our own heroes
and foreign traitors.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is our answer to violence and injustice, a proof of the
civilization superiority of our nation, undefeated and unconquered
by evil,'' Milosevic said before he pressed the switch on the new
part of the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Cheering the speech were 10,000 flag-waving and cheering
supporters who had been bused to the ceremony, 110 miles southeast
of the capital, Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The independent Beta news agency quoted miners from the nearby
mining city of Bor as saying managers forced them to attend the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally later Tuesday in the southern Serbian city of Nis,
the opposition leaders warned that Milosevic will try to rig the
elections and called on the citizens to ''defend'' an election
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''We already have a majority, we just need resolve to defend the
results,'' opposition leader Zoran Djindjic told some 10,000
people. ''There will be no haggling.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Hope is spreading throughout Serbia,'' Djindjic said. ''He
(Milosevic) is finished and he deserves nothing better.'' Serbia
and the smaller republic of Montenegro make up the Yugoslav
federation.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has kept mostly out of the public eye recently,
leaving the campaigning to his communist wife and coalition
partner, Mirjana Markovic, and close associates.
</P>
<P>
   But he has cracked down on opponents, arrested opposition
supporters and shut down independent media.
</P>
<P>
   Pollsters suggest that for the first time since Milosevic took
power a decade ago, he may be pushed into a runoff for the
country's top post. Observers suggest he may be forced to resort to
rigging the vote to win.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the growing challenge, Milosevic changed tactics
Tuesday. Instead of his customary fiery rhetoric, he delivered a
sedate speech to a population suffering from the impact of a decade
of wars and economic hardship.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic also sought to turn last year's NATO air war against
Yugoslavia into a moral victory -- even though it forced him to cede
Kosovo to the control of the international community.
</P>
<P>
   After the airstrikes ended in June 1999, Milosevic -- indicted by
a U.N. court for alleged war crimes against Kosovo's ethnic
Albanians -- became a virtual recluse, shunned by the West. On
Tuesday, he looked across the Danube to Romania and sounded
wistful.
</P>
<P>
   ''Across this river, in Romania, there is a nation with whom we
lived in traditional friendship throughout history, except for
minor historical problems with Romanian governments in the times of
(Soviet ruler Joseph) Stalin and when they received orders from
NATO,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want all nations in the Balkans to be free and firmly
convinced they can decide by themselves on their future and the
future of the Balkans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He blamed NATO for Yugoslavia's economic troubles, and described
reconstruction efforts as one of Yugoslavia's most outstanding
achievements.
</P>
<P>
   The new power facility was the last segment of Serbia's largest
hydroelectric plant on the Danube, shared jointly with Romania. The
entire complex took 36 years to build.
</P>
<P>
   The Djerdap plant -- Serbia's main source of electricity -- was
unharmed in NATO's 78-day bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A Belgrade-based independent group of analysts called G17 Plus
criticized Milosevic for the event, describing it as a ''pompous''
discovery of new ''sources of energy.'' They claimed that the part
of the power plant that the president opened Tuesday was years
overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thanks to a policy of wisdom and foresight ... we have waited
eight years,'' the group said. ''Let us hope that after the
elections we shall no longer witness similar successes.''

<HEADLINE> USDA: Civil Rights Dept. Inept  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hundreds of civil rights complaints have piled
up at the Agriculture Department because of the inept, disorganized
staff responsible for handling them, federal investigators said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The ''complaints system is in total disarray,'' USDA's inspector
general, Roger Viadero, told the Senate Agriculture Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Viadero, who completed an investigation of the department's
civil rights office in March, said files were poorly maintained,
complaints were not properly tracked and managers were not held
accountable for missing deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   James Robertson, who oversaw an investigation of the civil
rights office for the General Accounting Office, the investigative
arm of Congress, said it lacked qualified personnel. The office has
been widely viewed inside USDA as a ''dumping ground'' for the
department's disgruntled employees. he said.
</P>
<P>
   USDA officials said that they had taken steps both to process
complaints more quickly and to prevent discrimination against
employees and farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not here to tell you that our problems are fixed. We're
here to tell you that we take them seriously, and that we are doing
everything we can to fix them,'' said Paul Fiddick, the
department's assistant secretary for administration.
</P>
<P>
   USDA last year settled a lawsuit with black farmers who claimed
that the department had systematically discriminated against them
and now faces a similar lawsuit brought on behalf of American
Indian farmers. At the same time, the department also has 1,800
pending discrimination complaints brought by its own employees.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., said the department's civil rights
record ''is just abysmal and I hope we can get it resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Senate committee, Indiana Republican Richard
Lugar, said there was a lack of accountability in USDA ''from the
highest level of management to the county supervisor in the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of discrimination complaints filed by farmers and
other beneficiaries of USDA programs has fallen from 1,261 during
the 1999 budget year to a projected 650 for the 2000 budget year,
which ends Sept. 30, Fiddick said. However, about 450 of the
complaints filed last year are still pending.
</P>
<P>
   The number of complaints filed by the department's own employees
is about average for the federal government, Fiddick said.
</P>
<P>
   USDA, which has 100,000 workers, ranks fifth among major
departments in the rates at which its employees file discrimination
complaints, behind the Labor, Education, Housing and Urban
Development, and Transportation departments, he said.
</P>
<P>
   USDA receives about 835 such complaints a year and processes an
average of 744 annually.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, black farmers continue to complain that the
department hasn't fired employees responsible for discriminating
against them.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit itself ''appears to be another example of hollow
promises'' because of the number of farmers who have had their
claims denied, said John Boyd, a Virginia tobacco grower who is
president of the National Black Farmers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Some 22,000 farmers have filed claims. About 18,000 of those
have been processed and 11,000 have been approved. The claims are
reviewed by an independent company.

<HEADLINE> Report: US Govt. Wastes Billions  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ZUCKERBROD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A dozen of the largest federal agencies
reported squandering $20.7 billion last year, with improper
Medicare payments accounting for more than half of that money,
according to a General Accounting Office study released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's astounding that more than $20 billion of taxpayer money
was wasted by just a handful of federal programs, and that's just a
drop in the bucket,'' said Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., who ordered
the study by Congress' investigative branch.
</P>
<P>
   The improper payments were culled from the annual financial
reports of agencies that accounted for most of the government's
$1.7 trillion budget for fiscal 1999, according to the Office of
Management and Budget. The $20.7 billion represents 1.2 percent of
the total.
</P>
<P>
   ''These payments include things like providing federal benefits
to dead people or making duplicate payments to contractors. They
may be payments made by mistake or to people defrauding the
government,'' said Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO agreed with Thompson's assessment that the problem is
far more widespread than is reflected on the agencies' financial
statements.
</P>
<P>
   Agencies are not required to identify improper payments, and
several agencies reported losing money to improper payments but did
not identify how much they lost.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson introduced legislation Tuesday that would require
agencies to audit their payments using practices commonly found in
the private sector. Similar legislation introduced by Rep. Dan
Burton, R-Ind., already passed the House.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report shows that $13.5 billion out of a Medicare budget
of $171 billion was lost through improper payment of claims last
year.
</P>
<P>
   That is up from $12.6 billion in similar Medicare losses in
1998. But it is still an improvement over 1997 when improper
Medicare payments totaled $20.3 billion, according to the inspector
general's office at the Department of Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   HHS should be applauded for its dramatic turnaround, said OMB
executive associate director and controller Josh Gotbaum. He said
the agency initiated the changes on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Gotbaum said the Clinton administration plans to set guidelines
by the end of the year urging other agencies to devise systems for
tracking and halting improper payments.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Schatz, president of the Citizens Against Government
Waste watchdog group, said the issue deserves immediate and urgent
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ''Taxpayers really don't know everything about what's going on
with their money,'' Schatz said. ''... In a competitive situation
outside of government, if you continue to make improper payments
and overpayments, you wouldn't be in business very long.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the second consecutive year the GAO has studied the
issue. Last year's report showed nine federal agencies reported
losses of $19.1 billion in improper payments.

<HEADLINE> House Nears Trade Tax Breaks Bill  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite opposition from Europe, legislation
enacting new tax breaks for thousands of U.S. companies that make
or sell products abroad neared passage Tuesday in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by the Clinton administration, Congress is rushing to
pass the bill before an Oct. 1 deadline set by the World Trade
Organization, which upheld a European Union complaint that current
U.S. Foreign Sales Corporation tax rules amount to an illegal
export subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   The WTO set the deadline to give the United States time to
change the legislation without retaliatory tariffs from the EU. But
it is likely the EU will find this bill just as disagreeable.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have total bipartisan support and complete agreement with
the White House,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the
House Ways and Means Committee. ''It is extremely important that we
send a message to the Europeans that we're serious about this.''
</P>
<P>
   A final vote was postponed until Wednesday, but sponsors were
certain they had the votes to prevail.
</P>
<P>
   EU officials in August contended that the legislation was still
an illegal subsidy, but U.S. officials said they would press ahead
to meet the October deadline to avoid a trade war that could result
in European tariffs or trade sanctions against up to $40 billion in
U.S. exports. The Senate is expected to pass the bill in short
order.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we fail to act by then, we're going to hurt American
businesses and the workers who work for them, and we're going to
help the Europeans,'' said Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Created in 1984 to offset an EU tax rebate for its exporters,
the Foreign Sales Corporation program permits U.S. companies to
reduce income taxes by 15 percent through export subsidiaries set
up in offshore tax havens such as Barbados and the Virgin Islands.
Microsoft, Boeing and General Motors are only a few of the 6,000
companies, with 4.8 million workers, that get the $4.1 billion
annual tax break.
</P>
<P>
   The replacement legislation, costing the government roughly the
same amount each year, would set up new tax breaks that apply
equally to exports by U.S. companies and the products they make
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The WTO ruling against the previous rules centered on their
nature as special exceptions in tax law. Efforts to reach a
diplomatic solution failed.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats decried the bill as corporate welfare and
expressed dismay that it was brought to the House floor under rules
preventing any amendments.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it quacks like a subsidy and walks like a subsidy, it's
still a subsidy,'' said Rep. Fortney ''Pete'' Stark, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to House GOP leaders, Reps. Lloyd Doggett of Texas
and Henry Waxman of California said the current program amounts to
a $100 million tax break for tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Estimating that smoking causes 3.5 million deaths a year around
the world, the two legislators said ''American taxpayers should not
be partner in this export of death and disease, where the result is
more children around the globe smoking.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Admin. Expands Housing Plan  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID HO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a season of political disagreements, both
parties are pushing to help low-income families afford housing, a
problem worsened by the robust economy's tight rental market.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration announced Tuesday it will use an
additional $100 million a year to expand its Section 8 rental
assistance voucher program, which currently helps more than 1.4
million low-income households. Families in the program usually pay
about a third of their income toward rent with the rest subsidized
by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., says expanding the voucher program
is a positive step, but doesn't go far enough. He was proposing
that a $1 billion grant be given to state housing agencies to build
new homes for low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   Most families in the voucher program earn at or near the federal
poverty line, about $17,000 for a family of four. The vouchers are
distributed by local housing authorities, which typically have long
waiting lists for subsidized housing.
</P>
<P>
   Rising rents have forced some recipients to return their
vouchers because they can't find an apartment cheap enough to
qualify for the program -- the least expensive 40 percent of
apartments in a particular market are eligible for rental by
voucher recipients.
</P>
<P>
   The new administration policy, expected to go into effect in
December, expands the rent limit to the least expensive 50 percent
of apartments, making an additional 1.4 million units available,
according to estimates from the Department of Housing and Urban
Development.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, more than 450 communities in 39 metropolitan areas
will be eligible for the expanded program, including neighborhoods
in Atlanta, Chicago, Detroit, Miami and St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Other communities can qualify for the new expanded policy if
families have had problems finding affordable rental properties or
voucher-holders are highly concentrated in a limited number of
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said the change would help expand the supply
of affordable housing for the 5.4 million very-low income families
who pay more than half their incomes for housing or live in
severely inadequate apartments.
</P>
<P>
   ''More than 50 years ago the nation committed itself to the goal
of a decent home and a suitable living environment for every
American family,'' Clinton said in a statement. ''Today's action
brings us a step closer toward that goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration is using its executive authority to expand
the program rather than going through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Bond, who chairs the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on HUD,
was proposing legislation to increase the value of the vouchers
beyond the level of HUD's new policy and provide the $1 billion
grant to build new homes for low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   ''More and more vouchers are chasing less and less available
housing,'' Bond said in an interview. ''To say that we give out
more vouchers so we help more families is not necessarily true and
is becoming less true.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond said in some communities as many as half of the vouchers
distributed can't be used because housing isn't available and
nationwide 1 in 5 vouchers go unused.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of tenants across the country have lost their
subsidized HUD housing -- or risk losing it -- as landlords drop out
of Section 8 to seek higher rents on the open market.
</P>
<P>
   The expanded voucher program would be paid for this year by from
shifting money from the reserve funds of existing housing programs.
In the future, HUD will seek additional money from Congress to
cover the expansion.
</P>
<P>
   The Section 8 program currently costs about $15 billion,
including the vouchers and programs for other subsidized housing.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, the Clinton administration requested that $690
million be spent to an additional 120,000 vouchers for poor
households.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Wins in Mauritius Vote  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW ENGLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT LOUIS, Mauritius (AP) -- Mauritians poured into the streets
Tuesday to celebrate the landslide victory of the opposition
alliance -- a result that could give this multiracial island its
first non-Hindu prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   When electoral Commissioner Irsam Rahman announced that the
alliance had won 54 of the 62 seats in Parliament in Monday's
general election, shops in the capital, Port Louis, closed, and
thousands of people sped around in cars and on motorbikes on this
Indian Ocean island waving the purple and white banners of the
alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Many wore T-shirts bearing the alliance's slogan: ''We'll get
the country back on track.''
</P>
<P>
   The incumbent Labor Party-led coalition headed by Prime Minister
Navin Ramgoolam won six seats, and a tiny party from neighboring
Rodriques island won two seats.
</P>
<P>
   The winning alliance included the Mouvement Militant Mauricien,
or MMM, and the Mouvement Socialiste Mauricien, MSM.
</P>
<P>
   Alliance members had agreed in a pre-election pact that if they
won, MSM chief Sir Anerood Jugnauth, a Hindu, would serve as prime
minister for the first three years, then MMM leader Paul Berenger,
a Franco-Mauritian, would take for the next three, becoming the
nation's first non-Hindu leader since independence from Britain in
1968.
</P>
<P>
   Hindus from India make up 51 percent of the population of 1.1
million.
</P>
<P>
   The economy was a key issue in the opposition victory.
</P>
<P>
   Small businessman Mookaess Ramesser said people had voted for
the opposition because when Jugnauth was prime minister from
1982-95, $20 would buy vegetables for a week. Today, the same
amount buys only three days worth of vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Jugnauth told supporters that the alliance would bolster the
economy and create jobs, building the country up again so that even
the outside world would notice.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole theme of our campaign has been putting the country
back on its feet,'' Berenger told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to exports of sugar and textiles and income from upmarket
tourism, Mauritius is one of Africa's few economic and social
success stories. Annual income per capita is about $3,600 -- 10
times that of most nations on the African mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Before the elections, there was concern that the economy had
been wavering under Rangoolam. But the platforms of both his Labor
alliance and the opposition were nearly identical.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout averaged 80 percent of the 779,431 registered voters,
and no trouble was reported during the 12 hours of voting, Rahman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although 43 parties fielded 535 candidates, the contest was
always a straightforward fight between the Labor Party-led
coalition and the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Ramgoolam, son of the first leader of independent Mauritisu, the
late Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, was elected in 1995. His
government's five-year term was due to end in December, but he
dissolved Parliament and called early elections on Aug. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Uninhabited before Portuguese and Dutch settlers arrived in the
1500s with African slaves, Mauritius is a ''rainbow society'' of
Hindus, Muslims, Creoles, Africans, Chinese and Franco-Mauritians.

<HEADLINE> USDA Projects Higher Grain Prices  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dry, hot weather in August is cutting into
this fall's harvest in the parts of the South and Midwest but will
help provide a small boost to the prices farmers are paid for some
commodities, the government said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department said it expected soybean prices to
average about $4.75 this year, up 40 cents from its August
forecast, and 10 cents higher than last year's average.
</P>
<P>
   ''We may have finally hit the bottom and are starting on our way
up,'' USDA economist Larry Salathe said.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers are unlikely to see much of a difference; fluctuations
in the cost of raw ingredients and animal feed generally have
little effect on the price of processed food and meat.
</P>
<P>
   In its monthly survey of crop conditions, the department said
last month's heat and drought ''severely stressed pastures and
immature summer crops, including cotton, soybeans and sorghum.''
</P>
<P>
   The department lowered its forecast of the soybean crop to 2.9
billion bushels, 3 percent below the forecast a month ago, but that
would still be a record for the country and it is 10 percent larger
than last year's crop. Drought is expected to reduce yields in a
few states, including Nebraska and Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   USDA lowered its forecast of this year's cotton harvest by 4
percent to 18.3 million bales Tuesday. A bale is 480 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   USDA is barred by law from making official price projections for
cotton, but Salathe said the smaller harvest would likely raise the
price, currently about 62 cents a pound, by several cents.
</P>
<P>
   The department didn't make a significant change in its
projection of the corn harvest, which is expected to be a record
10.4 billion bushels. The department said, however, that the
average price of corn would rise 5 cents a bushel to about $1.70
because of higher demand for the crop and shrinking stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts were expecting the department's crop projections
to be smaller than they were, so grain and soybean prices declined
Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade after the report was
released.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for December delivery fell 4&AMP;frac34; cents to $2.60&AMP;frac34; a bushel;
December corn fell 2 cents to $1.94 a bushel; December oats fell 1
cent to $1.11&AMP;frac12; a bushel; November soybeans fell &AMP;frac12; cent to
$5.05&AMP;frac12; a
bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat farmers largely escaped any weather problems this summer,
and the USDA raised its projection of the crop to 2.3 billion
bushels, up 2 percent from last month's forecast. The increase in
wheat production has been offset by increased exports, so it is
unlikely to have much impact on the prices paid to farmers, USDA
said.

<HEADLINE> House To Vote on Boy Scouts' Policy  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A small group of House lawmakers charging that
the Boy Scouts' policy toward gays was a badge of intolerance moved
Tuesday to repeal the organization's federal charter.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation was another challenge to the long-standing
relationship between the Boy Scouts and the federal government
rising out of the group's stance on excluding homosexuals. A vote
on the bill, expected to be easily defeated, was likely to take
place Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's chief sponsor, Rep. Lynn Woolsey, D-Calif., said she
was a Girl Scout and one of her sons was a Boy Scout. ''We're not
saying the Boy Scouts are bad; we're saying that intolerance is
bad,'' she said in introducing the measure earlier this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're disappointed that this bill would even be considered,''
countered Boy Scouts spokesman Gregg Shields. He said having a
federal charter is an honor and ''we hope to continue to live up to
that honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were quick to condemn the bill and its Democratic
supporters. ''Election-year pandering on an issue so radical and
anti-American is an insult to families, Scouts and the country,''
said Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, the fourth-ranking House
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ''I scheduled this bill to demonstrate the lack of support for
those who have declared open season on the Boy Scouts,'' said House
Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Boy Scouts of America got its federal charter in 1916, six
years after it was founded. It is one of about 90 groups with such
designation, an honorary title given to patriotic, charitable and
education organizations.
</P>
<P>
   While it confers no specific benefits, receiving a federal
charter is a mark of prestige and national recognition for a group.
Among other groups with federal charters are the American Legion,
Future Farmers of America, the National Tropical Botanical Garden
and the National Ski Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision in June, upheld the Boy
Scouts' ban on homosexuals serving as troop leaders. That ruling
may also give legal backing to the 6.2 million-member
organization's rejection of gay youths as members.
</P>
<P>
   The Scouts asserted that homosexual conduct is inconsistent with
the values it seeks to instill.
</P>
<P>
   But while the high court sided with the group's First Amendment
rights to ''expressive association,'' the Boy Scout relationship
with the federal government was brought into question when
President Clinton, five days before the ruling, issued an executive
order barring discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in
federally conducted education and training programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Department in August asked the Justice Department
for guidance on how that order affected the holding of Boy Scout
Jamborees on federal lands.
</P>
<P>
   GOP presidential nominee George W. Bush and other Republicans
quickly accused the administration of trying to throw the scouts
off federal lands. But Attorney General Janet Reno, in a statement
this month, said the tradition of Boy Scouts using federal lands
for camping and other activities could continue.
</P>
<P>
   Woolsey has also urged Clinton to resign as honorary president
of the Boy Scouts because of the policy toward gays. Her office
said the White House has not responded to that request. Shields
said every president since Taft has served as honorary president.
</P>
<P>
   After the June Supreme Court ruling, Clinton said he is
''generally against discrimination against gays.'' But he refused
to criticize the Scouts or the court's ruling. ''The Boy Scouts
still are -- they're a great group. They do a lot of good.''
</P>

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 38; Nasdaq Falls 47  </HEADLINE>
By LISA SINGHANIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed Tuesday, with blue chips
drifting higher and technology issues giving up early gains, as
investors remained uneasy about third-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 37.74 at 11,233.23.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index fell 46.84 to 3,849.51 and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 7.27 at 1,481.99.
</P>
<P>
   The major indexes changed course several times during the day,
reflecting the uncertainty many investors feel in advance of
corporate earnings reports due to be released over the next six
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   With more data suggesting economic growth is slowing, the
likelihood of another interest rate hike this year by the Federal
Reserve is fading. But investors remain unsure of what the slowdown
will do to corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can understand why the market would be concerned about
earnings, but I think it's misplaced,'' said Kevin Caron, an
associate strategist with Gruntal &AMP; Co. ''By the end of the year,
you'll see a (profit) growth rate of about 4 percent ... What we're
seeing is a return to a more normal rate of growth that is clearly
sustainable.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech stocks moved up in early trading Tuesday while energy
issues were generally lower, a reversal of Monday's trading. But
the gains didn't last.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Sun Microsystems fell 94 cents to $114.31 after
trading at more than $118 earlier in the day. IBM stock was up 38
cents at $125.
</P>
<P>
   Oil services company Schlumberger fell 56 cents to $84.69; rival
Baker Hughes was down 13 cents at $38.63; and Halliburton was up 15
cents at $54.38.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of J.P. Morgan continued to climb, rising $16.13 to
$185.44, on news reports that it is in merger talks with Chase
Manhattan. Morgan has also been eyed as a possible takeover target
for Deutsche Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ''The overall theme that we're seeing here is very typical in
the early stages of an economic recovery,'' said Steven Goldman,
chief market strategist at Weeden &AMP; Co. He said the overall market
-- aside from the technology sector -- is still advancing.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies announced their earnings on Tuesday, and the
market followed its recent pattern of rewarding those with strong
results and outlooks, and punishing those who faltered.
</P>
<P>
   Best Buy was up $4.75 at $69.19 after the consumer electronics
retailer beat Wall Street estimates for second-quarter earnings and
said it expects sales from stores open at least a year to increase
between 4 percent and 6 percent in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But shares of PRI Automation plunged nearly 40 percent Tuesday,
falling $16.81 to $25.88, after the factory automation systems
maker said manufacturing problems would force its fourth-quarter
earnings to fall below expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 6-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange. Consolidated volume came to 1.20 billion
shares, ahead of the 1.10 billion shares in the last session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 1.19 at 532.43.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average dropped 0.56 percent.
Germany's DAX index was down 1.09 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell
0.40 percent, and France's CAC-40 rose 0.34 percent.

<HEADLINE> Disparity in Death Penalties Found  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Justice Department study found wide racial
and geographic disparities in the federal death penalty system, but
Attorney General Janet Reno blamed them on injustice in society
rather than bias in her department.
</P>
<P>
   Releasing the study Tuesday, Reno called for additional studies
and legislation but rejected renewed calls for a moratorium on
federal executions that poured in from Congress and civil rights
advocates in response to the figures.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said the data raised questions ''since we're
supposed to have a uniform law of the land.'' But he noted there
had been ''no suggestion, as far as I know, that any of the cases
where the convictions occurred were wrongly decided'' and said he
would consult Reno before deciding what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point we are troubled by the figures, but we have not
found the bias,'' Reno told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''Minorities are over-represented in the federal death penalty
system, as both victims and defendants, relative to the general
population,'' Reno said. ''Crime is often the product of social
ills and harsh conditions, such as poverty, drug abuse and lack of
opportunity, that disproportionately affect minorities. So long as
those conditions remain, we will continue to see disparities in the
number of minorities in the criminal justice system.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder, the study's author and the
nation's highest ranking black law enforcement officer, also saw no
need for a moratorium such as the one imposed in Illinois in
January by Gov. George Ryan, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan was reacting to a period when more Illinois inmates had
their death sentences overturned than were executed, Holder said.
''That is not the case here in the federal system. The number of
cases where we have actual claims of factual innocence are less
than 1 percent.'' Those claims can be dealt with adequately through
new presidential clemency procedures, Reno and Holder said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., renewed the demand that he
and five other members of Congress made in June that Clinton
postpone executions until a commission can study the issue. ''All
Americans agree that whether you die for committing a federal crime
should not depend arbitrarily on where you live.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., D-Ill., called for a moratorium rather
than ''business as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're an African American in Texas who commits a crime
that could warrant the federal death penalty, you get it. If you're
white in New York City, you probably don't. ... What is this, some
form of natural selection? Death penalty Darwinism?''
</P>
<P>
   Reno imposed a new system in 1995 requiring U.S. attorneys to
get her approval for all death sentences after senior Justice
officials reviewed each case. Neither she nor members of the review
team are told the race of defendants, but defense attorneys
sometimes tell them while arguing against the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's goal was to achieve a more uniform system, but the report
found the system was not uniform during its first five years.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers did show, however, that Justice Department
recommendations for death sentences in federal cases roughly
reflected the racial percentages of defendants charged with capital
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1995 and July of this year, U.S. attorneys forwarded for
review the cases of 682 defendants who faced capital charges, of
which 20 percent were white and 80 percent were minorities. U.S.
attorneys recommended the death penalty be sought for 183 of them,
26 percent of them whites and 74 percent minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Reno approved seeking death penalties for 159 of them, of which
28 percent were for whites and 72 percent for minorities. All
involved murders.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately during this period, 20 defendants were sentenced to
death, of which 20 percent were white and 80 percent minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Geographically, only nine of the 94 U.S. attorney districts
accounted for about 43 percent of the 183 defendants that
prosecutors recommended for the death penalty. They were Puerto
Rico, the eastern district of Virginia, Maryland, the eastern and
southern districts of New York, western Missouri, New Mexico,
western Tennessee and northern Texas.
</P>
<P>
   And a total of 40 districts never recommended a death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Although back on the books since 1988, the federal death penalty
has not been carried out since 1963 because of appeals.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the resumed federal death penalties is set for Dec.
12. In August, President Clinton delayed that execution so the
defendant, convicted killer Juan Raul Garza, could use new
procedures to appeal for clemency.

assassinated a leftist community activist who was planning a run
for local office in Colombia, police said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The body of Carlos Restrepo was found in a barren lot outside
San Luis, hours after armed men dragged him out of a community
meeting Saturday in the small town, 78 miles west of the capital,
Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   Restrepo, 44, had been shot several times in the head.
</P>
<P>
   The assailants, who arrived in a group of about 20, identified
themselves as members of the nationwide paramilitary umbrella
group, United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, police in the state
capital, Ibague, told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Pamphlets found next to Restrepo's body Saturday accused him of
collaborating with the South American country's largest rebel
movement, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.
</P>
<P>
   A one-time candidate for local office backed by former members
of the Marxist M-19 guerrilla movement, Restrepo had announced his
candidacy for October elections for the town council in San Luis.
</P>
<P>
   He was also the publisher of Tangente, a small monthly circular
containing local news about San Luis, a town of some 8,000
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's paramilitary militias, who are backed by landowners,
are waging a ''scorched earth'' campaign against suspected
leftists, committing massacres and executions. The government
claims it has no ties to the groups, although human rights groups
charge the militias enjoy tacit and sometimes direct support from
the military.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Tuesday, leftist National Liberation Army rebels,
Colombia's second-largest insurgent group, freed a congressman, 17
months after kidnapping him in the hijacking of a domestic
airliner.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels handed over lawmaker Juan Manuel Corzo to the Red
Cross in mountains near the northeastern town of San Pablo.
</P>
<P>
   He was then flown by helicopter to the nearby city of
Bucaramanga, where he reported being in good health except for a
knee injury sustained in captivity.
</P>
<P>
   With Corzo's release, only three of the 41 passengers and crew
aboard the Avianca flight forced down in rebel territory remain in
ELN hands.

<HEADLINE> Hyde Unenthused on Antitrust Bill  </HEADLINE>
By FREDERIC J. FROMMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bill to strengthen antitrust law in the wake
of multibillion-dollar mergers and a consolidating agriculture
industry received a cool reception Tuesday from the chairman of the
House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe the antitrust laws must be vigorously enforced,''
said Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., at a committee hearing on the bill.
But he said he saw no need to change the existing law.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, introduced by Rep. David Minge, D-Minn., would
increase criminal penalties for antitrust violations from $10
million to $100 million, increase federal scrutiny of mergers and
establish a position to oversee agriculture at the Justice
Department's antitrust division.
</P>
<P>
   It would also reverse a 1977 Supreme Court decision that ruled
only consumers who bought directly from price-fixing manufacturers
can sue for antitrust damages. The decision prevented consumers
from seeking compensation if the manufacturer sold to a middleman,
as is often the case.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said that a reversal of the precedent, known as the
Illinois Brick decision, was attractive on a ''theoretical level,''
but unworkable on a practical one.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our federal courts are absolutely choked with litigation,'' he
said. ''Allowing consumers to sue would lead to a flood of lawsuits
... and would overwhelm our already overburdened courts.''
</P>
<P>
   Minge, who represents an agricultural district in southwestern
Minnesota, argued that farmers were especially in need of relief
from concentration.
</P>
<P>
   ''Farmers have been left out'' of the booming economy, he said.
''And farmers are seeking answers as to why they have been left
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Many think it's because antitrust laws are not being enforced by
the Justice Department, Minge said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Next to low prices,'' said Leland Swenson, president of the
National Farmers Union, ''concentration is probably the number one
issue facing farmers and ranchers in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, testified in favor of the
bill as chairman of the Consumer Federation of America. He recalled
that a price-fixing case against vitamin manufacturers netted
corporate buyers of bulk vitamins more than $1 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Such companies, he argued, were not the true victims. ''In all
likelihood, they had long since passed on the increased costs of
these vitamins to their customers, the consumers who bought their
products,'' Metzenbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not a damn nickel,'' he said, pounding his fist on the table,
''for consumers, the ones who were truly hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Minge conceded before the hearing that his bill has little
chance of coming up for a vote this year, adding the odds would
improve if the Democrats win the House this fall.
</P>
<P>
   But he argued that the chances of reversing the Illinois Brick
decision are better now than they had been in the late '70s and
early '80s, when several legislative attempts to do so failed.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a new awareness of the cost to consumers from
violations of antitrust laws,'' he said, citing a judge's ruling
that Microsoft Corp. violated such laws.
</P>
<P>
   --------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 4321

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Eyes Iraqi Military  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. forces are monitoring Iraq's military
''with particular care and closeness'' during its late summer field
maneuvers, the Pentagon said Tuesday. Air reconnaissance is being
stepped up, but additional forces are not being sent.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Bacon, spokesman for Defense Secretary William Cohen,
said the Air Force is carrying out a normal rotation of fighters
and other aircraft that monitor Iraq's skies from bases in Kuwait
and Saudi Arabia. Until the exchange is complete in several days,
he said, the overlap will have extra U.S. aircraft in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have not made any increases in our force sizes in the
area,'' Bacon said. ''We maintain, on a daily basis, a very strong,
well-trained and active force from all services. And that's what
we're doing now with just a standard rotation.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Pentagon officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said additional Air Force planes and crews have been designated for
deployment on short notice if necessary, but they said this was a
standing practice and indicates no expectation of an imminent
buildup of the U.S. warplane force in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   The usual complement of U.S. forces in the area includes 20,000
to 25,000 sailors, soldiers, airmen and Marines.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force rotates its group, called an Aerospace
Expeditionary Force, every 90 days, and the swap-out now under way
is according to the normal schedule, Bacon said. To be completed in
a few days, it includes fighters, electronic warfare planes and
other support aircraft, Air Force officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon noted that late summer and early fall have sometimes been
periods of heightened tension with Iraq. President Saddam Hussein
sent the Iraqi army into Kuwait in August 1990. In October 1994
forces of the Iraqi Republican Guard moved to within a few miles of
Kuwait, which prompted a rush deployment of U.S. forces to the
area.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1996, Iraq sent troops into Kurdish regions in
northern Iraq and overran the town of Irbil. In September U.S.
forces launched cruise missiles on air defense targets in other
parts of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ''So we watch him closely all the time. We watch him with
particular care and closeness during this period of the year,''
Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It also is a period of time when he tends to be exercising his
military,'' the spokesman said. ''So they are engaged in a normal
training cycle at the end of the summer, early fall. And that
training cycle means that there are some movements of troops, and
it also can be used to disguise movements that he might make toward
either his own people or toward neighboring states.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week some Iraqi warplanes were moved away from their normal
bases, but they later returned, Bacon said. He said this could have
been a sign that the Iraqi air force was practicing defensive
maneuvers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and British aircraft have been monitoring the skies over
northern and southern Iraq since shortly after the Gulf War at the
end of February 1991. U.S. ships also help enforce a U.S. economic
embargo against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Skin Cancer Gives McCain a New Scar  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John McCain returned to the Senate spotlight
Tuesday with a new facial scar, as a result of skin cancer surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Republican and former Vietnam POW had surgery last
month to remove a cancerous tumor on his temple and several nearby
lymph nodes. Tests found no evidence the cancer had spread, meaning
McCain stands an excellent chance of being cured.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's first duty since the surgery as Senate Commerce
Committee chairman was holding a hearing on the recall of Firestone
tires. The former GOP presidential candidate came to the hearing
with a large bandage on his temple and a swollen scar trailing from
there to his jaw line, where the lymph nodes were removed.
</P>
<P>
   McCain spokeswoman Nancy Ives said the senator's doctors think
he is healing nicely.
</P>
<P>
   ''To have him looking so healthy following 5&AMP;frac12; hours of surgery,
we are very, very pleased,'' Ives said. ''We think he looks
great.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes before a press conference outside the Capitol Tuesday, a
McCain aide tried without success to reorient the cameras so the
speakers would be in the shade.
</P>
<P>
   Skin cancer is most often caused by exposure to the sun. McCain,
who had another tumor removed from his arm last month and one
removed from a shoulder in 1993, says he wears sunscreen, stays out
of the sun as much as possible and gets checkups every three
months.
</P>
<P>
   He opened the press conference, then retreated to the shade of a
nearby tree, and left soon thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   ''John's getting out of the sun -- which he keeps telling me to
do,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Hindu priest from Parma, Ohio, will deliver
Thursday's opening prayer in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Venkatachalapathi Samuldrala will be the first Hindu ever to
give the House invocation, said Rep. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was chosen to coincide with an address to a joint
session of Congress by India's prime minister, Atal Bihari
Vajpayee, Brown said. He requested that Samuldrala be invited to
serve as guest chaplain.
</P>
<P>
   Guest chaplains, nominated by members of Congress, offer opening
prayers two to three times a week when Congress is in session. On
Tuesday, Sister Catherine Moran of New Jersey became the first
Roman Catholic nun to give the opening prayer.

<HEADLINE> EU Echelon To Probe U.S. Chiefs  </HEADLINE>
By CONSTANT BRAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Senior members of a European Union
committee said Tuesday they want U.S. intelligence chiefs to
testify on whether an alleged American-led eavesdropping network
monitors the businesses of its European allies.
</P>
<P>
   European Parliament Vice President Gerhard Schmid, a German who
is a senior member on the committee investigating the alleged
Echelon spy network, said he would like to see the U.S. National
Security Agency head, Air Force Lt. Gen. Michael V. Hayden, come
before the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Schmid said he wants the American intelligence chiefs to discuss
how the NSA gathers intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it's up to me, we will have American representatives,
perhaps even U.S. senators and the director of the NSA,'' Schmid
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before the U.S. House Intelligence Committee in
April, Hayden and CIA Director George Tenet denied reports the
United States was involved in spying on Europeans and Americans as
part of a satellite surveillance network.
</P>
<P>
   Committee chairman Carlos Coelho of Portugal said that a list of
industry experts, politicians, U.S. and EU officials would be
called before the committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Echelon issue surfaced in February when a European
Parliament report outline what it said were Echelon's practices.
</P>
<P>
   It said Echelon intercepts ''billions of messages per hour,''
including telephone calls, fax transmissions and private e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   The EU Parliament set up the special probe in July. National
inquiries were also launched in France and Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   The spy network is said to include Canada, Britain, Australia
and New Zealand and is alleged to be led by the the National
Security Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Hearings into Echelon got under way Monday and continued
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   European Enterprise Commissioner Erkki Liikanen said he could
not deny the existence of Echelon, but said the European Union
would shortly implement new encryption and data protection rules to
improve privacy rights to help deter eavesdropping.

<HEADLINE> Organ Donation Edges Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Organ donation increased by nearly 4 percent
during the first half of 2000 after remaining flat in 1999, the
government said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   During the first six months of this year, there were 2,978 organ
donors. That compares to 2,875 during the first six months of 1999,
according to statistics compiled by the Department of Health and
Human Service and the Association of Organ Procurement
Organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our efforts to raise awareness about the importance of organ
donation appear to be paying off, but with 71,000 people on the
transplant waiting list, we still have a long way to go,'' HHS
Secretary Donna Shalala said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Organ donation rose 6 percent in 1998, the first substantial
increase since 1995, but was unchanged in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, HHS release guidelines to help hospitals and organ
banks implement new rules that require hospitals to notify organ
banks whenever someone dies in the hospital. The goal is to be sure
that organ donation professionals evaluate each potential donor and
talk with their families when appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown that many potential donors are never
identified or approached about donation.

<HEADLINE> Albright Discredits Milosevic  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
stepped up her campaign to discredit President Slobodan Milosevic
of Yugoslavia, accusing him through her senior aides of ''trying to
steal'' the Sept. 24 presidential and parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   Albright met with the foreign ministers of 12 Southeast European
countries, and also Montenegro, the independent-minded smaller
Yugoslav republic, on Tuesday to compare notes on Milosevic's
tactics and to affirm their support for his political foes.
</P>
<P>
   There was no consensus on whether Milosevic would win, the aides
told reporters afterward, but there also was no disagreement that
his tactics are antidemocratic.
</P>
<P>
   Milseovic's opponents accuse him of suppression of independent
media, intimidation of political foes, gerrymandering of election
districts to favor his supporters, preparing ballots with his
candidates already checked off, making jobs and retirement benefits
contingent on supporting him.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters were barred from the luncheon, which was held on the
sidelines of the annual U.N. General Assembly meetings. The aides
declined to be identified in giving their account of the
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia has refused to issue visas for European election
observers.
</P>
<P>
   The picture drawn near the Danube, where Milosevic launched his
campaign, was in sharp contrast to the one drawn by Albright's
aides.
</P>
<P>
   There Milosevic lauded the achievements of the Yugoslav people
and accused the West of sabotaging the country's recovery.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Aides Faulted in Visa Probe  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Justice Department official and a
subordinate improperly obtained U.S. visas for two Russian women
while visiting Moscow on government business, department
investigators said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a report, the Inspector General's office said that Robert
Bratt and Joseph Lake engaged in ''egregious conduct'' in 1997 and
that Lake filed visa forms with the U.S. embassy stating the two
women were connected to the Justice Department's criminal division.
</P>
<P>
   Bratt, who retired from the government last month, was the head
of the office serving the administrative needs of the Justice
Department's criminal division. He had traveled to Moscow as
coordinator for criminal division programs that train foreign
police agencies and prosecutors and judges in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   Bratt, who retired from the government last month, socialized
extensively with Yelena Koreneva and Ludmilla Bolgak during trips
to Moscow after telling an interpreter who also worked for a
''match-making'' agency that he would like to meet a single Russian
woman, according to the inspector general.
</P>
<P>
   When Bratt invited the women to the United States to visit,
Koreneva said she had previously been denied a visa.
</P>
<P>
   According to the IG's report, Bratt and Lake got around that
problem by telling the head of the embassy office responsible for
issuing visas that they wished to bring two women with whom they
had a professional relationship to the United States for
consultations.
</P>
<P>
   Bratt flatly denies being at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   According to the IG, The visa forms filed by Lake, an aide to
Bratt before retiring from the government in 1997, stated the two
women ''worked with the Executive Officer (EO) Criminal Division in
support of administrative functions, Moscow Office.'' The forms
were signed ''Joe Lake for BB.''
</P>
<P>
   The women never used the visas.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bratt and Lake knowingly used the referral process even though
they were aware that it required a government interest in the
women's visit and that no such government interest existed,'' the
report concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bransford, Bratt's attorney, said ''Mr. Bratt had nothing
to do with filling out those forms'' and ''he didn't encourage or
counsel Joe Lake in any way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bratt issued a statement saying that the IG's office ''is out of
control. ... The Inspector General could not find a flyspeck of
evidence of any illegality on my part.'' Bransford said the Justice
Department declined prosecution on this matter.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to locate Lake for comment were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said he was ''shocked'' that
Bratt and Lake ''used their government positions to get visas for
Russian women.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate part of the probe, the inspector general found
that Bratt's decision to hire former assistant attorney general Jo
Ann Harris as a consultant created an appearance of favoritism.
Harris was paid $27,000 for 42 days work on two conferences,
according to the inspector general. Bratt was a former subordinate
of Harris.

<HEADLINE> USEC Book Probe Ends  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE RIZZO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Nuclear Regulatory Commission told
lawmakers Tuesday it has completed a study of the U.S. Enrichment
Corp.'s finances and ruled out further action.
</P>
<P>
   USEC is the major world supplier of enriched uranium fuel for
commercial nuclear power plants, the only uranium enrichment
company in the United States. It supplies about three-fourths of
the U.S. market and more than a third of the world's.
</P>
<P>
   The company has been hurt by falling uranium prices. In the last
year, it has laid off workers, seen its credit rating reduced to
junk-bond level and decided to close one of its two enrichment
facilities, the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Piketon,
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ted Strickland, D-Ohio, has been trying to force the
company not to close the Piketon plant. The NRC decision was a blow
to Strickland's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to House Commerce Committee Chairman Tom Bliley,
R-Va., the NRC's chairman noted the company financial problems but
said there was no cause for action.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the financial trouble, regulators were asked to
examine whether USEC remained capable of fulfilling the legal
requirement that it be a ''reliable and economical domestic source
of enrichment services.''
</P>
<P>
   If USEC were found unable to meet that requirement, the NRC
could pull the company's certification. In the letter to Bliley,
NRC Chairman Richard Meserve said doing that would ''shut down a
domestic supply altogether and thus would not serve the ... broader
statutory purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   ''On the basis of this recent review of USEC's financial
situation, we conclude that we should not take action to modify,
suspend or revoke the certificates of certification,'' Meserve
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not believe that any further NRC study of the USEC
situation is justified, particularly in view of the fact that NRC
is limited in the action it can take to address the maintenance of
domestic enrichment services.''
</P>
<P>
   USEC had insisted it would continue to be the reliable source of
domestic uranium that the law requires.
</P>
<P>
   Strickland, the Ohio congressman, said he disagrees with the
NRC's interpretation of the requirement that USEC maintain a
reliable domestic uranium industry. ''I don't know how they do
that,'' he said. ''They have in a most illogical way chosen to
interpret language in the privatization agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Bliley's staff has been gathering documents in preparation for a
possible hearing into USEC's finances. As of Tuesday, a hearing had
not been scheduled.

<HEADLINE> 7 Hurt in South Africa Blast  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- A bomb exploded in a parking lot
near a mosque and an opposition party meeting Tuesday night and
injured seven people, the latest in a series of attacks in this
coastal city.
</P>
<P>
   The blast occurred in the largely Muslim neighborhood of
Gatesville, said Andre DuToit, chief detective of Western Cape
province. The bomb had been placed in a parking lot near the
mosque, a medical center and a hall where the Democratic Alliance
party was meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Seven people -- three women, three men and one child -- were
slightly injured, DuToit said. One of those injured was a police
officer guarding the political meeting, which was attended by
Gerald Morkel, the province's governor. The opposition party
controls the provincial government.
</P>
<P>
   Morkel had just arrived and entered the hall when the bomb went
off. He said he did not believe he was the intended target of the
bomb.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, the city -- a picturesque tourist
destination known for its tabletop mountains, pristine beaches and
vineyards -- has been hit with several attacks against restaurants,
police stations and gay bars. The attacks have left three people
dead, more than 100 injured and destroyed several buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, a car bomb exploded outside a crowded cafe in the
area of restaurants and bars frequented by students at the
University of Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
   No one was injured in the bombing, but it came a day after a
local judge was assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   No one has claimed responsibility for any of the attacks. But
police and politicians have blamed a Muslim vigilante group called
People Against Gangsterism and Drugs.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 of the group are awaiting trial on a range of charges
including possessing explosives.
</P>
<P>
   The group has denied responsibility for the attacks and says it
does not condone violence.

<HEADLINE> USEC Finance Probe Ends  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE RIZZO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Nuclear Regulatory Commission told
lawmakers Tuesday it has completed a study of the U.S. Enrichment
Corp.'s finances and ruled out further action.
</P>
<P>
   USEC is the major world supplier of enriched uranium fuel for
commercial nuclear power plants, the only uranium enrichment
company in the United States. It supplies about three-fourths of
the U.S. market and more than a third of the world's.
</P>
<P>
   The company has been hurt by falling uranium prices. In the last
year, it has laid off workers, seen its credit rating reduced to
junk-bond level and decided to close one of its two enrichment
facilities, the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Piketon,
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ted Strickland, D-Ohio, has been trying to force the
company not to close the Piketon plant. The NRC decision was a blow
to Strickland's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to House Commerce Committee Chairman Tom Bliley,
R-Va., the NRC's chairman noted the company financial problems but
said there was no cause for action.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the financial trouble, regulators were asked to
examine whether USEC remained capable of fulfilling the legal
requirement that it be a ''reliable and economical domestic source
of enrichment services.''
</P>
<P>
   If USEC were found unable to meet that requirement, the NRC
could pull the company's certification. In the letter to Bliley,
NRC Chairman Richard Meserve said doing that would ''shut down a
domestic supply altogether and thus would not serve the ... broader
statutory purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   ''On the basis of this recent review of USEC's financial
situation, we conclude that we should not take action to modify,
suspend or revoke the certificates of certification,'' Meserve
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not believe that any further NRC study of the USEC
situation is justified, particularly in view of the fact that NRC
is limited in the action it can take to address the maintenance of
domestic enrichment services.''
</P>
<P>
   USEC had insisted it would continue to be the reliable source of
domestic uranium that the law requires.
</P>
<P>
   Strickland, the Ohio congressman, said he disagrees with the
NRC's interpretation of the requirement that USEC maintain a
reliable domestic uranium industry. ''I don't know how they do
that,'' he said. ''They have in a most illogical way chosen to
interpret language in the privatization agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Bliley's staff has been gathering documents in preparation for a
possible hearing into USEC's finances. As of Tuesday, a hearing had
not been scheduled.

<HEADLINE> House Passes Ocean Measure 390 to 8  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With decades of research and billions of
dollars spent on studying the heavens, it's time for Congress to
start setting its sights much lower -- into the oceans, that is.
</P>
<P>
   That's the message behind a House measure that passed 390 to 8
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We spend billions of dollars on the space program because it
fascinates us as a people,'' said Rep. Jim Greenwood, R-Pa., the
bill's sponsor. ''In comparison, we spend pennies on ocean
research. But our survival is completely dependent on the survival
of the oceans.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenwood said the ocean floor should be searched for plants and
animals with human lifesaving potential, saying cures for AIDS,
cancer, diabetes and other diseases may be found in the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which the Senate has not yet considered, would earmark
$1.5 million for the National Academy of Sciences to set up a panel
that would organize an international workshop on ocean exploration.
</P>
<P>
   Other interested countries would be asked to help pay for
research and exploration programs, Greenwood said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's definitely a huge, unmet potential in the oceans,''
said Morgan Gopnik, director of the Ocean Studies Board of the
National Research Council, the operating arm of the National
Academy of Sciences. ''We haven't spent much time exploring the
ocean for scientific and pharmaceutical possibilities, but we
really should.''
</P>
<P>
   In other business, the House passed by voice vote a bill that
would let the federal government continue monitoring state
fisheries to make sure they prevent overfishing. Last year, $7
million was appropriated to carry out these activities through the
Atlantic Coastal Fisheries Act. This bill, which heads to the
Senate, would spend $10 million a year from 2001 through 2005.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's one of the most successful pieces of environmental
legislation Congress ever passed,'' said John H. Dunnigan,
executive director of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries
Commission. ''It recognizes the authority of individual states, and
it holds them accountable for managing their fisheries.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Republicans Talk Tax Cuts  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Running out of time, President Clinton and
Republican leaders wrangled Tuesday over how to deal with huge
budget surpluses, tax cuts and spending priorities as Congress
struggles to rush out of town to campaign for the November
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Pledging to seek a ''fair middle ground,'' Republicans
challenged Democrats to agree to reserve 90 percent of expected
budget surpluses to pay off the debt. But Democrats said the GOP
idea sounded like a one-year gimmick instead of a long-term
commitment. ''We smell a rat,'' said Senate Minority Leader Tom
Daschle, D-S.D.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met with Republican and Democratic leaders around the
long, rectangular table in the Cabinet Room. With a tight
presidential race and both sides battling for control of Congress,
there was a heavy air of politics.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott complained that the White
House has not been working with Republicans to find legislative
compromises. House Speaker Dennis Hastert said, ''You can't
negotiate with a wall between two parties. You've got to take the
wall down and start to talk. And that's what I hope that we
achieved today.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott acknowledged that the proposal to use most of the budget
surplus for the debt was a one-year idea. Daschle said the
Republicans would have to disavow the tax cuts proposed by GOP
presidential candidate George W. Bush if they wanted to make a
long-term promise to pay down the debt.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides appeared to agree that Congress would increase the
minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., said, ''I don't come
away from the meeting with a lot of confidence'' that Republicans
and Democrats can find agreement for a prescription drug benefit
under Medicare and a patients' bill of rights to expand consumer
protections in HMO programs.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said the Republican leadership ''gave us an absolute,
ironclad commitment'' that so-called hate crimes legislation is not
likely to pass this year. The Senate passed the legislation in June
as an amendment to a defense bill; the House declined to include
those provisions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I could see the expression on the president's face, and his
own expression of concern that it not be proclaimed as dead for the
year,'' Daschle said. ''We've got to see if we can find a way to
pass it.''
</P>
<P>
   The hate crimes legislation proposes adding crimes motivated by
sexual orientation, gender or disability to the list of offenses
already covered under a 1968 federal law. It also would allow
federal prosecutors to pursue a hate crime case if local
authorities refuse to press charges.
</P>
<P>
   Lott and Hastert challenged the Democrats to agree to reserve 90
percent of expected budget surpluses to pay off the debt -- leaving
about $27 billion for end-of-the-year budget deals with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has set an Oct. 6 target for adjourning but is expected
to miss that deadline by a week or so. The Republican-led House and
Senate have passed only two of the 13 spending bills that fund the
operation of the government.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said both sides need to ''just keep on trucking'' and
''do the best we can. And then the American people will make the
judgment in November (and) the country will go on and be just
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Listing his priorities, Clinton called for more spending for
education and adoption of a patients' bill of rights that would
give consumers the right to sue insurance companies for inadequate
care. Further, he urged passage of hate-crimes legislation, a
minimum wage increase, a long-term health care credit and ''new
markets'' tax breaks to spur investment in depressed communities.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they wanted to strengthen Social Security and
Medicare, reduce taxes for workers and small businesses and
increase spending for education. Lott said he hoped the Senate
would complete work this week or next on a major trade bill with
China.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got a lot of disasters and agriculture needs,'' Lott
said, noting the devastation of Western wildfires. Clinton has
asked Congress to increase spending by nearly $1.6 billion for fire
relief.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have passed a marriage penalty tax cut that would
have cost $292 billion over 10 years and a bill that would have
eliminated the estate tax costing $105 billion over 10 years.
Clinton vetoed both of them and they're basically off the table
now.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders are still pushing a business tax relief package
totaling about $76 billion over 10 years as a companion to the $1
increase in the minimum wage over two years. The House has also
passed a bill expanding contribution limits for individual
retirement accounts and 401(k) plans that would cost $52 billion
over 10 years, as well as a package intended to revitalize
impoverished communities costing $21 billion over 10 years. One
other bill repealing the telephone excise tax would cost $55
billion over a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Those items total $204 billion over 10 years.

<HEADLINE> Congress Questions Addicts Benefits  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Social Security Administration officials
Tuesday defended the agency from criticism that it had mishandled
efforts to purge alcoholics and drug addicts from the disability
rolls.
</P>
<P>
   The agency responded that its findings indicated the number of
alcoholics and drug addicts mistakenly receiving benefits was much
smaller than originally estimated in an independent audit.
</P>
<P>
   ''The results are that a total of 339 ... were found to be
improperly receiving benefits,'' Kenneth Nibali, associate
commissioner for disability for the Social Security Administration,
told the House Budget Committee's Task Force on Welfare Tuesday.
''In retrospect we can see that we should have initially reviewed
even those cases.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency said a problem in its coding system allowed some
people to remain on the rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Nibali's comments were in response to a May report by the Social
Security Administration's inspector general, estimating that about
3,190 individuals were incorrectly paid $38.7 million in disability
and Social Security benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Nibali said the agency did find just over 2,000 others in its
review that were released from the rolls for unrelated reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ''We took action as soon as the Inspector General brought this
to our attention,'' Nibali said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress in 1996 passed a law eliminating drug addiction and
alcoholism as conditions for which individuals could legally
qualify for Social Security and disability benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Substance abusers who have other conditions that qualify them
for benefits remain eligible, but eligibility was terminated for
those who would not be disabled if they stopped abusing drugs or
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the law was passed, the agency notified more than
209,000 beneficiaries that their benefits would be terminated. By
the end of 1998, benefits for those more than half of those
individuals had stopped. The others were determined to be still
eligible for assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers Tuesday questioned the agency on why it took so long
to clear the rolls.
</P>
<P>
   ''Each dollar used inappropriately in payments to these people
could have been better used in their treatment or to provide
assistance to other disabled individuals,'' said Rep. Jim Nussle,
chairman of the task force.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Guam War Claims Measure  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than 50 years after Japanese forces
occupied Guam during World War II, the House passed a measure that
begins looking at how to compensate Guam residents for war claims.
</P>
<P>
   With the passage of the bill, ''the people of Guam move one step
closer to being healed from the brutalities of enemy occupation
during World War II,'' said Delegate Robert Underwood, D-Guam.
</P>
<P>
   During the occupation, Japanese soldiers tortured and terrorized
the people of Guam, who concealed the presence of U.S. soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, the U.S. government agreed to compensate the
people for war claims on property, personal injury or death, but
the payments were never made.
</P>
<P>
   The bill that passed the House by a voice vote, establishes a
federal commission to review the claims, determine the number of
beneficiaries and then recommend a compensation amount to Congress.
</P>

<HEADLINE> The Netherlands OKs Gay Marriages  </HEADLINE>
By ANTHONY DEUTSCH
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP)-- The Netherlands lawmakers on
Tuesday gave same-sex couples the right to marriage and all the
trappings, including adoption and divorce -- approving legislation
that provides gays rights beyond those offered in any other
country.
</P>
<P>
   The new law will bring little change to the daily lives of most
gays in a country that has long been at the vanguard of gay rights.
But activists say it marks a bold step toward recognizing the
equality of gay and heterosexual unions in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers thumped their desks in approval when the vote passed
109-33 in the lower house, and some of the scores of witnesses in
the packed public gallery applauded and embraced. The bill still
needs approval by the upper house, considered a formality, and is
expected to take effect next year.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents warned the legislation will isolate the Netherlands
and said it threatens Dutch values.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going in the completely wrong direction,'' said
lawmaker Kees van der Staaij of the Reformed Political Party. ''We
are ending an age-old tradition anchored in the Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, gay couples can convert their current
''registered same-sex partnerships'' to full-fledged marriages,
complete with wider adoption rights and guidelines for divorce.
However, they are barred from adopting children overseas because of
potential confrontation with countries that don't allow gays to
marry.
</P>
<P>
   ''We now have a choice,'' said Mark Wagenbuur who came to The
Hague to witness the vote with his partner, Lei Lennaerts, and two
other gay friends. Wagenbuur, 34, and Lennaerts, 35, don't plan any
adoptions, but said they will formalize their long-standing
relationship with a formal marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ''Should I ask his father for his hand or should he ask mine?''
Wagenbuur asked with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The law puts the Dutch at the forefront of the gay rights
movement, a position held by Denmark since that country gave
official sanction to gay marriages in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Danish gay couples enjoy the same rights as heterosexuals except
for the right to adopt children. In May 1999, they won the right to
adopt their partner's children but adoption from outside the
marriage remains forbidden. Sweden also allows gays to register as
couples with most of the rights of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Dutch legislators said the bill will not open the Netherlands to
so-called ''marriage tourism,'' since marriages are allowed only
for citizens or people with residency permits.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tourists cannot marry here,'' said Boris Dittrich, one of the
legislators who initiated the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Gay couples who legally wed in the Netherlands also will find
few countries recognizing the marriage, he said, citing a survey
conducted by the Dutch Foreign Ministry. Only a few Scandinavian
and European countries said they would recognize the marriages of
Dutch gays who move to their countries.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the U.S. government has not addressed the issue. He said that
it appeared to be a matter for individual states to decide.
</P>
<P>
   However, recognition of such unions is questionable in the
United States. Thirty-two states have already adopted laws
specifically outlawing same sex marriage. Vermont has the closest
thing after approval of a law by the state legislature last spring.
That law creates civil unions, a legal institution parallel to
marriage that provides the same rights, benefits and
responsibilities to same-sex couples. But the Vermont law does not
recognize marriages between same-sex couples.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Fielding, spokesman of the European Union Commission,
said recognition of Dutch gay marriages will be ''entirely a matter
for each member nation'' in the 15-member union.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until two years ago that the Netherlands allowed
same-sex couples to register as partners and to claim pensions,
social security and inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   However, the law lagged behind the popular acceptance of gays in
the Netherlands, especially in Amsterdam, where the Homo Monument
is a popular tourist attraction and where gays annually hold a
raucous floating parade on the central canals watched by tens of
thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
   Van der Staaij, who opposed the bill, warned Dutch gay couples
could face problems in other countries where homosexuality remains
taboo or illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch take the lead on other social issues besides gay
rights. Officials tolerate the use of small quantities of so-called
soft-drugs such as marijuana and hashish, allowing cafes to sell
cannabis joints and a cup of coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Prostitution is on open display in well-regulated red-light
districts, where scantly clad women sit like merchandise in shop
windows. Private television stations often show late-night
soft-porn movies.

<HEADLINE> Croatia Arrests War Crime Suspects  </HEADLINE>
By SNJEZANA VUKIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- In the biggest crackdown yet on suspected
war criminals, Croatia on Tuesday arrested two suspects sought by a
U.N. tribunal and issued an international warrant for two others.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia, a former republic of Yugoslavia, also detained several
persons in connection with the recent killing of a witness to
atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   All the arrested are ethnic Croats and at least two are Croatian
army officers.
</P>
<P>
   War crimes suspects in the former Yugoslavia have been mainly
apprehended by the international police. Several were arrested by
Croatia in the past few years, but never in such a comprehensive
action.
</P>
<P>
   The detentions are part of the Croatian government's commitment
to deal with a sensitive national issue that could fuel protests at
home and turn some Croats against the new leadership, which took
power just eight months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ivica Racan dismissed such fears.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't believe anyone sane would protest ... the arrest of
war criminals,'' he told the state-run news agency HINA.
''Democratic Croatia is resolute: War criminals can no longer live
freely in here. The rule of law has been enforced.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the arrests were made at the request of the U.N. war
crimes tribunal at The Hague, Netherlands. The cases involved
attacks on Muslims during Bosnia's 1992-1995 war.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Jozo Rados told Croatian television that Gen.
Ivan Andabaka -- a Croat from Bosnia who served in Croatian army --
was taken into custody Tuesday. In the 1993 war in Bosnia, Andabaka
was a member of the so-called Convicts Battalion, widely believed
to have been involved in atrocities against Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   The second suspect arrested on behalf of the U.N. tribunal was
Ignac Kostroman, television said. Croatian media has long
speculated that he was involved in the 1993 massacre of more than
100 Muslims in the central Bosnian village of Ahmici.
</P>
<P>
   Police also detained persons in the recent killing of Milan
Levar, a Croat who had testified about the 1991 crimes against
Serbs in Gospic, television reported. The crimes allegedly occurred
during Croatia's war for independence from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   One of the soldiers whom Levar blamed for leading the killings
in Gospic, Tihomir Oreskovic, was apparently among the arrested,
the television said.
</P>
<P>
   Racan did not confirm the specific arrests, but Croatian
television is known to have reliable sources within the Cabinet.
The Associated Press also received confirmation of the arrests from
a government source who declined to be named.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, police in the central Adriatic city of Zadar said
late Tuesday they arrested three people on charges of harboring war
crimes suspects. Croatian newspapers reported this week that some
police and secret service agents were providing hideouts for
suspects.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday also, the Croatian branch of Interpol said an
international warrant was issued for Pasko Ljubicic, 35, and Vlado
Cosic, 38, whom Croatia suspects of participating in the Ahmici
massacre.
</P>
<P>
   The two escaped last week's police search of their hideout in
Zadar.
</P>
<P>
   The Hague court has not indicted the men, and its officials have
said they would let Croatia prosecute them.
</P>
<P>
   The case would represent Croatia's first probe into war crimes
allegedly committed by its own citizens.

<HEADLINE> EU Lifts Sanctions Against Austria  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT H. REID
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- European Union members lifted diplomatic
sanctions against Austria on Tuesday after an investigating
committee concluded the measures had stoked the very nationalistic
fervor they were designed to punish.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions were imposed in February after conservative
Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel brought members of the far-right
Freedom Party into his coalition government. Schuessel hailed the
decision to lift the measures as ''a great success for Austria.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice Chancellor Susanne Riess-Passer, the current leader of the
Freedom Party, said a ''dark chapter has ended.'' She added that
the decision to end the sanctions affirmed that citizens of
individual EU member states ''have the right to determine their own
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Announcing an end to the sanctions, the French government, which
holds the European Union's rotating presidency and which
spearheaded the sanctions, said the measures had been useful and
''they can now be lifted.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement said the EU would remain ''especially vigilant''
about the Freedom Party, which campaigned against immigration and
EU expansion in the run-up to last year's parliamentary elections.
The Freedom Party finished second among the six national political
parties.
</P>
<P>
   But Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak condemned the decision
Tuesday, suggesting in a statement that it would have been
appropriate to continue the sanctions as long as the Freedom Party
remains in the government.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, a spokeswoman for the Israeli foreign ministry,
Yaffa Ben-Ari, said there were no plans to send back Israel's
ambassador to Austria, which it withdrew after the formation of the
new government.
</P>
<P>
   Joerg Haider, the Freedom Party's best-known figure and its
former leader, had long been criticized for remarks made years ago
sympathetic toward aspects of Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime.
</P>
<P>
   Under the sanctions, Austria's 14 EU partners broke off
bilateral political contacts, restricted the promotion of Austrians
at EU headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, and gave Austrian
ministers the cold shoulder at EU meetings. The diplomatic measures
also included boycotts of school trips, cultural exchanges and
military exercises.
</P>
<P>
   Although the measures had little impact on ordinary Austrians,
they triggered a backlash among the Austrian public, which
considered them an affront to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The measures also led to an outcry in Denmark and other small EU
countries fearful of domination by France, Germany and other major
powers in the grouping. The Danish government lobbied to end the
sanctions before the Sept. 28 national referendum on whether to
join the common European currency, the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Political leaders in some former communist countries seeking EU
membership, such as Poland and the Czech Republic, complained that
imposing sanctions on a democratic government represented a
violation of sovereignty similar to controls imposed by the former
Soviet Union on its Eastern European satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a three-member committee appointed to study the issue
concluded that the sanctions ''already triggered nationalistic
feelings in Austria'' primarily because they were seen as directed
against the Austrian people rather than the government.
</P>
<P>
   The report also said the measures had become
''counterproductive'' and should be ended. It found that Austria
was ''respectful of common European values'' and had demonstrated
respect for the rights of immigrants, refugees and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recommendation, Schuessel said one undisclosed EU
member, presumably France, had mounted a last-ditch effort to
suspend, rather than lift, the sanctions and to establish an
''official mechanism'' to monitor Austrian compliance with EU
principles.	   He attributed the decision to lift the sanctions immediately to
Austria's ''patience and steadfastness.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Today no one has lost face,'' Schuessel told reporters.
''However, a dark veil has fallen from the face of Europe.''

<HEADLINE> House Passes Bill To Honor Slaves  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than 200 years after work began on the
nation's Capitol, the House passed legislation Tuesday to honor the
slaves who helped build the United States' seat of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, approved by a voice vote, would authorize the
speaker of the House and president pro tempore of the Senate to
establish a special task force to study the history and
contributions of slave laborers toward building the Capitol. The
task force would then recommend an appropriate memorial to be
displayed on the Capitol grounds.
</P>
<P>
   A companion measure is pending in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is time that we recognize the contributions of these slave
laborers,'' said Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., a sponsor of the
legislation with Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga. ''Let us reach back today
through the thin veil of time and unshackle their hands so that we
can shake them and say thank you -- ever so belatedly -- to these
great Americans who built this great monument to freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis added, ''These men, these slaves, laid the very foundation
of our democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, congressional historians revealed that slaves did much
of the 18th and 19th century work constructing the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Slaves were the largest locally available labor pool in 1790
when Congress ordered a new capital to be carved out of two
slave-owning states, Virginia and Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   When the three commissioners in charge of construction started
building in 1792 they hired field hands from local small farmers
and planters.
</P>
<P>
   Local slaves were available to be rented from their owners
cheaply, an average of $55 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The owners supplied clothing and blankets. The city
commissioners made sleeping space available in a barracks and
provided food: cornmeal, pork or beef, and shad in season.
</P>
<P>
   Many white laborers worked under similar conditions and ate the
same food, but their employment was voluntary and they could keep
the money they earned.
</P>
<P>
   Local historian Bob Arnebeck, in his 1991 book, ''Through a
Fiery Trial, Building Washington, 1790-1800,'' wrote that as work
began, slaves served as axmen, cutting trees on Jenkins Hill on
which the new Capitol would stand. Some helped square logs needed
for construction. Others cleared trees and stumps from the new
streets laid out by city planner Pierre L'Enfant.

<HEADLINE> Report: Transplant May Kill Cancer  </HEADLINE>
By JANET McCONNAUGHEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new, experimental approach to treating tumors -- transfusing
blood cells from a patient's sibling -- can reverse the spread of
kidney cancer, researchers report.
</P>
<P>
   The cancer killers are T-cells, the roving attack dogs of the
immune system. When they work, they usually go after the body but
do even worse damage to tumors, according to the study appearing in
Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the biggest advance in kidney cancer in my research
career -- in my almost 22 years of doing kidney cancer research,''
said Dr. Nicholas Vogelzang of University of Chicago, a medical
adviser for the Kidney Cancer Association.
</P>
<P>
   However, the authors at the National Institutes of Health
cautioned that the approach is still being studied and is itself
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Transfusions have been used for decades to treat leukemia and
other blood cancers. But this is their first use against solid
cancers.
</P>
<P>
   Vogelzang said Chicago is among at least 10 institutions testing
the approach described in the study by Dr. Richard Childs of the
National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Childs and researchers at the National Cancer Institute are
preparing tests against 15 other cancers, including those of the
lung, breast, prostate and esophagus.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only way we're going to know if it works is trials. Animal
trials have not been particularly helpful,'' Childs said.
</P>
<P>
   The study describes the first 19 people to get transfusions to
treat cancer which had spread from the kidney. Tumors disappeared
completely in three, and shrank to half their former size in seven
others.
</P>
<P>
   Only two of those seven had a later relapse, and one of them
improved again after additional treatment with a different immune
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The patients got transfusions of both stem cells, the immature
cells which develop into various kinds of blood cells, and T-cells.
</P>
<P>
   It was the T-cells which destroyed tumors, Childs said.
</P>
<P>
   No patient has been followed for more than about 2&AMP;frac12; years. Once
cancer has been in remission for five years, doctors feel there is
a reasonable chance of remaining cancer-free.
</P>
<P>
   The approach should stay experimental for now and will be
nowhere near a cure-all even if more studies and longer follow-up
show that it should be an accepted treatment, Childs said.
</P>
<P>
   Two of 19 patients died from the treatment itself, and the
T-cells took months to work.
</P>
<P>
   Four months after John Sirmans' transplant, his tumors were
still growing. A CAT scan of his lungs ''looked like golf balls in
a sock,'' said Sirmans, of Dayton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   That was in December. He thought that Christmas would be his
last. ''Then 30 days later, I came back and these things were
shrinking like crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Childs' article lists Sirmans as a patient whose tumors had
shrunk at least by half. He has been cancer-free since summer.
</P>
<P>
   About 30,000 new cases of kidney cancer are found each year in
the United States. If it is caught before it spreads, removing the
kidney may cure the patient. But in about 11,000, it is out of the
kidney before it is found. Then it moves swiftly, often killing
within a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would guess only about 20 percent would have slow-enough
growing tumors that this would even be an option,'' said Dr. Robert
Figlin of UCLA, also a KCA adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Vogelzang disagreed. He said the approach could be considered
not only for the top 25 percent, who have an average survival time
of 20 months, but for the 53 percent whose average life span is 10
months from the time new tumors show up.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is finding a donor. There's only a one in four
chance that a brother's or sister's blood will be a good enough
match for the patient's. The donor also must be healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Since Childs' study is so small -- he has now done 33
transplants, with 15 patients improved and more time needed to
evaluate four -- it could be a fluke that about half got better.
</P>
<P>
   Side effects are major. All but two patients whose tumors
improved had rashes or diarrhea and gut pain from graft-vs.-host
disease.
</P>
<P>
   The new T-cells killed one patient. A second died of an
infection resulting from the transplant. Figlin called the death
rate unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Childs has tried T-cell transfusions on eight people with skin
cancer. None responded. However, he said he does not know whether
that is because it does not work at all, or because the patients'
cancer spread too fast to let the T-cells get to work.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers think that other cancers are less likely to
respond to immune system therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nonsense,'' said Dr. Alan Houghton, chief of clinical
immunology at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there's pretty good evidence that a number of other
types of cancers can be recognized by the immune system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The report is the second this year about treatments which use
the immune system against spreading kidney cancer. A report in
March said that four patients' tumors disappeared and two others'
shrank by more than half after 17 people were given a vaccine-like
treatment.

<HEADLINE> Bodies Recovered From Marine Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The bodies of two Marine Corps aviators were
recovered in the wreckage of an F/A-18D Hornet jet fighter that
collided Monday with another Hornet in the skies near Yuma, Ariz.,
the Marine Corps announced.
</P>
<P>
   Killed in the crash were Capt. Bret O. Hines, the pilot, and
Maj. Nicholas Ferencz III, the weapons systems officer. Hines, 27,
was from Richmond, Va., and Ferencz, 36, was from Cleveland, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The other Hornet landed safely with relatively minor damage,
according to a statement distributed by Marine Corps headquarters
in the Pentagon on Tuesday. Neither the pilot nor the weapons
systems officer was injured.
</P>
<P>
   Neither plane was carrying live munitions, the Marines said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no early indication of what caused the collision, and
an investigation was under way.
</P>
<P>
   The Hornet that crashed at about 4:30 p.m. local (6:30 p.m. EDT)
on the Barry M. Goldwater Range, east of Yuma, was from Marine
Fighter Attack Squadron 242 base at Marine Corps Air Station
Miramar, Calif.

Political Battle Over Health Funds
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- The federal-provincial deal to reinvest in health
sets the stage for new political battles at the provincial level
about how the money should be spent.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers fear governments will show what they consider a
longstanding bias in favor of technology over new health care
staff.
</P>
<P>
   There's particular concern about the massive project to
computerize patient records so they can be retrieved on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I'm really ill and I need somebody to take care of my
needs, I don't really care that my health care record is on some
information database somewhere,'' Roasalee Longmoore of the
Saskatchewan Union of Nurses, said after the agreement was
announced.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want somebody to look after me.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's agreement sets up three targeted funds to deal with
priorities deemed most urgent, including $1 billion for medical
equipment and $500 million for information technology.
</P>
<P>
   There's no targeted fund to train or recruit new doctors and
nurses.

Cancer Society Asks Judge To Back New Cigarette Warning Rules
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- The Canadian Cancer Society urged a court
Tuesday to reject a request by tobacco firms for a delay in
introducing larger health warnings on cigarette packages.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco companies have asked for a delay of a few months in
the federal regulations due to take effect Dec. 23.
</P>
<P>
   But Julie Desrosiers, lawyer for the cancer society, dismissed
the tobacco firms' pleadings that they couldn't increase the size
of warnings in time for the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not the first time they've made this argument,'' said
Desrosiers, citing similar objections raised by the tobacco
companies when the current warnings were introduced five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Quebec Superior Court Justice Danielle Grenier, who spent Monday
and Tuesday listening to arguments on the regulation-delay issue,
said she plans to issue a decision on the point quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Grenier said her ruling, which could come as soon as Friday,
will deal strictly with the question of a delay. It won't tackle
the larger issue of whether the federal regulations are
unconstitutional or whether they're an infringement on the firms'
trademark rights.

Arrests, Boats Seized in New Brunswick Raid
</P>
<P>
   BURNT CHURCH, New Brunswick (AP) -- Up to 14 people were taken
into custody Tuesday as the Department of Fisheries seized boats
from several native bands fishing in waters off New Brunswick's
Burnt Church reserve.
</P>
<P>
   A native official said Burnt Church Chief Wilbur Dedam was among
those arrested, but Fisheries spokesman Jim Jones said he couldn't
confirm that.
</P>
<P>
   Fisheries officials say those accused will face charges under
the Criminal Code and Fisheries Act for fishing illegally.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some will undoubtedly face a number of charges,'' Jones said
from Moncton, New Brunswick
</P>
<P>
   One of the native boats capsized during the raid, dumping four
people into Miramichi Bay, the scene of an ongoing dispute over
native lobster fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Somerville, a spokeswoman with Burnt Church, said natives
were hauling in traps when they were approached by Fisheries
officers. She said the native boat that capsized was rammed by a
Fisheries vessel.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're looking at a situation that is basically becoming
absurd,'' Somerville told CBC Newsworld.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said one native fisherman was apparently hurt in the raid.
</P>
<P>
   Four boats were seized. Two belong to the Big Cove reserve,
located north of Moncton. The others are from Burnt Church and
Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   Former Ontario premier Bob Rae said Tuesday he hoped the
seizures wouldn't affect the proposed mediation process he will be
leading.

<HEADLINE> House Debates Boy Scouts' Policy  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans, warning of an attack on
fundamental American values, on Tuesday berated a small group of
lawmakers proposing that the Boy Scouts' federal charter be revoked
because of the organization's policy toward gays.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats accused the GOP majority of a political stunt in
bringing a bill with no chance of passage to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   While the outcome of the vote on Wednesday is not in doubt, the
issue renewed the debate over the relationship between the Boy
Scouts and the federal government rising out of the group's stance
on excluding homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's chief sponsor, Rep. Lynn Woolsey, D-Calif., said she
was a Girl Scout and one of her sons was a Boy Scout. ''We're not
saying the Boy Scouts are bad; we're saying that intolerance is
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I know the value of scouting, and that's why I believe
scouting should be available to all boys, not just to some boys,''
said Woolsey, the only Democrat to speak in favor of the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, one Republican after another rose in opposition.
''It's an attack on the fundamental values of America,'' said Rep.
Chris Cannon, R-Utah, led by ''a small group of extremists on the
minority side.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They truly ought to be ashamed,'' said Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga.,
of the ''denigration and assault on the Boy Scouts of America.''
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said in a statement
that he brought the bill to the floor without hearings or a
committee vote ''to demonstrate the lack of support for those who
have declared open season on the Boy Scouts.''
</P>
<P>
   Woolsey said she wasn't told until Monday evening that
Republicans were taking up her legislation. It ''was a total
surprise to me.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're disappointed that this bill would even be considered,''
countered Boy Scouts spokesman Gregg Shields. He said having a
federal charter is an honor and ''we hope to continue to live up to
that honor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boy Scouts of America got its federal charter in 1916, six
years after it was founded. It is one of about 90 groups with such
designation, an honorary title given to patriotic, charitable and
education organizations.
</P>
<P>
   While it confers no specific benefits, receiving a federal
charter is a mark of prestige and national recognition for a group.
Among other groups with federal charters are the American Legion,
Future Farmers of America, the National Tropical Botanical Garden
and the National Ski Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision in June, upheld the Boy
Scouts' ban on homosexuals serving as troop leaders. That ruling
may also give legal backing to the 6.2 million-member
organization's rejection of gay youths as members.
</P>
<P>
   The Scouts asserted that homosexual conduct is inconsistent with
the values it seeks to instill.
</P>
<P>
   But while the high court sided with the group's First Amendment
rights to ''expressive association,'' the Boy Scout relationship
with the federal government was brought into question when
President Clinton, five days before the ruling, issued an executive
order barring discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in
federally conducted education and training programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Department in August asked the Justice Department
for guidance on how that order affected the holding of Boy Scout
Jamborees on federal lands.
</P>
<P>
   GOP presidential nominee George W. Bush and other Republicans
quickly accused the administration of trying to throw the scouts
off federal lands. But Attorney General Janet Reno, in a statement
this month, said the tradition of Boy Scouts using federal lands
for camping and other activities could continue.
</P>
<P>
   Woolsey has also urged Clinton to resign as honorary president
of the Boy Scouts because of the policy toward gays. Her office
said the White House has not responded to that request. Shields
said every president since Taft has served as honorary president.
</P>
<P>
   After the June Supreme Court ruling, Clinton said he is
''generally against discrimination against gays.'' But he refused
to criticize the Scouts or the court's ruling. ''The Boy Scouts
still are -- they're a great group. They do a lot of good.''
</P>

<HEADLINE> Annan Presses for Peace in Cyprus  </HEADLINE>
By ALEX EFTY
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary-General Kofi Annan told rival
Cypriot leaders Tuesday that it was time to move toward the
reunification of their war-divided island.
</P>
<P>
   Annan's statement came after he met separately with President
Glafcos Clerides, the internationally recognized Greek Cypriot
leader, and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash. Both sides have
been trying to reach a settlement through indirect talks.
</P>
<P>
   Denktash, however, has refused to meet Clerides directly, or
discuss substantive issues, unless he is given equal status to
Clerides through the recognition of his breakaway state in the
Turkish-occupied north of the island.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the course of these talks I have ascertained that the
parties share a common desire to bring about ... a comprehensive
settlement enshrining a new partnership on which to build a better
future in peace, security and prosperity on a united island,''
Annan told the leaders in a statement that was distributed by
Alvaro de Soto, Annan's special adviser on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe the time has now come to move ahead,'' Annan said,
adding that the ''equal status of the parties must and should be
recognized explicitly in the comprehensive settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders left the U.N. headquarters after their separate
meetings of about one hour each with Annan without saying anything
to waiting reporters.
</P>
<P>
   De Soto refused to say how each reacted to Annan's statement,
but said indirect talks would continue Wednesday and would likely
last for the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   De Soto said the Security Council resolutions, which rule out
recognition of the breakaway statelet, continue to be binding.
</P>
<P>
   Cyprus has been divided into a Greek Cypriot controlled south
and Turkish-occupied north since a 1974 Turkish invasion following
a coup by supporters of union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Clerides insists a settlement must be based on the council
resolutions envisaging the island's reunification as a single state
with two federal regions, one Greek and one Turkish Cypriot.
</P>
<P>
   The resolutions, which are rejected by Denktash and the Turkish
government, also call for the withdrawal of the 35,000 Turkish
troops and estimated 80,000 Turkish mainland settlers introduced to
the north and the return there of 180,000 Greek Cypriot refugees
who fled or were expelled in the wake of the invasion.
</P>
<P>
   The Turkish side insists on the recognition of the breakaway
state as a first step to the establishment of a confederation of
two separate states, with the Greek and Turkish Cypriots living
separately.

<HEADLINE> Cubs 2, Reds 1  </HEADLINE>
By TERRY KINNEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Kerry Wood pitched a four-hitter for his first
complete game since elbow surgery almost 1&AMP;frac12; years ago, leading the
Chicago Cubs over the Cincinnati Reds 2-1 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Wood (7-7) struck out eight and walked two in the second
complete game of his career, the first since he struck out a
record-tying 20 against Houston on May 6, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   He took a shutout in the ninth before allowing Alex Ochoa's solo
homer. The Reds are the only major league team that hasn't been
blanked this year.
</P>
<P>
   Wood had a ligament in his right elbow replaced on April 8,
1999, and since returning this season, his longest outing had been
eight innings on July 7 in a 4-2 loss to the Chicago White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Wood, the 1998 NL Rookie of the Year, won for the first time in
five starts since beating San Francisco on July 29. He was on the
disabled list from July 30 to Aug. 21 because of a muscle strain,
and was suspended Sept. 8-10 for his role in an Aug. 27 brawl
against Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   He retired his first 11 batters before Sean Casey doubled to
center. The Reds' other hits were singles by Chris Stynes in the
fifth and Juan Castro in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago stopped a four-game winning streak, winning for only the
second time in 12 games. The win was Don Baylor's 500th as a major
league manager. The first 440 were with Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Osvaldo Fernandez (2-3) allowed both runs -- one unearned -- and
five hits in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago went ahead in the first when Eric Young doubled on the
first pitch of the game, took third when Gary Matthews Jr.
sacrificed and scored when Fernandez threw past first for an error.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews hit an RBI groundout in the fifth that scored Augie
Ojeda, who singled leading off.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Cincinnati RHP Scott Williamson has two broken toes on his
right foot and will miss at least one start. Williamson (5-8) was
scheduled to pitch Wednesday against the Cubs. ... An MRI showed
Ken Griffey Jr. has a partial tear of his left hamstring. He is
expected to be out 5-7 games. ... C Eddie Taubensee was on the
Reds' bench for the first time since back surgery Friday. He said
the surgery was more extensive than expected, but that his back
already feels better. ... Sammy Sosa, who had a nine-game hitting
streak with four home runs in his previous five games, was 0-for-4.
He has a major league-leading 49 homers and needs just one to join
only Babe Ruth and Mark McGwire as the only players with more than
two 50-homer seasons.

<HEADLINE> Flyers, LeClair Fail To Reach Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VOORHEES, N.J. (AP) -- Talks between the Philadelphia Flyers and
John LeClair have broken down, leaving the star left wing in
position to become an unrestricted free agent after the season.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Flyers did make a tremendous offer. It was close, but in
all fairness, it wasn't what we were looking for and we didn't
think it was something I should sign,'' LeClair said after practice
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The team did not comment Tuesday, but general manager Bob Clarke
said Monday he was disappointed that the sides couldn't reach an
agreement. LeClair said he doubted that talks would resume during
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ''Talks are done and it's time to move on and play hockey,''
LeClair said. ''If they came up with an offer that would be
ridiculous to turn down, that's one thing. But I don't anticipate
that and I'm not going to sit around and hold my breath and wait
for something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   LeClair won the largest arbitration award in NHL history last
month, getting a one-year deal for $7 million. He made $3.96
million last season.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke has said LeClair was offered a four-year deal ''that goes
well beyond the value set by the arbitrator at $7 million.''
</P>
<P>
   LeClair said he still wants to stay in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no hard feelings on my part and I don't think on their
part,'' he said ''It's just part of the game, and it's not really
even part of hockey. It's the other part of the business that, as a
player, it's not a great thing to be involved in.''
</P>
<P>
   LeClair is one of the NHL's top goal-scorers and has been an
All-Star since joining the Flyers in 1995. He has an NHL-high 235
goals over the past five seasons.

<HEADLINE> Callaway Countersues Over Patent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) -- Callaway Golf has filed a counter
lawsuit against Bridgestone Sports in a dispute over the patent on
the popular Rule 35 golf ball.
</P>
<P>
   Callaway claimed in a suit filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court
in Atlanta that Bridgestone originally filed its patent
infringement suit against Callaway in order to stifle competition.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bridgestone has knowingly made unfounded claims of patent
infringement against us in an effort to undermine the successful
launch ... of our Rule 35 golf ball,'' Steve McCracken, Callaway's
chief legal officer, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Bridgestone Sports USA is the American subsidiary
of Tokyo-based Bridgestone Sports Co. and makes golf equipment
under its Precept Golf brand.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Bridgestone Sports USA did not return a phone
message left after business hours Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone's lawsuit said the company had denied Callaway's
request to license the technology covered by the patents but
Callaway released the Rule 35 anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Callaway denies infringing on any of Bridgestone's patents.
</P>
<P>
   Callaway officials sent Bridgestone two e-mails about the Rule
35 ball, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The first e-mail sent Jan. 5 alerted Bridgestone that Callaway
had finalized the Rule 35 ball and planned to introduce it in less
than a month, according to the countersuit.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail also said Callaway might ''want to use'' some
Bridgestone technology in future ball designs and that the
Carlsbad-based company was interested in discussing possible
licensing agreements.
</P>
<P>
   In a second e-mail, dated Jan. 19, Callaway officials told
Bridgestone that the Rule 25 was designed to ''avoid any possible
conflicts with (Bridgestone's) patents,'' the company said.

<HEADLINE> Knight Set To Move, Wants To Coach  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE HERMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- Bob Knight wants to coach again ''in
the worst way.'' He's just not sure where.
</P>
<P>
   Knight, fired by Indiana for a pattern of ''unacceptable''
behavior, said Tuesday night he was surprised by the school's
decision but that perhaps it was time to move on.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought I'd stay here till I was done coaching,'' Knight
told ESPN in a sometimes contentious interview broadcast live.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't retired. I'm an unemployed teacher right now, and
I'm looking for a place to teach. There are too many things that I
have yet to explore about the game of basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight said he had thought about leaving Indiana at times, but
his love of the basketball team was too strong. He had wanted the
Hoosiers, who haven't advanced past the second round of the NCAA
tournament since 1994, to become a powerhouse again.
</P>
<P>
   ''I kind of hung on to that thought for several years now, four
or five years, and probably should've gone somewhere else,'' he
said. ''And there would be somebody that was a better fit for this
administration and these people than I am. And there's a place for
me where there's a better fit for me as a basketball coach.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews on ESPN and in The Sporting News, the 59-year-old
Hall of Fame coach spoke about his future, and his dismissal Sunday
from a school where he won three national titles in three
tumultuous decades. He said he might accept an offer to help Isiah
Thomas, the former Hoosiers star now coaching the Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   Knight repeated that he did nothing wrong when he grabbed
freshman Kent Harvey by the arm last week to give him a lecture
about manners after the student said, ''Hey, what's up, Knight?''
The coach also disputed some of the other reasons university
president Myles Brand cited in firing him.
</P>
<P>
   Brand said Knight violated a zero-tolerance policy that had been
in place since May. But Knight said he was never told exactly what
''zero-tolerance'' meant, a claim university officials denied.
</P>
<P>
   Knight said one episode cited by Brand, verbal abuse of a
university lawyer, occurred during a meeting about the $30,000 fine
levied against him by Brand in May. But Knight said he never used
profanity and didn't raise his voice.
</P>
<P>
   After the ESPN interview, university officials said they stood
by Brand's earlier statements.
</P>
<P>
   ''I certainly think he did have a chance. In fact, his job was
saved by this administration in May and they gave him another
chance, a new lease on life,'' school trustee Stephen Backer said.
''It appears, from his own interview, that he was angry and
resentful, and instead of taking advantage of the opportunity, he
failed to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   University vice president Christopher Simpson added, ''I see
nothing productive at this juncture to get into a he-said,
she-said.''
</P>
<P>
   In The Sporting News interview, Knight said he was most sorry to
be leaving Bloomington because of all the golf, hunting and fishing
in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to move,'' Knight told the weekly newspaper,
referring to his wife, Karen. ''And that'll be difficult. I've been
here since 1971 and I really like the area. I can play golf, I can
catch 50 bluegill in an hour, I can go turkey hunting. The place
has fit my lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now that's all wiped out, and I feel worse about that than not
having the coaching job.''
</P>
<P>
   On ESPN, he often chastised interviewer Jeremy Schaap for what
he considered interruptions as he answered questions. At one point
he told Schaap, son of veteran sportswriter and broadcaster Dick
Schaap: ''You got a long way to go to be as good as your dad, you
better keep that in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight, replaced Tuesday by Indiana assistant Mike Davis, said
getting another coaching job is a priority, but he's not sure what
would be the best situation.
</P>
<P>
   ''People have called me. That's all I want to do. I want to
coach in the worst way,'' Knight told ESPN at a resort south of
Bloomington. ''I'm not right for every administration and every
administration's not right for me.''
</P>
<P>
   In July, he was contacted by Delaware about recommendations for
its head coaching job. Later, Knight said, he thought that he
perhaps should have asked about the job for himself. (The school
hired David Henderson, who had been a Duke assistant).
</P>
<P>
   ''Delaware really appealed to me,'' he told The Sporting News.
</P>
<P>
   Knight, nicknamed The General, was famous for his temper and
old-school discipline. No matter where he ends up, he said he won't
change his ways.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've always felt I've got to be me. I can't be something that
someone's trying to construct,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Pacers' job, Knight would be reunited with Thomas,
who led the 1981 Hoosiers to a national title. Thomas has invited
Knight to join him as an assistant coach, and Knight said he might
on a limited basis.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told him, 'All you have to do is ask. I don't know what kind
of commitment I want to make, but if you want me to come to
practice, evaluate players, do some scouting, just ask,''' Knight
told The Sporting News.
</P>
<P>
   Knight, who addressed a campus protest after he was fired, plans
to meet with students Wednesday at Dunn Meadow, which is near the
Student Union. The forum is sponsored by the school newspaper, the
Indiana Daily Student.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a time when I would never have dreamed that I'd
coach anywhere but Indiana University, but things have changed,''
Knight told The Sporting News. ''The leadership of this university
has changed. My inability to get along with the athletic director --
all that. I began to think, 'I've been here a long time.'''

<HEADLINE> 'Irrelevant Bowl' Upcoming This Week  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN WAWROW
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. -- This might be as far from Nebraska vs. Notre
Dame as you can get.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo, which has lost 17 straight, plays a Connecticut team
that entered its first Division I-A season ranked 114th out of 115
in one poll. The 115th school is none other than Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind on Tuesday, Buffalo coach Craig Cirbus changed
his upbeat, glass-is-half-full philosophical outlook, to a more
urgent approach.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're approaching Connecticut not with improvement, not with
looking good, not with being embarrassed in front of our fans,''
Cirbus said. ''We're going out there with one goal, and that is to
win the football game.''
</P>
<P>
   No more moral victories, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''No way, baby, we're in it to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Cirbus' Bulls have been a laughingstock since making the jump to
Division I-A a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Not only have they gone almost 30 years since beating a I-A
opponent (Holy Cross on Oct. 31, 1970), the Bulls haven't come
close to tasting victory. They've been outscored 122-7 in two games
this year and 215-28 in their last four outings. It's so bad that
Buffalo has gone 17 straight without even enjoying a halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we're battling, quite honestly, is an emotional deal
right now,'' Cirbus said. ''We were out of our league last year.
Now (the players) are carrying it over last year into this year.
And when bad things happen, it snowballs. We've got to get out of
that.
</P>
<P>
   ''The easiest way is a win.''
</P>
<P>
   A win won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   UConn, despite its brief I-A tenure, is no pushover.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies came a bad punt away from matching Eastern Michigan
in their season-opener, losing 32-25, and followed that up with
last weekend's 37-7 victory over I-AA Colgate.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut also has had the edge over Buffalo, going 4-0 over
the last five years, outscoring the Bulls by a combined margin of
124-28. In fact, the Huskies haven't allowed Buffalo a point in the
last 177 minutes, 17 seconds of play.
</P>
<P>
   The past means little to UConn coach Randy Edsall.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's their home opener and they're going to try to end the
streak against us. And we have to go in and learn to win on the
road,'' Edsall said. ''This is certainly no different than any
other game. We're not taking anything for granted. ... I see a
(Buffalo) team that's better than it was a year ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Cirbus can only hope. It's hard to tell after the outmatched
Bulls opened the season with a 63-7 loss to Syracuse and then fell
59-0 to Rutgers last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Bulls linebacker Chris Gray said the team isn't discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this game is going to be a big, big game for this
program,'' Gray said. ''Everybody's got hope. Nobody's let down
hope for the season. ... I think we're going to give UConn a good
welcome into Division I-A football.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifth-year tackle David Pruce shrugged when asked about this
being billed as ''The Irrelevant Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's only natural. We kind of come to expect that
negativity,'' Pruce said. ''That's fine, whatever, it doesn't
change what we have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Cirbus avoided the natural comparisons between the two programs
other than to say UConn -- because of its high-profile basketball
teams -- has an advantage over Buffalo in money and recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   A victory won't change that.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's important for us to get a win so that we win,'' Cirbus
said. ''Historical perspectives, how administrators feel and how
conferences compete, I couldn't care less.''

<HEADLINE> 34 Fla. Students Ingest Rat Poison  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Thirty-four middle-school students
apparently ingested rat poison that had been sprinkled on salsa,
authorities said Tuesday. Two seventh-graders were being
questioned.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen students were taken to emergency rooms for headaches,
stomach pains and nausea, but all were released, said Lt. Glenda
Hopkins, a spokeswoman for Jacksonville Fire-Rescue Department.
</P>
<P>
   Blood tests will be conducted to confirm what the students
ingested, but Shands Jacksonville hospital authorities said the
students apparently ingested small amounts of a rat poison called
Talon-G. It is fatal to humans only in large, repeated doses.
</P>
<P>
   Packets of rat poison had been spread around Paxson Middle
School to control a rodent problem.
</P>
<P>
   Principal Richard Scott said two seventh-grade students, ages 12
and 15, were being questioned by authorities about the incident.
Their names were being withheld.
</P>
<P>
   School officials did not elaborate on why the investigation
focused on the two students or a possible motive. ''As far as I
know, it was not because of a fight,'' Scott said.

<HEADLINE> Investor Gives $24M to Operas  </HEADLINE>
By GARY GENTILE
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- A high-tech investor is giving $24
million to the Los Angeles Opera and a Russian opera and ballet
company to fund permanent productions designed to travel the world.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto Vilar, a billionaire who has given millions to classical
music companies worldwide, said he is giving $14 million to the
Mariinsky Opera and Ballet of St. Petersburg, Russia. The company
will create two new operas or ballets a year for the next three
years, begin a young artists program and open a management office
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The gift also will be used for co-productions with the Los
Angeles Opera, headed by artistic director Placido Domingo.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am here because of my friendship and respect for Placido
Domingo,'' said Vilar, who will join the Los Angeles Opera's board
of directors.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Opera will receive $6 million for new
productions over three years, plus $1 million per year over four
years for a new program to find and train young singers, conductors
and other artists.
</P>
<P>
   Vilar and Domingo appeared at a press conference with Valery
Gergiev, director of the Mariinsky Theatre, home of the Kirov opera
and ballet companies. The three said the gift was intended was to
fund permanent productions that would pay for themselves by
traveling.
</P>
<P>
   ''When a production is great, is big, it really should go around
the world,'' Domingo said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Domingo announced that the LA Opera's 2001-02 season
will include the first Los Angeles performance of the Ring Cycle,
an epic series of four operas written by Richard Wagner. Production
of the lavish operas will be designed by Industrial Light &AMP; Magic,
the special effects studio owned by ''Star Wars'' creator George
Lucas.

<HEADLINE> Gore Skips Kiss at Democratic Bash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- They sang, they danced, they laughed and
they cried, but there was no reprise of ''the kiss.''
</P>
<P>
   Al and Tipper Gore headlined an $800,000 Democratic National
Committee fund-raiser Tuesday night with stars from the worlds of
entertainment and politics.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Bill Bradley, defeated by Gore during the
presidential primaries, took the stage before the music started to
add his support. ''Welcome to South Jersey,'' he shouted to the
Gores.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley then invited Gore to recreate ''the kiss,'' the
lingering smooch delivered to Tipper on the August night when he
collected the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Striding onstage, Gore played the moment but settled for a
demure kiss to her hand instead.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 10,000 Democratic activists were entertained by Cher,
Michael Bolton, David Brenner and Luther Vandross.
</P>
<P>
   The event was the opening bell in a week of money-raising by
Gore, who is set to raise $1 million on Wednesday in Boston, and $5
million later in the week in California.

<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Top Korean officials have agreed to
arrange a visit by North Korean leader Kim Jong Il to South Korea
next spring, a state news agency said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was reached late Tuesday by Kim Yong Sun, a
visiting envoy of the North Korean leader, and his South Korean
counterpart, Lim Dong-won, Yonhap news agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the two Koreas are expected to hold a first-ever
meeting of defense ministers to discuss tension-easing measures
late this month or early next month in Hong Kong, Yonhap said,
citing unnamed government officials.
</P>
<P>
   Seoul officials were not immediately available for comment. But
they had earlier said Kim Jong Il was expected to visit South Korea
next spring, at the latest.
</P>
<P>
   The North's envoy arrived in Seoul Monday via a direct air route
from Pyongyang for a four-day visit to discuss the visit by Kim
Jong Il and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, he flew to Cheju island off the southern tip of the
Korean Peninsula, which Kim Jong Il reportedly wanted to visit
during his planned South Korea trip.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Yong Sun and Lim, head of the National Intelligence Service
and special adviser to South Korean President Kim Dae-jung,
coordinated and sat in on the first-ever inter-Korea summit in
June.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Yong Sun plans to visit a steel mill and a historic city
Wednesday. He will wind up his visit Thursday after paying a
courtesy call on Kim Dae-jung.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Jong Il promised to visit Seoul in return for Kim Dae-jung's
visit to Pyongyang in June.
</P>
<P>
   His visit to South Korea would mark another milestone in decades
of Cold War relations between the two Koreas, which had been
divided into the communist North and the pro-Western South in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   The Koreas fought a three-year war in the early 1950s and have
never signed a peace treaty. Their border is the world's most
heavily fortified, with nearly 2 million troops deployed on both
sides.
</P>
<P>
   Inter-Korea relations have warmed significantly since the June
summit, during which their leaders pledged to put the past behind
and work together for peace.
</P>
<P>
   The Koreas have since stopped propaganda broadcasts against each
other and reopened border liaison offices. They allowed 200 people
to cross the border in August for temporary family reunions. Two
more reunions are scheduled before the year's end.
</P>
<P>
   In early September, South Korea repatriated 63 convicted North
Korean spies and guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The Koreas also have agreed to reconnect a cross-border railway
and let their athletes march together behind a unification flag
during the opening ceremonies at the Sydney Olympics.

Clinton Wins N.Y. Senate Primary
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton breezed past a little-known
challenger to win New York's Democratic Senate primary today. With 16 percent of
precincts reporting, Clinton had 71,714 votes or 78 percent and orthopedic
surgeon Mark McMahon had 20,481 votes or 22 percent. As nine states and the
District of Columbia held contests on the last big primary day of 2000, the
first lady built a wide lead over McMahon en route to her contest against
unopposed Republican Rep. Rick Lazio in November. With 16 percent of precincts
reporting, Clinton had 71,714 votes or 78 percent and McMahon had 20,481 votes

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Republican TV ad that flashes the word ''RATS'' across

subliminal message about Democart Al Gore. George W. Bush called the notion
''bizarre and weird,'' and his presidential campaign made light of it all. The
admaker said he was just trying to make the spot visually interesting. ''I've
never seen anything like it,'' said Gore. His running mate, Joseph Lieberman,
called the ad ''very disappointing and strange.''

   MIAMI (AP) -- A storm off the U.S. southeast gathered just enough strength
today to become Hurricane Florence. The storm has sustained winds of about 75
mph, the minimum necessary for a hurricane. By evening, it was centered about
330 miles south-southeast of Cape Hatteras, N.C. The storm is not expected to
pose any threat to the United States through Friday. A swimmer died at Kure
Beach, N.C., and eight others were rescued from strong rip currents that the
Coast Guard blamed on the storm system.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. announced today it will replace
the 1.4 million Firestone tires for which federal authorities issued a warning.
The company said it will replace the tires for free even if no defects are found
or reimburse up to $140 per tire for competitors' models. The National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration had issued a warning after the company refused to
expand a recall of 6.5 million tires.

Broad Tire Safety Powers Urged
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater today urged
Congress to give federal safety inspectors broad new powers because of the
Firestone tire case, including access to foreign data, manufacturer warranty
claims and insurance information. ''We must look to the future and guard against
any repetition of tragedy caused by defective vehicles or equipment,'' said
Slater, whose agency includes the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, which has been criticized for not investigating
Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. and Ford Motor Co. earlier.

<HEADLINE> Yankees 10, Blue Jays 2  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Jose Canseco went 3-for-3, hitting his 446th
career home run to lead Denny Neagle and the New York Yankees over
the Toronto Blue Jays 10-2 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Canseco drove in three runs and scored three as the Yankees won
for the 10th time in 13 games. The Blue Jays, who had won three in
a row, were blunted in their bid to move up in the AL wild card
race.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle (7-4) won his fourth straight start, pitching 7 2-3
effective innings. He gave up eight hits, struck out seven and,
with his father in the box seats, walked off to a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle was at his best in the fifth inning, right after Alex
Gonzalez hit an RBI single that made it 6-2 and left the bases
loaded with no outs.
</P>
<P>
   The lefty retired Chad Mottola on a tricky popup as first
baseman Tino Martinez made an over-the-shoulder catch when the ball
blew back fair in shallow right. Triple Crown candidate Carlos
Delgado then grounded into a double play started by Martinez, with
Neagle covering first.
</P>
<P>
   Canseco hit an RBI single in a three-run second that put the
Yankees ahead 4-1 against Joey Hamilton (2-1). In the fourth, he
lined a two-run homer into the left-field seats.
</P>
<P>
   Canseco's 15th homer of the season, and sixth for the Yankees,
put him six behind Carl Yastrzemski for 22nd place on the career
list.
</P>
<P>
   After singling in the sixth, Canseco drew an intentional walk
that loaded the bases with two outs in the seventh. Ryan Thompson,
making his first start of the season in center field for ailing
Bernie Williams, greeted reliever Roy Halladay with a three-run
double.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter walked and scored on David Justice's double in the
Yankees first. Chuck Knoblauch hit a two-run triple past Mottola,
who made an ill-advised dive for the ball in right field, in the
second.
</P>
<P>
   Mottola, the MVP of the Triple-A International League this
season, was the fifth player picked overall in the June 1992 draft.
Jeter was taken sixth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Williams did not play for the seventh time in eight games.
He has a sore right knee. ... RHP David Cone will start for the
Yankees on Friday night against Cleveland. He separated his left
shoulder catching a pop-up at Kansas City on Sept. 5. ... Neagle
was 8-2 with Cincinnati before being traded to the Yankees during
the All-Star break. ... Jeter's 12-game hitting streak ended. ...
Toronto 3B Tony Batista was hitless in four at-bats, leaving him in
a 6-for-70 slump. ... The Blue Jays signed a four-year deal with
the Auburn (N.Y.) Doubledays of the New York-Penn League. Toronto's
affiliate this year in the Class A league, the Queens Kings, will
become part of the New York Mets' farm system.

<HEADLINE> British Archer Slightly Cut  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- British archer Simon Needham is
sporting a slight nick on his chin, and it has nothing to do with
an errant arrow.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Needham was scraped when one bus struck another in the
Olympic Village -- the latest in a string of accidents that have
bedeviled the Olympic transportation system in the days before the
games begin.
</P>
<P>
   The accident in which Needham got nicked, which left one of the
buses with a broken windshield, was one of two reported Tuesday on
the Olympic bus network. The other involved a bus sideswiping a
parked car.
</P>
<P>
   Needham, 40, a Royal Marines vehicle mechanic, was scraped when
the bus he was riding to the archery venue rammed a parked bus that
had just dropped off the Australian team returning from archery.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could be a nick from shaving. It's just as if you had run
your fingernail over it,'' venue press manager Rowena Newcomen said
of the mark on Needham's chin. ''It didn't even bleed.''
</P>
<P>
   In the other accident, an Olympic bus on its way from the Media
Village to the Main Press Center sideswiped a parked car. The
accident held up the bus for 15 minutes, and the normal 30-minute
trip took about an hour because the driver also had trouble with
directions.
</P>
<P>
   There were other buses on which journalists had to direct
drivers, about half of whom have been recruited from areas outside
Sydney, to spots in the Olympic Park.
</P>
<P>
   ''As new drivers come on board, we take every step we can to
make sure they know where they are,'' said Paul Willoughby,
spokesman for the Olympic Roads and Transport Authority. ''But
there always will be car drivers and bus drivers that get lost.''
</P>
<P>
   There were more bus problems Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Buses shuttling athletes to various training areas were running
late Wednesday, leaving every 30-45 minutes or so instead of the
usual 10-15 minute interval, according to Graham Cassidy, spokesman
for Olympics Minister Michael Knight.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't say what the problem was but said the situation was
expected to return to normal later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest previous test for Sydney transit was in 1995 when
900 buses were used during a visit by Pope John Paul II. For the
Olympics, there will be 3,500 buses on the road during peak
periods.
</P>
<P>
   Trains also will be crowded. Olympic visitors will push the
number of passenger trips on the CityRail network from the normal
level of 14 million to about 34 million during the 19-day Olympic
period.
</P>
<P>
   Parking in the Sydney business district was banned beginning
Wednesday and an Olympic train schedule went into effect, with
officials promising a train running into Olympic Park station every
seven to eight minutes between early morning and late night.
</P>
<P>
   The start of the new train service did not go smoothly, however.
CityRail canceled three trains in the first hour of its Olympic
timetable -- leaving 60 commuters stranded for more than an hour
early Wednesday morning (Tuesday afternoon EDT) at Sydney's Central
Station.
</P>
<P>
   The Sydney Olympic transportation system has seen some notable
successes, such as a nearly flawless performance in taking 81,000
people to an opening ceremony dress rehearsal Saturday. But there
also have been some big goofs.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most attention-getting breakdowns took place last
weekend, when IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch canceled a tour
of the International Broadcast Center because a bus failed to show
at his hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Willoughby said he knows there will be comparisons to the 1996
Atlanta Games, which were plagued by transportation problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's impossible to run a transportation system of this
magnitude without some glitches,'' he said. ''I think it's
inevitable people will compare one host city with another. But
comparisons to Atlanta are limited. Sydney has quite a different
transport system than Atlanta.''

<HEADLINE> Drifter Goes On Trial for Murders  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE KOIDIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEL RIO, Texas (AP) -- A drifter who has confessed to 13 slayings
in seven states walked detectives through a grisly murder scene on
a videotape played in court Tuesday, coolly explaining how he
climbed through a mobile home window and slashed the throats of two
girls sleeping inside.
</P>
<P>
   One of the girls survived and fought back tears as she testified
in a trembling voice how Tommy Lynn Sells killed her friend and
then cut her throat.
</P>
<P>
   On the video, Sells said he drove up to the mobile home in the
early morning hours of Dec. 31 and then demonstrated how he climbed
through a window and walked around, peeking into each room.
</P>
<P>
   Sells said he used a ''big butcher knife'' to slit the victims'
throats while they were asleep before leaving through the front
door.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, the 36-year-old former carnival worker and
ex-convict pleaded guilty to attempted murder as he went on trial
for that crime and for the slaying of 13-year-old Kaylene Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sells has admitted killing Kaylene, he pleaded innocent
to the capital murder indictment accusing him of breaking into the
home to rape Kaylene. To secure a death sentence, prosecutors must
show that Sells committed another felony while killing her, such as
breaking and entering.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a very cruel crime, a very serious crime,'' Victor
Garcia, Sells' attorney, said as the trial began. ''But Tommy Lynn
Sells is going to tell you what he's guilty of, and it's not
capital murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaylene died, but her friend Krystal Surles, now 11, survived
with her vocal cords severed. She wrote down a description of the
attacker that led to Sells' arrest two days later.
</P>
<P>
   Krystal testified Tuesday that she tried to remain still and
silent but watched Sells' every move.
</P>
<P>
   ''He moved the knife and slit her throat,'' she said, wincing
and drawing sniffles from relatives, friends and neighbors in the
courtroom. ''She just fell. ... She turned and grabbed a poster and
fell.''
</P>
<P>
   Krystal said Sells then turned his attention to her, and she
begged him not to hurt her, promising not to say anything. But he
reached over and cut her throat, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Sells had befriended Kaylene's stepfather and
learned he would be out of town the night of the crime. Kaylene's
mother testified that she slept through the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Since his arrest, Sells has confessed to 13 slayings in seven
states, telling authorities that he used guns, knives, a bat, a
shovel, an ice pick and his bare hands, according to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   But some leads failed to pan out. An Arkansas man whom Sells
said he shot in 1982 was found unharmed. In Idaho, Sells led
investigators to a riverbank where he said he buried a woman in
1988, but no body was found.
</P>
<P>
   Sells has been charged in only one other case, the 1999 killing
of a 13-year-old Lexington, Ky., girl.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Ranger Sgt. John Allen said that in some of the other
confessions, Sells provided details only the killer would know.
Allen said Sells is a strong suspect in the murders of a 9-year-old
San Antonio girl last year; a Tucson, Ariz., man in 1988; and an
Illinois family of four in 1987.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox 8, Indians 6  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Dante Bichette hit a two-run homer in the third
when Chuck Finley had one of his typical one-inning meltdowns, and
the Boston Red Sox gained in the AL wild card race Tuesday night
with an 8-6 win over the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first of eight games in 10 days between the Red Sox
and Indians, who have met three times in the postseason since 1995
and don't like each other. In the past two years they've traded
wins, punches and brushback pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Bichette's homer capped Boston's six-run third off Finley
(12-11) and the Red Sox hung on to pull within two games of
Cleveland for the final playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   Nomar Garciaparra, who entered the series batting just .133 this
season against Cleveland, drove in two runs for Boston. Jose
Offerman and Carl Everett also had two RBIs apiece as the Red Sox
2-5 hitters drove in all their runs.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Martinez (10-6) pitched into the sixth, and three
relievers combined for three perfect innings. Derek Lowe got his
33rd save but only after allowing Travis Fryman's double and
Russell Branyon's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Manny Ramirez hit a two-run homer and had four RBIs for the
Indians, who thanks to Finley, trailed 6-1 after three innings.
</P>
<P>
   Finley needed just 27 pitches to get past the first two innings,
but it ook him 26 to get out of a disastrous third. That's been a
familiar pattern this season for Finley, signed this winter to a
$27 million, three-year contract to pitch in big games like this.
</P>
<P>
   In 30 starts this season, Finley has had 12 innings in which he
has given up three or more runs.
</P>
<P>
   Bichette's third homer since joining the Red Sox on Aug. 31
capped Boston's third against Finley, who got himself into trouble
by walking No. 9 hitter Manny Alexander on four pitches with one
out.
</P>
<P>
   Offerman and Everett hit RBI singles before Garciaparra's
two-run single put the Red Sox ahead 4-1. Bichette then hit a 2-1
pitch from Finley onto the home-run porch in left.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians loaded the bases with none out in the third, and
scored two runs, the first on a gift when Everett let Roberto
Alomar's fly ball drop in. Sandy Alomar scored on the play, but
Garciaparra easily threw out Lofton at home.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 6-3, Roberto Alomar led off the sixth with a double off
Martinez and Ramirez followed his 28th homer.
Notes: Ramirez's 226th homer tied Hall of Famer Earl Averill for
third on the team's career list. ... The Indians went 0-for-5 in
coin tosses conducted Tuesday by the commissioner's office to
determine the sites for potential playoff games if there is a tie
for the AL wild card. ... Cleveland's 444th consecutive sellout
pushed the Indians over 3 million in attendance for the fifth
straight year. ... The Martinez brothers -- Ramon and Pedro -- are a
combined 26-11 this season. The rest of Boston's starters are
27-36. ... Garciaparra has two hits or more in seven of his last 10
games. ... The Red Sox have scored 120 runs in the third inning
this season. Their next closest is 82 runs in the eighth.

<HEADLINE> Jazz Saxophonist, Turrentine Dies  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stanley Turrentine, a jazz saxophonist whose hit
''Sugar'' established him in the popular mainstream and influenced
musicians in many other genres, died Tuesday. He was 66.
</P>
<P>
   Turrentine died at a New York hospital two days after suffering
a stroke, said his agent, Robin Burgess. He lived in Fort
Washington, Md., outside Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Turrentine, who played tenor saxophone, mixed jazz with blues,
rock, rhythm and blues and pop.
</P>
<P>
   ''His impact on jazz was just astonishing,'' Burgess said. ''He
had a large impact on fusion, electric jazz and organ trio music.''
</P>
<P>
   Turrentine started his career playing with Ray Charles and Max
Roach. He scored his biggest hit in 1970 with ''Sugar,'' which
became something of a jazz standard, frequently performed and
re-recorded by admirers.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in Pittsburgh, surrounded by music. The piano player
Ahmad Jamal lived nearby, and often visited to practice on the
Turrentines' upright piano. Stanley's mother played piano, his
father played tenor sax and his brother Tommy played trumpet. The
brothers played at the Perry Bar in Pittsburgh, their first
professional gig, while they were still in high school, and often
performed together as adults.
</P>
<P>
   Turrentine began traveling with a band when he was 16, and later
joined one of Charles' early rhythm and blues groups. He played in
a jazz band headed by Roach and replaced the departing John
Coltrane in Earl Bostic's band.
</P>
<P>
   Turrentine went solo in the 1960s. His blues-influenced riffs
brought him commercial success with albums such as ''Stan 'The Man'
Turrentine,'' ''Up at Minton's,'' and ''Never Let Me Go.'' When
''Sugar'' brought him fame outside the jazz world, some fellow
musicians accused him of abandoning artistry to pander to popular
taste.
</P>
<P>
   He said he preferred mixing genres to being boxed in.
</P>
<P>
   ''One day, my stepson and I were alphabetizing my albums over
the years, and I noticed that they categorized me as a rock and
roll player on certain albums, a bee-bop player on other albums, a
pop player, a fusion player,'' he once said. ''And I'm just saying
... 'Gee, I'm just playing with different settings, but I'm still
playing the same way.'''

<HEADLINE> IOC Warned Of Scandal Documents  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Salt Lake City organizers warned the
IOC to brace for the release of a flood of potentially embarrassing
documents related to the Olympics' biggest corruption scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Angry International Olympic Committee members demanded that Salt
Lake officials stop the public release of any documents that would
slur their reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake Organizing Committee president Mitt Romney said state
laws and SLOC rules require him to release all documents connected
with the bribery scandal surrounding the city's winning bid for the
2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   Romney said he was aware of 400 boxes of files in the hands of
government investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not sure everything in those boxes will be accurate or
fair,'' he said. ''I apologize for any pain or hurt that these
documents will cause. I want you to recognize I didn't write them
or (other current SLOC officials) write them. I share your outrage
they were written in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Romney's report to the IOC general assembly Wednesday (Tuesday
night EDT) on preparations for the games turned into an
extraordinary debate reflecting the continuing deep-seated
bitterness of IOC members toward Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   The center of controversy was the so-called ''geld'' document, a
dossier compiled by Salt Lake bid leaders which listed personal
habits, loyalties and family needs of IOC members. The word
''geld,'' which means money in German, was written next to the
names of several IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, some IOC members threatened to sue Salt Lake
organizers for libel over the document.
</P>
<P>
   Bid committee operations were led by former SLOC president Tom
Welch and Dave Johnson, who were charged in July with 15 felony
counts of conspiracy, racketeering and fraud for providing more
than $1 million in cash and gifts to IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   Romney, in his report to the assembly, said government
investigators have turned over ''thousands and thousands of pages''
of files to Welch and Johnson. He said it's likely the defendants
will release the material as they try to clear their name.
</P>
<P>
   ''The defendants will be making their defense, will be making
accusations in other directions, saying they were not to blame,
others were to blame,'' Romney said. ''I can only imagine their
fingers will be pointed in many directions, and many people will
feel wronged.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Under our laws all of the records and documents will be made
public,'' he said. ''The 'geld' document is only one of the
literally thousands and thousands of pages of written material of
heaven knows what. I can't imagine what people have written. All of
this will become public.''
</P>
<P>
   The document was retrieved under a subpoena in the U.S. Justice
Department's grand jury investigation of the scandal. The memo was
found on the hard drive of the computer of Johnson, the No. 2
official in the bid and former deputy of the organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
   It was released publicly four months ago. Romney said it was
better to release the information rather than ''trying to hide and
cover up.''
</P>
<P>
   IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch said he was concerned the
continuing release of documents would disturb the games.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are worried that you said there are thousands of boxes and
boxes that can be opened in the near future,'' he said. ''That
means that during the Olympic Games in 2002 this problem will not
be finished. It will go on. I can imagine that during the Olympic
Games in Salt Lake another 'geld' document could be published. That
will make a bad image not only for the IOC but also for the games
in Salt Lake City.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking later at a news conference, Romney said SLOC believes
the trial of Welch and Johnson will be over by the time of the
games in February 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch suggested the IOC find a way to respond to any false
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to understand the members of the IOC cannot be happy
to read in the press comments, papers and so on that are not
true,'' he said. ''I am very much worried that this problem can go
on and on and on.''
</P>
<P>
   Romney told reporters SLOC would be ''responsive'' to
Samaranch's request to screen the documents for false information
in advance of their release.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are legitimate concerns that factual errors and
inaccuracies can be corrected prior to being headlined around the
world,'' Romney said.
</P>
<P>
   Romney said he hoped the documents would be issued as quickly as
possible so IOC members would not have to ''endure a water
torture'' of files being released over months or years.
</P>
<P>
   Julio Maglione, the IOC member from Uruguay, said SLOC had
failed to solve the ''moral debt'' caused by the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to know: Why did this happen?'' he said. ''Why, once
again, did we have to reopen issues that we thought had been
overcome? Facts like these cause deep harm to a movement that we
are convinced is based on profound ethical and moral values.''
</P>
<P>
   Maglione called for a motion to prevent the release of
documents. But Romney reiterated he was powerless to stop the
release.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't satisfy Maglione.
</P>
<P>
   ''You cannot just issue any piece of paper,'' he said. ''That's
not democracy, that's not freedom. Many roads based on good
intentions lead to hell. Excessive liberty and excessive freedom
leads to scandal that is not of any use to anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Keba Mbaye, chairman of the IOC ethics commission, who had
raised the possibility of legal action, said, if the documents are
released, it should be done by the government and not SLOC.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem is not whether to issue or not to issue (the
documents),'' Greek member Lambis Nikolaou said. ''The question is:
Why was this done? On the basis of what rights have they got into
the private lives of IOC members? We're talking about slurs.''

<HEADLINE> Notes From Tuesday's Baseball Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
Orioles-Rangers:
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: With the four-game series at Texas, the Orioles will
complete a 13-game road trip during which they will play in four
cities, had two day games after night games, and switched time
zones three times. ... Entering Tuesday's doubleheader, Orioles
relievers had 22 blown saves and a league high 5.69 ERA. But
Baltimore's bullpen has been better lately, converting 18 of 21
save opportunities since June 27.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: Rookie 3B Mike Lamb began the doubleheader with a
team-high 26 errors, but none in 12 games. The Rangers have been
encouraging Lamb to react to grounders rather than thinking first
and then reacting. ... The Rangers will honor the U.S. Little
League champions from Bellaire, Texas, prior to Sunday's game
against Kansas City. The team, which lost to Venezuela in the
finals, will be recognized before the game.
Red Sox-Indians:
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: The Red Sox and Indians have developed a testy rivalry
the past few years, fueled by three postseason meetings since 1995,
Pedro Martinez hitting Roberto Alomar earlier this year, and Boston
manager Jimy Williams insisting the Indians cover a center-field
camera he felt they were using to steal signals. ''We've played
them a lot of times the last couple years,'' Williams said. ''We've
played them a lot of different games with a lot of different
cameras involved.'' ... Eight games in the next 10 days against the
wild-card leading Indians might determine whether or not the Red
Sox make the playoffs. ''You'll know where we stand next Thursday,
if we're in or we're out,'' closer Derek Lowe said. ''So there's
nothing to be afraid of.'' ... After batting .451 with five homers
and 17 RBIs against Cleveland last season, SS Nomar Garciaparra
entered the three-game series hitting just .133 with five
strikeouts and one RBI this season.
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: Pedro Martinez's 8-0 career record and 1.47 ERA
against the Indians hasn't stopped manager Charlie Manuel from
believing Cleveland's due to defeat the AL's best pitcher. ''Our
time is coming,'' Manuel said. ''I hope he can't keep going on
beating us all the time. I think one of these days we're going to
have our day and we're going to get him.'' Martinez will face the
Indians on Thursday. ... Manuel doesn't think the importance of the
next two weeks would necessarily prevent the Red Sox and Indians --
who have brawled in the past -- from going at it again. ''It might
be more apt to happen because these games mean so much,'' he said.
Martinez was suspended five games in May after ignoring an umpire's
warning and hitting Roberto Alomar. ''I think that's history,''
Manuel said. ''Until somebody opens it back up.'' ... RHP Charles
Nagy, out since May 19 after undergoing elbow surgery, will start
Thursday's series finale. In 18 career starts against the Red Sox,
Nagy is 10-2 with a 2.96 ERA.
Blue Jays-Yankees:
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: 3B Tony Batista was stuck in a 9-for-66 slump over 16
games. ... 1B Brad Fullmer had homered in a career-high three
straight games.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: CF Bernie Williams again was out of the starting
lineup, this time because of a sore right knee. He did not play in
six of the Yankees' previous seven games. ... Chuck Knoblauch, who
began the night in a 1-for-18 slump since coming off the DL, drew a
leadoff walk in the first inning and hit a two-run triple in the
second. ... Denny Neagle's only other start against Toronto came on
Oct. 4, 1991, when he was a rookie with Minnesota.
Tigers-White Sox:
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: OF Juan Gonzalez has struggled in three games since
coming back from the flu. ''He's lost at the plate right now,''
manager Phil Garner said of Gonzalez's 1-for-12 skid. Gonzalez was
called out on strikes in the first inning Tuesday night and became
upset with home plate umpire Rich Rieker before Garner came out to
intercede. ... The Tigers have lost valuable ground in their
improbable wild-card chase by losing six straight after making a
second-half charge. ... The Tigers will send six minor leaguers to
the Arizona Fall League next month -- Brandon Inge, Omar Infante,
Mike Maroth, Adam Pettyjohn, Matt Miller and Kris Keller will join
the Scottsdale Scorpions. ... The Tigers announced a two-year
agreement Tuesday with the Erie SeaWolves of the Eastern League to
be their new Double-A affiliate. The Tigers' Double-A franchise has
been in Jacksonville, Fla., the last six years.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: When the White Sox began to stretch Tuesday about two
hours and 30 minutes before the game, they looked up on the
scoreboard and to their surprise the replay screen was showing -- in
slow motion -- their April brawl with the Tigers. While the players
watched, the agitated coaches called the scoreboard booth to get it
turned off. ''That surprised me, maybe it was somebody who didn't
understand,'' White Sox manager Jerry Manuel said. ''Who put it
up?'' asked general manager Ron Schueler, when told about the
incident minutes later. ''That's not real smart.'' ... Manuel hopes
to rest SS Jose Valentin as much as possible during the final three
weeks, but not for long periods. Valentin, who didn't start Tuesday
night, has been nursing an inflamed pelvis. ... RHP Cal Eldred,
with a screw in his ailing elbow, might try to play catch
Wednesday. James Baldwin, who had an injection Saturday in his sore
right shoulder, isn't sure if he will be able to throw Wednesday or
wait till later. ... The White Sox recalled left-handed reliever
Jesus Pena from Double-A Birmingham.
Twins-Athletics:
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: RHP Danny Mota was recalled from Salt Lake City of
the Pacific Coast League to replace RHP Hector Carrasco on the
roster. Carrasco was traded to Boston on Sunday. Mota was 5-3 with
a 2.19 ERA in 57 combined games for Salt Lake City, Double-A New
Britain and Single-A Fort Myers. He has 97 strikeouts in 82 1-3
innings with eight saves. Mota, acquired in the Feb. 6, 1998, trade
for Chuck Knoblauch, will be making his major league debut. ... LHP
Mark Redman underwent an MRI on Monday, which showed nothing out of
the ordinary. He has a bone bruise in his left knee and is expected
to miss at least one start. ... Twins CEO Chris Clouser was in
attendance at Tuesday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: 3B Olmedo Saenz is getting closer to returning to
action. He took batting practice for the first time since Aug. 30,
when he reinjured his strained left hamstring during a rehab
assignment with Triple-A Sacramento. Saenz has been on the 15-day
DL since Aug. 1, but could return as early as Friday when the A's
travel to Seattle for a crucial series. ... 2B Randy Velarde was
given a day off Tuesday. ... SS Miguel Tejada has already set
single-season highs for homers (25) and RBIs (98) for shortstops in
franchise history. Eddie Joost hit 23 homers in 1949, and Eric
McNair drove in 95 runs in 1932. Tejada entered Tuesday 8-for-53.
Devil Rays-Angels:
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: The Devil Rays, who did not draw a walk in their
four-game series at Oakland, entered Tuesday with a streak of 147
consecutive at-bats since Fred McGriff's one-out walk in the fifth
inning last Thursday at Cleveland. ... McGriff, mired in a 13-game
RBI drought, is six shy of his fifth career 100-RBI season. He
needs two homers to join Frank Robinson as the only players in
major league history to hit at least 200 homers in both leagues.
... 3B Vinny Castilla, who was never on the DL in nine major league
seasons before this year, has been placed on the DL three times in
his first season with the Devil Rays -- costing him 63 games.
Castilla, 33, sat out only nine games in four previous seasons
combined. ... The Devil Rays, whose only run in their last three
games came on Gerald Williams' RBI double in the sixth Monday at
Oakland, have hit only five homers in 15 games. ... Greg Vaughn
needs four homers to join McGriff and Jose Canseco as the only
players in major league history to hit at least 30 homers with four
different teams. ... Castilla, who hit at least 32 home runs in
each of five previous seasons with Colorado, has gone 141 at-bats
without a homer -- the longest drought of his career -- and has only
one in 216 previous at-bats. ... Roberto Hernandez needs one save
to reach the 30-save mark for the fifth time in his career, and two
to give him 100 with the Devil Rays. ... Tampa Bay has not allowed
a pinch-homer in 58 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: Mo Vaughn's career-high 160 strikeouts are the most by
any player in the Angels' 40-year history. The previous high was
156 in 1982 by Reggie Jackson. ... Vaughn, Troy Glaus and Tim
Salmon have combined to strike out 430 times, more than half of six
other teams. ... Salmon needs to score three runs to give the
Angels three players with at least 100 runs scored for the fourth
time. ... Darin Erstad needs eight RBIs to become the first player
in franchise history with 100 RBIs, 100 runs scored and 200 hits in
the same season. ... Scott Schoeneweis' balk in Monday night's loss
to Baltimore was the 10th by the Angels' staff, most in the majors.
Royals-Mariners:
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: Rey Sanchez ranks second among AL shortstops with a
.993 fielding percentage. He's made four errors in 600 chances of
128 games. Cleveland's Omar Vizquel is first with a .997 fielding
percentage with two errors in 576 chances. ... Since the All-Star
break, Johnny Damon is hitting .429 (109-for-254) and has scored 59
runs. He leads the AL in total bases in the second half of the
season with 163. ... All-Star RF Jermaine Dye has 32 home runs,
four shy of the team record of 36 set by Steve Balboni in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: With a 42-30 record at Safeco Field, the Mariners have
ensured their 11th winning season at home. ... The Mariners have
the lowest pinch-hitting average in the AL at .183 (15-for-82).
Raul Ibanez had a pinch-single in a 6-3 loss to the Royals on
Monday night. ... LF Rickey Henderson (bruised left hip) and 2B
Mark McLemore (strained left hamstring) were not in Tuesday's
lineup. McLemore left after five innings Monday night.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Brewers-Mets:
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: With starting catcher Henry Blanco slowed by a sore
right shoulder, the Brewers purchased the contract of C Kevin Brown
from Triple-A Indianapolis. To make room, they moved pitcher Rocky
Coppinger from the 15-day to the 60-day DL. ... Starter John Snyder
pitched a scoreless first inning for the sixth straight start. He
allowed 19 first-inning runs in his first 15 starts this season.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Manager Bobby Valentine played coy when asked about
his team's health. ''We have a little situation, I'd rather not
talk about.'' That situation is a sore right foot for closer
Armando Benitez, limiting his ability to push off the mound.
Benitez, who allowed one earned run between June 22-Sept. 5, has
given up three runs and two homers in his last two outings. ... C
Mike Piazza, just 5-for-30 with two RBIs this month, did not start.
The team as a whole is hitting just .201 with 30 runs in 10
September games. ''It's not only myself. It's been everybody,''
Piazza said. ''It just shows how frustrating this game can be.''
... 3B Robin Ventura returned to the lineup after two days off and
singled in his first at-bat, snapping an 0-for-23 slump.
Marlins-Braves:
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: Entering Tuesday, LF Cliff Floyd and 3B Mike Lowell had
done the most damage to Braves pitching this season. Floyd was
hitting .300 (9-for-30) with three homers and 10 RBIs, while Lowell
hit .323 batting average (10-for-31) with three homers and nine
RBI. ... C Ramon Castro was hit in the head with Andruw Jones' bat
in the third inning, but remained in the game. ... One reason the
Marlins entered with a 5-4 record against Atlanta this year was a
.290 average against the Braves. Only Montreal's .302 was better.
... Lynn Jones will replace Rusty Kuntz as first base coach next
year. A former utility man for the Detroit Tigers and Kansas City
Royals, Jones spent eight years in the Marlins' organization. He
guided Triple-A Calgary to a 60-82 record this year. Kuntz will
remain in the organization as a roving outfield and baserunning
instructor.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: After compiling a 9.82 ERA in 11 innings, RHP Stan
Belinda called it quits Tuesday. Belinda, 0-0 with no save
opportunities, was signed July 29 after being released by Colorado.
He had 2.79 ERA in 12 appearances in April, but left the Rockies
with a 7.07 ERA in 46 appearances. Belinda said he will try to
return to baseball next year with another club. ... Facing Jesus
Sanchez, SS Rafael Furcal hit from the right side, where he was
batting .257 (18-for-70). Furcal had a .300 average (93-for-310)
against right-handers. ... LHP John Rocker last walked a batter on
Aug. 16 against San Diego, giving the closer a stretch of nine
games and 9 1-3 innings without issuing a pass. For the year,
Rocker has walked 45 in only 46 1-3 innings. ... RF Brian Jordan is
hitting .440 against left-handers, best in the majors.
Expos-Phillies:
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: The Expos set a team record on Tuesday by adding its
49th player of the season, purchasing the contract of C Yohanny
Valera from Double-A Harrisburg. Valera takes the spot of Michael
Barrett, who is suffering from tendinitis of the right elbow and is
day-to-day. ... Wednesday night's starter, LHP Trey Moore, has had
great difficulty against left-handed batters, who are .459 against
him (17-for-37).
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: On Wednesday night, LHP Bruce Chen will look to
extend his scoreless innings streak which is at 20 2-3 innings. The
last time he surrendered a run was in the third inning against San
Francisco on Aug. 27. ... Leading hitter Bobby Abreu (.316), who
left game 2 of Monday's doubleheader with inflammation of the right
elbow, did not start Tuesday and is listed as day-to-day.
Cardinals-Pirates:
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: Mark McGwire got a new position Tuesday. He led off
and was officially listed as the starting left fielder. McGwire was
the Cardinals' No. 2 hitter and second baseman for the past four
games. Of course, his defensive position is purely a technicality
since McGwire is in the game to make one plate appearance, then
give way to the normal starter at that position. He was replaced by
Craig Paquette in the bottom of the inning. McGwire hit a ground
ball to shortstop against Dan Serafini, and was clearly favoring
his aching right knee when he came off the field. ... Thomas Howard
has an overall average of .197, but is a .324 hitter with runners
in scoring position. He's 12-for-37 with runners in scoring
position and 12-for-85 (.141) with none on base. Howard picked up
his 10th RBI as a pinch-hitter with a double in Monday's 8-4 win
over the Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: Kevin Young took some grounders at first base
Tuesday, He has missed the last 14 games with a groin strain. Young
hopes to play this weekend in Houston. ... John Vander Wal forced
his way into the lineup with his steady production. Vander Wal
drove in all four of the Pirates' runs Monday, raising his season
total to 79. He hit his 20th homer in the game. The Pirates want to
look at younger players, but the 34-year-old Vander Wal has been
too productive to keep on the bench.
Cubs-Reds:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: RF Sammy Sosa has a nine-game hitting streak, with four
home runs in five games, and 49 homers for the season. He needs one
HR to join Babe Ruth and Mark McGwire as the only players with more
than two 50-homer seasons. ... Don Baylor got his 500th win as a
big-league manager Tuesday. The first 440 were with Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: An MRI showed that CF Ken Griffey Jr. has a partial
tear of his left hamstring, the result of a collision Monday night
with Cubs C Joe Girardi. He is expected to be out 5-7 games. ... C
Eddie Taubensee was on the bench for the first time since back
surgery on a bulging disk last Friday. He said the surgery was more
extensive than expected, but that his back already feels better.
Giants-Astros:
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: The Giants' lead of 8 1-2 games over Arizona is
their widest September lead in a division race since Sept. 19,
1987, when they were nine games in front of Cincinnati. ... The
Giants' 207 home runs are their most while playing in San
Francisco, and they are on pace to hit 235, which would top the
franchise mark of 221 set in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: With a loss Monday night, the Astros were
mathematically eliminated from the NL Central Division as they are
20 games out with 18 to play. ... Houston has used 23 pitchers this
year, tying the club record set in 1965. The Astros also have used
43 total players, five short of the record set in 1965.
Dodgers-Diamondbacks:
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: Gary Sheffield needs two homers to match the
Dodgers' franchise record for homers in a season. ... RHP Ismael
Valdes dropped his appeal and began serving his six-game suspension
Tuesday. Valdes was suspended for hitting Chicago's Mark Grace on
Aug. 27. ... C Todd Hundley is hitting .308 with 21 homers and 57
RBIs in his last 66 games. ... Jeff Shaw is 12-for-12 in save
opportunities since coming off the DL July 13. ... Los Angeles' 40
road wins lead the NL. The Dodgers are 40-36 away from Chavez
Ravine.
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: After winning his first three decisions with the
Diamondbacks, RHP Curt Schilling has lost five of his last six.
Schilling hasn't won since Aug. 18 against Chicago. ... The
Diamondbacks are 1-54 when trailing after eight innings and 2-49
when trailing after seven. ... Arizona has been held to four runs
or less in seven straight games and has managed just 44 hits during
that stretch. ... Diamondbacks play-by-play man Thom Brennaman, son
of Cincinnati Reds' broadcaster Marty Brennaman, turned 37 on
Tuesday. ... Jason Conti on Monday became the 34th player in
Diamondbacks history to homer. ... Arizona has homered in four
straight games, its longest streak since homering in seven straight
games from June 25 to July 1.
Rockies-Padres:
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: The defeat of Julian Tavarez in Monday's 7-2 loss
snapped his club record of nine consecutive winning decisions. ...
3B Jeff Cirillo needs four more doubles to join Todd Helton (54) as
only the sixth pair of teammates to record 50-plus doubles in the
same season. Helton is only 10 behind Joe Medwick's NL record of 64
set in 1936 and eight shy of the NL mark for left-handers, set by
Pittsburgh's Paul Waner in 1932.
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: Ryan Klesko, who stole his 21st base Monday night, is
the only NL 1B to reach the 20-steal mark this season. ... In the
last two starts of rookie RHP Adam Eaton, Wednesday's scheduled
starter, the games have each lasted 13 innings and took more than
four hours to complete.

<HEADLINE> Sharks, Crocs Are Aussie Icons  </HEADLINE>
By MORT ROSENBLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The truth about the dreaded S-word is
that Australians eat far more sharks than sharks eat Australians.
</P>
<P>
   And in regard to potential ''Jaws'' incidents among triathlon
swimmers in the early spring chill of Sydney Harbor, forget about
it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not a chance,'' said shark expert Giles Macleay, chuckling,
when asked about the odd Olympic bite. After five years of closely
studying great whites in South Australia, he would know.
</P>
<P>
   ''Look,'' he said, ''with all those swimmers in the water, the
officials' boats, all the spectator noise, you think any shark in
his right mind would hang around anywhere close?''
</P>
<P>
   Macleay was among those who tested special pods that divers will
carry among triathlon competitors, just in case, emitting pulses to
render the underwater vicinity user-unfriendly to large fish.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a bit of a joke, really,'' he said. ''Mainly, it's just
to make people feel better.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharks are not necessarily funny in Australian waters. They kill
an average of one person a year. But bees and lightning bolts each
account for more deaths, and so do crocodiles.
</P>
<P>
   In the Sydney area, Marisa Hathaway was the last to succumb to a
shark back in 1963, and that was because she bled to death while
waiting for a delayed ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   Only five of the world's 375 or so species of shark are
considered dangerous to humans -- most far prefer fish -- and of
those, only the bronze whaler frequents Sydney waters.
</P>
<P>
   The famous nets off the beaches are only pockets of mesh along a
120-mile strip. They catch resident sharks, which circle around in
one area, but a passer-by can slip through the gaps for an easy
lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the danger is greater from white sharks off Mexico
or other species in southern U.S. waters. A bull shark killed a
swimmer off Florida last month.
</P>
<P>
   In Sydney, sharks are most visible as long strips of white
fillet, marked ''flake,'' in any decent fish market.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you call it shark, people won't touch it,'' said Steve
Khaouli, a broker at Sydney's huge Fish Market. ''As flake, it
sells great.'' At $4 a pound, it is half the price of salmon, but
twice as much as sea mullet.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love the stuff,'' exults Rob Griffith, a local gourmet who
steams it in herbs, bakes it with lemon butter and fries it in
batter or with sweet chili teriyaki sauce. ''It's tender, firm,
tasty, boneless and not oily.''
</P>
<P>
   Only smaller sharks are sold to be cut up into flake, mostly
because fishermen are not eager to wrestle to the death a half-ton
monster on the rolling deck of a boat. But fishing nets still take
a huge toll.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say 30,000 tons of gray nurse sharks are caught each
year and thrown back, mostly to die. The gray nurse joined the
worldwide endangered species list in 1999, along with the great
white.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, marine researchers say, more than 100 million sharks
are caught each year by crews from 125 countries, but only
Australia, New Zealand, the United States and Canada have efficient
controls.
</P>
<P>
   Huge numbers are killed for their distinctive dorsal, the vital
ingredient for Chinese shark's fin soup. Crews hack off the fins
and toss the rest overboard.
</P>
<P>
   ''Game fishing is a particular problem down here,'' Macleay
said. ''People just love to hang a big set of jaws on their wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Macleay saw ''Jaws'' at the age of 8 and had nightmares like
everyone else. Growing into his career as a marine specialist at
the Sydney Aquarium, however, he eventually shook off his early
fears.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he dives into the tanks to hand-deliver dinner to sharks in
the impressive aquariums at Darling Harbor and nearby Manly.
</P>
<P>
   ''Actually, our seals are a lot more dangerous, with a bite like
a dog or a bear,'' he said. ''But sharks suffer from
misinformation. They look so mean, and there is nothing cuddly
about them.''
</P>
<P>
   There was the time Macleay needed eight stitches because a gray
nurse in the aquarium decided his hand was part of the menu at
feeding time. But he blames himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was like a carpenter banging his finger with a hammer,''
he said, with a shrug. ''Some days you're not on the ball, and he
is.''
</P>
<P>
   The aquarium sharks are fed three times a week so they don't
snack on their neighbors. In the open ocean, a big shark can go for
a week between one decent meal and another.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers believe it is fairly safe to swim among great
whites, Macleay said, although no one is hurrying to test the
theory in person.
</P>
<P>
   In Australia, at least, people and sharks cohabit just fine. If
an exaggerated threat might keep some visitors away, the attraction
of it brings others.
</P>
<P>
   And in any case, sharks, like crocs, are an Australian icon.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Sydney Aquarium, a large poster placates fears by
pointing out how many more victims die in traffic accidents than in
the ocean. As the visitors exit, however, they walk smack into the
Shark Bite Cafe.

<HEADLINE> Power Outage, Storm Disrupts Travel  </HEADLINE>
By TRACI GRIFFITH
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Hundreds of Continental flights were delayed
Tuesday evening because of a Texas power outage while hundreds of
people at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago scrambled to
salvage travel plans disrupted by an earlier storm.
</P>
<P>
   The temporary outage at Continental's main operations center in
Houston scrambled computers handling the flow of air traffic. The
airline said 300 to 400 flights across the country would be
affected.
</P>
<P>
   Continental has hubs at Cleveland, Houston and Newark. N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Chicago Department of Aviation spokeswoman Monique
Bond said more than 100 flights were canceled at O'Hare by midday
Tuesday and more delays were possible. She said 368 flights were
canceled Monday during the height of a powerful storm that saw
winds of up to 50 mph.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hare handles about 2,400 flights daily.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Malek, 20, was on his way to Uruguay when he was trapped in
Chicago by Monday's storm. He spent the night in the airport, along
with hundreds of other stranded passengers, but United Airlines ran
out of cots, so he slept on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmad Brunson, on his way to Greensboro, N.C., through Chicago,
said the plane sat on the runway for more than an hour while it
waited for a gate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought United would have solved its problems once it came
to an agreement with its pilots, but I guess you can't anticipate
the weather,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service said Monday's storm dumped nearly 3
inches of rain on the Chicago area, knocking out power and airport
radar equipment. A backup radar system took over until repairs were
made.
</P>
<P>
   The storm made worse an already miserable summer for air travel
out of O'Hare, largely because of United Airlines' impasse on a new
contract with its pilots union. The airline has canceled more than
23,000 flights since April due to pilots who refused to work
overtime. United and the pilots agreed on a new contract last
month.

<HEADLINE> Freed Hostages Thank Libya for Help  </HEADLINE>
By SARAH EL DEEB
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) -- Four men held captive in the Philippines
for 140 days gathered at a historic fortress on the Mediterranean
to offer thanks to Libya for arranging their release, then finally
headed home to be reunited with family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   Libya reportedly paid the Abu Sayyaf rebels of the southern
Philippines $10 million in exchange for the freedom of the four men
and six other hostages released last month.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are now facing the sunrise after a long time of darkness,''
said Risto Vahanen, who spoke for the hostages freed Saturday
during the hourlong ceremony at the Red Palace, bordering Tripoli's
ancient walled quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Former captives German Marc Wallert, Frenchman Stephane Loisy
and Finn Seppo Franti attended, as did three senior officials from
Finland, France and Germany who also expressed their gratitude to
the Libyan government for its work to free the men.
</P>
<P>
   Some speakers wore dark glasses against the glare of the
Mediterranean sun, and their hair and clothes were stirred by sea
breezes during the outdoor gathering.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony appeared to bring the Libyans the results they
hoped for -- maximum publicity for their role in the hostage saga to
win international respectability for their country, long accused of
sponsoring terrorism and meddling in the affairs of other nations.
</P>
<P>
   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, who did not attend the ceremony,
said last week he hopes for improved relations with the United
States. His decision last year to surrender for a trial in the West
two Libyans accused in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 led to
the suspension of U.N. sanctions and better ties with Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In the most significant acknowledgment so far of Western
gratitude for Libya's efforts, German Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer flew to Tripoli Tuesday night to thank the government in
person.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reason of the visit is to say 'thank you' to all those who
worked very hard for the release and safe return of the hostages.
We are very thankful,'' he said on arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer met for about half an hour with Seif el Islam Gadhafi,
son of the Libyan leader and head of a nominally private
organization which led Libya's efforts to free the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Wallert, whose parents had been kidnapped as well but set free
before him, arrived in Germany late Tuesday aboard a German
military plane and bear-hugged his waiting mother and father.
</P>
<P>
   ''I suppose it's obvious to say that I am overjoyed,'' Marc
Wallert, who appeared in excellent spirits, said on the tarmac at
Hanover airport. ''I have never been so happy to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Finn hostages Vahanen and Franti arrived in Helsinki Tuesday to
a warm welcome from family and government officials. Vahanen kissed
the airport tarmac after he got off the plane from Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought that it would taste of aircraft fuel, but it tasted
of nothing,'' Vahanen joked.
</P>
<P>
   French hostage Loisy was embraced in turns by ecstatic family
members on arrival at Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Asked after the ceremony whether Libya's prestige had been
boosted by its role in freeing the hostages, Seif el-Islam Gadhafi,
the Libyan leader's son, said, ''Of course.''
</P>
<P>
   Libya denies paying ransom for the captives' freedom, saying it
only offered funding for development projects in the impoverished,
largely Muslim southern Philippines. Libya has longstanding ties
with Muslim rebels in the mostly Roman Catholic nation, has helped
build schools and mosques in the south and has been accused of
training rebels from the region's larger Muslim rebel group.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony came one day after Vahanen said the Abu Sayyaf
rebels raped some of the female captives. But speaking to reporters
in Tripoli on Tuesday, he denied he had spoken of rape and said
their mistreatment included inappropriate touching of the women.
</P>
<P>
   ''The questions were misleading and also what has been said has
been misunderstood,'' he said. ''We were humiliated and mistreated,
all of us, but we didn't report this before we were released
because we were afraid of being abused more or harassed.''
</P>
<P>
   The four Europeans freed Saturday were the last foreigners from
a group of 21 hostages taken hostage in April from a Malaysian
diving resort. The Abu Sayyaf rebels are still holding one Filipino
captured at the same time, two French television journalists and 12
Filipino Christian evangelists.
</P>
<P>
   A separate Abu Sayyaf faction is holding American Jeffrey
Schilling, a 24-year-old Muslim convert from Oakland, Calif., who
was abducted Aug. 28 after he voluntarily visited a rebel camp.
</P>
<P>
   Libyan negotiator Rajab Azzarouq has described Schilling as a
''willing hostage'' and Seif el Islam, the Libyan leader's son,
said Libya had no plans to negotiate his release.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there were signs the Philippines government may be
considering military action against the kidnappers. Marines and
four navy ships, including two landing craft, and armored personnel
carriers were on standby at a naval station in southern Zamboanga
city. A senior officer said the ships were going to Jolo island.

<HEADLINE> Storm Cat Colt Brings $6.8M  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- A yearling colt by Storm Cat was purchased
for $6.8 million on Tuesday during the Keeneland September Yearling
Sale.
</P>
<P>
   The amount was a record for Keeneland's September sale and the
highest price paid for a yearling in North America since Seattle
Dancer went for $13.1 million and Laa Etaab was purchased for $7
million in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   The chestnut colt was purchased by Irish bloodstock agent Demi
O'Byrne for the Coolmore Stud partnership of John Magnier and
Michael Tabor. O'Byrne outbid the Maktoum family, the ruling family
of Dubai, for the colt, which was consigned by Lane's End Farm as
agent.
</P>
<P>
   Storm Cat is considered one of the top sires in the thoroughbred
industry. The colt, who stands stud at Overbrook Farm near
Lexington, is a half-brother to Storm Song, a champion 2-year-old
filly and winner of the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew that (the colt) would make a good price,'' O'Byrne
said. ''Going in, we expected that he would be higher than the top
horse last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year's top seller during Keeneland's September sale was a
Kris S. colt that sold for $3.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wish the best of luck to Demi and the rest of the group,''
said John Ferguson, a bloodstock advisor to the Maktoum family.
''Obviously, we both had (the colt) rated very, very high. They
just had him rated one bid higher than we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Lane's End owner, William S. Farish, said he was shocked by the
colt's steep price.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm more than pleased,'' he said. ''It was a fantastic sale.
He's one of the best we've ever raised and obviously we're thrilled
with the price.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Sheikh Hamdan al Maktoum's Shadwell Estate
Company bid $4.4 million to purchase a dark bay filly by Storm Cat,
out of the French-bred East of the Moon. The price tag set a world
record for a yearling filly.
</P>
<P>
   Keeneland sold 225 yearlings Tuesday for a total of $94,590,000.
The average for the session was $420,400 and the median was
$180,000. A year ago, Keeneland sold 254 yearlings for $69,727,000,
with an average of $274,516 and a median of $147,500.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's top seller during Keeneland's September sale was a
Kris S. colt that sold for $3.9 million.

<HEADLINE> Nader Mocked by Fellow Guest, Leno  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT LINDLAW
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- In his late-night talk show debut, Green
Party candidate Ralph Nader used a rubber chicken to protest his
exclusion from presidential debates, then ended up debating a
fellow guest.
</P>
<P>
   Nader pulled the chicken from behind a couch on ''The Tonight
Show with Jay Leno'' to make his point that Republican George W.
Bush and Democrat Al Gore are ducking debates with him.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only explanation I can give you as to why Bush and Gore
are afraid to have me debate,'' he said, clutching the chicken
around the neck.
</P>
<P>
   The gag drew tepid laughter.
</P>
<P>
   ''This comedy is not easy, is it Ralph?'' Leno said.
</P>
<P>
   Other jokes that are Nader favorites on the campaign trail drew
similar responses.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bush is really a corporation running for president, disguised
as a person,'' Nader said, to scattered laughs.
</P>
<P>
   The Hollywood audience seemed baffled when he told Leno what he
does for fun: ''strawberries.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's vitamin C,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   When Leno pressed him, he allowed that he likes to ''go to a
ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   But lines reminding the crowd of his longtime role as an
outsider and watchdog drew hearty applause.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unlike Bush or Gore, I am not for sale,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nader's chicken stunt backfired when fellow guest, comedian D.L.
Hughley, began cracking jokes at Nader's expense.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was actually thinking about a two-piece and a biscuit,'' he
said, looking at the limp chicken.
</P>
<P>
   When Nader said he would continue to fly coach class, Hughley
said he wasn't keen on the president sitting next to him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hey, hand me the peanuts, prez,'' Hughley mockingly asked.
''That's scary.''
</P>
<P>
   When Nader told Hughley 10,500 people had attended his rally in
Portland, Ore., recently, Hughley fired back: ''In Portland,
Oregon, they don't have nothing else to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience roared, and Nader laughed too.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Leno was out of the picture; Nader had turned to face
Hughley.
</P>
<P>
   ''What are you going say when we do the same thing in Boston,
Minneapolis, Seattle?''
</P>
<P>
   ''I am ignorant of politics. I know that I respect you a great
deal. Firestone should be scared to death of you right now,''
Hughley said, referring to the company's defective tires.
</P>
<P>
   But then Leno called Nader ''a little staid, a little dull,'' as
he introduced Nader's campaign commercial, which is a send-up of a
MasterCard ad.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by Leno whether he would vote for Gore or Bush if forced
to make a choice, Nader said: ''I would invoke the cruel and
unusual punishment provision of the U.S. Constitution and punt!''

<HEADLINE> Heavy Rain Lashes Japan, Kills 7  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT STODDARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Rescue workers paddled rowboats past inundated
buses and homes Tuesday in central Japan to pick up residents
stranded by floods and mudslides that killed seven people and
forced the nation's biggest carmaker to stop production.
</P>
<P>
   Rainfall totaling 23 inches was recorded over the past 24-hour
period, the local observatory said. The record rainfall was
expected to surpass 32 inches in some areas, the Meteorological
Agency said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the dead, 41 people were injured and two were
missing in the floods set off by the torrential rains, the national
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in the industrial city of Nagoya told more than
360,000 people to evacuate their homes. Mitsuhiro Niimura, another
Nagoya official, said Wednesday morning that 5,545 people stayed
overnight at schools and other public facilities, with food either
airlifted in by military helicopters or shipped by boats.
</P>
<P>
   Among the seven dead were a 53-year-old firefighter, who fell
into a flooded roadside ditch, and a 49-year-old man buried by
mudslides, Horiguchi said.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota Motor Corp. stopped production nationwide because of the
downpour. Toyota and many of its parts makers are located in
Nagoya, about 170 miles west of Tokyo, so work stoppages there
affect operations in other areas.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi Motors Corp. also stopped production at its two
factories in Nagoya, company spokesman Isao Sakaibara said.
</P>
<P>
   Torrential rains also cut power to bullet trains, forcing about
50,000 passengers to sleep overnight at railway stations or in
stalled trains. Services resumed in the afternoon after a record
interruption of more than 18 hours.
</P>
<P>
   About 11,000 homes were out of electricity on Okinawa and other
small islands Wednesday morning because of power-supply trouble
caused by the typhoon, the national broadcaster NHK said.
</P>
<P>
   More violent weather was on the way, with typhoon Saomai heading
toward Kyushu, Japan's southernmost main island.
</P>
<P>
   Packing winds up to 89 mph, Saomai was 99 miles northwest of
Naha, the capital of Japan's southernmost prefecture of Okinawa,
late Tuesday. Okinawa is about 1,000 miles southwest of Tokyo.

<HEADLINE> Mets 10, Brewers 2  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Benny Agbayani homered and drove in three runs
as the New York Mets' bats awoke from their silent September to
beat the Milwaukee Brewers 10-2 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, who had scored only 30 runs in losing eight of 10 this
month, moved within two games of first-place Atlanta in the NL East
and were 4&AMP;frac12; ahead of Arizona, who played later Tuesday, in the wild
card race. The Braves lost 5-4 to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets scored four runs in the second -- more than they had in
12 of the past 15 games -- aided by catcher Tyler Houston's two
throwing errors and a two-run single by Agbayani.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby J. Jones (9-5) made that hold up, allowing two runs and
seven hits in eight efficient innings. Jones struck out five and
walked two, improving to 5-0 in his last nine starts.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Pratt, subbing for the struggling Mike Piazza, walked twice
and had an RBI single. Edgardo Alfonzo added a solo homer in the
eighth. New York's 10 runs and 13 hits were its since getting 16
hits in a 13-3 win over Randy Johnson and Arizona on Aug. 25.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a pair of errors that helped the Mets break through
in the second inning against John Snyder (3-9),
</P>
<P>
   With runners on first and second and one out, Jones bunted in
front of the plate. Houston picked the ball up, looked toward
second before throwing wildly to first for an error, scoring Pratt.
</P>
<P>
   Agbayani followed with a two-run single to center and came
around to score after a wild sequence of Milwaukee throws.
</P>
<P>
   Houston fielded Lou Collier's wide throw home from center and
tried to nab Agbayani at second. The low throw hit shortstop Mark
Loretta's glove and bounded into shallow left-center. Agbayani
raced home beating the relay to Snyder, who was covering the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Abbott added an RBI single in the third. The Mets scored
two more in the fifth, with their first three-hit frame since the
third inning on Sept. 1 at St. Louis -- a span of 93 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo led off with a walk and then with one out, Todd Zeile,
Jay Payton and Pratt hit consecutive singles, scoring two runs and
knocking out Snyder. Agbayani added a solo homer, his 15th, in the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers, who along with the Houston Astros were eliminated
from postseason contention, scored in the first on a two-out RBI
single by Jeromy Burnitz, and an RBI double by Geoff Jenkins in the
third.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder allowed seven runs -- five earned -- and nine hits in 4 1-3
innings to lose his seventh straight decision.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Abbott had been 3-for-32 with runners in scoring position
before driving in Zeile with a single in the third inning. ... New
York also played well in the field. Payton made a nice running grab
in right-center to rob Ron Belliard of a hit in the second inning
and Zeile made a diving stop on Mark Loretta's grounder down the
first-base line in the third. ... Mets 3B Robin Ventura returned to
the lineup after two days off and singled in his first at-bat,
snapping an 0-for-23 stretch. ... Snyder is 0-7 with a 6.13 ERA in
14 starts since June 22. ... Milwaukee's Richie Sexson went 0-for-3
to snap his 12-game hitting streak. ... Mets GM Steve Phillips
missed the game to be with his wife, Marni, who gave birth to the
couple's third child in the afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Bush Dismisses 'Rat' Allegation  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A GOP commercial that subtly flashes the word
''RATS'' across the screen is coming off the air amid allegations
the Republicans were trying to send a subliminal message about Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush called the notion ''bizarre and weird,'' and his
campaign made light of it all. The GOP admaker said he was just
trying to make the spot visually interesting.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's campaign and experts in political advertising said
the word choice -- as an announcer was denouncing Gore's Medicare
plan -- could hardly have been an accident.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never seen anything like it,'' the vice president said
Tuesday in Middletown, Ohio. Running mate Joseph Lieberman called
the ad ''very disappointing and strange.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure the public will be puzzled by it as we are and want
an explanation,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush noted that the word appears only fleetingly -- for a tiny
fraction of a second. Played at full speed, it's barely noticeable,
particularly if the viewer isn't looking for the word.
</P>
<P>
   ''One frame out of 900 hardly in my judgment makes a
conspiracy,'' Bush said Tuesday in Orlando, Fla. ''I am convinced
this is not intentional. You don't need to play, you know, cute
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides reveled in the story, which they leaked to the press
after being alerted by a careful viewer in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ad graphics don't pop up out of thin air. Someone sits down at
a computer and creates them,'' said Gore spokesman Doug Hattaway.
</P>
<P>
   The ad, which has been running in several states for more than
two weeks, touts Bush's plan for adding prescription drugs to
Medicare, arguing that senior citizens will have more control over
their health care under Bush's proposal. Gore's plan, the ad says,
will be run by bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   Words flash on the screen to echo the announcer's message: ''The
Gore prescription plan: Bureaucrats decide.''
</P>
<P>
   But just as the announcer says ''bureaucrats decide,'' the word
''RATS,'' in large, white capital letters, fills the black screen.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Castellanos, who made the ad for the Republican National
Committee, said he flashed the letters -- the tail end of
''bureaucrats'' -- so the ad would look more visually interesting
and it was just a coincidence it came out ''rats.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a visual drumbeat,'' he said. ''People get bored watching
TV. You're trying to get them interested and involved.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Jake Siewert said President Clinton had
not seen the ad but was looking forward to it. ''I'll leave it to
you to judge whether that is an accident or a dirty trick,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside analysts said it they found it hard to believe the word
was not deliberately placed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The word 'rats' is so carefully superimposed. It's not like it
just randomly appears on the screen,'' said Darrell West, an expert
on political advertising at Brown University.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's cheap and manipulative. It certainly takes the level of
political discourse down several notches,'' said Loyal Rue, who
studies political deception at Luther College in Decorah, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Bush made it clear he does not endorse subliminal messages. The
term itself gave him trouble all day, repeatedly coming out as
''subliminable.''
</P>
<P>
   ''To put people's minds at ease I will say loud and clear: This
kind of practice is not acceptable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the RNC argued that the story is old. Two weeks
ago, Fox News Channel noted that the word ''rats'' flashed on
screen -- a report that evidentally did not prompt the RNC to change
the ad. ''This is not a new story,'' RNC Chairman Jim Nicholson
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The ad has run for more than two weeks, and Bush's
communications director, Karen Hughes, said it was being replaced
Tuesday as scheduled. The RNC already has spent some $2.5 million
to air it in 33 markets. One Democratic official said the Gore
campaign, unimpressed with the ad's effectiveness, waited to leak
the story until the ad was about to come off the air.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes made light of the question of a subliminal message,
saying the Bush campaign ''was not trying to get the rat vote.''
She greeted reporters on the plane in Orlando with a platter of
cheese and snacks.
</P>
<P>
   She also pointed out a second word that flashes by in big
letters -- ''wit,'' she said, while the regular message says
''Interferes with doctors.'' ''I can assure you that we are not
spending Republican ad money to call Al Gore a wit,'' she said. The
letters actually continue, spelling out the full word ''with.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, the Federal Communications Commission adopted a policy
saying that subliminal advertising was contrary to the public
interest. If the FCC received a complaint, it would investigate
broadcasters who aired the ad, but no complaints have been received
about this ad, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if it was intentional, subliminal messages aren't
necessarily effective, said Bill Benoit, who studies political
advertising at the University of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no conclusive evidence that it works,'' he said. ''Of
course, that doesn't stop advertisers.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Rick Helling pitched three-hit ball for
eight innings Tuesday, leading the Texas Rangers over the Baltimore
Orioles 9-1 in a doubleheader opener.
</P>
<P>
   Helling (15-11) gave up Brady Anderson's homer leading off the
game and just two singles after that, winning for the first time in
six starts since beating Boston Aug. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Helling struck out five and walked none. In his previous two
starts, he failed to last past the fourth inning, and in his
previous five, he had a 9.12 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Scarborough Green had the first three-hit game of his career,
and Bill Haselman went 3-for-4 with a homer and two doubles.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Sierra called up from Triple-A Oklahoma on Sept. 5, went
0-for-5 in his first home start for the Rangers since Aug. 29,
1992.
</P>
<P>
   John Parrish (2-4) was tagged for five runs and six hits in 1
2-3 innings. He has a 22.22 ERA in his last three starts.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson hit Helling's second pitch into the right-field seats
for his 17th homer. Helling didn't give up another hit until Greg
Myers led off the seventh with a single. Anderson added a two-out
single in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Texas tied it in the first on Gabe Kapler's sacrifice fly, then
took a 5-1 lead in the second on Royce Clayton's RBI single, Luis
Alicea's sacrifice fly and Rafael Palmeiro's two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   Run-scoring singles by Kapler in the fourth and Clayton in the
fifth made it 7-1, and Haselman homered leading off the seventh and
added an RBI double in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Anderson has led off games with home runs 42 times. ...
Parrish was making his first start since being recalled from
Triple-A Rochester on Sept. 5. He had the shortest outing of his
eight big league starts. ... The Rangers have won six of their last
nine. ... Orioles DH Jeff Conine left in the fourth after mildly
spraining his left ankle while running out a popup in the first.

<HEADLINE> Mudslinging Charges Leveled in Fla.  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE SCHNEIDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   COCOA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Republican Rep. Bill McCollum demanded
Tuesday that supporters of his Democratic opponent for U.S. Senate
pull television ads he says distort his record on gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're slinging mud right off the bat which I find appalling.
I think you should be ashamed of those ads,'' McCollum told Bill
Nelson at a debate. ''They're wrong, they're misleading and they're
lowering the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The gun-control ad, which is running in Tampa and West Palm
Beach television markets, accuses McCollum of not supporting a
waiting period to do background checks for gun purchases. McCollum,
after the debate, said he has supported a 72-hour waiting period.
</P>
<P>
   The ads were paid for by Handgun Control Inc. and the Florida
Democratic Party, not Nelson's campaign. Nelson said he didn't have
anything to do with the ads but said he believed they were
accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't run and hide from the truth,'' Nelson told McCollum.
</P>
<P>
   GOP officials view the race for the U.S. Senate seat being
vacated by retiring Republican Connie Mack as crucial to
maintaining their Senate majority. Democrats see it as an
opportunity to gain a Senate seat and bolster their party's
prospects in a state that has grown increasingly Republican.
</P>
<P>
   It was the sixth public encounter between Nelson, Florida's
insurance commissioner, and McCollum, a U.S. House member.

William A. Nierenberg:
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- William A. Nierenberg, who worked on the
Manhattan Project that helped produce the atomic bomb and later
directed of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, died Sunday of
cancer. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   Nierenberg was best known for his work in magnetic resonance and
low-energy nuclear physics, which included work on the Manhattan
Project during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   From 1960 to 1962, he served as assistant secretary general of

deep-sea hot springs and warned of the growing dangers of carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere
Stanley Turrentine:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stanley Turrentine, a jazz saxophonist whose hit
''Sugar'' established him in the popular mainstream and influenced
musicians in many other genres, died Tuesday after suffering a
stroke. He was 66.
</P>
<P>
   Turrentine played tenor saxophone, and mixed jazz with blues,
rock, pop and rhythm and blues. He lived in Fort Washington, Md.,
outside Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ''His impact on jazz was just astonishing,'' said his agent,
Robin Burgess. ''He had a large impact on fusion, electric jazz and
organ trio music.''
</P>
<P>
   Turrentine grew up in Pittsburgh, surrounded by music. His
brother Tommy played trumpet, and the two played together in
Pittsburgh while they were still in high school.
</P>
<P>
   Turrentine started his professional career playing with Ray
Charles and Max Roach. He went solo in the 1960s and scored his
biggest hit in 1970 with ''Sugar,'' which became something of a
jazz standard.
</P>
<P>
   His blues-influenced riffs brought him commercial success with
albums including ''Stan 'The Man' Turrentine,'' ''Up at Minton's,''
and ''Never Let Me Go.''

<HEADLINE> Marlins 5, Braves 4  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE HENRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Braves' NL East lead is dwindling
again.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Millwood was chased in the seventh inning and the Florida
Marlins survived a rough ninth to beat the Braves 5-4 Tuesday
night, cutting Atlanta's NL East lead to two games over
second-place New York.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, which has lost three straight, trailed 5-2 before
Reggie Sanders' RBI single in the eighth chased Jesus Sanchez
(9-10), who improved to 4-1 against the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Alfonseca walked pinch-hitter Bobby Bonilla leading off
the ninth, then gave up consecutive singles to Rafael Furcal and
Andruw Jones as Atlanta closed within a run.
</P>
<P>
   With runners at first and third and no outs, Chipper Jones
grounded to shortstop Alex Gonzalez, who threw out Furcal at the
plate. Brian Jordan then reached on a infield single, a slow roller
to third, loading the bases for Andres Galarraga.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonseca got Galarraga to ground into a 6-4-3 double play for
his major league-leading 40th save in 44 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood (9-11) allowed all five runs and 10 hits in 6 1-3
innings and hasn't won consecutive starts since beating the Marlins
on July 26 and Arizona on Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez gave up three runs -- one earned -- and nine hits in 7 2-3
innings, winning for the first time in five starts since beating
Los Angeles on Aug. 14. He had a 12.89 ERA and 0-2 record in his
previous four starts.
</P>
<P>
   Florida took a 2-0 lead in the second on Preston Wilson's 26th
homer and Sanchez's RBI single, then added a run in the fifth on
Cliff Floyd's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta took advantage of three errors, by third baseman Mike
Lowell, catcher Ramon Castro and right fielder Mark Kotsay, to
close to 3-2 in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell misplayed a grounder, putting runners on first and third,
and Castro threw Millwood's sacrifice into right field, where
Kotsay picked up the ball and threw it wildly toward the Marlins'
dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Florida took a 5-2 lead in the sixth on Floyd's run-scoring
double, which chased Millwood, and Wilson's RBI single off Kerry
Ligtenberg.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Atlanta LF B.J. Surhoff, out since Thursday with a pulled
right quadriceps, took light batting practice but is unlikely to
return in this series. ... Henry Rodriguez, who flied out as a
pinch hitter in the eighth, has gone 17 games without an RBI.

<HEADLINE> Abortion Web Site Verdict Appealed  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM McCALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- A federal appeals court on Tuesday
suggested mediation to settle a $109 million verdict that declared
a Web site and posters listing the names of abortion doctors and
clinics were threats that went beyond free speech.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys made their arguments Tuesday before a panel of the 9th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   The case is widely seen as a test of a Supreme Court ruling that
defined a threat as explicit language likely to cause ''imminent
lawless action'' -- and a measure of how far anti-abortion activists
can go in harrying doctors and clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Ferrara, the lawyer representing the activists,
declined comment after Judge Alex Kozinski offered both sides two
days to consider a settlement. He and the other judges repeatedly
offered hypothetical situations in an effort to determine whether
jurors were correct in deciding an implied threat could be an
explicit threat.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Vullo, the lawyer for the doctors and Planned Parenthood,
said mediation would only settle the dispute between the individual
clients, not the law underlying the case. She felt confident the
verdict would be upheld.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a Web site called ''The Nuremberg Files'' that
listed hundreds of abortion doctors accused of committing ''crimes
against humanity.'' It invited readers to send in doctors'
addresses, license plate numbers and even the names of their
children.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, anti-abortion activists argued that the posters and
Web site were free speech protected under the First Amendment.
Critics called it a hit list.
</P>
<P>
   A number of legal experts have criticized the February 1999 jury
verdict and the instructions jurors received. Others consider the
decision sound, citing years of arson, shootings and death threats
against doctors and clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrara argued that any threat must be direct and explicit, as
the Supreme Court has ruled, repeatedly calling the case
unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's intimidation by means of an unintended threat,'' he told
the judges. ''We've departed from all jurisprudence.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury was told by U.S. District Judge Robert Jones to
consider the history of violence in the anti-abortion movement,
including three doctors killed after their names appeared on the
lists.
</P>
<P>
   One was Dr. Barnett Slepian, who was slain by a sniper in
October 1998 at his home near Buffalo, N.Y. Slepian's name was
crossed out on ''The Nuremberg Files'' Web site later that day. The
site has since been removed from the Web.

Clinton Wins N.Y. Senate Primary
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton breezed past a little-known
challenger to win New York's Democratic Senate primary today. With 16 percent of
precincts reporting, Clinton had 71,714 votes or 78 percent and orthopedic
surgeon Mark McMahon had 20,481 votes or 22 percent. As nine states and the
District of Columbia held contests on the last big primary day of 2000, the
first lady built a wide lead over McMahon en route to her contest against
unopposed Republican Rep. Rick Lazio in November. With 16 percent of precincts
reporting, Clinton had 71,714 votes or 78 percent and McMahon had 20,481 votes

non-partisan runoff. It was Perkins' third attempt to knock Smitherman out of
office. Perkins received 6,326 votes, or about 57 percent. Smitherman had 4,854

admaker said he was just trying to make the spot visually interesting. ''I've
never seen anything like it,'' said Gore. His running mate, Joseph Lieberman,

Traffic Safety Administration had issued a warning after the company refused to
expand a recall of 6.5 million tires.

Disparities in Death Penalty System Found
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Justice Department study found wide racial and
geographic disparities in the federal death penalty system, but Attorney General
Janet Reno blamed them on injustice in society rather than bias in her
department. Releasing the study today, Reno called for additional studies and
legislation but rejected renewed calls for a moratorium on federal executions
that poured in from Congress and civil rights advocates in response to the
figures. President Clinton said the data raised questions ''since we're supposed
to have a uniform law of the land.'' But he noted there had been ''no
suggestion, as far as I know, that any of the cases where the convictions
occurred were wrongly decided'' and said he would consult Reno before deciding
what to do.

Remains May Be Of Female Gladiator

   LONDON (AP)-- No one knows her name, or how she died, but archaeologists
think she was a gladiator in Roman London, and, from the evidence, a very
popular one. The existence of female gladiators in Roman times has long been
known to historians, but now what are believed to be the first remains of one --
a young woman in her 20s, buried with high honors -- have been unearthed at a
Roman cemetery in London. The Museum of London displayed the evidence for the
first time Tuesday.

   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Chinese Olympic officials, after acknowledging that
nearly all of the 27 athletes bounced from their team had failed drug tests,
charged that the problem was not limited to China. ''Many countries know that
they have athletes using (performance-enhancing drug) EPO, including America,
Australia, Germany, England, France -- they all know,'' said Chinese Olympic
Committee spokeswoman He Huixian.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Helps Allies Raise Funds  </HEADLINE>
By BART JANSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Citing long-time political ties, President
Clinton raised $500,000 Tuesday at two fund-raisers for Democratic
congressional candidates from Arkansas and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas state Sen. Mike Ross described campaigning in 1981 to
return Clinton to the governor's mansion when his motorcade was
humbler -- one aging compact.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton repaid the favor by helping raise about $300,000 for
Ross' campaign to knock off GOP Rep. Jay Dickey, who represents the
president's birthplace and childhood home. The race is one of
relatively few competitive House contests nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a special evening for me at the end of a special
day,'' he said, after voting for his wife in the New York Senate
race.
</P>
<P>
   About 300 people attended the event at the home of Mack McLarty,
Clinton's first chief of staff. U.S. Sen. Blanche Lincoln was among
the ''Arkansans Supporting an Arkansan.''
</P>
<P>
   An elderly man, whom White House aides didn't identify, fainted
in the heat as Clinton began to speak, but medics revived him and
he was standing by the end of the speech.
</P>
<P>
   At an earlier dinner of crab cakes and beef tenderloin for Texas
Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, Clinton recalled working with her in
1972 for presidential candidate George McGovern. Clinton joked that
nobody thought he'd become president at the time, but that his
mother simply hoped he would cut his hair.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Johnson would continue fighting for equal rights
and affordable health care.
</P>
<P>
   ''The best is still out there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 people attended the event that raised $200,000 for The
Future Fund, which Johnson created to benefit Democratic
congressional candidates. Johnson faces no Republican opponent in
the general election.
</P>
<P>
   The event was held at the home of Robert Johnson, the founder of
Black Entertainment Television who proposes to create the airline
DC Air as a spinoff from the merger of USAirways and United
Airlines. Johnson joked that he expected no favors from hosting
Clinton and Johnson, who serves on the House Transportation
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will all be on the merits,'' Johnson said.

<HEADLINE> Vineland vets' home gets $10,000 -- from a casino, through Miss America </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - A group of veterans that has been
adopted by Showboat Casino-Hotel finally hit the jackpot there
Tuesday. But it wasn't the usual kind.
</P>
<P>
   The veterans, who live at the New Jersey Memorial Home for
Veterans in Vineland, got a $10,000 donation from the casino. Miss
America 2000 Heather French presented a check to the home's chief
executive officer in a ceremony at the casino.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can assure you, the check will be used to improve the
quality of life of our residents,'' veterans home CEO Joseph Romano
told her.
</P>
<P>
   Twice a year for 10 years, a group of 20 people from the home
have made the trip here from Vineland to gamble and be treated to
dinner by the casino, according to Mary Ann Cassidy, director of
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   She said the casino was happy to donate the money in the name of
French, who chose to promote the cause of homeless veterans during
her reign as Miss America.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're the reason this country is the greatest country in the
world,'' French told the veterans.

<HEADLINE> Minn. Store Heir Wins Senate Nod  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Department store heir Mark Dayton won the
Democratic nomination for Senate on Tuesday after pouring $5
million of his fortune into the race.
</P>
<P>
   With 47 percent of precincts reporting, Dayton had 108,793
votes, or 41 percent. His closest challenger among his three main
rivals, trial attorney Mike Ciresi, had 24 percent, or 63,888
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton, the great-grandson of the man who founded what is now
Target Corp., will face Republican Sen. Rod Grams in November.
Grams easily won the GOP nomination, trouncing an opponent who ran
no active campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The race for the right to challenge Grams was the most expensive
primary race in Minnesota history, with Ciresi matching Dayton's
spending.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton saturated the airwaves starting in early summer, far
ahead of his opponents, with ads attacking the high price of
prescription drugs and proclaiming his support for universal health
care.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Found Near Politician's Home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- A pipe bomb was found Tuesday
night outside the Belfast home of a politician linked to one of the
sides in a violent Protestant paramilitary feud, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The device was discovered outside the house of Billy Hutchinson,
a Progressive Unionist Party member of the Northern Ireland
assembly. The bomb did not go off, but several people were
evacuated as bomb-disposal experts were called in.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson's party is linked to the Ulster Volunteer Force, an
armed pro-British group whose feud with the rival Ulster Defense
Association is blamed for three deaths and the shooting of an
11-year-old girl in the past month.
</P>
<P>
   A pub on Belfast's staunchly Protestant Shankill Road, near
Hutchinson's house, was also hit Tuesday by a device which exploded
after bouncing off a security gate. Nobody was hurt.

<HEADLINE> 71-year-old librarian in dead heat with Michael Forbes  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A 71-year-old former librarian who raised just
$40,000 for her campaign held a slim lead Tuesday night over Rep.
Michael Forbes, the three-term Long Island incumbent who switched
parties to become a Democrat 14 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   With 100 percent of the vote counted in unofficial returns,
Regina Seltzer was ahead 5,825 to 5,786 over Forbes, who raised
$1.4 million in an effort to beat back his opponent in the eastern
Long Island district.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point I'm declaring victory,'' an exuberant Seltzer
said in a telephone interview 90 minutes after the polls closed.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said voting machines had been impounded for a recount
that would take several days. But in a phone interview from
Washington, D.C., he added: ''If my opponent is truly several dozen
votes ahead, we're going to support her and live by the will of the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes switched parties last year after being wooed by Democrats
trying to reclaim the House majority. He was personally welcomed
into the Democratic Party by President Clinton, but he voted for
impeachment and opposes abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Mailings from the Republican Party to registered Democrats in
his district gleefully touted his 100 percent rating from the
Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mike Forbes is a goner,'' Jim Wilkinson, spokesman for the
National Republican Congressional Committee, said Tuesday night as
Seltzer's strong challenge became apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Seltzer entered the race after other local Democrats backed out
under pressure from party leaders in Washington. Seltzer said her
showing proved that local Democrats were not happy about having a
one-time Republican foisted on them.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can only conclude one thing: The people of Long Island, of
the first Congressional District, don't want to be told by
Washington, D.C., who is going to represent them,'' said Seltzer.
''They want a Democrat who represents them to be really and truly a
Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   Seltzer, a former school librarian, served on the Brookhaven
Town Council two decades ago and went to law school at age 50.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I don't think this is about me,'' she said. ''This is
about the people of this community who have said in no uncertain
terms to Mr. Forbes, 'You're fired.' It's a really, really amazing
thing. I am so proud of the people of this community for having the
courage to get up there and to buck the Washington bureaucrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Seltzer also got a boost when Newsday endorsed her two weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   As an attorney, she now mostly works free of charge for groups
like the Long Island Pine Barrens Society. And she put her law
degree to good use recently, suing the state Democratic Party to
stop them from running ads on Forbes' behalf before the primary had
been held determining who the party's candidate is. She won.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of Tuesday's Democratic primary will face Republican
Felix Grucci in the November general election. Grucci won an
Independence Party primary Tuesday night over Jack Fisher.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Witness Faces Criminal Charges  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A Florida taxi driver who refused to answer
questions before a grand jury investigating global terrorism has
been indicted on perjury and contempt charges, according to court
papers released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ihab Mohamed Ali, 38, of Orlando has refused to testify despite
spending 16 months in prison for civil contempt and a judge who
encouraged him to testify by reading from the Koran: ''Hide not
testimony. He who hideth it verily his heart is sinful. Allah is
aware of what ye do.''
</P>
<P>
   His testimony was sought in the investigation into terrorism
allegedly controlled by Osama bin Laden, a Saudi millionaire blamed
for the bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury already has returned indictments against bin
Laden and 16 others in the bombings that killed 224 people,
including 12 Americans. It has tried to learn how much support bin
Laden has in the United States for his alleged terrorism
organization, al Qaeda.
</P>
<P>
   Ali is accused of violating an immunity order to testify before
the grand jury and of lying when he said he had never communicated
with bin Laden. Prosecutors say Ali's name and code names appear on
documents recovered in searches in Nairobi, Kenya, after the
embassy bombings.
</P>
<P>
   They say they want to know Ali's relationship with al Qaeda,
with bin Laden and with the organization's military commanders.
They also want to know about pilot training Ali received in
Oklahoma in 1994 and trips he took abroad that may have been linked
with al Qaeda's activities.
</P>
<P>
   Louis M. Freeman, Ali's lawyer, said only that his client was
''happy to see'' that the pretrial services department had
recommended that he be released on bail.

<HEADLINE> Tigers 10, White Sox 3  </HEADLINE>
By RICK GANO
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Bobby Higginson homered to cap a six-run third
inning as the Detroit Tigers ended a six-game losing streak Tuesday
night, beating the Chicago White Sox 10-3.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the loss, Chicago's magic number for clinching the AL
Central was reduced to 13 when the Boston Red Sox beat second-place
Cleveland 8-6 at Jacobs Field.
</P>
<P>
   Magglio Ordonez homered twice for the White Sox and drove in
three runs, giving him career highs with 31 homers and 118 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Mlicki (5-11) gave up three runs and three hits in five
innings, including Ordonez's two-run shot in the first and solo
blast in the fifth. The White Sox managed just four hits as Willie
Blair pitched three innings of one-hit ball and Todd Jones
finished.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit jumped on rookie Kip Wells (5-8) for seven hits and six
runs in just two-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   Deivi Cruz had an RBI double, Juan Encarnacion a run-scoring
single and Billy McMillon an RBI single in a three-run second off
Wells, making his second start since returning from the minors.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Palmer, Tony Clark and Cruz singled to finish Wells in the
third. Brad Ausmus had an RBI single off reliever Sean Lowe, who
hit Damion Easley to load the bases and gave up a sacrifice fly to
McMillon before Higginson drove a three-run shot to right, his 26th
homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Morris hit his first homer for Detroit in the ninth off Matt
Ginter.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Ordonez has six career multihomer games, including four
this season. His two homers allowed the White Sox to tie the club
record of 198 set in 1998 .... The victory was just the second for
Detroit in eight games against the White Sox this season and first
in five games at Comiskey Park, where the teams got into an ugly
brawl in April. ... Another small crowd for a first-place team,
just 15,296. ... Juan Gonzalez was 0-for-5 with three strikeouts
and is 1-for-17 in his last four games. ... Wells entered the game
2-0 with a 1.54 ERA against the Tigers in 11 2-3 innings.

<HEADLINE> Giants 9, Astros 5  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Marvin Benard, Barry Bonds and Bill Mueller all
homered as the San Francisco Giants rallied past Houston for the
second straight night, beating the Astros 9-5 for their 12th win in
14 games.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Estes (15-4) recovered from a shaky start to win for the
10th time in 11 decisions. Estes, who has won three straight
starts, allowed four first-inning runs, then gave up only one run
in the next six innings.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco began the night with an 8&AMP;frac12;-game lead over
second-place Arizona in the NL West.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, which had won three straight NL Central titles, was
eliminated from postseason contention earlier in the night when the
New York Mets beat Milwaukee. The Astros (63-82) are assured of
their first losing season since going 65-97 in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bagwell hit his 43rd homer, tying the Astros team record he
set in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Estes struck out eight in seven innings, allowing five runs and
nine hits.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Elarton (16-6) allowed six runs and seven hits in six
innings. Coming in, according to research by the Elias Sports
Bureau, his .762 winning percentage was the third-highest for a
pitcher on a team with a losing record, trailing only Sandy Koufax
(19-5, .792 for Los Angeles in 1964) and Bib Gibson (23-7, .767 for
St. Louis in 1970).
</P>
<P>
   Benard hit his 12th homer of the year on the third pitch of the
game, but Houston took a 4-1 lead in the bottom half on Richard
Hidalgo's two-run double and Moises Alou's two-run triple. Hidalgo
has nine RBIs in his last four games.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco came back in the third on Felipe Crespo's two-run
single and Rich Aurilia's two-run double, but Bagwell's homer made
it 5-all in the bottom half.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds put the Giants ahead to stay in the fifth with his 46th
homer, matching his career high, set in 1993. Mueller hit a two-run
homer in the seventh and Rich Aurilia added an RBI grounder in the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Benard has eight homers leading off games, including two
this year (also Aug. 15 at Montreal). ... Hidalgo is hitting .375
(9-for-24) with the bases loaded this season with four doubles, a
home run and 23 RBI this season.

<HEADLINE> Fox To Ensure Better Oil Prices  </HEADLINE>
By MARIANELA JIMENEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) -- Mexican President-elect Vicente Fox
promised Tuesday to work with Central American nations to ensure
they receive fair prices for oil.
</P>
<P>
   All five Central American countries want some price relief, and
many view Mexico, Venezuela and Ecuador as potential saviors.
</P>
<P>
   Oil futures surged to a new 10-year high Monday amid widespread
skepticism about OPEC's plan to reduce prices by pumping an
additional 800,000 barrels of crude daily. However, prices dipped
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Fox promised to look for ways to reduce oil costs during a visit
to the Costa Rican capital on the third-day of his five-nation tour
of Central America. The Dominican Republic's president, Hipolito
Mejia, also flew to Costa Rica to add to the calls for cheaper oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Several Central American presidents are pushing for improvements
to the San Jose pact, an agreement under which Venezuela and Mexico
have supplied Central America with oil at preferential prices and
financing terms since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want fair prices (for oil), and in the case of Central
America, we want to see how we can extend the San Jose pact,'' Fox
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He added, however that ''prices should not hold back growth,
because if this happens, the first to be affected would be
Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who will be sworn in as Mexico's president Dec. 1, met with
Costa Rican President Miguel Angel Rodriguez, as well as Mejia on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Fox will wrap up his Central American trip on Thursday with
meetings in El Salvador and Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   On July 2, he became the first opposition candidate to be
popularly elected to Mexico's presidency. Fox defeated a candidate
for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, which had held
the presidency since its creation in 1929.

<HEADLINE> Graham wins Independence Party primary; ''Grandpa Munster'' back in the political fray </HEADLINE>
With BC-NY--New York Primary
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Former Watertown Mayor Jeff Graham beat Jeff
Beller, an Albany area advocate for renewable energy, in an
Independence Party U.S. Senate primary on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The party is the New York arm of the national Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Al Lewis, who came to fame as ''Grandpa'' in ''The
Munsters'' television series, was back in the political hunt as
part of a three-way primary for the Green Party's Senate
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Actor-comedian-political activist Lewis ran unsuccessfully for
governor in 1998 on the Green Party line.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's primary voting, Lewis competed against Ronnie
Dugger, the founding editor of the Texas Observer who has written
biographies of both Lyndon Johnson and Ronald Reagan, and Mark
Dunau, an organic farmer, for the Green Party nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Results of the Green Party primary weren't expected to be known
for several days after the vote because paper ballots were being
used in New York City for that race.
</P>
<P>
   In another third party U.S. Senate primary, Republican Louis
Wein, who ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1990 on the Right to
Life Party's line, faced John Adefope, a telephone company
engineer, for the anti-abortion party's nomination. With almost all
the votes in, the race was too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   The winners will face Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton and
Republican Rick Lazio.

<HEADLINE> Florence becomes season's third hurricane  </HEADLINE>
AP Photo FLAC101
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) - A storm off the southeast coast of the United
States gathered just enough strength Tuesday to become Hurricane
Florence, a slow-moving mass of wind and rain blamed for at least
two deaths in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Two swimmers died at Kure Beach, N.C., and seven others were
rescued from strong rip currents that the Coast Guard blamed on the
storm.
</P>
<P>
   One of the swimmers drowned, but it was unclear whether the
other had drowned or suffered a fatal heart attack. Coast Guard
helicopters also were searching for another man after an empty
kayak washed ashore.
</P>
<P>
   ''He didn't have his life preserver on or anything,'' said
Carolina Beach police officer Chris Chafin.
</P>
<P>
   Two beaches were closed.
</P>
<P>
   The storm had sustained winds of about 74 mph, the minimum
necessary for a hurricane. At 11 p.m. EDT, it was centered about
330 miles south-southeast of Cape Hatteras, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The storm was moving northwest at 5 mph and was not expected to
reach land through Friday, according to the National Hurricane
Center in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's still more or less meandering; there's no established
motion,'' said hurricane specialist Stacy Stewart. ''We expect it
will gradually turn north and northeast and start moving away from
the U.S. coast.''

<HEADLINE> Cardinals 11, Pirates 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Darryl Kile won his fourth consecutive start
and Mike Matheny drove in three runs Tuesday night as the St. Louis
Cardinals beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 11-1.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire grounded to shortstop in the first inning, making
him 1-for-4 with one home run in five plate appearances since he
was activated from the disabled list last week.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who can't play the field because of patella tendinitis
in his right knee, was listed as a left fielder and was replaced by
Craig Paquette after the top of the first.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with Cincinnati's 2-1 loss to Chicago, the Cardinals
lowered their magic number for clinching the NL Central to eight.
St. Louis has won nine of 12, opening a 10-game lead, the largest
among the six division leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Kile (18-9) allowed an unearned run and five hits in seven
innings, returning following a 1-hour, 44-minute rain delay in the
third.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Serafini (2-4) gave up five runs and nine hits in five
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Tatis put St. Louis ahead with an RBI double in the
first, and the Cardinals made it 4-0 in the second on run-scoring
doubles by Edgar Renteria and Craig Paquette along with Matheny's
RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Tatis homered in the fifth off Serafini, and Matheny connected
in the sixth off Matt Skrmetta.
</P>
<P>
   Renteria made a run-scoring throwing error in the sixth on Alex
Ramirez's grounder to shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis increased the lead to 11-1 in the seventh, helped by
errors by third baseman Enrique Wilson and center fielder Adrian
Brown. Shawon Dunston, Renteria and Paquette hit run-scoring
singles and Matheny had an RBI double.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Renteria extended his hitting streak to 12 games. ... The
Pirates have lost four consecutive games since a season-best
eight-game winning streak. ... The Pirates made three errors after
going 54 consecutive innings without one.

<HEADLINE> Packers Pleased for Next Generation  </HEADLINE>
By ARNIE STAPLETON
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Fullback Matt Snider knows full well that
he might not be around Green Bay long enough to enjoy a refurbished
Lambeau Field.
</P>
<P>
   But he was thrilled Tuesday night when Brown County voters
approved a highly contested referendum to renovate the NFL's
second-oldest stadium.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the vote, the 43-year-old stadium is expected to
be remodeled and expanded in time for the 2003 season.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers said the $295 million project was needed to keep the
team competitive and allow it to remain in Green Bay, the NFL's
smallest city but the one with the most championships of any team
in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think all of us players are excited about it,'' Snider said
from a bar stool at Stadium View Sports Bar and Grill in Green Bay,
where proponents gathered to await results.
</P>
<P>
   ''For many of us, me included, there's no guarantee we're going
to be around in 2003,'' Snider said. ''But more than the players,
it's a big deal for Green Bay. This is the most historical city in
the NFL. To think of Green Bay without the Packers, that's a sad,
sad thought.''
</P>
<P>
   And one that won't have to cross anybody's mind again for a
long, long time.
</P>
<P>
   The project will add 10,000 seats to the stadium, where every
game has been sold out since 1960. That will allow the team to lop
off a large chuck of its season-ticket waiting list.
</P>
<P>
   ''People have grandchildren and sons and daughters who won't be
able to get into the games until 40, 50 years from now,'' wide
receiver Antonio Freeman said. ''I personally think it's a good
thing for the community, for the organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The predictions of a close vote had team president Bob Harlan
doing some last-minute campaigning at a shopping mall before
casting his ballot.
</P>
<P>
   But Snider said he and many of his teammates never doubted the
referendum would pass.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know there was a lot of opponents, but there was just no way
this team could leave Green Bay,'' he said.

   Just the thought of the Packers pulling up stakes made him
quiver.

   ''When players walk through that tunnel on game day, you get the
chills and you think about the players who played here and the
coaches who were here on the sideline in those old films.

   ''You think of Vince Lombardi and Bart Starr and now, Brett
Favre,'' Snider said. ''And then you walk out on that field and you
think of the frozen tundra, the tradition.

   ''It would have been very, very sad to have to leave the city.''

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Florence Claims 2 Lives  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A storm off the southeast coast of the United
States gathered just enough strength Tuesday to become Hurricane
Florence, a slow-moving mass of wind and rain blamed for at least
two deaths in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Two swimmers died at Kure Beach, N.C., and seven others were
rescued from strong rip currents that the Coast Guard blamed on the
storm.
</P>
<P>
   One of the swimmers drowned, but it was unclear whether the
other had drowned or suffered a fatal heart attack. Coast Guard
helicopters also were searching for another man after an empty
kayak washed ashore.
</P>
<P>
   ''He didn't have his life preserver on or anything,'' said
Carolina Beach police officer Chris Chafin.
</P>
<P>
   Two beaches were closed.
</P>
<P>
   The storm had sustained winds of about 74 mph, the minimum
necessary for a hurricane. At 11 p.m. EDT, it was centered about
330 miles south-southeast of Cape Hatteras, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The storm was moving northwest at 5 mph and was not expected to
reach land through Friday, according to the National Hurricane
Center in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's still more or less meandering; there's no established
motion,'' said hurricane specialist Stacy Stewart. ''We expect it
will gradually turn north and northeast and start moving away from
the U.S. coast.''

<HEADLINE> Cheney Sells Off Halliburton Shares  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican vice presidential candidate Dick
Cheney sold 660,000 shares of Halliburton Co. worth about $35
million in August, his spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The sale was a standard divestiture of securities, and not
connected to the election, said the spokesman, Dirk Vande Beek.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after being tapped by GOP presidential candidate Gov.
George W. Bush, Cheney retired as chief executive of Halliburton
Co., an oil services company based in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ''These were already vested options, and he cashed them in,''
Vande Beek said.
</P>
<P>
   The shares were valued at about $35 million, according to
documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and
Cheney received an $18.3 million profit from the sale, which
occurred in late August.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney still holds options to buy 500,000 shares of Halliburton
stock at prices ranging from $28.13 to $54.50 per share. The
options expire between 2007 and 2009.
</P>
<P>
   At Friday's closing price of $53.64 a share, the Halliburton
stock would be worth $67.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Cheney sold 100,000 shares for an estimated $5.1
million.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney recently announced that, if elected, he would forfeit any
options that have not been vested by the time he assumes office.

<HEADLINE> 2 Vt. Lawmakers Ousted Over Gay Law  </HEADLINE>
By ROSS SNEYD
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- At least two Republican state lawmakers
who voted for Vermont's law creating civil unions for gay couples
were ousted in Tuesday's primaries, and two others were trailing
badly.
</P>
<P>
   At least three GOP legislators who backed the
first-in-the-nation law appeared headed for victory.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the deep split in Vermont over the law, a Democrat
who voted against the bill lost to a challenger who supported it.
</P>
<P>
   The primaries represented the first opportunity voters have had
to register their views since the Legislature earlier this year
enacted the closest thing in America to gay marriage. The law gives
gay couples all the rights and benefits available under Vermont law
to married couples.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen Statehouse primary races were expected to turn
almost exclusively on a legislator's vote for or against civil
unions. Most of those races involved Republican incumbents who
backed the law.
</P>
<P>
   One of the chief authors of the bill, House Judiciary Committee
chairman Thomas Little, a Republican, beat back a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   But the two biggest casualties among the law's supporters were
Marion Milne, who represents six conservative towns, and John
Edwards, who serves on the Judiciary Committee and represents a
couple of small towns on the Canadian border. Both had been
targeted by opponents of civil unions.
</P>
<P>
   Milne said that she knew when she cast her vote that it might
lead to her defeat but that she did the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   Signs imploring voters to ''Take Back Vermont'' have dotted the
Vermont landscape.
