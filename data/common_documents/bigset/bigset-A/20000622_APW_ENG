Anti-Terrorism Center Set-Up in Russia
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- At their one-day Kremlin summit on Wednesday, the leaders of
the Commonwealth of Independent States established a joint anti-terrorist center
and moved ahead with long-stalled plans for a free-trade zone. The center, which
is to coordinate efforts to combat organized crime and insurgencies throughout
the former Soviet republics, will be located in Moscow and headed by a general
from the Russian Federal Security Service, a KGB successor agency.

House Vote Affects Gun Agreement
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a blow to the landmark agreement among the nation's
largest gun maker, the Clinton administration and hundreds of communities, the
House voted Wednesday to bar the federal government from helping to attract more
muncipalities to the pact. By a 218-207 vote, the House voted to prevent the
government from spending any money for the Communities for Safer Guns Coalition.
In return for Smith &AMP; Wesson's promise to use gun-safety devices and sales
practices, the 411 localities that have so far joined the coalition have agreed
to make the company's firearms the preferred gun for their law enforcement
agencies.

Bush Supports Oil Price Probe
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- George W. Bush voiced support for an investigation of
soaring gasoline prices, but he put most of the blame on the Clinton
administration's failure to convince foreign crude producers to ''open the
spigots.'' ''I do think it's fair to have the FTC (Federal Trade Commission)
investigate,'' Bush told reporters Wednesday, adding that the results would be
''healthy'' for the debate about prices that have climbed above $2 per gallon in
Chicago and Milwaukee. His Democratic rival for the presidency, Al Gore,
countered that Bush has come late to the issue.

OPEC Is Hiking Oil Output
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- OPEC members agreed Wednesday to boost official crude
oil production by 3 percent, a move unlikely to provide U.S. drivers with
summertime relief from record-high gasoline prices. Ten OPEC members voted to
increase the group's daily quota by 708,000 barrels beginning July 1. ''Gas will
stay as tight as ever, and it will only come down when the driving season
ends,'' said Leo Drollas, chief economist for the London-based Center for Global
Energy Studies.

Jury Hears 911 Tape in Davidian Case
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WACO, Texas (AP) -- The panic and terror within the walls of the Branch
Davidian complex were relived Wednesday as the audiotaped drama of the first
moments of the government's 1993 raid was played in a multimillion-dollar
wrongful death trial. ''There are 75 men around us and they are shooting at us
at Mount Carmel!'' sect member Wayne Martin screamed in the telephone. ''Tell
them there are children and women in here and to call it off!'' The exchange was
captured on 911 tapes by the McLennan County Sheriff's Office, whom Martin
called when shooting started on Feb. 28, 1993.

Fla. Executes Man Who Had Reprieve
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   STARKE, Fla. (AP) -- A man who killed a bailiff in a 1984 courtroom shooting
and thought he was Jesus Christ was executed by injection Wednesday, one day
after he received a reprieve while strapped to the gurney in the death chamber.
Thomas Provenzano had been granted the stay yesterday, 11 minutes before the
scheduled execution. A three-judge panel U.S. Court of Appeals in Atlanta, which
had given no reason for its stay, dissolved the order this morning and Gov. Jeb
Bush rescheduled the execution.

Rockies Defeat Reds 6-4
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Neifi Perez and Darren Bragg singled home runs and Ken
Griffey Jr.'s throwing error let in another as the Colorado Rockies rallied in
the eighth inning for a 6-4 victory Wednesday over the slumping Cincinnati Reds.
Colorado got its eighth victory in 11 games by taking advantage of another wild
performance by reliever Scott Williamson (2-4), who's failing to duplicate his
NL rookie of the year season. The Reds have lost 12 of 14, failing to win
consecutive games since June 3-4. The tailspin has dropped them a distant second
in the NL Central.

<HEADLINE> President helps raise soft money for wife's Senate bid  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - President Clinton played the role of
''surrogate-in-chief'' Wednesday night, helping to raise $200,000
for his wife's New York Senate campaign at a private reception for
wealthy donors.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told the two dozen people - who had paid $10,000 or more
each to attend - that Hillary Clinton would make a good senator
because she understands the problems faced by working parents.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the whole cluster of family issues will be very big in
the next decade,'' Clinton told the group at the Georgetown home of
two top Democratic donors. ''She spent 30 years working on this
stuff ...
</P>
<P>
   ''In a lot of ways, she's better than I am. She knows some
things I don't know. She will do a great job at this.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raiser was hosted by Elizabeth Frawley Bagley, a former
Clinton ambassador to Portugal, and her husband, R.J. Reynolds
tobacco heir and foundation president Smith Bagley. The Bagleys had
come under criticism earlier this year for having Elian Gonzalez,
the Cuban refugee boy at the center of a bitter custody battle,
visit their posh home.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not mention Gonzalez or Cuba in his remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, Clinton spoke at a fund-raiser for the Irish
American Democrats, a group that has pledged to give his wife's
campaign $10,000 and a similar amount to Vice President Al Gore's
bid for the White House. The Irish group gave top Democratic
fund-raiser Terry McAuliffe an award, and Clinton spoke of his role
in the negotiations that led to the Protestant-Catholic power
sharing agreement in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ''None of the elitists thought we ought to do it, but all us
blue-collar rednecks thought it was a good idea,'' Clinton told the
crowd of about 150, who had paid up to $1,000 each to attend.

<HEADLINE> Watson looking forward to week without Tiger  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLIFTON, N.J. (AP) - Given the state of golf, Tom Watson is
enjoying life on the Senior PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   With you-know-who not eligible for another 26 years, it's fun to
play every week and have a chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   Watson and everyone else weren't doing that last week at the
U.S. Open as Tiger Woods romped to a record-setting 15-stroke win
at Pebble Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was the only story last week with the exception of Jack
Nicklaus possibly retiring from the U.S. Open and never playing
again,'' Watson said Wednesday after playing in the pro-am for the
Cadillac NFL Golf Classic on the Senior tour.
</P>
<P>
   ''But like Johnny Miller said, he may have played the best
tournament of golf in the history of the game,'' Watson added.
''Those players out there are playing for second place it seems
like. I was playing for second place.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson even joked that while he finished two dozen shots behind
Woods, he was only nine shots out of second place, a spot that he
is quite familiar with this season.
</P>
<P>
   In eight events on the Senior Tour, Watson has finished second
four times. He has lost twice in multiple-player playoffs, first to
Lanny Wadkins in the ACE Group Classic and then to Tom Kite in six
extra holes at The Countrywide Tradition.
</P>
<P>
   While that sounds like a great start, it's not what Watson
expected after joining the Senior Tour in September and winning a
tournament two weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   His desire to get off to a fast start this year was slowed by
the death of his father and a broken heel he sustained jumping over
a fence.
</P>
<P>
   ''My putting wasn't very good at the beginning of the year, but
right now it's starting to turn around and I'm putting pretty
well,'' Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   Watson also likes his chances this week on the tree-lined Upper
Montclair Country Club, one of those old courses that requires
players to use almost every club in their bags.
</P>
<P>
   He's been close and had his chances. If he continues to play the
same way, he feels he has a chance to win - at any tournament
without Tiger.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think I've lost any intensity,'' Watson said. ''I
enjoyed the U.S. Open last week and I enjoyed the Masters. I don't
think it's a conceited statement, but I think I can play with some
of these kids. There's one kid I can't play with, but most of the
kids out there I think I can compete with. I believe in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Competing with Woods is another story.
</P>
<P>
   Watson said Woods is dominating golf the way Nicklaus did back
in his prime. The only difference Watson said is that Woods' short
game is better.
</P>
<P>
   While that may make for boring golf in terms of who is winning,
Woods is great for the game, Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Look at the television ratings, look at the people who have
gone into the game of golf, the non-golfers who have gone into the
game of golf, the diversity and ethnicity of the people he is
bringing into the game,'' Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's great. It's wonderful. The game is really popular because
of Tiger,'' Watson added. ''It's going to continue to be. He is the
Michael Jordan of the sports world right now, I think.''

<HEADLINE> Phillies 10, Mets 5  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Pat Burrell hit his first career grand slam, his
second key ninth-inning homer off Armando Benitez in as many
nights, to lead the Philadelphia Phillies to a 10-5 win over the
New York Mets on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Burrell, who hit a game-tying homer off Benitez on Tuesday when
Philadelphia won 3-2 in 10 innings, also homered in the sixth
inning for the rookie's first career multihomer game.
</P>
<P>
   The last-place Phillies have won seven of eight against the
Mets, dating to last season. They have also won five of six during
the past week against New York and Atlanta, the top two teams in
the NL East.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia blew a 5-3 lead in the eighth before rallying
against the Mets' bullpen in the ninth. Doug Glanville led off with
an infield single off John Franco (2-3) and went to third on Ron
Gant's double. One out later, Franco intentionally walked Mike
Lieberthal to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Franco then fell behind Kevin Jordan 3-0 before walking him on a
3-2 pitch that was just high. Manager Bobby Valentine threw his gum
on the dugout steps in disgust and the Shea Stadium crowd booed as
Franco was replaced by Benitez.
</P>
<P>
   Burrell then homered to left-center, sending the Mets faithful
scurrying to the exits.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Gomes (4-4) got five outs for the win.
</P>
<P>
   Burrell's fifth homer of the season gave the Phillies a 4-3 lead
against Al Leiter. Gant, who went 4-for-5 with a homer and two
doubles, made it 5-3 with a solo shot in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Curt Schilling allowed three runs in the first two innings --
including a mammoth home run by Mike Piazza -- before settling down
with five scoreless innings.
</P>
<P>
   But Philadelphia's bullpen cost Schilling the win. Derek Bell
led off the eighth with a single off Chris Brock. Edgardo Alfonzo
then battled through a 10-pitch at-bat before lining a single to
left-center, sending Bell to third. Alfonzo stole second base as
Piazza struck out and both runners scored on Robin Ventura's single
off Mark Holzemer.
</P>
<P>
   In his last start against the Mets last season, Schilling took a
4-0 lead into the ninth inning before losing 5-4 on a two-run
single by John Olerud. This time, the Mets didn't take nearly as
long to get to Schilling.
</P>
<P>
   After the first two batters of the game struck out looking,
Alfonzo drew a walk. Piazza then turned on a high fastball and hit
a towering shot that bounced off the railing of the middle deck in
left and back onto the field for his 20th homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets went ahead 3-0 in the second on Jason Tyner's RBI
grounder before the Phillies tied it with three runs in the third
on Lieberthal's two-run double and a sacrifice fly by Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter, who had won his last three starts, allowed five runs --
three earned -- and eight hits in 6 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Mets SS Rey Ordonez is out for the season because his
broken left forearm is not healing properly. He had been expected
back by the All-Star break. ... Scott Rolen walked in his first
three at-bats. ... Bell went 0-for-3 off Schilling and is 1-for-24
against the right-hander for his career. ... Burrell had been
5-for-26 off left-handers, including strikeouts in his first two
at-bats against Leiter, before homering. ... Phillies OF Bobby
Abreu didn't start for the second straight game as punishment for
showing up late Tuesday. He entered in the ninth as a defensive
replacement.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox 9, Yankees 7  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD ULMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Yankees relievers Jason Grimsley and Mike Stanton
couldn't find the plate. Red Sox runners did it five times in the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   After wasting a lead in the top half of the seventh inning,
Boston rallied in the bottom half to beat New York 9-7 Wednesday
night after sleeping through the first two games of the series.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, coming off 22-1 and 3-0 wins, overcame a 4-2
deficit in the seventh on a run-scoring error by second baseman
Jeff Frye, an RBI grounder by Chuck Knoblauch -- making his first
start with New York at designated hitter -- and a sacrifice fly by
Paul O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   Grimsley (3-2) relieved David Cone starting the bottom of the
inning, Nomar Garciaparra singled and Carl Everett walked.
</P>
<P>
   One out later, Scott Hatteberg's groundout tied it. Grimsley
then walked Brian Daubach intentionally and Manny Alexander
unintentionally, loading the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton, who had walked just six batters in 32 innings coming,
walked Jose Offerman on four pitches and Jeff Frye on a 3-2 count
as Boston took a 7-5 lead. Trot Nixon followed with a two-run
double over the head of O'Neill in right.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams hit a two-run homer in the ninth off Derek Lowe,
just the third homer the reliever has allowed in 41 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Garces (3-0) pitched a scoreless inning as Boston stopped a
four-game losing streak and closed within a half-game of the
Yankees, who lead the AL East.
</P>
<P>
   Cone, just 1-6 in 14 starts, threw a run-scoring wild pitch in
the first and allowed Everett's RBI grounder following Nixon's
wind-blown triple over Williams in center.
</P>
<P>
   New York tied it on RBI singles by Chris Turner in the fifth off
Pete Schourek and Jorge Posada in the sixth off Hippolito Pichardo.
</P>
<P>
   Boston went ahead in the sixth on Alexander's RBI single and
Frye's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Frye singled in his third at-bat, one night after his
13-game hitting streak ended. ... Nixon was irate after he was
called out by John Hirschbeck on a close play in which Cone dropped
a throw from Posada, who was playing first, then picked it up as
Nixon hit the base. ... The Yankees hit just two balls out of the
infield in the first four innings against Schourek. ... Knoblauch
went 1-for-5.

<HEADLINE> Giants 4, Cardinals 1  </HEADLINE>
By R.B. FALLSTROM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Kirk Rueter outdueled Garrett Stephenson, and
Doug Mirabelli's home run snapped an eighth-inning tie as the San
Francisco Giants beat the St. Louis Cardinals 4-1 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Rueter (5-4), from nearby Hoyleton, Ill., raised his record at
Busch Stadium to 5-0 with a 2.06 ERA in seven career starts. He
worked seven innings, allowing a run on four hits with five
strikeouts and three walks.
</P>
<P>
   It was another quiet night for Barry Bonds and Mark McGwire, the
1-2 home run hitters in the majors with 26 and 25. Bonds, who
struck out all three times Tuesday, was 1-for-3 and hit by a pitch.
McGwire, whose next homer will tie him with Mike Schmidt (548) for
seventh place on the career list, singled in the first, walked
twice and popped out.
</P>
<P>
   Mirabelli was in an 0-for-13 slump before leading off the eighth
against Stephenson with his fifth home run, a drive that barely
cleared the left-field wall. The Giants added another run when
Jesse Orosco hit J.T. Snow with two outs and the bases loaded.
Marvin Benard singled home a run in the ninth to make it 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Stephenson (9-3) allowed three runs on five hits in 7 1-3
innings with seven strikeouts and a walk, losing for the first time
to an NL team. He has lost three of four starts, and was 8-0 before
losing interleague games to Cleveland and Detroit on June 3 and
June 9.
</P>
<P>
   Stephenson, who entered the game 0-for-23 at the plate, drove in
the Cardinals' only run with a two-out bloop single in the second
that barely eluded first baseman Snow and right fielder Ellis
Burks.
</P>
<P>
   Stephenson was 6-for-88 for his career (.068) before getting his
second career RBI. The hit drove in Eric Davis, who led off the
inning with a double that made him 18-for-40 against left-handed
pitching.
</P>
<P>
   After that hit, Rueter didn't allow another one until Ray
Lankford singled to start the seventh. Robb Nen worked the ninth
for his 11th save in 15 chances.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants got their first hit off Stephenson in the fifth, a
leadoff double by Snow, and he scored on Rich Aurilia's sacrifice
fly to the wall in center. Jim Edmonds, who climbed the wall to rob
Burks of a home run Tuesday, had another nice effort with an
over-the-shoulder catch, banging into the wall a few steps later.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Rueter, who's 50-31 with the Giants, has allowed four
earned runs in 19 2-3 innings his last three starts. ... The
Cardinals were averaging 6.8 runs for Stephenson, second-best in
the majors. ... The loss was only the second in nine games for the
Cardinals, who held their 6 1-2 game lead in the NL Central as
Cincinnati lost.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Gary Sheffield hit two homers, including a
tiebreaking solo shot in the eighth inning that lifted the Los
Angeles Dodgers over the Houston Astros 7-6 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, who went 4-for-5, had his third multihomer game of
the season and 18th of his career. He has 23 homers, third in the
NL behind Barry Bonds (26) and Mark McGwire (25).
</P>
<P>
   Jose Cabrera (0-2) gave up Sheffield's game-winner just hours
after arriving from Triple-A New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, who has three homers in two nights, scored four runs,
tying his career high, set Sept. 16, 1995 at Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Herges (5-0) pitched three hitless inning to win for the
second straight night. The Astros, whose 25-45 record is the worst
in the major leagues, dropped to 3-16 in one-run games and 12-21 at
Enron Field.
</P>
<P>
   There were five homers, boosting the total at Enron Field to 107
in 33 games, 11 fewer than were hit all of last season in the
Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   Houston starter Octavio Dotel, winless since beating Milwaukee
on May 1, led 6-3 in the seventh before Shawn Green's sacrifice and
Eric Karros' two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Barker hit a solo homer in the third, the second of his
career. The Astros chased Carlos Perez in the fourth, taking a 6-3
lead on Julio Lugo's two-run homer, his first in the majors, and
Jeff Bagwell's two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   Perez allowed six runs and seven hits in 3 2-3 innings. Dotel
gave up six runs -- five earned -- and 11 hits in 6 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Consecutive singles by Mark Grudzielanek, Sheffield and Green
scored one run in the first inning, and Dotel's throwing error on a
pickoff try scored another run for a 2-0 Dodgers lead.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield also homered in the third inning to make it 3-1.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Sheffield's other multihomer games this season were April
29 against the Mets and June 3 against the Angels. ... Mitch
Meluskey needs two homers to become the eighth Astros rookie to hit
double-digit home runs in a season. ... Green has reached base
safely in 66 of the Dodgers' 69 games. ... Jim Leyritz, obtained by
the Dodgers from the New York Yankees on Tuesday, won't be in
uniform until Thursday's game against the Astros.

<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Jim Thome homered twice to reach 20 for a seventh
straight season and Kenny Lofton tripled, doubled and singled as
the Cleveland Indians cooled off the Chicago White Sox for the
second straight night, 8-6 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   White Sox ace James Baldwin (10-2), whose other loss was May 26
to the New York Yankees, was pounded for six runs and eight hits in
four-plus innings, his shortest outing of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago, which had won eight straight before the consecutive
losses, still holds a 6&AMP;frac12;-game lead over Cleveland in the AL
Central.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Ramirez also homered for Cleveland, while Frank Thomas
homered twice for Chicago and Paul Konerko once. Konerko was
4-for-5.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Burba (8-2), who has won five of his last six decisions,
allowed four runs and seven hits in 5 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Lofton led off the game with a triple, Omar Vizquel doubled,
Roberto Alomar sacrificed and Thome hit a long homer to
right-center.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago closed to 3-2 in the bottom half on two-out RBI singles
by Magglio Ordonez and Konerko, but Ramirez homered in the second
and Cleveland made it 7-2 in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Alomar tripled and scored on Lofton's single, and Vizquel
singled off first base umpire Brian Runge, sending Lofton to third
and finishing Baldwin.
</P>
<P>
   After Vizquel was picked off by Kevin Beirne, Roberto Alomar hit
a sacrifice fly and Thome followed with another long drive to right
center, the 12th multihomer game of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Konerko hit a two-run homer in the sixth, Chris Singleton beat
out an infield hit and Justin Speier relieved, escaping the jam
when pinch-hitter Carlos Lee popped out with two on.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Alomar hit a run-scoring double-play grounder in the
seventh for an 8-4 lead. Thomas hit a solo shots in the seventh and
ninth for his 16th multihomer game.

Notes: With at least 20 homers in seven straight seasons, Thome
tied the club record set by Larry Doby from 1949-55. Thome has 216
homers, tied with Hal Trosky for third on the Indians career list.
... With David Justice and Manny Ramirez out with injuries, Thome
was batting fourth for just the ninth time this season. ... Baldwin
was bidding to become just the third White Sox pitcher to start a

<HEADLINE> Rangers 7, Twins 5  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN HAWKINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Dave Martinez snapped an 0-for-20 slump
with a two-run double as the Texas Rangers beat the Minnesota Twins
7-5 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the Rangers' third in four games after a
nine-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Esteban Loaiza (4-5) pitched six innings and won for the first
time in five starts. He has won four straight against the Twins,
three against Brad Radke (4-9).
</P>
<P>
   John Wetteland allowed one run in the ninth before recording his
18th save in 22 opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's double in the fifth, on a hard-hit grounder that
ricocheted off the foot of Minnesota shortstop Cristian Guzman into
the outfield, snapped a 3-3 tie and put the Rangers ahead for good.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was thrown out trying to stretch his hit into a triple,
but only after Rafael Palmeiro and David Segui scored. Martinez's
slump began after he went 5-for-9 after being acquired by Texas
from the Chicago Cubs in a three-team trade June 9.
</P>
<P>
   Radke's replacement an inning later, Bob Wells, set an American
League record for a pitcher with four fielding chances in an
inning. He made two errors and had assists on the only two outs he
recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Wells dropped the infield popup by Gabe Kapler, the first batter
he faced. While he got the next two batters on 1-3 groundouts, he
also threw a ball into center field while trying to pick off Kapler
at second with nobody covering. Wells was then pulled after a walk
and RBI single by Ivan Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Radke, 2-8 in his career against Texas, allowed five runs on
eight hits over five innings. He struck out two and walked two.
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza, 0-3 with a no decision in his previous four starts,
allowed four runs on eight hits in his six innings. He struck out
three and walked two.
</P>
<P>
   Corey Koskie, 13-for-26 (.500) against the Rangers this season,
hit a solo homer off Loaiza in the sixth. He also hit an RBI single
in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Segui also scored the first two Texas runs, both after he
reached with a double.
</P>
<P>
   After his double in the second, Segui scored on Mike Lamb's RBI
double. Segui led off the fourth with another double and scored
when Guzman made a throwing error on Kapler's grounder that would
have ended the inning. Royce Clayton followed with an RBI single to
make it 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota quickly got back even with an unearned run in the
fifth. Matt Lawton hit an apparent double-play ball, but Clayton
made an errant throw to first after getting the first out. David
Ortiz followed with an RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Greer added an RBI single in the eighth to give the
Rangers a 7-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman hit his major league-leading 13th triple, and scored on
Lawton's RBI infield single off Wetteland in the ninth to make it
7-5.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The game was played without delay in an on-and-off light
rain. ... Martinez was 5-for-32 lifetime against Radke before his
fifth-inning double. ... Loaiza has allowed 22 earned runs over his
last 24 1-3 innings pitched. ... Twins 3B Ron Coomer, out of the
starting lineup for the second straight game after minor foot
surgery Monday, came on as a pinch-hitter in the eighth. He flew
out for the third out with two runners on base. ... Ortiz was
ejected by plate umpire Mike Winters with two outs in the ninth for
arguing balls and strikes.

<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) -- A brush fire spread by windy

Halifax on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries were reported and no houses had caught fire by
Wednesday evening.

<HEADLINE> Pichler Leads 3-Meter Semifinals  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   FEDERAL WAY, Wash. (AP) -- Troy Dumais, denied an Olympic
platform diving berth in 1996 by David Pichler, barely trailed his
rival on the 3-meter springboard Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Pichler, who finished last in springboard qualifying four years
ago, led 12 divers advancing to Thursday night's finals with 682.86
points. Dumais was second with 681.66 points.
</P>
<P>
   In women's 3-meter, Jenny Keim of Miami, a 1996 Olympian, and
Michelle Davison of Columbia, S.C., were 1-2 heading into Wednesday
night's finals.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Ruiz of Orlando, Fla., the heavy favorite to qualify on
both springboard and platform, moved from seventh to fifth. He had
struggled in the morning preliminaries when he hit the board with
his toes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very pleased with my performance,'' Ruiz said. ''I know I
have a chance to make it. I feel very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Dumais, of Ventura, Calif., was third behind Pichler of Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., and Kevin McMahon of Fremont, Neb., going into
his final dive. But he moved up with a pike inward 1&AMP;frac12; somersault
that earned him marks ranging from 9.0 to 9.5 from seven judges.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is going to be the best all-around competition we've had
in a long, long time. Everybody is stepping up and pushing each
other,'' said Dumais, whose brother, Justin, also made the finals.
''When I'm behind I push myself a little more. It's like I get more
of a rush, more adrenaline.''
</P>
<P>
   As a 16-year-old, Dumais finished 39 points behind Pichler at
the '96 trials. Only the top two finishers earn Olympic spots.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not comforting when someone gains 40 points on you,''
Pichler said of Dumais. ''I expected him to gain a lot of ground,
but not as much as he did.''
</P>
<P>
   McMahon, second going into the five-dive semifinal, dropped to
third on his last dive, a forward 1&AMP;frac12; somersault with a twist that
earned mostly 8.0s.
</P>
<P>
   That opened the door for Dumais to move up after coming into the
semifinals in fifth place. He earned two 10s on his second dive,
the same one that cost McMahon second place.
</P>
<P>
   McMahon had 673.32 points, while P.J. Bogart of Mesa, Ariz., was
fourth with 667.20 points and Ruiz totaled 663.72.
</P>
<P>
   Rio Ramirez of Miami, a Cuban defector who is awaiting
permission from his native country to compete for the United States
if he qualifies for the Sydney Games, was ninth, 55 points behind
Pichler.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just thinking about my diving,'' Ramirez said. ''I just
want to do a good performance there and please myself, my coach and
the people who came to watch. I know what's going on, but I can't
think about it.''

<HEADLINE> Suit filed on behalf of three plane crash victims  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) - A lawyer representing the estates of
three people who died in last month's casino junket plane crash has
filed suit against the operator of the charter plane.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Quinn Jr. filed suit Wednesday on behalf of the estates
of Joan Fumanti, Bernard M. Kachinko Sr. and Diane Schwartz.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have our people lined up,'' Quinn said. ''As soon as the
airframe (of the plane) is returned from the manufacturer, we want
to inspect it immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   He confirmed that his office has been speaking with one or two
other families of crash victims to pursue lawsuits against
Executive Airlines and related companies.
</P>
<P>
   Both pilots and all 17 passengers were killed on May 21 when an
Executive Airlines charter plane crashed into a mountain while on
approach to the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board is still trying to
determine the cause of the crash. Investigators have been hampered
because the cockpit voice recorder was not working. In addition,
the plane was not equipped with a flight data recorder; none was
required.

<HEADLINE> Kendall Francois pleads guilty to eight murders to avoid death penalty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. (AP) - Kendall Francois, who admitted
strangling eight women and hiding their bodies in his home, pleaded
guilty Wednesday and avoided a possible death sentence in exchange
for life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Francois, 28, pleaded guilty to all 17 counts of the indictment,
which included 16 murder charges and one count of attempted
assault.
</P>
<P>
   Francois will be sentenced Aug. 7 to life imprisonment without
parole by Dutchess County Court Judge Thomas J. Dolan. He had been
scheduled to go on trial in the fall. It was revealed in court
Wednesday that Francois is HIV positive.
</P>
<P>
   According to court documents, Francois told police he solicited
the women for sex, then strangled them and hid their bodies inside
the garbage-strewn home he shared with his parents and younger
sister. The murders occurred over a 22-month period from October
1996 to August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The former middle school hall monitor was arrested in September
1998 after a woman he had brought to his home escaped. A search of
the family's home found the women's decomposing bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Francois had been considered a suspect earlier by police in the
cases of the missing women, but he had passed a lie detector test
when questioned by police.
</P>
<P>
   Francois admitted killing Sandra French, Catina Newmaster, Wendy
Meyers, Gina Barone, Catherine Marsh, Kathleen Hurley, Mary
Giaccone and Audrey Pugliese. All the women but one had a history
of prostitution and drug abuse, and had been reported missing from
a Poughkeepsie neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1998, Francois tried to plead guilty to the murders,
but Dolan refused the request because the district attorney had not
yet decided if he would seek the death penalty. Francois' lawyers
challenged that ruling as far as the state's highest court, which
upheld it in May.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney William Grady had indicated he would seek the
death penalty against Francois. On Wednesday, Grady said he
accepted the plea in part because of the victims' families who
wanted closure and a guarantee that Francois would die in prison.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Grady said, Francois' psychiatric issues would
weigh heavily during the penalty phase of the trial and would be
difficult to refute, though Francois was not legally insane at the
time of the killings.
</P>
<P>
   ''In addition, many of the families do not want their children
and grandchildren needlessly exposed to the unsettling details of
his case that would be disclosed through a public trial,'' Grady
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kendall Francois' life will be spared but he will answer for
his actions,'' said Francois' lawyers Mark Harris and Glenda Grace.
''We hope that the finality of this sentence will bring some
closure to Kendall and his family and the families of his
victims.''

<HEADLINE> Bronx Dem leader: I could get excited about comptroller run  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - State Assemblyman Roberto Ramirez, the Bronx
Democratic Party chairman and a rising star in New York politics,
said Wednesday he ''could get excited'' about running for state
comptroller in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   But the Puerto Rican-born Ramirez cautioned that given
everything else he wants to do, ''I don't think it is within the
framework of political reality for me to be able to make such a
race.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Ramirez also said in an interview with The
Associated Press that, ''the harder you work, the better you do
your job, the more opportunities come up. And, if opportunities
come up, God knows I'm not shy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez is vacating his Assembly seat at the end of the year to
concentrate on electing Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer as
mayor of New York City next year and revamping the city council
there. He is also working to line up support for the possible run
for governor in 2002 by current state Comptroller H. Carl McCall.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier interview Wednesday on Albany's WROW-AM radio,
Ramirez ruled out a run next year for Bronx borough president or
New York's City Council. He had been mentioned as a possible
candidate for council speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would not hold any elected office for the next two years,''
Ramirez told the radio station.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez, 50, was elected to the state Assembly in 1990 and in
1993 became the first Hispanic elected as a county party chairman
in New York. He surprised the state's political community with his
recent announcement that he would not seek re-election to his
Assembly seat.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez played a key role in helping state Assembly Speaker
Sheldon Silver survive an attempted coup last month by the No. 2
Democrat in the chamber, Michael Bragman. Bragman was stripped of
his post as Assembly majority leader by Silver and there was talk
that Ramirez might take over that job. Instead, Ramirez said he was
quitting the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez' comments about a possible run for state comptroller
came just hours before he hosted his annual Bronx Democratic Party
dinner, a fund-raising event expected to attract more than 1,500
people, including U.S. Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The dinner comes at a time when the Bronx party is under strain
because of a primary challenge to veteran Democratic U.S. Rep.
Eliot Engel from state Sen. Larry Seabrook. Ramirez is backing
Seabrook, who is black in an increasingly black congressional
district. Engel is white.
</P>
<P>
   Should Ramirez become the Democrats' candidate for state
comptroller in 2002, the party ticket could have a minority and New
York City cast to it.
</P>
<P>
   McCall, who has homes in New York City and in Saratoga Springs,
is the only black ever elected to statewide office in New York.
State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, who is white, also lives in
New York City. Spitzer has said he expects to seek a second term in
2002.
</P>
<P>
   Also eyeing the governor's race on the Democratic side is
federal Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo. Anthony Nanula, Buffalo's
city comptroller, has been mentioned as a possible Democratic
candidate for state comptroller.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez made it clear Wednesday that talk of a statewide run by
him is very premature.
</P>
<P>
   ''The real threshold is not when you say you wish to run for
office, it's when people come up to you and say, 'You should run
for office,''' he explained. ''I don't hear a clamor out there for
Ramirez.''

<HEADLINE> State's top court refuses to hear abortion murder case  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - New York's highest court refused Wednesday
to hear the appeal of the first doctor ever found criminally
responsible for the death of a patient through a botched medical
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Without comment, Chief Judge Judith Kaye declined an appeal from
David Benjamin's lawyer to send the case to the full Court of
Appeals for a rehearing of Benjamin's conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin is serving a 25-year-to-life sentence in state prison
for the death of Guadalupe Negron. The mother of four bled to death
soon after Benjamin performed an abortion on her at his Queens
office in July 1993.
</P>
<P>
   It was later determined she had a three-inch rip in her uterus.
The doctor's receptionist testified at Benjamin's trial that the
doctor ignored the woman for more than an hour after the abortion.
She died at a nearby hospital.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the woman's death, Benjamin was facing state
disciplinary charges in connection with his treatment of other
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin's lawyer, Mark Baker of Manhattan, said he will
probably ask the Court of Appeals for ''reconsideration'' of Kaye's
determination. Such requests for another look at a denial of appeal
almost never succeed before the Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said his client refused a plea-bargain offer from
prosecutors involving second-degree manslaughter, a charge that
would have brought Benjamin a prison term of between three and nine
years.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, it was not right for Benjamin to eventually
be found guilty of a charge that he intentionally killed his
patient, Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin's lawyers also argued before a lower court that the
jury at his trial was prejudiced when testimony about his previous
medical history was improperly allowed into evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors countered that Benjamin's treatment of Negron met
the legal test of ''depraved indifference'' murder and the fact he
was a doctor should not mean a lesser penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Queens County District Attorney Richard Brown said the Benjamin
case was the first time that a doctor was found guilty of murdering
a patient during a medical procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today's decision represents a solid victory for patients and
their families, who through the gross and depraved indifference of
their medical practitioners lose their lives or are seriously
injured during a medical procedure,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, such cases of medical treatment gone wrong are
handled through malpractice suits or disciplinary hearings in New
York state.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin, 63, is currently in Green Haven state prison. He will
not be eligible for parole until July 2018. He has lost his medical
license.

<HEADLINE> With BC-HKN--Sabres-Adelphia  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Hopes for a thriving city waterfront ran
high Wednesday with news that Adelphia Communications Corp. and
government leaders had come to terms on an office complex that will
create 1,000 well-paying, high-tech jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today we begin the economic renaissance of downtown Buffalo,''
declared Charles Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Adelphia and state and local officials had been in negotiations
since January over the telecommunication giant's plans to build a
$100 million operations center in the city's Inner Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Adelphia accepted an incentives package worth more
than $120 million that included $50 million from the state, a $12.4
million ''Jobs Now'' grant from ESD, $7 million from Erie County
for a new parking facility and tax credits and exemptions.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was announced by Gov. George Pataki, Mayor Anthony
Masiello, Adelphia owner and chairman John Rigas, his son, Timothy
and a throng of local, state and federal legislators on a balcony
overlooking the future construction site.
</P>
<P>
   ''At least a thousand new jobs right there in what is now a
parking lot,'' said Pataki during his second good-news trip to the
Buffalo area in as many days. On Tuesday, he announced Southwest
Airlines would begin serving Buffalo Niagara International Airport
in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-story Adelphia complex will house Adelphia's entire
operations center for its Business Solutions subsidiary and is
expected to contain a hotel, sports theme restaurant, ice hockey
rink, and retail, entertainment and residential space.
</P>
<P>
   The project is the centerpiece of an ambitious larger
redevelopment plan for the Inner Harbor proposed by Adelphia and
two partners. Planners ultimately envision a lively mix of shops,
restaurants, housing, entertainment and a multimillion-dollar water
attraction featuring fountains and a water screen onto which images
could be projected.
</P>
<P>
   The Rigases, who also operate the NHL Buffalo Sabres, would
build the tower next to the Sabres' playing venue, HSBC Arena,
which Adelphia leases from the county and city.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly changing the terms of the current 30-year HSBC lease,
which has 26 years remaining, had come up during talks but the
lease was left unchanged, Adelphia executive vice president Timothy
Rigas said. Losses at the arena have averaged $15 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   ''We, in the end, decided it wasn't worth holding up this
project for the lease concession,'' Rigas said. Instead, it's hoped
the increased development will generate more revenue for the
Sabres, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki and legislative leaders in April agreed to include $75
million for Adelphia incentives in the state budget, including $25
to forgive a loan obtained to build the arena.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a difficult situation for me, because this is the
first time I've ever approached the public sector to work out a
financial arrangement,'' John Rigas said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 1,000 jobs being created, the office complex
will house Adelphia's current New York workforce of 500. The
company has also committed to creating another 1,000 jobs in New
York state, including 500 in western New York and 500 in
undisclosed locations. The jobs carry average compensation packages
of about $45,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the type of investment, this is the type of commitment
that attracts other high-tech businesses,'' Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   The commitment represents a turnaround for Buffalo, long
dependent on a diminishing blue-collar base.
</P>
<P>
   ''This gives Buffalo a new image, a new identity,'' said
Masiello, ''and a new economic base. It shows the rest of the world
that Buffalo can compete for these state-of-the-art jobs ... It
means so much to the new future of our city.''
</P>
<P>
   Groundbreaking is expected next year. Timothy Rigas said
employees would be added gradually and estimated the entire
1,500-member workforce would be operational within four or five
years.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Government officials seek answers in wake of reported bid for Orion Bus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WHITESTOWN, N.Y. (AP) - The parent company of Orion Bus
Industries is exploring a merger, and a financial news service
report says moving operations out of New York state is a
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   A report issued Tuesday by Stark's News Service of Chicago said
that DaimlerChrysler AG had made a bid to acquire Western Star
Trucks Holdings Ltd. to make it an operating unit of its
Oregon-based Freightliner LLC, but the offer had not yet been
accepted.
</P>
<P>
   The report also said Freightliner, the market leader in heavy
trucks, was contemplating an eventual shift of Orion's transit bus
assembly to South Carolina if it succeeded in acquiring Western
Star.
</P>
<P>
   Western Star, based in Kelowna, British Columbia, would not
identify the third party or other details of the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ''There can be no assurance that any discussions will result in
an agreement or transaction,'' a statement from Western Star said.
''Any proposed transaction would be subject to receipt of all
necessary regulatory and other approvals.''
</P>
<P>
   Orion Bus, which has plants in Whitestown and Rome, does
finishing work on mass-transit buses used by city bus lines
worldwide. It employs more than 700 people at the two sites, and
that fact alone had Mohawk Valley officials, Orion suppliers and
company workers concerned about the local impact of any deal.
</P>
<P>
   Myron Kuchera, president of United Auto Workers Local 2243,
which represents most of the Orion employees locally, said company
officials three weeks ago conducted a ''town hall'' meeting with
local employees and denied the company is for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've been very closed-mouth for months, but we've known
since last spring that this was going on,'' Kuchera said. ''The
bottom line is, if the company decides to move, there is very
little we can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Orion employees at the Whitestown plant said they had heard
rumors about a potential merger. Tim Harrison of Westmoreland, an
employee of Orion for more than seven years, said Freightliner
officials toured the Orion facility a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Armstrong, operations manager at Norbco Inc. of
Westmoreland, an aftermarket parts supplier for Orion, said he
wouldn't be surprised if Orion were bought.
</P>
<P>
   ''They tried to make this thing go,'' Armstrong said. ''They
were ripe for a buyout.''
</P>
<P>
   Orion's business has been booming lately. In December, it was
awarded two contracts worth $125 million from the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority of New York City to provide 125 buses that
run on natural gas and another 125 hybrid diesel-electric buses.
</P>
<P>
   Western Star purchased Orion in 1995, shortly after Orion's work
force had been slashed from 600 to only 65 because of a lack of
orders.
</P>
<P>
   Oneida County Executive Ralph Eannace said his office was
monitoring the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We already have some proposals we've been working on that we
could use to help show any purchaser why they would be well-served
to stay here,'' Eannace said. ''We're just making the outreach (to
DaimlerChrysler) because you have to be proactive in this
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Western Star's statement was made in response to a request from
the Toronto Stock Exchange, which halted trading of Western Star
stock on Tuesday morning because of what Western Star marketing
manager Doug Shand called ''abnormal trading.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The pattern (of trading) did not fit our normal pattern of the
last 12 months. Our shares were up $4.50 on the Toronto Stock
Exchange and up $3 on the American Stock Exchange,'' Shand said.
</P>
<P>
   The American Stock Exchange also halted trading, but trading on
both exchanges resumed Wednesday. By late afternoon, Western Star
was up nearly $1 to just over $19 a share on the Amex.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Population of alewives in Lake Ontario on the rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAPE VINCENT, N.Y. (AP) - Two years after it all but disappeared
from the deep waters of Lake Ontario, the alewife is making a
comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary results of a net survey conducted by the U.S.
Geological Survey and the state Department of Environmental
Conservation conducted in late April and May show the alewife, one
of the favorite meals of salmon, chinook and brown trout, at its
most populous level since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''The population is on its way up,'' said Robert O'Gorman, field
station supervisor of the Lake Ontario Biological Station with the
U.S. Geological Survey in Oswego.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers spent more than 16 hours trawling in 13 different
locations at depths ranging from 30 feet to 475 feet to gather
results. Crews conducted about 100 trawlings of 10 minutes each
between Rochester and Cape Vincent, located at the northeastern
corner of the lake.
</P>
<P>
   A similar survey in 1998 had revealed virtually no alewives, the
lowest level since a harsh winter led to a massive die-off of the
fish in 1976-77.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists maintained that the population of the sardine-size
fish was on the verge of collapse because of predators and a lack
of algae, which the alewives eat.
</P>
<P>
   The DEC had cut the number of salmon it stocked in 1993, but
increased it in 1997 after fishing-dependent businesses blamed
lackluster catches on the cuts.
</P>
<P>
   O'Gorman said the largest population of alewives found in the
study was what is referred to by research agencies as the ''1998
year class,'' meaning fish born that year. He said between 66
percent and 75 percent of the fish caught were 2 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was an enormous number of 2-year-old alewives, and quite
a few 1-year-olds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Gorman said water temperatures are the biggest factor in
determining the survival rate of young fish, which are susceptible
to rapid temperature changes. He said the past two mild winters and
early onset of spring weather each year led to favorable
reproductive conditions.
</P>
<P>
   O'Gorman, who said the climate can explain about 60 percent of
the success, expects the results of next year's survey to be even
more positive for the alewife, which can live up to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   However, Brian F. Lantry, an aquatic biologist with the DEC, is
looking more conservatively at the survey results.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to measure it over time, but it does look good,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lantry said the lake's eastern basin between Oswego and the St.
Lawrence River is still a trouble spot for alewives because of the
water clarity there, which is a result of the infestation of
billions of zebra mussels. The alewife's diet includes algae and
plankton, which also is the diet of the voracious mussels.
</P>
<P>
   Lantry said that despite the increase in the alewife population,
the DEC has set its salmon stocking policy through 2002, and there
have been no discussions of stocking more salmon before then.
</P>
<P>
   O'Gorman said the survey also found a large number of lake
trout, which shows the fish is reproducing.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a major milestone in our efforts to restore the
population,'' he said. ''Lake Ontario is the only lake outside Lake
Superior where you can find this naturally producing fish over a
broad area. It's an amazing feat.''

<HEADLINE> Bragman says he will add to staff pay from campaign fund  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The ex-majority leader of the state Assembly
said Wednesday he will supplement the legislative salaries of his
remaining staff from his personal campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bragman said he will lose 10 staffers from his North
Syracuse district office on Thursday. The workers he once had as
majority leader are being transferred to the Assembly ''central''
staff controlled by the man Bragman tried to oust, Speaker Sheldon
Silver.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman said the five staffers who will remain with him in the
district office will be paid in part from taxpayer money he will
get to run his office. The rest of their salaries will come from
the two campaign funds Bragman accumulated through years of
fund-raising as majority leader. The idea is to keep the staffers'
salaries the same in spite of having his office budget cut from
$1.2 million to $125,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman said he has more than $1.2 million in the two funds.
Even a prolonged need to use his campaign money for his office
expenses would not make much of a ''dent'' in the funds, Bragman
said, though he added that he plans to use new contributions and
volunteers to keep his district office adequately staffed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is absolutely proper to supplement the staff,'' Bragman
said Wednesday. ''When they (the Silver forces) are moving out
their computers, we will be moving in ours. We will be providing
every resource that they take out. As far as I'm concerned, this is
a war and it is a war involving the people of this state knowing
what this speaker and the process is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Bragman said Assembly personnel on Thursday will take away 11 of
13 computers, fax machines and replace the current phone system in
Bragman's district office with a more basic model.
</P>
<P>
   Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, fired Bragman as majority leader
when Bragman went public with his bid to oust Silver as speaker.
While Bragman said he once had more than enough votes among the
Assembly's Democratic majority to depose Silver, Bragman's support
dissolved under pressure from Silver and his partisans and only 19
Democrats publicly voted against Silver on May 22.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman, who once had three dozen staffers as majority leader,
was reduced to running his office on $125,000 a year or about
$70,000 over the rest of 2000. He also lost his $34,500-a-year
stipend as majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman said his district office receives about 250 calls a week
seeking assistance. Constituents should not suffer because he
failed to topple Silver, Bragman said.
</P>
<P>
   Silver spokeswoman Patricia Lynch said Bragman is losing about
$1 million a year in the resources which went with his majority
leader's office.
</P>
<P>
   She said it is ''entirely his choice'' if Bragman wants to pay
staffers out of his campaign funds. When asked if she saw legal or
ethical problems with him doing so, Lynch said, ''it's not mine to
inquire'' about the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said the computers, faxes and other equipment will
eventually end up in the office of the new majority leader. Silver
has said one is unlikely to picked until after November's
legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman also said he would talk to the editorial boards of
newspapers around New York to promote the Democratic Majority
Reform Caucus which the dissident Democrats formed during the coup
attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels say Silver runs the Assembly in an autocratic manner,
leaving rank-and-file Democrats little say or authority.
</P>
<P>
   Silver has downplayed the extent of his Democrats'
dissatisfaction with his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Silver has appointed ''focus groups'' of Assembly Democrats to
discuss various issues and come up with recommendations to Assembly
Democrats on changing some majority procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman said he doubted Silver sincerely wants to open up the
Assembly to meaningful reform. If the focus groups do not amount to
a serious reform effort, Bragman said he would challenge Silver
again after the November elections when Silver must formally be
re-elected to a new term as speaker for the Legislature's 2001-02
session.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am certainly not convinced that the speaker wants to do that
(institute reforms) or is capable of doing that,'' Bragman said.

<HEADLINE> Composer Alan Hovhaness Dies at 89  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Alan Hovhaness, a prolific composer who melded
Western and Asian musical styles to create a unique melodic blend
of his own, died Wednesday. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   Hovhaness died at Swedish Medical Center, according to Gerard
Schwarz, music director of the Seattle Symphony. Hovhaness had been
a composer-in-residence with the orchestra. Schwarz said Hovhaness
had suffered from a severe stomach ailment for the last three
years.
</P>
<P>
   ''His music reflects the kind of gentle, wonderful soul that he
was, but also has the turbulence that one sees in an eruption of a
volcano or a tremendous thunderstorm,'' Schwarz said.
</P>
<P>
   Hovhaness wrote more than 400 pieces, including at least nine
operas, two ballets, more than 60 symphonies, and more than 100
chamber pieces.
</P>
<P>
   His works include ''Lousadzak'' (1944), for piano and orchestra;
''Wind Drum'' (1962), a music-dance drama; ''And God Created the
Great Whales'' (1970); and ''The Way of Jesus'' (1974), a folk
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   He was born Alan Vaness Chamakjian, in Somerville, Mass., in
1911. His mother was Scottish and his father, an Armenian chemistry
professor.
</P>
<P>
   Hovhaness demonstrated musical precociousness at an early age,
devising his own method of notation by age 5. Three years later,
when the family moved to the Boston area, he began studying piano
with Adelaide Proctor and later took instruction from Heinrich
Gebhard.
</P>
<P>
   In 1932, he went to the New England Conservatory on a
scholarship and for two years studied composition there with
Frederick Converse.
</P>
<P>
   His early compositions were thoroughly Western. But the
influences of Eastern musical styles became more evident after he
attended Bohuslav Martinu's master class in composition in 1942 at
the Berkshire Music Center at Tanglewood.
</P>
<P>
   Hovhaness was the first Western composer asked to write music
for an orchestra comprised entirely of Indian instruments. He
served for six months as composer-in-residence at the University of
Hawaii and became a composer-in-residence with the Seattle Symphony
in 1966.

<HEADLINE> Court Rules Against United Airlines  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT ANDREWS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- United Airlines discriminated against
female flight attendants from 1989 to 1994 by requiring them to
stay thinner than their male counterparts, a federal court ruled
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''They wanted attractive, sexy flight attendants,'' said flight
attendant's attorney Edith Benay, referring to United executives.
''It was just lack of respect for women who were doing their job
well, in some cases for many years. All of a sudden, when they
started to gain weight, they were out.''
</P>
<P>
   The 2-1 decision by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals clears
the way for money to be awarded to an undetermined number of the
16,000 stewardesses who worked for United during that time.
</P>
<P>
   Some attendants lost pay when they were suspended or dismissed
for being overweight. Others suffered emotionally and physically as
they struggled to lose weight -- sometimes going so far as fasting
for days or donating excessive amounts of blood, according to
Benay.
</P>
<P>
   The airline eliminated all weight standards in 1994. Benay said
some airlines retain weight standards. But the situation has
changed drastically from the 1960s and early 1970s, when flight
attendants were routinely required to be unmarried, childless women
younger than 35 years old.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for United declined to comment on the ruling. Calls
placed to the airline's Chicago public affairs office after
business hours Wednesday were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   The court said United's weight policy was discriminatory on its
face. The rules required women to stay within the ideal weight
range for women with medium body frames. By contrast, men had it
easy, the court said. Even men with small body frames were free to
bulk up so their weight fell into the range for men with large body
frames.

<HEADLINE> House Vote Affects Gun Agreement  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a blow to the landmark agreement between
the nation's largest gun maker and the Clinton administration, the
House voted Wednesday to bar the federal government from helping to
attract more municipalities to the pact.
</P>
<P>
   By a 218-207 vote, the House voted to prevent the government
from spending any money for the Communities for Safer Guns
Coalition. In return for Smith &AMP; Wesson's promise to use gun-safety
devices and sales practices, the 411 localities that have so far
joined the coalition have agreed to make the company's firearms the
preferred gun for their law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, the House muddled its message by voting 219-206
to reject a second provision that would have forbidden the federal
government outright from enforcing the March 17 agreement between
Smith &AMP; Wesson and the federal and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   The two votes underlined the pressure lawmakers are under on the
hot button issue of guns, especially in an election year.
</P>
<P>
   Since the successful amendment was added to a massive spending
bill that the administration has already threatened to veto, its
fate is shaky.
</P>
<P>
   ''The gun language is just one more problem on what is already a
very bad bill,'' said Linda Ricci, spokeswoman for the White House
budget office.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the first vote was a clear defeat for the White
House and a slap at Andrew Cuomo, the secretary of the Department
of Housing and Urban Development who has been a leader in forging
the gun agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today's callous action by the House of Representatives strikes
at the heart of HUD's ability to work with local communities to
reduce the awful toll of gun violence,'' he said in a written
statement
</P>
<P>
   He added later, ''The House has now proven that it is firmly in
the hip holster of gun lobby extremists.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Hostettler, R-Ind., who sponsored both amendments,
said in an interview afterward that the two votes were ''overall a
win'' because they sent a message that lawmakers don't want the
Clinton administration pushing communities to purchase Smith &AMP;
Wesson weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ''Local law enforcement agencies won't feel pressure from a
federal agency ... in the procurement of firearms'' as a result of
the first vote, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Walsh, R-N.Y., chief author of the spending bill that
Hostettler's amendments were aimed at, said during the debate that
the measure provided no funds specifically for the gun agreement.
That made the amendments ''unnecessary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Hostettler said later that the government often spends money
for activities that are not specified in spending bills, such as
for U.S. troops in Kosovo. With the success of his first amendment,
he said, the Department of Housing and Urban Development would not
be able to issue press releases or have its lawyers help the
coalition of participating communities.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., who led the opposition to
Hostettler's amendments, said the success of his first amendment
was ''absolutely'' a setback.
</P>
<P>
   But she said she hoped the Senate, which has not yet written its
version of the bill, would reject the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Hostettler's language was inserted into a $101 billion measure
financing veterans, housing, environment and space programs for the
coming fiscal year that the House approved by 256-169.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has already threatened to veto the measure
because it would cut some of President Clinton's proposals for
public housing and enforcement of some environmental laws, and
abolish the AmeriCorps national service program.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the gun agreement, Smith &AMP; Wesson agreed to start
installing trigger locks and other gun-safety devices, such as
using ''smart gun'' technology within three years that would allow
only the weapon's owner to use it. In addition, the company agreed
to take such steps as selling guns only after background checks of
the purchaser.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, 411 communities that have so far joined agreed to
make Smith &AMP; Wesson guns the preferred choice for the firearms they
purchase for their law enforcement agencies. They also agreed to
drop the company from lawsuits challenging the gun industry's
safety and marketing practices.
</P>
<P>
   During the debate, Hostettler said the Clinton administration
had used the agreement to score political points, and said
communities following it could end up buying inappropriate weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't allow HUD to override officer safety for the purpose of
a political agenda,'' said Hostettler, using the acronym for the
Department of Housing and Urban Development.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the Smith &AMP; Wesson deal accused Hostettler of
helping the National Rifle Association, which has attacked the
agreement. They also said Hostettler's aim was to get even with the
gun maker, which has been sued by other arms companies in federal
court for an alleged restraint of trade conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   ''His objective is very simple,'' said Rep. Richard Neal,
D-Mass., in whose district Smith &AMP; Wesson is based. ''It's to put
Smith &AMP; Wesson out of business.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Teacher Guilty of Killing Cousin  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BARABOO, Wis. (AP) -- A former teacher was convicted Wednesday of
killing his cousin, whose dismembered, skinned body washed up in a
river last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Kupaza, 40, was convicted of first-degree intentional
homicide and hiding a corpse in the death of Mwivano Mwambashi
Kupaza, 25, a student from Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Sentencing was scheduled for Friday at 9 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The victim's arms, head, legs and torso were found in the water
last July near Spring Green. The skin had been removed from most of
the body, including the face.
</P>
<P>
   During closing arguments, Sauk County District Attorney Patricia
Barrett said Kupaza stood to gain financially from her death and
told a series of lies to try to conceal his guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett said Peter Kupaza was struggling financially to support
himself and his cousin since his 1998 divorce from Shari Goss. He
was working two jobs and was evicted from two apartments before his
cousin's death.

limits were not discriminatory, but had been applied unfairly.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Helps Raise Soft Money  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton played the role of
''surrogate-in-chief'' Wednesday night, helping to raise $200,000
for his wife's New York Senate campaign at a private reception for
wealthy donors.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told two dozen people -- who had paid $10,000 or more
each to attend -- that Hillary Rodham Clinton would make a good
senator because she understands the problems faced by working
parents.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the whole cluster of family issues will be very big in
the next decade,'' Clinton told the group at the Georgetown home of
two top Democratic donors. ''She spent 30 years working on this
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In a lot of ways, she's better than I am. She knows some
things I don't know. She will do a great job at this.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raiser was hosted by Elizabeth Frawley Bagley, a former
Clinton ambassador to Portugal, and her husband, R.J. Reynolds
tobacco heir and foundation president Smith Bagley. The Bagleys had
come under criticism earlier this year for having Elian Gonzalez,
the Cuban refugee boy at the center of a bitter custody battle,
visit their posh home.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not mention Elian or Cuba in his remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, Clinton spoke at a fund-raiser for the Irish
American Democrats, a group that has pledged to give his wife's
campaign $10,000 and a similar amount to Vice President Al Gore's
bid for the White House. The Irish group gave top Democratic
fund-raiser Terry McAuliffe an award, and Clinton spoke of his role
in the negotiations that led to the Protestant-Catholic power
sharing agreement in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ''None of the elitists thought we ought to do it, but all us
blue-collar rednecks thought it was a good idea,'' Clinton told the
crowd of about 150, who had paid up to $1,000 each to attend.

<HEADLINE> Officer Convicted in Louima Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A policeman was convicted Wednesday of lying to
investigators to avoid becoming a ''rat'' in the case against
patrolmen who tortured a prisoner in a precinct house's bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   The jury deliberated two days in Brooklyn federal court before
delivering a split verdict, finding Francisco Rosario guilty of two
counts of conspiring with his partner to make false statements to
the FBI six weeks after the 1997 assault of Abner Louima. He was
acquitted of a third count that charged he lied again in a later
interrogation.
</P>
<P>
   Rosario became the sixth officer to either be convicted at trial
or plead guilty in one of the worst brutality scandals in city
history. The 1997 attack on Louima, a black Haitian immigrant,
sparked protests and prompted a Justice Department investigation
into whether the New York Police Department fosters abuse of
minorities by not cracking down on excessive force.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had accused Rosario of lying because he ''did not
want to be labeled a rat.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Richard Levitt said Rosario would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Rosario faces up to five years in prison; no sentencing date was
set.

<HEADLINE> Man Convicted in Road Shooting  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN MANNING
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHESTERTOWN, Md. (AP) -- Jurors found a man guilty of
first-degree murder Wednesday in the shooting death of a
73-year-old woman who was riding home with two other black women
from a Christmas shopping trip.
</P>
<P>
   David Starkey claimed the shotgun fired twice accidentally,
while prosecutors, who had dropped hate crimes charges against the
two white brothers, claimed the killing of Germaine Clarkston was
intentional.
</P>
<P>
   ''The defendant had to think about what he was doing when he
broke open that weapon, loaded it, took off the safety and pulled
the trigger,'' prosecutor Christopher Eastridge said in closing
arguments Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After their arrest Dec. 9, the brothers told police they had
been deer hunting and drinking the afternoon of Dec. 4. They were
on their way to register a deer they had killed when they came
across the three women, who were returning home after shopping in
Delaware. The two told police they were angered by Wilson's slow
and erratic driving, and authorities said they followed the women
for more than 20 miles.
</P>
<P>
   The defense maintained Starkey only meant to scare the women,
and the shotgun went off accidentally when he pointed it out the
window of the truck his brother, Daniel, was driving.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Starkey was convicted of second-degree murder and
attempted murder last week. The brothers will be sentenced Aug. 11.
David Starkey could be sentenced to life in prison without parole.
</P>
<P>
   The jury also found Starkey guilty of two counts of first-degree
attempted murder for shooting the driver, Michelle Wilson, and the
other passenger, Meriam Spriggs. The two counts carry a maximum
sentence of life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Clarkston relatives shouted with joy as they left the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ''Justice has been served, but it really doesn't solve our
problem,'' said Linwood Clarkston Jr., Germaine Clarkston's son.
''She was a mainsail to our family. To this point, we've been
listing in the water. It's going to take a long time for us to get
over it.''

<HEADLINE> Woman Who abandoned baby Convicted  </HEADLINE>
By JAMES WEBB
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELVIDERE, Ill. (AP) -- A young woman who admitted she abandoned
her newborn in a neighbor's snowy backyard and kept the secret for
more than three years was convicted Wednesday of involuntary
manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors rejected a first-degree conviction against Kelli Moye,
now 20, despite the prosecution's contention that she knew the
little girl was likely to die when she left her outside hours after
giving birth on Feb. 9, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Moye looked up at the ceiling as Judge Rosemary Collins read the
jury's verdict and breathed deeply. Relatives hugged and wept in
relief. Jim and Sue Moye expressed hope their daughter would be
home soon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the jury did a great job and they chose the right
verdict,'' her father said.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the body, two days after she was left outside,
stunned residents of Poplar Grove, a town of about 750 people
surrounded by farmland 70 miles northwest of Chicago. They named
the baby Angelica Faith and gave her a proper burial, but the
mystery of her birth and death persisted until Moye was arrested
last fall after a fight with Michael Mirshak, the child's father.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Moye didn't tell anyone about the birth -- not
even Mirshak -- because it didn't fit in with her plans to keep him
as her boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Debra Schafer said prosecutors were trying to
put a sinister spin on the actions of a scared teen-ager who
couldn't bring herself to tell her parents and did tell her
boyfriend -- only to be told to get rid of the baby.
</P>
<P>
   ''She felt isolated and alone, and she made a bad choice with
very tragic results,'' Schafer said. ''But that does not
necessarily make her guilty of a criminal offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Moye testified that she placed the infant outside hours after
delivering her in secret as her parents slept at their home and was
too afraid of being caught to check on the child. Mirshak was a
prosecution witness and has not been implicated in the baby's
death.
</P>
<P>
   Moye's parents had contacted police initially after learning
their daughter was the mother of the baby.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a father it was the hardest thing in the world to do, to
turn your daughter in for murder,'' Jim Moye said. ''I kind of
regretted it, but now I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Moye could have faced up to 60 years in prison if convicted of
first-degree murder, but Schafer said she expects a sentence of two
to 10 years for her client.

<HEADLINE> Angels 3, Royals 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Jarrod Washburn took a two-hit shutout
into the ninth inning, and Darin Erstad had a home run, three RBIs
and game-saving catch to lead the Anaheim Angels over the Kansas
City Royals 3-1 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn (3-1) allowed four hits in 8 1-3 innings, struck out
three and walked one. After he gave up a pair of ninth-inning
singles, Troy Percival relieved and allowed an RBI single to Carlos
Beltran.
</P>
<P>
   Jermaine Dye then was robbed of a three-run homer by Erstad, who
leaned against the short fence in the left-field corner and made
the catch as a fan nearly knocked the ball away. Mike Sweeney flied
out, giving Percival his 18th save in 23 chances, just his fifth in
his last nine.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City had averaged seven runs in its previous seven
meetings with the Angels this season.
</P>
<P>
   Mac Suzuki (3-1) allowed all three runs and six hits in seven
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn and Suzuki both had one-hitters through the first 4&AMP;frac12;
innings, until Anaheim's Adam Kennedy -- batting ninth for only the
third time in 65 starts this season -- singled with two outs in the
fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad followed with his 14th homer. After two more hits, Suzuki
struck out Tim Salmon with runners at the corners.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy tripled off the center field fence in the seventh for
only his fifth hit in 33 career at-bats against the Royals, and
scored on Erstad's groundout.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Tim Belcher, scheduled Thursday to make his second start
since coming off the disabled list, has an 0-7 career record
against the Royals. Kansas City is the only AL league team the
14-year veteran right-hander has never defeated. Belcher has beaten
every NL team except Arizona and Colorado, the only two he has
never faced. ... Erstad, who has 54 RBIs in 69 games, is trying to
become the first leadoff batter in Angels history with 20 homers
and 100 RBIs. ... Kansas City recalled OF Mark Quinn from Triple-A
Omaha and sent INF Ray Holbert outright to Omaha. ... Washburn's
only other shutout in professional ball was on July 23, 1997, for
Double-A Midland against Shreveport. ... Angels RHP Ken Hill, on
the disabled list since May 10 because of a strained muscle in his
right ribcage, is penciled in to start next Wednesday at Seattle.
... Angels RHP Jason Dickson, sidelined since May 15, was examined
Wednesday by Dr. Lewis Yokum at the Kerlan-Jobe Clinic and had an
MRI that showed additional wear on the right labrum in his
shoulder. Dickson will continue therapy, and no timetable has been
set for him to throw again.

<HEADLINE> Cardinal Egan challenges media to investigate truth  </HEADLINE>
By HADLEY PAWLAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOLTON LANDING, N.Y. (AP) - In his first public appearance as
Roman Catholic archbishop of New York, Edward Michael Egan pledged
to be open and forthcoming with reporters - in most cases.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to assure you that I want to be as open to you as I
possibly can,'' Egan said at the New York State Broadcasters
Association conference Wednesday night. He urged members of the
media to call him if he violates that promise.
</P>
<P>
   ''I must be willing to cooperate with you openly and honestly if
I expect the same excellence and honesty in your reports,'' Egan
told the broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some things that will remain off limits, said
Egan, 68. Specifically, he won't talk about court cases or pending
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you are before the judge in a court case you are going to
be expected to be silent until the case is resolved,'' Egan said.
</P>
<P>
   Egan, who led the diocese of Bridgeport, Conn., for 12 years,
has refused comment about more than 20 lawsuits pending against
that diocese. In those cases, several people claimed they were
molested by priests when they were altar boys or members of
diocesan youth organizations. The alleged incidents occurred before
Egan was bishop there.
</P>
<P>
   He said that in 42 years in the clergy he has never found the
media to intentionally report falsehoods but, ''unfortunately
misinformation gets out.''
</P>
<P>
   He talked about ''lawyers' shocking fiction,'' hitting the news
pages as truth only to ultimately be exposed as lies. Reputations
can be ruined, Egan said, but when the truth comes out, ''it's on
the back page or before the next commercial.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He really challenged the press tonight,'' said Joseph Reilly,
executive director of the NYSBA. ''Maybe we don't have to be the
first one on the air if we're the rightest one on the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Egan said Americans - and specifically the media - have a
special duty to tell the truth. ''It is essential if our nation is
to be strong and secure.''
</P>
<P>
   Egan succeeded Cardinal John O'Connor as spiritual leader of 2.4
million Roman Catholics in the New York archdiocese. It is
considered the most prominent Catholic post in America. O'Connor
died of brain cancer May 3 after serving as archbishop for 16
years.
</P>
<P>
   The archdiocese covers Manhattan, Staten Island, the Bronx,
Westchester and surrounding suburban counties.

House Committee OKs GOP Medicare Plan

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tending to a vital election-year issue, House Republicans
forced committee approval for their Medicare prescription drug legislation
Wednesday night over the implacable opposition of Democrats. The 23-14 vote was
strictly along party lines on the bill, which envisions a blend of free-market
insurance plans and government subsidies to spread coverage nationwide. The vote
set the stage for what is likely to be a tough struggle next week on the House
floor on a measure Republicans have been warned by a GOP pollster is a

<HEADLINE> Justice Sought for S. Leone Rebel  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The U.N. Security Council and West African
states have agreed on the need to bring Sierra Leone's rebel leader
Foday Sankoh to justice and to investigate illicit diamond sales
that have financed arms purchases by his rebel force.
</P>
<P>
   Britain told Liberia -- identified as the key transit point for
illegal diamond exports and arms shipments to Sankoh's rebels --
that its actions threatened to undermine efforts to restore peace
to Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting took place Wednesday between the council and six
members of the Economic Community of West African States -- Ghana,
Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Nigeria and Togo. They discussed a common
approach to restoring peace, dealing with rebels, diamonds and
arms, and bringing to justice those who have flouted last July's
peace agreement with renewed fighting in May.
</P>
<P>
   ''There isn't 100 percent agreement between ECOWAS and the
Security Council, or even within the Security Council on every
element,'' said British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock, ''but our
fundamental agendas are the same,''
</P>
<P>
   Britain has formally proposed that the Security Council
institute an embargo on the sale of Sierra Leone diamonds not
authorized by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Greenstock said he told Liberia's Foreign Minister Monie Captan
that his country's current activities ''were potentially and
perhaps actually a major threat to what we're trying to do to put
Sierra Leone together.''
</P>
<P>
   Captan took it ''on the chin,'' Greenstock said. Diplomats added
that the Liberian minister told the council his government was
ready to cooperate with any inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Britain has also proposed expanding the U.N. force in Sierra
Leone from 13,000 to 16,500 as recommended by Secretary-General
Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
   ECOWAS Executive Secretary Lansana Kouyate said the
organization's members are prepared to contribute 3,000-3,5000
troops ''provided that we will get sufficient logistics and
financial support.''
</P>
<P>
   Both ECOWAS and the Security Council want those responsible for
breaking the Lome peace agreement that ended Sierra Leone's
eight-year civil war to be brought to justice. But differences
remain on the scope and nature of any war crimes trials.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement broadcast Wednesday on state-run radio, the
Sierra Leone government asked the Security Council to establish a
special war crimes court based in the country but operating under a
blend of national and international law to prosecute Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is backing Sierra Leone and is drafting a
Security Council resolution, but it was unclear if it would be
limited just to Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
   Kouyate said the peace agreement gives immunity to Sankoh and
his Revolutionary United Front for previous atrocities, but they
have no immunity from actions since last July. ECOWAS has already
started an investigation on responsibility for recent cease-fire
violations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think ECOWAS have yet reached the point of deciding
what type of procedure they want,'' Greenstock said. ''But it was
clear from them that they want Foday Sankoh tried ... if the
charges are as they look at the moment.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Missile Talks Upcoming  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- The United States is set to announce negotiations
with North Korea to stop the development and export of the
communist country's missile technology.
</P>
<P>
   If the talks succeed, shipments to Iran, Pakistan and possibly
other nations could end, thereby easing concerns about a growing
threat to the United States and its friends and allies.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations, due to be announced shortly, follow a decision
by North Korea to extend a moratorium on missile flight tests.
</P>
<P>
   But a senior U.S. official, briefing reporters on a fast-growing
relationship between the United States and the once-secluded and
hostile government in Pyongyang, said Washington still faced a
threat of missile attack by North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, President Clinton will not be deterred in
considering the start of an expensive missile defense program, the
first phase of which is designed with North Korea in mind, said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Also due soon is an announcement of a visit by a high-level
North Korean official to Washington as well as talks to reaffirm
North Korea's pledge to halt a nuclear weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Clinton administration lifted a 50-year embargo
on trade with North Korea, permitting American companies and
individuals to trade with and transfer money to North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea responded Wednesday, extending by nine months its
moratorium on missile tests, according to a Foreign Ministry
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will have a positive effect on Washington high-level
talks,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Phil Reeker said, ''We
welcome the North Korean statement and the continued restraint by
Pyongyang.''
</P>
<P>
   While the two sides also will hold a new round of talks on
terrorism, North Korea remains on the State Department's list of
sponsors of terrorism. Under U.S. law, that prohibits most U.S. aid
and requires Washington to oppose World Bank loans to North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright arrived
Thursday in Beijing for talks with Chinese leaders. She began her
visit by seeing Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan for a luncheon
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   After shaking hands with Tang at the Diaoyutai State Guest
House, Albright said she had ''lots of things to discuss,'' but did
not raise specifics. Reporters were not permitted to sit in on the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Meetings are scheduled later in the day with Vice Premier Qian
Qichen and Premier Zhu Rongji. Albright was scheduled to meet
Chinese President Jiang Zemin Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   She was to fly Friday to Seoul, South Korea, for an update on
the first meeting of the heads of North and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The summit last week in Pyongyang produced an agreement between
South Korea's Kim Dae-jung and North Korea's Kim Jong Il to work
for peace and unity on their bitterly divided peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   The North Korean leader held talks in Beijing before the summit.
Albright intends to press the Chinese, who helped set up the
summit, for more information about him, his economic policy and
whether he is committed to peace on the Korean peninsula, a second
senior U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
   The moves toward reconciliation between the two Koreas raised
questions bout the continued presence of some 37,000 U.S. troops in
South Korea as a barrier to invasion from the north. Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, has called on the Clinton administration to begin
considering a pullout.
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials and other key members of Congress
said the threat remains and so should the troops, which cost the
United States an estimated $3.2 billion a year to maintain.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting China for the first time since March 1999, Albright was
given access to a wide range of top officials, including President
Jiang Zemin, even though the trip was hastily arranged.
</P>
<P>
   She was beginning by seeing Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan, with
Vice Premier Qian Qichen and Premier Zhu Rongji scheduled later.
</P>
<P>
   She is bracing for tough questions about a U.S. missile defense,
especially with tensions easing between North and South Korea, said
the U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   China has warned that erecting a missile shield in violation of
a 1972 U.S.-Soviet treaty could touch off a new nuclear weapons
race.
</P>
<P>
   Albright also expects to be quizzed about the talks President
Clinton held in Moscow three weeks ago with Russian President
Vladimir Putin.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Reconstruction a Struggle  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WARREN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA GUAIRA, Venezuela (AP) -- When rain seeps through his family's
tent, Adan Liendo feels helpless.
</P>
<P>
   Six months after mudslides destroyed his home and killed 15,000
people along Venezuela's coast, Liendo and his family still live in
a crowded disaster relief camp. As the rainy season begins, once
again soaking the unstable flanks of nearby Mount Avila, Liendo is
getting desperate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need a place to live -- something better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dec. 15 disaster left 100,000 people homeless. Most found
housing nearby or moved in with relatives, and the government has
moved about 5,500 people to new houses elsewhere in Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   But 7,500 still remain in temporary shelters and tents huddled
among blasted-out buildings in the coastal state of Vargas.
Unemployment has soared because businesses were destroyed. Crime is
on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   Liendo, 23, lives with his wife and three children in a
12-foot-by-12-foot tent, packed in with 130 others on a former
sports field in La Guaira.
</P>
<P>
   Work crews have cleared the nearby coastal road, but the beach
where fishermen once cast their lines is now covered with
hard-packed, desolate earth. It juts out 200 feet farther than it
once did, onto a churning, brown sea littered with concrete, iron
scraps, refrigerators and other mudslide debris.
</P>
<P>
   Squabbles between President Hugo Chavez's government and the
Vargas state government over control of relief funds have slowed
reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Vargas Gov. Alfredo Laya announced the state had run
out of funding. He said he had no choice but to freeze rebuilding
efforts and fire 5,500 employees -- many of them landslide victims.
</P>
<P>
   State work crews that had begun building wooden homes for Liendo
and other families stopped work, leaving behind piles of lumber.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Laya led 2,000 Vargas residents in a protest in the
capital to demand the federal government hand over $194 million so
the state can continue reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's government defends its efforts, saying it has spent
millions of dollars on clearing buried roads and cleaning river
channels.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I had to start this process again, knowing what I knew six
months ago, I would do everything the same way,'' said Technology
Minister Carlos Genatios, who directs federal reconstruction
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   He said the government has focused on designing a $1.2 billion
reconstruction plan and preparing other communities to accept
Vargas refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Liendo lost his job as a security guard in the
state's layoffs. Bilmania Silva, 44, fears she might also lose her
$150-per-month job at the state comptroller's office.
</P>
<P>
   The insecurity has led to crime, exacerbated by the breakdown of
communities as neighbors and families have scattered.
</P>
<P>
   Silva said no work has begun on two projects her community
desperately needs -- construction of a tunnel to drain water safely
to the sea, and removal of trash left by the mudslides.
</P>
<P>
   Filthy water now runs through an enormous, trash-filled channel
carved out during the flooding near Silva's front porch. As Silva
spoke, her neighbor threw half a mattress by the stream and walked
away.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents have given up and accepted the government's offer
to move away.
</P>
<P>
   Marcos Morales, 35, now lives in the western town of Guarumito,
where on Saturday Chavez inaugurated more than 100 new homes for
mudslide victims.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think I'm going to go back,'' he said. ''The
government has given us very comfortable and dignified homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in Vargas, authorities have warned that some areas may
never be habitable again because of the risk of landslides. In
Carmen de Uria, where an estimated 2,000 people are buried in the
rubble, the government has prohibited construction and said it will
build a park to commemorate the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Silva says she knows the danger in Vargas state is real.
</P>
<P>
   ''When it rains, we don't sleep -- we're worried that the river's
going to carry us away,'' she said. But she said she cannot bear to
leave her home state.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been here so many years,'' Silva said. ''I was born here,
and I don't want to leave.''

<HEADLINE> Prince William Misses Celebration  </HEADLINE>
By AUDREY WOODS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Unlike many members of his family, Prince William
will be rising early Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The elder son of Prince Charles and the late Princess Diana, who
turned 18 on Wednesday, will be getting up, after an early night,
to take his final exam in Art History.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Windsor's golden boy was not in attendance
Wednesday as 700 guests danced and sipped champagne into the wee
hours during a night of birthday celebrations at Windsor Castle.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first songs struck up by the band at the black-tie
event reportedly was the favorite of the Queen Mother Elizabeth,
whose 100th birthday falls on Aug. 4 -- ''A Nightingale Sang in
Berkeley Square.''
</P>
<P>
   The royal mega-party was held to celebrate five milestone
birthdays in the year 2000 -- those of the queen mother and Prince
William, along with Princess Margaret's 70th, Princess Anne's 50th
and Prince Andrew's 40th.
</P>
<P>
   The party in the State Apartments at Windsor Castle, which rises
above the River Thames 25 miles west of London, began with a dinner
for about 80 friends, including royalty from Spain, Belgium and
Norway and former King Constantine of Greece, who now lives in
north London.
</P>
<P>
   The dinner guests were later joined by about 700 others for
drinks and dancing, with three bands designed to cater to all
tastes -- a big band, a swing band and a pop band.
</P>
<P>
   Among the guests was Sarah, Duchess of York -- the first time
since the 1997 funeral of Princess Diana that the ex-wife of Prince
Andrew has been included on the royal guest list.
</P>
<P>
   William, who finishes his studies at Eton -- just across the
river from Windsor -- later this summer, is taking the exams that
determine university entrance.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to study art history, probably at Edinburgh University,
after taking a year off to work or travel. And he has decided to
postpone until after university the use of the designation His
Royal Highness, which usually is conferred at age 18.
</P>
<P>
   That means he won't have to be called ''sir'' and needn't be
bowed and curtsied to. He has said he wants to be known simply as
William.
</P>
<P>
   Official birthday photos and TV film released last week showed a
relaxed and informal young man at ease with his friends at school.
And they also provided a vivid reminder that Prince William is the
tall, blond and handsome image of his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Like Diana, William faces a life of international celebrity. And
when he leaves Eton, he leaves the protection of the press
guidelines for minors set out by the press self-regulatory body,
which bans intrusive coverage of the young.
</P>
<P>
   With opinion polls offering mixed results on the monarchy's
future, William's arrival on the public scene could bring new
support from the younger generation, which is the least
enthusiastic about the royals.
</P>
<P>
   William already seems headed down a more approachable path,
putting off his HRH, enjoying his school days away from royal
confines and apparently avoiding the traditional Oxford or
Cambridge education of the upper classes.

<HEADLINE> Pitcher Optioned 1 Day After Recall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- In a move that paves the way for the promotion of
top prospect Tomo Ohka, who pitched a perfect game for Pawtucket on
June 1, the Boston Red Sox returned lefty reliever Tim Young to the
International League team Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Ohka is expected to start Friday night in Toronto, taking the
spot of Jeff Fassero who was placed on the disabled list Monday
with weakness in his left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Ohka became the third player in the 117-year history of the
International League to pitch a perfect game. He was 6-5 with a
2.73 ERA for Pawtucket.
</P>
<P>
   Ohka was a combined 15-0 with Double-A Trenton and Triple-A
Pawtucket last season, his first in U.S. professional baseball,
before being promoted to Boston, where he was 1-2. He played
professionally in his native Japan in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Young had been recalled from Pawtucket on Tuesday and didn't
pitch for Boston before being optioned.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Greg Vanney scored on a penalty kick
with two minutes to play in regulation as the Los Angeles Galaxy
salvaged a 1-1 tie with the Chicago Fire on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Referee Kevin Terry awarded the Galaxy (7-3-7) the penalty kick
after Jesse Marsch pushed Mauricio Cienfuegos to the ground in the
penalty area.
</P>
<P>
   Fire goalkeeper Zach Thornton dove to the right on the penalty
kick, but Vanney put the shot inside the right post for his fourth
goal of the season, all on penalty kicks.
</P>
<P>
   Josh Wolff put the Fire (9-7-2) ahead in the 75th minute, taking
Diego Gutierrez's pass and shooting just inside the left post for
his fifth goal. Former Galaxy forward Ante Razov also was credited
with an assist.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Armas nearly gave Chicago a 2-0 lead in the 83rd minute,
but Los Angeles forward Cobi Jones, standing on the goal line next
to the left post, cleared Armas' shot.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff had the best scoring opportunity of overtime, capping a
counterattack in the 94th minute with a shot from just inside the
penalty area, which Los Angeles goalkeeper Kevin Hartman dove to
the ground to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago led 16-10 in shots and 7-6 in shots on goal before an
announced crowd of 10,271 at the Rose Bowl. Thornton and Hartman
each made five saves.
</P>
<P>
   The tie continued the Galaxy's slump since the league began to
force the team to divest players May 13 so high-scoring Mexican
forward Luis Hernandez could be added to the roster.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles is 2-3-4 after opening the season 5-0-3. Hernandez
has yet to score in six MLS matches and one in the U.S. Open Cup.

<HEADLINE> Witnesses: Skakel admitted involvement in murder  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) - Lawyers for Kennedy cousin Michael Skakel
next week will present witnesses to dispute former classmates of
Skakel's who claimed he confessed to killing his teen-age neighbor
in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Two men who attended a residential substance abuse treatment
center with Skakel in the late 1970s testified this week that
Skakel admitted killing 15-year-old Martha Moxley.
</P>
<P>
   Their testimony came during a reasonable cause hearing to
determine whether there is enough evidence to try Skakel and
whether his case will be transferred from juvenile to adult court.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel was 15 at the time of the killing. Now 39, he was
arrested in January after a grand jury consisting of a single judge
found there was probable cause to charge him in the long-dormant
case.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel's attorney, Michael Sherman, told Judge Maureen Dennis
Wednesday that he will call several former students at Elan to
testify about whether Skakel ever made any admissions at the Elan
school in Poland Spring, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm confident that once the judge hears the whole story, she
will have a different picture,'' Sherman said.
</P>
<P>
   The defense is expected to begin its case June 28.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Sherman grilled one of the Elan students who
testified for the state.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Coleman testified earlier that Skakel told him he beat
Moxley's skull in with a golf club after she rejected his romantic
advances. He said Skakel told him: ''I'm going to get away with
murder. I'm a Kennedy.'' Skakel's father, Rushton Skakel Sr., is
the brother of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy's widow, Ethel.
</P>
<P>
   During cross-examination, Coleman admitted that he had told the
grand jury that Skakel confessed to him five times, when actually
he only confessed to him twice. Coleman also said that he heard
Skakel admit to the murder during a ''primal scream'' group therapy
session.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman admitted he sometimes has trouble with his ability to
recall.
</P>
<P>
   But he adamantly stood by his testimony that Skakel told him he
killed Moxley.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know what I heard upon initially meeting Michael Skakel ...I
am sure of that - not 99.9 percent but 100 percent,'' Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman also highlighted Coleman's longstanding drug and alcohol
abuse, and ran through Coleman's criminal record, including a 1983
conviction for robbery and a 1999 conviction for trespassing.
Coleman is serving a year in prison on that count.
</P>
<P>
   In other testimony Wednesday, a childhood friend testifying for
prosecutors said that Skakel admitted being at the scene where
Moxley was murdered.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Pugh said Skakel told him years later that he had
masturbated in a pine tree in Moxley's yard the night she was
murdered, Oct. 30, 1975. It was the same pine tree Moxley's
bludgeoned body was found under the next morning, Pugh said.
</P>
<P>
   Pugh said that when they were kids, he and Skakel frequently
climbed an enormous pine tree on the Moxley property, which was
located across the street from the Skakel family estate in Belle
Haven, an exclusive gated community in Greenwich.
</P>
<P>
   Pugh said he lost touch with Skakel after Moxley's death.
</P>
<P>
   He said Skakel tried to renew their friendship in the early
1990s, but that he told Skakel he was reluctant because he had some
concerns about Skakel's possible involvement in Moxley's murder.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Pugh said he asked Skakel if he had anything to
do with the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Pugh said Skakel told him he had been in the pine tree
masturbating the night Moxley was killed, ''but that he had nothing
to do with her death.''
</P>
<P>
   That account is similar to what Skakel told a private
investigative firm hired by his family in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with Sutton Associates, Skakel changed the story
he originally gave to police. He originally said he was at his
cousin's house at the time investigators believe Moxley was killed.
But he told Sutton Associates that after he returned home that
night, he climbed a tree outside Moxley's window, threw rocks to
awaken her and masturbated in the tree. He said he ran home when he
heard voices.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman suggested repeatedly that Skakel never told Pugh that
the pine tree they climbed as kids was the same tree Skakel told
him he climbed the night of Moxley's killing.
</P>
<P>
   Pugh acknowledged that he assumed Skakel was referring to the
tree where Moxley's body was found, but he did not come right out
and say it was the same tree.
</P>
<P>
   Pugh said Skakel had ''an attraction, an infatuation'' with
Moxley.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also called Judith Kallen, from the state Department
Children and Families, who said the juvenile system does not have
any facilities to treat, hold or rehabilitate someone after they
reach the age of 18.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law in effect in 1975, Skakel could face a maximum of
four years if he is convicted as a juvenile. If he is convicted as
an adult, he could get 25 years to life.

<HEADLINE> Mariners 8, Devil Rays 5  </HEADLINE>
By JIM COUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- John Olerud's three-run double and Alex
Rodriguez's two-run double highlighted a seven-run second inning in
the Seattle Mariners' 8-5 victory over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays on
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Esteban Yan (4-5), who was charged on the mound by Mark McLemore
the last time he pitched in Seattle, pitched to seven batters in
the second without getting an out.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Sele (8-3) improved his career record against the Devil
Rays to 5-0, including 3-0 this season. But he left the game after
he walked Fred McGriff and gave up a double to Bobby Smith to start
the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Kazuhiro Sasaki pitched the ninth for his 12th save in 14
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Yan triggered a bench-clearing melee in his last start at Safeco
Field on May 20 when he threw a pitch between McLemore's legs after
McLemore called time out and was out of the batter's box. McLemore
charged the mound and was thrown out of the game. The Mariners
second baseman began serving a four-game suspension Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In his rematch with the Mariners, Yan had his worst control of
the season, walking a season-high five and hitting a batter.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners took their 7-0 lead in the second on second baseman
Smith's fielding error on a grounder by John Mabry, a bases-loaded
walk to Mike Cameron, Rodriguez's double over center-fielder
Quinton McCracken's head and Olerud's bases-clearing double.
</P>
<P>
   McGriff hit a two-run homer off Sele in the fourth, a 419-foot
shot over the center-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays scored two runs in the fifth. Gerald Williams hit
a grounder to third baseman Mabry, who committed two errors on the
play. Mabry bobbled the ball and then threw the ball into the
stands. Mike DiFelice scored from third base and Felix Martinez
came home from second.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, DiFelice's sacrifice fly cut Tampa Bay's deficit
to 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   Rickey Henderson singled in a run for Seattle in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Sele, the highest-paid Mariners player at $7.5 million, gave up
five runs, four earned, on five hits and four walks with six
strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Yan was charged with seven runs, six earned, on three hits and
five walks in his one inning.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Yan hit David Bell with a pitch in the second for his
eighth hit batter of the season, the second-most in the AL. Doug
Creek hit Jay Buhner in the fourth, giving the Devil Rays a major
league-leading 32 hit batters. ... Yan averaged 2.4 walks in his
first 14 starts this season. ... Yan was booed when he was
introduced by the crowd of 27,555, and was booed when he left the
game. ... When the Mariners batted around in the second, it was the
ninth time they've done that in an inning this season. ...
McGriff's homer was the 404th of his career and second of the
series. It was his 18th career homer against the Mariners. ... RHP
Freddy Garcia, a 17-game winner as a rookie for the Mariners last
season, pitched four innings in Salem, Ore., for Single-A Everett
in his first of two rehabilitation assignments in the minors.
Garcia has been on the DL since April 16 because of a fractured
right tibia. The Mariners hope Garcia can pitch July 1 against
Texas.

   LONDON (AP) -- Police were interrogating suspects in three
countries Thursday in an attempt to trace the route of a
people-smuggling operation that led to the deaths of 58 Chinese
migrants during a doomed bid to reach Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The 58 victims and two survivors were discovered late Sunday
amid a cargo of tomatoes in an airtight truck. The victims died of
respiratory failure.
</P>
<P>
   Police in the English port of Dover, where the bodies were
found, said they were holding two London-based Chinese suspected of
being involved in the smuggling gang. The pair, a man and a woman,
were not believed to have played a senior role, a police source
told The Guardian newspaper on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Belgian and British police were checking fingerprints of a group
of Chinese migrants fitting the description of the victims who were
detained in April in villages of Bornem and Puurs.
</P>
<P>
   After fingerprinting the group, Belgian authorities ordered them
to leave and placed them unescorted on a train to Antwerp.
</P>
<P>
   The migrants disappeared, and some may have ended up among the
victims at Dover.
</P>
<P>
   Belgian authorities were still holding three Asian men arrested
after the April discovery, London's Times newspaper reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The public prosecutor's office in Mechelen, Belgium, said the
three were awaiting trial on charges of human trafficking and
making false passports. A fourth man had also been arrested but
later was released.
</P>
<P>
   None of the dead has yet been positively identified, Kent county
police said Wednesday. Wah-Piow Tan, a London lawyer who represents
Chinese asylum-seekers, said he had been approached by dozens of
illegal immigrants from China's Fujian province who could be key to
identifying the victims. But he said they were afraid to come
forward for fear of deportation.
</P>
<P>
   ''My clients are in a gray area,'' he said, quoted in The
Guardian. ''Some of them are awaiting the result of asylum
applications and others have been refused asylum but have not yet
departed.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is required of the Home Office is a political,
humanitarian decision to grant exceptional leave to remain to
anyone who comes forward with information that can help the police
identify these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Dutch police on Wednesday arrested the owner of the trucking
company that carried the illegal immigrants. The man, identified
earlier as Arie van der Spek, gave himself up Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   A 55-year-old man also is under arrest in the Netherlands, and
police are interrogating the truck's Dutch driver at Dover.
</P>
<P>
   The truck that carried the 58 to their deaths was so full that
eight other stowaways were turned away.
</P>
<P>
   Tan said one of the eight alerted his family in China's Fujian
province that he had not made the disastrous final leg of the
journey to England.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sixty-eight people were supposed to board that truck, but
eight were bumped off because it was so full,'' Tan said in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of them called his family when he heard of the deaths to
let them know that he was all right. He'd been swearing and cursing
when he wasn't allowed on the truck.''
</P>
<P>
   The two survivors, who remained hospitalized under guard, were
briefly questioned Wednesday by specially trained police officers
using interpreters, Kent police said.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair told Parliament on Wednesday the
tragedy ''emphasizes yet again the need to take action at an
international and, in particular, at a European level.''

   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Eric Chavez hit for the cycle, the first
in Oakland Coliseum history, and the Athletics defeated Mike
Mussina and the Baltimore Orioles 10-3 Wednesday night to complete
a three-game sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Ariel Prieto (1-1), called up from the minors earlier in the
day, pitched five strong innings to earn his first win in the
majors since June 26, 1997 in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Prieto, who made his major league debut with the A's in 1995,
spent most of the past two seasons on the disabled list after
having ''Tommy John'' surgery on his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Terrence Long had three hits and drove in three runs as the A's
extended their winning streak to a season-high eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's feat was the third in Oakland history -- Tony Phillips
did it on May 19, 1996 in Baltimore, and Mike Blowers did it in
Chicago on May 18, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez doubled in the second, singled in fourth and tripled in
the fifth -- all against Mussina. He then hit a 1-1 pitch from Jose
Mercedes over the center-field fence for his 12th homer in the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Mussina, who allowed eight runs in his last four starts
combined, gave up a season-high eight runs on 12 hits in 4 2-3
innings, his second-shortest outing of the season. It was the most
runs Mussina (5-7) allowed since giving up 10 last April 21 at
Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Mussina struck out six and walked one and had his personal
four-game winning streak -- in five starts -- snapped. The Orioles
lost their fifth straight.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles scored twice against Prieto in the first.
</P>
<P>
   With one out, Mike Bordick was safe on a fielding error by right
fielder Jeremy Giambi and scored on Delino DeShields' single. B.J.
Surhoff drove in DeShields with a single.
</P>
<P>
   Prieto allowed two hits over the next four innings as Oakland
rallied.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Grieve's single in the first scored Long, and Ramon
Hernandez hit a sacrifice fly to score Giambi with the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   Consecutive doubles by Long and Randy Velarde produced two more
runs in the fourth, then the A's broke it open with four runs in
the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Tejada hit an 0-2 pitch from Mussina over the 388-foot
sign in left center for a two-run shot. After Hernandez drove in a
run with his second sacrifice fly, Long hit his ninth homer of the
season, ending Mussina's night.
</P>
<P>
   Grieve added an RBI double in the eighth for Oakland's final
run.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Johnson drove in a run in the ninth with an RBI single
for Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Oakland DH John Jaha missed the game with the flu. ... LHP
Mike Magnante threw a simulated game in the bullpen before
Wednesday's game, throwing 20 pitches. He's expected to start a
rehab assignment at Triple-A Sacramento on Friday. ... RHP Luis
Vizcaino was optioned to Sacramento to make room for Prieto. ...
Orioles' RHP Mike Trombley missed the first two games of the series
with a throat infection. He remained in the team hotel on Tuesday,
but was available Wednesday. ... CF Brady Anderson was back in the
lineup after missing the last two games with a sore left
quadriceps. ... Mussina has only allowed eight or more runs seven
times in 270 career starts. ... Mussina's shortest outing of the
season was a 4 1-3 stint against Anaheim on May 4. ... Surhoff
extended his hitting streak to 15 games. ... Long extended his
hitting streak to a career-high 11 games. ... Tejada extended his
hitting streak to a career-best 10 games. ... The A's last swept
the Orioles at home in a four-game series in 1989.

   SAN LEANDRO, Calif. (AP) -- Three government food inspectors were shot to
death Wednesday as they visited a sausage factory that had recently reopened
after being closed for health violations. Police took the factory's owner -- who
had railed against the government -- into custody. A fourth inspector escaped
unharmed from the Santos Linguisa factory in San Leandro, about 20 miles
southeast of San Francisco, San Leandro Police Lt. Dan Marchetti said. The
bodies of two inspectors for the U.S. Department of Agriculture and a state meat
inspector were found inside an office inside the plant.

House Committee OKs GOP Medicare Plan

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tending to a vital election-year issue, House Republicans
forced committee approval for their Medicare prescription drug legislation
Wednesday night over the implacable opposition of Democrats. The 23-14 vote was
strictly along party lines on the bill, which envisions a blend of free-market
insurance plans and government subsidies to spread coverage nationwide. The vote
set the stage for what is likely to be a tough struggle next week on the House
floor on a measure Republicans have been warned by a GOP pollster is a
''political imperative'' for the coming campaign.

''surrogate-in-chief'' Wednesday night, helping to raise $200,000 for his wife's
New York Senate campaign at a private reception for wealthy donors. Clinton told
two dozen people -- who had paid $10,000 or more each to attend -- that Hillary
Rodham Clinton would make a good senator because she understands the problems
faced by working parents. The fund-raiser was hosted by Elizabeth Frawley
Bagley, a former Clinton ambassador to Portugal, and her husband, R.J. Reynolds

House Vote Affects Gun Agreement

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a blow to the landmark agreement among the nation's
largest gun maker, the Clinton administration and hundreds of communities, the
House voted Wednesday to bar the federal government from helping to attract more
muncipalities to the pact. By a 218-207 vote, the House voted to prevent the
government from spending any money for the Communities for Safer Guns Coalition.
In return for Smith &AMP; Wesson's promise to use gun-safety devices and sales
practices, the 411 localities that have so far joined the coalition have agreed
to make the company's firearms the preferred gun for their law enforcement
agencies.

<HEADLINE> Keim, Davison Earn Diving Berths  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   FEDERAL WAY, Wash. (AP) -- Jenny Keim is going back to the
Olympics. Michelle Davison earned her first berth the hard way.
</P>
<P>
   Keim, a 22-year-old from Miami, won the trials with 860.31
points Wednesday night. Davison, of Columbia, S.C., took the other
spot with 844.59 points.
</P>
<P>
   In the men's 3-meter semifinals, Troy Dumais of Ventura, Calif.,
was first and David Pichler of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., was second.
</P>
<P>
   Keim is hoping to improve on her ninth-place finish in the 1996
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm hoping that this will turn out a little better,'' she
said. ''I didn't compete quite as well as I wanted to. All in all,
I think this will be a much better experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Rojohn of Fort Lauderdale, who was competing in her
first trials, missed the second spot by 4.56 points. She finished
third with 840.03 points.
</P>
<P>
   Davison, 20, achieved the goal of making the Olympics she first
had as a 6-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ''I remember watching Greg (Louganis) in 1988,'' said Davison,
whose lip quivered as tears rolled down her cheeks. ''I always
wanted to go, now I'm going.''
</P>
<P>
   Keim and Davison were 1-2 after the semifinals a day earlier and
they stayed that way throughout the five-dive final at King County
Aquatic Center.
</P>
<P>
   Diving with her sore right triceps taped, Keim never lost her
lead while saving her toughest dives -- both with a 3.0 difficulty
degree -- for her final two.
</P>
<P>
   Her marks for both were well off the 8.5s to 9.0s she earned for
her first three dives, but she had a big enough lead to hold off
Davison.
</P>
<P>
   Keim climbed out of the pool, checked the scoreboard, then
raised her arms in the air and smiled at the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Davison, who was fifth on springboard in the '96 trials,
pressured Keim and Rojohn by going for three dives that each had a
3.0 difficulty degree. Davison earned higher marks for those three
than Keim did for hers that were worth 3.0.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like doing the harder dives,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   None of the other 10 finalists, including Rojohn, had a dive
worth 3.0 on their list.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a little bit upset,'' said Rojohn, who turns 27 Thursday.
''I'm happy with the way I dove. A year ago I wasn't diving with
this consistency. I'm very happy with my performance. You can only
take care of yourself. The other dove better.''
</P>
<P>
   Sara Reiling of St. Paul, Minn., finished fourth with 792.60
points after moving up from seventh. Sunday Lewandowski of Mount
Lebanon, Pa., was fifth with 790.89.
</P>
<P>
   Dumais, denied an Olympic platform diving berth in 1996 by
Pichler, barely trailed his rival on springboard after the
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Pichler, who finished last in springboard qualifying four years
ago, led 12 divers advancing to Thursday night's finals with 682.86
points. Dumais was second with 681.66.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Ruiz of Orlando, Fla., the heavy favorite to qualify on
both springboard and platform, moved from seventh to fifth. He had
struggled in the morning preliminaries when he hit the board with
his toes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very pleased with my performance,'' Ruiz said. ''I know I
have a chance to make it. I feel very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Dumais was third behind Pichler and Kevin McMahon of Fremont,
Neb., going into his final dive. But he moved up with a pike inward
1&AMP;frac12; somersault that earned him marks ranging from 9.0 to 9.5 from
seven judges.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is going to be the best all-around competition we've had
in a long, long time. Everybody is stepping up and pushing each
other,'' said Dumais, whose brother, Justin, also made the finals.
''When I'm behind I push myself a little more. It's like I get more
of a rush, more adrenaline.''
</P>
<P>
   As a 16-year-old, Dumais finished 39 points behind Pichler in
the '96 trials. Only the top two finishers earn Olympic spots.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not comforting when someone gains 40 points on you,''
Pichler said of Dumais. ''I expected him to gain a lot of ground,
but not as much as he did.''
</P>
<P>
   McMahon, second going into the five-dive semifinal, dropped to
third on his last dive, a forward 1&AMP;frac12; somersault with a twist that
earned mostly 8.0s.
</P>
<P>
   That opened the door for Dumais to move up after coming into the
semifinals in fifth place. He earned two 10s on his second dive,
the same one that cost McMahon second place.
</P>
<P>
   McMahon had 673.32 points, while P.J. Bogart of Mesa, Ariz., was
fourth with 667.20 points and Ruiz totaled 663.72.
</P>
<P>
   Rio Ramirez of Miami, a Cuban defector awaiting permission from
his native country to compete for the United States if he qualifies
for the Sydney Games, was ninth, 55 points behind Pichler.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just thinking about my diving,'' Ramirez said. ''I just
want to do a good performance there and please myself, my coach and
the people who came to watch. I know what's going on, but I can't
think about it.''

<HEADLINE> US Complies on Korea Killing Probe  </HEADLINE>
By SANG-HUN CHOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korean investigators have
received an aerial photograph and transcripts of interviews with
more than 70 American veterans as part of a probe of an alleged
mass killing of refugees by GIs in the Korean War, U.S. and Korean
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors of the alleged attack at the hamlet of No Gun Ri
complained at a news conference in Seoul on Wednesday that the
Pentagon was not sharing information with their South Korean
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ''We suspect the Pentagon is trying to block a swift and
impartial investigation by not sharing data crucial to learning the
truth about No Gun Ri,'' the survivors said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   A senior South Korean military officer said in an interview
Wednesday the sides were working together. Washington and Seoul had
previously agreed to fully share data to ensure their separate
investigations are impartial.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no problem as far as information-sharing is
concerned,'' said Lt. Gen. Kim Jong-hwan, the chief No Gun Ri
investigator at Seoul's Defense Ministry. He said his investigators
had received two boxes of papers from the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon also recently sent South Korea an aerial photo of
No Gun Ri taken Aug. 6, 1950, some 11 days after the alleged
killings. Survivors claimed the photograph was doctored because it
showed no evidence of a strafing or bodies, but the Pentagon stood
by the authenticity of the photo.
</P>
<P>
   Korean officials said the Pentagon did not turn over one of the
declassified documents at all and that the second was not received
until its existence was disclosed in news reports, and Korean
investigators requested it.
</P>
<P>
   Kim said a document that states U.S. Air Force planes strafed
columns of civilian refugees was received only after Korean
investigators learned of its existence from a CBS-TV news report
June 5.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. Craig Quigley said later that the
Pentagon had held that document ''for a while'' before the CBS
broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   The second document was a captured North Korean report claiming
U.S. soldiers shot and killed South Korean refugees in
circumstances that match those at No Gun Ri in key details, the
South Korean officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The document, dated Aug. 2, 1950, and translated by the U.S.
Army within a few weeks of its capture, indicated the U.S. high
command knew about the killings near the town of Yongdong, eight
miles from No Gun Ri, almost immediately after the incident.
</P>
<P>
   The document was reported by The Associated Press and South
Korean news media last week. South Korean investigators said they
acquired that document independently.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Army spokesman Maj. Tom Collins denied the
survivors' accusation that the investigators were not sharing
information. He said both the North Korean captured document and
the document about aerial bombing had been sent to the Korean
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States and the Army have pledged to share
information with the Korean side, and we have done that,'' he said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our investigators are in daily contact with the ROK (Republic
of Korea) counterparts. To my knowledge, the ROK side is satisfied
with the amount of interaction going on between us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon opened an investigation last year after the AP
quoted U.S. veterans and South Korean survivors saying American GIs
carried out a mass killing of civilians July 26-28, 1950, at No Gun
Ri. Ex-GIs spoke of 100, 200 or simply hundreds dead. The South
Koreans say up to 400 were killed. The shootings were preceded by
an aerial strafing of a refugee column in which survivors and
ex-GIs estimate about 100 civilians died.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Kim Yong-kil told AP South Korean investigators had no
doubts that U.S. troops killed civilians at No Gun Ri. He said
South Korea has compiled the names of 180 people allegedly killed
there and believes as many as 500 refugees were in the area when
the initial air attack began.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon had originally planned to complete its
investigation by June 25 -- the anniversary of the war's outbreak.
But it now says the work won't be finished until this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors have accused the Pentagon of delaying the
investigation and want it completed by the end of July. In addition
to an undisclosed amount of financial restitution, victims want an
official apology and a monument to the dead.
</P>
<P>
   ''The victims have been demanding justice since the end of the
Korean War. Isn't it the time to give it to them?'' said Michael
Goss, a Philadelphia-based lawyer representing the survivors.

<HEADLINE> DiPietro Enters NHL Draft  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Rick DiPietro's agonizing decision to make himself
available for
the NHL draft should pay off on Saturday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 18-year-old goalie from Winthrop, Mass., is the top-ranked
North American goalie by NHL Central Scouting going into the draft
in Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   After days of deliberating, DiPietro decided to forego his
remaining years of college eligibility at Boston University to turn
pro. He was still wrestling with the decision at 3 p.m. EDT on May
1, and the paperwork had to be filed by 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was probably the most difficult decision I've ever had to
make as a person as well as a player,'' he said Wednesday from
Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a pretty intense time because we had so many different
opinions coming at us from people that we respected. There was so
many pros and cons to weigh that it got to the point where it was
really frustrating and a little too intense. I feel pretty
confident now that it was a good decision.''
</P>
<P>
   When DiPietro opted in, NHL Central Scouting made the
unprecedented move of revising its final rankings, putting a new
player No. 1. DiPietro was added to the list ahead of goalie Brent
Krahn, who had been ranked No. 1 all year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd have the odd change when a player opted in, but it
wouldn't have this significance,'' NHL director of scouting Frank
Bonello said. ''This guy could end up going top four or five.''
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-11, 185-pound Di Pietro was only the second American
to be named top goalie at the world junior hockey championship,
where the United States finished fourth, after he posted a 2-2-1
record, a 1.81 goals-against average and a .935 save percentage.
</P>
<P>
   In his rookie year at Boston University, DiPietro faced shooters
three to five years older, yet finished with an 18-5-5 record, a
2.45 goals-against average and .913 save percentage. He earned
rookie of the year honors in the Hockey East conference.
</P>
<P>
   After a season like that, the call of the pros was too much to
resist.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think what it really came down to was this is really my
opportunity to go after my goal of being an NHL goaltender,'' said
DiPietro. ''I just felt playing with the pros and getting used to
that pro game was something that was going to make me that much
better as a player and hopefully get me a year closer to the NHL.''
</P>
<P>
   DiPietro is quick, challenges shooters and has exceptional
puckhandling skills.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unusual to be saying this, but he sees the ice like a
defenseman,'' Bonello said. ''He'll pass the puck to his
forwards.''
</P>
<P>
   DiPietro grew up following the career of Philadelphia Flyers
goalie Ron Hextall.
</P>
<P>
   ''I picked up his stickhandling and tried to work on that in
practice,'' he said. ''I'm pretty confident going out of the net
and handling the puck and passing it up to my defense.
</P>
<P>
   College players who are 18 and opt into the draft lose their
college eligibility, but 19-year-old players, such as Wisconsin's
Dany Heatley, who is a projected top-five pick, can be drafted and
return to college.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, if DiPietro's birthday was four days earlier, on or
before Sept. 15, he would automatically go into the draft and be
eligible to return to college.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been telling my mother while I was making my decision 'If
it wasn't for you, if you would have had me four days earlier, I
wouldn't be in that position,''' DiPietro said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Islanders, who already have in their system Robert
Luongo, the highest-drafted goalie ever, have the top pick
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Thrashers are second, followed by the expansion
Minnesota Wild and Columbus Blue Jackets, the Tampa Bay Lightning,
the Nashville Predators, the Boston Bruins and Tampa again with the
eighth pick.
</P>
<P>
   Luongo was picked fourth overall by the Isles in 1997. Brian
Finley went sixth overall to Nashville last year and Jamie Storr
was the No. 7 pick by Los Angeles in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a strong year for goaltenders, said Bonello, with
DiPietro and Krahn considered the only two legitimate
first-rounders.
</P>
<P>
   Krahn, a 6-4, 200-pound native of Winkler, Manitoba, had a great
year and was especially impressive at the Canadian Hockey League's
Top Prospects Game in February, when he stopped 22 of 23 shots.

<HEADLINE> Webb Takes Aim on Another Major  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG FERGUSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Karrie Webb, the No. 1 player in women's
golf and the only one capable of winning a Grand Slam this year,
has set rather modest goals heading into the LPGA Tour's second
major.
</P>
<P>
   First, she wants to make the cut in the LPGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never been in contention at this tournament before,''
Webb said ''I've always had a good weekend, but never gotten off to
a good start on Thursday and Friday. I try not to put too much
pressure on myself, because I've never really played that well
here.''
</P>
<P>
   DuPont Country Club is an exception.
</P>
<P>
   Just about everywhere else Webb goes, she either wins or comes
awfully close. Already this year, the 25-year-old Australian has
won five times worldwide, finished second twice and has only been
out of the top 10 on one occasion.
</P>
<P>
   If those numbers sound familiar, they should. Tiger Woods has
won just as often and been close just as much.
</P>
<P>
   And while Woods won the U.S. Open by a record 15 strokes on
Sunday, keep in mind that Webb won the LPGA's first major -- the
Nabisco Championship -- by a record 10 strokes in March.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think what Karrie has done on our side of the tour is just
as good as what Tiger has done on their side of the tour, and I
don't think Karrie has gotten the respect or the notoriety that she
deserves,'' Juli Inkster said.
</P>
<P>
   The parallel in the careers of Woods and Webb is amazing. As a
rookie, Webb became the first woman to earn over $1 million. That
was overshadowed by Woods turning pro and winning twice to qualify
for the Tour Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, she shattered the LPGA scoring record and won six
times. Woods shattered the PGA scoring record and won eight times.
</P>
<P>
   Webb can't control the attention she gets, only her golf.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she has a chance to win the Grand Slam, which is
something not even Woods can accomplish this year.
</P>
<P>
   No one has ever won all four major championships in the same
season, and Webb is the only player on any tour who can still even
dream about it.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be great, and very important to me if I won this
week,'' Webb said. ''But it's only Wednesday, and I've got a long
road ahead of me before I even have a chance to hold that trophy on
Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb also won the du Maurier Classic in August, so a victory
this week would make her the first player since Pat Bradley in
1985-86 to win three straight majors. Ben Hogan in 1953 was the
last male to win three straight.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some have accepted that she's going to win a lot,'' Nancy
Lopez said. ''I don't think they sit back and say, 'Well, Karrie is
going to win this week.' But they know who they are going to have
to beat if they're going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb is the favorite this week because, like Woods, she is the
favorite every week. And just like on the PGA Tour, some of her
peers aren't ashamed to admit it.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I was a betting person, I would put my money on Karrie
every week. I'd be very rich right now,'' said Inkster, whose
victory last year in the LPGA Championship made her only the second
woman to complete the modern career Grand Slam.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of money, there's more at stake for Webb than the
$210,000 to this week's winner. Thanks to a bonus pool established
by Nabisco, she can earn an additional $250,000 by winning her
second major.
</P>
<P>
   That goes up to $1 million if she wins the U.S. Open next month,
and $2.5 million -- more than Webb won all of last year -- if she
wins all four.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the PGA Tour, at least Webb has some competition.
</P>
<P>
   Two-time U.S. Open champion Annika Sorenstam, who lost to Webb
in a playoff in Hawaii earlier this year, repaid the favor by
beating Webb with an eagle on the first playoff in the Evian
Masters last week in France.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Swede's third victory this year, a sign that she may
be ready to try to reclaim her No. 1 ranking.
</P>
<P>
   ''Karrie right now is the No. 1 player, and when you beat
somebody like that, it gives you more confidence,'' Sorenstam said.
''But also, it helps knowing your game is good enough to know that
you can beat her. That means a lot.''

<HEADLINE> France, Netherlands Face Tough Test  </HEADLINE>
By IAN PHILLIPS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROTTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Tournament favorites France and
the Netherlands can't afford the slightest complacency toward their
next opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch beat France 3-2 in Amsterdam on Wednesday. In many
ways, the result suited both sides: The Netherlands guaranteed that
its quarterfinal, against Yugoslavia, will be on home soil, while
France's meeting with Spain will be near its Belgian training camp
in Bruges.
</P>
<P>
   But on the evidence of Wednesday's other matches, neither side
is relishing its next opponent.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the greatest European Championship matches ever, Spain
beat Yugoslavia 4-3 with two injury-time goals -- a result that
advanced both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Spain, trailing 3-2, looked down and out after 90 minutes in
Bruges.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslavs went ahead after 31 minutes on Savo Milosevic's
fourth goal of the championship. Alfonso Peres tied it for Spain
six minutes before halftime before substitute Dejan Govedarica
regained the lead for the Yugoslavs in the 51st, four minutes after
entering the game.
</P>
<P>
   Almost from the restart, another replacement, Pedro Munitis,
made it 2-2 before Yugoslav defender Slavisa Jokanovic was ejected
in the 63rd. Slobodan Komljenovic made it 3-2 in the 75th minute.
Spain then incredibly turned the game, Gaizka Mendieta scoring on a
penalty shot and Alfonso firing in the winner in the 97th minute.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the most important match I have ever played,'' said
Spanish midfielder Josep Guardiola. ''This shows that in football
the difference between heaven and hell is in one minute.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a game to treasure,'' Alfonso said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslavs were understandably bitter.
</P>
<P>
   ''The referee was the best Spanish player on the pitch,''
Slavisa Jokanovic said. ''I feel that if the Spaniards hadn't
scored in injury time, he would have scored one for them.''
</P>
<P>
   At the final whistle, the Yugoslavs thought they'd been knocked
out. But Norway only managed a 0-0 draw with Slovenia, knocking
both teams out of the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was extremely disappointing,'' said Norwegian coach Nils
Johan Semb, who admitted that his team had played for the draw in
the last 20 minutes, never expecting Spain to score the two goals
needed to win. ''We're out, that's life. I saw a Spanish journalist
celebrate and I knew it was over.''
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's other final group match game, the Czech Republic
beat Denmark 2-0. Both sides were already out of the competition.
</P>
<P>
   In Amsterdam, France fielded a second-string side, and the
Netherlands also made changes.
</P>
<P>
   The French twice took the lead on goals by Christophe Dugarry
and David Trezeguet, but the Dutch hit back with Patrick Kluivert,
Frank de Boer and Boudewijn Zenden, three of their Barcelona stars.
</P>
<P>
   Dutch coach Frank Rijkaard was happy his team showed the grit to
come back from a 2-1 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ''They continued to believe in a good outcome. They managed the
tension well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   French coach Roger Lemerre said it had been a useful exercise to
field some of his reserve players -- defender Marcel Desailly was
the only regular who played.
</P>
<P>
   ''Though I am not pleased with the result, I am satisfied that
players that have not played until now showed their value,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the other weekend quarterfinals, it's Romania vs. Italy and
Portugal vs. Turkey. Thursday and Friday are rest days.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Germany flew home and will soon have a new coach
after Erich Ribbeck, under fire over team selection and poor
performances, announced he was quitting. Germany lost its last
match 3-0 to a second-string Portuguese side. It also lost to
England for the first time in 34 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I failed to turn Germany's best players into a competitive
team,'' he said. ''We were humiliated in the last game,'' Ribbeck
said. ''This defeat hurts, but what hurts more is that we went out
with a such a performance.''

<HEADLINE> Murder Rate Up in U.S. Cities  </HEADLINE>
By BRETT MARTEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- A week after Mayor Marc Morial received a
national award for overhauling the city police department and a
coinciding drop in crime, two teen-agers were murdered after
leaving a weekend party in an upscale neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Four more people have been killed since then, the latest victims
in a disturbing trend: There have been 110 murders in New Orleans
this year, compared with 80 by the same time a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news isn't limited to New Orleans. Selected checks of
major cities, including Baltimore, Boston, Dallas, Los Angeles, New
York and Philadelphia, found that murders are up over last year.
</P>
<P>
   The increases follow a substantial drop in murder rates across
the country during most of the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the FBI said murder and other serious crimes reported to
the police dropped for an eighth consecutive year in 1999, by far
the longest-running crime decline on record. Murder was down 2
percent in cities over 500,000 and 8 percent overall.
</P>
<P>
   Several leading criminal justice experts agreed that the public
should no longer expect to see the same significant drops in the
rate of violent crimes that occurred in the 1990s. But they were
unsure whether this year's murder upswing is temporary or whether
America's violent crime rate has reached its low point and will now
increase.
</P>
<P>
   ''I call it the criminal justice limbo stick; at some point you
can't go any lower,'' said James Alan Fox, a criminal justice
professor at Northeastern University in Boston. ''Certain types of
murder are way down ... but the issue of thrill and revenge
motivation is still here and remains as American as apple pie and
we have not seen an abatement of this type of violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Levitt, a University of Chicago economics professor who
specializes in criminal justice issues, actually expects a
long-term drop in violent crime. He said unabated prison growth has
removed violent offenders from society and is serving as a
deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the news so far this year is bad. The murder rate for
the first half of the year has dropped in some large cities, Denver
and Phoenix among them, by as much as 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But other experts aren't as optimistic as Levitt.
</P>
<P>
   ''Demography is working against us,'' said Fox, noting the
number of people between 14 and 20 -- considered crime-prone ages --
is growing. ''If we don't pay attention, we could see youth
violence so bad we'll look back on the 1990s and say, 'Those were
the good old days.'''
</P>
<P>
   When Morial took office in 1994, New Orleans had the nation's
worst murder rate. That has fallen more than 50 percent since then,
with 162 murders last year. At the U.S. Conference of Mayors in
Seattle on June 10, Morial received the City Livability Award for
turning things around.
</P>
<P>
   But now New Orleans is on pace for 230 murders this year, the
total in 1998. Police Superintendent Richard Pennington has blamed
most of the killing on drug gangs.
</P>
<P>
   The real question may be why the city's 1999 rate was so low,
according to Al Blumstein, a criminal justice professor at Carnegie
Mellon University in Pittsburgh. He said last year's tally was an
anomaly.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Fox, Blumstein sees less of a threat posed by the growing
population of young people. The crime rate for that age group has
been falling at about 5 percent, he said, and he expects violent
crime rates to level off.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've solved the easy stuff, now it's going to be a lot harder
to go beyond that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   None of the experts found evidence that the increase in some
city murder rates is due to an economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Reynolds, a Texas A&AMP;M economics professor and director of
criminal justice at the National Center for Policy Analysis in
Dallas, instead suggested that recent public embarrassments for
police in Los Angeles and New York has left officers more gun shy
about the way they treat suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ''We may be seeing something here in terms of temporary drop in
police efficiency because of either morale, corruption or
scandal,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 11, Padres 8  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Travis Lee was 3-for-4 with three RBIs Wednesday
night as the Arizona Diamondbacks' slumbering offense awoke for an
11-8 victory over the San Diego Padres.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona took two of three from the Padres and has a day off
before beginning a big weekend series against the Colorado Rockies,
who trail the Diamondbacks by a half-game in the NL West.
</P>
<P>
   With two of their best hitters, Jay Bell and Matt Williams,
sitting out the game, the Diamondbacks pounded 14 hits against five
San Diego pitchers. The Padres also walked nine, including leadoff
batters in five consecutive innings. The 11 runs were the most for
Arizona since May 9. San Diego also committed four errors.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Womack tripled in his first two times up for the
Diamondbacks to tie his own club record. Womack was 3-for-6 with an
RBI and was robbed of a bases-loaded hit by Al Martin's diving
catch in left field to end the sixth inning. Damian Miller hit his
sixth homer and an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Morgan (2-1) got the victory with three shutout innings in
relief of Omar Daal, who had another shaky outing, but a two-run
single in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Reyes (1-3) allowed three runs on three hits in one
inning of relief to take the loss.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Owens was 2-for-3 with three runs scored for the Padres,
including a two-run home run, his fourth homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego starter Brian Meadows allowed six runs -- five earned --
on six hits before being relieved with the bases loaded and none
out in the third. Reliever Brandon Kolb got Hanley Frias to ground
into a first-to-home-to-first double play. But Daal lofted Kolb's
0-2 pitch over the third baseman's head for a single that drove in
two runs and made it 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego tied it with two runs in the fourth and two in the
fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Daal walked Ed Sprague to lead off the fifth, then gave up Phil
Nevin's RBI double before being relieved by Morgan. Bret Boone
singled to drive in Nevin and tie it.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks took the lead for good, 7-6, on Womack's RBI
single in the fifth. Arizona added three more in the sixth on RBI
singles by Lee and Miller. The third run scored when Danny Bautista
beat out what would have been an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   In San Diego's sixth, Martin hit one to deep left field, where
Luis Gonzalez went up to try to catch it at the wall. But a fan in
a Padres jersey reached over and appeared to touch the ball and
Gonzalez's glove, and the ball bounced free for a triple.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez and manager Buck Showalter argued vehemently with
umpire Dana Demuth that it should have been a ground-rule double,
but to no avail. The fan was thrown out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Klesko hit his 14th homer, a two-run shot off Byung-Hyun
Kim in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Daal gave up six runs, four earned, on four hits in four-plus
innings. He walked three, hit two batters and struck out two. Daal
has allowed 18 runs in his last 8 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
@Notes: Arizona's Bernard Gilkey ended an 0-for-28 slump with a
seventh-inning pinch-hit single. ... Tony Gwynn sat out his second
consecutive game. If Gwynn retires this year, he's played his last
game at Bank One Ballpark because San Diego doesn't play Arizona
again this season. ... Padres right-hander Stan Spencer, who left
Monday's game after five shutout innings, is out 4-6 weeks with a
right elbow flexor strain. ... First baseman Erubiel Durazo, out
since May 30 with torn cartilage in his right wrist, had no ill
effects in rehabilitation appearances with Triple-A Tucson, and is
expected to be activated by the Diamondbacks on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Circuit on a silicon chip mimics wiring of the brain  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW FORDAHL
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists have developed an electronic circuit that mimics the
wiring of the human brain in some ways - an achievement that could
revolutionize computer science and improve understanding of how
nature's most powerful processor works.
</P>
<P>
   The circuit, built on a silicon chip the size of a fingernail,
is far from the thinking machines of science fiction. For one
thing, it cannot learn the way the brain can.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers say it could result in better speech and object
recognition by computers.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a demonstration of what's possible when circuits
compute in biological ways,'' said Rahul Sarpeshkar, a computer
science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who
worked on the project. ''We're still far away from building a
brain.''
</P>
<P>
   The findings were published in Thursday's issue of the journal
Nature.
</P>
<P>
   The project is the culmination of more than two decades of work
using transistors and silicon to mimic the natural circuitry in the
brain. It is the first time a circuit inspired by the brain's
cortex has been created in hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional circuits work in one of two ways: They are either
digital and specific such as computer processors, or analog and
nonspecific like radio amplifiers. Research suggests the brain is
able to do digital and analog computing at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Someone watching a highway, for instance, can sort distinct
objects like a police cruiser and perceive changes in direction,
speed and color. Traditional digital circuits in computers aren't
nearly as efficient as the brain in perceptual tasks.
</P>
<P>
   The latest research, done at Lucent Technologies' Bell Labs in
New Jersey, combines both digital and analog processing by using
artificial neurons that either excite or inhibit each other based
on responses, or feedback, from other neurons.
</P>
<P>
   ''In one simultaneous circuit, both digital selection and analog
amplification can co-exist,'' Sarpeshkar said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers applied simultaneous electrical currents to two
artificial neurons in their circuit. It selected the stronger of
the stimuli and suppressed its response to the weaker. That is not
unlike, say, a frog choosing which of two flies to eat, the
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   And the circuit, like a brain, maintained its selection as the
weaker current was increased and the stronger decreased.
</P>
<P>
   Another unique aspect of the circuit is no single element made
the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you take a Pentium chip and cut a single wire, then it
would probably stop functioning,'' said Richard Hahnloser, another
MIT researcher. ''If you took our circuit, you could cut a wire and
it would still work the same.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be at least 50 years before artificial neural circuitry
approaches the abilities of the brain and its 240 billion neurons,
Sarpeshkar said.
</P>
<P>
   But even simple circuits are useful in demonstrating how
biological networks operate, said Dean Buonomano, a neurobiology
professor at the University of California at Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE> Gores, Venturas Bond in Minn.  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- The Gores and the Venturas raised some
eyebrows with quality bonding time, munching popcorn, giggling and
cheering as Ventura's daughter put her horse through its paces in a
cavernous arena.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've hit it off,'' said Gore spokesman Chris Lehane.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, generally accused of being wooden and
stiff, and Minnesota's flamboyant Gov. Jesse Ventura, never accused
of either, are spending more than a day together in a pairing that
includes wives Tipper and Terry.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're good friends, it's not complicated,'' said Gore, the
Democratic presidential contender.
</P>
<P>
   It is, of course, very complicated.
</P>
<P>
   The four hooked up Wednesday at the governor's mansion and then
headed to a very large -- and mostly empty -- arena where about 100
people watched a group of riders put their sleekly groomed horses
through their paces.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters were kept across the hall, but the couples were
clearly having a ball. They chatted constantly with animated
gestures. Gore wore his trademark cowboy boots, while Ventura
donned a baseball cap. There was no thought given to ties.
</P>
<P>
   Their big moment came when the Venturas' daughter, 16-year-old
Jade Janos, trotted into the arena on her horse -- Jardiniere --
wearing a very formal long gold coat and brown tights, sitting
stiffly in the saddle with a bowler hat on her head.
</P>
<P>
   Her name, by the way, is Janos because Ventura's real name is
James Janos, changed during his professional wrestling career. She
was the focus for the evening, but most were paying attention to
the growing relationship between Gore and Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   The pairing is raising some eyebrows. Ventura was elected as a
Reform Party candidate, and was that party's top elected official
until he quit and became an independent.
</P>
<P>
   He's demonstrated some appeal with independent voters, and some
argued that an association with Ventura's offbeat image could make
Gore seem less stiff. Aides said it was simply a case of chemistry
-- and some shared issues.
</P>
<P>
   He and Gore met earlier this year for breakfast, followed by a
dinner and gathering where the wives hit it off as well, Lehane
said. The Gores were staying the governor's mansion and spending
some quality time together in private before a public session
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The wives went for a private ride of their own earlier
Wednesday, and all four shared an intimate dinner at the mansion.
</P>
<P>
   The meal opened with cranberry apple breaded walleye, followed
by rack of lamb and finished off with sour cream cheesecake. Green
beans and mushrooms, along with a potato dish, accompanied the main
course in a very Midwestern meal.
</P>
<P>
   The formal horse show was the highlight of Wednesday's events,
but there was a very real purpose behind the event.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura spokesman David Ruth said daughter Jade was born with
epileptic seizures, which caused neurological damage. She has a
learning disability and is in a special education program.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents are big equestrians, owning the Jesters' Falling
Tree Ranch, and Ruth said Jade is an enthusiastic rider. ''It's
something she excels at and it's helpful to her,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Ventura head to a junior high school in suburban
Minnetonka on Thursday for a daylong event focusing on special
education needs.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's association with Ventura has not been lost on local
Democrats as Gore continued his focus on Midwestern battleground
states. On his way to a meeting with Ventura, Gore stopped to chat
with picketers on strike against a hotel and huddled privately with
Democratic activists at a St. Paul restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd gathered outside the restaurant, including about a dozen
people carrying signs backing Republican presidential rival Texas
Gov. George W. Bush and one saying ''Gore-Ventura 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Borovansky waited outside with some advice for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's see some personality, it's been boring so far,''
Borovansky said he would tell Gore.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore actually shook his hand, the tune had changed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just be yourself and you'll be great,'' he told Gore.

<HEADLINE> Study Examines Sonar Effects  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW FORDAHL
<TEXT>
<P>
   A powerful new sonar being tested by the Navy affects the length
of humpback whale songs but doesn't seem to lead to any other
extreme behaviors, according to a new study.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists reported Thursday the low-frequency, high-range sonar
used to detect submarines extended the mating songs of some
humpbacks while others stopped singing altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ''We looked for any sorts of extreme responses like breaching,
where the animal would jump out of the water and swim rapidly away
from the sonar,'' said Patrick Miller, the study's lead author and
a researcher at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. ''We
didn't observe any sorts of extreme reactions.''
</P>
<P>
   The new sonar has come under greater scrutiny after a biologist
hired by the National Marine Fisheries Service suggested a possible
link between Navy traditional sonar tests and ear hemorrhages that
fatally disoriented the animals.
</P>
<P>
   In March, at least 16 whales of four different species beached
themselves in the Bahamas. Seven died, and initial autopsies
suggested the deaths might have been linked to the Navy tests.
</P>
<P>
   The latest research took place off Hawaii in 1998. Miller and
his colleagues first recorded the whale songs without the sonar and
later asked the Navy to transmit the signals.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 16 whales monitored, five stopped singing altogether. The
remainder sang on average 29 percent longer when the sonar was
activated than without it. The findings appear in Thursday's issue
of the journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   The research, sponsored by the Navy but conducted by independent
scientists, said it wasn't clear how much of a threat the sonar and
its effects on mating songs pose to whales.
</P>
<P>
   The whales might just be compensating for the noise, Miller
said. Still, he added, the Navy should avoid active breeding areas
when using the new sonar.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to take a commonsense approach to reducing how much
animals are exposed to sound -- not only Navy sonar but all the
sounds in the ocean like shipping traffic, whale watching traffic,
construction and underwater explosions,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Humpback whales are known for their acrobatics and the
underwater songs males use to attract mates. The endangered species
received full protection from commercial whaling in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Animal-rights activists, some of whom had tried to stop the
latest research by swimming near the test site, said the Nature
study authors didn't do enough follow-up on the animals after the
tests.
</P>
<P>
   ''They didn't look at results on fish or anything else,''
Benjamin White, of the Animal Welfare Institute, said Wednesday.
''The whole study was based on the assumption that the effects
would be immediate and obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller's research and other projects sponsored by the Navy will
be used in an environmental impact statement of the new sonar
expected to be released later this year, said Lt. Bill Speaks, a
Navy spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Albright Urges China in Taiwan Talks  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is urging
Chinese leaders to reopen talks with Taiwan and to curb exports of
missile technology.
</P>
<P>
   Albright also hopes to learn more about North Korea's overtures
to South Korea and its mysterious leader Kim Jung Il.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's hastily arranged visit is a chance to accelerate a
lowering of tensions in the region, but top aides stressed the
Clinton administration would not relent in its exploration of a
shield against North Korean missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the United States is set to announce negotiations to
stop the development and export of North Korean missile technology,
the program has progressed to the point it poses a threat, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   If the talks succeed, shipments to Iran, Pakistan and possibly
other nations could end, Similarly, Albright is pressing for curbs
on Chinese exports, a long-sought U.S. plea.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations, due to be announced shortly, follow a decision
by North Korea to extend a moratorium on missile flight tests.
</P>
<P>
   Also due soon is an announcement of a visit by a high-level
North Korean official to Washington, as well as talks to reaffirm
North Korea's pledge to halt a nuclear weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Clinton administration lifted a 50-year embargo
on trade with North Korea, permitting American companies and
individuals to trade with and transfer money to North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea responded Wednesday, extending the moratorium on
missile tests it first announced as a suspension nine months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will have a positive effect on Washington high-level
talks,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a State Department spokesman, Philip Reeker,
said, ''We welcome the North Korean statement and the continued
restraint by Pyongyang.''
</P>
<P>
   While the two sides also will hold a new round of talks on
terrorism, North Korea remains on the State Department's list of
sponsors of terrorism. Under U.S. law, that prohibits most U.S. aid
and requires Washington to oppose World Bank loans to North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Albright arrived at dawn Thursday in Beijing
for talks with Chinese leaders. She began her visit by seeing
Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan for a luncheon meeting.
</P>
<P>
   After shaking hands with Tang at the Diaoyutai State Guest
House, Albright said she had ''lots of things to discuss,'' but did
not raise specifics.
</P>
<P>
   Meetings were scheduled later in the day with Vice Premier Qian
Qichen and Premier Zhu Rongji. Albright was due to meet Chinese
President Jiang Zemin Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, she files to Seoul, South Korea, for an update on the
first meeting of the heads of North and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The summit last week in Pyongyang produced an agreement between
South Korea's Kim Dae-jung and North Korea's Kim Jong Il to work
for peace and unity on their bitterly divided peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   The North Korean leader held talks in Beijing before the summit.
Albright intends to press the Chinese, who helped set up the
summit, for more information about him, his economic policy and
whether he is committed to peace on the Korean peninsula, a senior
U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
   The moves toward reconciliation between the two Koreas raised
questions bout the continued presence of some 37,000 U.S. troops in
South Korea as a barrier to invasion from the north. Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
has called on the Clinton administration to begin considering a
pullout.
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials and other key members of Congress
said the threat remains and so should the troops, which cost the
United States an estimated $3.2 billion a year to maintain.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting China for the first time since March 1999, Albright was
given access to a wide range of top officials, including President
Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, inspired by the Korean summit talks, President Chen
Shui-bian renewed an appeal to China to join him at a summit to
resolve a half-century of disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Chen also offered to meet at lower levels, but refused to submit
to a Chinese precondition that he declare there is only one China,
which would reinforce Beijing's view of Taiwan as a rebellious
province that must be absorbed by the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly, he has gone out of his way to try and lower tensions
to indicate that he is a person they can deal with,'' said a senior
U.S. official, speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity.
''We have to emphasize that point.''

<HEADLINE> Committee OKs GOP Medicare Plan  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican legislation to offer prescription
drug insurance under Medicare is headed for the House floor after a
contentious committee session that underscored the political stakes
involved less than five months before elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm happy to have you on the record,'' Rep. Pete Stark,
D-Calif., said to Republicans shortly before they advanced the bill
on a party-line vote late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a political exercise on your part,'' he added, and vowed
to pay for a campaign advertisement in the district of a committee
Republican this fall ''saying he doesn't care about seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican whom Stark mentioned, Rep. Clay Shaw of Florida,
sat quietly a few feet away on the committee dais in the Ways and
Means Committee room. ''I guess he hasn't been on the positive side
of a vote in six years,'' Shaw said afterward. ''I guess it's
getting to him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican bill would rely on private insurance companies,
aided by government subsidies, to offer prescription drug coverage
to seniors nationwide. It carries a price tag of $40 billion over
five years.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want the government to control health care,'' Rep.
Jim McCrery, R-La., said in response to one of numerous Democratic
objections to the GOP proposal. ''They haven't done a particularly
good job. We want to try the private marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican bill includes subsidies for low-income senior
citizens that would reduce or eliminate monthly premiums and
deductibles. Co-payments also would be reduced for the less
well-off, although never eliminated entirely.
</P>
<P>
   There are additional subsidies to cover catastrophic costs for
all seniors who purchase insurance, regardless of their financial
well-being.
</P>
<P>
   The measure is penciled in for a floor vote next week, an
ambitious schedule given the complexity of the issue and the
political jockeying under way. A tough fight is expected, with
Democrats laboring to hold down defections in hopes of denying
Republicans a bipartisan victory they can trumpet in their
campaigns this fall.
</P>
<P>
   At the last minute Wednesday night, Democrats sweetened their
own competing bill with $21 billion in new spending for hospitals,
home health providers, medical schools and others in the regular
Medicare program. The money has no direct bearing on drug
insurance, but could well give some wavering Democrats a reason to
oppose the GOP bill.
</P>
<P>
   On prescription drugs, Democrats backed an alternative for a
uniform government-defined Medicare prescription drug benefit. They
said repeatedly that Republicans couldn't guarantee their
legislation would live up to its claim of offering all senior
citizens a choice of two plans.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no guarantee of any particular benefit,'' said Rep.
Ben Cardin, D-Md. ''Let's at least guarantee to our citizens
there's a benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardin's proposal to authorize the federal government to offer
an insurance plan of its own in competition with private companies
was rejected -- as were all Democratic attempts to make fundamental
changes in the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Final passage came on a party-line vote of 23-14. The outcome
was the reverse on the Democratic alternative.
</P>
<P>
   The current effort to provide prescription drug insurance
results from a combination of economic and political factors.
</P>
<P>
   The economic expansion has caused budget surpluses to swell
beyond expectations, freeing funds for new programs. And in
political terms, pollster Glen Bolger advised the GOP last week in
a closed-door meeting that passage of a prescription drug bill was
a ''political imperative.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans sought to blunt one Democratic charge in the
committee deliberations -- that private insurance companies would
not offer policies for sale. Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., the chief
architect of the bill, circulated a letter from a top official at
Merck-Medco, a provider of pharmaceutical benefits to health plans.
''We would work to develop a prescription drug-only plan ...
nationwide in competition with others in what we expect will be a
highly competitive market,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Deductibles, co-payments and other out of pocket charges would
vary under the GOP bill. Under a draft standard policy, officials
estimated monthly premiums of up to $40 and a $250 annual
deductible. Policyholders would pay half the cost of each
prescription, until they reach a $1,050 annual benefit limit.
Coverage would then stop, but any costs over $6,000 would be
covered in full.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the Democratic alternative envisions a monthly
premium starting at $26, no deductibles, a 50 percent co-payment
for each prescription and an annual benefit limit of $1,000.
Democrats also would provide financial assistance to those with low
incomes. Their plan for catastrophic insurance provides greater
coverage than the Republican bill, but the overall price tag is
much higher, roughly $100 billion.

<HEADLINE> Democrats See $1T Hike in Surplus  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Both parties' presidential hopefuls are racing
to take advantage of President Clinton's pending announcement that
the federal surplus for the next decade looks a colossal $1
trillion larger than it did in February.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is planning to unveil his new surplus projections as
early as Monday, according to congressional Democrats, lobbyists
and others who spoke on condition of anonymity. He also will
propose using the budget bonanza for faster debt reduction,
enhanced Medicare benefits and deeper tax cuts, they say.
</P>
<P>
   The new forecast is expected to bring projected surpluses for
the decade ending in 2010 to $1.9 trillion, excluding Social
Security. That would more than double the $746 billion the White
House predicted in February, a deluge of cash fueled by the
formidable economy.
</P>
<P>
   A deep, long-lasting recession could make the projected
surpluses shrink or vanish.
</P>
<P>
   But Treasury Department figures have shown unexpected mountains
of federal revenue in recent months, leaving only the precise size
of the updated surplus estimates unknown. Both major presidential
campaigns have already begun trying to use the new figures to their
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the presumed Democratic candidate, has
used the numbers to justify a torrent of recent spending and tax
proposals. These have included a 10-year, $500 billion tax-cut
package for child care, education and other purposes; voluntary,
tax-free retirement accounts financed partly by federal payments;
and new spending for the environment, health and schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''The surplus is a result and a symbol of our prosperity,'' said
Gore spokesman Douglas Hattaway.
</P>
<P>
   The comment underlined the Gore campaign's hopes of taking
credit for the government's unprecedented fiscal health.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Texas Gov. George W. Bush have tried using the figures
to rebut Democratic arguments that the likely Republican nominee's
budget plans are irresponsible. Bush has proposed a $1.3 trillion,
10-year tax cut. He also would allow Social Security recipients to
invest part of their payroll taxes that support the program in the
stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said the Texan would use extra
surpluses for debt reduction and strengthening Social Security --
both of which are highly popular with the public.
</P>
<P>
   The extra money ''won't be used for more spending or tax cuts,''
Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials have refused to discuss the forthcoming
announcement. But others said one focus would be Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   They said Clinton would go beyond his announcement Tuesday that
he would use some of the surplus -- $40 billion over 10 years -- to
boost Medicare reimbursements to hospitals and other health care
providers. Those payments are aimed at restoring cuts made as part
of the 1997 budget-balancing deal that lawmakers now say went
deeper than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said Clinton also will propose making his prescription
drug plan for Medicare recipients more generous.
</P>
<P>
   They said they expect him to propose starting the part of the
plan aimed at helping people with catastrophic illnesses earlier
than expected. They said he might propose starting it in 2003, when
his overall prescription plan would begin, instead of 2006, which
he proposed in his 2001 budget in February.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's prescription drug plan would cost $149 billion over 10
years, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated. Clinton said
the catastrophic portion of it would cost $35 billion from 2006
through 2010, but he provided no details of how it would work.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also will endorse fencing off Medicare's projected
surpluses from use for spending or tax cuts. That idea is also
supported by Gore, and the House voted 420-2 Tuesday to do the same
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers routinely have spent Medicare surpluses for other
purposes for decades. But now, surpluses have grown so large that
politicians have found there is enough money for spending and tax
cuts without using the Medicare funds.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also will propose using a large portion of the new
surplus to accelerate elimination of the $3.5 trillion publicly
held portion of the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   His budget envisioned eliminating that debt by 2013. The new
numbers will move up that date, perhaps to sometime within the next
decade, Democrats said.
</P>
<P>
   The overall national debt is $5.7 trillion. The remaining $2.2
trillion is money the government owes its own trust funds, like
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also will propose extra spending for education and other
domestic programs, Democrats said, but not for fiscal 2001, the
year for which Congress is now writing spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said Clinton will also make his tax-cut proposal
bigger.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that, he is expected to eliminate some of the tax
increases he proposed in February to help pay for his budget
initiatives. Most of those proposed tax increases had virtually no
chance of being approved by Congress anyway, and dropping them will
let him boast a bigger net tax-cut figure.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Clinton proposed $351 billion in tax cuts over 10
years, as calculated by the Congressional Budget Office. It was
partly paid for with $205 billion in tax increases he proposed.

<HEADLINE> Gas Prices, Security Vex Richardson  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- For Bill Richardson, his two worst nightmares
have come true: $2 gasoline and another security scandal at a
nuclear weapons lab.
</P>
<P>
   In a span of 10 days, President Clinton's affable and ambitious
energy secretary has gone from someone viewed as a Mr. Fix It -- and
possible Democratic vice presidential candidate -- to being the
target of unusually angry congressional attacks.
</P>
<P>
   And Richardson is getting singed by Republicans and Democrats
alike.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've lost all credibility,'' Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala.,
chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told Richardson on
Wednesday as he appeared to answer questions about the latest
security breakdown at the Los Alamos nuclear weapons lab.
</P>
<P>
   While Richardson sought to convince senators that he had worked
feverishly over the past year to fix security shortcomings in his
department, Shelby shot back that it was Richardson who was part of
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''Look in the mirror,'' the senator fumed.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost expected from Shelby, a conservative who had made
clear he believes Richardson should resign. But a broadside from
Sen. Robert Byrd, the West Virginia Democrat with 48 years in the
Senate, stunned the hearing room.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have shown an extreme contempt ... of this Congress,''
Byrd lectured Richardson, who had spent 14 years as a congressman
from New Mexico before becoming ambassador to the United Nations
and two years ago energy secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd told Richardson he had made numerous assurances, but had
not followed through. Another rub: Richardson didn't show up for a
hearing on the Los Alamos problem last week, angering senators.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've had a bright and brilliant career. But you will never
again receive the support of the Senate of the United States for
any office to which you might be appointed. It's gone. You've
squandered your treasure,'' Byrd said.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by three of his top assistants, Richardson sat quietly,
taken aback by the intensely personal tone of Byrd's words.
Although at times combative, Richardson was mostly subdued, knowing
that for all purposes he was in the dock and nothing he might say
would help.
</P>
<P>
   ''In two years I've done more on security than has been done in
the last 20 years,'' he told the senators. But they were in no mood
for such explanations.
</P>
<P>
   It was in stark contrast to a year ago when Richardson trekked
regularly to Capitol Hill to try to explain another security flap,
one also involving nuclear secrets at Los Alamos and one of its
scientists, Wen Ho Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, one senator after another praised the fledgling
energy secretary for trying to get to the bottom of the mess and
noted it was not his doing. He was one of their own. It was
Richardson's credentials as a lawmaker and his reputation as an
unorthodox diplomatic troubleshooter that helped ease his task of
convincing Congress that the nuclear security mess would be taken
care of.
</P>
<P>
   But now it has happened again. ''Your assertion that you've been
attempting to address this problem rings hollow,'' said Sen.
Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, summing up the views of many.
</P>
<P>
   It is not only the Los Alamos problem that has made this a
summer of dread for Richardson, but also soaring gasoline prices.
An astute politician, Richardson was quick this week to declare
that he would spend all his time focusing on two issues: Los Alamos
and bringing down the price of gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   But on neither is he likely to have much control over what
happens in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The two issues in tandem may already have sunk any chance that
Richardson, the administration's top-ranking Hispanic, has of
becoming Al Gore's vice presidential running mate, something
Richardson privately is known to covet. His name on the ticket
surely would make campaign issues out of gasoline prices -- should
they remain high -- and nuclear weapons security.
</P>
<P>
   Gregarious and smart, Richardson, 52, has over the years shown a
knack for meeting tough situations head-on. ''I will keep tackling
the tough problems,'' he said following Wednesday's hearing. That's
why as a congressman he made a name for himself, traveling to
countries like Sudan, North Korea and Iraq and through his own
style of diplomacy managing to rescue Americans held there.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's very used to walking into a room and having everybody
with their swords drawn,'' a longtime friend, Earl Potter, said not
long ago. But that was before the latest Los Alamos security
scandal and the gasoline price spike.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday in the Senate, the swords were especially sharp.
</P>
<P>
   After listening to Byrd, Richardson said, ''I hope to earn
Senator Byrd's trust again, maybe not,'' and then mused over his
own career.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was in Congress for 14 years,'' he said. ''I am a man of the
people, and that's the Congress. And, in fact, after I look at my
career, being a congressman was the best job I ever had.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Not far from the display case of the revered
500-year-old Gutenberg Bible, the Library of Congress is opening a
show Thursday devoted to one of the oldest surviving American comic
strips -- Chic Young's ''Blondie.''
</P>
<P>
   Blondie Boopadoop, the dizzy flapper of the 1930s, remains as
slim and pretty as ever 70 years later, though she's been the
mother of two teen-agers for decades and now is the proprietor of a
prosperous catering business.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit, called ''Blondie Gets Married!'' features one of
Young's earlier and favorite strips. It shows bridegroom Dagwood
Bumstead dragging her off to Niagara Falls.
</P>
<P>
   ''You'll help me with the dishes, won't you darling?'' she asks
demurely.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yeh, but we'll worry about the dishes after we get back from
our honeymoon,'' replies the panting Dagwood.
</P>
<P>
   That's about as daring as the strip gets. Its innocent-looking
teens, Alexander -- ex-Baby Dumpling -- and Cookie, rarely get into
any trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Dagwood, originally a playboy disinherited by his millionaire
father, has evolved into a wimpish office worker who can never get
a raise from his cantankerous boss, Mr. Dithers. This week he was
slam-dunking bits of paper into a wastebasket while his colleagues
were closing big contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Murat Bernard ''Chic'' Young died in 1973 after drawing Blondie
seven days a week for 43 years, producing more than 15,000 strips.
His daughter Jeanne Young O'Neil, has given 150 originals to the
library.
</P>
<P>
   ''My father would emerge from his studio each afternoon with the
penciled proofstrips in hand and run them by my mother Athel
Lindorf ... to get her expert opinion and, if necessary, spelling
corrections,'' she wrote in a brochure to go with the show.
</P>
<P>
   Of the library's collection, 27 will be displayed in its ground
floor Swann Gallery, devoted to cartoon and illustration. The show
also includes Paul Revere's depiction of the Boston Massacre of
1770 -- a piece of propaganda that helped bring on the American
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Sara W. Duke, a curator of the show, said the strip -- now
continued by the originator's son, Dean Young -- appears in 2,000
newspapers in 55 countries and 35 languages.
</P>
<P>
   ''International readers were often surprised when they found out
that the comic strip did not originate in their own country,'' she
wrote -- perhaps an indication of how the American middle-class way
of life has become familiar to the world.
</P>
<P>
   The towering ''Dagwood sandwich'' of apparently incompatible
foods has found its way into at least one dictionary. And Blondie
appeared on a U.S. postage stamp in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''Blondie Gets Married!'' will be in the Thomas Jefferson
Building of the Library of Congress through Sept. 16. Admission is
free.

<HEADLINE> Victim Watches Florida Killer Die  </HEADLINE>
By RON WORD
<TEXT>
<P>
   STARKE, Fla. (AP) -- Sixteen years after a bullet fired by Thomas
Provenzano left him paralyzed, Mark Parker watched the convicted
killer die for killing a bailiff in a shootout in an Orlando
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ''He looked scared, pretty damned scared,'' said Parker, who
watched Provenzano's execution Wednesday from his wheelchair. ''I
knew he could tell he wasn't going to get out of this one. I saw
fear in his face.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker, 36, was one of three bailiffs shot in 1984, when
Provenzano entered the courtroom concealing three guns in his
camouflage coat.
</P>
<P>
   Parker and another bailiff, Harry Dalton, 53, were paralyzed;
Dalton died seven years later. Provenzano, 51, was sentenced to
death for the murder of William ''Arnie'' Wilkerson, 60.
</P>
<P>
   A trial judge concluded in December that Provenzano believed he
faced execution because he is Jesus. But the judge ruled that the
execution should proceed because Provenzano also knew he had killed
Wilkerson.
</P>
<P>
   Under Florida law, condemned killers can be executed even if
they are mentally ill, unless they don't understand they are about
to be executed and why.
</P>
<P>
   Provenzano was scheduled to die Tuesday but won a reprieve 11
minutes before he was to be executed, as he lay on a gurney with
intravenous tubes in both arms. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Atlanta, which gave no reason for granting the stay,
lifted it Wednesday morning, and Gov. Jeb Bush rescheduled the
execution immediately.
</P>
<P>
   In Virginia, a death row inmate won a reprieve Wednesday night
from the U.S. Supreme Court about 75 minutes before he was
scheduled to die by injection for the murders of a woman and her
5-year-old daughter in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The high court granted the stay pending an appeal by lawyers for
Russel Burket, 32.

<HEADLINE> Judge Warned for Scolding Sex Victim  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CROWNSVILLE, Md. (AP) -- A state judicial commission has issued a
warning, it's mildest form of reproach, to a judge who suggested
that an 11-year-old girl was partly to blame for being sexually
molested.
</P>
<P>
   The Maryland Judicial Disabilities Commission dismissed a
misconduct complaint against Montgomery County Circuit Judge Durke
G. Thompson, who had scolded the girl by saying ''it takes two to
tango.'' He later apologized.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-member commission issued a ''dismissal with warning''
earlier this month, said Thompson's attorney, Paul Kemp. Thompson,
a circuit judge for six years, did not return telephone messages
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's remarks came Jan. 4, at sentencing of Vladimir
Chacon-Bonilla, 23, who pleaded guilty to a second-degree sex
offense and was sentenced to 18 months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said the girl told police she had sex with
Chacon-Bonilla, whom she met on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's family complained that the incident had ruined their
lives, but the judge said the victim was ''not free of fault''
because she had given the defendant ''some invitation'' into her
home.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the old adage that it takes two to tango is true
here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Organization for Women, a county victims'
assistance agency and a coalition of female state legislators
lodged the complaint with the judicial commission.

<HEADLINE> China Urged To Reopen Taiwan Talks  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is urging
Chinese leaders to reopen talks with Taiwan and to curb exports of
missile technology.
</P>
<P>
   Albright also hopes to learn more about North Korea's overtures
to South Korea and its mysterious leader Kim Jung Il.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's hastily arranged visit is a chance to accelerate a
lowering of tensions in the region, but top aides stressed the
Clinton administration would not relent in its exploration of a
shield against North Korean missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the United States is set to announce negotiations to
stop the development and export of North Korean missile technology,
the program has progressed to the point it poses a threat, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   If the talks succeed, shipments to Iran, Pakistan and possibly
other nations could end, Similarly, Albright is pressing for curbs
on Chinese exports, a long-sought U.S. plea.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations, due to be announced shortly, follow a decision
by North Korea to extend a moratorium on missile flight tests.
</P>
<P>
   Also due soon is an announcement of a visit by a high-level
North Korean official to Washington, as well as talks to reaffirm
North Korea's pledge to halt a nuclear weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Clinton administration lifted a 50-year embargo
on trade with North Korea, permitting American companies and
individuals to trade with and transfer money to North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea responded Wednesday, extending the moratorium on
missile tests it first announced as a suspension nine months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will have a positive effect on Washington high-level
talks,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a State Department spokesman, Philip Reeker,
said, ''We welcome the North Korean statement and the continued
restraint by Pyongyang.''
</P>
<P>
   While the two sides also will hold a new round of talks on
terrorism, North Korea remains on the State Department's list of
sponsors of terrorism. Under U.S. law, that prohibits most U.S. aid
and requires Washington to oppose World Bank loans to North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Albright arrived at dawn Thursday in Beijing
for talks with Chinese leaders. She began her visit by seeing
Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan for a luncheon meeting.
</P>
<P>
   After shaking hands with Tang at the Diaoyutai State Guest
House, Albright said she had ''lots of things to discuss,'' but did
not raise specifics.
</P>
<P>
   Meetings were scheduled later in the day with Vice Premier Qian
Qichen and Premier Zhu Rongji. Albright was due to meet Chinese
President Jiang Zemin Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, she files to Seoul, South Korea, for an update on the
first meeting of the heads of North and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The summit last week in Pyongyang produced an agreement between
South Korea's Kim Dae-jung and North Korea's Kim Jong Il to work
for peace and unity on their bitterly divided peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   The North Korean leader held talks in Beijing before the summit.
Albright intends to press the Chinese, who helped set up the
summit, for more information about him, his economic policy and
whether he is committed to peace on the Korean peninsula, a senior
U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
   The moves toward reconciliation between the two Koreas raised
questions bout the continued presence of some 37,000 U.S. troops in
South Korea as a barrier to invasion from the north. Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
has called on the Clinton administration to begin considering a
pullout.
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials and other key members of Congress
said the threat remains and so should the troops, which cost the
United States an estimated $3.2 billion a year to maintain.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting China for the first time since March 1999, Albright was
given access to a wide range of top officials, including President
Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, inspired by the Korean summit talks, President Chen
Shui-bian renewed an appeal to China to join him at a summit to
resolve a half-century of disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Chen also offered to meet at lower levels, but refused to submit
to a Chinese precondition that he declare there is only one China,
which would reinforce Beijing's view of Taiwan as a rebellious
province that must be absorbed by the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly, he has gone out of his way to try and lower tensions
to indicate that he is a person they can deal with,'' said a senior
U.S. official, speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity.
''We have to emphasize that point.''

<HEADLINE> House Chided Over Gun Vote  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- White House officials are railing against a
House vote to curb the administration's ability to bring more
communities into the federal agreement with Smith &AMP; Wesson, the
giant gun maker.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 218-207 to bar the Department of Housing and
Urban Affairs from working to expand or administer the Communities
for Safer Guns Coalition. In return for Smith &AMP; Wesson's promise to
use gun-safety devices and restrictive sales practices, the 411
localities that have so far joined the coalition have agreed to
make the company's firearms the preferred gun for their law
enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Hostettler, R-Ind., who sponsored the provision, said
in an interview afterward that the vote was ''pretty significant''
because it would mean that ''local law enforcement agencies won't
feel pressure from a federal agency ... in the procurement of
firearms.''
</P>
<P>
   HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo, a prime mover of the gun pact, said
the vote ''strikes at the heart of HUD's ability to work with local
communities to reduce the awful toll of gun violence.''
</P>
<P>
   And in an election-year shot at Republicans, he said the vote
showed the House is ''firmly in the hip holster of gun lobby
extremists.''
</P>
<P>
   The provision was added to a $101 billion spending bill for next
year that already faces a veto threat for cuts it would make in
President Clinton's plans for the environment, public housing and
national service programs.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved the overall bill by 256-169. But White House
budget office spokeswoman Linda Ricci cast doubt on its fate.
</P>
<P>
   ''The gun language is just one more problem on what is already a
very bad bill,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after the vote, the House muddled its message by voting
219-206 to reject a second Hostettler provision that would have
forbidden HUD outright from enforcing the March 17 federal
agreement with Smith &AMP; Wesson, the nation's largest gun
manufacturer. The two votes underlined the pressure lawmakers are
under on the hot button issue of guns, especially with elections
less than five months off.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Walsh, R-N.Y., chief author of the spending bill,
said during the debate that the measure provided no funds
specifically for the gun agreement. That made the amendments
''unnecessary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Hostettler said later that the government often spends money
for activities that are not specified in spending bills, such as
for U.S. troops in Kosovo. With the success of his first amendment,
he said, the Department of Housing and Urban Development would not
be able to issue press releases or have its lawyers help the
coalition of participating communities.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., who led the opposition to
Hostettler's amendments, said the success of his first amendment
was ''absolutely'' a setback.
</P>
<P>
   But she said she hoped the Senate, which has not yet written its
version of the bill, would reject the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Hostettler said he would introduce similar amendments to future
spending bills in an effort to bar the Justice Department and
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms from participating in the
pact.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the gun agreement, Smith &AMP; Wesson agreed to start
installing trigger locks and other gun-safety devices, such as
using ''smart gun'' technology within three years that would allow
only the weapon's owner to use it. In addition, the company agreed
to take such steps as selling guns only after background checks of
the purchaser.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, participating communities have agreed to make Smith
&AMP; Wesson guns the preferred choice for the firearms they purchase
for their law enforcement agencies. That means that when choosing
among similar, equally priced guns, the edge would go to Smith &AMP;
Wesson weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The localities also agreed to drop the company from lawsuits
challenging the gun industry's safety and marketing practices.
</P>
<P>
   Smith &AMP; Wesson has been greeted with hostility from its own
industry for the agreement. The National Rifle Association has
attacked it, and other arms companies have sued it in federal court
for an alleged restraint of trade conspiracy.

<HEADLINE> New Air Quality Standards Delayed  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY McMURRAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted to block enforcement of strict
new air quality standards, erasing for now a long list of cities
and counties that stood to lose funds because they didn't measure
up.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was approved 226-199 Wednesday as an amendment to a
bill appropriating money for housing, veterans and several other
programs. The Senate has not voted on the bill, and there is no
assurance President Clinton will sign the final version.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has agreed to hear arguments on whether the
Environmental Protection Agency must consider the costs of
compliance -- not just health effects -- when it imposes new
environmental standards. A lower court shot down the 1997 standards
last year, contending they were arbitrary numbers based on
questionable science.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the measure cited environmental concerns, arguing
nobody would be penalized until after the high court rules. But
Rep. W.J. Tauzin, R-La., who voted for the amendment, said the mere
cost of preparing for the tests could approach $10 billion
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ''Have we walked through the looking glass with Alice?'' asked
Tauzin. ''Have we now entered Wonderland?''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., said erasing the
noncomplaince list would send a bad message ''by enabling
communities to contend they don't have an air quality problem when
the data indicate they do.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The idea here is dirty air doesn't exist if it isn't
officially recognized,'' Boehlert said.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment was also met with steep resistance from
environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''When people are exposed to unhealthy levels of air pollution,
they ought to know about that,'' said Ed Hopkins, spokesman for the
Sierra Club. ''Essentially what this amendment does is keep them in
the dark.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mac Collins, R-Ga., one of the sponsors of the amendment,
said the Georgia city of Columbus has already spent $66,000 in
anticipation of a new study, even though he contends 98 percent of
the pollutants come from elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In striking down the standards, a three-judge panel of the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia said the EPA
had interpreted the 1990 Clean Air Act ''so loosely'' that it
unlawfully usurped Congress' legislative power.
</P>
<P>
   The revised air standards limited the allowable level of ozone,
an essential part of smog, to 0.08 parts per million, instead of
the 0.12 parts per million under the old requirement. And states
for the first time were required to regulate microscopic
particulates, or soot, from power plants, cars and other sources
down to 2.5 microns, or 28 times smaller than the width of a human
hair.
</P>
<P>
   If the Senate follows suit and votes to delay enforcement of the
new levels, the 1990 standards would still be enforced.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Still Backs Richardson  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- For Bill Richardson, his two worst nightmares
have come true: $2 gasoline and another security scandal at a
nuclear weapons lab. Still, he continues to have the confidence of
his boss, the president.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said Thursday he was not surprised at the
grilling Richardson received on Capitol Hill because of the
severity of the security breach at the Los Alamos weapons lab, but
added, ''I do have confidence in him.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He's dealt with (the security problems) in a forthright and
aggressive manner,'' said Clinton in remarks to reporters at the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   In a span of 10 days, Clinton's affable and ambitious energy
secretary has gone from someone viewed as a Mr. Fix It -- and
possible Democratic vice presidential candidate -- to being the
target of unusually angry congressional attacks.
</P>
<P>
   And Richardson is getting singed by Republicans and Democrats
alike.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've lost all credibility,'' Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala.,
chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told Richardson on
Wednesday as he answered questions about the latest security
breakdown at the Los Alamos nuclear weapons lab.
</P>
<P>
   While Richardson sought to convince senators that he had worked
feverishly over the past year to fix security shortcomings in his
department, Shelby shot back that it was Richardson who was part of
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''Look in the mirror,'' the senator fumed.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost expected from Shelby, a conservative who had made
clear he believes Richardson should resign. But a broadside from
Sen. Robert Byrd, the West Virginia Democrat with 48 years in the
Senate, stunned the hearing room.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have shown an extreme contempt ... of this Congress,''
Byrd lectured Richardson, who had spent 14 years as a congressman
from New Mexico before becoming ambassador to the United Nations
and two years ago energy secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd told Richardson he had made numerous assurances, but had
not followed through. Another rub: Richardson didn't show up for a
hearing on the Los Alamos problem last week, angering senators.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've had a bright and brilliant career. But you will never
again receive the support of the Senate of the United States for
any office to which you might be appointed. It's gone. You've
squandered your treasure,'' Byrd said.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by three of his top assistants, Richardson sat quietly,
taken aback by the intensely personal tone of Byrd's words.
Although at times combative, Richardson was mostly subdued, knowing
that for all purposes he was in the dock and nothing he might say
would help.
</P>
<P>
   ''In two years I've done more on security than has been done in
the last 20 years,'' he told the senators. But they were in no mood
for such explanations.
</P>
<P>
   It was in stark contrast to a year ago when Richardson trekked
regularly to Capitol Hill to try to explain another security flap,
one also involving nuclear secrets at Los Alamos and one of its
scientists, Wen Ho Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, one senator after another praised the fledgling
energy secretary for trying to get to the bottom of the mess and
noted it was not his doing. He was one of their own. It was
Richardson's credentials as a lawmaker and his reputation as an
unorthodox diplomatic troubleshooter that helped ease his task of
convincing Congress that the nuclear security mess would be taken
care of.
</P>
<P>
   But now it has happened again. ''Your assertion that you've been
attempting to address this problem rings hollow,'' said Sen.
Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, summing up the views of many.
</P>
<P>
   It is not only the Los Alamos problem that has made this a
summer of dread for Richardson, but also soaring gasoline prices.
An astute politician, Richardson was quick this week to declare
that he would spend all his time focusing on two issues: Los Alamos
and bringing down the price of gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   But on neither is he likely to have much control over what
happens in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The two issues in tandem may already have sunk any chance that
Richardson, the administration's top-ranking Hispanic, has of
becoming Al Gore's vice presidential running mate, something
Richardson privately is known to covet. His name on the ticket
surely would make campaign issues out of gasoline prices -- should
they remain high -- and nuclear weapons security.
</P>
<P>
   Gregarious and smart, Richardson, 52, has over the years shown a
knack for meeting tough situations head-on. ''I will keep tackling
the tough problems,'' he said following Wednesday's hearing. That's
why as a congressman he made a name for himself, traveling to
countries like Sudan, North Korea and Iraq and through his own
style of diplomacy managing to rescue Americans held there.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's very used to walking into a room and having everybody
with their swords drawn,'' a longtime friend, Earl Potter, said not
long ago. But that was before the latest Los Alamos security
scandal and the gasoline price spike.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday in the Senate, the swords were especially sharp.
</P>
<P>
   After listening to Byrd, Richardson said, ''I hope to earn
Senator Byrd's trust again, maybe not,'' and then mused over his
own career.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was in Congress for 14 years,'' he said. ''I am a man of the
people, and that's the Congress. And, in fact, after I look at my
career, being a congressman was the best job I ever had.''

<HEADLINE> Writer, Journalist Droit Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Michel Droit, a prize-winning French novelist,
journalist and one of 40 members of the prestigious Academie
Francaise, died Thursday, the Academie announced. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   Droit died in La Celle-Saint-Cloud, outside Paris, the Academie
said. No cause of death was given.
</P>
<P>
   A novelist, essayist and editorialist for two decades with the
conservative daily Le Figaro, Droit gained wide acclaim for his
interviews with Gen. Charles de Gaulle.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, he was elected to the Academie Francaise -- one of only
40 ''immortals'' as the institution's members are known -- to fill
the vacancy left by Joseph Kessel.
</P>
<P>
   Droit was born in Vincennes, outside Paris, on Jan. 23, 1923,
and began his journalism career at 21, as a correspondent covering
the French Army in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   He later worked for radio and television, and was the only
journalist in France to interview de Gaulle on television -- in
December 1965, June 1968 and April 1969, a year before the
general's death in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Droit's professional career was intricately linked to de
Gaulle's. In 1972, Droit won the Edmond-Michelet prize for ''A Free
Frenchman,'' a documentary about de Gaulle, France's most
influential postwar leader.
</P>
<P>
   His five-volume ''Man of Destiny'' is widely regarded as one of
the most thorough examinations of de Gaulle's life and work.
</P>
<P>
   Editor in chief at France's state-run television in the early
1960s, Droit launched several successful programs, including ''A
Propos,'' which ran for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Droit worked at Le Figaro's literary supplement from 1961-71,
and went on to write columns for the weekly Figaro Magazine. In
1984, he publishing four volumes of his private diary, and later,
two volumes of memoirs.
</P>
<P>
   He was married and had two children. Funeral arrangements were
pending.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Aid Advances in Congress  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Thursday he is pleased
that his package of anti-narcotics assistance to Colombia is now
advancing in Congress after languishing for months. ''I'm grateful
for it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters before departing on a West Coast trip, the
president praised the Senate for rejecting efforts to trim the
funds and voting Wednesday in favor of a $934 million installment.
He called for quick passage of the plan, saying it is needed to
help Colombia's government maintain social order.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're in the fight of their lives for their very way of
life, with the combined pressure of a guerrilla war that's been
going on for decades and the rise of the narco-traffickers,''
Clinton said. ''The quicker we can reach agreement and show that
the United States is committed to a democracy and to fighting the
drug wars in Colombia ... the better off we're going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the Colombia money would go toward training special
counternarcotics battalions in the Colombian military and for
dozens of American-made helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia is by far the world's largest exporter of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   The overall foreign aid measure is $1.7 billion less than
Clinton had requested, drawing strong complaints -- but no veto
threats -- from the administration. The Senate cut Clinton's request
for $262 million for the world's poorest countries to just $75
million.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate was expected to vote final passage to the bill
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Key components:
</P>
<P>
   -- Israel, at $2.8 billion, remains the largest single recipient
of U.S. aid. The Senate did not attach conditions, despite
complaints about Israel's proposed sale of a $250 million spy plane
to China. Egypt is second with $2.0 billion.
</P>
<P>
   -- Aid to Russia would be conditioned on Moscow's cooperation
with international efforts to provide humanitarian assistance in
Chechnya and to investigate human rights abuses there.
</P>
<P>
   -- The bill includes $25 million in disaster aid to flood-ravaged
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has been pressing Congress to finish work on
the Colombian aid package for months.
</P>
<P>
   It was originally part of $5.2 billion that President Clinton
requested in January that also included money for U.S. troops in
Kosovo and for victims of last September's Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved a $13 billion version on March 30, adding
even more money for the Pentagon and domestic natural disasters and
other projects.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Senate, the bill was split into three pieces attached
to other spending bills, with the Colombia money going onto the
foreign aid one.
</P>
<P>
   Among those criticizing the Colombia money were Democrats who
said they would rather it be spent domestically to prevent drug use
and Republicans reluctant to get involved in a South American civil
war.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's not get into another new armed conflict,'' said Sen.
Slade Gordon, R-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   His amendment to slash all but $200 million of the funds was
rejected 79-19. By a similar margin, the Senate also rejected an
attempt by Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., to divert $225 million to
home-based drug abuse programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Colombia funds may be combined eventually with the money for
Kosovo and disasters and placed in a routine military construction
bill, which would be likely to move quickly through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The foreign aid bill is S. 2522.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Has Surplus Plan  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Days from announcing a colossal $1 trillion
increase in projected federal surpluses, President Clinton said
Thursday that much of the windfall should be spent on reducing the
national debt, not big tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   He revealed few details, other than to confirm that he would
propose shielding Medicare's surpluses from any use but debt
reduction. But congressional Democrats, lobbyists and others
speaking on condition of anonymity have said the 10-year surplus
will be projected at about $1.9 trillion -- more than double the
$746 billion the administration projected in February. The figures
exclude Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Without mentioning names, Clinton also seemed to take a swipe at
likely Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush by warning
that it would be ''a grave error'' to use projected surpluses for
big tax cuts because the surpluses could disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you spend all this in tax cuts or some other mandated
fashion on the front end, and it doesn't materialize, then you will
be right back to the deficits, right back in the higher interest
rates,'' he said as he departed the White House for a West Coast
trip.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would reveal details of his new projections --
and what he would do with the money -- next week.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said Clinton also will propose using the budget
bonanza for faster debt reduction, enhanced Medicare benefits and
deeper tax cuts, they say. The cash deluge has been produced by the
robust economy.
</P>
<P>
   A deep, long-lasting recession could make the projected
surpluses shrink or vanish.
</P>
<P>
   But Treasury Department figures have shown unexpected mountains
of federal revenue in recent months, leaving only the precise size
of the updated surplus estimates unknown. Both major presidential
campaigns have already begun trying to use the new figures to their
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the presumed Democratic candidate, has
used the numbers to justify a torrent of recent spending and tax
proposals. These have included a 10-year, $500 billion tax-cut
package for child care, education and other purposes; voluntary,
tax-free retirement accounts financed partly by federal payments;
and new spending for the environment, health and schools.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Bush, the Texas governor, have tried using the figures
to rebut Democratic arguments that the likely Republican nominee's
budget plans are irresponsible. Bush has proposed a $1.3 trillion,
10-year tax cut. He also would allow Social Security recipients to
invest part of their payroll taxes that support the program in the
stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said the Texan would use extra
surpluses for debt reduction and strengthening Social Security --
both of which are highly popular with the public.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said that next week, Clinton will go beyond his
announcement Tuesday that he would use some of the surplus -- $40
billion over 10 years -- to boost Medicare reimbursements to
hospitals and other health care providers. Those payments are aimed
at restoring cuts made as part of the 1997 budget-balancing deal
that lawmakers now say went deeper than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said Clinton also will propose making his prescription
drug plan for Medicare recipients more generous.
</P>
<P>
   They said they expect him to propose starting the part of the
plan aimed at helping people with catastrophic illnesses earlier
than expected. They said he might propose starting it in 2003, when
his overall prescription plan would begin, instead of 2006, which
he proposed in his 2001 budget in February.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's prescription drug plan would cost $149 billion over 10
years, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated. Clinton said
the catastrophic portion of it would cost $35 billion from 2006
through 2010, but he provided no details of how it would work.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also will endorse fencing off Medicare's projected
surpluses from use for spending or tax cuts. That idea is also
supported by Gore, and the House voted 420-2 Tuesday to do the same
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers routinely have spent Medicare surpluses for other
purposes for decades. But now, surpluses have grown so large that
politicians have found there is enough money for spending and tax
cuts without using the Medicare funds.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also will propose using a large portion of the new
surplus to accelerate elimination of the $3.5 trillion publicly
held portion of the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   His budget envisioned eliminating that debt by 2013. The new
numbers will move up that date, perhaps to sometime within the next
decade, Democrats said.
</P>
<P>
   The overall national debt is $5.7 trillion. The remaining $2.2
trillion is money the government owes its own trust funds, like
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also will propose extra spending for education and other
domestic programs, Democrats said, but not for fiscal 2001, the
year for which Congress is now writing spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said Clinton will also make his tax-cut proposal
bigger.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that, he is expected to eliminate some of the tax
increases he proposed in February to help pay for his budget
initiatives. Most of those proposed tax increases had virtually no
chance of being approved by Congress anyway, and dropping them will
let him boast a bigger net tax-cut figure.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Has Fun With Lockhart Photo  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nice hair? Nice legs? Clean feet? Alert?
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton scribbled those questions on an aging
photograph of an unrecognizable, bushy-haired man asleep or
unconscious on a chaise longue, barefoot with a pair of flip-flop
sandals at his side. A mug sits next to the recliner.
</P>
<P>
   ''Memo from the president. Attention. Who is this man?'' the
president scrawled on the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out it was a much younger Joe Lockhart, now the
president's press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ''He looks like he's been knocked out because he put his hand in
an electrical circuit,'' Clinton said, showing off the Lockhart
photo during a surprise visit to the press briefing room Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said a buddy of Lockhart's gave him the picture last
week in Texas. The president had it framed and brought it to the
briefing room to find a home.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I'll put it right here (on the lectern),'' Clinton
said. ''This is the Joe Lockhart memorial podium. I love it. He'll
never forgive me for showing it.'' The president eventually was
persuaded that the photo belonged on a hallway wall leading into
the press office.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's inscription said: ''He's practicing for his life's
work -- being White House press secretary -- the president's
finest.''

   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) -- An American man visiting St.
Petersburg threw his 5-month-old daughter out of a 16th-floor
window and then jumped to his death after her, police and consulate
officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Police were treating the deaths Wednesday as a murder-suicide,
consulate spokesman Tom Leary said.

   The man came to Russia on a tourist visa June 4 with his wife

police. The child had been ill because of injuries suffered during
birth, Stepchenko said.

<HEADLINE> Aeroflot Protests U.S. Smoking Ban  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's largest air carrier has accused the
United States of breaking international law by banning smoking on
all scheduled airline flights between the United States and other
countries, the company said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Aeroflot appealed to the International Air Transport Association
this week, asking it to decide whether the ban, which went into
effect June 4, was legal.
</P>
<P>
   ''By introducing the new regulation, the United States has
extended its law to foreign legal entities beyond its territory,
which blatantly contradicts the norms of international law,''
Aeroflot said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Many Russian smokers used to choose Aeroflot for long-distance
flights because it allowed smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Smoking is widespread in Russia, and is allowed in most public
places.

Religious groups respond to Supreme Court prayer ruling 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A leading Islamic advocacy group joined
Christian conservatives in objecting to this week's U.S. Supreme
Court ruling that student-led prayers at football games are
unconstitutional. ''As demonstrated by the increase in violence,
sexual promiscuity and drug use at schools throughout the country,
there is clearly a need for more student-sponsored spiritual
guidance, not less,'' said a statement by the Council on
American-Islamic Relations.
</P>
<P>
   The Fellowship of Christian Athletes called the decision a
''bizarre and ironic intrusion in the religious life and expression
of American student athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Council of Churches, on the other hand, said, ''The
court wisely recognized that participation in these prayers might
not be voluntary for all students.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Jewish Congress called the decision ''an important
victory because it firmly dispels any notion that schools can evade
the constitutional mandate of religious neutrality in the
schools.''

Linking religion and medicine called scientifically questionable
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The trend toward incorporating religion and
spirituality into health care is ethically and scientifically
questionable, according to an article in this week's New England
Journal of Medicine by a group of Christian, Jewish, Buddhist, and
Muslim biomedical researchers and chaplains.
</P>
<P>
   Combining the two ''leads to weak science (and) watered-down
religion,'' said the article whose lead author was Richard P.
Sloan, director of behavioral medicine at Columbia-Presbyterian
Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are troubled by the uncritical embrace of this trend by the
general public, individual physicians and American medical
schools,'' the article said.
</P>
<P>
   The authors stated that ''limited, narrowly focused and
methodologically flawed studies'' are leading to false conclusions
that religious activity promotes healing, that patients should be
encouraged to participate in such activities, and that patients
want a spiritual component to their medical care.
</P>
<P>
   ''Attempts to link religion to health oversimplifies both,'' the
authors concluded.

Jehovah's Witnesses' blood transfusion policy restated
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Jehovah's Witnesses will continue to reject
members who defy the group's prohibition of most blood
transfusions, an official of the denomination said.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman James Pellechia dismissed as misleading news reports
that the longstanding policy had been reversed.
</P>
<P>
   The group acknowledges that it has ended its practice of
''disfellowshipping'' -- or excommunicating -- members who receive
blood transfusions. But Pellechia said that a Jehovah's Witness who
has a transfusion automatically ''revokes his membership.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It has the same effect,'' said Pellechia.
</P>
<P>
   Why the semantic change? Pellechia said the group is simply
stating more accurately that a person who rejects its tenets
chooses to leave.
</P>
<P>
   But Raymond Franz, a former Jehovah's Witness who once served on
the group's Governing Body, believes the Jehovah's Witness
leadership hopes that publicly ending the practice of
disfellowshipping will lessen negative perceptions of the group in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Pellechia notes that for two decades some Jehovah's Witnesses
have believed that the transfusion of fractions derived from major
blood components is allowable.

Reformed Church freezes United Church relations over gay dispute
</P>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- The Reformed Church in America has
sidestepped calls from nine regional units to break ecumenical
fellowship with the United Church of Christ because it supports
homosexual activity.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a national synod accepted officials' proposal to freeze
United Church relations at the current level.
</P>
<P>
   In a second ecumenical action, the synod voted to apply for
membership in the National Association of Evangelicals. If the bid
is accepted, the Reformed Church would be the first denomination to
belong to both that conservative association and the more liberal
National Council of Churches.

Report: Tibetan monastery faces closure over monks' activities
</P>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- A Tibetan monastery has been threatened with
closure following the arrests of four of its monks for shouting
slogans against Chinese rule, a monitoring group says.
</P>
<P>
   Buddhist monks were confined to Taglung Drag monastery near
Lhasa for a month after the arrests last year, the Tibet
Information Network said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
   Obligatory political study by the monks was also stepped-up and
monks were threatened with expulsion and the closure of the
monastery unless they denounced the Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled
spiritual leader, the group said.
</P>
<P>
   In response, 16 of the monastery's 26 remaining monks left in
September, the group said.
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown came after monks Phuntsog Legmon, 18, and Namdrol,
24, were sentenced to three and four years respectively for
shouting pro-independence slogans in Lhasa in March 1999, the
center said, adding that the two were severely beaten while in
detention.
</P>
<P>
   Buddhist clergy have often played a leading role in Tibetan
opposition to Chinese rule. Chinese troops invaded Tibet in 1949,
claiming that the western region had been a part of China for
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of Chinese rule say Tibet was effectively independent
for most of that time, and accuse China of suppressing Tibetan
religion and trying to dilute its native culture.

Church's youth group playing matchmaker for pastor
</P>
<P>
   BELLEVILLE, Mich. (AP) -- In his day, Belleville Church of God
pastor Doug George has given his blessings to marrying couples, all
the while having a tough time finding a bride for himself.
</P>
<P>
   That soon may change, if his church's youth group gets its way.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-agers are schooling the 32-year-old George on the
etiquette of dating, and the minister says he's heeding the advice.
They've even given him a makeover, including a new hairstyle and
fashionable wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   All with the goal of helping find him the right mate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're desperately trying to hook this man up,'' said Jason
Yaeger, 17. ''He needs a woman in his life.''
</P>
<P>
   George is tickled that his youth group is eager to help him get
hitched.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm definitely lonely,'' said George, the church's youth
pastor for the past six years. ''I'm ready to settle down and have
a family. I'm not embarrassed to admit it.''
</P>
<P>
   So the kids, ages 13 to 18, have taken it upon themselves to
play Cupid.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everywhere I go, I try to keep an eye out for someone who'd
make a good wife,'' said Yaeger, George's hair and fashion
consultant. ''It's a lot harder than we thought it would be.''

<HEADLINE> Religion Today  </HEADLINE>
By KIA SHANT'E BREAUX
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- When Massimo Introvigne of Italy
wants up-to-date information on an obscure religious sect or cult,
he logs on to www.religiousmovements.org.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the best out there in terms of being like an online
encyclopedia,'' said Introvigne, managing director of the Center
for Studies on New Religions based in Torino, Italy. ''Other Web
sites just have piecemeal information on nontraditional
religions.''
</P>
<P>
   The detailed, alphabetical profiles of more than 250 religious
groups and movements aren't put together by some large, well-paid
Web design company. They're churned out by University of Virginia
students in a high-tech classroom half a world away. The religious
movements site has developed a faithful following worldwide,
attracting more than a million hits per month.
</P>
<P>
   ''The goal of the site is to promote tolerance and appreciation
of religions without preference to a particular faith,'' said
sociology professor Jeffrey Hadden, who developed the Web site with
students in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Hadden was awarded a teaching technology fellowship that allowed
him to explore how modern communications technologies can be used
in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Each student who signs up for Hadden's Sociology 257 class picks
a group to write about and designs a Web page on that organization.
The best work becomes part of the permanent Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Students this year wrote profiles on China's Falun Gong
movement, Father Divine's International Peace Mission Movement,
channeling, and Marcus Garvey and his Universal Negro Improvement
Association. The profiles provide details on how the movements have
emerged, and how they've grown or faded.
</P>
<P>
   Hadden's classroom is equipped with computers for each student
and a large screen that allows students to follow along with Hadden
as he surfs the Web. The syllabus and other course material are
distributed online, and Hadden often communicates with students by
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis on technology scared some students.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was literally afraid of computers,'' said Jackie Fowler, who
took Hadden's class in 1997. ''It was a chance for me to get over
my phobia and learn to be more objective about religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Hagerty, who took the class this year, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to establish my own opinion about religious groups
without just going on what I've heard or read about them,'' Hagerty
said. ''I wanted to try to understand what they are doing without
being too critical of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Robinson, head of Ontario Consultants on Religious
Tolerance in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, said the students do a good
job researching and describing religions objectively.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a serious problem in the United States, Canada and
Europe with anti-cult movements. There are thousands of small,
obscure religions and every now and then they go terribly wrong and
many people die,'' Robinson said. ''But sometimes people falsely
label groups as cults. The students' essays are written without
bias. That's rare to find on the Internet these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Introvigne, whose association of scholars operates the largest
European Web site on new religious movements, said his group looks
to Hadden's site as a model.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is really an inspiration for us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hadden came to national attention with his 1969 book, ''The
Gathering Storm in the Churches,'' which looked at the conflict
within mainstream Protestant churches after the participation of
clergy in social action projects.
</P>
<P>
   He had taught the religious movements class for 20 years at the
University of Virginia when he developed the Web site. At the time,
he described himself as a ''technophobe.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, his widely used site includes a collection of online
lectures and links to thousands of other Internet resources on
religious movements. Among them are two other sites developed by
Hadden, on religious broadcasters and religious freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   Hadden spends several hours a day, checking information on the
Web site for accuracy and responding to hundreds of e-mails. While
most of the comments about the site are positive, Hadden gets his
share of hate mail.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of anti-cultists out there and they mistake
the Web site as being a source to advocate these groups,'' said
Hadden. ''I try to make it clear that I'm simply a defender of
religious freedoms.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 60; Nasdaq Slides 36  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks edged lower Thursday as traders took
profits from a runup in technology shares.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 60.11 points at 10,437.63, and the Nasdaq
composite index was down 35.92 at 4,028.09.
</P>
<P>
   Tech shares giving up ground included Micron Technology, which
fell $3.813 to $86.938 as traders worried that the chip maker's
earnings, due out later in the day, might not be as strong as hoped
for.
</P>
<P>
   Mobile phone maker Nokia also lost ground, slipping $4.375 to
$56.625, and rival Ericsson also fell $1.688 to $20.563.
</P>
<P>
   Other tech bellwethers that have been on the upswing in recent
days also gave back some ground, including Intel, off $1.75 at
$137.25, and International Business Machines, down $1.50 to $113.
Yahoo! fell $5.563 to $137.25 after an analyst expressed concerns
about the outlook for online advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which led the market higher Wednesday, reversed an
earlier slide from the morning and was up 43.8 cents at $81.125.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into Thursday's trading, the Nasdaq index had climbed
for five straight sessions, nearly returning to where it began the
year. At its low point on May 23, the Nasdaq was down 28.6 percent
since the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Traders were also looking ahead to the Federal Reserve's regular
meeting next Tuesday and Wednesday. There have been signals that
the economy has been slowing in response to the Fed's series of
interest rate increases, but investors are still bracing for the
possibility that the Fed may tighten credit further to keep
inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're seeing some profit taking,'' said Tom Galvin, chief
equity straegist at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Securities. ''I
think we're digesting the gains of the Nasdaq over the past four
weeks and looking ahead to the Fed meeting and the likelihood of
several earnings confessions next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Traders said there was little effect from a rumor, quickly
denied by the Fed, that the central bank's chairman, Alan
Greenspan, was in an auto accident.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was off 15.90 at 1,463.23, and
the Russell 2000 index off 1.60 at 526.01.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by a 8-to-5 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 446.24 million
shares at midday, down slightly from 460.54 million shares the same
time Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> EPA: Wholesale Gas Prices Drop  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, confronting a political
firestorm over soaring gasoline costs, said Thursday ''there is no
economic explanation I can think of for the run-up in the prices.''
He promised the government would wage an aggressive inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Wholesale gasoline prices have dropped more than 25 cents a
gallon over the past week in cities where prices at the pump are
still over $2 and rising. The industry says retailers just haven't
yet caught up to the decline.
</P>
<P>
   The high prices popped up in the presidential race, with Vice
President Al Gore blaming the oil companies while his Republican
rival, George W. Bush, accused the Clinton administration of
failing to persuade oil exporters to increase production.
</P>
<P>
   Although he blamed poor diplomacy, Bush, the Texas governor and
a former oilman, also said it was fair and healthy for the
government to investigate the price spike.
</P>
<P>
   Gore suggested price gouging. ''Big oil may have gotten too
big,'' he said Wednesday. He quickly added he was not suggesting a
breakup of oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   Taking aim at Gore, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
said the problem is ''much, much bigger'' than Gore's remarks
allow. The main problem, Lott said Thursday, is U.S. dependence on
foreign oil.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton expressed concern that higher gas prices would ''rifle
throughout our economy,'' suggesting that oil prices ideally should
be ''somewhere in the neighborhood of $20 to $25 a barrel.'' The
main U.S. crude oil, West Texas Intermediate, rose 72 cents
Wednesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, where contracts for
August delivery closed at $31.37 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Congress needs to help the administration combat
higher prices by passing his proposals to encourage more
stripper-well production, reauthorize the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve, approve research funds for alternative energy programs and
enact an electricity restructuring bill. The president spoke with
reporters on the South Lawn before leaving on a trip to Arizona and
California.
</P>
<P>
   OPIS Energy Group, a private company that tracks national energy
prices in detail, reported a dramatic decline in wholesale gasoline
prices in the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Louis areas over the past
week. All three areas are among cities that have been required to
sell only a new blend of cleaner gasoline because of severe summer
pollution problems.
</P>
<P>
   According to the figures, wholesale prices in Chicago peaked at
$1.60 a gallon June 15 and dropped to $1.41 Tuesday, plummeting an
additional 10 cents the next day to $1.31, a drop of 29 cents.
Meanwhile, retail prices at the pump increased by two pennies to
$2.13 during the same week.
</P>
<P>
   Retail prices in Milwaukee also increased slightly during the
week to $2.02 Wednesday, while wholesale prices fell from $1.58
June 15 to $1.33, a decline of 25 cents. St. Louis saw wholesale
prices decline by 13 cents, while retail prices went up nearly 4
cents during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   The average price of gasoline for the nation on Wednesday was
$1.64 a gallon, according to AAA, the automobile association.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Browner, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, said
she was struck by the fact that the decline in wholesale prices
coincided with demands for an investigation of Midwest gasoline
prices by the Federal Trade Commission. The EPA and Energy
Department had urged the FTC to begin such an investigation on June
15. The agency disclosed Tuesday that a formal investigation has
begun.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one has explained to us why these prices were so high, why
when we call for an explanation, when we call for an investigation
... suddenly the prices begin to drop,'' said Browner.
</P>
<P>
   Oil industry spokesmen denied any connection.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market is working. The prices are falling,'' said Red
Cavaney, president of the American Petroleum Institute, the oil
industry trade group. Cavaney said numbers he has seen showed that
the decline in wholesale prices actually began about a week earlier
than cited by Browner.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission as part of its formal investigation
is expected to examine, among other things, wholesale and retail
price fluctuations and whether they indicate any collusion among
oil companies, refiners, distributors and wholesale and retail
marketers.
</P>
<P>
   Cavaney rejected suggestions that oil companies are illegally
setting prices or otherwise gouging consumers. High gasoline prices
in the Midwest were the result of ''a whole set of circumstances''
from distribution problems and low inventories to higher crude
prices and difficulties in blending the cleaner burning gas using
corn-based ethanol, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ethanol industry has accused the oil industry of trying to
make the corn-based fuel a scapegoat for high prices when the EPA
says ethanol blended cleaner gasoline should add only about 8 cents
to the price.

<HEADLINE> GOP Enlists Security Advisers  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHNGTON (AP) -- Republican congressional leaders announced
Thursday the formation of an election-year advisory panel of
outspoken Clinton administration critics to study breaches of
nuclear secrets and other national security issues.
</P>
<P>
   The panel will be chaired by former Defense Secretary Donald
Rumsfeld, said House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll ask the members of this group to review the
administration's record of failure in safeguarding our nation's
most important secrets,'' Lott told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The panel reads like a who's who of prominent administration
detractors on defense and foreign policy issues -- and several on
the list have advised Republican presidential candidate George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Members include former secretaries of state Henry Kissinger and
George Shultz, former defense secretaries Richard Cheney, James
Schlesinger, Caspar Weinberger and Frank Carlucci, former CIA
Director James Woolsey, former national security advisers Brent
Scowcroft and Richard V. Allen and former Joint Chiefs of Staff
Chairman Colin Powell.
</P>
<P>
   ''We in the leadership are extremely fortunate to be able to tap
the knowledge and expertise of these seasoned national security
advisers,'' Hastert said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Woolsey is the only one on the list to have worked in the
Clinton administration, as CIA director early in Clinton's term
from 1993-95. But since then, he has been a frequent critic of the
administration's national security policy.
</P>
<P>
   The others all worked in the administrations of Republican
presidents Ford, Reagan and Bush -- although Schlesinger also did a
short stint as Democratic President Jimmy Carter's energy
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said the panel was not an attempt to bypass the committee
system in the House and the Senate, ''but the expertise that can be
brought to the speaker and me in critical areas from this group
could be very helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the group would look into the recent disappearance of
computer disks at the Los Alamos nuclear lab -- and their mysterious
reappearance -- and would make recommendations on further tightening
security.
</P>
<P>
   The group will also provide advice on ''national missile
defense, deployment and the deployment decision, relations with
China, Russia, Iraq (and) what is the true situation in North
Korea,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   ''As you know, we've had security lapses at the State
Department, we've had them with FBI files showing up on White House
kitchen tables, we had the problem of former CIA Director John
Deutch. Security is not getting the attention it should have been
getting,'' Lott added.
</P>
<P>
   Lott also used his news conference to offer some unsolicited
criticism of Vice President Al Gore, noting that he had broken a
tie in the Senate on a budget bill that included a rise in the
federal excise tax on gasoline by 4.3 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   ''And of course, he thinks the internal combustion engine is a
really bad idea,'' Lott asserted. He did not elaborate.

<HEADLINE> Russians Running Into Visa Hassles  </HEADLINE>
By NICK WADHAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- For decades, Russians looking to go abroad were
stuck at home by state-enforced travel bans.
</P>
<P>
   Now, their travel yearnings are being clipped by destination
countries that are afraid Russians will overstay their welcome.
</P>
<P>
   With the economy in shambles and the perception in the West that
poorer Russians will use any chance they can to abandon their
country, applicants are faced with arbitrary, sometimes unexplained
interpretations of visa regulations that require proof they won't
emigrate, critics say.
</P>
<P>
   Police were called to the Italian Embassy on Wednesday after a
group of exasperated tour agents demanded an explanation for delays
in visas that were ruining their clients' vacation plans.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden flash of anger contrasted with Russians' usual
forbearance in dealing with bureaucratic hassles and made national
news.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday, applicants were still elbowing each other out of
the way near the embassy's front gate, some after waiting
overnight. Others paced nervously outside, complaining about
Russians' need for a visa to go almost anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Russians needed permission from the Soviet
government to leave the country -- permission that was often denied.
</P>
<P>
   Today's visa hassles have been a particular disappointment for
Russia's middle class, which has taken advantage of the lifting of
state restrictions to go on vacations despite meager salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just imagine if I have a client going on a world cruise that
visits 30 or 40 countries over four months, and every country needs
a visa,'' said Adriana Voronova, a visa expert with the Neptune
travel agency in Moscow. ''There aren't enough pages in a passport
to get all the necessary visa information in there.''
</P>
<P>
   The wait outside embassies of most popular destinations can be
several hours long. The long lines have created a service culture
catering to applicants: hawkers offer travel insurance, tour
packages, food, or a place to stay to visa applicants from
throughout Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ''They problem is the misconduct of the consular officers
themselves,'' said Marina Kriliouk, a lawyer and vocal critic of
Western governments' treatment of Russian visa applicants. ''They
have too wide discretion in deciding who qualifies for a visa.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States consular office is the subject of some of the
harshest complaints. Applicants say there's often nothing they can
do to prove they won't stay.
</P>
<P>
   ''They said there was no proof that I wouldn't stay there,''
said 20-year-old Lilia Lipovaya, emerging from an interview at the
U.S. Embassy after she learned her visa application had been
rejected for the second time in three months.
</P>
<P>
   ''I gathered so many documents that I don't know what other
papers there are to get.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials say they accept three-fourths of the
applications, proof that it isn't that hard to get a visa to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Just as offensive for many Russians are the strict visa
requirements recently introduced by two former Soviet satellites,
the Czech Republic and Slovakia, in bids to gain entry into the
European Union. The rules have fostered a belief that Russians
aren't welcome in the new Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ''All these barriers that have to be gotten around make me, as a
person who considers himself dignified, want to stay home,'' said
architect Alexei Lokhov, waiting for a visa outside the Czech
Embassy in Moscow.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Bans Firearms Sales  </HEADLINE>
By STAN LEHMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Marco Aurelio Sprovieri is the owner of
one of Sao Paulo's largest gun stores and cannot sell firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government just declared my bankruptcy,'' Sprovieri said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a sweeping anti-crime package announced Tuesday, the
government issued a decree forbidding issuing gun permits for six
months in a nation where recent statistics say a killing takes
place every 13 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The decree, which went into effect Wednesday, in effect imposes
a nationwide ban on firearm sales, because nobody can buy a gun
without a permit.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a six-month ban,'' Sprovieri said by phone. ''It's
going to last forever, because the government can and will renew
the decree until the law (on gun control) is passed.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Our store, which first opened its doors for business 75 years
ago, will have to shut down. The government has wiped us out. It is
really absurd. Criminals don't buy their weapons in stores.''
</P>
<P>
   The decree suspends issuing of gun permits until Dec. 31, 2000,
and exempts only the armed forces, and federal, state and municipal
law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Gall, executive director of the Fernand Braudel Institute
of World Economics, a Sao Paulo-based think tank that has studied
violence, agrees the decree ''will have absolutely no impact on
diminishing crime.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Legally purchased weapons are not the problem,'' Gall said.
''The illegal ones, mostly bought on the contraband market are the
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the ban could even increase the demand for illegal
weapons ''like prohibition did with booze in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The ban may even increase crime rates because criminals could
feel bolder knowing law-abiding citizens are unarmed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilians own an estimated eight million guns, of which about
six million are unregistered and mostly in the hands of criminals,
government figures say.
</P>
<P>
   The government acted when it became aware that a gun control
bill being discussed in Congress could take several months before
being approved while the country was clamoring for action because
of rampant crime and recent violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''Society is demanding from all of us a quicker response,''
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said when he announced the
National Security Plan with the decree on gun permits.
</P>
<P>
   ''We could ask, who among us has not suffered because of
violence?''
</P>
<P>
   The National Security Plan aslo includes hiring 2,000 new
federal agents, providing better training and equipment for police
forces and building new prisons.
</P>
<P>
   The 124-step, $1.7 million National Security Plan was announced
a week after a bus kidnapping that left a 20-year-old teacher and
her kidnapper dead.
</P>
<P>
   The episode shocked viewers who followed the incident on live
television for four hours.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil ranked fourth last year in kidnappings after Colombia,
Mexico and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The bill in Congress would restrict possession of firearms to
the armed forces, police, private security personnel, collectors
and gun clubs, people in rural areas, and private security
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone else would have 360 days to turn in their guns and
ammunition under the Congress bill. Those who return the guns will
be compensated, but the bill doesn't say by how much. Illegal
weapons would be confiscated.
</P>
<P>
   The country's two biggest arms manufacturers -- Rossi and Taurus
-- would not immediately comment on the ban.

<HEADLINE> Dow Sheds 34; Nasdaq Loses 18  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks edged lower Thursday as traders took
profits from a runup in technology shares.
</P>
<P>
   In midafternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 34.30 at 10,463.44, while the Nasdaq composite
index was down 17.70 at 4,046.31.
</P>
<P>
   Tech shares that were giving up ground included Micron
Technology, which fell $3.934 to $86.813 as traders worried that
the chip maker's earnings, due out later in the day, might fall
short of expectations. Mobile phone maker Nokia was also down,
slipping $4.875 to $56.125.
</P>
<P>
   Among tech bellwethers that were retreating from recent gains,
Intel was off $1.8125 at $137.188 and International Business
Machines was down $1.438 to $113.063. Yahoo! fell $5.375 to
$137.438 after an analyst expressed concerns about the outlook for
online advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which led the market higher Wednesday, reversed a
morning slide and was up $1.063 at $81.75 Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into Thursday's trading, the Nasdaq index had climbed
for five straight sessions, nearly returning to where it began the
year. At its low point on May 23, the Nasdaq was down 28.6 percent
since the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Traders were also looking ahead to the Federal Reserve's regular
meeting Tuesday and Wednesday. There have been signals that the
economy has been slowing in response to the Fed's series of
interest rate increases, but investors are still bracing for the
possibility that the Fed may tighten credit further to keep
inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're seeing some profit-taking,'' said Tom Galvin, chief
equity strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Securities. ''I
think we're digesting the gains of the Nasdaq over the past four
weeks and looking ahead to the Fed meeting and the likelihood of
several earnings confessions next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Traders said there was little effect from a rumor, quickly
denied by the Fed, that the central bank's chairman, Alan
Greenspan, was in an auto accident.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by an 8-to-5 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 656.95 million
shares in afternoon trading, down slightly from 669.77 million
shares as of the same time Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was off 13.54 at 1,465.59, and
the Russell 2000 index was down 1.18 at 526.43.

<HEADLINE> Barak Salvages Coalition Government  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN LAUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Prime Minister Ehud Barak salvaged his shaky
government Thursday with a last-minute political maneuver and won
assurances from a rebellious party that it would not challenge him
again, at least while he tries to negotiate a peace treaty with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   However, Barak's diverse six-party alliance may not hold
together long enough to get such a historic accord approved by
Israel's parliament.
</P>
<P>
   In defusing this week's political crisis, which was replete with
threats, ultimatums and all-night negotiations, Barak survived the
worst threat to his government during his one-year rule.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly relieved, a beaming prime minister addressed loyalists
of his One Israel party after he got word that the religious Shas
party had withdrawn its resignation 20 minutes before it was to
have taken effect Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Barak appealed to all parties to set aside their squabbling.
''We cannot let the rage take over,'' he said, referring to the
bitter feuding between Shas and its nemesis, the secular Meretz
party, that had nearly torn apart the coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's political drama had raised questions about a renewed
U.S. effort to mediate between Israel and the Palestinians. Had
Barak lost his parliamentary majority Thursday, there would have
been little reason for Washington to press on.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's Mideast envoy, Dennis Ross, arrived in
Jerusalem and was to hold talks with Barak later Thursday. Next
week, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will join Ross to
assess prospects for convening a Mideast summit in Washington that
Clinton would play host.
</P>
<P>
   In such a summit, Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
would try to reach final agreement on the terms of Palestinian
statehood. A treaty is due in September, and negotiators have made
little progress in solving their disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Israel wants a summit soon. However, Palestinian negotiator Saeb
Erekat said Thursday there was no point in convening a top-level
gathering until Israel has honored its outstanding commitments,
including an additional West Bank troop withdrawal. The
Palestinians expect Ross to bring with him U.S. guarantees that the
pullback, initially due Friday, will be carried out within two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Shas, meanwhile, signaled that it would not try to sabotage
Barak's peace moves, for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   ''Barak can go to the United States in the near future ... for
the continuation of the peace process,'' Shas leader Eli Ishai
said, referring to a possible summit. ''But we haven't committed to
the results of the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Shas' founder, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, is a political moderate, but
the party's supporters are overwhelmingly hawkish. Throughout the
years, Shas has zigzagged on land-for-peace issues, fearful of
losing popular support.
</P>
<P>
   A peace treaty needs to win an absolute majority of 61
legislators in the 120-seat parliament before passing yet another
hurdle -- a national referendum. Shas, with its 17 legislators, is
seen by Barak as crucial to obtaining the necessary votes.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition crisis was triggered by a dispute that had nothing
to do with Mideast peacemaking. Shas sought more state funds for
its bankrupt private school system and balked at demands by Meretz
leader Yossi Sarid, the education minister, to control the flow of
the money.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the immediate argument, Shas and Meretz have been bitter
enemies for years, reflecting the deep divides in Israeli society.
Shas represents low-income, religiously observant Israelis with
Middle Eastern roots. Meretz is the party of choice for well-to-do,
dovish Israelis from a European background.
</P>
<P>
   Shas has denounced Sarid as an arrogant racist, while the Meretz
leader has accused Shas of trying to extort money from the state.
</P>
<P>
   Meretz, which has made a peace treaty with the Palestinians a
top priority, reluctantly paved the way for Shas' return to the
government when Meretz' three Cabinet ministers resigned late
Wednesday. Meretz will remain a partner in the coalition, and said
it would loyally support Barak in his peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Suggesting that Barak forced the resignations on Meretz, Sarid
said ''there were a lot of strong hints'' that this was the only
option.
</P>
<P>
   Barak thanked Meretz, saying that ''there are few precedents for
such a sacrifice for the common good.''

<HEADLINE> Chinese Plane Crash Kills 42  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- A Chinese domestic airliner flying in stormy
weather was struck by lightning and crashed Thursday in central
China, killing all 42 people aboard, state media and officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Wuhan Airline's flight, carrying 38 passengers and four
crew, came down at 3 p.m. in a rural suburb of Wuhan, an industrial
center and capital of Hubei province.
</P>
<P>
   ''We lost contact'' with the plane, said an official at Wuhan's
Wangjiadun Airport, who refused to give her name.
</P>
<P>
   The state-run Xinhua News Agency said the plane, a domestically
made YUN-7, was descending for landing when lightning struck and
the aircraft exploded. It said all 42 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was raining very hard,'' said a government official in
nearby Yongfeng township. ''The weather was very bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Bodies, bits of wreckage and debris from passengers' luggage
fell on the banks of the Han River and nearby dikes, Xinhua said.
It quoted witnesses as saying the falling debris upset a dredging
boat in the river and that several people were missing.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether any people on the ground were hurt or
confirmed killed.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the plane plunged into a farmer's house, a local
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Photos from Xinhua showed the plane's tail sinking into the
river. Rescuers pulled at part of the plane on a dike in Shitai
village, 12 to 18 miles from Wuhan.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators found one of the plane's two flight data recorders
and were searching for the other, Xinhua said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, which seated 54, was flying from Hubei's Enshi county
to Wuhan, Xinhua said.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen of the passengers were from Enshi, with the others
coming from Wuhan, Beijing and other parts of China, the agency
said.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday night, more than 30 relatives gathered at a nearby
hotel, waiting for word of whether the bodies had been retrieved,
Xinhua said.
</P>
<P>
   Wuhan Airlines immediately grounded the three other YUN-7s in
its fleet as part of its investigation, Xinhua reported.
</P>
<P>
   The YUN-7 is reputed to be among the most reliable of China's
few domestically made planes. State-run Xi'an Aircraft Corporation
began manufacturing the YUN-7 in 1986, offering passenger and cargo
models. There are currently 132 YUN-7 being used in China,
according to recent state media reports.
</P>
<P>
   The accident was the first major airplane crash in China since a
Korean Air cargo slammed into a Shanghai construction site 14
months ago, killing the three-member crew and six people on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Two months earlier, in February 1999, a China Southwest Airlines
passenger plane crashed in a field 250 miles south of Shanghai in
China's coastal Zhejiang province. All 61 people aboard the
Russian-built TU-154 were killed.

<HEADLINE> Military Health Plan Revamp Urged  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Effectively combating fraud, improving
purchases of prescription drugs and other steps could save millions
of dollars for the government's health care program for the
military, a congressional auditor told lawmakers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Opportunities exist to save potentially hundreds of millions
of dollars that could be used to purchase care for military
beneficiaries,'' Stephen Backhus, director of veterans' affairs and
military health care issues for the General Accounting Office, told
a House Budget Committee task force.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department's managed health care plan, known as
TRICARE, provides health care to active-duty personnel as well as
dependents and military retirees.
</P>
<P>
   The program spends about $225 million a year just processing
claims, a cost that has drawn criticism from many in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is critical that Congress do all it can to help the federal
government keep its commitment to military retirees and their
families,'' said Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, and chairman of the
task force on defense and international relations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fixing the administrative inefficiencies in the current health
care system'' is one way to achieve that goal, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The national average cost to process a Medicare claim last year
was $1.78 compared with $7.50 for a claim under the TRICARE
program, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Government and private sector officials cautioned that it is
difficult to compare the two programs. Medicare is a
fee-for-service program while TRICARE is a managed care program
with a complex system of authorizations, referrals and provider
networks.
</P>
<P>
   Also, TRICARE represents a small amount of a provider's income,
leaving little incentive for doctors to upgrade their networks to
file claims electronically, officials said. Electronic claims would
significantly cut costs for the program.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Backhus and other auditors outlined some possible ways to
save money:
</P>
<P>
   --An effective anti-fraud program could recover the estimated
$290 million to $580 million lost to fraud annually.
</P>
<P>
   --The Defense Department and Veterans Administration could join
in buying pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   --Reforming TRICARE operations such as mailroom handling and
document preparation.

<HEADLINE> 2000 Offers Diverse Summer Concerts  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Teen favorites 'N Sync or Diana Ross' ersatz
Supremes? Voluble folkie Bob Dylan or foul-mouthed rapper Eminem?
Young costumed shock rockers Slipknot or retiring costumed shock
rockers Kiss?
</P>
<P>
   Music fans won't lack for choices in what's expected to be a
busy summer concert season.
</P>
<P>
   ''What you've got is the most diverse concert season in a long
time,'' said John Scher, president of Metropolitan Entertainment, a
top Northeast promoter.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the 1990s, veteran rock acts dominated the summer
touring season and some promoters worried whether young musicians
had enough appeal to take over. That doesn't seem to be a concern
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   'N Sync is selling out stadiums, and Britney Spears is doing
well, despite a controversy over how much she is actually singing
in concert. Ricky Martin and Christina Aguilera will be on the road
later in the summer, and Nickelodeon is sponsoring a package tour
featuring LFO, B Witched and others.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are more acts geared to kids,'' said industry analyst
Bob Grossweiner. ''Young teens are going to concerts for the first
time.''
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of other young acts performing in a variety of
styles. Eminem, who has ruled the charts this spring, is part of
the Up In Smoke package with Dr. Dre, Ice Cube and Snoop Dogg,
which promoters say may turn out to be one of the most successful
rap tours ever.
</P>
<P>
   Slipknot and Sevendust headline the Tattoo the Earth tour, one
of several packages in the competitive hard rock field. Green Day
and the Mighty Mighty Bosstones are among 20 punk-oriented bands
that will race through sets on the Warped Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Musicians took in a record $1.5 billion in ticket revenue last
year, the bulk during the busy summer season, according to Pollstar
magazine, an industry trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would not be surprised to see the record gross exceeded this
year,'' said Gary Bongiovanni, Pollstar editor. ''We have a healthy
economy, a lot of acts out touring and ticket prices have inched up
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Ticket prices averaged $43.63 among the 50 most popular tours
last year, a whopping $10 increase over the year before. Prices are
still going up, although not as quickly, Bongiovanni said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't had any backlash on concert ticket prices,''
Grossweiner said. ''The higher-priced tickets sell out first.
People want to be close rather than in the bleachers somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Punk rockers Blink 182 are going against the grain, selling some
of its tickets as low as $15.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to 'N Sync, the Dave Matthews Band and country
singer George Strait are playing some of the summer's biggest shows
in stadiums. The Backstreet Boys are expected late this summer or
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Metallica is headlining a brief but big tour with Korn, Kid
Rock, Powerman 5000 and System of a Down. Ozzy Osbourne's annual
Ozzfest features Godsmack, Kittie and Queens of the Stone Age. With
AC/DC rattling eardrums and Kiss headlining a farewell tour, it's a
busy hard rock summer.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the youthful competition, plenty of veteran acts are on
the road. Among the unusual events: The Who are on another comeback
tour, Jimmy Page is continuing his collaboration with the Black
Crowes, and former Beach Boy Brian Wilson is performing the band's
classic ''Pet Sounds'' album with an orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Santana, a hot ticket after his Grammy Awards sweep, is on tour
with Macy Gray. Sting, Steely Dan, Tina Turner, Don Henley, No
Doubt and Pearl Jam are on the road, and Bruce Springsteen wraps up
a yearlong reunion with the E Street Band.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the perennials, acts that seem to tour every year
but still have a big following: Dylan, the Allman Brothers Band,
the Moody Blues and Jimmy Buffett. Nostalgic fans can also hear Def
Leppard, Poison and the Go-Go's.
</P>
<P>
   Double bills that should prove popular include the Red Hot Chili
Peppers touring with the Foo Fighters, Counting Crows with Live,
and Natalie Merchant with Wilco.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts say Ross' tour is shaping up as the summer's
biggest disaster. It is suffering from spotty ticket sales and
terrible publicity, after two original Supremes refused to join
because they weren't getting paid enough.
</P>
<P>
   With Lilith Fair shut down, Grossweiner said there is a paucity
of women singers on the road.

<HEADLINE> 'Sports Night' Won't Be Back  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ''Sports Night'' has had its day.
</P>
<P>
   The producers of the sitcom canceled by ABC said they have
decided not to move it to another network despite several
''intriguing offers.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are tremendously proud of the two seasons' worth of
episodes that aired on ABC and felt committed to reviving the show
only if this creative integrity could continue,'' series creator
Aaron Sorkin and executive producer Thomas Schlamme said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   There were reports that HBO or another cable channel might pick
up the series.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sports Night,'' a behind-the-scenes look at an ESPN-style news
show, starred Peter Krause and Josh Charles as the anchormen,
Felicity Huffman as their producer and Robert Guillaume as the
boss.
</P>
<P>
   The show won more critical acclaim than viewers, unlike Sorkin's
White House drama ''The West Wing,'' which is a hit on NBC.

<P>
   Tech shares that were giving up ground included Micron
Technology, which fell $4.438 to $86.313 as traders worried that
the chip maker's earnings, due out later in the day, might fall
short of expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Mobile phone maker Nokia was also down on rumors that it was
buying telecom technology company Qualcomm. Nokia shares were off
$5.50 to $55.50, while Qualcomm's shares rose $7.25 to $71.75.
Neither company immediately returned calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Among tech bellwethers that were retreating from recent gains,
Intel was off $3 at $136 and International Business Machines was
down $2 to $112.50 Yahoo! fell $8.125 to $134.688 after an analyst
expressed concerns about the outlook for online advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into Thursday's trading, the Nasdaq index had climbed
for five straight sessions, nearly returning to where it began the
year. At its low point on May 23, the Nasdaq was down 28.6 percent
since the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Traders were also looking ahead to the Federal Reserve's regular
meeting Tuesday and Wednesday. There have been signals that the
economy has been slowing in response to the Fed's series of
interest rate increases, but investors are still bracing for the
possibility that the Fed may tighten credit further to keep
inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're seeing some profit-taking,'' said Tom Galvin, chief
equity strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Securities. ''I
think we're digesting the gains of the Nasdaq over the past four
weeks and looking ahead to the Fed meeting and the likelihood of
several earnings confessions next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Traders said there was little effect from a rumor, quickly
denied by the Fed, that the central bank's chairman, Alan
Greenspan, was in an auto accident.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by an 13-to-7margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 785.11 million
shares at late afternoon, down slightly from 791.88 million shares
as of the same time Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was off 24.80 at 1,454.33, and
the Russell 2000 index was down 5.62 at 521.99.

<HEADLINE> Castro Says Socialism Will Continue  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- President Fidel Castro said in an interview
published Thursday that he isn't worried about Cuba's transition
after he dies, because the socialist revolution will continue even
without him since he is just a ''common man.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In Cuba, there is no personality cult,'' Castro said in the
interview with Federico Mayor of Spain, the former director-general
of UNESCO, which was published in its entirety in the official
daily Granma.
</P>
<P>
   ''When a true revolution has been consolidated, and the spread
of its ideas and consciousness has begun to bear fruit, no one -- no
matter how important his personal contribution -- is
indispensable,'' Castro said.
</P>
<P>
   The 73-year-old Cuban leader has in the past endorsed his
brother, Raul Castro, as his successor. Raul Castro, 69, is the No.
2 man in both Cuba's Communist Party and the government's ruling
Council of State, as well as head of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Castro didn't mention his brother in the interview, but said the
question of succession -- the topic of endless speculation in Cuba
and abroad -- wasn't really an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't a head of state as much as a very common man,''
Castro said. ''I didn't inherit any title, nor am I king.''
</P>
<P>
   The socialist transition, he said, has been going on for more
than 40 years and will continue because there is a party ''with
much moral prestige and authority. What should I be worried
about?''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Castro also touched on a host of issues,
including the Elian Gonzalez case, the U.S. election campaign, the
problems confronting poor countries and the U.S. trade embargo
against the Caribbean island.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor interviewed Castro in January in Havana for a book he is
writing. Granma published what it said was the transcription of the
interview on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether the United States was trying to influence
Cuban politics through the trade embargo, Castro responded: ''They
didn't try to influence the revolution, but rather destroy it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate campaign in New York, Castro
said her aides sometimes give her bad advice. He noted she had said
she hoped Elian's father could be persuaded to stay in the United
States with his 6-year-old son and termed the suggestion ''a grave
and gratuitous offense'' to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why, if the revolution had been so successful, so
many Cubans had left the island, Castro blamed U.S. laws that allow
Cubans to receive residency if they reach American soil.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Mexico and the rest of Latin America and the Caribbean had
received such privileges over the past 35 years, more than half of
the population of the United States would be Latin American and
Caribbean,'' Castro said.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the interview, Castro was asked whether he would
remain a myth in death as he has been in life.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's not me,'' Castro said. ''It's the governments of the
United States that has converted me into what you call a myth, and
if I have been one in life it's also thanks to their failures to
deprive me of it (life).''

<HEADLINE> German Policeman Killed by Suspect  </HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- A man about to be handcuffed by police grabbed an
officer's weapon and opened fire Thursday, killing one policeman
and wounding another. The shooting renewed debate about German
police tactics after a gunman killed three officers last week.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-year-old policeman died at a hospital after being shot in
the stomach and liver in the western town of Walluf, 25 miles west
of Frankfurt, police said. His 44-year-old colleague, who shot the
suspect in the head, survived after emergency surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Residents had called police after seeing the 25-year-old suspect
loitering early Thursday. Police said he had put his hands on the
roof of the squad car but suddenly turned, ripped one officer's
pistol out of the holster and fired.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect was hospitalized in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, three police officers were killed and another
seriously injured in the western city of Dortmund when a driver
initially stopped for not wearing a seatbelt opened fire twice from
his car. The man later died after being found in a wooded area with
a gunshot wound to his head, an apparent suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Though unusual, the shootings raised questions about German
police rules, which emphasize ''citizen-friendly'' law enforcement
without heavy use of firearms.
</P>
<P>
   But the topic is sensitive in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone agrees that we are wary of copying American
conditions,'' Sven-Erik Wecker, a spokesman for Germany's police
union, said by telephone. ''We don't want traffic checks where the
drawn weapon is the rule, like in American movies.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said, police officers in some German states
have to buy their own bulletproof vests because local rules don't
require them, Wecker said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the vests would not have helped in the Dortmund shootings
because the gunman aimed for the police officers' heads, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''How else can you do a traffic check?'' he said. ''If we had
stopped him, drawn guns and told him to get out by megaphone,
everyone would have said: 'What kind of methods are those?'''

<HEADLINE> Senators Pitch Plan To Help Poor  </HEADLINE>
By CAREN BENJAMIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bipartisan group of senators Thursday
introduced their version of a plan to offer tax breaks and savings
incentives to neighborhoods left behind by the decade's prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   The plan mirrors one supported by President Clinton and House
Republicans but adds several elements, including a program to
encourage poor people to save money.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Clinton and House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.,
jointly announced a multibillion-dollar package of tax breaks and
other benefits to attract investments and jobs to poor areas.
</P>
<P>
   But the new plan ''is one step further and a more aggressive
approach than what the House and the president have offered,'' said
Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Penn.
</P>
<P>
   So far the bill is backed by three Senate Republicans including
Santorum and four Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''While welfare reform has had a dramatic affect on some
individuals, communities were left behind,'' Santorum said.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of both the House measure and what's likely to
become the Senate's bill are incentives like low-income housing tax
credits aimed at specific, impoverished neighborhoods and rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
   These tracts would be specified as either empowerment zones or
renewal communities and granted -- depending their designation --
somewhat different tax incentives and other perks aimed at spurring
job growth.
</P>
<P>
   Empowerment zones were enacted in 1993 but have never been fully
funded.
</P>
<P>
   Renewal communities are the House Republican's version of those
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Both plans add empowerment zones around the country. The
Senate's plan also ''beefs them up'' by fully funding the projects,
Santorum said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difference between the House bill and the senators'
is the inclusion of incentives for banks to provide individual
development accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In the senators' proposal banks would match dollar-for-dollar
the money low-income people put into one of these accounts. To
encourage banks to participate, the government would offer the
banks a tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   Money in these accounts could be spent only to pay for
education, start a small business or buy a home.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reality is that success in today's new economy is defined
less and less by how much you earn and more and more by how much
you own. This is all about expanding the winner's circle,''
Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who offered a similar proposal in his State of the
Union address, has backed the bank plan, Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   The senators' bill also expands the role of religious
organizations in federally funded community programs. Under
Clinton's plan, faith-based groups can run federally funded drug
and alcohol programs. The Senate bill would expand their role to
other charitable causes.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate plan would cost an estimated $12 billion over five
years -- as much as $7 billion more than the White House proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the additional money is to cover the savings program,
Lieberman said.

<HEADLINE> Arthritis Drugs Tested Heat-to-Head  </HEADLINE>
By PHIL GALEWITZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The results of the first head-to-head studies of
two blockbuster arthritis pain drugs -- paid for by the
pharmaceutical companies -- produced a split decision on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Merck &AMP; Co., which makes the arthritis drug Vioxx, said its pill
was better at reducing pain at night and during rest compared to
Pharmacia Corp.'s arthritis drug Celebrex.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacia countered that its studies found Vioxx was more likely
to increase high blood pressure and edema, a condition associated
with swelling in the legs. Pharmacia also said its studies found no
difference in how both drugs reduce pain.
</P>
<P>
   The companies presented the findings at a medical meeting in
Nice, France.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrex and Vioxx, both introduced last year in the United
States, are the first of a new class of painkillers to reduce pain
as well as older drugs but with the promise of less side effects
such as ulcers.
</P>
<P>
   Though Celebrex is slightly outselling Vioxx, both drugs are
expected to generate nearly $2 billion in sales in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The two drugmakers have been battling it out for the lucrative
pain drug market through heavy consumer advertising and sales calls
on doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, all the studies released on the two drugs involved
tests against placebo or older anti-inflammatory medicines.
Drugmakers rarely conduct head-to-head studies comparing their drug
to rivals because of the risk of a bad outcome.
</P>
<P>
   It unclear if the latest studies will have much of an impact on
doctor's prescribing habits, said pharmaceutical analyst Hemant
Shah of HKS &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   He said the two companies may actually be hurting themselves by
doing studies revealing faults with each other's drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Shah said the companies need to focus on showing how the drugs
are substantially better than ibuprofen and other older drugs,
which cost considerably less than the $2.42 for the daily dosage of
Celebrex and Vioxx.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ted Fields, a rheumatologist at the Hospital for Special
Surgery in New York, said earlier studies show Vioxx and Celebrex
are better than older medicines, but there's no major difference
between the two new brands. Doctors will pay close attention to
these new studies, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The studies conducted by Merck and Pharmacia each asked test
subjects to rate how well they felt after taking Celebrex or Vioxx.
</P>
<P>
   The Pharmacia study of 800 patients with osteoarthritis and high
blood pressure found that 12 percent of Vioxx patients and 6
percent of Celebrex patients developed higher blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The six-week study also found 10 percent of patients taking
Vioxx experienced edema, swelling in the legs, compared to 5
percent taking Celebrex.
</P>
<P>
   In a second Pharmacia study of 182 patients taking Celebrex and
Vioxx, investigators found no difference in how the two brand drugs
relieve pain.
</P>
<P>
   Merck's six-week study of 382 arthritis patients also found in
most measurements the drugs worked equally as well at relieving
pain. But Merck said its study found more subjects rated Vioxx
better at relieving pain during the night and during rest.
</P>
<P>
   The Merck study also found no difference between the drugs in
relieving morning stiffness or pain walking on a flat surface.
</P>
<P>
   In trading Thursday, shares of Merck fell 93.75 cents to $71.50,
and Pharmacia slipped $3.25 to $52.125, both on the New York Stock
Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Colombia's Top Cop Laments Drug War  </HEADLINE>
By JARED KOTLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- The words were surprising, coming from
the hard-nosed general who has for years been Washington's trusted
point man in the war on drugs in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Even more so, as legislation advances in the U.S. Congress to
give this Andean nation about $1 billion more in counternarcotics
funds, most of it for military training and hardware.
</P>
<P>
   During a two-hour interview Wednesday with The Associated Press,
national police chief Gen. Rosso Jose Serrano said international
counter-drug efforts should focus as much on stemming drug abuse in
the United States and Europe as destroying drug laboratories and
crops in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Just such an effort to divert funds to domestic drug treatment
programs was rejected by the Senate on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd rather see drug consumption drop than get any of this
aid,'' said Serrano, 57, who turns in his badge Friday after 5&AMP;frac12;
years heading one of the world's most embattled police forces.
</P>
<P>
   ''If consumption were seriously reduced,'' he added, ''this
country could go back to what it once was, a place that grew
coffee, where people worked hard and sweated for a paycheck.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Colombia is a nation with a deepening guerrilla
conflict, spiraling drug production, and whose wealthy are taking
their families and money abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In a wood-paneled office in the intelligence headquarters he
calls his ''little CIA,'' the man U.S. officials herald as one of
the drug war's greatest heroes reflected frankly on that struggle's
limitations.
</P>
<P>
   Serrano showed a sensitive, contemplative side rarely seen
during a career that brought him fame, national devotion -- and
little semblance of a normal life.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't been out to a movie theater in 10 years,'' said
Serrano, joking and looking relaxed in a smart gray suit -- a switch
from his usual green uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Serrano even acknowledged a curiosity about the cocaine he's
dedicated his life to eliminating. ''I've thought why don't I snort
some myself, if it makes you feel so great?''
</P>
<P>
   The general is stepping down just as Washington embarks on a new
-- some say perilous -- phase in efforts to stem the flow of drugs
from this nation that produces 90 percent of the world's cocaine
and a growing share of its heroin.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. funds would finance a Colombian military push into
rebel-held southern jungles, paving the way for stepped-up efforts
to fumigate drug crops and destroy laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Serrano, who initiated aerial crop destruction as chief of the
police anti-narcotics division in the early 1990s, says he welcomes
the U.S. aid package because it will send a tough message to drug
traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   But he cautions that the U.S. assistance may serve only to drive
traffickers to neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
   While faithfully implementing the U.S-inspired fumigation
policy, Serrano sees his main accomplishments elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Serrano purged the police of more than 11,000 corrupt officers
and in 1995 dismantled the Cali cocaine cartel, which had corrupted
Colombia's political class to the core.
</P>
<P>
   While failing to dent the outflow of cocaine and heroin, the
Cali cartel's downfall sent drug mafiosos underground, and
splintered the trade into smaller less violent gangs.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Serrano came through again, arresting 30 suspected
members of a major cocaine gang wanted by U.S. authorities. Serrano
said he was up all night before Operation Millennium, nervously
watching television in bed, concerned his men would fail to capture
key ''narcos'' already named in news releases drafted in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The general readily credits the CIA and U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration for intelligence, training and money critical to
many successful operations. DEA and CIA agents were usually by his
side in the most high-profile arrests, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Serrano's critics say he put the U.S. counterdrug agenda above
Colombia's critical need for more street cops and a push to combat
the world's highest kidnapping rate. He admits that rural Colombia
has become more lawless.
</P>
<P>
   Politics may well be in Serrano's future, but he says all he
wants now is a long vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to take a bit of a break from drug-trafficking, deaths
and so much pressure. I don't want to abuse my good luck,'' he
said.

   IRVINE, Ky. (AP) -- Backstreet Boy Kevin Richardson is officially
off the market.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old singer married longtime girlfriend Kristin
Willits on Saturday, his brother Tim Richardson confirmed

<P>
   Tim, a minister, performed the ceremony at a church camp once

</P>
<P>
   Among the 150 to 200 friends and relatives who attended were
cousin and Backstreet Boy Brian Littrell, who announced his own
engagement earlier this year, and the three other members of the

<HEADLINE> Film Features Mellencamp As Actor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- The low-budget film ''After Image'' will
feature John Mellencamp -- as an actor only.
</P>
<P>
   The rocker's songs won't be used for the movie score, which is
being composed by former Rochester resident Richard Tuttobene.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the movie is a mostly Rochester affair. Most of the
filming, which ended Wednesday, was done in the city, and the film
is directed by Bob Manganelli, a 1983 graduate of Rochester
Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wouldn't have been possible to do this film in New York or
Los Angeles for $1.4 million,'' publicist Angelo Mancuso told the
Rochester Democrat and Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Mellencamp plays a disillusioned police photographer returning
to Rochester to live with his aunt. He falls in love with a woman
whose psychic powers soon entangle them with an ominous killer.

<HEADLINE> Study Finds Gonorrhea Rates on Rise  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID PITT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Gonorrhea climbed 9 percent in the United States
in 1998 after 12 straight years of decline, the government reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Debra Mosure, an epidemiologist with the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, speculated that the safe-sex practices that
were adopted because of AIDS are being abandoned because of the
introduction of more effective drugs against the virus.
</P>
<P>
   ''There does seem to be some real increases in the overall
number of gonorrhea cases due to unsafe sexual behavior,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some states said improved testing was partly responsible for the
increase in reported cases.
</P>
<P>
   A 50-state CDC survey found a 9 percent increase in the rate of
gonorrhea -- from 121.8 cases per 100,000 people in 1997 to 132.9
per 100,000 in 1998. The rate had fallen 64.2 percent from 1985 to
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Many states saw increases in gonorrhea among gay and bisexual
men.
</P>
<P>
   The sexually transmitted disease can cause pelvic inflammation
and infertility in women, and can also foster the transmission of
the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   The Midwest had the highest increase of any region -- 16.4
percent. The Northeast was the only region to show a decrease -- 0.8
percent. The South showed an increase of 8.7 percent and the West
an increase of 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The highest gonorrhea rate was in Mississippi, with 391.5 cases
per 100,000 people. The lowest was in Maine, with 5.4 cases per
100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC said preliminary data from 1999 may show gonorrhea rates
declining again.

<HEADLINE> Senate Dems End Worker Safety Delay  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Democrats blocked a Republican attempt
Thursday to delay for one year proposed Clinton administration
rules giving workers new protections against repetitive motion
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats refused to go along with a GOP effort to deny money
for the program throughout fiscal 2001, which would effectively
postpone the rules until October of next year. Democrats said that
could deny help for an estimated 1.8 million workers who suffer
from ergonomic injuries each year.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a lot of men and women who are in pain and who struggle
because of these workplace injuries,'' said Sen. Paul Wellstone,
D-Minn. ''We ought to provide some protection.''
</P>
<P>
   The action Thursday prevented Republicans, at least for now,
from attaching the delaying amendment to the annual spending bill
that covers the departments of labor, education, health and human
services. Republicans eventually could prevail, and the House voted
earlier this month for a similar delay.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not the end of the trail,'' said Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. ''We're looking for a reasonable way to
get this done.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rules, made public in November after a decade of
study and delay, would require employers to minimize everyday
physical stresses of a broad range of jobs. Final standards are now
scheduled to be released by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA estimates the rules would cost businesses $4.7 billion to
implement, but predicts net savings of $9 billion in medical costs
and increased productivity. Republicans say that figure is wrong,
pointing to Small Business Administration estimates of $60 billion
a year or more.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the largest, most onerous and expensive rule in the
history of this agency,'' said Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo. ''This rule
has serious, substantial flaws.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also argued that the rules are not based on sound
science, that they could usurp state worker compensation laws and
that they could jeopardize the quality of health care provided for
Medicare and Medicaid recipients.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want a regulation going into effect in December
without us having additional time to consider it,'' said Sen. Don
Nickles, R-Okla.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Eyes Partial Congo Pullout  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) -- Ten days after Rwandan forces handed it
an embarrassing military setback in northern Congo, Uganda said
Thursday it was withdrawing five battalions from the divided
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential spokeswoman Hope Kivengere said U.N. observers were
supervising the withdrawal of Ugandan troops around the Congo River
port of Kisangani, where hundreds were killed in fighting between
Rwandan and Ugandan forces this month.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda and Uganda sent thousands of forces to Africa's
third-largest nation in support of rival rebel forces opposed to
Congolese President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   At least 518 people, including 319 Congolese civilians, were
killed in the weeklong fighting in Kisangani, the International
Committee of the Red Cross said.
</P>
<P>
   In her statement, Kivengere did not mention the fighting, saying
the Ugandan pullout was ''part of the United Nations
demilitarization plan for that zone.''
</P>
<P>
   James Wapakabulo, a top official in Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni's National Resistance Movement, said the pullout was made
possible by the U.N. presence and would be completed within two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Uganda's involvement in the Congo's civil war has grown
unpopular, and Kivengeri's announcement came one week before
Ugandans vote whether to keep the Museveni-backed ''no-party''
system or return to multiparty politics.
</P>
<P>
   It also came one day after Uganda's Parliament passed a
resolution urging the government to heed a regional peace deal and
withdraw Ugandan troops from Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers also approved resolution requiring monthly briefings
from the government on its progress in implementing the accord, the
government-owned New Vision reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The accord was signed in July and August in Lusaka, Zambia, by
Congo and its backers, Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia, as well as by
Uganda and Rwanda and their rebel allies.
</P>
<P>
   Under the pact, 5,537 U.N. observers are to be stationed in
Congo to supervise a cease-fire and the withdrawal of foreign
forces. So far, only 100 U.N. personnel have been deployed.
</P>
<P>
   During Wednesday's debate, legislators also asked the U.N. and
the international community to honor their obligations spelled out
in the Lusaka accord, the New Vision reported.
</P>
<P>
   However, it rejected a draft resolution urging the government to
utilize all official channels to promote a peaceful relationship
with Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   Already, U.N. officials have worried that the proxy war may
again erupt between the two rebel factions, each backed by Rwanda
and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   The Ugandan-backed Congolese Liberation Movement, which has
fought alongside the Ugandan army in Kisangani, has said it would
base itself in the city.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Voting Focuses on Mugabe  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- This weekend's parliamentary elections
throw the spotlight on one man who's not even on the ballot --
Zimbabwe's longtime leader Robert Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
   To most voters, the polls are about whether Mugabe, the
autocratic president who has ruled this country since independence,
remains unchallenged or is forced to loosen his 20-year grip on
power.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe already has suffered one stunning defeat at the polls
this year, when voters in February rejected proposed constitutional
revisions that would have further entrenched his powers.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Mugabe, 76, has worked desperately to save his
ruling party from electoral defeat -- no matter what the cost to his
country, said John Makumbe, a political science professor at the
University of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is driven by desperation,'' Makumbe said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the referendum defeat, armed ruling party militants
began occupying the first of an eventual 1,600 white-owned
commercial farms, disrupting planting and harvesting in this
agriculturally dependent country. Mugabe has encouraged the
occupations, promising to redistribute white-owned farms to
hundreds of thousands of landless blacks -- after the election.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe also has made vague promises to give at least some
control of white-owned businesses to blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is a consummate politician who has seized on populist
issues without any regard for how he will deliver on his
promises,'' said Alfred Nhema, head of the political studies
department at the University of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   These promises, together with widespread violence against
opposition supporters and Mugabe's virulent criticism of the former
colonial ruler, Britain, have scared financial markets and shut off
loans and investment.
</P>
<P>
   Hard currency reserves -- heavily dependent on withering tobacco
sales and tourism dollars -- have dried up, causing acute shortages
of gasoline and kerosene.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mugabe calculates this will be a short, turbulent period that
will pass once the election is won,'' Nhema said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the economic turbulence has given rise to the
rapid growth of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change, the
first serious threat to Mugabe's rule.
</P>
<P>
   A poll published last week showed the opposition party could win
70 of the 120 seats at stake in the parliamentary election. That
would be a near-revolution in a country where Mugabe's Zimbabwe
African National Union Patriotic Front held 147 of the 150 seats in
the last parliament.
</P>
<P>
   But with Mugabe appointing 30 parliament members, the opposition
needs at least 76 seats to have a majority and press ahead with its
goal of forcing Mugabe to retire before his term ends in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe's party has expressed confidence that it will maintain a
large majority.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe, who was jailed for a decade by the former white-minority
government of Rhodesia, was hailed as a freedom fighter and symbol
of African liberation for leading the country, renamed Zimbabwe, to
independence in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Once in power, though, Mugabe failed to clamp down on government
corruption and thrived as the head of a ruling elite, few of whom
dared challenge him, Makumbe said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he has sacrificed whatever remains of his heroic reputation
because of his fear of losing power, Makumbe said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He would never have behaved like this two or three years
ago,'' Makumbe said.
</P>
<P>
   John Nkomo, chairman of the ruling party, acknowledged that
Mugabe, an ascetic former school teacher, has few friends, has
groomed no heir apparent in the party and maintains a haughty,
distant manner with his subordinates.
</P>
<P>
   But he is a strong man, who rules his country with ''principled
leadership,'' Nkomo said.
</P>
<P>
   That leadership has not inspired loyalty in Mugabe's party,
Nhema said. If it fares poorly in the elections, some government
ministers and party officials may be prepared to dump their leader,
Nhema said.
</P>
<P>
   ''In our politics, there are no permanent friends, only
permanent interests,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Keeps Plane Contract Plan  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon announced Thursday it will stick
to its winner-take-all approach in awarding the largest weapon
contract in history -- $200 billion to build a next-generation
fighter plane -- to either Boeing Co. or Lockheed Martin Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon had been studying the possibility of altering its
approach so that both the winner and loser would have a hand in
producing the aircraft, known as the Joint Strike Fighter. Some
analysts believe the loser essentially may be finished as a fighter
aircraft manufacturer because there is no other new fighter on the
drawing board.
</P>
<P>
   Both Seattle-based Boeing and Lockheed Martin, based in
Bethesda, Md., have built prototypes of their aircraft and soon
will begin flying them. If the current schedule holds, the winner
of the design competition will be announced in the spring, when a
new administration is in place.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Pentagon's approach, the winner of the design
competition will build all the planes. An alternative was to have
the winner and loser share in the manufacturing, on the theory this
would keep both in business and would mitigate against a sole
producer inflating its production costs.
</P>
<P>
   The winner-take-all approach ''seems to make the most sense to
us,'' Jacques Gansler, the Pentagon's technology chief, said at a
news conference. He announced that Defense Secretary William Cohen
had written Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., explaining the importance
and future direction of the project.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to Lewis, chairman of the House Appropriations
subcommittee on defense, Cohen sounded less explicit than Gansler
about the Pentagon's intentions on the question of maintaining
competition in Joint Strike Fighter production. Cohen noted that
the Pentagon has considered a number of options, all based on a
single aircraft design. One option is for the winner to share
production with the loser.
</P>
<P>
   ''Each option we have studied offers potential benefits and
drawbacks, both tangible and intangible,'' Cohen wrote. ''We will
continue to evaluate these options and to develop a comprehensive
assessment that our successors can use as they make decisions on
the future course of the JSF program.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said he asked the Rand Corp., a think tank associated with
the Defense Department, to review options and to report back by
Dec. 1. Gansler said the Rand study will be an ''independent
assessment'' of whether to stick to the winner-take-all approach --
''to make sure we're doing the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the Pentagon plans to issue a formal
solicitation for industry proposals for JSF design in September,
Gansler said.
</P>
<P>
   The Joint Strike Fighter is intended to provide the Air Force a
replacement for its current fleet of F-16 fighters, as well as
replacements for the Marine Corps' AV-8B Harrier jets and Navy and
Marine Corps F/A-18s. At least 3,000 aircraft are to be built, at
an average projected cost of $30-$35 million apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Some in Congress recently have questioned the direction of the
program and have proposed cutting its funds.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to Lewis, Cohen called the Joint Strike Fighter
critically important to the modernization of the U.S. military and
''the cornerstone of tactical aircraft modernization.'' He said it
was the ''only affordable solution'' to the problem of maintaining
superior warplanes through the first half of the 21st century.

<HEADLINE> Objections Raised Over War Memorial  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- A group of 707 Japanese-Americans asked Interior
Secretary Bruce Babbitt on Thursday to eliminate a disputed
Japanese-American creed to be carved on a World War II memorial
under construction near the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   A petition was presented to John Parsons, associate regional
director of the National Park Service, which has approved the
monument. Sponsors of the petition said he promised to brief
Babbitt and then issue a response.
</P>
<P>
   The group said it would agree to eliminate all names and
quotations from the monument.
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand that concerns have been raised,'' said Cherry
Tsutsumida, executive secretary of the National Japanese American
Memorial Foundation, ''but these are issues that have been raised
repeatedly with the board and an overwhelming group has approved
the memorial.''
</P>
<P>
   The monument, due to be dedicated in November, commemorates both
Japanese-Americans who served in U.S. forces and more than 100,000
civilians from the west coast who were interned in camps during the
war.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are significant areas of concern about the
inscriptions,'' the petition said, ''including inaccuracies,
misrepresentations, gender biases, and exclusion of diverse
perspectives.''
</P>
<P>
   The group particularly objected to the creed written by the late
Mike Matsuoka, whom it identified as field secretary of the
Japanese-American Citizens League (JACL) during the war.
</P>
<P>
   ''He and JACL strongly advocated 'constructive cooperation' with
the U.S. government, even if it meant massive violations of human,
civil and constitutional rights,'' the petition said.
</P>
<P>
   The internment, approved by the Supreme Court as a war measure,
has since been repudiated by successive presidents. Congress has
voted compensation to the internees.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Lott See July China Vote  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Both President Clinton and Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott expressed optimism Thursday that the Senate would
vote on granting permanent normal trade relations to China next
month.
</P>
<P>
   But a possible amendment by Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., setting
up a procedure for U.S. sanctions against China for weapons
proliferation, could frustrate meeting such a timetable.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors of the China trade bill are hoping to keep further
amendments off the landmark legislation so it does not have to go
back to the House for another vote.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike most amendments proposed so far, which have little
apparent support, Thompson's measure has significant backing among
Senate conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Clinton administration and Republican supporters of
the China trade bill have been unable to persuade Thompson not to
press his proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson has said he wants a separate Senate vote on his
legislation at about the same time the China trade bill is debated
-- or he'll press it as an amendment.
</P>
<P>
   That has prompted others with amendments to demand that they,
too, get separate votes. It's causing a potential procedural
nightmare for Senate leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson announced on Thursday he had signed up two new
co-sponsors for his bill -- Lott and Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont. --
bringing the number of sponsors to 15.
</P>
<P>
   Lott's signing on was not viewed as an encouraging sign by China
trade bill advocates.
</P>
<P>
   But Lott told reporters on Thursday, ''There are a lot of us
that are concerned about Chinese nuclear weapon proliferation (and
who) are not going to be inclined to vote against an amendment
dealing with the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lott said, ''It is clearly my intent to call it up before
the August recess,'' although adding, ''It might not be as easy
done as said.''
</P>
<P>
   In a Senate speech, Thompson said that China over the past
several years had assisted missile programs in North Korea, Libya,
Iran and possibly Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot turn a blind eye to these factors as we consider
(China trade),'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Clinton told reporters that he and Lott had
talked earlier in the week by phone and ''I believe we have an
agreement'' for a vote in July.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously I wish we could have voted on it before the 4th of
July recess,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I met with a group of senators (Wednesday), a bipartisan
group, and will continue to work it hard. But I think we're on
schedule now for a timely vote,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which passed the House in May after over fierce
objections by organized labor, would end annual congressional
reviews of China's trade status and grant it the same permanent
benefits that nearly all other U.S. trading partners receive.
</P>
<P>
   It would also permit U.S. companies to take full advantage of
the market-opening steps taken by China as part of its upcoming
entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The China trade bills are H.R. 4444 and S. 2277.

<HEADLINE> Europe Wants Its Say on Missiles  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The European allies in NATO expect President
Clinton to weigh their reservations about a U.S. national missile
defense before he decides whether to begin building it, NATO's top
diplomat said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've accepted the president's assurances that ... the views
of the allies will be a crucial ingredient in any decision he makes
later this year,'' Lord Robertson, the NATO secretary-general, told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon is developing an anti-missile system -- a
combination of ground-based interceptor rockets, powerful radars
and high-speed computers -- capable of shooting down a small number
of long-range ballistic missiles aimed at any part of the United
States. It would not provide any protection for Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The administration says Clinton will make a decision by fall on
whether to begin construction of a radar in Alaska that would be
one of the centerpieces of the anti-missile system. Clinton has
said he would first consider the project's cost, the probability
that it would work in a crisis, its effect on arms control and the
seriousness of the missile threat from such ''rogue nations'' as
North Korea, Iran and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson acknowledged that some NATO members, including France
and Germany, have publicly aired their concerns about the U.S. plan
for an anti-missile system that would defend U.S. territory but not
Europe. But Robertson insisted that the issue is not so divisive as
to harm relations within the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson met later with Defense Secretary William Cohen at the
Pentagon. Cohen spokesman Kenneth Bacon said missile defense was
expected to be a topic of their discussion. He said Cohen shares
Robertson's view that the United States should hear out Russian
officials on their missile defense ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would like to sit down and talk with the Russians and, as I
said last week, we've actually made proposals to them as to a
specific date'' next week, Bacon said. He was not sure whether the
Russians have accepted the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said a recent proposal by Russia to join with Europe
in developing missile defenses may be a ploy to divide the European
allies from America. But he emphasized that it is too early to know
because the Russians have not yet spelled out what kind of
anti-missile system they have in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has only been outlined in the sketchiest possible form,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials are scheduled to meet with the Russians next week
to hear the details.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen has said he is concerned that the Russians may be
primarily interested in driving a wedge between Washington and its
European allies, given the doubts some European leaders already
have about the U.S. anti-missile plan.

<HEADLINE> Opponents Want Missile Test Inquiry  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than 50 House Democrats urged the FBI on
Thursday to investigate ''serious allegations of fraud and
cover-up'' in development of a national missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force general in charge of developing the system, Lt.
Gen. Ronald Kadish, denied any deception and told Congress such
allegations already have been disproved.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, meanwhile, said he is ''not
going to be outraged'' if President Clinton leaves a decision on
the system to the next president.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans have been pushing for Clinton to give
the go-ahead this year for a system to protect all 50 states from
limited nuclear missile attack. Lott is the first high-ranking
Republican to suggest that a delay might be acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Support for the system has been mixed among Democrats, with
opponents citing recent reports questioning whether the planned
system of interceptor missiles would work and whether the Pentagon
is objectively weighing test results.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we're relying on this technology to protect the United
States and the technology is being advanced with false information,
the people have a right to know,'' said Rep. Dennis Kucinich,
D-Ohio, holding up a black umbrella full of gaping holes.
</P>
<P>
   Kucinich appeared at a news conference on the Capitol lawn with
several other Democratic members and with physicist Robert L. Park,
who said the limited testing conducted by the Pentagon is
inadequate to ensure a viable system.
</P>
<P>
   Park said scientists with the American Physical Society strongly
support an FBI inquiry into whether any tests have been rigged to
succeed or had data withheld.
</P>
<P>
   At a House hearing Thursday, Kadish strongly defended test
procedures and the development of a system he said is essential to
defending against intentional or accidental nuclear missile attack.
Allegations of fraudulent testing have been made since 1996 and
have been taken seriously with no evidence of deception, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kadish said the system would not protect against any massive
attack.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will not be perfect against every conceivable
countermeasure, but neither will our adversaries be perfect against
our capabilities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kadish acknowledged that a significant setback in any element of
the system could delay the entire program, designed for deployment
by 2005 at a cost expected to exceed $36 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Defense Secretary William Cohen indicated he
might recommend going ahead with the system even if a July 7 test
fails. The test involves a missile collision over the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-three Democrats signed the letter to FBI Director Louis
Freeh. The letter cited concerns of scientists from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and alleged a cover-up of a
failed experiment of the system.
</P>
<P>
   ''Public scrutiny of the evidence for these allegations has
recently been greatly impeded by the decision of the Department of
Defense to classify that letter and attachments,'' the
congressional letter said.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats quoted from a New York Times report on the
scientists' letter which said the system could not tell the
difference between warheads and decoys.
</P>
<P>
   ''The American people need an independent investigation of this
matter to determine if the well-documented and serious allegations
of fraud in the National Missile Defense system are true and if a
cover-up of that fraud has taken place,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, R-Miss, said he expected Clinton to delay a decision
''because he doesn't want it to cause problems for Al Gore.'' But
such a delay would be ''only a few months ... so I'm not going to
be outraged if he dodges this decision.''
</P>
<P>
   While Lott said he generally would like to see a decision as
soon as possible, one coming from ''hopefully future President
George W. Bush has some attractiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has backed a much more ambitious anti-missile shield than
the administration is currently considering.

<HEADLINE> US Asks Zimbabwe To Curb Violence  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department asked the government of
Zimbabwe Thursday to discourage violence in the election campaign
that has already claimed more than 30 lives.
</P>
<P>
   The department was still trying to get a delegation of election
observers accredited despite the Zimbabwe government's insistence
on limiting the number of foreigners allowed, said State Department
spokesman Philip T. Reeker.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really believe it's very important to the democratic
process that all Zimbabweans feel safe when they exercise their
democratic rights this weekend,'' Reeker said of the
violence-plagued campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He said the government and President Robert Mugabe ''have
special obligations, as the leaders of the country, to ensure that
they contribute to a secure and transparent atmosphere'' for this
weekend's parliamentary vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''So we're calling upon them to fulfill those responsibilities;
actively discourage violence, intimidation or other efforts to
disrupt the elections,'' Reeker said.
</P>
<P>
   At least 31 people, mostly opposition supporters, have died in
political violence since February, when ruling party militants and
war veterans began illegally occupying more than 1,400 white-owned
farms.
</P>
<P>
   Without giving details, Reeker also said he had noted ''some
strong rhetoric recently from Zimbabwe which seemed to encourage
violence'' and said the United States deplored such rhetoric ''no
matter which party is responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We strongly urge the leaders of all the parties in Zimbabwe to
refrain from violent rhetoric,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reeker also said the United States still hoped the government
would accredit a delegation from the U.S. Embassy in Harare, the
capital, and others to serve as observers in the vote Saturday and
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The government has approved a few hundred international
observers but banned others, including diplomats already serving in
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't recall any recent elections in which a government has
taken this position and we are very disappointed that the
government of Zimbabwe has decided to take this position which will
undermine the credibility of their election,'' Reeker said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pressures House on Tobacco  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton pressured the House on
Thursday to give the Justice Department enough money to pursue its
huge lawsuit against the tobacco industry. ''Let the American
people have their day in court,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   Just days after the House voted to block some funds for the suit
and then abruptly reversed itself, lawmakers prepared to revisit
the issue, which carries enormous financial stakes. Federal
officials said the suit could recover as much as the $246 billion
settlement the states reached with cigarette makers.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., was trying to ease legislation that
would forbid the Justice Department from accepting $12 million from
other agencies to help pay its legal costs. Attorney General Janet
Reno has said that without that money, the department could not
afford the suit and would have to drop it.
</P>
<P>
   The government wants to recover costs, estimated to exceed $20
billion annually, that it says it has incurred treating
smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   But before House debate began Thursday, Clinton attacked the
cigarette industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''The tobacco companies and their powerful allies in Congress
are working overtime to pass special protections to shield them
from financial responsibility for the harm they've caused,''
Clinton said as he left the White House on a Western trip.
</P>
<P>
   ''So again I ask Congress, just let the American people have
their day in court. The legal responsibility of the tobacco
companies should be decided by a judicial process, not by the
political process.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents said Clinton's remarks and Waxman's amendment were an
election-year effort against an unpopular target.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is just absolutely a disingenuous way to reach a
political goal for Henry Waxman and the Clinton administration,''
Rep. Robin Hayes, R-N.C., said in an interview. He said their goal
is ''to destroy, to eliminate, to wipe off the radar screen the
tobacco industry, farmers and everyone connected with the
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue was legislation that would prohibit the Justice
Department from accepting money from other agencies to defray the
cost of suits filed by the department. Waxman was trying to amend
the language to exempt suits filed by last Jan. 1, which would let
the tobacco lawsuit continue.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's legal bills for the suit are expected
to hit $40 million for 2000 and 2001 alone. The department wants
the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Health and Human Services, and
Defense to contribute $4 million each next year to help pay the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, the House voted 207-197 to prohibit the Justice
Department from accepting $4 million from veterans medical care
programs. The next day, the House, by voice vote, let the $4
million come instead from the Department of Veterans Affairs'
general operating budget.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco fight came as the House worked through a $35.5
billion measure financing the Departments of Justice, Commerce and
State. The Senate has not written its version of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has threatened to veto the measure because of
its tobacco language and because it would cut Clinton proposals for
hiring local gun-crime prosecutors and police officers, legal aid
for the poor, high-technology incentives for industry, and payments
for U.N. peacekeeping missions.
</P>
<P>
   In early action, the House voted by voice to more than double
the $141 million the bill had provided for the Legal Services
Corp., which provides legal help for low-income people.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers added $134 million to bring the agency, a favorite
target of many Republicans, to $275 million. That is still $30
million below this year's level and $65 million less than Clinton's
request.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the House voted 373-50 to approve a $1.9 billion
measure financing Congress' own operations. The vote came after
lawmakers added $96 million to head off cuts in legislators' aides
and Capitol police an earlier version would have forced.
</P>
<P>
   They also voted 235-184 to reject a conservative effort led by
Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., that would have automatically steered cuts
in spending bills to debt reduction. Currently, they are usually
used for other programs in the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill number is H.R. 4690.

<HEADLINE> Education Dept: Schools Overcrowded  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Parents in Murfreesboro, Tenn., don't need a
study to tell them their schools are overcrowded.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are about 15 portables in the school yard; kids are
eating in the hallway, sitting cross-legged on the floor,'' said
Stacey Borasky, a parent who led the charge for a new school to
ease conditions at Walter Hill Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   The school is swelling with 1,096 K-8 pupils -- nearly 200 more
than were enrolled seven years ago. ''It's an unhealthy
environment,'' Borasky said. ''We pack them into the building like
sardines.''
</P>
<P>
   More than one-fifth of the nation's schools have more students
than they were built to serve, the Education Department said
Thursday in a report suggesting that overcrowding and crumbling
buildings go hand in hand.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, the study said, 17,400 U.S. schoolhouses (or 22
percent) were at least 6 percent over capacity, which the
department deems overcrowded. Two-thirds of these schools, which
enroll nearly 18 million children, had roofs, plumbing and other
building features that needed constant maintenance, violated
building codes, or required outright replacement, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   The report was released as President Clinton pushed for
congressional approval of his $1.3 billion emergency school-repair
bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rising enrollments and years of deferred maintenance have
taken a serious toll, jeopardizing our children's health and the
quality of their education,'' Clinton said as the Senate opened
debate on fiscal 2001 education spending.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans oppose Clinton's wish to set aside grants and loans
to fix 5,000 of the worst schools each year. They plan, instead, to
put the construction money into a pot with other programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Parents have a right to expect that their children go to
schools that are in good condition,'' said Education Secretary
Richard Riley, saying that although school repair is a local issue,
voters support the federal help.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who heads the Appropriations
Committee's panel that oversees education spending, said, ''We're
prepared to take to the American people the basic concept that if
school systems do not need additional buildings, they ought to be
able to use their share for something else.''
</P>
<P>
   The spending fight has focused on overall school repair: leaking
roofs, flooding toilets and collapsing walls that have dogged
districts saddled with schoolhouses averaging 40 years old. But
Thursday's report documented a trend that paralleled the aging of
schools: record public school enrollment overcrowding and
increasing wear and tear on buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The report said:
</P>
<P>
   --53 percent of overcrowded schools reported problems with
heating and other ventilation systems, compared with 39 percent of
schools with normal capacity.
</P>
<P>
   --36 percent of all schools used portable classroom trailers.
</P>
<P>
   --20 percent of all schools held classes elsewhere such as in the
gym or the lunchroom.
</P>
<P>
   --8 percent of all schools -- 6,200 buildings -- were severely
overcrowded, enrolling 25 percent more children than they were
built to hold.
</P>
<P>
   The first-ever survey asked 903 public schools last year about
building space and the condition of roofs, plumbing, heating,
ventilation and other features. The margin of error for all schools
was plus or minus 0.9 of a percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   Overcrowded schools were typically large elementary schools in
poor, minority neighborhoods in the South and West, the report
said.

<HEADLINE> Panel Endorses Interior Dept. Plan  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- To avoid a veto showdown on federal park and
forest spending, a Senate panel endorsed a $15.5 billion funding
plan for the Interior Department and other land and cultural
agencies Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Appropriations Committee sent the Interior bill to
the Senate floor without amendments loosening environmental
restrictions that have prompted vetoes and gridlock in recent
years. The measure is nearly $1 billion less than President Clinton
sought but $900 million more than the House approved.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to back away from any reasonable amendments, but
I'm not going to let the whole bill get hung up on any single one
of them,'' said Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, meanwhile, said he would try to block
spending on Clinton's plan to protect roadless areas in national
forests until an independent panel studies it. The plan would ban
road building and other development in 43 million acres of remote
forests.
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand the desire to avoid a veto, but on occasion I
think it's time this president owned up to very sloppy policy
making. And if it takes a veto ... then I guess it would be
necessary,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   The panel reluctantly agreed to a proposal by Sen. Byron Dorgan,
D-N.D., to add nearly $1.9 million in funding for 31 American
Indian tribal colleges.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate measure includes increases in several areas sought by
Clinton, such as rebuilding Indian reservation schools, funding for
the National Endowment for the Arts and buying state and federal
park land.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had requested $470 million to buy new park land. The
Senate plan of $221 million was more than the House included.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate plan also includes $105 million for the NEA, $7.4
million more than this year's budget but $45 million less than
Clinton sought. The House version would provide no increase.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Slip on Technology Retreat  </HEADLINE>
By SETH SUTEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq ran out of gas Thursday, cutting
short a five-day winning streak that had brought the average above
one important milestone -- 4,000 points -- and nearly above another,
where it began the year.
</P>
<P>
   A hearty selloff in technology stocks was to blame as investors
locked in profits following a weeks-long runup in major bellwethers
such as Oracle and Intel. The Nasdaq composite index fell 127.17,
or 3.1 percent, to 3,936.84.
</P>
<P>
   The damage was less severe in the Dow Jones industrial average,
which fell 121.62, or 1.2 percent, to close at 10,376.12.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq had breached the 4,000-point barrier on Tuesday for
the first time in more than two months. But selling in technology
shares Thursday spread to other sectors, bringing the overall
market lower.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're looking at some profit-taking in that sector, which has
been very strong,'' said Barry Hyman, senior equity analyst at
Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. ''It looks like the big techs that ran
up are giving up some ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest losers included Micron Technology, which fell $5.75
to $85 as traders worried that the chip maker's earnings, due after
the close of trading, might fall short of expectations. The
earnings report actually beat analysts' estimates, however.
</P>
<P>
   Several tech bellwethers gave up some recently won ground,
including Intel, off $4.938 at $134.063; Oracle, down $4.688 at
$81.50; and Cisco Systems, off $2.875 at $64.563. Yahoo! fell
$11.125 to $131.688 after an analyst expressed concerns about the
outlook for online advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Mobile phone maker Nokia was also down on rumors that it was
buying telecom technology company Qualcomm. Nokia shares were off
$4.75 to $56.25, while Qualcomm's shares rose $3.758 to $68.25.
Neither company returned calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into Thursday's trading, the Nasdaq index had climbed
for five straight sessions. The Nasdaq, which was close to breaking
even for the year on Wednesday, remained below its Dec. 31, 1999,
finish of 4,069.31. But it has come back from its low point on May
23, when the Nasdaq was down 28.6 percent from the end of last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Traders were also looking ahead to the Federal Reserve's regular
meeting Tuesday and Wednesday. There have been signals that the
economy has been slowing in response to the Fed's series of
interest rate increases, but investors are still bracing for the
possibility that the Fed may tighten credit further to keep
inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we're digesting the gains of the Nasdaq over the past
four weeks and looking ahead to the Fed meeting and the likelihood
of several earnings confessions next week,'' said Tom Galvin, chief
equity strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said there was little effect from a rumor, quickly
denied by the Fed, that the central bank's chairman, Alan
Greenspan, was in an auto accident.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by an 11-to-6 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.01 billion
shares as of the 4 p.m. EDT close of the Big Board, down slightly
from 996.69 million shares Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was off 26.88 at 1,452.28, and
the Russell 2000 index was down 12.59 at 515.02.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.6 percent.
Germany's DAX index fell 0.7 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was down
1.0 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 0.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> Hastert Presents Whistle Compromise  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER LOVEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The toot of a train whistle isn't quaint to
folks in the Chicago suburbs, who have rallied House Speaker Dennis
Hastert and other lawmakers to fight a pending federal requirement
that trains blow their horns day and night at certain railroad
crossings.
</P>
<P>
   Several members of Congress gave Federal Railroad Administration
chief Jolene Molitoris a bipartisan plan that seeks to address
citizens' concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ''There needs to be a common-sense approach, so that we can
guarantee a reliability of safety and not have continuous
whistle-blowing,'' Hastert said after Thursday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The FRA's proposal, required by Congress in a 1994 law, would
most affect 2,058 railroad crossings across America where
whistle-blowing now is banned.
</P>
<P>
   Of those, 899 are in Illinois, the vast majority in towns
ringing Chicago. Wisconsin has 204, followed by Minnesota, Indiana
and Virginia, according to the FRA.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would supersede local ''whistle bans'' requiring
all trains to blow their horns when they approach crossings that do
not have state-of-the-art safety devices.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to keep impatient drivers off the tracks. An FRA
analysis concluded crossings with conventional gates but no
whistles have 62 percent more accidents than those where horns are
blown.
</P>
<P>
   The Illinois delegation, led by Hastert and Rep. Bill Lipiniski,
a Democrat, wants whistle bans to be allowed at intersections with
lights that have had no more than two accidents in five years, or
for those accident-free for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Crossings that do not meet those criteria would have 10 years,
instead of the two years currently in the proposed regulation, to
upgrade their safety devices.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also would give stronger consideration to
lower-cost alternatives, such as increased law enforcement or a
public awareness campaign, to allow a whistle ban to continue.
</P>
<P>
   FRA spokesman Warren Flatau declined to discuss the lawmakers'
plan but suggested there is room for compromise before the rule is
finalized by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's possible that there are going to be revisions (to the
rule) reflecting all the comments we've received,'' Flatau said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers' involvement follows an outpouring of angry
reaction to the proposal from Illinoisans and others around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve well-attended public hearings were held -- four in the
Chicago area. During the public comment period, which ended May 26,
an unusually large number of people sent letters to the FRA; by
Thursday, 2,734 were posted to the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   They came from individuals, politicians, local officials and
businesses with concerns ranging from worries about plummeting home
values to distrust the proposal would do any good to fears about
how to pay for silencing the whistles.
</P>
<P>
   ''You would have to experience those blasts to realize how
nerve-racking it is,'' wrote Leroy Mally of Oak Lawn, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ''Make no mistake about it, it is a blast of noise that rattles
the windows, that will make you jump up out of a sound sleep, that
will startle you off the couch when you are trying to watch a movie
or read a book. My dog howls in pain because of what it does to her
ears.''

<HEADLINE> 15 arrests made in Colombo crime family's South Florida faction  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) - A joint task-force has arrested 15 of 18 people
charged with running the Colombo crime family's South Florida
gambling, extortion and money laundering operations.
</P>
<P>
   The South Florida ''crew'' of the New York family has pulled in
as much as $2,000 a day in gambling and illegal bookmaking since
1997, according to a six-count federal grand jury indictment
unsealed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that this is a major blow to the Colombo family in
the Southern District of Florida,'' said Rosa Rodriguez-Mera, a
spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first significant bust for the La Cosa Nostra Task
Force, a combined local, state and federal effort aimed at
organized crime, said Jim Leljedal, spokesman for the sheriff's
office in Broward County, the northern neighbor to Miami-Dade
County.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the indicted are still at large, but law enforcement
officials are aware of their movements and expect make arrests
soon, Leljedal said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the arrested were 14 Broward County residents, including
Joseph ''Joey Flowers'' Rotunno, 54, of Pembroke Pines, who ran the
South Florida faction with Reynolds Maragni, 48, of Pompano Beach,
the indictment said. Maragni was also arrested Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Maragni is accused of serving as the link between the South
Florida crew and the top bosses of the Colombo family. Authorities
say Rotunno had control over the group's daily activities.
</P>
<P>
   Rotunno, who authorities say is a long-time member of the mob,
was sentenced in 1986 in Broward County to 3&AMP;frac12; years in prison on
extortion and loan-sharking charges.
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.S. Attorney's Office, the group concentrated
on illegal gambling operations but also was involved in money
laundering, fencing stolen property, credit card fraud and bribing
state workers to get obtain fake driver's licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors said the arrests were the result of a
two-year investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The group was charged under the Racketeering Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations statute.

<HEADLINE> Loophole in Russia Could Backfire  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW KRAMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- A legal loophole applying to holders of state or
military honors could open the prison gates for scores of convicted
and suspected murderers and other serious criminals, prosecutors
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   When parliament passed an amnesty law last month to commemorate
the 55th anniversary of Soviet Union over Germany, deputies said
they were acting to reduce overcrowding in the struggling,
disease-ridden prison system.
</P>
<P>
   The amnesty covered people who committed minor offenses, inmates
suffering from tuberculosis, pregnant women, invalids and those
holding state or military honors regardless of their crime.
</P>
<P>
   The lapse in Russia's usually draconian justice system rang
alarm bells at the prosecutor's office, which has persuaded
legislators to reconsider the law. The lower house of parliament,
the State Duma, may review it Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Those affected include war crimes suspects from Russia's
military campaign in Chechnya, such as a Russian army colonel
accused of raping and killing a Chechen teen-age girl this spring,
a spokesman for the military prosecutor's office said. The colonel
was earlier awarded two medals for his actions in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Also qualifying for amnesty are officers from an airborne unit
accused of planting a suitcase bomb that killed journalist Dmitry
Kholodov in 1994, prosecutor's office spokesman Sergei Ushakov
said.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Ministry spokesman said no one accused or convicted of
grave crimes has yet gone free under the amnesty, but some have
applied.
</P>
<P>
   Suspects in detention centers must admit guilt to take advantage
of the amnesty offer, which some have refused to do.
</P>
<P>
   The Duma, or lower house of parliament, agreed to review the law
after Prosecutor General Vladimir Ustinov sent a letter Wednesday
to the chamber saying 311 convicted and suspected murderers,
rapists and other serious criminals could be set free from jails in
and around Moscow alone.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Ministry, which controls prisons, reported a lower
figure of 40 to 60 in all of Russia, according to a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are socially dangerous people,'' said lawmaker Gennady
Raikov, and releasing the violent men ''is a rather unpleasant idea
for all of us,'' he said, speaking on NTV television news.
</P>
<P>
   The overstuffed and harsh conditions of the country's prisons
motivated the blanket amnesty, one of several passed in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has the largest per capita rate of incarceration in the
world and the second-largest prison population after the United
States, with about 1 million people behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   Tuberculosis afflicts about 100,000 inmates, and about 10,000
inmates die from the illness each year.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Slip on High-Tech Retreat  </HEADLINE>
By SETH SUTEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq ran out of gas Thursday, cutting
short a five-day winning streak that had brought the average above
one important milestone -- 4,000 points -- and nearly above another,
where it began the year.
</P>
<P>
   A hearty selloff in technology stocks was to blame as investors
locked in profits following a weeks-long runup in major bellwethers
such as Oracle and Intel. The Nasdaq composite index fell 127.17,
or 3.1 percent, to 3,936.84.
</P>
<P>
   The damage was less severe in the Dow Jones industrial average,
which fell 121.62, or 1.2 percent, to close at 10,376.12.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq had breached the 4,000-point barrier on Tuesday for
the first time in more than two months. But selling in technology
shares Thursday spread to other sectors, bringing the overall
market lower.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're looking at some profit-taking in that sector, which has
been very strong,'' said Barry Hyman, senior equity analyst at
Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. ''It looks like the big techs that ran
up are giving up some ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest losers included Micron Technology, which fell $5.75
to $85 as traders worried that the chip maker's earnings, due after
the close of trading, might fall short of expectations. The
earnings report actually beat analysts' estimates, however.
</P>
<P>
   Several tech bellwethers gave up some recently won ground,
including Intel, off $4.938 at $134.063; Oracle, down $4.688 at
$81.50; and Cisco Systems, off $2.875 at $64.563. Yahoo! fell
$11.125 to $131.688 after an analyst expressed concerns about the
outlook for online advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Mobile phone maker Nokia was also down on rumors that it was
buying telecom technology company Qualcomm. Nokia shares were off
$4.75 to $56.25, while Qualcomm's shares rose $3.758 to $68.25.
Neither company returned calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into Thursday's trading, the Nasdaq index had climbed
for five straight sessions. The Nasdaq, which was close to breaking
even for the year on Wednesday, remained below its Dec. 31, 1999,
finish of 4,069.31. But it has come back from its low point on May
23, when the Nasdaq was down 28.6 percent from the end of last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Traders were also looking ahead to the Federal Reserve's regular
meeting Tuesday and Wednesday. There have been signals that the
economy has been slowing in response to the Fed's series of
interest rate increases, but investors are still bracing for the
possibility that the Fed may tighten credit further to keep
inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we're digesting the gains of the Nasdaq over the past
four weeks and looking ahead to the Fed meeting and the likelihood
of several earnings confessions next week,'' said Tom Galvin, chief
equity strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said there was little effect from a rumor, quickly
denied by the Fed, that the central bank's chairman, Alan
Greenspan, was in an auto accident.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by an 11-to-6 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, where consolidated volume came to
$1.22 billion, down slightly from 1.21 billion shares Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was off 26.95 at 1,452.18, and
the Russell 2000 index was down 12.60 at 515.01.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.6 percent.
Germany's DAX index fell 0.7 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was down
1.0 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 0.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Clears Korean War Medals  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon has cleared the way for U.S.
veterans of the Korean War to accept and wear a medal offered by
the South Korean government as a tribute to their service and
sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea originally offered the medal in 1951 to all who
fought under the United Nations banner, but the U.S. government
turned it down because American law at that time prohibited members
of the military from wearing medals issued by foreign governments.
Congress changed the law in 1954, but the South Korean government
didn't renew its offer of the ''Republic of Korea War Service
Medal'' until 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, South Korean Defense Minister Cho Seong-tae wrote to
Defense Secretary William Cohen to formally announce that his
government would provide the medal to all U.S. veterans of the war
or to their surviving next of kin. The U.S. Air Force will be in
charge of distributing the medals at no cost to veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Cho said the final decision to offer the medals was timed to
coincide with the 50th anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean
War on June 25.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon also announced Cohen will serve as host of the 50th
anniversary commemorative events Sunday at the Korean War Veterans
Memorial on the National Mall in Washington. President Clinton will
be the keynote speaker at the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   About 1.8 million American military members served in Korea
during the war and nearly 37,000 were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The last foreign medal approved for U.S. military members to
wear was the Kuwait Liberation Medal for veterans of the 1991 war
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   To be eligible for the South Korean medal, U.S. veterans must
have served between the start of the war and the date of the
armistice that ended the fighting on July 27, 1953. They must have
served within the territorial limits of Korea, in the waters
immediately adjacent to Korea or while flying over Korea.
</P>
<P>
   To apply, veterans or the next-of-kin of deceased veterans must
provide a copy of their discharge paper, known as a DD-214. Details
on applying can be obtained by contacting the Air Force Personnel
Center at 1-800-558-1404 or by visiting the personnel center's Web
site at http://www.afpc.randolph.af.mil/awards.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Denounces GOP Medicare Plan  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton assailed Medicare
prescription drug legislation crafted by Republicans as a ''false
promise'' on Thursday and Democrats unexpectedly pushed their own,
more generous plan toward a quick test vote in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a benefit for the companies who make the drugs, not the
seniors who need them most,'' Clinton said of the GOP proposal, his
sharply partisan rhetoric underscoring the potency of the issue in
the run-up to the fall elections.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic counterattack came one day after Republicans
pushed their bill through the House Ways and Means Committee on a
party-line vote. GOP leaders began surveying the rank and file to
gauge support in advance of a scheduled floor vote next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our plan will offer the best prices on the drugs (senior
citizens) need, not some government bureaucracy plan that may not
offer the drug the doctor prescribed,'' said Rep. Phil English of
Pennsylvania, one of several Republicans who touted the GOP
handiwork during the day.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican measure depends on private insurance companies,
supported by government subsidies, to spread prescription drug
coverage nationwide for Medicare beneficiaries. The bill includes
subsidies for low-income senior citizens, as well as those
experiencing extremely high costs.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats attacked it lustily.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton criticized the Republicans in remarks to reporters at
the White House, describing the bill as a politically driven
effort. Donna Shalala, secretary of Labor and Health and Human
Services, traveled to Congress to join House Democratic Leader Dick
Gephardt in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Senate Democrats used a parliamentary maneuver to bring
their bill to the floor under terms that appear to guarantee at
least a procedural vote within a few days.
</P>
<P>
   ''I honestly don't believe that their proposal is a bona fide
proposal so far as Medicare is concerned,'' said Senate Democratic
leader Tom Daschle.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic alternative envisions a uniform
government-defined prescription drug benefit to be offered to all
Medicare recipients. its principal advocates include Sen. Bob
Graham of Florida, whose state is home to millions of retirees, and
Sen. Charles Robb of Virginia, who faces a strong re-election
challenge this fall.
</P>
<P>
   They estimated the premium under their plan at about $35 a
month, with a deductible of $250 a year. After that, the government
and the individual would evenly split the cost of the next $3,500
in drug expenses. The government's share would rise to 75 percent
for annual expenses between $3,500 and $4,000, and the federal
treasury would pick up the entire cost above that amount.
</P>
<P>
   Their bill also provides subsidies for low-income senior
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Graham estimated the cost at roughly $50 billion a year and $240
billion over 10 years, and stressed that once the deductible was
paid, there was no gap in coverage.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the House GOP bill costs an estimated $40 billion
over five years.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also said their bill included provisions designed to
foster competition among providers, and said they hoped it would
help bring Republican support.

<HEADLINE> Big-game losers avenge their defeats in 77th National Marbles Tournament </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILDWOOD, N.J. (AP) - What a difference a year made for two
young marbles aces.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Martinez, 14, of Grand Junction, Colo., and Larin Miller,
12, of Pittsburgh, captured top honors Thursday in the 77th annual
National Marbles Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez won in the boys' division, Miller in the girls'. Each
lost in the final game of competition in the 1999 tournament but
returned this year, along with 56 other boys and girls ages 8 to
14.
</P>
<P>
   ''This feels much better,'' said Martinez, a ninth-grader who
practices two hours a day and says the game of marbles is a
''blast.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many kinds of marbles games, but the one played at the
national tournament is called ''ringer.'' In it, two players line
up 13 marbles inside a circular 10-foot ring and take turns
shooting their object marbles into the target blue marbles,
knocking them out of the ring.
</P>
<P>
   The first person to knock out seven marbles wins the game.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez bested Ralph Dillon, 14, of New Milton, W.Va., in the
boys final; Miller defeated Stephanie Taylor, 13, of Cumberland,
Md., in the girls' division.
</P>
<P>
   She had been to the national tournament twice before, finishing
third in 1998 and second in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last year, she was in the championship and she choked,'' said
her mother, Barbara Miller, 44. ''I knew she wouldn't let that
happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   The winners get $2,000 college scholarships and a slew of small
gifts, including a trophy, a wristwatch, a T-shirt and a velvet
crown.
</P>
<P>
   The hard part is taking the throne. Each year, the winners are
seated in painted wooden thrones and showered with gifts. Then they
have to kiss each other.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have new royalty!'' said Beri Fox, the tournament's
secretary, as the two were seated. Then she ordered them to kiss.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with about 200 people watching and dozens of cameras
trained on the winners, Martinez leaned over and kissed Miller on
the cheek, knocking the crown off her head and onto the ground. His
face was as red as a beet.

<HEADLINE> Lazio misses vote, then news conference on fuel crunch  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - One week after missing a vote to create a
heating oil reserve for the Northeast, Rep. Rick Lazio was a
no-show Thursday at a news conference on soaring gas costs.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate race rival was to headline the
Capitol Hill event with other GOP lawmakers from the Northeast
blasting the Clinton administration for failing to combat rising
prices at the pump. But a half-hour into the news conference, Rep.
Sue Kelly, R-Westchester County, was passed a note saying Lazio
couldn't make it.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's campaign and the GOP conference had both issued releases
touting his appearance on the hot-button consumer issue.
</P>
<P>
   It was a scheduling conflict,'' a Lazio spokesman said
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out Lazio was being interviewed by The New York Times for
a profile.
</P>
<P>
   The average price nationwide for a gallon of regular self-serve
gasoline has reached $1.68 - up nearly 44 percent from last
summer's average - and the high prices at the pump come after New
Yorkers spent a winter paying record prices for heating oil.
</P>
<P>
   After Lazio missed the news conference, reporters sought him out
at his office and were given a statement by aides that criticized
the Clinton administration and outlined three steps to address
rising gas costs.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman proposed exerting pressure on oil-producing
nations to increase production, opening up the U.S.'s strategic oil
reserve and reducing or repealing the federal gasoline tax.

   After the GOP news conference, a man who declined to identify
himself passed out news releases from the Democratic Message Group
attacking Lazio for missing last week's heating oil vote.

<HEADLINE> Drowned pit bull marks latest in series of dog killings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OCEAN CITY, N.J. (AP) - A pit bull drowned after being thrown
into a bay in a weighted container, marking the latest in a rash of
similar killings in southern New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The full-grown 50-pound female had been put in the portable dog
carrier and weighted down with about 20 pounds worth of rocks and
chunks of asphalt, police said.
</P>
<P>
   A boat ramp attendant discovered the animal in the water about 7
a.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got to be pretty twisted to do something like this.
This is just terrible,'' said Mark Pulvino, dog manager for the
Humane Society of Ocean City.
</P>
<P>
   A $500 reward has been offered by the Humane Society for the
arrest and conviction of the person or people responsible. No
arrests have been made, police said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In just over a month, four pit bulls have been found dead in
Bridgeton under mysterious circumstances:
</P>
<P>
   -On May 19, two pit bulls were found hanging from their leashes
in a tree.
</P>
<P>
   -On June 3, a dead pit bull that appeared to have been hanged
was found in the back yard of a home. The dog didn't belong to the
people who lived at the house.
</P>
<P>
   -On Sunday, a Cohansey River fisherman found a pit bull that
drowned after being thrown into the river, an 8-pound rock fastened
to the rope around its neck.
</P>
<P>
   There were developments Thursday in two of those cases. Two men
pleaded guilty to animal cruelty in connection with the May 19
hangings.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Green, 19, and Donray Crawford, 21, both of Bridgeton,
were sentenced to 90 days in jail, fined $500, ordered to undergo
counseling and to perform 30 days community service at the
Cumberland County Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
shelter.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Municipal Court Judge Laura Scruggs ordered both
men to witness the euthanizing of two animals at the shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ''Generally, the deaths of these pit bulls involve dogs that
will not fight,'' said Bev Greco, an SPCA cruelty investigator.
''That's why these people acquire these animals in the first place,
to fight. They don't find out until the dogs are over six months
old that they're not aggressive enough and won't fight, so they
decide, for whatever reason, to kill them.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, police arrested the owner of the pit bull found
drowned Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Spencer, 27, of Bridgeton, was charged with animal
cruelty and released on a summons. He told police the dog was
sickly, so he tied a weight around the neck and threw it into the
river, according to police Lt. Greg Everingham.
</P>
<P>
   ''For $35, he could have called the SPCA. Now, he's staring down
the barrel of the same kind of sentences these guys got today.
These things just defy logic,'' Everingham said.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean City police have asked Bridgeton police to compare notes
from their investigations to see if the killings are related,
Everingham said. Right now, it is not believed that they are, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Pulvino believes there is a correlation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do believe this is related to the Bridgeton one. Either that
or it's a copycat,'' Pulvino said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Concerned Over Gas Prices  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With gasoline and crude prices soaring,
President Clinton expressed concern Thursday that high world oil
prices of more than $30 a barrel will ''rifle throughout the
economy'' if not contained.
</P>
<P>
   The president said that oil prices should be in the $20 to $25 a
barrel range, well below what they are. Despite a decision by OPEC
oil ministers to modestly boost production, crude prices shot up
Thursday to more than $32 a barrel and some analysts said $40 was
no longer unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives have said that the record gasoline prices,
averaging $1.68 a gallon nationwide and more than $2 in parts of
the Midwest, are partly due to the high cost of crude oil, which
accounts for 43 percent the cost of a gallon of gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed on
Wednesday to boost production by about 700,000 barrels a day, a
modest amount that was not expected to have strong impact on U.S.
retail fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   The market dismissed the OPEC overture. West Texas Intermediate
crude for August delivery moved 82 cents higher Thursday to $32.19
a barrel. The 10-year high was $34.37 a barrel in March.
</P>
<P>
   While the $2 plus a gallon gasoline prices in the
Chicago-Milwaukee area has caught the headlines, Clinton said he
was concerned that high crude oil prices also are pushing up fuel
prices for truckers and airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ''So this is going to rifle throughout the economy,'' said
Clinton, speaking to reporters on the South Lawn before departing
for Arizona and California. He said it was ''in the best interest
of the people of the Untied States, but also the oil-producing
countries'' to have prices stabilize in the $20 to $25 a barrel
range.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton said the high cost of crude 'doesn't explain by a
long stretch'' the sharp increase in gasoline prices in parts of
the Midwest, and ''neither does the requirement for special
additives to reduce air pollution.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission, which has begun a formal
investigation into retail gasoline prices, will focus on the wide
difference in price of cleaner burning gasoline -- required since
June 1 in areas with severe summer smog -- and conventional
gasoline. The cleaner fuel has been cited repeatedly by the oil
industry as the reason for much of the price increase in the
Chicago and Milwaukee areas.
</P>
<P>
   FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky told reporters Thursday that the
''high price differential'' between the new blend of cleaner
gasoline and conventional fuel ''has raised significant questions
... that can only be answered with a thorough investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to discuss the investigation further, but said the
FTC would issue an interim report within a month.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, wholesale gasoline prices in the Chicago and
Milwaukee areas have dropped in some areas by about 25 cents a
gallon over the last week, while retail prices have increased
several cents, remaining over $2 a gallon, according to figures
cited by the Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The figures are from surveys conducted by OPIS Energy Group, a
private company that tracks national energy prices in detail.
</P>
<P>
   High energy costs, and particularly gasoline prices, continued
to produce finger pointing by members of Congress and the campaigns
of both Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and a string of Republicans in Congress blamed the Clinton
administration of failing to stand up to OPEC countries and
pursuing an energy policy that thwarts domestic oil production.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really being driven by the fact that we're just dependent
on OPEC oil,'' Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., told
reporters, accusing the president of ''groping'' for an answer to
high energy prices. He said ways have to be found for more domestic
production, including opening up an Alaska arctic refuge to oil
drilling.
</P>
<P>
   Gore suggested price gouging. ''Big oil may have gotten too
big,'' he said, adding quickly that he was not suggesting a breakup
of oil companies. And Clinton reeled off a string of initiatives he
said he had sent to Congress to spur energy conservation, but which
the Republican-led Congress has ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Oil industry spokesmen denied any companies are involved in
illegal pricing activities. ''The market is working. The (gasoline)
prices are falling,'' said Red Cavaney, president of the American
Petroleum Institute.

<HEADLINE> State Dept Offers Security Increase  </HEADLINE>
By FREDERIC J. FROMMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Trying to assuage a senator who is holding up
seven ambassadorial nominees, State Department officials said
Thursday they will recommend increased security provisions for
foreign service employees.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Rod Grams, R-Minn., blocked the nominations of the career
foreign service officers because they have compiled roughly 100
security violations, with one person responsible for more than 20.
He has not named the people or disclosed the violations.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Grossman, director general of the Foreign Service, told
Grams he will propose decreasing the number of infractions that
trigger disciplinary action and increasing penalties for security
incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying before Grams' Senate Foreign Relations Committee's
international operations subcommittee, Grossman also said the State
Department would put a greater emphasis on ''security performance''
when considering nominations.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, Grams indicated such moves could prompt him
to lift the holds.
</P>
<P>
   ''Like Ronald Reagan said -- trust but verify,'' he said. ''We
want to see some of these steps taken. Many could be taken within
weeks. (Secretary of State Madeleine Albright) will get this
information, and the quicker she responds, the quicker we can act
on the nominees.''
</P>
<P>
   During the hearing, Grams criticized the State Department for
not placing more emphasis on security.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a result, State Department personnel are judged on the
basis of their cultural sensitivity but not on security,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman and David Carpenter, the assistant secretary of state
for diplomatic security, complimented Grams for raising the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''Your commitment has had an important impact on the
department,'' said Grossman, who took his job Monday. ''As I
promised in my confirmation hearing, you will find me ready to do
what we must to protect our secrets.''

<HEADLINE> Court rules trash fees are unconstitutional  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - New Jersey counties cannot force trash
haulers and towns that no longer use their expensive trash burners
and landfills to help pay for them, the state Supreme Court ruled
Thursday in a split decision.
</P>
<P>
   So-called environmental investment charges are unconstitutional
because the Legislature never specifically authorized counties to
pass on such fees to former trash customers, the court ruled.
</P>
<P>
   But the justices postponed the effective date of their ruling
for three months, to give state lawmakers time to craft a solution
for counties left with huge trash facility debt.
</P>
<P>
   Absent legislative action in 90 days, Thursday's decision leaves
cash-strapped counties with few choices. They could raise trash
tipping fees for current customers, raise property taxes, or
default on their bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Some counties started imposing the special fees in the aftermath
of a 1997 federal court ruling that stripped counties of the power
to control the flow of trash within their borders. That ruling led
many haulers and municipalities to send their garbage to cheaper
facilities, depriving the counties of the revenue flow they were
counting on to make loan payments.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Passaic County planned to raise $80 million in
environmental investment charges to pay off debt it incurred
planning one landfill it later abandoned and reserving space in
another.
</P>
<P>
   But the city of Paterson, which no longer uses Passaic County's
trash services, fought the charge. On Thursday, the city celebrated
its victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''Paterson's future is brighter today than yesterday,'' said
Mayor Marty Burns in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Under the county's formula, the city was expected to pay more
than 30 percent of the trash fee for the entire county based on
past usage, far higher than its 11 percent portion of the county's
tax base, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Sandra Ayres, who represents Paterson, said it was
unfair for the county to unduly burden the city given that the
county used its overall property tax base to secure some of the
trash debt.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were considering an unlawful charge that requires us to
pay more? Of course we'd fight it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic, Cape May, Gloucester and Union counties are the others
that imposed environmental investment charges to recover their
share of the total $1.2 billion in trash debt statewide.
</P>
<P>
   These counties were relying on a 1977 statute that officials
said authorized them to charge both old and new customers a new fee
for old debt.
</P>
<P>
   But by a slim 4-3 margin, the justices disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the majority, Associate Justice Stein said that it
was too much of a stretch to use a ''mundane'' statute ''to address
an unanticipated statewide solid waste financial crisis that arose
20 years after the statute's adoption.
</P>
<P>
   ''No principle of statutory construction could condone so
extraordinary an interpretation,'' he wrote in the 57-page opinion.
</P>
<P>
   But in a dissent, Associate Justice Virginia Long said it was
not unreasonable to tap the 1977 law to allow the special charges
to stand - especially given the consequences if the counties were
left with no other recourse to pay their debt.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no reason why we should adopt an equal (not better)
interpretation that would have the effect of creating a fiscal
emergency and compelling legislative intervention,'' she said of
the majority.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Benjamin Clarke, who represented Passaic County, said he
hopes state lawmakers finally take notice of the problem, which has
been brewing since the 1997 federal court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has clearly been a difficult political issue and
continues to be one. But this decision obviously creates
substantial additional pressure to implement remedial
legislation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Celeste Carpiano, executive director of the New Jersey
Association of Counties, agreed that the new deadline and the risk
of widespread bond defaults will force action.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman promised cooperation to meet the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will work with the Legislature to develop a long-term
solution to the stranded debt problem,'' she said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Questions Chinese News Bureau  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Chinese news agency Xinhua has created a
flurry of news itself with the revelation it is buying a building
near the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   After the planned purchase became known, the State Department
said Thursday it has reminded the Chinese Embassy that a
15-year-old law requires it to apply for permission whenever the
government-affiliated news agency wants to buy or sell real estate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have informed them that they must make such a request, and
the State Department will have 60 days in which to authorize or
deny such a request when it's made,'' State Department spokesman
Philip T. Reeker said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Xinhua has said it plans to use the seven-story building in
Arlington, Va., -- less than a mile from the Pentagon -- for a new
news room and for housing. The building provides a distant view of
some of the Pentagon outer wall.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said it would evaluate whether the purchase would
pose a security problem.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Defense Department was concerned, spokesman Kenneth
Bacon said: ''It's not new to us, the idea that people might want
to watch or listen to what goes on in the building, and We've been
living in that environment ... for over 50 years.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We obviously have a number of countermeasures that we've
installed over time to defeat or foil surveillance,'' Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon and State Department learned of the Chinese plans
Wednesday when the Washington Times reported it and quoted analysts
who feared it could be used for spying.
</P>
<P>
   Xinhua's bureau chief, Jiang Liu, denied the agency is engaged
in spying, and Chinese Embassy spokesman Zhang Yuanyuan said Xinhua
was advised by its American lawyers that it had followed U.S. laws.
</P>
<P>
   Reeker said the Chinese were notified in 1985 that they would
have to obtain prior authorization for any purchase or sale of real
property by Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
   ''The restriction remains in place today, and Xinhua is aware of
it,'' he said. He said there is no record that Xinhua notified the
department of plans to purchase the Arlington property.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang, speaking for the embassy, said Chinese officials
understood that diplomats but not news organizations were required
to get permission for property purchases. He said Xinhua's
personnel do not carry diplomatic visas, and the agency is
registered in Virginia as a private, profit-making company.
</P>
<P>
   ''The news agency wants to do everything correctly,'' he said
and officials plan to discuss the issue with the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang Liu, the Xinhua bureau chief, called suggestions that the
news agency was involved in spying ''a tale from 'The Arabian
Nights.'''

<HEADLINE> State approves millions for vocational technical schools  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - The state Board of Education has approved
plans for millions of dollars in renovations to vocational
technical schools in Manchester, Hartford and Danbury.
</P>
<P>
   Howell Cheney Regional Vocational-Technical School in Manchester
would get a $45 million face lift and expansion. In a meeting
Wednesday, the board also approved plans for renovations and
expansions at A.I. Prince Vocational-Technical School in Hartford,
estimated to cost $67.9 million, and at Henry Abbott Regional
Vocational-Technical School in Danbury, at a price of $50.8
million.
</P>
<P>
   Those schools - which Education Commissioner Theodore S. Sergi
called the ''neediest'' in the 17-school vo-tech system - would be
the first to undergo major renovations since 1999, when the
legislature agreed to allow the State Board of Education to seek
state bonding funds for renovations through the same process as
other school districts.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is historic for our school system,'' Cheney Tech Director
Bruce Sievers said. ''This will begin the biggest phase of
construction since the 1950s, when many of our schools were
built.''
</P>
<P>
   The board's action meets a June 30 deadline for districts to
submit proposed school projects to the Education Department, if
they want them included in the list of construction projects that
will go before the 2001 legislature.
</P>
<P>
   But the board directed the staff to fine-tune and prioritize the
proposals. Board members said they were concerned about the large
amount of money involved, and Sergi said the board will have to be
able to justify all the work to Gov. John G. Rowland's office.
</P>
<P>
   The projects would create more space for trade areas and
classrooms and renovate other sections of the colleges.

<HEADLINE> Indian land claim headed to court  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - Saying neither side was genuinely
committed to negotiations, a discouraged federal judge ruled
Thursday the Oneida Indian land claim dispute will be settled in
court.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge Neal P. McCurn said failure to agree
on a sales tax formula was the deal breaker, pushing the protracted
fight from the negotiating table to the court room. He will set a
court date in the near future for litigation he said ''undoubtedly
will take years to run its course.''
</P>
<P>
   In his four-page decision, McCurn said ''there is no point in
proceeding any further.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent round of negotiations just two weeks ago, all sides
went home without making progress toward a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   McCurn had ordered the Oneida Indian nations of New York,
Wisconsin and Canada, the U.S. Department of Justice, Madison and
Oneida counties, and the state of New York to explain their
positions on the ''gut'' issues that have been holding up a
settlement on the largest and oldest Indian land dispute in the
eastern United States.
</P>
<P>
   The parties have been trying since February 1999 to sort out how
much land the Oneidas can have for their reservation in the two
central New York counties and how much authority their sovereign
government can assert on that land. There also are legal questions
about a sales tax formula and gaming rights on the land.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is certainly enough blame to go around for the fact that
following a full day of intense mediation efforts ... settlement
efforts were halted,'' McCurn wrote. ''The court cannot help but
observe, however, that on that day, as throughout much of the
mediation process, not all of the parties were genuinely committed
to settling this lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   Oneida Nation spokesman Mark Emery said he is confident a trial
will uphold the Indian nation's position.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody would have been happier with a resolution
obviously,'' Emery said. ''Certainly the judge put blame on
everybody and certainly everybody had some share of that blame.''
</P>
<P>
   Oneida County Executive Ralph Eannace could immediately be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   McCurn chided the New York Oneidas, the counties and the state
government for their stubbornness, saying not one was willing to
''subordinate their own self-interests in an attempt to arrive at a
fair settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oneidas are seeking compensation for 250,000 acres of land
they claim the state purchased illegally in the late 18th and early
19th centuries. Yearlong negotiations broke off April 4.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a settlement, the counties have insisted the
1,100-member Oneida Indian Nation of New York pay property taxes
and collect sales taxes from non-Indians who purchase goods on
reservation land.
</P>
<P>
   The Oneidas have offered to pay the counties $20 million, in the
form of $1 million each year for 20 years, to offset sales taxes
they say sovereign Indian nations do not have to collect. They also
have offered to set aside $25 million of the settlement money for
the counties to offset unpaid property taxes and limit their
reservation to 40,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   The state, meanwhile, has asked for 25 percent of the Oneidas'
Turning Stone casino earnings, and negotiators for the state and
federal governments have offered to contribute equally to a $500
million pot of settlement money. That plan, however, would have to
be approved by both the state Legislature and Congress.

<HEADLINE> Osteoporosis Gets Surprise Helper  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A cholesterol-lowering drug taken by millions to
prevent heart attacks might also protect women from having
osteoporosis-linked bone fractures, offering a safe alternative to
hormone replacement therapy.
</P>
<P>
   New research, published this week in The Lancet medical journal,
shows that women over 60 who took the statin cholesterol drugs for
at least a year had half the risk of breaking bones.
</P>
<P>
   Hormone replacement therapy, taken by post-menopausal women
partly to head off osteoporosis, has also been shown to reduce
cholesterol levels. But it also increases the risk of breast
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Statins -- marketed in the United States as Mevacor, Zocor,
Lipitor, Lescol and Pravachol -- have been around for years and have
a long safety record. They can sometimes cause reversible minor
injury to the liver or, rarely, muscle inflammation.
</P>
<P>
   While current osteoporosis drugs slow bone erosion, previous
studies investigating statins have indicated they might restore
bone lost to the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a big step and an important step,'' said Douglas
Bauer, a professor of medicine, epidemiology and biostatistics at
the University of California in San Francisco, who was not
connected with the study. ''It basically confirms highly suggestive
evidence found in the lab. It's encouraging enough to prompt large
studies to see if statins really prevent fractures.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Three to five years from now, we could well be prescribing
women statins instead of estrogens,'' said Bauer, who has done
similar research. ''This could really be applicable to a huge
number of women.''
</P>
<P>
   Osteoporosis, also known as brittle-bone disease, affects about
one in three women and about one in 10 men. It gradually weakens
bones and often leads to painful and crippling fractures.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty percent of those who suffer hip fractures die within a
year because of complications and many more never return to
independent living.
</P>
<P>
   About half of women over 50 have a fracture because of
osteoporosis sometime during their lives.
</P>
<P>
   In the study by scientists at Brigham and Women's Hospital in
Boston, 928 women over 60 who had suffered a bone fracture linked
to osteoporosis between October 1996 and September 1997 were
matched with a total of 2,747 women of the same age from the same
health maintenance organizations who had not fractured a bone.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers examined all the women's health insurance claims
and pharmacy dispensing records for the year the fractures occurred
and the two previous years to see who had been taking statins and
for how long. They also tracked who had been taking cholesterol
drugs other than statins.
</P>
<P>
   They found that compared with women who had no record of statin
prescriptions during the previous two years, those who had been on
the drugs for at least a year were half as likely to fracture a
bone.
</P>
<P>
   People with cholesterol problems are also often overweight. Body
fat protects bones by cushioning a fall and by making the bones
stronger because the skeleton has to support the extra weight.
</P>
<P>
   But it's unlikely that the women taking statins were protected
from fractures because of any extra weight, said Dr. K. Arnold
Chan, a drug epidemiologist at Brigham and Women's who led the
study.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although we cannot be sure that body weight is the
explanation, we mostly ruled that out,'' Chan said. ''We would have
expected to see a similar effect for the non-statin drugs, and we
didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The statin drugs used in the study are sold generically as
lovastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin, fluvastatin and pravastatin.
The research was not paid for by any of the drug companies that
market the drugs worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Bill Contains Money for Coal Usage  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Interior Department spending bill passed
Thursday by the Senate Appropriations Committee includes $1 million
aimed at retaining the use of coal on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., inserted
the provision in the $15.5 billion bill.
</P>
<P>
   It calls for the architect of the Capitol and the Department of
Energy to use the $1 million to study new coal technologies that
could be used at the plant, which heats and cools the Capitol and
surrounding buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Capitol architect Alan Hantman last month submitted a plan to
Congress to upgrade the plant that did not involve the use of coal.
</P>
<P>
   But Sens. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.,
convinced Hantman to withdraw the plan and study emerging coal
technologies thought to produce less pollutants.
</P>
<P>
   ''The continued use of coal is important for the nation and
vital to the livelihoods of thousands of Kentucky families,''
McConnell said in a statement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   West Virginia and Kentucky are the second- and third-ranked coal
producing states, trailing only Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly century-old plant, a few blocks from the Capitol,
uses coal to heat the buildings in the winter. It uses a
combination of natural gas and electricity in the summer, because
they emit less pollutants than coal.
</P>
<P>
   The plant is one of the city's single biggest emitters of
nitrogen oxide, a component of smog. The city and its suburbs
consistently violate federal smog standards.

<HEADLINE> Assembly committees approve new penalties for Ecstasy drug  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The day after undercover agents seized
2,000 tablets of the drug Ecstasy at a train station, two
legislative committees Thursday cleared a bill designed to
dramatically increase criminal penalties for possessing the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officers claim the drug now popular among teens
and young adults at so-called rave parties can cause sudden
illness, including artificially high temperatures that can kill.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's arrest of two Brooklyn men at the Hamilton Township
Train Station highlights the problem with the current law,
officials said. If convicted, the suspects would face a maximum of
five years in state prison. First offenders likely see probation.
</P>
<P>
   The new bill would make that sentence 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman last week proposed the bill and she
praised legislators Thursday for moving quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ''With Ecstasy fast becoming the drug of choice among young
people, the swift passage of this legislation will help drive home
the message to parents and teen-agers about the dangers of the drug
and the price that would be paid if it's used,'' Whitman said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Judiciary Committee and the Assembly Law and Public
Safety Committee each unanimously passed versions of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The full Senate is scheduled to vote Monday; no date is set for
the lower house vote.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman wants to put Ecstasy in the same legal class as heroin
and cocaine. People holding 5 ounces or more - about 500 of pills
that carry a street price tag of $20 - would face a prison term of
up to 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   What drug users call Ecstasy is the synthetic compound 3-4
methylene-dioxy-methamphetamine, or MDMA. Other similar compounds
found to be dangerous have sometimes been sold under the same name,
and other nicknames include ''X,'' ''XTC,'' and ''Adam.''
</P>
<P>
   Possessing Ecstasy now rates as a third-degree criminal drug
offense with a maximum prison sentence of five years. State law
sets no degrees of punishment for offenders with increasing amounts
of the drug.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects arrested at the train station face the same penalty
with those 2,000 pills as those caught with 20 or 20,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''This case graphically illustrates the alarming amount of
Ecstasy destined for our suburbs,'' said Mercer County Prosecutor
Daniel G. Giaquinto.
</P>
<P>
   ''The quantity seized and the reality that it only constitutes a
third-degree offense underscores the need for legislation which
increases the penalties,'' the prosecutor said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed law keeps the third-degree offense only for those
caught with less than half an ounce. Offenders with between half an
ounce and 5 ounces would face up to 10 years in prison, a
second-degree crime. Each ounce is about 100 pills.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also provide for warnings to parents and
teen-agers through the state Health and Education departments about
the risks of Ecstasy. The warning will include letters home and
posters for schools and health facilities.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Clears Uranium Shipments  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton has moved to guarantee that
money paid to Russia as part of a swords-to-plowshares uranium deal
is not seized by creditors, clearing the way for resumed shipments
of processed Russian uranium to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The president issued an executive order Thursday protecting
payments made to Russia under the deal. Russia had been concerned
that payments would be seized by creditors trying to collect a past
unrelated debts from Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The order frees Russia to resume shipping low enriched uranium
that has been blended down after being taken from nuclear weapons
stockpiles, so it can be used in U.S. commercial reactors.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the uranium has been ruled off-limits by Clinton,
''we're expecting shipments to start again next week,'' said
Elizabeth Stuckle, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Enrichment Corp.,
which is the U.S. agent for the Russian uranium purchases.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is a cornerstone of U.S. attempts to get Russia to
dispose of nuclear weapons material so that it doesn't fall into
the hands of terrorists or other rogue groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're telling Russia we will not allow the proceeds of this
sale to be attached to unrelated litigation, so you can resume
shipments with confidence,'' said White House spokesman P.J.
Crowley.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's minister of atomic energy notified Energy Secretary
Bill Richardson on May 5 that uranium shipments would be halted
because of concerns that the proceeds would be seized as part of
the unrelated litigation by a Swiss creditor.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said suspension of the uranium sales posed ''an unusual
and extraordinary threat'' to U.S. national security because
uranium that could be used for nuclear weapons is accumulating in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   For the last few weeks, uranium has been held at a dock in St.
Petersburg because of the uncertainty over the creditor's legal
claims, Stuckle said.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-year contract, worth about $11 billion, calls for Russia
to export more than 500 tons of recycled uranium from scrapped
weapons to the United States. So far, about 80 tons have been sent.

<HEADLINE> Fire in Australian Hostel Kills 8  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) -- A pre-dawn fire tore through a hostel
filled with international backpackers in eastern Australia Friday,
killing at least eight people, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters used hydraulic platforms to pull 70 people to
safety from the blazing, wooden building in Childers, 130 miles
north of Brisbane.
</P>
<P>
   Nine people were treated at a hospital for smoke inhalation.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-six people were believed inside the two-story structure
when the blaze broke out around 12:30 a.m., said local fire
commissioner Jeff Wright. Eight bodies were recovered and eight
people were unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
   firefighters put out the blaze after about four hours.
Authorities were searching through the ruins and trying to
determine the cause of the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   The identities of the victims weren't immediately known.
Officials said many of the hostel residents were British working as
seasonal workers picking fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Heidrich, the editor of the town's newspaper, was one of
the first on the scene, and said terrified survivors were in shock
when he got there.
</P>
<P>
   ''The residents of the hostel who had been evacuated were
sitting across the road watching the hostel burn,'' Heidrich told
Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
</P>
<P>
   Wright said that at the height of the fire, residents fled
across adjoining rooftops to escape the flames.

<HEADLINE> GOP Pushes Forward Disclosure Bill  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans pushed forward legislation that
would require well-established nonprofit organizations to disclose
the names of people who pay for any political activity.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats complained the bill was too broad, probably
unconstitutional and intended to destroy a legitimate effort to
force newly popular, often secretive political groups to disclose
their donors. Democrats and their GOP ally, Sen. John McCain, also
complained the bill included labor unions but not corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was hoping the Republicans really wanted to pass something
but there doesn't appear to be a good-faith interest in that. They
quite clearly don't want a bill,'' said Rep. Lloyd Doggett,
D-Texas, who has led the Democratic effort in the House. ''I think
the idea is to just run the clock out.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill was approved by the House Ways and Means Committee
Thursday on a party line vote, 23-14, and moves to the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   It's the GOP answer to a Democratic bill that aims to give the
public more information about groups that organize under section
527 of the tax code, which is set aside for political
organizations. Under current law, these groups can appear from
nowhere and do not have to tell the public anything about
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans complained that it was unfair to require
disclosure by these groups when other nonprofits across the
political spectrum also engage in similar attempts to influence
elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''It shouldn't be disclosure for some and secrecy for others,''
said Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas. ''It should be
disclosure for all and sunshine on the entire political process.''
</P>
<P>
   One of these groups that organize under that portion of the tax
code is tied to House GOP Whip Tom Delay, R-Texas, who on Thursday
fired off a letter to McCain, complaining about McCain's
castigation of the groups using the 527 section.
</P>
<P>
   ''By employing emotionally overwrought rhetoric that places
Americans contributing to these groups on the same level as evil
criminals, you rashly condemn many citizens who are simply pursuing
their First Amendment right to join the debate,'' Delay wrote to
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, R-Ariz., brushed him off with a reference to a World War
II battle: ''In the words of General McAuliffe, when asked by the
Germans to surrender at Bastogne: 'Nuts.'''
</P>
<P>
   All of these groups -- no matter where they fall in the tax code
-- manage to avoid reporting their contributors and spending to the
Federal Election Commission by avoiding use of words such as ''vote
for'' and ''vote against'' in their ads and materials. As far as
the FEC is concerned, these groups say, they are simply discussing
issues.
</P>
<P>
   But section 527 groups, by registering in this section of the
tax code, are declaring themselves to be engaged in politics, not
issues. Early this month, McCain and others persuaded the Senate to
require them to disclose donors and spending.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats pushed similar legislation, but GOP leaders
argued that the law should also include other non-profit groups.
</P>
<P>
   But the GOP bill crafted by Rep. Amo Houghton, R-N.Y., goes too
far, said Doggett and his Democratic colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   They complained the bill was probably unconstitutional. The
courts have said that people have a right to privately join
together in associations. Democrats suggested getting around this
by requiring all groups to disclose contributors, but only for
spending in the months preceding an election. Republicans insisted
on disclosure year-round.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also complained that the bill excluded for-profit
corporations and could be interpreted to include voter registration
drives, lobbying on legislation and other activity not directly
tied to an election.
</P>
<P>
   Doggett said that he believed Houghton was sincere in his effort
but was forced by GOP leaders -- namely Delay -- to write a bill that
could not pass.
</P>
<P>
   But Trent Duffy, a spokesman for Republicans on Ways and Means,
said the Democrats' really objection was that the legislation
required unions to say who is paying for their communications with
members when they work to get out the vote.

<HEADLINE> Possible Flu Vaccine Shortage Seen  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Influenza vaccines could arrive a month later
than usual this fall and shortages are possible, the government
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A notice was sent to health care agencies asking them to plan
their mass flu vaccinations for November rather than the usual
mid-October start.
</P>
<P>
   ''Several vaccine manufacturers are having difficulty getting
one of the vaccine components to grow as well as they expected,''
said Nancy Cox, chief of the influenza branch of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Cox said that and other production problems could also cause a
shortage of vaccine but the CDC won't know that until later on in
the summer. ''At the current time we expect there will be
sufficient vaccine available to immunize those at high risk,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals, nursing homes and health care organizations are
beginning to plan campaigns to immunize large numbers of people and
need to know now that they might not get the vaccine at the usual
time, Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   If a substantial shortfall occurs, the CDC will recommend making
it a priority to vaccinate those most at risk.

<HEADLINE> Frequent 'atrocious' discriminatory conduct alleged in $1 billion lawsuit </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A group of 50 current and former minority
employees of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center of New York
alleged in a $1 billion lawsuit Thursday that they were subject to
''atrocious discriminatory conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan portrayed
the convention center as a cesspool of graphic racial, religious
and sexual slurs ''designed to deprive plaintiffs of their dignity
and their humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   It said the center ''subjects its minority employees to a
deplorable work environment rife with discrimination and
hostility.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Eisgrau, a Javits spokesman, declined to comment ''since
it's in litigation now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Javits Center has tax-exempt status and its board is
appointed by Gov. George Pataki and top state officials.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit asserted violations of the U.S. Constitution as well
as state and local laws. It sought $500 million in compensatory
damages and $500 million in punitive damages, along with a court
order preventing discriminatory conduct in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs included 11 carpenters and 31 freight handlers,
both job classifications that limit the hours an employee works
according to whether there are events at the convention center
requiring their expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an employee pool that is evenly divided between whites
and minorities, a high percentage of those chosen for a seniority
list of people actually called to work are white, according to the
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   It alleged that a seniority list of 60 names included 50 whites,
seven black men and three Hispanic men.
</P>
<P>
   The workers allege that other violations and insults were
repeatedly committed by a group of managers and foremen, all white
men of Irish decent except for one Irish woman and one black man.
</P>
<P>
   The lone black foreman was promoted to the position only after
convention center managers became aware that a federal
discrimination lawsuit was in the works, the lawsuit alleged.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs said they were routinely subjected to derogatory
racial slurs and sexually offensive innuendo.
</P>
<P>
   ''The vicious slurs were shamelessly condoned by top level
management. Even worse, some top level managers participated in
this horrendous conduct,'' the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   It singled out Richard Powers, a member of the management staff
responsible for maintenance and operation of the Javits Center,
including hiring, firing, promotion and discipline of employees.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleged that every plaintiff had heard Powers
repeatedly use ethnic slurs and make derogatory comments about
women such as: ''I don't want women in the building, especially not
black women, unless they work for housekeeping.''
</P>
<P>
   Powers, reached at the convention center Thursday, listened to
the allegations against him and then declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs also allege that racially oppressive and
threatening depictions remain on bathroom walls at Javits for
months or years, including drawings of a black man being lynched
and Nazi swastikas.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit said one of the plaintiffs, David Cokely, had
complained about being called a series of racial slurs and later
found the phrase ''David Cokely is a black bastard who will die''
written on a bathroom wall.
</P>
<P>
   His car tires were slashed, his windows broken, another employee
urinated in his Gatorade bottle and others repeatedly made death
threats against him, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit also said that a foreman was seen on the docks one
day searching for a black employee while holding a bunch of bananas
and yelling, ''Where's my monkeys?''

<HEADLINE> Riding No. 7 Into the Lion's Den  </HEADLINE>
By JIM LITKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Bible doesn't go into much detail about how Daniel arrived
in the lion's den, but you can be sure it wasn't on the No. 7
train.
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker's desire to come to New York next week and face his
demons is understandable. Almost admirable, in fact. But it's also
shortsighted, ill-timed, unnecessarily expensive and unlikely to do
anyone any good -- least of all Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   The last time a tourist arrived in Gotham this unprepared, it
was Jack Lemmon in the 1970 comedy called ''The Out-of-Towners.''
He played a guy who goes to New York for a job interview and ends
up on a hellish train ride, gets fleeced by hustlers and chased by
cops. The difference in real life is that all this could happen to
Rocker, too, and he might still have to pitch his way out of a
bases-loaded jam in snarling, seething Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Those who insist Rocker will have to get this over with sooner
or later are right. And not just for the macho value of being able
to say he wasn't run out of town. He has to know that no
organization will waste a roster spot on a player who can't
accompany the team to New York. But if I'm Rocker's travel agent,
the recommendation is a nice three-night package in late September
instead. Maybe the last week of the season, when the Atlanta Braves
make their only other appearance at Shea. The timing has to be
better.
</P>
<P>
   Relief pitching is a high-wire act. It requires not just a lot
of sound body parts working in unison, but nerves of steel and more
than a fair share of good luck. Rocker is having trouble with all
three right now. Struggling is something he did very little of in
his almost-unbroken run from preps to pros, but Rocker is making up
for lost time.
</P>
<P>
   At home against the Cubs on Wednesday, he gave up five earned
runs in only one-third of an inning. He only yielded one hit, but
walked four batters and hit another. His wildness reminded
Chicago's Mark Grace of another reliever whose wackiness cost him a
job before his time.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's Mitch Williams -- with 10 mph more,'' Grace said, shaking
his head. ''I don't know what they're going to do, but they have to
do something.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Braves don't have a plan, either. They can't give him
away and, right now, they can't get much for him. After his
disastrous stint the other night, Rocker sat in the dugout next to
pitching coach Leo Mazzone. That would be the same guy who said
this when the famous Sports Illustrated story came out last
December:
</P>
<P>
   ''Baseball's a very humbling game. The first thing I think about
after I hear about this, he's going to go out and blow himself out.
One of his teammates might punch him out. Something's going to go
wrong now with his career. And you watch, it'll end up going
straight down the tubes.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker's grip is tenuous enough and a trip to New York could
push him over the edge. When he was sent down to the minors
recently, the Braves said he had to work on his control. He threw
30 pitches against the Cubs and only nine for strikes. He is
averaging a hit per inning worked. His earned-run average is 5.85,
and his walk-to-strikeout ratio is 1-to-1. It's clear he has no
control.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, Rocker could take comfort in not being the only member
of his fraternity who is struggling. Billy Wagner of the Astros was
one of the game's best closers last season, converting 39 saves in
42 opportunities with a 1.49 ERA. This season, he's blown nine of
15 saves and perhaps the tendon in his throwing arm as well. One
difference between him and Rocker is that Wagner has plenty of
friends in the clubhouse and more than a few supporters in the
Houston front office.
</P>
<P>
   The only reason Rocker's even on a big-league roster is because
of yet another problem with oft-injured Rudy Seanez. Like everybody
else in baseball, even the Braves are desperate for pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping Rocker home would seem to benefit almost everyone, but
general manager John Schuerholz sounded indifferent when asked
about Rocker's plan to ride the No. 7 train to next week's series.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a nonissue for me,'' he said. ''Guys travel to the
ballpark however they like.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be an issue, though, for New York, which will have to
pay for hundreds of extra cops to be on hand to ensure Rocker is
safe riding past Woody Allen's film studio and through
neighborhoods packed with Asians and Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   It's small comfort, but Rocker can count on one thing. If he
makes it to the end of the line, the No. 7 will drop him off closer
to Shea than his pitches have been around the plate lately.

<HEADLINE> Officers shoot man with machete in White Plains  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - A 21-year-old man who was brandishing
a machete in downtown White Plains on Thursday was shot when he
lunged, screaming, at two police officers, a police spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Guy, whose address was not made public, survived the
shooting and was recovering from surgery at White Plains Hospital,
said city police Capt. Peter Viviano.
</P>
<P>
   The officers, whose names were not released, were taken to
hospitals for treatment of emotional trauma; one was admitted at
the Westchester Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Viviano said Guy was spotted on the corner of Chester Avenue and
East Post Road with his 2-foot-long machete. A passer-by went into
the nearby Westchester County probation offices and notified a
county policeman.
</P>
<P>
   That policeman, joined by a probation officer, ordered Guy to
drop the machete. He refused twice, then screamed and charged at
the officers, Viviano said. They fired their service weapons and
Guy was hit in the abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   The county police and probation departments were investigating
the shootings, Viviano said. Guy was charged with first-degree
attempted murder.

<HEADLINE> House GOP Members Question Census  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans questioned the quality of
work produced by the Census Bureau in a count that is ahead of
schedule and said the shortcomings may affect the accuracy of the
raw data collected for Census 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., chairman of the House Government Reform
Committee's census panel, said some Census Bureau employees may
have been pressured by performance-based incentives while others
took procedural shortcuts in gathering information.
</P>
<P>
   Census-takers are finishing a 10-week operation of gathering
information from homes that did not return a questionnaire. Census
officials said the incentive program was not based on how fast
Census 2000 data was collected, but other statistical and
administrative tasks performed by the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Census director Kenneth Prewitt said he was confident in the
quality of work being produced and assured that quality-control
procedures ferreted out inaccurate information. Census officials
highlighted one Census office in Hialeah, Fla. where enumerators
are now re-interviewing over 11,000 households after a procedural
discrepancy was found.
</P>
<P>
   ''While we are pleased with progress thus far, there remain
several operations that will improve what already is a good
census,'' Prewitt said. ''I have said numerous times that any
national statistic -- including the census count -- is an estimate of
the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt also said, however, that the most accurate estimate uses
a statistical method known as ''sampling,'' in which the results of
a separate, random sample of 314,000 households will be used to
adjust the raw population count from Census 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of sampling say it helps account for segments of the
population undercounted in prior counts, including minorities, the
poor, and inner-city residents -- groups that tend to vote
Democratic. Many Republicans in Congress oppose the sampling
technique, and favor an actual head count. GOP leaders fear using
the sampled numbers could lead to reshaped districts with higher
concentrations of Democratic voters.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court last year said the reapportionment of House
seats must be based on raw, non-sampled data. However, it left open
the option for states to use statistically adjusted numbers for
purposes of redrawing political boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing Thursday, Republicans voiced concern that Census
officials were rushing through the count. With about two weeks left
to a self-imposed deadline, the Census Bureau has reached over 99
percent of the country's 120 million households.
</P>
<P>
   ''I get the feeling that if they were slow, (Republicans) would
call it a failed census. Now, since it's moving quickly, you're
calling it a rushed census,'' countered Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New
York, ranking member of the subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Maloney was also angered by the House's proposed budget for the
Census Bureau next fiscal year. Dan DuBray, spokesman for Rep.
Harold Rogers, R-Ky., chairman of the House Appropriations
subcommittee overseeing Census Bureau funding, said spending being
considered is $48.3 million less than the $719 million the Clinton
administration requested.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau got $4.7 billion for fiscal 2000, but that
included $4.4 billion for this year's census. The cut ''might pose
a serious threat to getting corrected data released,'' Maloney
said.
</P>
<P>
   Census Bureau spokesman Steve Jost said the cut could hamper the
agency's collection of economic data, including the Consumer Price
Index and unemployment figures.
</P>
<P>
   Subcommittee Republicans on Thursday also criticized the Justice
Department's response Monday to a lawsuit filed by Virginia over
sampled data. Justice asked the U.S. District Court for the
District of Columbia to dismiss or delay proceedings in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia wants the court to allow the state to use raw Census
2000 numbers for drawing new congressional districts without first
going to the Justice Department for approval, since the state falls
under Federal Voting Rights regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The case is being watched closely by supporters and opponents of
sampling as a benchmark in determining the constitutionality of
sampled data.

<HEADLINE> Ivana Trump sues Italian television show for $3 million  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Ivana Trump has filed a $3 million lawsuit
against a television station in Italy, alleging that employees of a
show on which she appeared dropped a large quantity of water on
her.
</P>
<P>
   Trump says in court papers that the dousing made her sick,
ruined her $3,000 dress and made her lose a pair of $25,000
earrings made by jeweler Harry Winston. She said she spent $400 on
emergency medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was not treated with respect on that show,'' said Trump's
lawyer, Dan Harrington. ''She's a nice lady. We're not going to let
them get away with that.'' He would not elaborate on the incident
or the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In papers filed Wednesday in Manhattan's State Supreme Court,
Trump said she was asked in June 1999 to appear in Italy on a
television program called ''Scherzi A Parte,'' a show similar to
''Candid Camera.''
</P>
<P>
   The show contacted Trump's agent, the William Morris Agency, and
sent the request along with the note from the show's producer,
Alessandra Cartanese, saying, ''I will be sending the story board
of the prank (joke) that could be done on her. Obviously she would
have to agree to it.''
</P>
<P>
   In July, Trump was told that the program's first story board, in
which a woman and a dog relieve themselves and a woman changes a
baby's diaper, was ''a little vulgar,'' so the producers had come
up with something else.
</P>
<P>
   After Trump approved a new sketch, the producers agreed to pay
her $18,000 for her TV appearance on July 8, 1999, to be aired
later. On July 6, Trump left New York for Italy on a flight paid
for by the television show.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the show, court papers say, while other guests
talked, ''loud sounds of thunder were heard'' and defendants
''caused water to be dropped from a high elevation onto plaintiff's
head and body.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump suffered ''bodily harm, shock, chills, nervousness, high
fever, nausea, embarrassment and severe emotional distress,'' court
papers say.
</P>
<P>
   Court papers say the show's producers deliberately lied to Trump
about what was supposed to happen on the show.
</P>
<P>
   ''Defendants intended to deceive and trick (Trump) into
appearing on their television show by giving (her) the appearance
that the show was to be professional and conducted in a manner
suited to the caliber and international status of Ivana Trump,''
the papers say.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, court papers say, the show's employees ''planned to
intentionally drop water onto (Trump) from a high elevation with
the purpose to shock and embarrass'' her so her reaction could be
captured on tape.
</P>
<P>
   Trump's lawsuit names the television company that produces the
show, RETI Televisive Italiane (RTI); Cartanese and another
individual associated with the show; and A.C. Promotions, a
productions and casting agency in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   A person at RTI's New York office said no one there could
comment on Trump's lawsuit. There was no answer at a phone at RTI's
offices in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit asks $1 million in general damages and $2 million in
punitive damages, as well as payment for Trump's ruined or lost
personal property.

<HEADLINE> Report: Pilot in fatal crash took medication for chronic migraines  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - The pilot of a small plane that crashed into
a Newark street last year was taking pain medication for migraines
that should have kept him from flying, a federal report said
Thursday. The pilot and three others were killed in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   National Transportation Safety Board investigators also
concluded that two of the plane's three gyroscopes weren't turning
at the time of the crash. Pilot Itzhak Jacoby, 56, of Bethesda,
Md., had reported gyroscope problems on the Beechcraft Bonanza S35
before crashing on Nov. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said that failed gyroscopes could have doomed the flight
that crashed into a factory and barreled down a street, shedding
its wings and tail before hitting a Kentucky Fried Chicken
restaurant. Twenty-five people were injured on the ground and the
plane caused more than $1 million in property damage.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB said Jacoby should not have been flying while taking
Fiorinal, a medication for migraines that contains the sedative
butalbital.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB report did not offer conclusions on whether the
gyroscope problem or Jacoby's use of Fiorinal caused the crash. A
final report listing a probable cause is expected within a month,
NTSB investigator David Muzio said.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that Jacoby had been taking Fiorinal since 1976
and had a history of severe migraines, but never mentioned headache
problems or taking prescription medication on applications for FAA
medical certification.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pilots cannot fly with anything that causes sedation,'' said
Neil Nadler, a senior aviation medical examiner from Parsippany who
awards medical certificates to Continental Airlines and private
pilots.
</P>
<P>
   If a pilot who took Fiorinal and had severe migraine headaches
applied for certification, ''I would not clear him,'' Nadler said.
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby, a retired National Institutes of Health scientist; his
wife, Gail, 50; and their 13-year-old daughter, Atira, were killed
when the plane crashed a few minutes after takeoff from Linden
Municipal Airport. The Jacobys were headed to Dulles International
Airport in Washington, D.C., after visiting family. Alfred Walker,
59, of Newark, died on Jan. 21 of injuries he sustained on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy found 2.84 milligrams per liter of butalbital in
Jacoby's urine. The sedative is found in Fiorinal. Butalbital is
''habit-forming and potentially abusable'' with side effects of
drowsiness and dizziness, according to the 1999 edition of the
Physician's Desk Reference.
</P>
<P>
   On July 16, 1989, the report said, Jacoby called a nurse on the
phone, told her he was suffering from severe migraines and asked
for a prescription refill that would last him until the next
morning. At that time, Jacoby was taking one Fiorinal every four to
six hours, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby was prescribed over 6,000 Fiorinal tablets between 1992
and October 1999, the NTSB said. A history of chronic migraine or
tension headaches would keep pilots from flying, according to the
FAA's 1999 guide for aviation medical examiners.
</P>
<P>
   The headaches often need medication to cure, ''and in most
instances, the use of such medications is disqualifying because
they may interfere with a pilot's alertness and functioning,'' the
guidelines state.
</P>
<P>
   Nadler said that lying on FAA medical application forms is
punishable by up to five years in federal prison.
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby held a commercial pilot certificate and had logged 5,800
hours of flight time, 120 hours in the last six months, the NTSB
said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators examined three gyroscopes, which help to balance
the plane and tell the pilot which direction it is heading and
whether it is pointing up or down. The gyroscope from the attitude
indicator was operating at the time of the crash, while the
horizontal-situation indicator's gyroscope was not, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   The turn coordinator's gyroscope, considered a backup, was not
working, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Gyroscope failure can render key cockpit indicators failure and
cause a plane to crash, said Drew Steketee, a spokesman for the
Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association in Frederick, Md.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is a very, very tough place to be,'' Steketee said.
''We've lost 747s due to instrument failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Steketee, who said he knew Jacoby for 10 years, said that Jacoby
had mentioned ''a slight problem'' with headaches in the past.

<HEADLINE> Another challenge brewing over representation of guards  </HEADLINE>
By HADLEY PAWLAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Some state prison guards say 14 months are
enough to show the incompetent and undemocratic nature of the
guards' new union, the state Correctional Officers &AMP; Police
Benevolent Association.
</P>
<P>
   NYSCOPBA said the claims by dissident guards are unfounded and
are cover for a scheme to reinstall Council 82 as the guards'
bargaining agent. NYSCOPBA took 20,000 of Council 82's members last
year after Council 82 served as the guards' union for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Corrections and Law Enforcement Union
announced the start of a petition drive calling for the
decertification of NYSCOPBA and for CLEU to take over that union's
bargaining responsibilities. Signatures by at least 30 percent of
the union's membership are needed to force a decertification vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''CLEU is not even recognized as a union,'' NYSCOPBA spokesman
Dennis Fitzpatrick said. ''It's a name put out there, but it's
really Council 82. A wolf in sheep's clothing.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They are trying to dupe membership,'' Fitzpatrick added.
''It's their way of rechallenging NYSCOPBA.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell Clemens, deputy administrator of Council 82, said CLEU
is not a front for Council 82.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not our way of rechallenging NYSCOPBA,'' Clemens said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a grass roots movement, period,'' said CLEU president
Bob White. ''There is no money, nobody behind this except the
officers of CLEU.''
</P>
<P>
   In April 1999, upstart NYSCOPBA won an election to replace
Council 82 as bargainer for state corrections officers, SUNY police
officers and state parks police officers. On the day of the vote,
two brooms were propped up against a wall in the Empire State Plaza
in Albany where votes were counted bearing signs saying ''Swept
clean'' and ''Good riddance to bad rubbish.''
</P>
<P>
   Council 82 retained the supervisors for state park police, SUNY
police, corrections lieutenants and some other security
supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   Council 82 had been criticized for accepting contracts patterned
after larger state employee unions like the Civil Service Employees
Association without taking into account the on-the-job dangers
faced corrections officers and other state security officers.
</P>
<P>
   Members also complained about the more than $2 million in
Council 82 dues that were taken each year by its parent union, the
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.
Council 82 also suffered from scandal - in 1995 AFSCME stepped in
to run the day-to-day operations of the union after top officials
were found to have used official funds for trips, meals and other
personal expenses.
</P>
<P>
   NYSCOPBA, independent from AFSCME, won over most of Council 82's
membership with promises to reject ''pattern bargaining,'' but some
disgruntled members claim that pledge has gone unfulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   They say the tentative agreement reached by NYSCOPBA in May is
too similar to the contract agreed upon by CSEA in March. The
schedule of pay raises in that proposed contract is the same as in
the CSEA contract, but adds law enforcement differentials that grow
from $125 a year to $575 over time.
</P>
<P>
   On May 30, union representatives from 11 prisons met to discuss
the tentative contract. Following the meeting, NYSCOPBA's
president, Brian Shanagher, sent memos to chief sector stewards
announcing the firing of four people who served as liaisons between
regional vice presidents and union officials at individual prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Shanagher said the four had been spreading ''negative and
inaccurate information about the tentative agreement,'' which
exposed the union to sanctions under state law.
</P>
<P>
   But the four have since been rehired, Fitzpatrick said, because
a ''litany of people'' went to NYSCOPBA's June 15-16 executive
assembly meeting with a ''mob mentality and overruled the chair to
rehire them.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It was all orchestrated as a spring board to their
challenge,'' Fitzpatrick said. ''They did it to energize the work
force out there.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The NYSCOPBA leaders have thwarted every attempt to make
NYSCOPBA more democratic and responsive to members,'' White
countered.
</P>
<P>
   If CLEU can get enough support, White said its first major
action will be to hold a constitutional convention at which
delegates would create the structure and schedule of elections for
the union.
</P>
<P>
   CLEU ''offers true democracy,'' White said.

<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A grand jury indicted an 18-year-old man on
Thursday in connection with the June 11 attacks on dozens of women
in Central Park, a spokeswoman for the Manhattan district attorney
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lonnie Hopson, of Queens, was indicted on charges of
first-degree sexual abuse and first-degree riot, said DA
spokeswoman Barbara Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   Hopson remains jailed on $10,000 bail, Thompson said. He is next
due in court on July 10.
</P>
<P>
   Nine men have been indicted by the grand jury in connection with
the assaults. Police have arrested 20 men in the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-three women have told police they were doused with water,
chased, stripped, molested or assaulted. Several others have
reported being victims of robberies or attempted robberies.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir has said police are conducting
an internal investigation into allegations that some officers
ignored victims' pleas for help. He warned that police officers
could be fired if investigators prove the allegations are true.

<HEADLINE> Gay man awarded $10 million in employment discrimination suit  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A Manhattan jury awarded $10.16 million Thursday
to a nightclub manager who charged that he was emotionally and
physically abused by the club's employees for months because he is
gay.
</P>
<P>
   The State Supreme Court jury found that managers of the Supper
Club on West 47th Street subjected Steven Minichiello, 42, to ''a
hostile or abusive work environment'' and then fired him because he
is homosexual.
</P>
<P>
   Minichiello sobbed uncontrollably and embraced his lawyer, Alan
Rich, when the jury announced its award. ''I feel blessed that the
jury saw that people shouldn't be treated like this,'' he said.
''It's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Now a manager at the Copacabana nightclub, Minichiello had been
manager since early 1992 of the Blue Room, a cabaret-type space
within the Supper Club. He says his troubles began in 1994 when a
new general manager arrived.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things the new boss, Andre Cortez, said to
Minichiello when he saw him was, ''I sure hope you're not working
for me,'' Rich told the jury in closing arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Cortez fired Minichiello on July 29, 1995, after several months
of anti-gay slurs, assaults in which he was forced to his knees and
his hair pulled, and threats to cut off his blond ponytail.
</P>
<P>
   Minichiello said he was told that cutting off the ponytail
''would make me look more like a man.''
</P>
<P>
   The defendants in the lawsuit are Cortez, the Supper Club, and
Oliver Hoffman, a partner and manager at the club.
</P>
<P>
   Nehemiah Glanc, the defendants' lawyer, told the jury in closing
arguments that it would have made no sense for the defendants to
keep Minichiello around as long as they did if they were
homophobes.
</P>
<P>
   Minichiello was an ''at will'' employee without a contract, and
club owners could have fired him anytime they wanted without legal
repercussions, Glanc argued. He said Minichiello left the club
because he wanted to.
</P>
<P>
   The jury deliberated about three hours before awarding
Minichiello $8 million for past pain and suffering $2 million for
future distress. The jury also gave him $160,000 for four years of
lost wages - from 1995 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the jury will resume deliberations on Minichiello's
request for punitive damages.

<HEADLINE> Hartford sergeant defends himself against sex-related charges  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - A Hartford police sergeant took the stand
in his federal corruption trial Thursday, telling a jury he did not
abuse two prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have the wrong man, and before the living God Jehovah I
did not do any of the crimes I'm charged with,'' Albert Beauchamp
testified.
</P>
<P>
   The government accuses Beauchamp of violating the civil rights
of the two women. Prosecutors claim that at various times,
Beauchamp took the prostitutes in his cruiser to secluded spots in
Hartford's South End, urinated in front of each of them, fondled
one of them, and during one incident, directing one of the women to
perform an erotic dance for a retiring captain.
</P>
<P>
   Beauchamp is one of six Hartford police officers indicted last
year on federal corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
   He is the first to go to trial. Four others have pleaded guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Beauchamp, 35, faces a maximum sentence of three years in prison
if convicted. He has been suspended from the force pending the
outcome of the case.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers, Whitman staff cobble $21.5B budget, up $270M since January </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Lawmakers and the Whitman administration
reached agreement Thursday on a $21.5 billion spending plan for the
new fiscal year beginning July 1.
</P>
<P>
   If approved intact as expected, the new budget when signed by
Gov. Christie Whitman will represent a 10-percent increase in
spending from the budget signed into law one year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed budget is up about $270 million from the $21.3
billion spending plan Whitman unveiled in January and gave to the
Legislature for consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the administration has sought about $154 million in
additional spending, according to spokesman Peter McDonough, most
of it to provide increased funds for poor and urban schools to
remain in compliance with a Supreme Court mandate.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the Legislature has inserted $123 million in
increases in state programs or for special projects, according to
Sen. Robert Littell, R-Sussex, the Senate budget committee
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Leonard Lance, R-Hunterdon, the chairman of the
Assembly budget committee, verified the numbers. He said his chief
priority for the fiscal 2000-2001 year had been to maintain an $850
million reserve, or ''surplus,'' which had been accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   In full numbers, the budget will be about $21.53 billion, up 1.3
percent from the $21.253 billion budget proposed in January and
10.3 percent from the $19.514 billion budget signed last June.
Earlier reports Thursday pegged the budget at closer to $21.6
billion but both McDonough and Littell said small parts had been
sliced out.
</P>
<P>
   The major components of the budget, such as more than $600
million for transportation projects, were not in dispute. Rather,
Senate and Assembly members were at odds with Treasury department
staff or each other over relatively small-ticket items being
changed or inserted into the spending plan.
</P>
<P>
   One member of the Senate budget committee, Joseph Kyrillos,
R-Monmouth, said, ''There are no big disputes over big things.
There are big disputes over little things.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonough said, ''I think they were within $50 million of each
other for the last 48 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Legislative staff continued working on the final budget
legislation into the night Thursday, since many last-minute changes
require myriad adjustments in mathematics and legal language. They
were not expected to have it finished and filed until after 3 a.m.
Friday, according to Rosemary Pramuk, chief budget analyst for the
Senate Republican staff.
</P>
<P>
   In what has become a bizarre annual ritual, the Legislature
actually remained in official session late into the night Thursday
even though all of the lawmakers had gone home by early evening.
</P>
<P>
   The empty Assembly and Senate were scheduled to remain in
session, technically speaking, until the dawn hours Friday to allow
introduction of a final budget bill with all of the numbers. This
odd step is necessary so that the budget can be put to a vote by
both houses next week and signed by the governor in time for the
June 30 deadline set in the state's constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Full text of the budget bill, including special add-on programs
for specific legislative districts or projects, will not be made
public until Friday.
</P>
<P>
   McDonough would not comment on which of these added programs
Whitman might delete with her unique line-item veto power. ''One
person's program is another person's pork,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Yanks, Tigers Near on Gonzalez Deal  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Yankees and Detroit Tigers were close to a
deal Thursday that could eventually bring outfielder Juan Gonzalez
to New York.
</P>
<P>
   There was no word of an agreement from either team, but progress
was confirmed to The Associated Press by two baseball lawyers who
spoke on the condition they not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   They did not say which players the Yankees would send to Detroit
for the two-time American League Most Valuable Player, who is
eligible for free agency after the season. If the teams agree to a
trade, the Yankees would have 72 hours to sign Gonzalez to a
contract extension, which would make the deal final.
</P>
<P>
   ''What deal?'' Gonzalez said in Toronto before the Tigers played
the Blue Jays. ''Rumors. There's lots of rumors. I'm going to talk
to my agent after the game.''
</P>
<P>
   A new contract figures to be a major obstacle for the Yankees.
After acquiring Gonzalez from Texas on Nov. 2 in a nine-player
trade, the Tigers attempted to sign him to an extension.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit was said to have offered a $140 million, eight-year
deal, which would be baseball's richest in total and average, but
Gonzalez was said to have wanted $148 million or more. The figures
have never been confirmed by the Tigers or Gonzalez's agents.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Tigers general manager Randy Smith nor Gonzalez's
agents, Jim Bronner and Bob Gilhooley, were available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as anything being close to happening, I don't know
anything more now than I did before,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre
said in Boston after lunching with owner George Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who have won three World Series titles in four
years, were just a half-game ahead of Boston in the AL East race
going into their game Thursday night at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   New York began the night ninth in the AL in home runs with 85
and sixth in batting average at .278.
</P>
<P>
   Left field and designated hitter have been major disappointments
for the Yankees, causing Steinbrenner to push for change. Ricky
Ledee was hitting .243 with six homers and 28 RBIs, and Shane
Spencer was batting .273 with nine homers and 31 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, 30-year-old right-handed hitter, also has struggled,
batting just .260 with 13 homers and 30 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   To get offense, New York has offered a variety of prospects in
its rich farm system, but the Yankees' proposal was unclear. New
York also has talked with the Chicago Cubs about Sammy Sosa, but
the Cubs have demanded nearly all the top prospects in New York's
system, one of the baseball lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Yankees officials have argued that instead of offense, New
York should concentrate its efforts on pitching. David Cone (1-6)
and Roger Clemens (4-6) have struggled, Clemens is on the disabled
list and Orlando Hernandez sprained an elbow last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at 4.43, the Yankees began the night with the league's
third-best ERA, trailing only Boston (3.95) and Chicago (4.34).
</P>
<P>
   Drew Henson, projected to be Michigan's starting quarterback
this fall, likely would be included in any deal. Henson is a
third-base prospect and was selected to play in baseball's
prestigious Futures game in Atlanta next month, but there's no
assurance he will choose baseball over football.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee, Spencer, infielder Alfonso Soriano and pitcher Jake
Westbrook, hit hard by the Chicago White Sox last weekend in his
major league debut, also are possibilities.

<HEADLINE> Three Share St. Jude Lead  </HEADLINE>
By TERESA M. WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- David Toms, David Peoples and Joe Ogilvie
shot 6-under-par 65s in near-perfect morning conditions Thursday to
share the first-round lead in the St. Jude Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Peoples had his lowest round this year, but missed a chance to
take sole possession of the lead when he three-putted from 15 feet
on his final hole.
</P>
<P>
   ''I probably did peek up there and saw I was the only one at 7
under, and there you go,'' said Peoples, calling his bogey on No. 9
a brain cramp after needing only 24 putts through 17 holes.
</P>
<P>
   Toms, who won twice last year, matched Peoples with seven
birdies and a bogey. Ogilvie had six birdies.
</P>
<P>
   Chris DiMarco, Notah Begay, Scott Hoch and Bob May opened with
66s on the TPC at Southwind course. Local favorite Loren Roberts,
Russ Cochran, Joe Durant, Steve Pate and Carl Paulson shots 67s.
</P>
<P>
   Only Hoch, May, Roberts and Cochran from the afternoon group
cracked the leaderboard, with DiMarco saying the conditions were
perfect in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wasn't too hot. No wind. The greens are just right: not too
fast, not too slow,'' DiMarco said. ''It's very receptive out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   With greens soft to keep them from dying in the heat, players
were able to shoot at the pins.
</P>
<P>
   Peoples hit 15 greens in regulation and grabbed his share of the
lead with four straight birdies to start his back nine. He started
the string by running in a 50-foot uphill putt and wrapped it up
with a couple of tap-in putts.
</P>
<P>
   His round could have been even better, but he missed a 7-footer
for birdie on No. 10 and a 6-footer on No. 13.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I can step my short game up a notch, I think I can get in
position to get a little more nervous,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ogilvie benefitted from a change in his putting stance. The man
who described himself as putting like Ray Charles worked on his
stance last week and now stands with his eyes directly over the
ball.
</P>
<P>
   He started his day by running in an 8-footer for birdie on No.
10, his longest birdie putt on a day where he needed only 26 putts.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was center cut. It was a while that I've had the ball on
line the entire time, hit the ball exactly where I wanted to, and
it was big. That was a big confidence booster straight off the
bat,'' said Ogilvie, who has missed the cut in four of his last
eight tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Toms birdied four of his first seven holes before running into
trouble on the par-4 17th. He hit a 4-iron off a cart path and
settled for his only bogey.
</P>
<P>
   After tying 16th last week in the U.S. Open where only Tiger
Woods broke par, Toms said he benefitted from a quick session with
his teacher to work a kink out of his swing.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 54 players broke par Thursday, and Peoples said it
wasn't a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think people got enough of watching us make bogeys last
week. I think they like watching guys stick shots in there close.
It's fun for the gallery. It's fun for me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Divots: John Restino withdrew after cutting his hand when a club
head snapped off on the 18th tee. ... John Daly, who withdrew from
the U.S. Open after finishing with a 14 on his final hole of the
first round, shot a 70. He used to live near the course. ... Bill
Glasson recorded the first double-eagle of his career on the
easiest hole on the course, the par-5, 527-yard No. 5. He used a
driver to hole a 260-yard shot.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Accuses Congo Government  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- A day after Congolese police shut down the
office overseeing peace talks, the U.N. Security Council on
Thursday accused the government of failing to cooperate in ending
the country's 18-month civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Police in the Congolese capital Kinshasa sealed the office
Wednesday of former Botswana president Ketumile Masire, who was
chosen in December by the warring parties to lead talks aimed at
establishing a broad-based government in the Central African
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Under a peace agreement, more than 5,500 U.N. observers are to
be stationed in Congo to supervise a cease-fire and the withdrawal
of foreign forces. So far, only 100 U.N. personnel have been
deployed because the cease-fire has been continually broken.
</P>
<P>
   Bangladesh's U.N. Ambassador Anwarul Chowdhury, a council
member, called the closing of Masire's office ''very serious.
</P>
<P>
   ''He initiates the inter-Congolese dialogue. Unless that takes
place, no peacekeeping effort will succeed,'' Chowdhury said.
</P>
<P>
   The peace agreement signed by Congolese President Laurent Kabila
calls for a neutral facilitator to organize talks among the warring
factions.
</P>
<P>
   But Kabila's government has accused Masire of bias and
repeatedly blocked his work. Earlier this month, the government
refused to attend preliminary talks organized by Masire and
prevented opposition politicians from going as well.
</P>
<P>
   Congolese government spokesman Didier Mumengi said Wednesday
that Kabila had lost confidence in Masire and wanted a new
mediator.
</P>
<P>
   But the Security Council and the United States want Masire back
on the job. And Salim Ahmed Salim, secretary general of the
Organization of African Unity, appealed to the Congolese president
to reconsider his decision and discuss his differences with Masire,
U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Closing Masire's office and banning him from Congo ''undermine
the prospects for regional peace and development,'' State
Department spokesman Philip T. Reeker said Thursday, ''and the
United States is reiterating our firm support for Masire, the
national dialogue and the Lusaka process.''
</P>
<P>
   Masire is widely respected for fostering economic development
and a stable democracy while serving four elected terms as
Botswana's president from 1980 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Security Council demanded the immediate
withdrawal of Rwandan and Ugandan forces from the Congo River port
of Kisangani, followed by the withdrawal of all foreign forces from
the country.
</P>
<P>
   The council said Thursday it was informed that more than 600
civilians had been killed and more than 3,000 wounded when Rwandan
and Ugandan troops turned their guns on each other earlier this
month in Kisangani. On Monday, the International Red Cross reported
518 deaths, including 319 civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Uganda announced Thursday it was withdrawing five battalions
from Congo.

<HEADLINE> Fish and Game Council approves black bear hunts in NJ  </HEADLINE>
AP Photo TN104-105
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - After a 20-year ban, black bear hunting
could be legal in New Jersey beginning this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Fish and Game Council voted unanimously Thursday
to allow the hunt, which is to begin in September, in an effort to
reduce the state's burgeoning bear population.
</P>
<P>
   ''No scientific studies have proved that contraception has an
effect on bears,'' Charles Suk, chairman of the council's Game
Committee, told The Times of Trenton. ''The only available
realistic method of reduction of bears is game hunting.''
</P>
<P>
   Two decades ago, there were less than 100 black bear in the
Garden State. Today, there are more than 1,000 in 11 of the state's
21 counties.
</P>
<P>
   In its vote, the council agreed to a suggestion by Gov. Christie
Whitman to reduce the number of bears killed to 175; the original
proposal called for a total of 350 bears in the first year's hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of many northern New Jersey communities complain that
the bears invade their back yards, kill their pets and scare their
children. Complaints of damage by black bears have soared from 285
in 1995 to 1,659 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say the bear population in residential areas has
grown in part because of residential development in former rural
areas. Hunting seasons in neighboring New York and Pennsylvania may
have also pushed bears to New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   State officials have tried ''aversion conditioning'' to scare
off bears with pepper spray or rubber buckshot and urged residents
not to feed the bears and to bring their garbage indoors at night.
</P>
<P>
   But animal rights activists say the bears are doing no harm.
Several activists, including one in a bear costume, attempted to
deliver petitions opposing the hunt to the Statehouse on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The hunt would be the first in New Jersey since 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Carr, a wildlife biologist, said the 11-member council
would make its decision based on the ''best available scientific
information'' and on public comment from a hearing held earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
   Carr said it is not the council's intention to eliminate black
bears.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our mission is to protect the black bear population, but we
want to reduce the density,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Senate committee on June 15 passed a bill that would ban bear
hunts in New Jersey. The full Senate will consider the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The Fish and Game Council requires no approval to order the bear
hunt. The arm of the state Division of Fish and Wildlife would have
to re-approve the hunt each year.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Fish and Game plan, hunting bears would be permitted -
until the target is reached - on Sept. 18 and Sept. 22; Sept. 30
through Oct. 27; and Dec. 4 through Dec. 9.

<HEADLINE> Police Battle Paraguay Protesters  </HEADLINE>
By PEDRO SERVIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) -- Riot police fired tear gas and
unleashed water cannons Thursday to disperse hundreds of workers on
a strike called by labor unions opposed to a government
privatization plan.
</P>
<P>
   At least 20 people were injured and dozens arrested, authorities
said, as thousands of transport and other union workers launched
the first of a two-day strike supported by three of the country's
four largest labor groups.
</P>
<P>
   Most stores and schools in downtown Asuncion and in Ciudad del
Este. Most public transportation ground to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   Union workers are incensed over a government plan to sell
railroad, water, and telephone systems to private parties. Approved
by the Senate in May, the plan is to be voted on by the lower house
on June 29.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the plan say putting the state-run businesses in
private hands could leave the jobs of some 15,000 people at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Persio Duarte, a labor leader, threatened more strikes if the
government didn't withdraw its plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''In some way we're going to take revenge against the
government,'' he told reporters. ''Not with acts of violence, but
with more strikes and protests that will disrupt this process of
privatization.''
</P>
<P>
   Government spokesman Jaime Bestard said the government would
allow the strikes to continue, but would not revoke its proposed
plan to privatize.
</P>
<P>
   ''The right of the unions to strike will be respected,'' he told
reporters. ''But the project to reform the state will not be
reversed. It's irreversible.''
</P>
<P>
   A protracted economic crisis has brought widespread discontent
with the government of President Luis Gonzalez Macchi, which has
struggled to rejuvenate Paraguay's stagnant economy.
</P>
<P>
   With per capita income just above dlrs 1,600 a year, some 22
percent of Paraguay's 5.4 million people live in poverty. The
unemployment rate hovers near 16 percent and 300,000 peasants in
the countryside are clamoring for land. Many people depend on
cash-strapped state enterprises for their livelihood.

<HEADLINE> More Testimony in Umpires Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Sandy Alderson, the new boss of baseball's
umpires, completed his testimony Thursday in the grievance
attempting to regain the jobs of 22 umps released last September.
</P>
<P>
   Alderson began his testimony during the first week of May and
was cross-examined Thursday by the Major League Umpires
Association, the union that represented umps before this season.
</P>
<P>
   He was followed to the stand by Robert Kheel, a longtime lawyer
for the National League who headed negotiations for the umpires'
old labor contract, which expired Dec. 31. Kheel was scheduled to
resume testifying Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The sides hope to complete testimony in the case by the end of
next week. There is no indication when arbitrator Alan Symonette
will make a decision.
</P>
<P>
   The 22, a group that includes Richie Garcia, Frank Pulli, Terry
Tata, Eric Gregg and Joe West, lost their jobs after a mass
resignation plan failed. The MLUA then filed a grievance, arguing
owners shouldn't have released the 22.
</P>
<P>
   During the offseason, umpires voted out the MLUA, which was
heavily supported by NL umps, and replaced it with the World
Umpires Association, which has the support of most AL umps.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, talks between the new union and owners appear to be
at a standstill. The terms of the expired contract have been
extended through June 30. After that, either side can give 14 days'
notice it intends a work stoppage.

<HEADLINE> Padres Set New Park Dimensions  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Dimensions for the San Diego Padres' new
downtown ballpark were approved by the commissioner's office, which
is allowing the center-field fence to be 396 feet, 4 feet shy of
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's shallow in some place and much deeper in other places,''
Padres spokesman Glenn Geffner said. ''No one knows how it will
play for sure. But the thought is that it'll be fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Padres president Larry Lucchino, who helped design Baltimore's
Camden Yards, received the approval letter Wednesday and released a
statement saying that intimacy will be key to the park's design.
The outfield wall will range from 4-12 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ''The 7-foot-high fence extends around most of the field,
allowing for spectacular, leaping, home run-robbing catches,''
Lucchino said. ''In the future, you may see some of baseball's most
dramatic, thrilling, and fascinating plays occur in San Diego's
little ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   Slight changes from the Padres' earlier plans were made to left
field, where the Western Metal Supply Co. Building stands. Instead
of meeting an open field, the building will be fenced off and balls
landing past the 4-foot high fence will be considered a home run.
</P>
<P>
   The outfield's staggered dimensions and wall heights, however,
remain largely untouched. The corner of the building will serve as
the left-foul pole and a ''Home Run Porch'' will protrude from the
right field.
</P>
<P>
   The deepest part of the park will be 411 feet in the
right-center alley. Straightaway right field will be kept deeper at
382 feet, because prevailing winds blow in that direction, and the
fence will rise 12 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The straightaway left field, however, will be 367 feet deep with
a wall 7-feet high.

<HEADLINE> Ray: 'Substantial evidence' of Hillary Clinton role in travel office firings </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Independent Counsel Robert Ray said Thursday
there is ''substantial evidence'' that Hillary Rodham Clinton
played a role in White House travel office firings, contrary to her
denials, but he won't bring charges against her.
</P>
<P>
   Ray said he could not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that ''any
of Mrs. Clinton's statements and testimony regarding her
involvement in the travel office firings were knowingly false.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The independent counsel has declined prosecution of Mrs.
Clinton,'' Ray said.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor also criticized the White House for what he
called ''substantial resistance'' to providing ''relevant
evidence'' to his investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ''The White House asserted unfounded privileges that were later
rejected in court,'' Ray said. ''White House officials also
conducted inadequate searches for documents and failed to make
timely production of documents, including relevant e-mails.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House issued a statement that accused the Independent
Counsel of politicizing an investigation that has ''dragged on far
too long'' by ''inappropriately characterizing the results of a
legally sealed report through innuendo.''
</P>
<P>
   ''After seven years and the expense of tens of millions of
taxpayer dollars, the Independent Counsel confirms what we have
said all along: There is no evidence that the first lady did
anything wrong. In fact, the Independent Counsel confirms what the
president and first lady have always said about this matter,''
White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's decision came on the same day that government officials
said a top Justice Department had recommended that a special
counsel be appointed to investigate Vice President Al Gore in the
1996 campaign fund-raising controversy. The recommendation came
from Robert Conrad, supervising attorney for the Justice Department
task force investigating 1996 fund-raising abuses, according to
officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Ray issued the statement about the first lady after closing out
the investigation into the 1993 firings of all seven employees of
the White House travel office, which spurred one of the first major
controversies of President Clinton's tenure.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes less than six months before the election.
Mrs. Clinton is seeking to become a U.S. senator from New York.
</P>
<P>
   When Ray recently announced the closing of the FBI files
investigation, he praised the White House for cooperation and
emphasized there was no ''substantial'' evidence of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   But in Thursday's statement, Ray challenged the veracity of Mrs.
Clinton's account of the firings. She has repeatedly stated she did
not play a role in them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mrs. Clinton does not know the origin of the decision to
remove the White House travel office employees,'' her lawyers told
congressional auditors in 1994. ''Mrs. Clinton did not direct that
any action be taken.'' In 1996, Mrs. Clinton swore to Congress that
the earlier answers ''were accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray noted that Mrs. Clinton ''had discussions with Deputy White
House Counsel Vince Foster, Chief of Staff Mack McLarty and
longtime friend and adviser Harry Thomason.'' Ray also called
attention to a phone conversation she had with David Watkins, then
the White House administration chief.
</P>
<P>
   Those contacts have been known since the White House's original
review of the firings in 1993. However, Ray concluded the contacts
''ultimately influenced Watkins' decision to fire the travel office
employees.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Nevertheless, the evidence was insufficient to prove to a jury
beyond a reasonable doubt that any of Mrs. Clinton's statements and
testimony regarding her involvement in the travel office firings
were knowingly false,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House travel office workers who were fired served at
the pleasure of the president and could have been terminated
without any reason. But a White House lawyer who worked for Foster
contacted the FBI to pass along rumors of financial improprieties
before the workers were fired.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans accused the White House of using the FBI to justify
the firings.
</P>
<P>
   Foster later committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The White House conducted an internal review and issued a public
apology, saying the firings had been mishandled. It also
reprimanded four presidential aides while recommending that five of
the seven former employees be given new government jobs. The former
head of the office was prosecuted and acquitted of financial
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's predecessor, Kenneth Starr, zeroed in on the travel office
in January 1996 when a memo by Watkins surfaced stating that Mrs.
Clinton had been behind the firings.
</P>
<P>
   A year and a half earlier, Mrs. Clinton had denied ordering the
dismissals in written answers a White House lawyer submitted on her
behalf to the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''We ... knew that there would be hell to pay if ... we failed
to take swift and decisive action in conformity with the first
lady's wishes,'' Watkins wrote in his unaddressed memo, adding that
he had been ''as protective and vague as possible'' in his own
answers to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once this made it onto the first lady's agenda, Vince Foster
became involved, and he'' and ''Thomason regularly informed me of
her ... insistence that the situation be resolved immediately by
replacing the travel office staff,'' Watkins wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton continued to insist she didn't direct the firings.
''I had no decision-making role with regard to the removal,'' Mrs.
Clinton said in written answers to Congress in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Astros' Powell Goes To DL  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Houston Astros right-handed reliever Jay Powell
was placed on the 15-day disabled list, retroactive to Monday, with
tendinitis in his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, 1-1 with a 4.70 ERA in 23 innings over 26 games, was on
the DL with the same ailment from May 17 through June 3.
</P>
<P>
   Since returning, he was 1-0 in 4 2-3 innings of four games,
giving up five hits and four runs.
</P>
<P>
   He last pitched Sunday at San Francisco. On Tuesday, he
attempted to warm up before the game at Enron Field with the
Dodgers, but complained of pain in his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Mike Maddux was activated from the DL to replace
Powell. Maddux missed 29 games since going on the DL May 21 with a
strained right groin.
</P>
<P>
   He is 2-2 with a 5.48 ERA in 18 appearances.

<HEADLINE> Cards' Orosco Encouraged  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Jesse Orosco might not have to go on the
disabled list, after all.
</P>
<P>
   The 43-year-old St. Louis Cardinals reliever had swelling in his
elbow after his outing Wednesday night. But on Thursday, he said it
felt much better.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll treat it, get some ice, and see how it goes,'' Orosco
said. ''I've just got a little swelling in there, and we'll see if
it goes down.''
</P>
<P>
   Orosco has made two appearances since he was activated June 9.
He's first on the career list with 1,096 games.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Walt Jocketty said trainers didn't think the
injury was serious. Orosco said the elbow didn't hurt until after
he finished pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's never been hurt before, so he doesn't know how to act,''
Jocketty said. ''He'll take a few days off and we'll see how it
goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Orosco said it was strange to be having problems after a long,
mostly injury-free career.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're talking 22 years of pitching and nothing's ever
happened,'' Orosco said. ''This all of a sudden bit me. Hopefully,
as the season goes on that will improve and maybe I can come back
to throwing back-to-back days.''

<HEADLINE> Lazio: SEC has launched informal probe of my stock trades  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Blasting the Clinton administration, U.S.
Senate candidate Rick Lazio said Thursday the Securities and
Exchange Commission has launched an ''informal investigation'' into
his stock option trading.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman from Long Island is running for the Senate in
New York against Hillary Rodham Clinton. Lazio has denied any
wrongdoing in connection with his stock dealings.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Lazio said he had ''received a request from the
staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission that we provide
them with copies of certain account statements and trading records.
</P>
<P>
   ''I intend to provide all information requested as well as
answer any questions that the staff may have,'' Lazio added.
</P>
<P>
   While Lazio talked cooperation, his campaign staff went on the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Clinton administration has a long history of abusing
federal authority and using government bureaucracies to attack
their political opponents,'' Lazio campaign manager Bill Dal Col
said in a statement. ''Today, they reached a new low.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate comment from the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson said, ''Desperate
candidates make desperate charges.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, state Comptroller H. Carl McCall, a Clinton
supporter, said he had written to SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr.
asking for an investigation of Lazio's stock option trading.
</P>
<P>
   McCall, the sole trustee of New York's more than $127 billion
public pension fund, called for the probe after it came out that
Lazio scored a nearly 600 percent profit trading on options for
stock in a company headed by political supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio campaign spokesman Dan McLagan said that on Thursday
members of the news media were told about the SEC's informal
investigation by federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, independent counsel Robert Ray said he had found
substantial evidence of involvement on the part of the first lady
in the White House travel office firings, but insufficient evidence
to indict her on perjury charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that a bogus investigation, launched at the behest of
a Hillary Clinton supporter, carried out and leaked to the media by
a federal government agency, occurred on the day that substantial
evidence about her involvement in the 'Travelgate' scandal began to
come out, does not pass the political sniff test,'' Dal Col said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that federal employees apparently leaked word of this
investigation, thus committing a felony and risking their very
freedom, speaks volumes of how far Hillary Clinton will go to
further her political career,'' Dal Col added.
</P>
<P>
   Statements of support, and outrage, came quickly from Lazio
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's more than outrageous, it's borderline illegal,'' Rep.
Thomas Reynolds, a western New York Republican, said.
</P>
<P>
   ''For eight years, We've suffered through scandal after scandal
in the Clinton-Gore administration and now Mrs. Clinton is bringing
her dirty laundry and Arkansas tactics to New York,'' said state
GOP Chairman William Powers.
</P>
<P>
   Records show that Lazio spent about $2,300 in early August 1997
for options on stock of Quick &AMP; Reilly, a brokerage firm. On Sept.
17, 1997, the firm was bought by the Fleet Financial Group. Lazio
sold his stock options that same day for almost $16,000.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Quick and Christopher C. Quick, former senior executives
of Quick &AMP; Reilly, who along with other company executives have
donated at least $35,000 to Lazio's campaigns since 1995, said they
had never discussed the company's stock with Lazio. Lazio also
denied any insider knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady has also faced questions about her financial
investments.
</P>
<P>
   She turned a $1,000 investment in the cattle futures market into
nearly $100,000 during a nine-month period in 1978 and 1979, when
her husband was attorney general and then governor of Arkansas. She
denied any wrongdoing in those transactions. She was assisted in
her trades by an executive of Tyson Foods, which had extensive
business before Arkansas state regulators.

<HEADLINE> Caddie back at Cadillac NFL Classic despite cancer  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLIFTON, N.J. (AP) - As long as Brian Deasy caddies on the PGA
Senior Tour, the pin incident on the next-to-last hole of the 1998
Cadillac NFL Classic is going to follow him.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow caddies and pros still tease the 39-year-old about the
mistake which almost cost Bob Dickson the championship.
</P>
<P>
   It's good-natured, and Deasy smiles a lot telling the story
about how he left the pin in on the par-3, 17th hole as Dickson was
attempting a 60-foot birdie putt while battling Jim Colbert and
Larry Nelson for the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Had the putt hit the pin, it would have been a disastrous
two-stroke penalty and Dickson's 25-year victory drought never
would have ended two holes later in a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to make any excuses,'' said Deasy, who was
working that week because Dickson's regular caddie, Mark Bolick,
needed the week off and Deasy's regular boss, Vincente Fernandez,
was skipping the tournament. ''I choked.''
</P>
<P>
   The way Deasy sees it, the incident happened for a reason. He
doesn't know why. He just accepts it.
</P>
<P>
   It the same approach he's taken since three months later in 1998
when he felt a lump on the side of his neck while watching
television in a hotel in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a month later, doctors gave him the diagnosis. He had
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a slow-spreading cancer, and it had been
found in his lymph system and bone marrow.
</P>
<P>
   After being examined at home in Clifton Park, N.Y., Deasy went
to two of the nation's top facilities that treat cancer. Doctors at
Dana Farber in Boston have given him 12 years to live. The experts
at Sloan Kettering in New York City give him eight.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe with technology, with the hopes of maybe finding
ways to treat what I have, that there is a good chance I can live a
lot longer,'' Deasy said Thursday on the eve of this year's
Cadillac NFL Golf Classic, his first return to the course since
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''I also have a tremendous attitude in the fact that I am not
going to give in to this thing,'' Deasy said. ''I'm not just going
to feel sorry for myself and dwell on the negatives. I stay real
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Deasy, who grew up in Glen Cove on Long Island and started
caddying at Piping Rock at the age of 12, undergoes blood work
every 12 weeks and CAT scans every six months. His cancer is not in
remission and the last CAT scan he took showed that a couple of
lymph nodes had gotten a little bigger.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Deasy has not taken either chemotherapy or radiation,
but knows he might need it soon.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could be a year from now, it could be five years or 10
years, you never know,'' said Deasy, who went to Sloan-Kettering on
Wednesday for more tests. ''It all depends on how my illness
progresses.''
</P>
<P>
   While admitting to some fear and nervousness, Deasy said the
cancer is not dominating his life.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, he took Fernandez out to the 17th hole and the two
recreated the scene from 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Deasy showed Fernandez where the pin placement was and where
Dickson's ball was and they talked about how the shadows made it
hard to see the pin.
</P>
<P>
   ''I even said to Vincente as a goof the first time we play the
hole this year I'll just leave the pin and say, 'Have someone tend
it' as a goof,'' Deasy said.
</P>
<P>
   Deasy said the problem in 1998 was that when he normally reads a
putt, he takes the pin out and carries it back to where his pro is
lining up the putt. Because of the shadows, Dickson told him to put
the pin back in as they were making the read.
</P>
<P>
   ''I stepped to the right and Dickson got up and hit the putt
almost immediately,'' Deasy said. ''If Jim Colbert didn't say
something after the putt, neither one of us would have known the
pin was still in.''
</P>
<P>
   It's made for a great story for the last two years wherever
Deasy has gone on the senior tour. It's a story he would like to
tell for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will not give into this thing,'' Deasy said. ''I just won't.
Another thing that has changed in my life is when I hear about
cancer it has so much more meaning because I have it. I can
understand what people are going through.
</P>
<P>
   ''It might sound crazy, but getting the cancer, a lot of
positive things have come out of this. I'm very grateful for a lot
of things, my wife, my friends. I'm a very lucky person to do what
I do for a living.''

<HEADLINE> Geddes Has Good Day in LPGA  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG FERGUSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- A perfect shot was part of a perfect day
for Jane Geddes, the leader after the first round of the LPGA
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Geddes made her third career hole-in-one, a 6-iron from 158
yards, and birdied her final two holes for a 5-under-par 66 on
Thursday and a two-stroke lead over some of the biggest names in
women's golf.
</P>
<P>
   Karrie Webb wasn't among them.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old Australian, trying to win the second leg of the
Grand Slam and her third consecutive major championship, struggled
on the thick, wet rough and smooth, fast greens at DuPont Country
Club for a 1-over 72.
</P>
<P>
   ''I came here with a goal to have fun,'' said Geddes, who won
the LPGA Championship in 1987 but hasn't won anything since 1994.
''I had a ball today.''
</P>
<P>
   She also had very few expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The dirt on Geddes' clubs was not from extra practice, but her
last tournament three weeks ago. Her mind was 3,000 miles away at
home in San Diego on a startup Internet company she recently
founded, an escape from 18 years of professional golf.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been putting a lot of pressure on myself,'' she said.
''I've been busy trying to figure out how to make a transition from
this life to that one. This may be my last day to lead a major, and
I'm out there thinking, 'Enjoy this day.'
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no expectations right now. That might be the best way
to go play.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those chasing Geddes were Pat Bradley and Betsy King, two
members of the Hall of Fame, along with Tracy Hanson and Gloria
Park.
</P>
<P>
   Like Geddes, Bradley has not exactly been dialed in to golf. The
only reason she studies a leaderboard these days is to scout
potential players for the Solheim Cup team she will captain in
October.
</P>
<P>
   It was a mild shock to see her name up there.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've kept one eye on my game and one eye on some of my
players,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It's best not to lose track of DuPont Country Club, which is
much more difficult than recent years because of the thicker rough
and greens that measured just under 11 on the Stimpmeter, the
quickest they will see all year except for the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Starting on the back nine, Geddes got off to a bad start --
partly because she was 1 over, and partly because she was as tense
as ever. Her caddie reminder her of the pledge to have fun, and
that seemed to set her loose.
</P>
<P>
   After a birdie got her back to even, Geddes' 6-iron on the 17th
took two hops and rolled in for an ace. She closed out her round by
hitting a sand wedge from a divot in the 18th fairway to 6 feet for
her fifth birdie of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Patty Sheehan helped carry the cause for the 40-and-over crowd
with a 2-under 69 and was tied with Wendy Ward, Wendy Doolan and
A.J. Eathorne of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Another stroke back were Annika Sorenstam and Laura Davies, a
two-time winner of the LPGA Championship, which is sponsored by
McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont is one of the few courses on tour where the Englishwoman
has no problem hitting driver and taking advantage of her superior
length. Davies made six birdies, but also picked up five bogeys by
failing to negotiate the mesh-like rough around the greens.
</P>
<P>
   ''I made it look more difficult than it was,'' Davies said.
</P>
<P>
   Dottie Pepper felt the same way, especially after taking a
double-bogey on her par-5 closing hole for an even-par 71. A stiff
breeze changed direction, into her face, and Pepper decided to hit
driver instead of 3-wood. The ball clipped the last branch down the
right side and dropped into the hazard.
</P>
<P>
   ''I managed my away around pretty good,'' Pepper said. ''I just
haven't done very well getting the horse into the barn.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb has never gotten off to a blazing start in the LPGA
Championship. She rarely gave herself enough good looks at a
birdie, and now needs a solid round on Friday to keep from falling
too far behind.
</P>
<P>
   Also at 72 was defending champion Juli Inkster.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just didn't have a very good round. I didn't hit many
greens,'' said Webb, who has finished out of the top 10 just once
this year. ''It could have been a lot worse today.''
</P>
<P>
   For Geddes, nothing could have been better.
</P>
<P>
   Her Internet company is called Planesia.com, part of what she
calls the ''e-tailing craze.'' The company has 27 employees and is
moving into a new office this week. Those are just some of the
distractions Geddes is dealing with, but a first-round lead in a
major championship helped get her mind off that second career.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would just be over the top ... for me to win another major
right now,'' Geddes said.
</P>
<P>
Divots: The greens at DuPont were rebuilt last year and are faster
than ever. But the practice green was left alone, and several
players said they had a hard time adjusting to the difference in
the speed early in the round. ... Christie Kerr, who was tied for
the 54-hole lead before finishing fifth last year, withdrew because
of the flu. ... Fifty-two players in the field spent last week in
France for the Evian Masters. ''It was such a beautiful place that
I would put up with a little jet lag to go over there,'' Inkster
said. ... Cathy Gerring is playing in her first LPGA Championship
since she was severely burned in a freak fire incident at the 1992
Sara Lee Classic. She had a 77.

<HEADLINE> Yanks' Knoblauch Has Another Error  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- New York Yankees second baseman Chuck Knoblauch,
who has had trouble making the short throw to first base, made
another error on Thursday night -- his 14th of the season and his
fifth in eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Offerman hit a fourth-inning grounder to Knoblauch, who
fielded it cleanly but threw well wide of first baseman Tino
Martinez. The ball rolled all the way to the wall behind home
plate, and Offerman went to second as the Boston crowd taunted
Knoblauch.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch was a Gold Glove winner in 1997, but his defense has
deteriorated since then -- especially on the seemingly simple throw
to first.
</P>
<P>
   The three previous batters all grounded the ball to Knoblauch,
but he made those plays without incident.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers work quickly to repeal automatic mini-hike in gasoline tax </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The Assembly Appropriations Committee voted
Thursday to kill an automatic increase in taxes on gasoline before
it can take effect in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The increase would be so tiny as to be scarcely noticeable at
first, but lawmakers regarded the very idea of it to be annoying
and needless at a time when high gasoline prices are capturing
headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats voted for the repeal unanimously, and
similar outcomes are expected next week in the full Assembly and in
the Senate. Gov. Christie Whitman has promised a quick signature.
</P>
<P>
   Now the only drama is time: The bill must get through both
houses in the next five working days in order to prevent the July 1
rate hike from taking effect.
</P>
<P>
   For most motorists, the rate hike would increase what they pay
for gasoline by only 1 cent on every 10 gallons of gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   But because the tax is designed to collect 2.75 percent of
wholesale petroleum-product revenues, it could continue creeping
upward if the price of gas were to continue increasing.
</P>
<P>
   Should gasoline prices in New Jersey hit $2 a gallon, as they
have in the Chicago region, the increase would be 1.5 cents per
gallon.
</P>
<P>
   The tax increase has its root in a 1991 law creating a new tax
on wholesale petroleum products, everything from home heating oil
to engine lubricants, at a rate of 2.75 percent of gross receipts.
</P>
<P>
   To simplify calculating this tax for gasoline sales, the rate
was locked in at 4 cents per gallon provided that 4 cents remained
adequate to collect this minimum of 2.75 percent. When prices
dropped, the 4-cent rate did not drop along with them.
</P>
<P>
   ''They clearly intended it to be a floating thing. Of course, it
floated only up,'' said Assemblyman Richard Bagger, R-Union,
chairman of the Appropriations committee and sponsor of the bill,
A-2522, to repeal the tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   ''The price has dropped since 1991 and only now has exceeded
($1.44) again, so the built-in escalator in the 1991 law is now
relevant for the first time,'' Bagger said. ''It had sort of been
forgotten that was done 10 years ago and now it needs to be
adjusted before July 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said the obscure adjustment built into the 1991 law was
''a stealth tax increase.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll sign the repeal the minute it hits my desk, but it needs
to get here in a hurry,'' Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   Bagger said he was pleased but puzzled by the governor's
enthusiasm because he said she could kill the tax increase
immediately by signing an executive order. ''We can't sign
executive orders in the Legislature, we can only pass bills,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The wholesale gasoline tax at issue is entirely separate from
the state's standard gasoline tax of 10.5 cents per gallon, which
is not being changed and would not be subject to any automatic
adjustments.

   HAVANA (AP) -- In the latest indication of Cuba's growing tourism
sector, Japan Airlines plans to send five flights of Japanese
visitors to the Caribbean island in August, the official news
agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Prensa Latina didn't say whether the flights were a one-time
promotion or would be followed by regular charter or scheduled
service from Japan.
</P>

   Cuba projects close to 2 million tourists this year, up from 1.6
million last year. Tourism produced $1.3 billion in foreign

<HEADLINE> State appeals federal approval of New Jersey pipeline  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The state Attorney General's Office on
Thursday filed an appeal challenging a federal decision to allow
expansion of a natural gas pipeline in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in April approved a
plan to let Houston-based Transcontinental Gas Pipeline Corp. add
91 miles of pipeline in 10 New Jersey counties.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General John J. Farmer said Thursday that an appeal was
filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman said the state's argument will be, in
part, that the regulatory commission has failed to properly address
the safety of the proposed pipeline and failed to protect the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, U.S. Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr., D-N.J., filed a
petition with the U.S. Court of Appeals asking the court to review
the regulatory commission's approval.
</P>
<P>
   Transco maintains that the new pipelines are needed because
their existing network is at 100 percent of capacity and the
company anticipates the increased use of natural gas to fuel power
plants in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Transco says its extension would expand along the paths of
existing pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   The pipeline would go through 31 municipalities in 10 New Jersey
counties - Bergen, Burlington, Essex, Hunterdon, Middlesex, Morris,
Passaic, Somerset, Union and Warren.
</P>
<P>
   The plan has generated local opposition. Homeowners,
environmental experts and politicians have said the project isn't
necessary, threatens wetlands and might pose a safety risk in
densely populated areas.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey officials have been wary of gas pipelines since a gas
explosion leveled much of an Edison apartment complex in 1994,
injuring more than 100 people and forcing 1,000 residents to flee.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer said that because of the specialized nature of federal
energy regulation, the Washington, D.C., law firm of Crowell &AMP;
Moring, which has experience on issues relating to the natural gas
regulatory process, will represent the state.

<HEADLINE> Hentrich, Kinchen Leading Classic  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLIFTON, N.J. (AP) -- Tennessee punter Craig Hentrich shot a
3-under-par 69 on Thursday to share the second-round lead with
Carolina tight end Brian Kinchen in NFL players' portion of the
Cadillac NFL Golf Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Kinchen, a three-time runner-up, had a 71 to match Hentrich at
3-over 147 on the Upper Montclair Golf Club course.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee kicker Al Del Greco, the defending champion and
five-time winner, was a stroke back along with Carolina fullback
Chris Hetherington. Del Greco, who also won in 1993, '94, '95, '96,
had his second straight 74. Hetherington ballooned to a 78, eight
shots more than his first round.
</P>
<P>
   The low 26 players in the 56-man field advanced to Friday's
third round, where scoring starts over. The low 12 players Friday
will advance to the final round Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterbacks Casey Weldon (153), Shane Matthews (154) and Glenn
Foley (155) were the next closest after 36 holes.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco wide receiver Jerry Rice (156) qualified for
Friday's play, but withdraw because of personal reasons, allowing
former New York Giants cornerback Phillippi Sparks (169) to make
the cut.

<HEADLINE> Dozens Arrested at Vieques Range  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Guards arrested 63 people inside
the Navy's Vieques island training ground Thursday, during a
protest against plans to resume bombing exercises.
</P>
<P>
   Three journalists among the group have been released, but the
remaining 60 are in a federal prison near San Juan because they
have been refusing to identify themselves so that they can be cited
for trespassing, Navy spokesman Robert Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Activist Robert Rabin said those detained, including labor and
religious leaders and fishermen, were protesting Navy plans to
stage the largest training on Vieques since a fatal bombing
accident last year.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Saturday, ships and warplanes attached to the USS
George Washington Battle Group are expected to practice bombing and
shelling on the range using inert weapons, according to a Navy
notice.
</P>
<P>
   The exercise is expected to run for two to five days and would
be the largest since a civilian security guard was killed by two
500-pound bombs on the range in April 1999, sparking widespread
protests.
</P>
<P>
   Vieques islanders blame five decades of bombing for
environmental damage, stunted tourism, and what they say is a high
cancer rate. After the accident, protesters occupied the bombing
range until federal officials evicted them last month.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 protesters have since been arrested for
trespassing, Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of U.S. religious groups, including the National Council
of Churches and the United Church of Christ, have denounced the
planned bombing and urged President Clinton to cancel it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has ordered the Navy to use dummy bombs instead of live
munitions and to abandon Vieques by May 2003 if the island's 9,400
residents vote to expel it in a referendum expected next year. If
the Navy wins, it gets to use live munitions again.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy argues Vieques is the only place its Atlantic fleet can
hold simultaneous land, air and sea exercises using live fire
before deploying abroad -- training it says saves countless lives.

<HEADLINE> Mixed verdict for ex-Atlantic City officer accused in videotaped beating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MAYS LANDING, N.J. (AP) - A former police officer caught on tape
beating a suspect was cleared in the beating Thursday but convicted
of lying about it.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas DiLorenzo, 33, was charged in the 1998 beating of a fan
at a Van Halen concert at Trump Marina Hotel Casino. Jack Hagopian,
21, of Havertown, Pa., was arrested after security guards saw him
light up a marijuana cigarette in the casino.
</P>
<P>
   The beating was captured on a black-and-white videotape made by
a surveillance camera in the casino holding cell where Hagopian was
taken by guards.
</P>
<P>
   On it, DiLorenzo could be seen punching, kicking and kneeing
Hagopian in the back as he and two guards struggled to handcuff the
6-foot-3-inch, 150-pound suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors called it excessive use of force; DiLorenzo said he
was defending himself and attempting to get Hagopian handcuffed so
the suspect couldn't hurt him.
</P>
<P>
   After 12 hours of deliberations over three days, a Superior
Court jury acquitted DiLorenzo of two counts of aggravated assault
and one count of official misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   He was convicted of filing a false police report, false swearing
and two counts of official misconduct. He could face 10 years in
prison. Superior Court Judge Manuel Greenberg set sentencing for
Aug. 4.
</P>
<P>
   DiLorenzo left court without comment. His lawyer, calling the
verdicts inconsistent, said an appeal would be filed.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Assistant Atlantic County Prosecutor James McClain called
the mixed verdict a victory for the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's definitely a victory. We're disappointed that the counts
relating to the assault didn't get favorable verdicts. But we're
pleased the jury recognized the accuracy of the other counts,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hagopian, who was not seriously hurt in the beating,
successfully sued the Police Department over it. He did not return
a telephone call seeking comment on the verdict Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Americans OK Organ Donation  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- One in four Americans say they would consider
donating a kidney to a stranger while still alive, according to a
national survey paid for by the National Kidney Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   That number may exaggerate the actual potential of living organ
donation, experts say, but there's no question that more and more
Americans are giving up a kidney, and increasingly, a piece of
their liver. The rise is fueled by the acute shortage in organs
from people who have died and improved medical techniques.
</P>
<P>
   The kidney foundation survey, released Thursday, found
widespread interest in the living donation, with 90 percent of
American adults saying they would consider donating a kidney or a
part of another organ to a family member.
</P>
<P>
   Half of those surveyed said they'd consider it for a friend, and
one in four said they'd consider it for a stranger.
</P>
<P>
   There were 4,627 living donors last year, a 7 percent increase
in living donations over 1998. While the vast majority of donors
gave up a kidney, the number of living liver donations tripled last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Donations from people who died -- known as cadaveric donors --
remained virtually unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the increase in living donation is from donors not
related to the patient, with these donations tripling between 1989
and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''It first started with just brothers and sisters, and then
parents and children, and then it started branching out to spouses.
This is almost the next step,'' said Ellie Schlam, a spokeswoman
for the National Kidney Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Brewer, 52, heard at church that a woman needed a new
kidney and decided to get tested to be a donor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got to talking to my wife and I said I can't let her suffer
like that,'' said Brewer, a meter reader for the gas company in
Whiteford, Md.
</P>
<P>
   He was particularly struck that the woman in need, Joyce Thomas,
was 42 years old and the mother of two sons -- Brewer's mother was
the same age when she died of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said the boys aren't going to be without a mother if I have
anything to do with it,'' Brewer said.
</P>
<P>
   The surgery was in 1995 and both Thomas and Brewer are in good
health.
</P>
<P>
   However, while many people say they are interested in donation,
that doesn't necessarily translate into actual donation.
</P>
<P>
   Large numbers of people tell pollsters they would like to be an
organ donor if they died, and yet only half of the families asked
to donate their loved one's organs say yes.
</P>
<P>
   ''People don't want to appear negative in the eyes of the person
asking the question,'' said David Fleming, executive director of
the Coalition on Donation, which promotes organ donation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Fleming said, increased interest in living donation is
real. About a year ago, he said, his organization began receiving
calls from people interested in donating to strangers who needed
organs. The group now receives between 12 and 15 such calls each
month
</P>
<P>
   ''Random people calling and saying 'I'd like more information
about it,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The kidney foundation's survey of 1,000 adults was conducted in
January and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage
points.

<HEADLINE> Report: Pilot Was On Medication  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- The pilot of a small plane that crashed on a
neighborhood street last year was taking medication for migraines
that should have kept him from flying, a federal report said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   National Transportation Safety Board investigators also said
that two of the plane's three gyroscopes, which help the pilot to
balance and direct the plane, weren't functioning.
</P>
<P>
   The Beechcraft Bonanza S35 crashed into a factory and barreled
down a Newark street, shedding its wings and tail before hitting a
restaurant Nov. 26. Pilot Itzhak Jacoby, 56, of Bethesda, Md., his
wife and daughter and one person on the ground were killed, and 25
people on the ground were injured.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB report did not conclude whether the gyroscope problem
or Jacoby's use of Fiorinal caused the crash. A final report
listing a probable cause is expected within a month, NTSB
investigator David Muzio said.
</P>
<P>
   The report said Jacoby had taken Fiorinal, a migraine pain
medication that contains the sedative butalbital, since 1976 and
had a history of severe migraines. The FAA said Jacoby's
application for FAA medical certification did not list headache
problems or prescription medication for them.
</P>
<P>
   A history of chronic migraine or tension headaches would keep
pilots from flying, according to the FAA's 1999 guide for aviation
medical examiners.
</P>
<P>
   The headaches often need medication to cure, ''and in most
instances, the use of such medications is disqualifying because
they may interfere with a pilot's alertness and functioning,'' the
guidelines state.

<HEADLINE> Arthritis Drugs Tested Head-to-Head  </HEADLINE>
By PHIL GALEWITZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The results of the first head-to-head studies of
two blockbuster arthritis pain drugs -- paid for by the
pharmaceutical companies -- produced a split decision on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Merck &AMP; Co., which makes the arthritis drug Vioxx, said its pill
was better at reducing pain at night and during rest compared to
Pharmacia Corp.'s arthritis drug Celebrex.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacia countered that its studies found Vioxx was more likely
to increase high blood pressure and edema, a condition associated
with swelling in the legs. Pharmacia also said its studies found no
difference in how both drugs reduce pain.
</P>
<P>
   The companies presented the findings at a medical meeting in
Nice, France.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrex and Vioxx, both introduced last year in the United
States, are the first of a new class of painkillers to reduce pain
as well as older drugs but with the promise of less side effects
such as ulcers.
</P>
<P>
   Though Celebrex is slightly outselling Vioxx, both drugs are
expected to generate nearly $2 billion in sales in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The two drugmakers have been battling it out for the lucrative
pain drug market through heavy consumer advertising and sales calls
on doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, all the studies released on the two drugs involved
tests against placebo or older anti-inflammatory medicines.
Drugmakers rarely conduct head-to-head studies comparing their drug
to rivals because of the risk of a bad outcome.
</P>
<P>
   It unclear if the latest studies will have much of an impact on
doctor's prescribing habits, said pharmaceutical analyst Hemant
Shah of HKS &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   He said the two companies may actually be hurting themselves by
doing studies revealing faults with each other's drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Shah said the companies need to focus on showing how the drugs
are substantially better than ibuprofen and other older drugs,
which cost considerably less than the $2.42 for the daily dosage of
Celebrex and Vioxx.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ted Fields, a rheumatologist at the Hospital for Special
Surgery in New York, said earlier studies show Vioxx and Celebrex
are better than older medicines, but there's no major difference
between the two new brands. Doctors will pay close attention to
these new studies, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The studies conducted by Merck and Pharmacia each asked test
subjects to rate how well they felt after taking Celebrex or Vioxx.
</P>
<P>
   The Pharmacia study of 800 patients with osteoarthritis and high
blood pressure found that 12 percent of Vioxx patients and 6
percent of Celebrex patients developed higher blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The six-week study also found 10 percent of patients taking
Vioxx experienced edema, swelling in the legs, compared to 5
percent taking Celebrex.
</P>
<P>
   In a second Pharmacia study of 182 patients taking Celebrex and
Vioxx, investigators found no difference in how the two brand drugs
relieve pain.
</P>
<P>
   Merck's six-week study of 382 arthritis patients also found in
most measurements the drugs worked equally as well at relieving
pain. But Merck said its study found more subjects rated Vioxx
better at relieving pain during the night and during rest.
</P>
<P>
   The Merck study also found no difference between the drugs in
relieving morning stiffness or pain walking on a flat surface.
</P>
<P>
   In trading Thursday, shares of Merck fell 93.75 cents to $71.50,
and Pharmacia slipped $3.25 to $52.125, both on the New York Stock
Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Bills increasing legal age to buy handguns advance  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Lawmakers moved closer Thursday to pushing
the legal age to buy handguns in New Jersey to 21.
</P>
<P>
   The bill to do that cleared the Law and Public Safety Committee
and now moves to the full Assembly for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   The state Senate voted May 18 to approve the age increase in a
package of bills sponsors said would increase gun safety. Other
measures approved by the Senate would mandate handguns to have
features that allow only a gun's owner to fire the weapon; require
all new guns to undergo ballistics tests and spend $5 million to
supplement enforcement efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the bill passed by the Assembly committee are
criminal penalties for violating the age limit. The current legal
age is 18.
</P>
<P>
   People who knowingly sell a gun to a person under 21 could be
sentenced to up to five years in prison and face $15,000 in fines.
If someone under 21 buys a gun, the penalty would be up to 18
months and a fine of $10,000.

<HEADLINE> Texas Execution Delayed  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL GRACZYK
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- The Texas parole board refused to block
the execution Thursday of Gary Graham in the most contentious death
penalty case to confront Gov. George W. Bush since he announced his
run for the White House. But several last-minute court appeals
delayed the execution.
</P>
<P>
   Late appeals failed in the Supreme Court on a 5-4 vote and in
the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. Graham's attorneys then tried
to win a civil action challenging the constitutionality of the
Texas clemency process; a federal judge ruled he did not have
jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Appeals courts had already rejected Graham's arguments that he
was convicted on shaky evidence from a single eyewitness and that
his trial lawyer did a poor job.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he supported the parole board's decision and pointed
out that Graham's case had been reviewed more than 20 times by
state and federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   ''After considering all of the facts I am convinced justice is
being done,'' Bush said after the appeals were denied. ''May God
bless the victim, the family of the victim, and may God bless Mr.
Graham.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham, 36, was convicted of killing a man in a holdup outside a
Houston supermarket one night in 1981. He pleaded guilty to 10
robberies around the same time but said he was innocent of the
murder.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because of human error and human frailty, we are about to put
to death a man who is innocent,'' said Richard Burr, another of
Graham's attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush-appointed parole board, which has spared a prisoner
only once during the Republican's tenure, could have granted a
120-day reprieve, a commutation to a lesser sentence, or a
conditional pardon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can say, unequivocally, that the board's decision not to
recommend clemency was reached after a complete and unbiased review
of the petition and evidence submitted,'' board chairman Gerald
Garrett said, hours before the execution was to take place.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the vote was announced, protesters outside the
prison in Huntsville began chanting: ''Murderers, murderers.'' A
woman who claimed to be Graham's daughter sobbed in the arms of a
friend.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of officers outnumbered protesters -- most of them
supporters of Graham -- who gathered in stifling heat and humidity
near the brick prison where 221 executions have been carried out
since capital punishment resumed in Texas in 1982. The total is by
far the highest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Graham had vowed to ''fight like hell'' on the trip to the death
chamber.
</P>
<P>
   In the hours leading up to the execution, he refused meals but
met for about an hour with the Rev. Jesse Jackson, whom he
designated his spiritual adviser, his stepmother and Bianca Jagger
of Amnesty International. Jackson said he and Graham talked and
prayed.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was amazingly upbeat,'' Jackson said. ''There were no tears
shed. He had a sense of inner peace. He feels he was being used as
a kind of change agent to expose the system. With every passing
hour ... there is mass education around the world about what is
happening in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham resisted when he was moved late Wednesday from death row
to the death house in downtown Huntsville. Several officers had to
hold Graham down to apply the restraints, said Larry Fitzgerald,
Department of Criminal Justice spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had no authority to halt the execution without a majority
vote from the 18-member parole board. The governor does have the
power to grant a one-time 30-day reprieve in death penalty cases,
but Graham had already received one in 1993 from Bush's
predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had said he would treat the case no differently than any
other he has considered. During the governor's 5&AMP;frac12; years in office,
132 men and two women were executed before Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Bush told the parole board to review the case of
serial killer Henry Lee Lucas because of questions about Lucas's
conviction. His death sentence eventually was commuted to life.
This month, Bush granted a condemned man a 30-day reprieve so that
he could pursue DNA tests. The governor sent no similar messages
about Graham's case.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over Graham's case came amid growing questions about
the death penalty. Illinois Gov. George Ryan has placed a
moratorium on executions, and Bush and Vice President Al Gore have
been forced to address the issue as they campaign for president.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's case brought the loudest protests since pickax killer
Karla Faye Tucker was executed in 1998, the first woman put to
death in Texas since the Civil War era.
</P>
<P>
   Six people were arrested outside the prison Thursday for
breaking through police lines; other activists burned American
flags. Another 150 people protested outside the governor's mansion
in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   No physical evidence tied Graham to the killing of 53-year-old
Bobby Lambert, and ballistics tests showed that the gun he had when
he was arrested was not the murder weapon. But the witness who
identified him, Bernadine Skillern, has never wavered.
</P>
<P>
   Skillern, who was waiting in her car outside the supermarket
while her daughter ran inside, saw the holdup from about 30 feet
away. She identified Graham as the shooter and said the lighting in
the parking lot was adequate.
</P>
<P>
   Graham also argued that his lawyer during the trial, Ron Mock,
should have introduced other witnesses who would say he was not the
killer. But those witnesses initially told police they couldn't
identify the killer, and prosecutors said they were not actual
eyewitnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Bush acknowledged the protests but said he had to uphold the
laws of Texas. ''I recognize there are good people who oppose the
death penalty,'' he said. ''I've heard their message and I respect
their heartfelt point of view.''

<HEADLINE> Expos Release Veteran Catcher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Catcher Charlie O'Brien was released Thursday by
the Montreal Expos, who activated Lenny Webster from the 15-day
disabled list,
</P>
<P>
   In another move, Montreal optioned rookie Brian Schneider to
Triple-A Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a lot of conversations about the whole thing,'' Expos
general manager Jim Beattie said. ''It was not necessarily a slam
dunk because Charlie's been a good addition to us since spring
training. It was difficult but I felt like this would be the best
combination for us.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien, a spring training invitee who was with Anaheim last
year but missed most of the season due to a foot injury, re-injured
his right arch while running out a homer during spring training and
missed the beginning of this season.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien, 39, went 1-for-3 Wednesday night in his first start for
Montreal since June 7. He hit .211 in nine games for the Expos
after his contract was purchased from Double-A Harrisburg on May
25.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't been playing in the last couple of weeks,'' O'Brien
said. ''It's one of those things where you deal with it, and go on.
I'm not going to play just to play anymore. If I can go help a team
that might have a chance to win, then yeah, I would. But otherwise,
it's time to go home and be a dad.''
</P>
<P>
   The left-handed-hitting Schneider, 23, batted .273 in 17 games
for Montreal, including eight starts. He made his major league
debut for the Expos on May 26 in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Widger, the Expos' starting catcher, is hitting .237 with
eight homers and 19 RBIs in 50 games.
</P>
<P>
   Webster, placed on the 15-day DL on June 7 due to tendinitis in
his right shoulder, is hitting .216 in 16 games, including nine
starts.
</P>
<P>
   ''We decided that we wanted to go with two catchers and felt
like this would be the better combination for us right now,''
Beattie said. ''It allows us some flexibility, with Brian catching
in Triple-A, if Widger were to get hurt, or Lenny were to get hurt.
It allowed us to get a bat on the bench that we think we've been
missing.

<HEADLINE> Experts: Sports Violence Continues  </HEADLINE>
By CADONNA M. PEYTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- It's happened for decades -- sports fans
turning the celebration of a big win or a hometown championship
into a violent free-for-all.
</P>
<P>
   It happened in Detroit in 1968, 1984 and 1990. It happened in
Pittsburgh in 1971, Montreal in 1986 and repeatedly last decade in
Chicago and Denver. It happened again Monday night in Los Angeles
when fans celebrating the Lakers' NBA championship burned police
cars, thrashed television news vans, set bonfires and caused
extensive damage to downtown businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say such outbursts can be expected for decades to come.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're always going to have some of these breakdowns,'' said
Demetrius Piarson, professor in the Department of Health and Human
Performance at the University of Houston. ''Some of these
individuals have much at stake. They identify with these teams.
They've grown up with these teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Fan analysts and sports psychologists call them the
''overidentified fans,'' people who feel so strongly about a team
that they consider themselves a part of it.
</P>
<P>
   When hundreds of such fanatics get together, celebrations can
get out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are more prone to do deviant acts when they are in a
group,'' Piarson said.
</P>
<P>
   Violent behavior following a big game is a well-worn phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, police arrested 200 people after the Detroit Tigers won
the World Series. Fans smashed store windows and set fires. One
woman was raped.
</P>
<P>
   It only got worse in the Motor City in 1984 when 100,000 fans
poured into the streets after the Tigers won the World Series,
destroying police cars and taxi cabs, setting some on fire. Dozens
were arrested, many were injured and one person was killed. Six
years later, after the Pistons won their second straight NBA
championship, seven people were killed, six of them hit by cars,
and hundreds were hurt by gunfire, stabbings and fighting as
widespread looting broke out.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of hockey fans took over the streets of Montreal after
the Canadiens won their 23rd Stanley Cup in 1986. Police finally
gained control after an estimated $2 million in damage.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, one man was killed and a child blinded during the
violence that followed the Chicago Bulls' fifth NBA championship.
</P>
<P>
   Fans in Denver rioted following the Broncos' Super Bowl
victories in 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1998 melee, Denver officials prepared for the
following year's Super Bowl by increasing the downtown police
presence. They also restricted parking and blocked major roads to
discourage crowds.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help. Fans set fires, broke windows and threw bottles
at police, causing an estimated $160,000 in damage after the team's
championship repeat.
</P>
<P>
   The aftermath was like ''following the path of a hurricane,''
said Andrew Hudson, spokesman for Denver Mayor Wellington Webb.
</P>
<P>
   ''Psychologists define it as the excitement of winning a major
championship, coupled with testosterone and booze. I wish it was
that simple,'' he said. ''Folks who wouldn't think they would
normally get caught up in this are out there throwing rocks at
police officers. It's a totally bizarre thing.''
</P>
<P>
   All the more puzzling is why some cities suffer such outbursts
while others celebrate peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' win Monday is the nation's third major professional
sports championship this year, but the only one to turn violent.
</P>
<P>
   After the New Jersey Devils won the Stanley Cup this month, the
most serious incident was fans booing Gov. Christie Whitman when
she appeared days later at the victory celebration.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis fans were raucous but peaceful during the Rams' march
to a Super Bowl victory in January.
</P>
<P>
   After the team's win in the conference championship, fans danced
and sang in the streets, high-fiving with motorcycle police. That
picture stands in stark contrast to the images that dominated
television footage in the hours after the Lakers' win, when young
rioters jumped on empty patrol cars, kicked in their windows and
set them ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   Those who study societal trends, however, say post-game violence
can happen anywhere and is sure to happen again.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have created a culture of violence in which it seems
acceptable for emotions to be expressed in a violent manner,'' said
the Rev. C. Welton Gaddy, executive director of The Interfaith
Alliance, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that represents
various religious faiths.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, people conditioned by that culture are apt to
express their joy through destructive behavior...''
</P>
<P>
   Gaddy said politicians, sports players and others who are role
models need to help ''build a societal intolerance to incivility.''

<HEADLINE> Notes on Thursday's Baseball Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
Tigers-Blue Jays:
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT: Juan Gonzalez, the subject of trade rumors, was the DH
against Toronto. ... The Tigers scored 18 runs Tuesday night, but
were shut out Wednesday. Detroit is 1-7 in games following
double-digit runs.
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: RHP Roy Halladay, demoted to the minors on May 16, will
be recalled Saturday and pitch against the Red Sox. ... The Blue
Jays activated C Todd Greene from the 15-day disabled list. To make
room, they demoted C Josh Phelps to Double A Tennessee. ... Carlos
Delgado extended his hitting streak to 16 games.
Yankees-Red Sox:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Jake Westbrook didn't last much longer in his second
major league start than he did in his first. He was charged with
four runs on six hits and two walks in 2 2-3 innings. On Saturday,
he gave up six runs in 1 2-3 innings against the Chicago White Sox.
... Bernie Williams has homered in three consecutive games. ... 2B
Chuck Knoblauch made another throwing error -- his fifth in eight
games, throwing wide of first base in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: Nomar Garciaparra had a pair of doubles in the first
three innings to raise his batting average above .400. He has hit
in 12 consecutive games. ... The Red Sox recalled RHP John Wasdin
from Triple-A Pawtucket to pitch Friday night against Toronto in
place of Jeff Fassero, who went on the disabled list. ... Jeff Frye
has hit in 27 of 29 games.
Indians-White Sox:
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: General manager John Hart said OF Manny Ramirez could
be out another three weeks after reinjuring his left hamstring
during a rehab assignment last weekend with Double-A Akron. Manager
Charlie Manuel said Ramirez worked out in Cleveland on Thursday and
was told he was doing better. ... RHP Charles Nagy, who underwent
right elbow surgery on May 19, is scheduled to make his second
rehab start Monday. If everything goes well, he could rejoin the
team next week, Manuel said. ... Before hitting a triple, double
and single against the White Sox on Wednesday night, Kenny Lofton
and teammate Russell Branyan tussled over a clubhouse card game and
had to be separated.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: CF Chris Singleton was rested and out of the starting
lineup Thursday night, despite an eight-game hitting streak. Jeff
Abbott got the start. ... First base coach Bryan Little presented
the starting lineups at home plate, exchanging them with his
brother Grady, the Indians' bench coach. ... For a fourth straight
game, the crowd greeted the White Sox with a standing ovation as
they took the field. ... RHP Jon Garland, regarded as the White
Sox's top minor league pitching prospect, was chosen to play in the
Triple-A All-Star game. Garland, who has eight wins, was acquired
from the Cubs two years ago for reliever Matt Karchner. The
6-foot-6 Garland was the 10th overall pick in the 1997 draft.
Twins-Rangers:
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: Twins 3B Ron Coomer made his first start Thursday
since corrective surgery on his right foot. Coomer had two tendons
cut in his foot during a surgical procedure after Sunday's game. He
missed two starts but came on as a pinch-hitter in the eighth
inning of Wednesday's 7-5 loss to the Rangers. Coomer flew out for
the third out with two runners on base. ... Twins CEO Chris Clouser
was in Arlington, Texas, and attended the game. ... SS Cristian
Guzman hit his major league-leading 12th triple Wednesday. He is on
pace for 27 triples this year. Rod Carew holds the Twins' record
for triples in a season with 16.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: Rangers RHP John Wetteland was not injured Wednesday
night when hit on the ankle by a ball hit by Twins OF Matt Lawton
in the ninth inning. ''He's OK,'' manager Johnny Oates said. ''He
said he's ready to pitch.'' ... Former Rangers OF Ruben Sierra will
play in the Triple-A All-Star Game on July 12 in Rochester, N.Y.,
and is hitting .332 with seven homers and 35 RBIs for the Oklahoma
RedHawks. He played in three major league All-Star Games (1989,
'91, '92) for the Rangers.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Pirates-Expos:
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: Both teams had to skip batting practice as a
violent, late afternoon thunderstorm knocked out power in the area
surrounding Olympic Stadium. The stadium's lights were restored one
hour and 20 minutes prior to game time. ... OF John Vander Wal's
second grand slam of the season in Wednesday's 8-3 win made him the
first Pirate with more than one grand slam in the same season since
Jeff King hit three in 1996. ... Pittsburgh starters have allowed
just four earned runs in 24 1-3 innings of their last four starts
for a 1.48 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: With C Lenny Webster activated from the 15-day
disabled list Thursday, the Expos elected to go with just two
catchers, releasing veteran Charlie O'Brien and optioning
left-handed hitting rookie Brian Schneider to Triple-A Ottawa.
1B-OF Fernando Seguignol was recalled from the Lynx, giving
Montreal a switch-hitter with power off the bench. ... Injured
closer Ugueth Urbina threw off the mound for five minutes and will
continue to throw in preparation for a rehab assignment with
Ottawa, beginning July 3. RHP Mike Thurman, currently on the 15-day
disabled list for the second time this season with right elbow
tendinitis, also threw off the mound Thursday and will throw again
Sunday, before joining Ottawa on July 4 for his rehab assignment.
... LF Rondell White rejoined the lineup after missing the first
three games of the series with a sore left knee.
Cubs-Braves:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: The Cubs had won six of their previous eight games at
Turner Field. ... Sammy Sosa collected his 1500th career hit in the
fifth inning. ... Glenallen Hill is batting .478 off Terry
Mulholland after going 2-for-4. ... Eric Young was charged with his
eighth error, fourth-most among NL second basemen.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: Chipper Jones' hitting streak ended at 19 games. He was
robbed of a potential three-run homer in the fourth inning when
Damon Buford made an above-the-fence catch in center. ... Terry
Mulholland won for the fourth time in six starts.
Brewers-Marlins:
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: The Brewers three home runs' Wednesday hit by Marquis
Grissom, Jeromy Burnitz and Tyler Houston tied a season-high for
most homers in a game this season, accomplished for the fifth time.
... Brewers RHP Jason Bere will make his first appearance against
Atlanta on Friday. He's 2-3 with a 5.28 ERA in five starts against
NL East teams this season.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: Marlins manager John Boles gave three of his starters
the night off, barring late-game substitutions. David Berg started
in place of Luis Castillo at second; Mark Smith played left instead
of Cliff Floyd, and Andy Fox was at shortstop in place of Alex
Gonzalez. ... The Marlins have allowed three runs or less in seven
of nine games. ... Marlins RHP Ryan Dempster has a 2.06 ERA at
home, fifth in the majors behind Randy Johnson, Kevin Brown, Shawn
Estes and Pedro Martinez.
Rockies-Reds:
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: After concluding their series with the Reds on
Thursday, the Rockies head for Arizona and a weekend series that
will decide first place in the NL West. ... Starter Kevin Jarvis, a
1991 Reds draft pick, made his first career appearance against
Cincinnati on Thursday. It was his 50th career start. ... In his
first five games against the Reds this season, Larry Walker went
10-for-20.
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: The Reds moved OF Deion Sanders from the disabled
list to a restricted list, maintaining their rights to him. Sanders
ended his baseball career again to play football for the Washington
Redskins. ... LHP Ron Villone, scratched from Thursday's game
because of a cut on his left index finger, said he hurt himself at
home a few days ago. He can throw without problem, but the cut
bleeds when he throws a fastball. He hopes to make his next start.
Phillies-Mets:
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: Rookie 1B Pat Burrell, the No. 1 pick in the 1998
draft, is beginning to show why he was so heralded as a college
hitter at Miami. Burrell is 8-for-26 in seven games, including his
first multihomer game and first grand slam in Wednesday night's
victory. Since being recalled May 24, he's hitting .221 (21-for-95)
with six homers and 19 RBIs. ''He's only gotten about 90 at-bats or
so, but you've seen glimpses of the type of player he's going to
be,'' Phillies manager Terry Francona said. ''He's still developing
and he wants to get better. It's real easy to be patient with a
player like that.'' ... 1B Rico Brogna, on the DL since May 11 with
a broken left forearm, participated in light outfield drills before
the game -- with the cast on. He said he hopes to return by the
All-Star break. ... A win on Thursday night would give the Phillies
a season-high four-game winning streak, and their first road sweep
of the season. ... RHP Robert Person is skipping his scheduled
start Friday with tightness in his shoulder. RHP Dave Coggin, who
will be recalled from Triple-A Scranton Wilkes-Barre on Friday,
will make his major league debut against Montreal in Person's
place.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: As GM Steve Phillips spoke to the media before the
game, fans chanted ''A-Rod! A-Rod!'' for Alex Rodriguez, the highly
coveted Seattle SS who will be a free agent after this season.
Since the Mets learned SS Rey Ordonez will be out the rest of the
season with a broken arm, Rodriguez has gone to the top of many
fans' wish lists. ''I can understand why the fans get excited about
him,'' Phillips said. ''He's a great player, but from our
standpoint, I can't comment on another player from another team
because that's tampering.'' ... RHP Bobby J. Jones will be recalled
from Triple-A Norfolk on Friday to start against Pittsburgh. Jones
was 1-3 with a 10.91 ERA before being sent down. ... The Mets play
14 of their next 18 games at Shea Stadium. ... The Mets have hit 20
home runs in 11 games.
Dodgers-Astros:
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: Matt Herges is the first Dodgers pitcher to start
5-0 since Antonio Osuna did it in 1998. Herges ranked second among
NL rookies in wins, and is first among rookie relievers with 40
strikeouts. ... C-INF Jim Leyritz was in uniform for the first time
Thursday after being traded from the Yankees for Jose Vizcaino on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: Craig Biggio needs three hits to pass Jose Cruz as the
Astros' career hits leader. Biggio has 1,935 hits. ... Jeff Bagwell
is the only Astros opening day starter who has not missed time due
to either injury or illness this season. Bagwell and Biggio were
the only opening day starters last season not to spend at least
some time on the DL. Biggio hasn't ever been on the DL in his
career, but missed two games early this season with an eye problem.
Giants-Cardinals:
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: OF Ellis Burks sat out with knee soreness.
Manager Dusty Baker said he'd be happy if Burks could play two out
of every three days. ... Baker isn't looking forward to the Giants'
first trip to Enron Field for a three-game series against the
Astros from Friday through Sunday. He didn't think the flag pole in
center field, the weird angles and the concrete curb in the
outfield were cute touches. ''You're going to hurt some high-priced
players,'' Baker said. ''Is it worth the risk? Some of the guys
haven't played there to know the hazards.'' ... After a 90-minute
meeting with struggling RHP Russ Ortiz and pitching coach Dave
Righetti, Baker decided not to demote Ortiz to the bullpen. Ortiz,
an 18-game winner last year, but 3-7 with a 6.89 ERA this year,
will start Sunday at Houston. ''I think it's hard to work it out
when you're out of the rotation,'' Baker said. ''He's where Shawn
Estes was a little while ago, where he's a little confused between
power and finesse, which happens to guys.''
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: Manager Tony La Russa wasn't blaming C Mike Matheny
for trying to bunt for a hit in the seventh inning of Wednesday's
4-1 loss to the Giants. Matheny, the No. 8 hitter, ended up with a
sacrifice, and La Russa allowed pitcher Garrett Stephenson to bat
with two outs and a runner on second. La Russa said Matheny told
him that he noticed the defense was playing well back. ''It's not a
bad play on his part,'' La Russa said. ''He gets the ball past the
pitcher, it's a hit.'' ... 3B Fernando Tatis, on the disabled list
since April 29 with a torn groin, will hit in simulated game action
for the second time Friday with reliever David Wainhouse -- also on
the disabled list -- doing the throwing. On Wednesday, Wainhouse was
wild and Tatis only took a couple of swings, but La Russa said it
still was a good barometer because Tatis was able to sight the ball
and lay off bad pitches. The team remained undecided whether to
activate Tatis whenever he's ready and let him play in the majors,
or send him on a brief rehab assignment. ... Shawon Dunston batted
leadoff for the first time this season Thursday. ''I'm not looking
for a walk,'' the free-swinging Dunston said before the game. ''See
ball, hit ball, have some fun.'' Last year, Dunston walked twice in
106 plate appearances.

<HEADLINE> McGwire Ties Schmidt's Homer Mark  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire tied Mike Schmidt for seventh on
the career home run list, hitting No. 548 in the fourth inning
against the San Francisco Giants on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's first homer in three days was the Cardinals' first hit
off Shawn Estes. It came on a 2-0 pitch, and traveled an estimated
475 feet to straightaway center. McGwire has 101 homers and 214
RBIs in 212 career games at Busch Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   With his 26th homer of the season, McGwire also pulled into a
tie with Barry Bonds of the Giants for the major league lead. He is
on pace to hit 59 homers after hitting 65 last year and a record 70
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who took a called third strike that ended the first,
reached 548 homers in 5,832 at-bats. It took Schmidt 8,352 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this season, McGwire passed Jimmie Foxx (534) and Mickey
Mantle (536). Reggie Jackson is sixth on the career list with 563.

<HEADLINE> Board votes to raise rental units  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - The city's Rent Guidelines Board voted Thursday
to let landlords increase rent on one-and two-year leases,
affecting 1 million rent-stabilized apartments.
</P>
<P>
   The board approved a 4 percent increase for one-year leases and
6 percent for two-year leases, the largest increase in four years.
</P>
<P>
   Neither tenant groups nor landlord advocates have been happy
with the board's proposals in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Some tenants - carrying signs and chanting ''shame, shame,'' -
stormed the stage Thursday and briefly interrupted the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   A police spokesman did not immediately know whether any arrests
were made.
</P>
<P>
   Landlord advocates had wanted rent hikes of 9 percent on
one-year leases and 15 percent on two-year leases. They've said the
hikes were needed to offset rising operating costs, particularly
fuel oil, and to recoup from the recession.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani called the board's decision
''unfortunate'' but pointed out that the panel is independent of
his administration. He had urged the board to approve increases of
3 percent for one-year leases and 5 percent for two-year leases.
</P>
<P>
   He also blamed President Clinton for allowing heating oil prices
to soar.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly, some of the pressure exerted on the board was due to
the fact that there appears to be no relief in sight from the
ever-increasing price of home heating oil resulting from OPEC's
price gouging,'' Giuliani said in a press release. ''This has been
going on for over a year without any adequate response from the
Clinton administration.''

<HEADLINE> Congress Leaders OK Spending Pact  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House and Senate leaders broke a spending
impasse on Thursday, agreeing to free $12 billion in long-delayed
funds to help Colombia's war on drugs, pay for U.S. troops in
Kosovo and provide natural disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement came as the Senate voted 95-4 to endorse a $13.4
billion foreign aid bill.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation contained just under $1 billion in
anti-narcotics assistance to Colombia. However, under the new
agreement that amount will now be increased to $1.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That would bring it closer to a $1.7 billion Colombia package
approved by the House in March.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., a prime sponsor of the Colombia
proposal, called the final vote ''a major victory toward stopping
the spread of illegal narcotics into the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was rising pressure from the Pentagon, as much as
anything, that appears to have contributed to the breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon, which has been drawing down other accounts to pay
for keeping its troops in Kosovo, has said it will have to start
curtailing activities early next month unless it receives $1.5
billion the bill contains for Kosovo. Republicans do not want such
cutbacks blamed on them, particularly in an election year.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate leaders planned to take the entire $12 billion
spending package -- some of it to reimburse victims of last
September's Hurricane Floyd -- and attach it to a popular military
construction spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert hopes the spending package can be
approved in the House next week, said Hastert spokesman John
Feehery.
</P>
<P>
   John Czwartacki, a spokesman for Lott, said a Senate final vote
was also possible next week.
</P>
<P>
   The catchall spending bill would also provide money to help to
rebuild fire-ravaged Los Alamos, N.M., including parts of the
national nuclear laboratory there.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional sources, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
said the Los Alamos money would be about $500 million -- but could
go higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's endorsement of President Clinton's Colombia package
proved the catalyst that helped speed an overall agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has been pressing Congress to finish work on
the Colombian aid package for months.
</P>
<P>
   It was originally part of $5.2 billion that Clinton requested in
January that also included money for U.S. troops in Kosovo and for
victims of Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved a $13 billion version on March 30, adding
even more money for the Pentagon and domestic natural disasters and
other projects.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Senate, the bill was split into three pieces attached
to other spending bills, with the Colombia money going onto the
foreign aid one.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's $12 billion agreement puts the pieces back together
again, with a slightly lower price tag.
</P>
<P>
   While on a fund-raising trip in the West, Clinton spoke by
telephone from Air Force One to Colombian President Andres
Pastrana, who wanted to thank Clinton for his help in securing the
aid package.
</P>
<P>
   Before departing, he praised the Senate and urged quick passage
of the plan, saying it is needed to help Colombia's government
maintain social order.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're in the fight of their lives for their very way of
life, with the combined pressure of a guerrilla war that's been
going on for decades and the rise of the narco-traffickers,''
Clinton said. ''The quicker we can reach agreement and show that
the United States is committed to a democracy and to fighting the
drug wars in Colombia ... the better off we're going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   In Colombia, Pastrana said the vote was a recognition of the
countries' ''shared responsibility'' in battling narcotics. He also
played down concerns that Washington is getting involved in
Colombia's civil conflict. The money, he said, is ''not military
aid, but anti-narcotics aid.''
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the Colombia money would go toward training special
counternarcotics battalions in the Colombian military and for
dozens of American-made helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia is by far the world's largest exporter of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   The overall foreign aid measure is $1.7 billion less than
Clinton had requested, drawing strong complaints -- but no veto
threats -- from the administration. The Senate cut Clinton's request
for $262 million for the world's poorest countries to just $75
million.
</P>
<P>
   Other key components of the foreign aid bill:
</P>
<P>
   --Israel, at $2.8 billion, remains the largest single recipient
of U.S. aid. The Senate did not attach conditions, despite
complaints about Israel's proposed sale of a $250 million spy plane
to China. Egypt is second with $2.0 billion.
</P>
<P>
   --Aid to Russia would be conditioned on Moscow's cooperation with
international efforts to provide humanitarian assistance in
Chechnya and to investigate human rights abuses there.
</P>
<P>
   Among those criticizing the Colombia money were Democrats who
said they would rather it be spent domestically to prevent drug use
and Republicans reluctant to get involved in a South American civil
war.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's not get into another new armed conflict,'' said Sen.
Slade Gorton, R-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   His amendment to slash all but $200 million of the funds was
rejected 79-19. By a similar margin, the Senate also rejected an
attempt by Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., to divert $225 million to
home-based drug abuse programs.
</P>
<P>
   On the final vote, the four voting ''no'' were Sens. Russ
Feingold, D-Wis.; Bob Smith, R-N.H.; Craig Thomas, R-Wyo.; and
Wellstone. Not voting was Sen. Tim Johnson, D-S.D.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The foreign aid bill is S. 2522.

<HEADLINE> Senate Delays Workplace Rules  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican-controlled Senate voted
Thursday night to block proposed Clinton administration rules
giving workers new protections against repetitive motion injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The 57-41 vote, on an amendment sponsored by GOP Sen. Mike Enzi
of Wyoming, was mostly along party lines and came several days
after the House adopted a similar ban. Democrats immediately said
President Clinton would veto the overall bill, which provides
annual spending for the departments of Labor, Education, Health and
Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   Delaying the rules was ''one of many objectionable items'' in
the bill, White House spokesman Joel Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the regulations developed by the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration could help for an estimated 1.8
million workers who suffer from ergonomic injuries each year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Republican position is turn a deaf ear to these workers,
ignoring the fact that they are facing debilitating injuries,''
said Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans insisted that the new rules would cost businesses
too much. ''There are going to be workers who lose their job
because of this rule if it's imposed,'' said Sen. Tim Hutchinson,
R-Ark. ''There are small businesses that are going to go bankrupt
because of this rule if it's not stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rules, made public in November after a decade of
study and delay, would require employers to minimize the everyday
physical stresses of a broad range of jobs. Final standards are now
scheduled to be released by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Because the vote came on a one-year spending bill, the ban
technically would expire at the end of the next fiscal year, in
October 2001.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA estimates the rules would cost businesses $4.7 billion to
implement, but predicts net savings of $9 billion in medical costs
and increased productivity. Republicans say that figure is wrong,
pointing to Small Business Administration estimates of $60 billion
a year or more.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the largest, most onerous and expensive rule in the
history of this agency,'' Enzi said. ''This rule has serious,
substantial flaws.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also argued that the rules are not based on sound
science, that they could usurp state worker compensation laws and
that they could jeopardize the quality of health care provided for
Medicare and Medicaid recipients.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want a regulation going into effect in December
without us having additional time to consider it,'' said Sen. Don
Nickles, R-Okla.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats disagreed. ''The science is clear,'' said Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass. ''The question is whether we have the will and the
determination to protect American workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Three Democrats broke ranks on the bill: Sens. Ernest Hollings
of South Carolina, John Breaux of Louisiana and Blanche Lincoln of
Arkansas. One Republican voted against the amendment, Sen. Arlen
Specter of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Two senators missed the vote: Democrats Daniel Inouye of Hawaii
and Barbara Boxer of California.

By The Associated PressMichel Droit
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Michel Droit, a prize-winning French novelist,
journalist and one of 40 members of the prestigious Academie
Francaise, died Thursday. No cause of death was given. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   A novelist, essayist and editorialist for two decades with the
conservative daily Le Figaro, Droit gained wide acclaim for his
interviews with Gen. Charles de Gaulle.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, he was elected to the Academie Francaise -- one of only
40 ''immortals'' as the institution's members are known.
</P>
<P>
   He worked in radio and television, and was the only journalist
in France to interview de Gaulle on television -- in December 1965,
June 1968 and April 1969, a year before the general's death in
1970.
</P>
<P>
   Droit's professional career was intricately linked to de
Gaulle's. In 1972, Droit won the Edmond-Michelet prize for ''A Free
Frenchman,'' a documentary about de Gaulle, France's most
influential postwar leader.
</P>
<P>
   His five-volume ''Man of Destiny'' is widely regarded as one of
the most thorough examinations of de Gaulle's life and work.
</P>
<P>
   Editor in chief at France's state-run television in the early
1960s, Droit launched several successful programs, including ''A
Propos,'' which ran for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Droit worked at Le Figaro's literary supplement from 1961-71,
and went on to write columns for the weekly Figaro Magazine. In
1984, he published four volumes of his private diary, and later,
two volumes of memoirs.
Jim Hensley
</P>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Jim Hensley, father of Sen. John McCain's wife
and the founder of the nation's second-largest Anheuser-Busch
distributorship, died Wednesday after a lengthy illness. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   Hensley, a World War II veteran, was the founder, owner and
chairman of the board of Hensley &AMP; Co., which accounted for much of
the family's wealth.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter, Cindy Hensley McCain, was married in 1980 to
McCain, Arizona's senior senator who pushed presumptive GOP
presidential nominee George W. Bush in this year's presidential
primaries before bowing out.
Wallace Savage
</P>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Former Dallas Mayor Wallace Savage, who is
credited with preserving one of the city's best-known historic
areas and bringing racial equality to some of the city's services,
died Monday after a stroke and battle with pneumonia. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Savage served as mayor from 1949 to 1951. He and his wife worked
to save homes from being razed and replaced with apartments.
Community leaders in Dallas credited the couple with starting a
movement that led to city preservation ordinances.
</P>
<P>
   Savage, who was elected mayor when segregation was the norm,
crusaded against violence against blacks, eliminated the city's
segregated ambulance service and made city parks accessible to
blacks. He also refused to bow to pressure from white leaders who
wanted to deny police protection to blacks.

<HEADLINE> Senate GOP Rejects Drug Plan  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans rejected a Democratic bid
to create a Medicare prescription drug benefit Thursday night as
political maneuvering intensified on an election-year issue
affecting 39 million senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 53-44, largely along party lines, and came at the
end of a daylong Democratic offensive on Medicare, an issue that
has long bedeviled the GOP at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans accused Democrats of being more interested in
scoring political points than in passing legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I say that this matter is too important, too important, too
important to our senior citizens to rush it through as a political
issue instead of working together,'' said Sen. William V. Roth,
R-Del. Roth, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said members
of the panel have been meeting for weeks in hopes of finding a
bipartisan compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Championing the Democratic proposal, which would mandate a
uniform government-defined prescription drug benefit be offered
under Medicare, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said: ''It is
comprehensive. It is all inclusive. It is affordable and it will
meet the needs of our senior citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats pressed for the vote one day after House
Republicans had muscled their own, different plan through the House
Ways and Means Committee and prepared for a floor vote as early as
next week.
</P>
<P>
   That proposal calls for private insurance companies, backed by
hefty federal subsidies, to offer prescription drug coverage to
Medicare recipients nationwide. The bill includes subsidies for
low-income senior citizens, as well as those experiencing extremely
high costs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our plan will offer the best prices on the drugs (senior
citizens) need, not some government bureaucracy plan that may not
offer the drug the doctor prescribed,'' said Rep. Phil English of
Pennsylvania, one of several Republicans who touted the GOP
handiwork during the day.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, 42 Democrats and two Republicans, Peter
Fitzgerald of Illinois and Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, voted in
favor of the proposal. There were 52 Republicans and Democrat John
Breaux of Louisiana -- a longtime advocate of bipartisan changes in
Medicare -- opposed. Not voting were Democrats Barbara Boxer of
California and Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, as well as Republican Ben
Campbell of Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The White House claimed encouragement in defeat. ''We view it as
an encouraging first step toward a bipartisan majority for a real
drug benefit under Medicare,'' said White House official Joel
Johnson. ''We look forward to working with the Congress to achieve
the handful of votes necessary for passage.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton struck a far different note earlier in the
day, accusing House Repuplicans of making a ''false promise'' with
their plan, and spearheading a furious Democratic response.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a benefit for the companies who make the drugs, not the
seniors who need them most,'' Clinton said of the GOP proposal, his
sharply partisan rhetoric underscoring the potency of the issue in
the run-up to the fall elections.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton criticized the Republicans in remarks to reporters at
the White House. Donna Shalala, secretary of Health and Human
Services, traveled to Congress to join House Democratic leader Dick
Gephardt in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Senate Democrats used a parliamentary maneuver to bring
their bill to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I honestly don't believe that their proposal is a bona fide
proposal so far as Medicare is concerned,'' said Senate Democratic
leader Tom Daschle.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic alternative envisions a uniform
government-defined prescription drug benefit to be offered to all
Medicare recipients. its principal advocates include Sen. Bob
Graham of Florida, whose state is home to millions of retirees, and
Sen. Charles Robb of Virginia, who faces a strong re-election
challenge this fall.
</P>
<P>
   They estimated the premium under their plan at about $35 a
month, with a deductible of $250 a year. After that, the government
and the individual would evenly split the cost of the next $3,500
in drug expenses. The government's share would rise to 75 percent
for annual expenses between $3,500 and $4,000, and the federal
treasury would pick up the entire cost above that amount.
</P>
<P>
   Their bill also provides subsidies for low-income senior
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Graham estimated the cost at roughly $50 billion a year and $240
billion over 10 years, and stressed that once the deductible was
paid, there was no gap in coverage.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the House GOP bill costs an estimated $40 billion
over five years.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also said their bill included provisions designed to
foster competition among providers, and said they hoped it would
help bring Republican support.

<HEADLINE> Expos 6, Pirates 5  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Jose Vidro homered and had three RBIs as the
Montreal Expos held on Thursday night for a 6-5 win over the
Pittsburgh Pirates and a four-game split.
</P>
<P>
   Vidro, who went 3-for-4 to raise his average to .368, hit an RBI
single in the first off Todd Ritchie (4-4), a tiebreaking, two-run
homer in the second and a leadoff single in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Dustin Hermanson (6-4) recovered from a three-run, first-inning,
retiring 14 of 15 batters after Bruce Aven's two-out, RBI double
gave the Pirates a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Morris doubled off Hermanson to begin the game, took
third on Jason Kendall's single and scored on John Vander Wal's
sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Giles doubled home Kendall and scored on Bruce Aven's
double.
</P>
<P>
   Hermanson allowed three runs and eight hits in 6 2-3 innings for
his first win in four starts since rejoining the starting rotation
on June 5 after filling in for injured closer Ugueth Urbina.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Telford got four outs for his first save of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal closed in the first on Vidro's RBI single and Vladimir
Guerrero's run-scoring grounder

<P>
   In the second, Hermanson's two-out grounder to shortstop Pat
Meares became a three-base error -- Aven, playing left -- threw his
glove at the ball and just missed striking it as it rolled to wall
in left-center.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Bergeron hit a grounder through first baseman Kevin
Young's legs for a two-base error as Hermanson scored to make it
3-3. Vidro followed with a two-run homer.

<P>
   Ritchie allowed five runs -- just two earned -- and five hits in
six innings.

   Fernando Seguignol's RBI single in the seventh put Montreal up
6-3, but the Pirates scored a pair in the eighth on Meares'
run-scoring single and Morris' RBI grounder.

Notes: A woman sitting behind the Expos' dugout was struck in the
face when Brian Giles' bat went sailing into the stands as he swung
and missed a pitch in the sixth. The woman, whose face was
bloodied, was attended to by stadium security personnel and
assisted from her seat. ... White returned to the lineup after
missing the first three games of the series with a sore right knee.

<P>
   FEDERAL WAY, Wash. (AP) -- Troy Dumais, who was second heading
into Thursday's night 3-meter springboard finals at the U.S.
Olympic diving trials, twice visited a hospital earlier in the day
because of kidney stones.
</P>
<P>
   Dumais, 21, arrived at King County Aquatic Center about 1&AMP;frac12; hours
before the competition began and planned to dive, his coach Matt
Scoggin said. He didn't appear to be in visible pain during several
minutes of practice.
</P>
<P>
   Dumais, who passed a kidney stone last July during the World
University Games in Spain, went to St. Francis Hospital with pain
in his left side at 2 a.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He was given an anti-inflammatory medicine that didn't contain
banned steroids rather than a commonly used morphine-based
medication, Scoggin said. Dumais immediately felt better and left
the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   However, the pain returned shortly before 5 p.m. and Dumais
returned to the hospital for another shot of medicine and a liter
of fluid, Scoggin said.
</P>
<P>
   Dumais didn't pass a kidney stone, but Scoggin said there was
significant blood in the diver's urine.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Jay Payton hit a go-ahead, two-run homer in the
sixth inning as the New York Mets avoided a three-game sweep with a
5-4 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Payton's homer off starter Cliff Politte appeared to skim the
top of right fielder Bobby Abreu's glove and go over the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Bell and Melvin Mora also homered, and Glendon Rusch (5-5)
pitched seven strong innings for the Mets. Rusch allowed two runs,
seven hits, struck out five and walked one.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Cook got the last out for his first save this season.
</P>
<P>
   With the score 2-2 in the sixth, Robin Ventura hit a one-out
double down the right-field line off Politte (1-2) and Todd Zeile
hit a comebacker to Politte before Payton drove a 2-0 pitch to
right field.
</P>
<P>
   Abreu went back to the wall, stretched out his glove and the
ball seemed to glide off the glove and over the wall for a 4-2
lead.
</P>
<P>
   New York added a run in the seventh off Steve Schrenk.
Pinch-hitter Lenny Harris hit a one-out double, and moved to third
on Mora's deep flyout to center. Bell, 2-for-3 with two RBIs,
followed with a weak grounder down the third-base line that Scott
Rolen could not make a play on.
</P>
<P>
   Rolen hit a solo homer off Turk Wendell in the eighth to make it
5-3. Wendell walked Mike Lieberthal, who went to second on a passed
ball. Pat Burrell hit a grounder to third, and Ventura overthrew
first baseman Zeile to put runners on second and third. Kevin
Jordan drove in Lieberthal with a long drive that Joe McEwing, who
came in as a defensive replacement in the inning, caught on the
run. Wendell then got the next two outs to get out of the jam.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies got off to a quick start against Rusch on RBI
singles by Abreu and Lieberthal.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets got a run back in the bottom of the first on Bell's
solo homer to left-center .
</P>
<P>
   Mora tied it for the Mets in the fifth with a two-out, solo
homer. his first since April 30.
</P>
<P>
   Politte pitched allowed four runs in six innings and five hits --
all for extra bases.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Mets are 5-1 in Rusch's last six outings. ... Ventura
made two errors, giving him 10 this season. ... Bell's homer was
his first since June 9 against Roger Clemens in the Mets' 12-2
victory over the New York Yankees. ... RHP Bobby J. Jones will be
recalled from Triple-A Norfolk on Friday to start against
Pittsburgh. Jones was 1-3 with a 10.91 ERA before being sent down.
... The Mets play 13 of their next 17 games at Shea Stadium ...
Mets C Mike Piazza was given the night off. ... The Mets have hit
23 home runs in their last 12 games. Abreu started in right field
after not starting in two straight games as punishment for showing
up late Tuesday. He entered Wednesday night's game in the ninth as
a defensive replacement. ... Phillies RHP Robert Person will miss
his scheduled start on Friday night with tightness in his shoulder.
RHP Dave Coggin, who will be recalled from Triple-A Scranton
Wilkes-Barre on Friday, will make his major league debut in
Person's place.

<HEADLINE> Olympics Organizer Usher Dies  </HEADLINE>
By ERICA WERNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Harry Usher, Peter Ueberroth's right-hand man
in organizing the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, died Thursday of an
apparent heart attack. He was 61.
</P>
<P>
   Usher was found dead at 7:25 a.m. in a workout room in a
Secaucus, N.J., hotel. The Los Angeles resident had been commuting
to New Jersey, where he ran an Internet sports company.
</P>
<P>
   Usher was an attorney whose career ranged far from the practice
of entertainment law, his specialty. He was the second and last
commissioner of the upstart United States Football League during
its unsuccessful challenge of the National Football League in the
1980s and also served as executive director of the Association of
Volleyball Professionals.
</P>
<P>
   But his most prominent role was as executive vice president and
general manager of the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney's clients included Ueberroth, and the millionaire
entrepreneur and former baseball commissioner tapped him for the
role.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of unprofitable Olympic Games, the two were given
what many said was an impossible task, organizing the first
privately funded Olympics. They not only raised the money needed,
but ended up with a stunning $225 million surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a brilliant man,'' said Anita DeFrantz, president of
the Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles, which is funded by
the surplus. ''His gift to the Olympic movement was his
extraordinary management of the 1984 Olympic Games. And he
certainly will be remembered for his enormous skills as a
manager.''
</P>
<P>
   Usher helped put together an Olympics in a city so
geographically spread out and lacking in public transportation that
many believed freeways would shut down in gridlock when sports
events began taking place at venues as far as 50 miles apart. But
after a massive campaign that publicized event times, parking and
alternative routes, the games took place in a city that residents
would later say seemed less crowded than normal.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 10 years later, Ueberroth came to Usher for help again,
this time making him his second-in-command at Rebuild LA, the
nonprofit group charged with rebuilding the city after the 1992
riots.
</P>
<P>
   Usher's latest venture was the Internet sports company
PROTEAM.com, which DeFrantz said he was in the process of
relocating from the East Coast to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey native is survived by his wife, Jane, and six
children from two marriages.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial service will be held Sunday at the offices of the
Amateur Athletic Foundation in Los Angeles.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- John Snyder pitched two-hit shutout ball over six
innings, and Charlie Hayes hit a two-run homer, leading the
Milwaukee Brewers to a 6-1 victory over the Florida Marlins on
Thursday night and a split of the four-game series.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder (3-2), who has won his last three starts, gave up just
two singles. He struck out four and walked six.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Lopez hit a solo homer in the first and Hayes, who ended an
0-for-20 skid Wednesday, ripped a two-run homer over the left-field
scoreboard in the fourth for a 3-0 lead. Lopez singled and scored
ahead of Hayes' sixth homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Jenkins, a seventh-inning defensive replacement in left
field, hit his 13th homer, a solo shot, leading off the eighth
against reliever Vic Darensbourg. It was the second consecutive
night the Brewers hit three homers.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Blanco's two-run double in the ninth capped the scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Sanchez (4-6), who has five losses and three no-decisions
in his last eight starts, gave up six hits and three runs in 6 1-3
innings, with seven strikeouts and one walk.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder got out of a bases-loaded, one-out jam in the fourth by
striking out Andy Fox and Paul Bako.
</P>
<P>
   Bako hit a one-out single in the seventh off reliever Juan
Acevedo and scored on Mark Kotsay's two-out triple for the Marlins'
lone run.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Brewers RHP Jason Bere will make his first appearance
against Atlanta on Friday. He's 2-3 with a 5.28 ERA in five starts
against NL East teams this season. ... Sanchez gave up two homers,
giving him a team-high 18, tied for fourth-most in the NL. ...
Marlins manager John Boles gave three starters the night off. David
Berg started in place of Luis Castillo at second; Mark Smith played
left instead of Cliff Floyd, and Fox was at shortstop in place of
Alex Gonzalez. Floyd flied out as a pinch-hitter in the seventh ...
The Marlins drew 8,285 fans, their highest attendance figure in the
four-game series.

<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- David Wells became baseball's first 12-game
winner and Tony Batista homered twice as the Toronto Blue Jays beat
the Detroit Tigers 7-4 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Wells (12-2) has won five straight decisions. The 37-year-old
left-hander allowed two runs -- one earned -- on seven hits in seven
innings. He struck out seven and walked two.
</P>
<P>
   Batista, acquired from Arizona last season, has 44 home runs and
133 RBIs in 163 games with the Blue Jays. He hit a solo shot in the
fourth and a two-run homer in the eighth to raise his total to 18
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Stewart also homered for the Blue Jays, who have homered
in a club-record 20 straight games.
</P>
<P>
   Hideo Nomo (2-7) pitched his first complete game since Aug. 26,
1998, when he was with the New York Mets. He went the distance
Thursday despite giving up seven runs on eight hits.
</P>
<P>
   Wells walked Damion Easley to start the game, and put the next
batter aboard with a throwing error. Easley then scored on Bobby
Higginson's double-play ball.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto made it 2-1 in the bottom half of the first on Carlos
Delgado's RBI single, and Brad Fullmer's run-scoring double.
Alberto Castillo's sacrifice fly in the second made it 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Clark homered in the third to bring Detroit within 3-2, but
Batista's first homer of the game and Stewart's solo shot in the
fifth inning made it 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit scored its final two runs on RBI groundouts by Tony
Clark and Deivi Cruz off reliever Billy Koch in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Arizona traded Batista and RHP John Frascatore to Toronto
on June 12, 1999, in exchange for LHP Dan Plesac. ... Wells has won
11 of his last 13 starts. ... Delgado extended his hitting streak
to 16 games. ... RHP Roy Halladay, demoted to the minors on May 16,
will be activated in time to start for the Blue Jays on Saturday.
... Detroit LF Higginson dropped a fly ball for an error in the
sixth inning. ... Clark has eight home runs. ... Juan Gonzalez, the
subject of trade rumors, went 1-for-3.

score of 25-1, the Red Sox won the final two to retake the AL East
lead, a half-game ahead of the Yankees and Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams homered for the third consecutive game for New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez (6-4) rebounded from one of his worst starts of the
season to hold New York to two runs on four hits, striking out a
season-high seven batters.
</P>
<P>
   Jake Westbrook (0-2), making his second major league start, gave
up four runs and six hits in 2 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Lowe pitched a perfect ninth for his 17th save.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, who has hits in 12 consecutive games, gave the
Boston fans a scare when he collided with center fielder Carl
Everett while fielding a popup in the seventh inning. The Red Sox
shortstop threw the ball into the infield sitting on the grass but
then rolled over, clutching his calf.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Jimy Williams and trainer Jim Rowe ran out to tend to
him, but after a few minutes Garciaparra got up and returned to his
position. On his way back to the dugout, Williams stopped at the
mound to replace Martinez with Bryce Florie.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, whose average climbed to .400 after his first two
at-bats, led off the next inning and lined out to left.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez made it past the fifth inning just twice in his
previous six starts, allowing seven runs in three innings Saturday
against Toronto. He retired the first two New York batters before
walking Paul O'Neill and giving up Williams' 16th homer.
</P>
<P>
   Boston tied it in the second when Garciaparra doubled and scored
on Everett's single. Everett took third on Brian Duabach's single
and scored on Jason Varitek's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, Jeff Frye doubled, Trot Nixon walked and
Garciaparra doubled to make it 4-3. Everett was intentionally
walked to load the bases, then Daubach singled; Nixon scored, but
Garciaparra was called out at the plate even though replays
appeared to show that he was never tagged.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Westbrook didn't last much longer in his second
major-league start than he did in his first. On Saturday, he gave
up six runs in 1 2-3 innings against the Chicago White Sox. ...
Chuck Knoblauch made another throwing error -- his fifth in eight
games, throwing wide of first base in the fourth. ... Garciaparra
briefly raised his batting average above .400. ... The Red Sox
recalled John Wasdin from Triple-A Pawtucket on Friday night
against Toronto in place of Jeff Fassero, who is on the disabled
list. ... Frye has hit in 27 of his last 29 games. ... Everett
failed to homer against the Yankees -- the time he has failed to
homer in 11 series at Fenway Park this season. ... Derek Jeter was
held hitless for just the third time in 23 games since coming off
the disabled list May 27.

<HEADLINE> Harry Usher, Los Angeles Olympics organizer, dies at 61  </HEADLINE>
By ERICA WERNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Harry Usher, Peter Ueberroth's right-hand man
in organizing the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, died Thursday of an
apparent heart attack. He was 61.
</P>
<P>
   Usher was found dead at 7:25 a.m. in a workout room in a
Secaucus, N.J., hotel. The Los Angeles resident had been commuting
to New Jersey, where he ran an Internet sports company.
</P>
<P>
   Usher was an attorney whose career ranged far from the practice
of entertainment law, his specialty. He was the second and last
commissioner of the upstart United States Football League during
its unsuccessful challenge of the National Football League in the
1980s and also served as executive director of the Association of
Volleyball Professionals.
</P>
<P>
   But his most prominent role was as executive vice president and
general manager of the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney's clients included Ueberroth, and the millionaire
entrepreneur and former baseball commissioner tapped him for the
role.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of unprofitable Olympic Games, the two were given
what many said was an impossible task, organizing the first
privately funded Olympics. They not only raised the money needed,
but ended up with a stunning $225 million surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a brilliant man,'' said Anita DeFrantz, president of
the Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles, which is funded by
the surplus. ''His gift to the Olympic movement was his
extraordinary management of the 1984 Olympic Games. And he
certainly will be remembered for his enormous skills as a
manager.''
</P>
<P>
   Usher helped put together an Olympics in a city so
geographically spread out and lacking in public transportation that
many believed freeways would shut down in gridlock when sports
events began taking place at venues as far as 50 miles apart. But
after a massive campaign that publicized event times, parking and
alternative routes, the games took place in a city that residents
would later say seemed less crowded than normal.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 10 years later, Ueberroth came to Usher for help again,
this time making him his second-in-command at Rebuild LA, the
nonprofit group charged with rebuilding the city after the 1992
riots.
</P>
<P>
   Usher's latest venture was the Internet sports company
PROTEAM.com, which DeFrantz said he was in the process of
relocating from the East Coast to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey native is survived by his wife, Jane, and six
children from two marriages.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial service will be held Sunday at the offices of the
Amateur Athletic Foundation in Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE> China Tests Artillery Near Taiwan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- China on Friday began live-fire artillery
tests off its southeast coast directly across from Taiwan, Taiwan's
military said.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwanese officials said the exercises were routine and not a
threat to this island.
</P>
<P>
   The tests will continue through Friday at Fujian Province's
Quanzhou Bay and Shenlu Bay, the Defense Ministry said in a
statement that did not cite its sources.
</P>
<P>
   The Taiwanese military closely monitors China, the island's
biggest military threat.
</P>
<P>
   Defense officials are cautious about what kind of information is
released. In the past, news about Chinese military movements have
caused the Taiwanese stock market to plunge.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, China has conducted similar tests off Fujian's
coast, about 190 miles west of northern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   China and Taiwan have been governed separately since the two
sides split amid civil war in 1949. While Taiwan has dismissed the
artillery drills as routine, China has not wavered in its threats
to reunify with the island -- by force if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   China distrusts Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian, who was once
a vocal supporter of Taiwan independence. However, before his March
election victory, Chen softened his stance, saying he would only
put the independence issue to an island-wide vote if China attacks.
</P>
<P>
   China has in the past used its military to cause tension during
times of political change in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   When Taiwan held its first direct presidential election in 1996,
China tested nuclear-capable missiles near the island's two main
ports, prompting the United States to send warships to the region.

<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Katie Smith scored 21 points and Betty Lennox
added 19 as the Minnesota Lynx beat Utah 86-64 Thursday night,
snapping the Starzz's four-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota (7-4), which had lost its last two games, including
being held to a season-low 55 points at home by Phoenix on Tuesday,
opened the game with an 11-2 run. The Lynx led by at least 10
points for the game's final 33 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second straight game the Starzz (7-6) played without
star forward Natalie Williams. Utah beat Seattle on Tuesday without
Williams, who is sitting out after straining her back on Sunday,
but the Starzz didn't have the offense to keep pace with Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off her worst offensive performance of the season -- 10
points on 4-of-15 shooting against Phoenix -- Smith had 14 points in
the first half as the Lynx led by 21 points at halftime. Lennox
scored all but four of her points in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Adrienne Goodson had 13 points for the Starzz, while Amy Herrig
added 12. Both grabbed seven rebounds.

<HEADLINE> China Nixes Albright Over Taiwan  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright made a
fervent pitch Thursday to Chinese President Jiang Zemin to hold at
least low-level talks with Taiwan in an effort to defuse tensions
across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, who dwelled in her discussions with Jiang and other
senior Chinese officials on an invitation by Taiwan's newly elected
leader for dialogue, said China had more to gain through talks than
through intimidation tactics.
</P>
<P>
   But Jiang, a conservative product of China's bureaucracy, told
her in two back-back-meetings that President Chen Shui-bian of
Taiwan must first acknowledge there is one China, a senior U.S.
official told reporters afterward.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Albright's appeal to Jiang to ''seize the moment''
was turned aside as the 79-year-old Chinese leader held out for an
affirmation Chen said he could not provide as a precondition.
</P>
<P>
   On most other fronts, U.S. relations with China appeared to
improve. Jiang, for instance, thanked Albright for the Clinton
administration's effort to lower trade barriers for Chinese goods.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they discussed the remarkable shift by North Korean
President Kim Jong Il toward reconciliation with South Korea. Jiang
told Albright that Kim is a logical, energetic and very polite
leader, the U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Jiang was quoted as telling Albright: ''The road is still
long before they solve their difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright said it was up to China to choose a level or channel
for discussions with Taiwan. ''There are any number of ways this
can be done, from a lower level to a summit,'' she said at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   The officials Albright said she spoke with before her meeting
with Jiang have doubts about Taiwan's new leader. ''They are
questioning, basically, who he is, what his motives are,'' Albright
said.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, taking a cue from a summit meeting between leaders of
North and South Korea, sent an invitation Tuesday to President
Jiang, saying they should meet ''to shake hands and reconcile in
creating a historic moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright said lowering tensions between the two sides had top
U.S. priority. According to a senior U.S. official, she ''pushed on
the notion of a dialogue'' with Jiang, and Taiwan was ''the largest
piece of their conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen has refused to recognize the one-China principle as a
precondition for talks but has said the issue could be discussed
once talks begin.
</P>
<P>
   Albright reiterated long-standing U.S. policy that there is only
one China. She also advised Beijing that ''more would be gained
through flexibility and shared interests than through efforts to
intimidate.''
</P>
<P>
   While Albright was in Beijing, Taiwan's military announced that
China began live-fire artillery tests off its southeast coast
directly across from Taiwain. Taiwanese officials, however,
characterized the exercises as routine and nonthreatening.
</P>
<P>
   On most fronts, Albright described her hastily arranged
meetings, on her fifth visit to China as secretary of state, as
positive.
</P>
<P>
   She said the Chinese recognized a need to curb exports of
missile technology and she outlined the Clinton administration's
progress in seeking congressional approval for a permanent lowering
of duties on Chinese exports to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Albright singled out China's human rights record and its
activities in Tibet as two areas of sharp disagreement.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's visit provided a chance to accelerate a lowering of
tensions in the region, but top aides stressed the administration
would not relent in its exploration of a defense shield against a
North Korean missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   China, Russia, Germany and other nations are skeptical of an
anti-missile program, saying it could prompt a race to develop more
potent long-range weapons to pierce the shield.
</P>
<P>
   At a Geneva conference on disarmament, China on Thursday renewed
its attack on a U.S. national missile defense, saying the project
creates ''an urgent need'' for a treaty to ban arms in outer space.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the United States is set to announce negotiations
with North Korea to stop the development and export of missile
technology, North Korea's program has progressed to the point that
it poses a threat to the United States, American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   If the talks succeed, shipments to Iran, Pakistan and possibly
other nations could end. Similarly, Albright is pressing for curbs
on Chinese exports, a long-sought U.S. goal.

<HEADLINE> Bodysuits Banned at Olympic Trials  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   FEDERAL WAY, Wash. (AP) -- American swimmers won't be allowed to
wear the latest fashion at the Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
   USA Swimming voted Thursday to ban bodysuits from being worn at
the Aug. 9-16 trials in Indianapolis. The high-tech attire, which
has revolutionized the sport in recent months, will be permitted at
the Sydney Games in September.
</P>
<P>
   American officials were troubled by the prospect of not having
enough of the new-wave suits for the trials, expected to attract
more than 1,300 competitors. Manufacturers are struggling to keep
up with demand as world records keep falling this year -- many to
swimmers wearing some form of the bodysuit.
</P>
<P>
   The board of USA Swimming, meeting by conference call, voted
16-3 to ban the suit for the trials only.
</P>
<P>
   ''The issue of fairness to all participants was of paramount
importance to the board,'' executive director Chuck Wielgus said in
a statement. ''The board had a real concern that the suit would not
be readily available to all trials swimmers in a reasonable amount
of time prior to the event.''
</P>
<P>
   Lenny Krayzelburg, the world record-holder in the 100- and
200-meter backstroke, agreed with the ruling. He has worn the
bodysuit a few times but doesn't plan to use it in his signature
events.
</P>
<P>
   ''If everyone had a fair opportunity to wear the suits, then it
would have been OK,'' he said. ''But if some of us got an advantage
over the other swimmers, then I don't think it's fair. The fair way
to make the Olympic team is everyone racing on even ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Quick, coach of the women's Olympic team and one of the
bodysuit's strongest supporters, begrudgingly accepted the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the interest of fairness, it was probably a good idea,'' he
said. ''I was hoping that our Olympic team would get to try it out
at the trials. But we will wear it at the Olympic Games, and I
think we will have people swimming their lifetime bests.''
</P>
<P>
   Bodysuits have been approved by the sport's international
governing body, which found no evidence they enhance performance.
The swimming competition in Sydney begins Sept. 16.
</P>
<P>
   The American governing body asked four leading suit
manufacturers -- Speedo, adidas, Nike and Tyr -- to make their
high-tech suits available to all swimmers by June 14, giving them
plenty of time to get comfortable in the new attire before the
trials.
</P>
<P>
   But adidas was the only one that met the deadline, forcing USA
Swimming to reconsider its position.
</P>
<P>
   Speedo says its research shows the ''Fastskin'' fabric provides
a 3 percent reduction in drag -- significant in a sport where races
are decided by hundredths of a second.
</P>
<P>
   The Speedo suits were designed by marine biologists with a
textured pattern that they say mimics the effect of sharkskin in
water. Adidas says its bodysuits improve performance by compressing
a swimmer's muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are fast,'' Quick said.
</P>
<P>
   Australians Ian Thorpe and Susie O'Neill wore bodysuits as they
set world records at the Australian Olympic trials last month. Inge
de Bruijn of the Netherlands wore one while setting three world
marks over the past two weeks. American Tom Malchow was covered
when he broke the record for the 200-meter butterfly at Charlotte,
N.C., last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if the suit makes a difference or not, but I feel
faster in it,'' Malchow said. ''Swimming is very much a mental
sport, so you do what you have to do to feel better. Whether it is
wearing designer goggles or a pink bathing cap with flowers on it,
if you feel better with them you will use them.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Speedo wanted to put its product on display at the
high-profile trials. The company issued a statement saying it was
''disappointed with the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We will continue to work toward our goal of providing all
Olympic hopefuls with the opportunity to practice and compete in
the bodysuit,'' said Speedo vice president Stu Isaac, a project
manager for Fastskin.
</P>
<P>
   Speedo officials were confident of being able to manufacturer
enough suits to handle demand at the trials.
</P>
<P>
   ''The suits do not need to be fitted to each swimmer,'' said
Craig Brommers, director of sports marketing. ''You don't need to
train in this suit extensively to feel comfortable with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by USA Swimming raised another issue: Which bodysuits
are banned from the trials?
</P>
<P>
   There are different styles, the most prominent being the suit
that stretches from the neck to the ankles and also covers the
arms. But some swimmers are wearing less, such as a suit that
covers the torso and stops above the knees.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the coming days we hope to get a clarification on what 'new
body suit' means,'' Brommers said. ''They have disallowed the
bodysuit, but we have a myriad of other silhouettes for the suit.
Now, the question is whether we can we make Speedo Fastskin suits
in those other silhouettes.''
</P>
<P>
   Wielgus indicated before the vote that some form of the bodysuit
would likely be allowed at the trials.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to define it exactly,'' he said. ''I think they will
allow suits that go just above the knees and cover the upper torso,
but leave the arms uncovered.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Jochums, who coaches some of the top distance swimmers in
the country, said Thursday's decision puts the focus at the trials
back on competition rather than technology.
</P>
<P>
   ''Good for U.S. swimming!'' he said. ''We were sending the wrong
message to our young swimmers.''

<HEADLINE> Ivory Coast Coup Rumors Spread  </HEADLINE>
By GLENN McKENZIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- Rumors of a coup caused a brief
panic in Ivory Coast's commercial capital Thursday, as shops closed
and residents rushed home.
</P>
<P>
   Communications Minister Henri Cesar Sama went on national
television in the afternoon to tell the country that the rumors
were false and to appeal for calm.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to reassure the population and say that at no point was
there a threat to the people or their possessions, far less an
attempted coup d'etat,'' Sama said.
</P>
<P>
   The scare came amid mounting political and ethnic tensions in
this West African country, which until a Dec. 24 military coup had
long been one of the continent's most prosperous and stable
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers told employees at the national television station that
they had received word of a planned attack and instructed them to
evacuate the building, Ivorian Radio and Television director George
Aboke said.
</P>
<P>
   He had no further details, but a soldier at the scene said on
condition he not be named that an army faction had planned a
takeover. His claim could not be independently verified.
</P>
<P>
   In the downtown business district, shops and businesses closed
and people rushed home.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers in armored personnel carriers -- many of them smiling
and waving -- patrolled the streets and watched over key buildings,
including the national radio and television stations.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, however, calm had been restored and employees
headed back to work. There were no arrests, security officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the December coup was initially popular with Ivorians
who had grown tired of corruption and ethnic favoritism under
ousted President Henri Konan Bedie, many have grown disillusioned
with the new regime.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition politicians now accuse junta leader Gen. Robert Guei
of stirring up hatred of foreigners, who make up about a third of
the country's population.
</P>
<P>
   There is also dissatisfaction within army ranks, where junior
officers say they haven't received the perks they were promised.
</P>
<P>
   Guei has promised elections for Sept. 17 but has not said
whether he will run. A May Cabinet reshuffle which brought more
officers into the government prompted critics to speculate that
Guei was trying to entrench military rule.
</P>
<P>
   International lenders have threatened to withdraw development
assistance to Ivory Coast unless it holds elections. The country is
among the world's biggest cocoa and coffee producers but also has
one of Africa's heaviest debt loads.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Candidate Taking Risks  </HEADLINE>
By MEGAN LARDNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Opponents and supporters of leftist
presidential candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas clashed Thursday at a
Mexico City university during a campaign appearance.
</P>
<P>
   There were no reports of injury as students still angry over the
handling of a strike at the National Autonomous University last
year threw rocks and eggs after massing on the main plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas, Mexico City's mayor at the time and now running for
president, told the crowd that he was also disappointed in the
university's handling of the strike and asked both sides to seek a
solution.
</P>
<P>
   ''It hurts and irritates me that university authorities have
proven to be insensitive, incapable and unyielding,'' said
Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   Initially supportive of the 10-month strike, Cardenas backed
away as more radical students gained control. Strike leaders
accused Cardenas of betraying leftist ideals.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas, who is running a distant third in opinion polls,
promised convert Mexico's largest school into a ''public university
of excellence'' if elected president.
</P>
<P>
   ''One can differ, it's valid, but in the a university this must
be valued, everyone should have the opportunity to express
themselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But his remarks failed to convince some in the crowd. One person
hurled a small explosive near the empty stage and Cardenas
opponents rushed at his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the crowd burned Democratic Revolution Party
flags in a bonfire, while others began throwing rocks and eggs or
brandishing broken sticks. Some students were seen with bloody
noses.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters and opponents of Cardenas accused each other of
provoking Thursday's violence.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas, who is making his third attempt at the presidency, had
accepted an invitation from moderate faculty and students to speak
at the university, 10 days before the July 2 election.
</P>
<P>
   There were no major confrontations leading up to the event,
attended by an estimated 30,000 people. During his speech,
supporters jammed onto a low rooftop, while dissenters gathered
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The strikers' occupation of the university, which ended in
February, began as a protest against tuition increases but later
became a platform to denounce free-market government policies.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Elections Set  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS HAWLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's presidential election --
postponed once because of technical problems -- will be held on July
30, lawmakers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislative Commission also approved that date for the
election of governors, legislators and mayors and set Oct. 1 for
election of regional and local councils.
</P>
<P>
   The elections, aimed at overhauling Venezuela's government and
give life to its new constitution, were originally scheduled for
May 28. But the Supreme Court postponed them because of technical
problems including the omission of some candidates from a database
needed to count votes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is time to get on with these elections,'' commission
president Luis Miquilena said after the vote Thursday night. ''It
is time to get out of this transitory period even if we have to
break the elections in two parts.''
</P>
<P>
   The elections are a crucial part of President Hugo Chavez's
makeover of the Venezuelan government. Every public office in the
country -- more than 6,200 positions -- is up for grabs, making it
the biggest election in Venezuelan history. More than 36,000
candidates will participate.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's allies see the vote as a chance to sweep away a
political system that for decades failed to solve Venezuelans'
poverty despite the country's oil riches.
</P>
<P>
   His opponents fear Chavez -- who led a failed coup in 1992 before
his election in 1998 -- is trying to establish an authoritarian
state.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, an assembly packed with Chavez allies rewrote the
constitution to give broad powers to the president. It then
dissolved the 227-seat Congress and appointed the 21-member
Legislative Commision, a temporary legislature also dominated by
Chavez supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders had wanted all of the elections on the same
date. They feared that if Chavez wins the presidency as expected,
his victory would give momentum to other candidates of his Fifth
Republic Movement party.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the country's National Electoral Council said a
single election date would overwhelm ballot counters and urged
lawmakers to split them up.
</P>
<P>
   ''The (elections) couldn't be done all together in the short
term, as the country had demanded,'' said Elias Jaua, second vice
president of the Legislative Assembly. ''For that reason, it was
more prudent and sensible to divide the elections.''

<HEADLINE> Colorado Wildfires Nearly Contained  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Fires that burned 21,000 acres in Colorado's
foothills were close to being controlled Thursday, although crews
continued to monitor hot spots and watch for flare-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters also were on standby in Grand Junction, Pueblo and
Durango in case any new wildfires erupted.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-nine of Colorado's 63 counties had fire restrictions
Thursday because of the dry conditions that helped fuel the fires
southwest of Denver and east of Rocky Mountain National Park.
</P>
<P>
   The fire 35 miles southwest of Denver scorched about 10,800
acres and burned 51 homes and a sawmill. More than 400 firefighters
remained on the lines guarding against flare-ups.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 firefighters were at the fire east of Rocky Mountain
National Park, which burned 10,600 acres and 22 structures.
</P>
<P>
   Both fires were contained, meaning lines dug around them were
holding, U.S. Forest Service spokesman Lynn Young said. It might be
several days before the blazes are considered controlled, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Both fires started June 12 and spread quickly in the windy,
bone-dry foothills. Authorities first thought lightning may have
started the fires but now believe one of them may have been caused
by a campfire.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of fighting both fires totaled $7.4 million, the
National Interagency Fire Center's Web site said.

<HEADLINE> Hastert Intervenes Patients Bill  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Speaker Dennis Hastert intervened
forcefully Thursday in negotiations on a long-stalled patients'
rights bill, joining in marathon talks aimed at uniting
congressional Republicans on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Illinois Republican told reporters he hoped for agreement by
the end of the night on a GOP bill to strengthen the hand of
patients in dealing with their HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Bargainers met late into the night in the Capitol office of
Senate Republican Whip Don Nickles, who has played the lead role in
talks -- now suspended -- aimed at reaching agreement with Democrats
on the bill. They were joined for the first time by Rep. Charles
Norwood of Georgia, a rebel on the issue who has consistently
advocated a broader series of protections favored by the White
House and many Democrats but opposed by most Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The late-night talks marked the latest turn in a complicated
series of events surrounding the politically sensitive issue, in
which the House and Senate passed widely different versions of the
same bill.
</P>
<P>
   The House-passed bill, which cleared over the objection of
Hastert and most members of the leadership, would empower patients
with a range of protections, including the right to sue their HMOs
for denial of care.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate-passed measure, by comparison, applies to far fewer
individuals, and contains no new right to sue.
</P>
<P>
   Both bills provide guarantees on other items, including access
to emergency care.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts at forging a bipartisan compromise appeared to produce
progress at first, but then ground to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats brought the issue back to the Senate floor
earlier this month, attempting to win approval for the House-passed
measure. They failed, 51-48, and Senate Republicans made it clear
they would turn their attention to trying to find common ground
with House Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, charged at the time that Democrats
were committing a ''cynical political act'' in forcing the vote.
But Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said the private talks thus
far had been ''an endless road to nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert's personal involvement reflects his own long-standing
interest in the issue as well as a belief, often stated in private,
that President Clinton's signature on a compromise measure is vital
for Republicans this election year.
</P>
<P>
   And even agreement among Republicans doesn't guarantee passage
in the House and Senate, much less approval by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Republican sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, say
Hastert has discussed the issue privately with Clinton in the past.
His participation in the negotiations in Nickles' office came after
a series of private meetings, including one with the Senate GOP
whip, one with Norwood, and another with the members of the rank
and file who had been involved in the formal negotiations with the
Senate.

Texas Inmate Gary Graham Executed
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- Gary Graham, subject of the most contentious Texas
death penalty case since Gov. George W. Bush began running for president, was
executed tonight for a 1981 murder he said he did not commit. Graham, 36,
received a lethal injection for the killing of a man in a holdup outside a
Houston supermarket. The state parole board and appeals courts rejected his
arguments that he was convicted on shaky evidence from a single eyewitness and
that his trial lawyer did a poor job.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent Counsel Robert Ray said today that, despite
her denials, there is ''substantial evidence'' that Hillary Rodham Clinton
played a role in White House travel office firings, but the prosecutor said he
won't bring charges because there's not enough evidence to convict the first

came several days after the House adopted a similar ban. Democrats said the
regulations developed by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration could

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers vote Jet Ski regulations; emissions standards  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The state Legislature passed bills on
Thursday to cut emissions from ''Jet Skis'' and to allow
municipalities to limit or ban their use on waterways across New
York state.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of the measures say the increasingly popular personal
watercraft - ''Jet Ski'' is a trademarked name - have become a
noisy nuisance to other boaters and swimmers on some lakes and
rivers. They can also be a danger to their riders if operated
improperly, and environmentalists say they generate too much
pollution and threaten shoreline wildlife habitats when they are
operated in very shallow water.
</P>
<P>
   ''New York's recreational assets and environment should not be
subjugated to the joy-riding whims of a few thrill seekers,'' said
David Higby of Environmental Advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Giving local governments the power to regulate ''Jet Ski'' usage
is the fairest and quickest way to introduce limits statewide,
according to state Assemblyman Thomas DiNapoli, D-Nassau. Such
regulation could include declaring the craft off-limits on some
waterways and to limit the speed they could go on others, sponsors
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some communities don't mind them, in some places they are used
to attract tourists,'' said DiNapoli, Assembly sponsor of the
measure. ''But other communities will want to preserve the
quietude.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Adirondack Council, John Sheehan, said
localities would be able to put local regulations in place far more
quickly than the state could do it.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would definitely take a decade or more to do it centrally''
by the state, Sheehan said.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would apply to all navigable waterways in the state.
Villages, towns and cities currently have the right to limit some
personal watercraft usage, but they cannot ban it entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not a one-size-fits-all,'' said Neil Woodworth of the
Adirondack Mountain Club.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would not allow for countywide ''Jet Ski''
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is also supported by the state Conference of Mayors,
the state Association of Towns and other municipal officials
groups.
</P>
<P>
   The local regulation bill will win final legislative approval
Thursday as lawmakers wind down their 2000 regular session,
sponsors predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Another ''Jet Ski'' bill was also passed by both the Assembly
and Senate Thursday. It would require the state Department of
Environmental Conservation to adopt emissions standards for ''Jet
Skis'' above the federal limits set in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The measure directs that emissions standards created by
California in 1998 should also be adopted in New York. They call
for personal watercraft to be 65 percent cleaner than the what the
federal government is requiring for the crafts.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Robert Boyle, a Suffolk County Republican, said the
emissions' measure goes too far.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're asking for an industry to meet standards that they're
simply not able to meet,'' Boyle said. ''Right now they do not have
the technology. You're asking them to get to a place that they
can't do.''
</P>
<P>
   But Assemblywoman Naomi Matusow, D-Westchester, said personal
watercraft makers do have the ability to make the ''cleaner''
crafts.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists estimate that between 20 percent and 30
percent of the gasoline-oil mixture used to power the two-stroke
personal watercraft engines gets into the water. The air emissions
from the engines is also far dirtier than an automobile's, sponsors
said.
</P>
<P>
   It is estimated that there are 50,000 personal watercraft in New
York and that twice as many people operate those crafts.
</P>
<P>
   The bills represent the second and third major moves this year
in New York to regulate personal watercraft.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the state Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic
Preservation adopted a system to require that everyone operating a
personal watercraft must have taken a safety course by 2004. The
safety course requirement is being phased in this year, with those
between ages 10 and 19 needing to take the class before being
allowed to operate a craft.
</P>
<P>
   The safety courses were introduced in response to the
disproportionately higher numbers of people injured in personal
watercraft accidents than in other types of boating activities.

<HEADLINE> Report: Israel Ready for Concessions  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LAVIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel is prepared to give the Palestinians
part of Jerusalem and all of the strategic Jordan Valley, according
to an American document summing up the negotiations so far, Israel
television reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office dismissed the report as
''baseless speculation.'' Larry Schwartz, the spokesman for the
U.S. Embassy, said he has seen the paper, but ''it is not an
official American government document.''
</P>
<P>
   The television report said Israeli negotiators have told the
Palestinians that they are prepared to grant the Palestinians
sovereignty over the Jordan River, the bridges over the river
between the West Bank and Jordan and the Jordan Valley.
</P>
<P>
   An international force with a large Israeli military contingent
would oversee the bridges, and the Palestinians would lease the
Jordan Valley back to Israel, according to the document.
</P>
<P>
   The report quoted the document as saying negotiators were making
progress in persuading Barak that a temporary solution over
Jerusalem would be unsatisfactory, and that Israel should grant the
Palestinians sovereignty over Arab neighborhoods there.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and Palestinian negotiating teams are trying to hammer
out a framework for a peace treaty, toward a September target date
for completing the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The points in the document go beyond the concessions Barak has
said he is willing to make. He has said that the Jordan River must
be Israel's security boundary.
</P>
<P>
   However, Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh said this week
that Israel must be prepared to give up much of the Jordan Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Barak insists that Jerusalem would remain united under Israeli
sovereignty. The Palestinians want to set up a state with the Arab
section of Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
   An American official, insisting on anonymity, said the document
appeared to be a memorandum of remarks made at a meeting, but it
was unclear who made them. He said State Department Middle East
mediator Dennis Ross, who arrived in Israel late Thursday for talks
with Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, did not know about
the document.
</P>
<P>
   The official said the document was being circulated by Israeli
opponents of concessions to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The TV report said the document was handed to Rabbi Ovadia
Yosef, spiritual leader of the Shas party, just before his decision
Thursday to cancel his party's resignation from Barak's government,
an apparent attempt to persuade Shas to oppose Barak's peace moves.
Shas is hesitant about concessions to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is due here next week
to explore the possibility of a three way summit meeting in
Washington with Barak, Arafat and President Clinton to wrap up the
framework agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Israel must agree to
hand over all of the West Bank, Gaza Strip and the Arab section of
Jerusalem. ''Without this, I don't think we can have peace,'' he
told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Jerusalem Thursday, Barak repeated his view that
both sides must make painful concessions for peace. ''The moment of
truth is upon us,'' he told Australian Jewish fundraisers.

<HEADLINE> N.H. Justice Testifies in Trial  </HEADLINE>
By GENE JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- In his final chance to fight off
impeachment, New Hampshire's top judge said he did not report
possible misconduct by a colleague last year because he was not
entirely aware of it.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice David Brock told lawmakers Thursday that he did
not hear any inappropriate remarks made by then-Justice Stephen
Thayer on a case he was disqualified from deciding.
</P>
<P>
   Thayer resigned from the court after he was accused of trying to
influence assignments to an appeals panel hearing his divorce case.
</P>
<P>
   The state House Judiciary Committee is investigating whether
Brock, Justice John Broderick and Justice Sherman Horton should be
impeached over alleged widespread ethics violations.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses have depicted a pattern of Brock putting the court's
right to confidentiality over the need to report misconduct. The
state's Code of Judicial Conduct requires judges to report
wrongdoing by other judges and lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Brock said Thursday that reporting misconduct trumps the court's
secrecy rules.
</P>
<P>
   Brock was not questioned Thursday about Thayer's conduct in his
divorce case. The committee members focused on Thayer's conduct in
a case he was disqualified from last year.
</P>
<P>
   In the case, the court was deciding punishments for two lawyers
accused of ethics violations. The lawyer who lodged the complaints
had loaned Thayer $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee is expected to vote July 5 on whether
the justices should be impeached, reprimanded or cleared. The House
will vote on the committee's recommendation July 12.

<HEADLINE> White Sox 6, Indians 0  </HEADLINE>
By RICK GANO
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Cal Eldred pitched his first shutout in three
years and extended his winning streak to seven games as the Chicago
White Sox salvaged a split in their four-game series with
Cleveland, beating the Indians 6-0 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox, who had lost two straight after an eight-game
winning streak, bounced back and moved 7&AMP;frac12; games ahead of the
Indians in the AL Central.
</P>
<P>
   Eldred (9-2), who hasn't lost in eight starts since May 10, beat
the Indians for the third time this season. He allowed seven hits,
struck out six and walked two in his fourth career shutout, his
first since beating the White Sox for Milwaukee on May 30, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Durham led off the first with his 12th homer, and the White
Sox made it 3-0 in the second off Chuck Finley (5-5) on a
run-scoring wild pitch and Durham's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Perry doubled with two outs in the scored on scored on Brook
Fordyce's single. Scott Kamieniecki threw a run-scoring wild pitch
in the seventh and Magglio Ordonez singled home a run in the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Finley (5-5) allowed four runs, eight hits and five walks in
five innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Durham hit a leadoff homer for the 13th time in his career.
His right-handed homer was just his second of the season. He has 10
left-handed.. ... David Justice, who has a strained abdominal
muscle, missed his second straight game. ... Jeff Abbott fouled a
pitch off his right knee in the fifth, singled and then left the
game the following inning. ... Eldred's start was his 15th,
matching his total last season with Milwaukee. His career-high
winning streak is 10 games with the Brewers in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Padres' Gomez Examined for Surgery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Chris Gomez of the San Diego Padres, who lost
his starting shortstop job in spring training, had an MRI on his
left knee on Thursday and is due to undergo season-ending surgery
next week.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Nicholson, the Padres' first-round draft pick in 1997,
will be promoted from Triple-A Las Vegas on Friday when Gomez goes
on the disabled list, and is expected to see extensive playing
time. Damian Jackson, who beat out Gomez in the spring, has
committed 14 errors.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez flew from Phoenix to Vail, Colo., on Thursday to have the
knee examined by Dr. Richard Steadman. There's a 99-percent chance
he needs surgery due to bad cartilage, Padres assistant general
manager Fred Uhlman Jr. said Thursday night from Cincinnati, where
the Padres open a three-game series on Friday. Steadman will
determine which procedure Gomez needs after reading the MRI results
a second time on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez will return to San Diego for the weekend, then fly back to
Vail on Monday or Tuesday for surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez underwent arthroscopic surgery on both knees on June 4,
1999, and returned after missing 52 games.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson was the first Canadian to be picked in the first round
of baseball's amateur draft.

<HEADLINE> Report: Ruling on Kennedy Crash Due  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Federal investigators have concluded pilot error
caused the plane crash that killed John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife
and his sister-in-law, NBC News reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board is finalizing its
report, which is expected to be released in the next several weeks,
according to the network.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than use the words ''pilot error,'' however, the NTSB is
likely to attribute the cause to Kennedy becoming ''spatially
disoriented,'' which is when a pilot loses track of the plane's
position in the sky, NBC reported.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB also is likely to point to a host of factors the night
of July 16, when the plane Kennedy was piloting crashed off the
Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard: thick haze, the darkness
of night, and the fact Kennedy was flying over open water with no
lights below to guide him.
</P>
<P>
   But the NTSB is not expected to criticize Kennedy's experience,
and will not address the question of whether pilots without
instrument rating should be allowed to fly at night, NBC said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy did not have instrument rating, meaning he was not
qualified to fly by instruments alone.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's single-engine Piper Saratoga crashed as he was flying
with his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister Lauren,
from Fairfield, N.J., near New York City, to Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB spokesman Terry Williams told The Associated Press that he
had no information about the Kennedy crash report, saying only that
the report will be released in several weeks.

<HEADLINE> Twins 3, Rangers 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Butch Huskey scored from second as a
teammate was caught in a rundown in the ninth inning, lifting the
Minnesota Twins over the Texas Rangers 3-2 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Huskey doubled off Tim Crabtree (1-4) leading off the ninth
before pinch-hitter Denny Hocking walked. Chad Moeller grounded to
second base and Hocking avoided the tag of Frank Catalanotto, who
threw to first to retire Moeller. Hocking was caught in a rundown
on first baseman Rafael Palmeiro's throw to second, but Huskey
alertly rounded third and slid under the tag of Ivan Rodriguez to
give Minnesota a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   LaTroy Hawkins (2-2) retired the last batter in the eighth, and
Eddie Guardado got one out in the ninth. Bob Wells got the last two
outs with runners on the corners for his fourth save in six
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The game turned into a surprise pitching duel when two emergency
starters took a 2-2 game into the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Texas starter Matt Perisho and Minnesota's Joe Mays were forced
into duty because of injuries to both scheduled starters.
</P>
<P>
   Perisho, who gave up five hits and two runs in seven innings,
replaced scheduled starter Darren Oliver, who was placed on the
15-day disabled list Wednesday because of weakness in his left
shoulder. Perisho walked two and struck out four.
</P>
<P>
   Mays held the Rangers to two runs on eight hits before he was
replaced by Travis Miller at the start of the eighth. Mays was
pushed up in the rotation when scheduled starter Eric Milton was
hit in the left hand -- his pitching hand -- Tuesday in batting
practice. Mays walked four and struck out two.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers took a 2-1 lead on Rodriguez's 23rd home run, an
opposite-field, 391-foot shot in the fifth inning. Rodriguez, the
1999 AL MVP, is second in the league in homers. He trails Toronto's
Carlos Delgado, who has 25.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins answered in the sixth when Corey Koskie's bunt single
scored Matt Lawton from third. Lawton singled to start the inning
and moved to third on two infield groundouts.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Coomer's second-inning home run to left, his ninth of the
year, gave the Twins a 1-0 lead. The right-handed first baseman is
5-for-8 with three RBIs career against Perisho.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers tied it 1-1 in the third when Palmeiro singled home
Catalanotto, who singled, stole second and reached third on a
throwing error by Twins rookie catcher Moeller.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Perisho's seven innings were a career high. He went 6 1-3
twice previously. ... Moeller recorded his first major league hit
with a single in the third inning. He made his major league debut
Wednesday after being called up from Triple-A Salt Lake City. ...
Rangers OF Dave Martinez recorded his second straight hit with a
line-drive single in the second inning after breaking an 0-for-20
slump Wednesday with a two-run double in the fifth inning.
Martinez's double Wednesday was the game-winner. ... Texas plays 12
of its next 15 games at home before the All-Star break.

<HEADLINE> Protests at Graham Execution  </HEADLINE>
By C. BRYSON HULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- Protesters burned American flags,
chanted and waved signs Thursday outside the prison in Huntsville
to speak out against the execution of Gary Graham, but a restless
peace prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   After a day of vocal protests and cries of ''No justice! No
peace!'' the tension briefly boiled over for some demonstrators,
who rushed a police barricade shortly before the execution was
originally scheduled to take place.
</P>
<P>
   The incident ended quickly, with eight people arrested by
officers in riot gear. A juvenile was also arrested for throwing an
object at a prison administrator; the official was unhurt.
</P>
<P>
   When word of Graham's execution spread, most protesters were
quiet and somber. Many cried.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, convicted of killing 53-year-old Bobby Lambert during an
armed robbery outside a Houston supermarket on May 13, 1981,
focused national attention on capital punishment and the
presidential candidacy of Republican Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Of the hundreds of people who gathered outside the prison, by
far the most vocal and visible were Graham's supporters, who are
numerous because of his active media presence throughout his years
on death row. Graham maintained his innocence and claimed he was
convicted on shaky evidence from a lone eyewitness.
</P>
<P>
   When word came that the state parole board denied Graham a
reprieve, supporter Ashanti Chimuranga called the crowd with a
bullhorn: ''Brothers and sisters, we need to come together for
this.''
</P>
<P>
   She announced the board's denial, producing shouts of
''Murderers! Murderers! Bush is a murderer!'' against a back beat
of throbbing drums.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who claimed to be Graham's daughter sobbed in the arms
of a friend. While she cried, another protester with a microphone
reminded the crowds of the Los Angeles riots that followed the
acquittal of the police officers who beat motorist Rodney King.
</P>
<P>
   ''This raises the specter of Los Angeles in 1992,'' Houston
activist Travis Morales shouted. ''We must execute the slave
master, not the slaves.''

   Prison authorities took no chances, corralling Graham opponents
and supporters on separate ends of the imposing brick prison. At
one point, around 100 Graham supporters attempted to confront about
20 Ku Klux Klansmen demonstrating in favor of the execution, but
the police presence made it impossible.

   The protesters also marched also out of the prison area and into
the streets of downtown Huntsville, chanting ''Free Shaka
Sankofa!'' Graham adopted that name to reflect his African
heritage.
