<HEADLINE> Mongolian Forest Fires Cause 2.2 billion U.S. dollar Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The disastrous forest and
grassland fires that swept Mongolia between February and May have
killed and wounded 85 people and caused a loss of 2.2 billion
U.S. dollars, a leading newspaper said here today.
</P>
<P>
The "People's Right" quoted a government commissioner in charge
of environment and natural disaster affairs as saying that the
forest fires, which broke out on February 23 and lasted for more
than 100 days, engulfed 2.4 million hectares of forest land and
7.8 million hectares of pasture land.
</P>
<P>
The blazes, the biggest ever in Mongolia, also killed 7,800
head of animals and destroyed 35 buildings, 175 tents, 576 animal
pens and 2,778 wire poles, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
The Mongolian government has spent a total of 993.3 million
tugrik (about 2.11 million dollars) to put out the fires, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
It added that local authorities' failure to take active
preventive measures should be blamed for the break-out of the
fires, and their inability to organize timely fire-fighting
operations added to the burning of the flames for several months.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the people's poor knowledge of fire prevention and
a weak sense of responsibility should also be blamed, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
To draw a lesson from the disaster, the paper said,
legislations have been made to make the prevention and supervision
of natural disasters, including fires, a responsibility of local
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Mongolian State Great Hural (parliament) adopted
on May 28 a law on the prevention of forest and grassland fire,
and made new amendments to the criminal law, which metes out
severe punishment to arsonists.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, U.S. to Launch Joint Exercises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Jordan announced here today that it
will start a 10-day joint military exercises with the United
States in Gulf Aqaba of the Red Sea from June 25 to July 5.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Jordan News Agency Petra, the war
games will be attended by Jordan's army and U.S. marine troops
which will arrive at the south port city of Aqaba on June 21.
</P>
<P>
It is not immediately known how many Jordanian and U.S. troops
will participate in the joint military exercises, which is the
second this year but the first to be attended by U.S. marine.
</P>
<P>
The two countries launched a two-month joint military exercises
codenamed "Eager Tiger" in the kingdom in April, which is aimed at
training the Jordanian pilots the necessary skills to use the
U.S.-made F-16s warplanes.
</P>
<P>
The 16 F-16s fighters, part of U.S. military assistance to
Jordan, will be delivered to the kingdom by the end of next month.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believed that the joint military exercises might
have been decided during King Hussein's visit to Washington last
week.
</P>
<P>
The military exercises as well as the U.S. decision to deliver
the warplanes to Jordan this year rather than next year, they
said, will be part of U.S. effort to support Jordan to play a
role in the future Middle East peace process, since Jordan has
shown some confidence in the new Israeli right-wing leader
Benjamin Netanyahu and the king was the first Arab leader to meet
U.S. President Bill Clinton after the Israeli elections on May
29.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Meets Cuban Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 20 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela today met Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina
and discussed with him ways to promote bilateral relations between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after their talks in Cape Town, Mandela
said without Cuba's support, the struggle for liberation in South
Africa would have cost more.
</P>
<P>
There had been a time when the African National Congress stood
alone against the apartheid state, said the president, adding Cuba
was also assisting South Africa in the transformation process by
sending doctors to ease the shortage in some parts of the country
and through other forms of aid.
</P>
<P>
Robaina, arrived in South Africa on Wednesday, was paying a
five-day official visit to the country aimed at strengthening
bilateral relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, Mandela invited Cuban President Fidel
Castro to pay an official state visit to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Robaina said despite diplomatic relations between the two
countries having been established only recently, relations between
Cuba and South Africa have had a long history.
</P>
<P>
He said Cuba had also experienced difficult times, but Africa
had always ''been with us''.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Bourses to Test Electronic Exchange System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Swiss bankers will carry out a
full-scale test of electronic exchange system on June 29, the
success of which will put an end to the traditional floor trading
of Swiss stocks, local press reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The test will re-run electronically the trading session of June
21. If successful, Swiss stock traders in Geneva, Zurich and Basel
will begin as early as on August 2 to work through computer
terminals in their banks without coming to the exchange.
</P>
<P>
Trading in foreign shares, which represents 8 percent of the
total volume, has been carried out with the Swiss Electronic
Exchange System since last December, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
The project is aimed at enhancing the international
competitiveness of Switzerland as a key financial center for
particularly international asset management. The country now deals
with some 40 percent of global cross-border asset management for
private clients.
</P>
<P>
The electronic system is required to react to a trading order
in less than two seconds for at least 90 percent of the time and
be able to deal with up to six orders each second.
</P>
<P>
Due to technical problems, Swiss bankers failed to introduce
the system for all tradings last year. The delay has made the
Swiss Exchange lose some 1 million Swiss francs (800,000
U.S. dollars) per month over the past one and a half years.
</P>
<P>
Local press said that the total cost of the project is likely
to double the original estimate to reach 200 million Swiss francs,
or 160 million dollars at last.

<P>
BRUSSELS, June 20 (Xinhua) -- European Commission (EC)
President Jacques Santer believes approval of a British program to
eradicate mad cow disease improves prospects of ending a row over
a British beef ban, a European Commission spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
The EU's standing Veterinary Committee agreed Wednesday
Britain's plans to wipe out the BSE (bovine sponfiform
encephalopathy) disease, after London agreed to demands to
slaughter thousands more cattle at risk form the disease.
</P>
<P>
"President Santer was delighted with the result. It is a good
pointer to a possible agreement at the EU summit in Florence," the
spokesman quoted Santer as saying.
</P>
<P>
Britain has been blocking EU business in a bid to force its EU
partners to agree to a framework for a gradual lifting of the ban
imposed late March due to fears that BSE could be transmitted to
humans.
</P>
<P>
The two-day summit starting Friday will examine a blueprint
prepared by the EC under which the ban will be lifted in stages as
Britain meets strict conditions to protect public health.

<HEADLINE> Space Shuttle Columbia Begins Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. space shuttle Columbia
blasted off from the Kennedy Space Center this morning for a
record broken 17-day life and microgravity research mission.
</P>
<P>
Columbia and its seven astronauts hurled off the launch pad at
10:49 a.m. EDT with the shuttle's twin solid rocket boosters
ignited, right on time as scheduled. If fuel on board is
sufficient, the 17-day flight will be NASA's longest shuttle
mission in its 78-flight history.
</P>
<P>
Columbia carries a European-built Spacelab module, which will
serve as a research facility for about 60 investigations. The
U.S., Canadian and French astronauts will conduct 138 million
dollars worth of biomedical, plant, fluid and metal experiments in
orbit.
</P>
<P>
The astronauts will sleep with electrodes, collect blood, urine
and saliva samples, ingest metabolic tracers, test their vision
and perception and endure other tests in an effort to help
scientists understand how the body adapts to weightlessness.
</P>
<P>
NASA views Columbia's flight as a preparation for research
aboard the planned international space station, which is scheduled
to be assembled in orbit beginning late next year.
</P>
<P>
Columbia will land at the Kennedy Space Center on July 7.

<HEADLINE> Canada Announces Sanctions Against Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd
Axworthy announced today that his country will impose diplomatic
and travel restrictions on Sudanese government officials.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken in accordance with United Nations
Security Council Resolution 1054 of April 26, 1996, he said.
</P>
<P>
The UN resolution calls on member states to impose sanctions
against the government of Sudan for its implication in the
assassination attempt on Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak at the
June 1995 summit of the Organization of African Unity in Addis
Ababa, and for its support of terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
"This decision demonstrates concretely Canada's commitment to
the fight against international terrorism. It also underlines our
belief in the importance and the effectiveness of coordinated
international action," Axworthy said.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions Canada will be implementing include: freezing
Sudan's representation in Canada at the present low level of two
diplomats; prohibiting its embassy personnel from traveling
outside Ottawa without prior authorization; denying or restricting
the entry or transit of members, officials, or military personnel
of the Sudan government; and instructing Canadian government
departments and agencies to refrain from organizing or attending
international conferences or meetings in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Similar action is being taken by other western countries,
notably the United States and members of the European Union.

<HEADLINE> US Decides Not to Support Boutros-Ghali's Second Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The United States has informed
U.S. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali of its decision not
to back his bid for a second five-year term as head of the world
body, a spokesman for the U.S. State Department said today.
</P>
<P>
"After careful consideration, President Clinton and the
secretary of state have decided new leadership is needed in the
United Nations," department spokesman Nicholas Burns said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement came one day after Boutros-Ghali indicated that
he, based on "strong encouragement" he had received from some
member states, has an intention to seek a second term as chief of
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Burns said that it is time to begin the process of finding a
new secretary-general for the nearly bankrupt organization.
</P>
<P>
"We need, all of us internationally, to identify someone
capable of reforming the U.N. bureaucracy, increasing its cost
effectiveness, reducing the budget and streamlining the
organization." the spokesman stressed.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the United Nations to play a more active role
in peacekeeping and to make its development assistance programs
for poor nations more efficient.
</P>
<P>
Burns disclosed that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher
had in the last few days conveyed the U.S. position to other
members of the U.N. Security Council, and "in a number of
conversations we have made our point clear to him."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the United States had no candidate,
indicating that there were several capable public figures who
should be considered without restricting a choice to Africa or any
other particular area.

<HEADLINE> Gap in Income Between U.S. Richest, Others Grows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Census Bureau reported
today that the gap between the richest Americans and everyone else
was wider than it has been sine the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
Continuing a trend that began in 1968, the wealthiest 20
percent of households earned more than the 60 percent of
households in the middle class in 1993 and 1994, the Census Bureau
report said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the working class and poor are losing income
or stagnating to a greater degree than at any time since World War
II, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
In 1993 and 1994, the first two years of the Clinton
presidency, the share of national income earned by the top 5
percent of households grew at a faster rate than during the eight
years of the Reagan administration, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The bureau found that between 1968, when the gap began to
widen, and 1994, the share of income that went to the top 20
percent of families increased to 46.9 percent from 40.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
During the same time, the incomes of the working class and poor
families either dipped or remained stagnant.
</P>
<P>
Looking at another way, the report said that the average income
for the top 20 percent of households in the U.S. grew to 105,945
U.S. dollars in 1994 from 73,754 dollars in 1968, a jump of 44
percent after being adjusted for inflation.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the bottom 20 percent of families saw their income
go up in constant dollars to 7,762 dollars from 7,202 dollars, a 7
percent increase during the same period.
</P>
<P>
The increasing gap between rich and poor was discovered by the
U.S. Census Bureau through new methods of calculating census data.

<HEADLINE> Irish President Declines to Run for UN Secretary-General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Irish President Mary Robinson today
ruled herself out of the running to replace Boutros Boutros-Ghali
as head of the United Nations, according to a BBC TV report today.
</P>
<P>
Robinson's secretary was quoted by the report as saying in a
statement that "the president is not a candidate for the post of
secretary general of the United Nations and does not envisage
becoming one."
</P>
<P>
The president's secretary made the statement in response to
speculations after the US said it will not support Ghali's bid for
re-election when his current five-year term expires at the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
The 74-year-old secretary general's decision to stand for a
second five-year term was first announced late Wednesday by a UN
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The Irish president, a lawyer, has frequently been suggested by
commentators as a possible candidate for the job, but Robinson has
always played down speculations, saying that she wants to finish
her term as Irish president which will expires in December 1997.

<HEADLINE> US Trade Deficit Up to 8.63 Bln Dlrs in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade deficit climbed
up to 8.63 billion U.S. dollars in April, partly blaming for
surging oil prices which pushed imports to a record high, the U.S.
Commerce Department said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the department, the April deficit was 7.7 percent
above a revised March imbalance of 8.01 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Oil and foreign cars, the two biggest import items, both showed
big increases for the month. Petroleum imports soared 30 percent
to 5.85 billion dollars as the average price for a barrel of crude
jumped to 19.33 dollars, the highest since the start of the Gulf
War in January 1991. Imports of autos and auto parts rose 4.6
percent to 10.51 billion dollars in April.
</P>
<P>
U.S. exports of goods and services also set a record in April,
climbing 1 percent to 69.94 billion dollars. However, this
improvement was offset by a 1.7 percent growth in imports, which
shot to an all-time high of 78.57 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
For April, U.S. exports of autos and auto parts to Japan rose
14.7 percent to 437 million dollars. But the figure was still
swamped by the 2.96 billion dollars in Japanese auto products
shipped to this country during the month.
</P>
<P>
The overall deficit with Japan edged down a slight 0.2 percent
in April to 4.1 billion dollars. The U.S. deficit with Mexico was
38.2 percent higher to 1.56 billion dollars as imports from that
country set a record at 5.9 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
For the year, the U.S. deficit is running at an annual rate of
98.9 billion dollars, a small improvement from the seven-year high
of 105.06 billion dollars for 1994.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 20 (Xinhua) -- A single-engine aircraft
crashed in southern California Wednesday shortly after taking off,
killing all three people on board, said local news reports today.
</P>
<P>
David Schine, 68, a top aide to Sen. Joseph McCarthy whose
stint in the Army led to the famous Army-McCarthy hearings and the
senator's downfall, was killed along with his wife Hillevi, 62,
and son Frederick, 34, when their small plane crashed, the
Associated Press said.
</P>
<P>
The Beechcraft Sundowner, heading to Palo Alto, went down near
the Golden State Freeway soon after departing from Burbank
Airport.
</P>
<P>
The plane was piloted by the younger Schine, who was an
experienced pilot. The cause of the crash was under investigation.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish-born Mrs. Schine was Miss Universe in 1956. Frederick
Schine was director of the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs for
the Department of Energy. He also had worked in the Reagan and

<HEADLINE> ILO Conference Adopts 1st-Ever Convention on Home Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The three-week International Labor
Conference concluded today with the adoption of a first-ever
international convention to protect home workers.
</P>
<P>
The convention was adopted by the conference, the supreme
governing body of the International Labor Organization (ILO), by a
vote of 246 to 14 with 152 abstentions. Most of the employers'
delegates abstained.
</P>
<P>
The convention will oblige any ratifying member state to adopt,
implement and periodically review a national policy on home work
aimed at improving the situation of home workers, a growing and
often invisible workforce that is largely unrecognized in labor
statistics and unprotected by legislation.
</P>
<P>
Under the convention, the national policy on home work shall
seek to promote equality of treatment between home workers and
other wage earners in such areas as protection against
discrimination, remuneration, occupational safety and health,
social security and maternity protection, training and the right
to organize.
</P>
<P>
In order to subject home work to administrative control, the
ILO convention also calls on governments to include home workers
in labor statistics and labour inspection systems.
</P>
<P>
According to the ILO, the ranks of the low-paid and frequently
clandestine force of home workers are growing in developing and
industrialized countries alike. Women account for the vast
majority of home workers and child labor is often associated with
home work.
</P>
<P>
Delegates to the conference agreed that home work can yield
substantial benefits to employers, workers and national economies
alike. For many workers, particularly women, home work provides an
opportunity to earn an income while attending to domestic needs.
For some professionals, working at home may be even the preferred
option.
</P>
<P>
However, the new convention was strongly opposed by most of the
employer delegates who said that the convention will limit
severely the prospects of the expansion of home work in ratifying
countries.
</P>
<P>
A written statement issue by a group of employers represented
at the conference said the new convention is "a fundamentally
flawed instrument and as a consequence will receive very few
ratifications."

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Closely Followed by Zyuganov in Polls: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Current President Boris Yeltsin
remained the top with 35.28 percent of the vote in June 16 Russian
presidential elections, according to the final official results of
the polls released today.
</P>
<P>
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov won the second place
with 32.04 percent.
</P>
<P>
Retired General Alexander Lebed came third with 14.52 percent.
</P>
<P>
Liberal economist Grigory Yavlinsky received 7.34 percent,
while ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky picked up 5.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
Five other candidates failed to overcome the 1-percent hurdle,
and following are their names and percentages:
</P>
<P>
Eye surgeon Svyatoslav Fyodorov -- 0.37 percent;
</P>
<P>
Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev -- 0.51;
</P>
<P>
Businessman Martin Shakkum -- 0.37 percent;
</P>
<P>
Former athlete Yuri Vlasov -- 0.2; and
</P>
<P>
Millionaire Vladimir Bryntsalov -- 0.16.
</P>
<P>
As the final official data show, a total of 75,744,244 voters
took part in June 16 polls, or over 68 percent of the 108.4
million electorate on the list. Over 75,856 voters were considered
valid. About 1,163 million people voted against all candidates.
</P>
<P>
The elections took place in all 89 regions of the country.
</P>
<P>
As none of the 10 candidates won over 50 percent of the votes
in the polls, another voting is expected on July 3 with the top
two, Yeltsin and Zyuganov, competing for the highest post in the
Kremlin.

<HEADLINE> UK Retail Sales Fall in May for 1st Time in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Retail sales in Britain fell
unexpectedly last month for the first time since January, raising
doubts about the strong recovery in consumer spending promised
this year by Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by the Office for National
Statistics (ONS) Wednesday, retail sales fell 0.1 percent last
month against April, compared with City forecasts of an increase
of 0.4 percent. Sales were up only 2.0 percent compared with the
same month last year.
</P>
<P>
The ONS also revised down its estimates of sales in March and
April.
</P>
<P>
Cold weather was blamed for a large part of the loss of
momentum last month with clothing sales showing some of the
largest falls, suggesting retailers were unable to sell summer
ranges.
</P>
<P>
Some economists predicted that sales would rebound in June as
the weather improved. They said the ingredients for a revival in
consumer confidence, rising personal incomes and a strengthening
housing market were still in place.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales in the three months to May, considered a better
measure of the long-term trend, were 0.5 percent higher than in
the previous three months and were 2.0 percent higher than in the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The May retail sales figures appeared to provide further
vindication of the chancellor's quarter-point interest rate cut on
June 6.

MOSCOW, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
appointed Nikolai Kovalev as acting director of the Federal
Security Service this afternoon, just several hours after he
dismissed Mikhail Barsukov from the post of the security body
chief.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Sergei Medvedev told reporters that
Kovalev had been Barsukov's deputy.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Yeltsin replaced his top bodyguard Alexander
Korzhakov by Yuri Krapivin.

<P>
Among today's dismissed high-ranking officials was also First
Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets. The issue who will succeed
Soskovets will be settled within a few days, a source close to the
government said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on this dismissal, former First Deputy Prime
Minister Anatoly Chubais, who also is a key member of Yeltsin's
election team, said that these steps signaled an end to the

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Uganda Strives to Check Environmental </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 20 (Xinhua)-- The wetland in Uganda acts as
filters of waste before it drains into lakes and rivers, which
occupy 17 percent of the country's area.
</P>
<P>
However, the wetland, occupying an area of about 29,600 sq km
or 12 percent of the country's total area, has also been reduced
in acreage. Threats to it arise from human activities including
grazing, brick-making, cutting of vegetation, rice growing#,and
hunting especially of antelopes and birds. In eastern Uganda,
large tracts of wetland have been turned into paddies while in
Kampala and Kabale District many swampy areas have been drained
for farming and house construction.
</P>
<P>
To deal with the environmental deterioration, the Ugandan
government has begun to take measures.
</P>
<P>
The government in January 1994 started construction of a
large hydroelectric power station with an installed capacity of
200 mw. Construction of another hydropower station with an
installed capacity of 300 mw will begin in 1998. More Ugandans
are expected to use electricity in near future, rather than
charcoal, to cook food.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, 20 percent of the tropical forest estates on the
highland has been designated by the Ugandan government as strict
nature reserves and another 30 percent is being mapped out as
buffer zones, while the remaining 50 percent will be subjected to
normal timber concessions on a sustainable basis.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the government formed a family planning agency to
formulate population policies aimed at reducing the population
pressure on land.
</P>
<P>
The National Animal Genetic Resource Steering Committee was
set up in l994 to pave way for the national program for the
conservation and sustainable use of the diverse animal genetical
resources in the country.
</P>
<P>
In March, 1995, Uganda launched an environmental award in
honour of those who excel in environmental management and
conservation. It is to be presented bi-annually.
</P>
<P>
In February this year, a hotline for the public to report
environment abuse was set up in the country. The same month, the
National Environment Management Authority announced that draining
of swamps for economnic development is no longer permitted in the
country. Meanwhile the NEMA said it has received funds from the
Netherlands to restore some swamps in the country.
</P>
<P>
Besides, workshops on environmental protection have been held
regularly in the country to show people how to use moderate
methods to develop agriculture and stock-raising. For instance, a
journalist workshop on environment was held last February here
with a call to journalists to use the media to expand the scope
of environmental education to the masses.
</P>
<P>
Due to the above measures, the rate of deforestation has
recently decreased in the country. However, other problems like
public ignorance on environmental protection, soil erosion and
loss of biodiversity are requiring the government to make more
efforts to deal with. enditem

<HEADLINE> Convocation of Arab Summit Important Step in Arab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
has reiterated that the convocation of the Arab summit is an
important Arab move to deal with the developments facing the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to reporters following his meeting today with
Jordanian Premier and Foreign Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti, the
Egyptian minister said that both he and Kabariti hope the Arab
summit would reach important results with regard to confirming and
safeguarding the peace process through Arab coordination and
consultation.
</P>
<P>
Leading a Jordanian delegation, Kabariti arrived in Cairo this
morning to participate in the Arab foreign ministers meetings due
to be held Friday in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
On the Arab drive to support the nomination of Boutros
Boutros-Ghali for a second term as U.N. Secretary General, for
which the U.S. Administration has openly withdrawn its support,
Moussa said, "This is an issue of nomination and of a world-wide
election campaign, and we support Ghali as an Arab and African
nominee, and this goes without saying."
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian prime minister said he and Moussa agreed in
principle on the agenda of the Arab summit, basically focusing on
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
On Jordan's reaction to new Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's policy guidelines, which were published Monday,
Kabariti said that "this issue will be discussed in details during
the Arab summit, but we, at any rate, wish to base our stances on
deeds rather than words."

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's New Child Feeding Program to Start in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The 1996/97 child supplement
feeding program (CSFP) of the Zimbabwean Ministry of Health and
Child Welfare begins next month with over 309,000 under-nourished
children expected to benefit countrywide.
</P>
<P>
The 309,347 children represent a 67 percent reduction from the

status report released on Thursday by the ministry's National
Nutrition Unit.
</P>
<P>
Although reasons for a decline in beneficiaries were not

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 20 (Xinhua) -- South African Foreign
Affairs Minister Alfred Nzo and Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto
Robaina signed a joint communique today in Cape Town, committing
themselves to strengthening relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In the five-page document, both ministers stressed the need
for democratisation of the United Nations and its Security
Council and agreed to promote the total elimination of weapons of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The communique said South Africa shared other countries'
concern over legislation passed earlier this year by the United
States' congress which permits punitive measures against
countries trading with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Robaina, arrived in South Africa on Wednesday for a five-day
official visit, said the U.S.legislation is clearly intended to
strangle Cuba economically. But he said no country, no matter how
powerful can tell cuba what to do.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the U.N. reform, Robaina said not only should the
Security Council be democratised but the general assembly should
get back the functions which had been taken away from it.
</P>
<P>
Security council seats should not be awarded on the basis of
how powerful a country was. Millions of Latin Americans and
Africans also deserved a seat, he added.

<HEADLINE> Ghana's Wood Exports to Europe Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The suppression of demand for wood
products from the European countries has caused drops in Ghana's
foreign exchange earnings from wood exports, according to press
report here today.
</P>
<P>
A report from the Ghana News Agency, citing statistics of the
Ghana Forest Products Inspection Bureau, said Ghana earned almost
45.75 million U.S.Dollars from the export of 110,767 cubic meters
of wood products in the first four months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the same period last year, when Ghana earned
67.4 million dollars from the export of 201,147 cubic meters of
wood products, a decrease of 32.2 percent in the value and 44.9
percent in the volume was registered.
</P>
<P>
The drop is attributed to the slow-down in Europe's
construction industry that has a weak demand for wood products,
the report said, quoting the bureau's Acting Chief Executive
Alhassan Attah.
</P>
<P>
Attah said there are now new markets for Ghana's wood products
in Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea and South Africa, while
expressing hope that the demand in the European market will pick
up by the end of the year, especially after the summer holidays.
</P>
<P>
Wood products exported by Ghana include lumber, sliced veneer,
rotary veneer, plywood and furniture parts.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 20 (Xinhua) -- All South Africans will have
to make sacrifice if the country is to reach its goals, President
Nelson Mandela said today.
</P>
<P>
In his speech on his budget vote in the National Assembly,
Mandela said what needed emphasis is that the sacrifice applied
to all and no one should try to exploit the cooperation of others
for narrow selfish interests.
</P>
<P>
Reaching the goals identified for the turn of the century will
require a deliberate investment from all those involved in the
main stream of the economy, said the president, adding investment
entailed a measure of sacrifice and risk.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it is an investment in the future and in
productivity for employers to contribute to the training of the
workforce.
</P>
<P>
To exercise moderation in wage and salary increases is to
invest in greater capital injection, creating possibilities for
hundreds of thousands of people to be absorbed into the
mainstream of the economy, added the president.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 20 (Xinhua) -- About 200 refugees today staged
a protest outside the South African Red Cross Office in
Johannesburg, claiming the South African government was not treating
them according to international standards.
</P>
<P>
The protest coincided with Africa Refugee Day commemorations
hosted by the United Nations High Commissioner for Regugees
(UNHCR) and the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
Association of Refugees in South Africa (ARSA) President Bizuayehu
Alemayehu said Ethiopians in South Africa were not given refugee
status by virtue of the country they came from, which was in
contravention of UNHCR law.
</P>
<P>
Alemayehu claimed Ethiopians were automatically rejected refugee
status in South Africa and no neutral body existed where they could
appeal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ARSA Vice-President Dennis Timwara said 12,000 refugees
in the country lived in bad conditions, and were subjected to
harassment to denied basic rights.
</P>
<P>
ARSA also handed over a memorandum of demands to the UNHCR, calling
for protection against rejected applications, legal assistance from a
neutral body, assistance to relocate to other countries, universally
accepted travel documents, and financial assistance for applicants
who are accepted.
</P>
<P>
However, UNHCR Regional Protection Officer P. Karani said there was
a fine distinction between asylum-seekers and refugees.
</P>
<P>
''Asylum seekers are looking for protection and are assessed by a
fair procedure. Refugees are people whose lives are in jeopardy due
to wars and conflict or who fear human right abuses and have fled
their country looking for protection,'' Karani said.

<HEADLINE> Australian Pilot Sentenced Into Imprisonment in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 20 (Xinhua) -- A regional court in Baidoa set
up by General Mohamed Farah Aidid has sentenced 25 years
imprisonment or a fine of 485,000 U.S. Dollars for an Australian
pilot held last month.
</P>
<P>
The chief prosecutor of Aidid's legal system said today that
the pilot, Justin Fraser, 25 years old, was convicted for
violating the immigration and the civil aviation laws of Aidid's
government.
</P>
<P>
The court has also fined the plane to pay 30,000 U.S.Dollars
while the person who hired the plane was fined to pay 2,133
U.S.Dollars which is evaluated to be the violation of the
taxation laws. If the company that owns the plane, Equator
Airline from Kenya, fails to pay the fine, it will be
confiscated, said Chief Prosecutor Abdullahi Ossoble Barre.
</P>
<P>
Barre said that the pilot has confessed all charges against
him and that he made in Somalia 200 landings in different areas
of the country for delivering the narcotic leaves of khat widely
chewed in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Barre said the pilot did not carry with him any kind of
document relating to his identity, adding ''We are not even sure
of his identity, but he claims to be Australian.''
</P>
<P>
According to Barre, the pilot is currently being kept in
Baidoa where he is healthy and in good condition.
</P>
<P>
The plane which flew from Beletuein where it had delivered
khat landed in Huddor Town in southwestern Somalia on its way to
Nairobi after facing technical hardship which forced it to land
in Huddor. After its landing in Huddor, militiamen supporting
General Aidid surrounded and detained the pilot on May 29 this
year.

<HEADLINE> Iran Lashes out at US for Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Iran today attacked the United
States for passing a law to punish foreign companies investing in
the oil and gas sectors in Iran, terming it as a "monopolistic"
measure.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Mohammadi, spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry,
noted that the U.S. foreign policy has reactionary inclinations
toward economic monopoly in order to confront the international
trade laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
According to a report, the U.S. White House Wednesday voted to
tighten sanctions against Iran and Libya, approving a bill to
punish foreign companies that invest in the Iranian or Libyan oil
fields or violate the U.N. trade bans against Libya.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, U.S. President Bill Clinton would be required
to impose sanctions against any company which invests 40 million
U.S. dollars or more in one year in Iran's oil and gas resources
or violates the existing U.N. embargoes against Libya.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the fact that the U.S. moved against the
direction of the global laws and international economy and trade,
the Iranian official said the U.S. tried to monopolize investment
in the world's oil and gas industries, using this as a lever for
strengthening its power against the world's major consumers.
</P>
<P>
He considered as "vain" the impact of the ratification of the
U.S. law on Iran's economy.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the call of U.S. President Bill Clinton and the
Senate last year for intensification of sanctions against Iran,
Mohammadi said that the international economy and policy are based
on science and cannot not be confronted by threat or sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Licenses Two Private Refineries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Two private refineries, the first
of their kind in Nigeria, have been approved by Head of State
Sani Abacha, which will process a total of 300,000 barrels of
crude oil per day.
</P>
<P>
When the two refineries, reportedly to be export-oriented,
come on stream, the country will have a combined daily processing
capacity of 745,000 barrels, according to a statement signed last
night by Gbenga Onayiga, Press Secretary to the petroleum
resources minister.
</P>
<P>
The country's four existing refineries have a total processing
of 445,000 barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
However, they have been down for a better part of the last
three years for sundry problems, according to industry sources.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the Kaduna Refinery in the north, which has a
daily processing capacity of 110,000 barrels of crude oil, was
torched in 1994, and since then is yet to be restored.
</P>
<P>
For the refineries' inability to fully meet domestic demand,
the Nigerian government has had to import refined petroleum
products.
</P>
<P>
Following recurrent fuel supply problem, the government raised
in october 1994 the price of petrol to 11 Naira per litre from
3.25 Naira.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Sells Gulf Insurance Stake in Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait today sold 20 million
shares of its official stake in the Gulf Insurance Company valued
at 12.6 million Kuwaiti dinars (41.58 million U.S. dollars) to the
International Investment Group during an auction at Kuwait Stock
Exchange Market.
</P>
<P>
The market's director general H. Al-Oteibi told reporters that
three private bidders include Kuwait Foreign Trade, Contracting
and Investment Company, the International Investor and the
International Investment Group which won the auction.
</P>
<P>
He said the selling price of the auction which started at 375
fils (there are 1,000 fils to one dinar), but finally set at 630
fils per share reflected the investors' keenness on buying
government shares in distinguished companies and the success of
Kuwait Investment Authority's (KIA) privatization process.
</P>
<P>
KIA is the state investment arm of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
KIA had a two-stage privatization plan and will offer another
50 million shares for public subscription at a date it did not set
yet, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
IIC managing director Sami Al-Badr, who represented his
company at the auction, told reporters that all market
feasibility studies foresee a boom in the insurance sector.
</P>
<P>
Gulf Insurance Company, a list firm, made a net profit rise of
11 percent to 2.9 million dinars or 9.57 million dollars in
1995. Its earnings per share stood at 26.21 fils in 1995 compared
to 23.60 fils in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has announced plans to sell its holdings in about 60
local firms and to prepare for a second and more difficult phase
to shed state involvement in some public services like water,
electricity and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
KIA said in May that state revenue from its privatization plan
mobilized in 1994 stood at over 350 million dinars ( about 103
million dollars) so far.

ministers meetings due to begin Friday in prepration for the Arab
summit on Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said upon arrival that the summit is a positive and
necessary step at this particular time to embody joint Arab will
in the face of current developments.
</P>
<P>
Sudan looks forward to this summit that would further joint
Arab action and affirm its capability to realize a political and
strategic balance, he said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Sudan-Egyptian relations, Taha said the summit
will provide the proper climate for reducing the differences
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
These differences are, according to Sudan, "passing and
marginal," and do not tough upon the core of strategic links
between the two countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Sudan and Egypt deteriorated in June 1995
when Egypt blamed Sudan for an assassination attempt on Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak in Ethiopia. Sudan has denied the
accusations.

<HEADLINE> Commonwealth Welcomes Nigeria's Willingness to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Commonwealth Secretariat today
welcomed Nigeria's willingness to enter into talks with it over
the issues that led to the suspension of Nigeria's membership
last November.
</P>
<P>
"A response by the Nigerian government was received by the
Chairman of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG), Dr.
Stan Mudenge, foreign minister of Zimbabwe, on May 28," said a
press release by the secretariat obtained here today.
</P>
<P>
"In reply to the Nigerian government, CMAG has proposed that
the dialogue take place at Marlborough House in London, the
headquarters of the Commonwealth Secretariat next week," said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government, headed by General Sani Abacha,
earlier this week expressed its willingness to enter into talks
with the Commonwealth over the criticism of its human rights
record.
</P>
<P>
Last November, Abacha's government hanged nine Ogoni minority
activists on murder charges, arousing international protest and
resulting in sanctions imposed by the west, including the
suspension of its Commonwealth membership.
</P>
<P>
Also reacting to these developments, Emeka Anyaoku,
Commonwealth Secretary General who is also a Nigerian, said: "I
welcome the prospect of dialogue between the Nigerian government
and the Commonwealth and sincerely hope that it will be
productive."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Latest Iraq-UN Confrontation Hinders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The latest confrontation between
Iraq and U.N. weapons inspectors demonstrates that differences
over Iraq's past weapons program remain significant as they will
enable the nearly six years of crippling sanctions imposed on Iraq
to maintain for an uncertain period of time.
</P>
<P>
Not long after Iraq struck an oil-for-food deal with the
U.N. on May 20, a team of 53 U.N. weapons inspectors arrived here
in two groups to carry out their inspection work.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, confrontation, the most serious one during the
past few years of U.N. inspection since the end of the 1991 Gulf
War, took place on June 10 shortly after the arrival of the
inspectors. The Iraqi government refused to allow the
U.N. inspectors to enter five military sites for investigation.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi side said that the sites of Iraq's Republican Guard
to which the U.N. inspectors are denied access are sensitive areas
relating to its national security and sovereignty. But the UN
inspectors believe that these are suspicious places which likely
contain information on prohibited weapons program and they are
authorized by the U.N. Special Commission on dismantling Iraq's
mass destruction weapons (UNSCOM) to inspect them without any
condition set by the Iraqi government.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has proposed that UNSCOM chief Rolf Ekeus lead an
inspection team representing permanent members of the
U.N. Security Council to jointly carry out its mission with the
Iraqi side but the U.N. has flatly rejected the proposal.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq-UN crisis remains unresolved after the U.N. inspectors
pulled out of Baghdad to Bahrain, the base of the UNSCOM in the
Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
Rolf Ekeus, who heads the UNSCOM, is now in Baghdad trying to
seek solution to the current crisis between Iraq and the U.N.. His
talks with the Iraqi side will be tough as there is no immediate
signal that Iraq will compromise over the UNSCOM's demand that
they must be allowed to inspect anywhere at any time.
</P>
<P>
The confrontation has dampened Iraq's hope that the oil accord
signed with the U.N. will produce a positive trend in the
relations between Iraq and the U.N., which is seen as conducive to
Iraq's campaign for a total lifting of the U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Following the oil-for-food deal Iraq lost no time to push for a
total lifting of the U.N. sanctions, saying that the oil accord is
not sufficient but a small step toward a total removal of the
U.N. embargo.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the oil deal, which allows Iraq to
sell 2 billion U.S. dollars of oil over a period of six months to
purchase its badly needed food and medicine, should not be
considered as the beginning of the end of the U.N. embargo because
Iraq's partial oil sale is under stringent U.N. control. The UN
embargo clamped on Iraq has not been eased in any sense, they
added.

<TEXT>
<P>
Since the imposition of the U.N. sanctions after Iraqi troops
invaded Kuwait in August 1990, the ordinary Iraqis have suffered
great hardships. The Iraqi government has been playing the
humanitarian card to win support of the international community in
its efforts to get the U.N. embargo lifted at an earliest possible
date.
</P>
<P>
It has successfully concluded the oil accord with the
U.N. which will undoubtedly ease the acute shortage of food and
medicine. However, it might be a blessing in disguise because the
oil accord based on U.N. resolution 986 adopted in April last year
is believed to be designed by the U.S. to keep the sanctions in
place indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
The United States was under increasing pressure from France and
Russia which favor the lifting or easing of sanctions against Iraq
early last year. And the U.N. was quick to work out the resolution
to stem the favorable trend toward Iraq's demand for a total
lifting of the U.N. embargo.
</P>
<P>
For nearly one year Iraq has rejected the U.N. resolution as a
violation of its sovereignty. The real reason behind the rejection
is that Baghdad wanted the U.N. sanctions to be lifted or at
least to be eased at that time.
</P>
<P>
It feared that the acceptance of the resolution would lose its
momentum in its struggle for the total lifting of the U.N.
sanctions. When all its efforts achieved nothing it turned to the
negotiation over the oil-for-food deal with the U.N. as its
internal economic situation worsens and the authorities can no
longer afford to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with U.N. resolution 687 which ended the 1991
Gulf War, the U.N. sanctions against Iraq could be lifted only
after the U.N. special commission certifies that Iraq is clear of
its long-range missiles and nuclear, biological and chemical
weapons.
</P>
<P>
So far a total of 150 U.N. inspection teams have visited Iraq
but none of Iraq's weapons files has been closed. And the UNSCOM
seems still far from certifying Iraq's clearance in its weapons
areas. The Iraqi government has accused the UNSCOM of trying to
keep the sanctions in place.
</P>
<P>
The latest Iraq-U.N. confrontation has obviously hindered
Iraq's efforts for a total lifting of the U.N. sanctions. The
U.N. weapons inspection work in Iraq is a rather complicated
process.
</P>
<P>
Currently both the UNSCOM and Iraq need to work out a solution
effectively to ensure a smooth U.N. weapons inspection in the
future. For the Iraqi side it has no other choice but to work for
a speedy pace of U.N. weapons inspection. AS U.N. weapons
inspection will continue, there will be a fairly long way ahead
for Iraq to get the crippling U.N. sanctions lifted.

CAIRO, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The military wing of Hamas movement,
better known as "Ezzeddin al Qassam Detachments," has announced
its readiness to cease military actions against the Israelis
provided that Israel ceases aggression against civilians in the
occupied territories and ends attacks on Hamas movement.

<HEADLINE> Dairy Cattle Death Cause Identified in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The East Coast Fever (ECF)
has been identified as a major cause of death for dairy cattle
in Tanga, about 200 kilometres north of Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
The disease is responsible for 37 percent of all fatalities in
the Tanga Small Holders Dairy Development Programme (TSDDP).
</P>
<P>
The information is contained in a progress report of the
Netherlands supported programme presented today to Tanga
Commissioner Hasi Kitine.
</P>
<P>
The report said that even with zero-grazing system and
advertised use of acaricide, the risk to get ECF is still
present.
</P>
<P>
An ECF vaccination trail has been carried out, but preliminary
results indicate that the vaccine strength does not sufficiently
protect dairy cattle against local ECF strains.
</P>
<P>
A follow up trial was planned last September in close
cooperation with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
</P>
<P>
Other diseases affecting cattle include trypanosomiasis and
anaplasmosias, but few animals die of those diseases, according
to the report.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Economic Grows at 3.9 Percent in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Minister of State
in the President's Office Daniel Yona said today that the
country's economic growth rate was 3.9 percent in 1995, below a 5
percent target but higher than 1994's 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the 1995/96 economic survey and the 1996/97
development plan in the National Assembly today in Dodoma,
central Tanzania, Yona said that except for agriculture and
mining, the performance of other sectors was below expectation, a
factor that made the country fail to achieve a 5 percent growth.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural sector grew by 7 percent, above the target
that was set at 5.5 percent, while mining grew at 6 percent, also
above the target of 5.3 percent, Yona said.
</P>
<P>
Other sectors did not perform well due to lack of funds for
raw materials, power, water supply and tools, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
On foreign trade, Yona said that the country's exports in 1995
were valued at 682.9 million US Dollars, up from 519.3 million US
Dollars for the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Although prices of coffee and sisal fell in the world market,
the country saw a good export performance because of increased
sales of non-traditional goods.
</P>
<P>
However, the country's economy was adversely affected by
credit and money growth caused partly by the heavy government
borrowing to finance its budget deficit, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In the 1995/96 period, the government borrowed 86.45 billion
Tanzania Shillings (about 139 million US Dollars) from the bank,
compared with 56.82 billion Tanzania Shillings (about 92 million
US Dollars) in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he expressed optimism on restoration of
macro-economic stability in the country by lowering the rate of
inflation from the present 23.5 percent to below 10 percent
within the next two years.
</P>
<P>
The country's economy is now on the right track, according to
the minister.

JOHANNESBURG, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The scheduled departure of
the South African National Party (NP) from the government late
this month is not the end of an era, but the end of the first
phase of a new era, NP leader F. W. de Klerk said today.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in Cape Town, de Klerk, who is still
South African deputy president, said the NP's departure could
therefore be compared for emotional impact with the 1994 general
election, or the inauguration of President Nelson Mandela on May
10 that year.
</P>
<P>
De Klerk said he is leaving the cabinet with no regrets and
looking forward to his new role as leader of the opposition.
</P>
<P>
He described the regular cabinet meeting held on Wednesday,
the last attended by NP ministers, as a positive one, saying he
was thankful the NP could end its participation on a high note

</P>
<P>
De Klerk expressed appreciation about the words of warmth and
recognition Mandela has uttered towards the departing NP
ministers.
</P>
<P>
At Wednesday's cabinet meeting, Mandela paid warm tribute to
de Klerk and his NP colleagues, and to the NP generally, for

<HEADLINE> FAA: ValuJet Ignores DC-9 Defects Before Plane Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The ValuJet Airline flew
passengers in DC-9's it knew needed repair for more than a year
before one of them crashed into the Florida Everglades that killed
all 110 people on board, a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
report said.
</P>
<P>
The report, cited Thursday in the New York Times, detailed
problems that surfaced after the FAA began an extensive review of
the carrier following the May 11 crash.
</P>
<P>
The report laid out the agency's case for grounding the airline
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
One plane flew with a hole in the engine cowl, which would have
reduced the effectiveness of fire extinguishers had there been a
fire, while another had a hydraulic leak that was evident because
fluid was in the face of the pressure gauge, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The FAA also said the airline returned one plane to service
without inspection after it had been hit by lightning, repeatedly
flew another with a broken windshield, and operated a third
aircraft with a malfunctioning weather radar despite 31 reports of
problems from flight crews over a period of nine months.
</P>
<P>
The FAA said some mechanics were new to aviation and were
unfamiliar with aircraft and it failed to complete inspections
ordered by the FAA following accidents on other airlines.
</P>
<P>
ValuJet agreed Tuesday to pay 500,000 dollars immediately and
1.5 million dollars within 60 days or 10 days after it returns to
service to cover the agency's Investigation costs.
</P>
<P>
ValuJet also agreed that when it does resume service it will
limit operations to no more than 15 aircraft initially. The
carrier operated more than 50 planes at the time of the accident.
</P>
<P>
Investigation is continuing on the May 11 crash. The DC-9
caught fire and plunged into the Everglades shortly after it
took off from Miami International Airport. The 119 oxygen
generators on board the plane as cargo were suspected as the
cause of the fire.
</P>
<P>
ValuJet and Sabretech, a maintenance contractor, each says the
other was responsible for the fact that the DC-9 was carrying
hazardous devices that were removed from other ValuJet planes.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Confirms Greenspan as Chairman of Fed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Alan Greenspan was confirmed
overwhelmingly by the U.S. Senate today to a third term as
chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed).
</P>
<P>
The confirmation, with a vote of 91-7, extends the 70-year-old
Republican economist's tenure at the U.S. Fed by four years until
2000.
</P>
<P>
Alan Greenspan is considered by many as an inflation fighter
who has been credited with helping the nation achieve moderate
economic growth and keep the inflation in low level.
</P>
<P>
A glance at the economic numbers seems to confirm that view.
The U.S. economy entered its sixth year of expansion this spring.
The unemployment rate has been fluctuating between 5.4 percent to
5.8 percent since last year. And inflation has hovered under 3
percent since 1992.
</P>
<P>
"He's like a plumber" and "he's done a very good job", said
Paul Getman of Regional Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa.
</P>
<P>
But the confirmation came four months later since Greenspan was
renominated as the Fed chairman on February 22 by U.S. President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
It was because Greenspan's monetary policy also has caused
sharp criticism from some of Democrats led by Tom Harkin who
blocked a vote in the Senate Banking Committee.
</P>
<P>
They said Greenspan's policies have held the economy too
tightly in check and that the Fed could safely allow faster
economic expansion without risking inflation, because global
competition is keeping a lid on both prices and wages.
</P>
<P>
"This effort to always pull the economy down to fight this
bogeyman of inflation... has made it very difficult for families
to do well," said Sen. Paul Wellstone.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan was named to the Fed chairmanship by President Reagan
in 1987, and renominated by President Bush in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's two other Fed nominees, Rivlin as vice chairman and
Meyer as governor of the Fed, are both confirmed today. They are
considered well within the mainstream of economic opinion and
likely to work well with Greenspan even if they are perhaps
slightly less inflation wary than the chairman.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
gave the Olympic flame a White House send-off Friday morning and
pointed it south to Georgia to continue its trek to Atlanta for
the opening of the Olympic Games to be held on July 19-August 4.
</P>
<P>
Local torch-bearers, Olympic athletes and foreign ambassadors
gathered at the South Lawn to bid the torch farewell.
</P>
<P>
Clinton held the torch for a while and then passed it from
torch-bearer Lang Brown, who works with local homeless teen-agers,
to the next runner, Carla McGhee, who overcame serious injuries
from a car accident to join the U.S. women's basketball team for
the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The president said that every American must summon the Olympic
spirit "to embrace those things that bind us together, never to
succumb to those things that would keep us apart."
</P>
<P>
"In the last several months, we have had to deal with some
different kinds of flames, but it is this flame that represents
the best of the United States of America." Clinton added, in an
apparent allusion to the rash of arson fires at black churches
around the country in the past few months.
</P>
<P>
The torch arrived in Washington, D.C. Thursday afternoon and
traveled through the main streets of the capital to the White
House in the night after several brief celebrations at spots in
the city.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic flame, a symbol of hope and peace, was lit in
Greece March 30 and arrived in Los Angeles on April 27. From Los
Angeles, it began a 84-day 15,000-mile (25,000-kilometer) relay
across 42 of the 50 U.S. states carried by 10,000 U.S. and foreign
athletes, school children, students and community heroes.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: South Asia Enters Satellite Television Era </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 21 (Xinhua) -- After a number of transnational
television networks began to beam their signals to South Asia from
the early 1990s, countries in this region are undergoing a
cultural shock brought by such big names like CNN, BBC and Star
TV.
</P>
<P>
Tanks to the development of satellite technology, people in
this culturally and religiously diversified subcontinent are
voluntarily sharing identical TV programs broadcast from thousands
of miles away without any consideration of their own unique social
characteristics and feelings.
</P>
<P>
From filthy slums in Mumbai to middle-class houses in Karachi
to remote Himalayan villages of northern Nepal, South Asians are
now spending their nights and even daytime before TV sets hooked
up with geostationary satellites through cable operators or dishes
on their roofs.
</P>
<P>
Warnings against western cultural invasion from local social
workers have already been there since the very beginning. However,
most governments in the region turn a blind eye to the increasing
dish antennas under their noses and rising American life style in
their societies.
</P>
<P>
In South Asia, only Bhutan still bans the dish-shaped satellite
TV antennas. But even the situation in that tiny Himalayan kingdom
could be tentative, as technology would soon make satellite TV
receivers small and smart enough to shun government surveillance.
</P>
<P>
The impact of the western pop culture is obvious. Early-age sex
among youths has become a major concern of parents in urban areas
as Hollywood movies and TV dramas are aired on the satellite
channels around-the-clock.
</P>
<P>
South Asia, one of the world's poorest regions and often
neglected by international mass media, has attracted extraordinary
enthusiasm from these international TV broadcasting giants because
of its one-fifth of the global population, which means a vast
market potential for advertising clients.
</P>
<P>
Star TV, a subsidiary of Australian publishing Mogul Rupert
Murdoch's news corporation, is a major attraction in the South
Asian satellite TV market. With its transmitting span covering 53
Asian countries, the Hong Kong-based group wants to dominate the
Asian market through its various channels of entertainment, movies
and sports even dubbed in local languages.
</P>
<P>
Inspired by Star TV's success in South Asia, private TV
operators in India launched several local market-oriented
satellite channels such as Zee TV and El TV in recently years to
compete with the international networks.
</P>
<P>
Even state-owned television stations in South Asia began to
polish their public image in an attempt to win back their viewers
who have switched to miscellaneous foreign channels a few years
ago.
</P>
<P>
India's Doordashan, Pakistan's PTV and Sri Lanka's Rupavahini
have tried to air more chat shows, music and TV serials to catch
up with overseas satellite intruders and the newly flourishing
local private channels.
</P>
<P>
In Nepal, where the state-run NTV broadcasts only seven hours
of boring programs every day at present, voices have been raised
urging the government to invite the private sector to provide
quality TV programming. A local private cable TV operator
reportedly had been permitted to launch a Nepali language channel
via satellite in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as more commercial channels emerge in South Asia and
the government stations provide more entertaining hours, observers
found that few operators care about mass media's social
obligations such as education, spreading knowledge and promoting
mutual understanding among peoples, said an article in the latest
issue of Himal South Asia monthly published in Kathmandu.
</P>
<P>
It called on "progressive groups" in South Asia to work with
policy-makers in the region to press for quality TV programming
with social consciousness through regional coordination.
</P>
<P>
The article, written by a veteran TV worker from India, also
suggested that the regional body South Asian Broadcasting Union
should play a key role in working out common guidelines for TV
programming in all countries in the region.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Urges to Enhance Quality of Party Officials (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking of the basic requirements for qualified Party and
governmental officials, Jiang pointed out that whatever jobs they
take, Party cadres, especially the leading cadres, must all
possess the same basic political quality.
</P>
<P>
The most important, he said, was that they must have the lofty
ideals of communism, stick to a firm and correct political
orientation, be unswerving on the road to building socialism with
Chinese characteristics, and to carry out the Party's fundamental
theories, basic lines and policies in a firm and thorough-going
way.
</P>
<P>
What is more, he said, they should devote their efforts to
putting into practice the Party's sole purpose to serve the people
whole-heartedly, to maintain close ties with the masses of people,
and to safeguard the people's interests.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, cadres should emancipate the mind, seek truth from the
facts, be good at pioneering work and apply in their work the
materialist dialectic working methods and styles, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Fourthly, he added, they should be pace-setters in observing
the Party's disciplines and abiding by the laws, being clean and
honest, carrying forward the style of hardworking, and being
active in fighting corruption.
</P>
<P>
Lastly, they should study and work hard to accumulate knowledge
and experience, and be qualified for their jobs, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang emphasized that the first thing to do in cultivating
cadres is to launch a sustained campaign to urge the cadres,
especially leading cadres, to study Deng Xiaoping's theory of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, as well as
Maxism, Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, cadres should be trained and cultivated in
practical work. It is a fundamental way the Party trains cadres,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Building of leading groups is the central task of cultivating a
contingent high-quality cadres, Jiang stated.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said, whether China can remain stable and full of vigor
depends on a healthy growth of the new generation and young cadres.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that Party's young cadres and leading
officials learn from the pace-setters and model workers, and work
even harder to make new achievements in their own posts.
</P>
<P>
Hu Jintao, member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and other
12 representatives, who have distinguished themselves in their
work, spoke at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Hu, also member of the secretariat of the CPC Central
Committee, said the whole Party must rally closely around the
Central Party Committee with Jiang as its core, carrying out the
Party's fine working style and struggling hard to achieve the
cross-century goals.

<HEADLINE> Expert Says Technology Needed to Increase Rice Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese agricultural expert
today suggested the government concern itself more with the
development of agro-technology to ensure China's food supply lasts
through the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
Huang Jikun, in a research report titled "China's Rice towards
the 21st Century," said that technological advancement was, is and
will be, the key to rice output increase.
</P>
<P>
Rice plays an important role in China's grain production, the
report said, quoting statistics that the planting area of rice
accounts for 30 percent of China's total grain acreage.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that the increase of per hectare output of
rice will be the only outlet for grain production, and the road to
improvement lies in upgrading technology.
</P>
<P>
However, it noted that increasing the planting area of rice is
becoming more difficult, while farmers' enthusiasm for planting
rice may drop with the increase of labor costs and the decrease of
comparative returns of grain production.
</P>
<P>
During the past 17 years, the contribution made by
technological upgrading accounted for 96 percent of the rice
output increase, while that by price factors was only 2
percent. At the same time, the prices of means of production,
including chemical fertilizer and pesticides, outgrew grain prices.
</P>
<P>
Huang also noted that China's economic strength and large rural
population make high subsidies for rice production impossible.
</P>
<P>
He predicts that research done on 40 factors that handicap rice
per ha output will lead to increase by a large margin in the next
20 years.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has formed a complete research network to
study rice production, but the scarcity of input into research has
hindered the processing of research data.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in the past five years, the investment in
rice technology in 16 major rice research institutes decreased by
eight percent each year on average.
</P>
<P>
He warned that if investment in agricultural technology could
not be increased, the country's self-sufficiency rate would be
decreased by several percentage points by the end of the century.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets Botswana Vice-President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
today that China treasures its traditional friendship with
Botswana, adding that bilateral friendly relations have great
vitality.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remark at the Great Hall of the People during a
meeting with Botswana Vice-President Festus Mogae.
</P>
<P>
Extending a welcome to Mogae who has visited China three times,
Jiang said that Mogae, an old friend of the Chinese People, has
done much for the consolidation and development of Sino-Botswana
traditional friendship.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he is convinced that Mogae's current visit to China
will enhance mutual understanding and friendship, and push forward
the development of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Noting that bilateral relations have been developing steadily
since the two sides forged diplomatic relations 21 years ago,
Jiang noted that the friendship built between the two countries on
the basis of mutual respect and trust, equality, and reciprocity,
has stood the test of changes, and enjoyed great vitality.
</P>
<P>
China is ready to explore new ways for bilateral economic
cooperation and to further develop bilateral friendly ties along
with Botswana, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Recalling his first to Africa last month, Jiang said that
although China and Africa are far away from each other, he could
feel that the hearts of both the Chinese and African people are
beating together.
</P>
<P>
He said he made clear, in his speech delivered at the
headquarters of the Organization of African Unity on Sino-African
friendship, particularly the principles that China is willing to
consolidate and develop 21st-century-oriented, long-term, stable
and all-round cooperative relations with Africa, under the new
situation.
</P>
<P>
Those principles, which received agreement and appreciation
from representatives of the six African countries included in his
African tour and many other African countries, can be summarized
as equal treatment, sincere friendship, unity, cooperation, and
common development, added Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He voiced the conviction that with joint efforts of both sides,
Sino-African friendship and cooperation will be further
consolidated and developed.
</P>
<P>
He said that during that visit, he witnessed the great efforts
made by African people for peace, stability and economic
development, and the remarkable achievements they have acquired.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the vast changes in the international situation
after the Cold War brought about a tremendous impact on Africa,
Jiang pointed out that the most difficult period for Africa has
passed.
</P>
<P>
Africa is entering a new era characterized by pursuit of
stability and development, and Africa's future is bright, added
Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Mogae said that he has engaged in promoting the development of
bilateral relations over the years, and seen China's assistance
to southern Africa, as well as the whole Africa at large.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that since the two countries established
diplomatic ties, Botswana has received China's aid in various
fields and bilateral relations have been developing smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Mogae stated that Botswana supports China for its position on
Hong Kong and Taiwan issues and adheres to the "one China" policy.
</P>
<P>
China's advocation for equality of countries, no matter big or
small, has received comprehensive supports and appreciation
internationally, said Mogae.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Urges to Enhance Quality of Party Officials (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Party leader Jiang Zemin
today called for efforts to cultivate and enhance the quality of
Party and governmental officials.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Central
Committee, was speaking at a meeting held in the Great Hall of
People here today to mark the 75th anniversary of the founding of
the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
Jiang laid emphasis on ensuring a smooth development of the
country's reforms and construction, guaranteeing a successful
achievement of cross-century goals, and securing a long period of
peace and stability of the Party and the country.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed the need to redouble efforts to strengthen the
building of a contingent of high quality cadres and improving the
quality of all cadres, especially leading officials, saying it is
a major task for the whole party that "brooks no delay."
</P>
<P>
Hu Jintao, member of the standing committee of the CPC
Political Bureau, presided over today's meeting, which was
attended by other top Party and government leaders,
representatives of outstanding leading officials and party members
from all over the country, and trainees from the Central Party
School.
</P>
<P>
"We've got one basic piece of experience over the past 75
years, that is, any success of our course led by the Party needs
not only the correct theories and lines, but also a contingent of
high quality cadres who can firmly implement the Party's theories
and lines," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
It is extremely important and urgent to strengthen the building
of a contingent of high quality cadres in such an important
historical period, as the Party and the nation have devoted their
efforts to building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and to
realize an all-round revitality of the nation, he said.

<HEADLINE> SADC Trade Protocol to Be Signed in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Southern African Development
Community (SADC) member states are expected to sign a trade
protocol in the Lesotho capital of Maseru in August to encourage
free trade in the region.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe national chamber of commerce president Danny Meyer
said here Thursday that the signing of the trade protocol would
be preceded by a one-day conference to be held in the northern
Zimbabwe resort town of Kariba on June 27 to clarify the
protocol's significance.
</P>
<P>
''People have a misconception that all trade problems will be
solved by the signing of the trade protocol. The conference will
highlight the opportunities, the pitfalls and the benefits of the
trade protocol as we want every businessman in the country to
benefit,'' said Meyer.
</P>
<P>
The immediate focus of the trade protocol is to remove all
tariff and non-tariff barriers in the region to encourage free
movement of capital, goods and people, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meyer pointed out that trade in the region was disappointingly
low while progress in encouraging it is slow.

<P>
NAIROBI, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Armed cattle rustlers have
attacked a village in Isiolo District, killing 13 people and
stealing more than 400 goats and camels.
</P>
<P>
Among the dead in the attack Thursday was an administration

<HEADLINE> HK Sends More Journalists Than Athletes to Atlanta Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will send 14 male and
nine female athletes for nine sports at the coming summer Olympic
Games in Atlanta, it was announced here today.
</P>
<P>
And also to be flying to Atlanta are 19 press journalists and a
lot more from the local electronic media.
</P>
<P>
The 23 Hong Kong athletes will take part in 11 Olympic events
on the program of the Atlanta Games, in which the athletes have
either qualified or been awarded with wild cards. But with
officials, the Hong Kong Olympic Games delegation will stand at 49
persons all together.
</P>
<P>
A. de O. Sales, president of the Hong Kong Amateur Sports
Association and Olympic Committee, described the Hong Kong team as
"a very good team, a lean team". "It's very hard because it is
not easy for them to qualify. Since they've qualified, I gave
them full marks," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sales declined to predict how Hong Kong athletes will perform
or what they have targeted at Atlanta. "Only time will tell," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"I expect the Hong Kong team to do as well as they are capable
of doing. If they do better, we'll be happy," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If somebody gets into a final, we are very happy. If somebody
gets a medal, we are even happier," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he stood by his earlier remarks that Hong Kong had never
been closer to getting a first ever Olympic gold medal, most
probably in the event of wind surfing. "I said so before, judging
by the performance throughout the world," Sales confirmed.
</P>
<P>
The sport chief disclosed that there will be incentive awards
for medal winners back from the Olympics. But the awards will be
given by Hong Kong's respective sports associations.
</P>
<P>
Sales called on people not to forget those behind the success
of the Olympic athletes. "The public must not forget that behind
every competitor there are coaches, trainers, team managers,
doctors, physiotherapists, and there are administrators, and above
the administrators there are the decision-makers and
officials. And these are the people who, for generations of
competitors, have built up the teams," Sales said.

<HEADLINE> Radar Provides Inside Picture of Violent Tornado </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Scientists have taken the first
picture inside a violent tornado by a special radar, revealing an
unusual downward flow at its heart, said a report published today
in the journal Science.
</P>
<P>
The pencil-thin beam of the mobile radar helped three U.S.
professors of the University of Oklahoma look inside a tornado for
10 minutes as it swept through Dimmit in the southern U.S. state
of Texas, at a speed of up to 15 meters a second.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the team's radar outlined a 200-meter-wide
eye relatively free of debris and rain, a ring of high radar
reflectivity 200-300 meters around it, and a "debris shield."
</P>
<P>
It also mapped a truncated cone that spread out to be 400
meters across at a height of 1,000 meters. The cone was kinked
because the foot of the vortex dragged along the ground.
</P>
<P>
After a few minutes, the radar showed that new structures
developed, including concentric rings of radar reflectivity around
the eye, which they speculate may correspond to dust and rocks
being sorted according to size by the spiraling winds.

Rescue workers were drafted in to search for victims and reach
thousands of people stranded by the swollen rivers.

Floods disrupted electricity supplies and telecommunications,
cut off highways and railways as well as submerged farmlands,
according to newspaper reports.
</P>

Officials said the weather conditions in the area had improved
overnight and it had stopped raining.
</P>
<P>
Initial estimates have put the damage at billions of
U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Protests against Turkish Warplanes' Flight over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government has made
strong representations to the U.N. and foreign governments
against the flight of Turkish warplanes over the island today.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' Defense Minister Costas Eliades said the flights of
Turkish warplanes were part of the Turkish military exercise,
code-named "Toros", which has been going on since last Monday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said in one case the Turkish fighters crossed
about 300 meters into the southern government-controlled part of
the island.
</P>
<P>
The minister's statement was confirmed by some residents in
Nicosia, who witnessed this morning low-altitude flights by
Turkish warplanes which crossed into the government-controlled
part of the divided Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
However, Eliades said that there is no cause for alarm and
stressed that both the political and military authorities of Cyprus
were taking the necessary measures.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the flight of the Turkish warplanes over the island
has been protested by the U.N. Peace-Keeping Force in Cyprus
(UNFICYP).
</P>
<P>
Waldemar Rokoszewski, spokesman for the UNFICYP, was quoted
today as saying that the Turkish fighters overflew the
U.N.-controlled buffer zone twice. "This matter has been strongly
protested," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Turkish sources, two F-4 fighters took part in
today's military exercises and launched mock attacks in the area
between Pentadaktylos Mountain and the airport of Tympou (Ercan)
in the Turkish-controlled part of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot press reported that two Turkish F-16 jets
launched similar attacks Thursday in an area northeast of
Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot south and the
Turkish Cypriot north since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded and
took control of the northern third of the island following an
Athens-backed coup.

<HEADLINE> New Analysis: Arab Summit Aimed at Forging United </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The Arab summit, the largest
gathering of Arab leaders in six years, is aimed at forging a
common Arab stand to support the Middle East peace process based
on the principle of "land-for-peace."
</P>
<P>
Though Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and a number of Arab
officials have denied that the summit was called in reaction to
the new Israeli government, the tough stand of Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the peace process is apparently the
main reason for Arab leaders to meet at this particular time.
</P>
<P>
The two-day summit, which draws 21 of the 22 members of the
Cairo-based Arab League, will open Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who was elected prime minister in the Israeli
elections late last month, has vowed to take a tougher line than
that of his predecessor Shimon Peres in Israel's peace
negotiations with its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
In his policy statement Tuesday, Netanyahu reiterated that his
new government will not accept an independent Palestinian state
with Jerusalem as its capital, will not return the Golan Heights
to Syria and will not even discuss the future status of Jerusalem
with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Arab states feared that Netanyahu's hardline policy would
jeopardize the Arab-Israeli peace process based on the principle
of land for peace.
</P>
<P>
In this time of crisis, as what Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdul-Meguid said, the Arabs stand together. "The situation
is seriously threatening the peace process and we should work to
maintain the momentum and accelerate the peace process," he said.
</P>
<P>
The summit is a message that "the Arabs will not accept
anything but the principle of land-for-peace," said the Arab
League chief.
</P>
<P>
The Arab leaders, after their two-day meeting, are expected to
issue a statement to voice Arab states' keenness on continuing the
peace process and urge the Israeli government to honor the
principle of "land-for-peace."
</P>
<P>
Reviving Arab solidarity, an issue which is interrelated with
that of supporting the Middle East peace process, will be the
other main purport of the summit, the first since Arab leaders met
on August 10, 1990, when the Arab world split over Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait.

<TEXT>
<P>
Over the past few years, a number of Arab leaders have called
for overcoming the aftermath of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait to close
Arab ranks in the face of new regional and international
challenges.
</P>
<P>
Arab leaders have hailed the summit as the first step toward
Arab solidarity, but the absence of Iraq from the gathering
suggests that realizing the goal still has a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
Iraq was not invited to participate in the summit apparently
because the deep rifts ensuing from the Gulf crisis have not been
healed yet.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said that Baghdad is excluded to avoid any snags that
could impede the convocation of the long-awaited summit.
"Undoubtedly, the situation is extremely sensitive and the wounds
of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait haven't been healed yet."
</P>
<P>
However, there is hope for resolving other inter-Arab disputes
like Syria's estranged relations with Jordan and the Palestinians
for signing separate peace accords with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Sudan has also pinned hopes on the summit to improve relations
with Egypt, which has accused Sudan of supporting terrorism and
plotting the foiled assassination attempt on Mubarak's life last
year. But it seems that Egypt has not been ready to reconcile with
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The goal of realizing Arab solidarity becomes a more uphill
task as it is surely impossible for the summit to discuss and
resolve all issues of the Arab world within a short period of two
days.
</P>
<P>
But holding the summit after six years of division is in itself
quite an accomplishment. As Nabil Fahmy, political advisor to
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, put it, the summit reflects
the fact that there are common interests in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
It may lay a foundation and develop a real process for "better
Arab-Arab cooperation and coordination," he said.

<HEADLINE> HK Museum Charges to Be Cut to Attract Back Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Urban Council has
decided to cut admission fees of its top museums one day per week
from next month on, according to a local press report.
</P>
<P>
The 10 HK dollar charges at the Museum of Art, the Museum of
History and the Space Museum, and the 25 HK dollar admission fee
to the Scientific Museum will be waived every Wednesday for the
next six months in an attempt to attract back visitors,
English-language newspaper South China Morning Post reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Members of the council's Museum Select Committee demanded the
trial due to the falling attendances.
</P>
<P>
Attendances at the Museum of Art fell from 155,390 in 1993 to
147,114 in 1994 and similar falls were recorded at other museums.
</P>
<P>
The original Committee proposal for a free day on Saturday or
Sunday was turned down by the Urban Services Department for fear
that too many people might turn up and the crowds would be hard to
control.
</P>
<P>
And the department was also concerned that profits would be
lost since the weekends were normally the museums' busiest times,

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 21 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong Province
has had good results in developing agriculture with science and
technology in recent years, and pulled in 2.46 billion US dollars
in foreign investment at just one agricultural investment
conference last May.
</P>
<P>
The key to the sector's attractiveness lies in its high yields,
high quality, and high efficiency. Last year it put 6.8 million
yuan into agricultural to finance 110 technological renovation
projects.
</P>
<P>
Results have been achieved in a series of non-traditional
cultivation methods for vegetable and fruits and in organic
vegetables.
</P>
<P>
Many new species of fruits vegetables have been cultivated in
rural areas of the Zhujiang River Delta, and farmers in northern
and western parts of the province have become prosperous by
cultivating vegetables out of season.
</P>
<P>
The provincial Science and Technology Commission has begun 163
projects across the province, increasing the production of hybrid
rice by about ten percent and upgrading its quality greatly. A
series of cultivation bases have been set up, such as one in
Gaozhou City, a dry-planting rice base in Yingde and Heyuan
cities, an organic vegetable base in Conghua, and an experimental
soil base in Dongguan.
</P>
<P>
The co-operation among the Provincial Science and Technology
department, the agricultural department, and the Science and
Technology Association has greatly helped the province's
agriculture, as has the support from the provincial government.
</P>
<P>
The province decided to allocate 50 million yuan annually for
the development of agriculture in 1995, and the provincial
Agricultural Bank has set up a special fund of two billion yuan to
support agriculture.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are over 100,000 (6,666 ha) of ginkgo trees
in Nanxiong, with production hitting 100 tons. A good variety of
Japanese chestnuts has been successfully brought to Heyuan and
Yangshan, and dozens of places have begun to raise
ostriches. Several dozen counties are raising soft-shelled

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Japanese businessmen will
enhance their presence in Hong Kong in the years to come, said
Yoshiaki Ishii, chairman of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and
Industry in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, he said that Hong Kong has many
favorable conditions to Japanese businessmen and he believed that
the conditions will be maintained beyond 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to the chamber, the number of Japanese firms which
invested in Hong Kong has since 1988 increased at an annual rate
of 14.5 percent. In 1994, the number rose to 2,197.
</P>
<P>
By 1995, total investment from the Japanese firms had reached
14.28 billion US dollars, accounting for 2.9 percent of Japan's
overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
In tourism sector, he said, Japanese visitors to Hong Kong came
to 1.69 million in 1995, accounting for 16.6 percent of total
visitors here.
</P>
<P>
Yoshiaki Ishii said that Japan and Hong Kong have formed very
close business ties and Japanese firms have achieved remarkable
progress in their business here.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong's attractiveness lies in its convenient
geographic location to China.
</P>
<P>
In fact, he said, many of the Japanese companies stationed in
Hong Kong are aiming at the vast China market.
</P>
<P>
He said that Japanese businessmen also favor Hong Kong's free
economic frame including people's free entry and departure, free
circulation of funds and no tariffs on most of the commodities.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong also has fine infrastructure facilities
involving telecommunications and communications, airport and
container ports.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the past, only large-sized Japanese companies
came to do business in Hong Kong, but in recent years, lots of
medium- and small-sized firms have also come to invest because
Hong Kong's appeal to Japanese businessmen is on the increase.
</P>
<P>
He said that after 1997 when Hong Kong returns to China, Hong
Kong will continue to be an important international economic
center and Japanese companies will attach more importance to their

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM: Arab Leaders to Try to Protect Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
said here today that the Arab leaders who are to meet here Saturday
will call on a resumption of the Middle East peace process and
protect it from suffering setbacks.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference following a meeting of Arab foreign
ministers, Moussa said that the peace process must continue to be
based on the principle of the land-for-peace formula.
</P>
<P>
He said that a draft communique worked out at the meeting for
the two-day Arab summit would urge Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu to accept the principle.
</P>
<P>
On Netanyahu's policy statement that Israel will hold
negotiations with the Arabs without preconditions, Moussa said
that there are principles, agreements and signed documents which
constitute the bases, or preconditions, for the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"What we are trying to do and what we are going to do is to
call for the resumption of the peace process, to protect the peace
process and to respect the principles on which the peace process
is based," he said.
</P>
<P>
Responding to questions, Moussa said that he hopes Israel's
position on peace can be changed into a positive one so that the
peace process can continue.
</P>
<P>
"Peace is not only for the Arabs, but also for the Israelis,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Let us pin our hopes on the forces of peace to support the
continuation of the peace process," he added.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who was elected prime minister late last month, has
said that his new government will not allow the establishment of a
Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital, will not return
the Golan Heights to Syria and will not even discuss the future
status of Jerusalem with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Arab foreign ministers held the meeting here today to prepare
for the Arab summit, which Arab leaders said is aimed at closing
Arab ranks and forging a united Arab stand to support the peace
process based on the principle of land-for-peace.
</P>
<P>
Asked on his prediction about the summit, Moussa said, "There
will be very good discussion about the situation in the area, in
the Arab world, in particular the peace process."
</P>
<P>
"We will do all what we can in order not to kill the peace
process or to subject it to a setback," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that "there will be no messages of threats or
warning" to Israel. "But there will be a very clear position that
it takes two parties to establish peace and save the peace
process," he said at the press conference at the Foreign Ministry,
where the meeting of Arab foreign ministers was held.
</P>
<P>
Besides the main issues of Arab solidarity and the peace
process, other topics to be discussed at the summit include
Jerusalem, Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
Palestinian refugees, Iraq's role in the Arab world, terrorism and
relations between the Arabs and Turkey, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
He said that 15 heads of state will attend the summit,
which draws 21 of the Arab League's 22 members. Iraq, whose invasion
of Kuwait in 1990 split the Arab world, was not invited to the
largest gathering of Arab leaders since the 1991 Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
Moussa admitted that there are still differences in the Arab
world, but he said that the Arabs will succeed in overcoming them.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has tightened security at the airport and hotels where
Arab leaders are to stay. Policemen are also seen lining main
streets, especially around the Foreign Ministry and the
Chinese-built Cairo International Convention Center, where the
summit is slated to take place.
</P>
<P>
National flags of Arab countries were seen fluttering at the
airport and the streets around the conference center as the host
Egypt is getting ready for the summit.

<HEADLINE> Zhejiang Launches Campaign to Reclaim Land from Seas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Residents in Yuhuan County,
located on an island in east China's Zhejiang Province, know
better than most the Chinese saying "from seas into mulberry
fields".
</P>
<P>
Three quarters of the families in Yuhuan are living on land
reclaimed from the sea.
</P>
<P>
Now Taizhou City, where Yuhuan is located, has launched a new
round of schemes to reclaim even more land from the sea and tidal
areas.
</P>
<P>
The city accounts for one-third of the province's
coastline. Since the 1980s, the city has transformed 15,000
hectares of tidal area into arable land, which has yielded more
than 300 million yuan worth of output value for agricultural
products and two billion yuan worth for industrial products.
</P>
<P>
The city has used various means of attracting investment in the
reclamation effort. Sanmen and Yuhuan counties have introduced
12.7 million US dollars worth of World Bank loans for
reclamation work.

<HEADLINE> Indian Opposition Predicts Early Polls Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP), India's largest opposition, today urged all its units to
stay alert to the possibility of new general elections within a
year, the Press Trust of India reported.
</P>
<P>
Normally the next polls should be due in the year of 2001 but
they may take place much earlier, most probably in 1997, BJP
President L.K. Advani said at a crucial three-day BJP National
Executive Meeting starting in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, this
morning.
</P>
<P>
"It is obvious that the severely-fractured nature of the
present Lok Sabha (lower house of parliament) makes yet another
early Lok Sabha election inevitable," Advani said.
</P>
<P>
In an obvious reference to the BJP not getting an absolute
majority on its own in the present Lok Sabha, Advani said, "Let's
expand rapidly into new geographical and social bases and fill up
the vacuum created by Congress (party) disintegration."
</P>
<P>
The Lok Sabha elections from April 27 to May 7 gave a fractured
mandate with a hung parliament in which none of India's political
forces won a clear majority.
</P>
<P>
The 13-party United Front, with a strength of only 190 seats in
the 545-seat Lok Sabha, assumed office on June 1 with outside
support from the Congress Party after forcing the resignation of
the BJP minority government at the end of May.
</P>
<P>
However, the United Front government would also collapse should
the Congress Party withdrew its support.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The China National Defense News
today called on the country's press and publishing departments to
wipe "cultural pollution" with a tint of colonialism from the
cultural market.
</P>

the Chinese people's dignity, the newspaper said in a news story
entitled "Assailing Colonial Culture Represents a Sacred Duty of
the News Media".

At a seminar held by the newspaper to discuss the re-appearance
of colonial culture, some personalities noted that along with

appeared on the markets and the government should adopt effective
measures to eliminate the trend.
</P>

At the meeting, representatives from the People's Daily, the
Central People's Broadcasting Station and the Liberation Army

FLORENCE, Italy, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the 15 European
Union member countries met today as the semi-annual EU summit
convened to discuss urgent matters.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting will deal with issues of unemployment,
economic slowdown, treaty review and coordination in political and
economic integration.
</P>
<P>
European Commission President Jacques Santer and European
Parliament speaker Claus Hansch attended the opening ceremony of
the summit which was presided over by Prime Minister Romano Prodi
of Italy, now serving the rotating presidency of the union.
</P>
<P>
But prior to the opening ceremony, Santer, Prodi and British
Prime Minister John Major met for a 40-minute session to discuss
the mad cow disease and British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
The issue of mad cow disease had not been included in the
original agenda of the Florence summit but had to be given a
special treatment as most feared that it might adversely affect
the solidarity of the 15-nation alliance.
</P>
<P>
Most member states had said that they would not allow the mad
cow issue to dominate the summit which is expected to discuss the
fight against unemployment and the mechanism of the single
currency of Euro.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Michel Barnier, French minister-delegate to
foreign ministry in charge of European affairs, told radio
interviewers that the Florence summit would not be able to lift
the ban on British beef exports.

CANBERRA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Australia will continue to

Director of Coal Operations Australia Ltd. Tony Haraldson said at

costs as coal prices today were about 40 percent lower in

MOGADISHU, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Two men kidnapped a small plane
from the K-50 airstrip, 50 kms south of here, to Hilwayne
airstrip, 30 kms north of Mogadishu yesterday.
</P>
<P>
According to an eyewitness at the airstrip, the men were
equipped with a hand grenade and a pistol to hijack the plane
which imported green narcotic leaves of Khat to Mogadishu from
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers have looted 30,000 U.S. Dollars on the plane
and later on released it to proceed its flight to Nairobi without
hurting anybody.
</P>
<P>
The plane was hired by a Khat business dealer known as Mr Ali
Aden from the neighboring country of Kenya. According to people
at K-50, the hijackers pretended to be ordinary business men and
paid for the ticket to Nairobi where the plane was supposed to
go.

Reports said the two men have introduced a map to the pilot
immediately after take-off and trained their weapons on the
pilot, forcing him to fly according to the map, saying otherwise
he'd loose his life.
</P>
<P>
The pilot then landed at Hilwayne airstrip where all
passengers and the pilot were released unhurt after the incident.
</P>
<P>
More than eight small Khat transporting planes hired from
Kenya arrive at K-50 airstrip everyday.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's January-May Trade Deficit Up From 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 21 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's trade deficit during
the first five months this year rose to 7.38 billion U.S. dollars,
15 percent up from the same period of 1995, according to a report
of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry released today.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit in May amounted to 1.35 billion dollars with
11.33 billion dollars in exports, 6.4 percent up from a year
earlier, and 12.68 billion dollars in imports, 7.3 percent up from
a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Exports of semiconductor, which accounted for 19.4 percent of
South Korea's total exports in the first quarter of this year,
fell by 1.3 percent in April and 18 percent in May, mainly due to
a fall in prices worldwide. As a result, their contribution to the
total exports decreased to 12.1 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
Steel and chemical product exports also dropped by 33.4 and
12.1 percent last month respectively, while automobiles and
textiles posted increases of 39.1 percent and 5.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's trade deficit last year stood at 10.06 billion
dollars, up 58.7 percent from the 6.34 billion dollars registered
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Exports increased by 30.3 percent from 1994 to 125.06 billion
dollars in 1995, the fastest yearly growth since 36.2 percent was
recorded in 1987, while imports grew even faster at 32 percent to
135.12 billion dollars, the highest since they shot up 35.8
percent in 1979.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Review Trade Ties With Israel If Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said today it will
review its trade ties with Israel if the new Israeli government
under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu refuses to continue the
peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said here
today at a press gathering that any policy to either improve or
terminate all relations between Malaysia and Israel depends on
future development.
</P>
<P>
However, Abdullah said the decision of the Malaysian government
to allow Malaysian businessmen to have trade relations with Israel
can continue for the time being.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia did not have any relationship with Israel in the past.
Early this year, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
announced that Malaysian private sector would be allowed to have
trade ties with Israel.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Upholds Free Movement in W. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has reiterated its
commitment to the implementation of the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS) protocol on free movement of goods
and persons in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
It is making efforts to reduce the number of check points on
the trans-border highways, said Mrs. t. o. Lijadu Oyemade, head
of the Nigerian delegation to the consultative meeting on the
improvement of traffic on Accra-Lome-Cotonu- Lagos trunk road
holding in Cotonu, Benin yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to allegations that Nigerian customs and security
agents mount check points to extort, harass and delay
transporters on the Accra-Lagos highways, Lijadu said it is
difficult for the authorities to check "private" check points, a
report reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
Lijadu called on economic operators to aid government
authorities to check these nefarious activities of security
agents by promptly reporting the corrupt officials to higher
authorities.
</P>
<P>
"It is a sensitive situation that we are faced with," she
said, and suggested that economic operators should be provided
with special passes to identify them at customs and security
points.
</P>
<P>
The Accra-Lagos highway runs through Ghana, Togo, Benin and
Nigeria. Random checks by the authorities in the four countries
have been identified as a hinderance to the free movement of
goods and people in the ECOWAS community.

<P>
MANILA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The 8th mixed committee of the
Philippine government and Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF)
failed to open peace talks today despite the arrival of MNLF
Chairman Nur Misuari.
</P>
<P>
The talks was supposed to open Wednesday in Davao, the third
largest city in Philippines. But bad weather and other factors
delayed the arrival of some delegates including MNLF Chairman Nur
Misuari.
</P>
<P>
One of the major thorny issues is the integration of Moro
troops into the armed forces of the Philippines (AFP).
</P>
<P>
According to AFP chief of staff Auturo Enrile, the call for the
integration of MNLF's 15,000 military men into the government
forces "will be difficult to accept" for the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the MNLF insisted that the government take in 15,000
of its soldiers despite the statement from AFP that it can only
absorb 5,000.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Gun Laws Cause Controversy in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Australia's uniform national gun
laws ran into hard resistance from gun-owners and pro-gun
politicians despite the federal government's resolve to put
through stricter gun controls.
</P>
<P>
The massacre of 35 people by a lone gunman at Port Arthur,
Tasmania, in April prompted the federal and state governments to
agree on principles of uniform gun laws.
</P>
<P>
The long-due nationwide laws would save Australia from going
down the same road as the United States did, where gun-related
violence was part of daily life, Prime Minister John Howard said.
</P>
<P>
However, criticism emerged immediately after the federal
government and police ministers of the eight states and
territories reached agreement on May 10. Gun owners'
organizations said that Howard made the decision on emotional
rather than rational basis.
</P>
<P>
Federal and state parliamentarians received death threat from
gun supporters. Howard wore a bulletproof vest when he attended a
pro-gun rally in Victoria earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Major gun lobby groups such as the Sporting Shooters
Association of Australia said that stricter gun controls were not
a fair go for law-abiding gun owners. More than 100,000 people
rallied around the country in protest against the new gun laws.
One of their slogan went: "Do not give up your guns."
</P>
<P>
The proposed new gun laws ban all automatic and semi-automatic
guns, stipulate licensing of all firearms and set up a nationwide
registration system of guns.
</P>
<P>
Under the "genuine need" conditions imposed by the laws, over
90 percent of license holders in some parts of Australia would
become ineligible, gun owners claimed.
</P>
<P>
Gun collectors, hobby shooters and farmers are among the most
affected by the new gun laws. Gun owners in rural areas said that
they needed automatic weapons to hunt feral animals and shoot
livestock in drought spells.
</P>
<P>
Howard has said he would not back down an inch on the stance of
implementing stricter gun controls all over the country. But the
federal government and several state governments are facing
pressure from within their own ranks.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister urged the state governments to accelerate
the process of introducing national gun laws in face of mounting
pressure from gun lobbyists. He also implied a possible choice of
a national referendum.
</P>
<P>
"If the Australian people were given the opportunity to express
a view on this matter, it would express it overwhelmingly in favor
of what the government is proposing," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, local analysts said they did not expect any nationwide
gun law to be in place in the near future.

<HEADLINE> New Budget Promotes Investment: Tanzanian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Finance Minister, Prof. Simon Mbilinyi presented the budget to
the National Assembly in Dodoma, central Tanzania on Thursday,
which moved notably to remove taxes frustrating the activities of
investors while not contributing significant funds to government
revenue.
</P>
<P>
He also proposed to cancel the capital gains tax and tax on
dividends on interest by depositors.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister's budget speech, a total of 758
billion Tanzania Shillings (1,223 million US Dollars) was
budgeted for both recurrent and development expenditure, with the
recurrent expenditure portion standing at 631 billion T. Shs.
(1,018 million Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Development expenditure is earmarked at 126.4 billion T. Shs.
(2.4 million Dollars), with some 22 billion T. Shs. (about 35
million Dollars) expected from external sources, alongside loans
and grants projected at 92 billion T. Shs. (about 148 million
Dollars) for the development budget.
</P>
<P>
The recurrent budget portion funds represent an increase of 29
percent as compared to the 1995/96 budget.
</P>
<P>
The development budget registered a decline of 8.5 percent as
compared to the 131 billion T. Shs (about 211 million Dollars)
projected in the out-going budget plan.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the development budget reflects commitments to
pay large outstanding external and domestic debts.
</P>
<P>
Revenue from taxes and non-tax revenue is projected at 550
billion T. Shs. (about 887 million Dollars) this financial year,
with external loans and grants possibly reaching 187 billion T.
Shs. and non-tax revenue from bank borrowing put at 24 billion T.
Shs (about 39 million Dollars), to be obtained mainly through the
auctioning of treasury bills.
</P>
<P>
The budget proposals have put up for implementation a number
of strong recommendations from the business community, the
minister noted, promising that continuous dialogue in a spirit of
partnership should be fostered between the government and the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
Prof Mbilinyi said, of interest to farmers would be measures
toward a price stabilization trust to reduce the cost of farm
inputs, financed by bank loans carrying high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Another noticeable measure is the increase in import duties on
large commercial vehicles to encourage local assembly of motor
vehicles, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Stiff penalties would be stipulated for tax evasion, including
fines and imprisonment, with the defaulters eventually required
to pay the taxes they evaded, he stated.
</P>
<P>
The scrapping of the capital gains tax and the tax on
dividends is likely to spur more foreign and local investors,
especially with the on-going campaign to attract more private
firms to list their shares in the stock exchange whose opening is
scheduled for early September, some economists commended.
</P>
<P>
"If a budget was to be fared on actual requirements it would
reach more than one trillion Shillings," the minister told the
legislators, noting the effort the government had placed toward
the eventual realization of a balance budget.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that this year's budget proposals have place great
emphasis on development of economic and social services and
diminishing the burden carried by low-income groups, whose non-
taxable allowance has been increased, while family and children
allowances have been added for the purposes of computing income
tax.

<HEADLINE> First Day of Registration for Civil Service Exam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The first day of registration for
the upcoming examination for 737 central party and state
positions, saw nearly 10,000 people showing up at the registration
hall here today to ask for details or to sign up for the exam.
</P>
<P>
"Holding public examinations to recruit civil servants is a
major change in our former official selection and promotion
process based merely on recommendations, and should be continued
and spread to a larger scale," said Tomur Dawamat, vice-chairman
of the National People's Congress Standing Committee who visited
the registration at the Beijing Agriculture Exhibition Hall today.
</P>
<P>
"It is also an important part of the reform of our political
structure in our drive toward a socialist market economy," he
commented, upon seeing the many applicants.
</P>
<P>
This is the examination's third year and the number of
applicants has been increasing steadily, and sixty-one government
bodies had booths here to fill the 737 positions.
</P>
<P>
State Councillor Li Guixian asked graduate student Meng Wei why
she wants to become a civil servant.
</P>
<P>
"I study land management and control. Our country needs to
tighten management and controls of land, I expect to make a
contribution to my country with what I have learned," she replied.
</P>
<P>
"The state is in need of specialized talent like yours. I wish
you success," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Ministry of Power Industry said they want
qualified employees without regard to their social status or place
of residence. The ministry plans to recruit employees nationwide,
not just from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"We should enlarge the scope of the selection process," Li
Guixian said, noting that only in that way could the principles of
equality and competition be fully demonstrated.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Water Resources has taken part in the exams for
three years. A ministry official said that employees recruited
this way have proven to be very capable and knowledgeable, and some
have been promoted in one to two years.
</P>
<P>
Many young people applying here see the exams as a chance at
fairer competition. One woman said the central party and
government organizations, as governing bodies, should be an ideal
place for the young to work.
</P>
<P>
"I do not expect a rise in salary, but I expect to learn more
and do more for the country," she said.
</P>
<P>
Many of the applicants turned out to be from companies where
incomes are fairly high. Some want a change in the environment or
for a new job. The security of a government job is also attractive
to many.
</P>
<P>
Because of the crowding in the registration hall, many
applicants were forced to sit on the ground to fill in the
forms. Supervisors chosen by the Ministry of Personnel went to
work here today to look out for cheating during the exams.

<HEADLINE> EU Florence Summit to Focus on Unemployment, Monetary Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FLORENCE, Italy, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The world's attention will
be drawn this weekend to the Italian city of Florence, where heads
of state and government of the 15 members of the European Union
(EU) are gathering to discuss pressing problems of the EU.
</P>
<P>
Amid hopes of a breakthrough in the "mad cow" crisis at the
summit, concerns over Europe's 18 million jobless may return to
the top of the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Two other major topics will be the revision of the Maastricht
Treaty and progress toward Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
The EU's inter-governmental conferences on its future and its
external relations (former Yugoslavia, EU-Mediterranean links, the
Middle East peace process, relations with Russia) will also be on
the crowded agenda.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment is one of the most serious problems in EU.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the European statistics Bureau,
the EU's average unemployment rate in March this year stood at 11
percent, compared to 5.4 percent in the United States and 3.2
percent in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the European Commission Jacques Santer has warned
that unemployment in the EU could threaten social stability if it
is not resolved soon.
</P>
<P>
The summit will discuss the European Commission's "confidence
pact" for jobs, but whether the pact can tackle unemployment
effectively remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
The leaders will also review the progress toward the third
phase of EMU, with reports from the European Monetary Institute on
the "ins and outs" of a single currency and from the Commission on
preparations for the introduction of the new currency, the Euro.
</P>
<P>
Most EU members are having difficulties meeting the five
criteria for eligibility to join the EMU as stipulated in the
Maastricht Treaty.
</P>
<P>
One of the most important requirements is that a country's
budget deficit should not exceed three percent of Gross National
Product (GNP), and its public debt should not exceed 60 percent of
GNP.
</P>
<P>
Only Germany and Luxembourg met this requirement in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Sluggish economic growth has made it is difficult for more EU
countries to approach these standards.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund forecast in April this year
that the EU's average economic growth rate will only reach 1.8
percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The EU is facing the dilemma of whether to change the criteria
or to slow down the process toward the EMU.
</P>
<P>
The "mad cow" row between Britain and its EU partners has also
been a headache which EU officials hope can be resolved in
Florence.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister John Major told the House of Commons on
Thursday that he hoped to secure an agreement on lifting the
EU-imposed ban on British beef exports at the summit.
</P>
<P>
Experts here said that to what extent government leaders can
reach consensus on the problems on the agenda, the largest number
in the summit's history, will depend in large part on the
sincerity of the member states and their confidence in the future
of the EU.

<HEADLINE> Private Economic Sector Grows Fast in Hubei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The growth rate of private economic
sector in central China's Hubei province has surpassed China's
average for three consecutive years, thanks to the provincial
government's support.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the output value, tax, and commodities
retail sales of the private sector grew at 90 percent, 25 percent,
and 50 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the number of people working in the
sector was close to four million, 15 percent of the province's
total working population. And the output value, retail sales and
taxes of the sector accounted for 12 percent, 42 percent and ten
percent of Hubei's total.
</P>
<P>
To promote the private sector, the provincial government has
established a special committee to supervise the development of
private economic sector, according to an official with the
provincial industrial and commercial administration.
</P>
<P>
Tang Desheng, division chief supervising the private sector,
said the provincial authorities have also issued a regulation on
the sector, which aims at protecting the rights of individual
workers and owners of private businesses, and ensuring fair market
competition for all sectors.
</P>
<P>
Tang pointed out that it is critical to the future expansion of
private economic sector in Hubei to achieve an economy that
operates on a large scale.
</P>
<P>
He added Hubei will continue to encourage private businesses to
increase investment, to purchase shares of state-owned
enterprises, and to merge with or lease poorly run medium-sized and
small state-owned enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Chief Economic Adviser Calls for Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Jacob Frenkel, one of Israel's
most authoritative economists, has called on the government to
keep the economy in balance, reported the Jerusalem Post today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the paper, Frenkel said the new
government should focus on the creation of conditions which would
allow sustainable growth, a reduction of inflation to the
low single-digit levels which currently exist among the
industrialized powers, and continued reforms aimed at deregulation,
trade liberalization, and full lifting of all foreign currency
related limitations.
</P>
<P>
Frenkel, governor of the Central Bank of Israel, was appointed
head of the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) at the new
government's first cabinet session Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also announced that Frenkel
will also be a member of the new privatization panel. The other
members are Finance Minister Dan Meridor and Justice Minister
Ya'acov Ne'eman.
</P>
<P>
Frenkel said the government will have to cut the budget in a
way that would narrow the fiscal deficit, while contributing to a
long-term reduction of government intervention.
</P>
<P>
He said that the current 34 percent development aid offered
investors in high priority areas should be cut. Plans currently
offered by the government are "full of deformities," he said, and
need urgent rationalization according to a gradual timetable that
would be fully revealed in advance, and thus avoid business-
unfriendly uncertainties.
</P>
<P>
The Israel's Central Bank governor also called on cabinet
ministers to balance their desires to satisfy particular
constituencies with their duty to serve the national interests.
</P>
<P>
He expressed concern that commitments to its coalition
partners might burden the new government's road to macro-economic
recovery. He said that a strategic decision concerning budget
cuts would need to be taken soon, due to this year's unplanned
fiscal expansion.
</P>
<P>
Frenkel also reiterated his long-standing view that taxes
should not be raised, monetary policy should reflect long-term
anti-inflationary goals, and that the cabinet should declare
long-term, numerically defined macro-economic targets.
</P>
<P>
He said that privatization does not necessarily have to be
done in ways that sound threatening to workers.

<HEADLINE> "Green" Cars Running In Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 21 (Xinhua) -- "Green" taxis, fueled with
liquified natural gas, are cruising the streets of China's largest
city to help clear the air of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
A local taxi company, appropriately called "Green", has
recruited 15 Santana sedan cars with an additional gas-burning
equipment to provide a fleet considered more cleaner for the
environment.
</P>
<P>
The carbon monoxide content in the cars' exhausts will be 90
percent lower than those petrol-driven cars, with hydrocarbon
levels lowered by 50 percent, and they will be dust-free.
</P>
<P>
The local oil-gas administration department has built two
gas-filling stations for the cars, and it just takes 2.5 minutes
to refuel a car, with each station able to refill 190 cars a day.
</P>
<P>
However only 18 Santanas and one truck have been installed with
the equipment, among the 500,000 cars in Shanghai's streets.
</P>
<P>
And for the same distance, the fuel for pollution-free cars
costs more than petrol.

<HEADLINE> China Publishes Defense Reportage Book </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- China has published a book series
about the country's defense technology that includes stories
relating to nuclear and other weapons testing.
</P>
<P>
The books contain stories about China's nuclear testing, rocket
and satellite launches, conventional weapons testing, navigating and
sensing nuclear submarines from space, aero-mechanics and the
training of defense technicians, according to the publisher.
</P>
<P>
Liu Huaqing, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission,
wrote a preface for the book series.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu, who is also a member of the Standing
Committee of the Politburo of the CPC Central Committee, China's
military technology research began weakly and now has evolved into
a strong system. This ensures a stable environment for economic
construction and contributes to world peace, he said.
</P>
<P>
The development of China's defense industry is "a successful
example of how a poor country has done a big job," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
The books were compiled by the Commission of Science,
Technology and Industry for National Defense and published by the
Publishing House of the Party School of the Chinese Communist
Party Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
People from military, culture, press and publishing circles
held a seminar here today to discuss the significance of the
publication.
</P>
<P>
Yesterday, Chinese president Jiang Zemin met with a group of
military personnel who won prizes for their achievements in
developing military technology, and he urged them to modernize the
army.

<HEADLINE> Yantai to Become International Modern Port City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANTAI, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Yantai in east China's Shandong
Province intends to build itself into an international modern port
city during the next two to three decades.
</P>
<P>
One of the first 14 open coastal cities designated by China in
1984, Yantai ranks in second place after Qingdao in the province
last year with its 57.5 billion yuan of gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
Yantai has established trade relationship with more than 80
countries and regions and set up more than 4,300 foreign-funded
projects.
</P>
<P>
The city aims to increase both local total overseas investments
and yearly foreign exchange earnings from exports to more than
four billion US dollars by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
The city also plans to attract many multi-national firms and
consortiums to invest in local high-economic-return projects,
covering automobile, machinery, electronics, textiles, clothing,
pharmaceuticals, chemical, building materials, foodstuffs, gold as
well as deep-processing industries.
</P>
<P>
It will resort to imported technology and overseas investment
to transform traditional industries and improve local pillar
industries, in a bid to set up 100 export-oriented enterprises to
earn annually more than 10 million US dollars in foreign exchange
each.
</P>
<P>
More effort will also be put into speeding up construction of
economic and technological development zones, developing
agriculture and improving local infrastructure construction.

<HEADLINE> Yangtze River Delta Has Potential for Agricultural Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The Yangtze River Delta in east
China now has great potential for agricultural investment with
more than 1,000 foreign-funded agricultural enterprises in
operation.
</P>
<P>
Businesses in the area include those that deep-process farm
products, produce vegetable oil, bean products and fast food,
preserve animal and aquatic products, grow flowers and breed seeds.
</P>
<P>
Some green food, aquatic products, cow's milk and fruit bases
in the area enjoy substantial economic returns from investment.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of profits to costs of agricultural projects in the
delta rose from nearly five percent in 1987 to 60 percent during
the recent two years, higher than that of projects in the sectors
of industry, commerce, construction and transportation.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River Delta, covering the northern part of Zhejiang
Province, the southern part of Jiangsu Province and Shanghai,
China's largest city, is the country's most advanced economic area
and has helped form a huge consumer market.
</P>
<P>
Increased living standards and the country's policy to
gradually lift control on farm products' prices also have helped
farm product prices rise.
</P>
<P>
Over the next five years, China will give priority to
agriculture in national economic development, providing more aid
and giving more preferential policies for agricultural projects to
improve the country's agricultural development.

</P>
<P>
Last year, the Philippines was ranked no. 35.
</P>
<P>
World competitiveness is an indication of political stability,
government efficiency, and globally-acceptable financial and
fiscal policies. It was partly based on a survey answered by 3,162
top executives around the world.
</P>
<P>
the forum also reported that the per capita income of the

<HEADLINE> Carbon Dioxide Emission in Japan Hit Record in Fiscal 1994 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Carbon dioxide emissions in Japan
rose 5.9 percent to a record high in fiscal 1994, according to a
Kyodo News Service report Friday.
</P>
<P>
This has cast doubt on whether Japan can meet its pledge to
keep such emissions at 1990 levels by 2000.
</P>
<P>
In the fiscal year ending March 31, 1995, carbon dioxide
emissions totaled the equivalent of 343 million tons of carbon, a
figure well above the 320 million tons in fiscal 1990, the
Environment Agency report showed.
</P>
<P>
The previous record high was set in fiscal 1992 when carbon
dioxide emissions totaled the equivalent of 330 million tons of
carbon. Such emissions showed the first drop in fiscal 1993, to
324 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Agency officials attributed the fiscal 1994 rise chiefly to
greater electric power demand induced by an unusually hot summer
and increased use of electrical office equipment.
</P>
<P>
Carbon dioxide is one of the main "greenhouse gases" and
industrial nations are required to keep such emissions at 1990
levels under the 1992 Framework Convention on Climate Change, a
U.N. treaty aimed at preventing global warming by limiting
greenhouse gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
Japan will host a third meeting of signatory nations to the
U.N. treaty next year, at which goals for reductions of
greenhouse gas emissions after the turn of the century will be
set, said the report.

<HEADLINE> Exploration and Development of Tarim Worthwhile, Oil Official Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Oil exploration and development in
in the Tarim Basin in northwest China is more successful than in
the older oilfields in the east.
</P>
<P>
Liang Digang, vice-president of the Tarim Petroleum Exploration
and Development Bureau, said the 560,000-square-kilometer basin is
more economically efficient since China began large-scale
development there in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Liang said exploration and development of the basin, most of
which is covered by desert, has high economic returns. Reserves in
each wildcat well in Tarim are 2.09 million tons on average, three
times the figure recorded in the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
Forming a production capacity of one million tons of crude oil
demands an average investment of 1.934 billion yuan (about 233
million US dollars), while in Tarim, 1.79 billion yuan (about 216
million US dollars) are needed.
</P>
<P>
Per capita labor productivity in Tarim ranks first among all
oilfields in the country, with each person producing an added
value of 494,200 yuan (about 5,900 US dollars) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Liang stressed that the "huge advantage" of Tarim is its high
yield, with each oil well there producing more than 100 tons a
day. In the Tazhong-4 Oilfield of the basin, five horizontal wells
produced 600 tons a day, and the basin has the country's sole well
capable of producing more than 1,000 tons a day.
</P>
<P>
Although the 600-million-year-old basin has complex geological
conditions for exploration and needs large investment in
infrastructure facilities, its exploration and development has
been rewarding, Liang said.
</P>
<P>
"Tarim's economy is in a virtuous cycle with more and more
money being raised from sales of crude oil," he said.
</P>
<P>
Liang also said that unlike most of the oilfields that must
provide a lifetime job for thousands of oil workers and their
families, oilfields in the Tarim Basin have more than 4,000
workers who are employed by a contract system.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president said that Tarim's annual production capacity
will reach five million tons next year, which will greatly aid the
stabilization of China's onshore oil output.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Police Crush Biggest Russian Crime Ring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Police have smashed a
Russian mafia, arresting 28 people suspected of crimes including
forgery, drug trade and murders, the Jerusalem Post reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Police described this as the biggest crime ring involving
Russians uncovered in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Yossi Levy, head of police investigations, said most of the
detained were connected to an international crime ring based in
Russia that also operates in several European countries.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted as saying that Israeli police launched the
crackdown with the help of their counterparts in several European
states.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first criminal ring connected to international
crime in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) that has
been uncovered here," Levy said.
</P>
<P>
The police preferred the term "international crime" to "mafia,"
because the latter implies criminal activity that has penetrated
the ruling establishment -- which is not the case in Israel, but
is allegedly the case in the CIS.
</P>
<P>
The gang was suspected of engaging in bribery, fraud, and
forgery, mainly connected to the distribution of illegal
documents ranging from credit cards to Israel army's discharge
sheets, the report said.
</P>
<P>
They were also reported to be involved in many cases of
murders, drug trade and prostitution.
</P>
<P>
Police said that the gang arranged fictitious marriages with
Israeli women, mainly immigrants from the CIS, for CIS men who
wanted to gain Israeli citizenship, often for criminal
purposes. The immigrant women were paid some 2,000 U.S. dollars to
go abroad to marry the men.
</P>
<P>
Russian criminals regard Israel as a prime location for
laundering money, and the Israeli citizenship make it easier for
them to operate, police said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Interior Ministry, Military Police and Income Tax
and Customs authorities are now increasing their cooperation in
helping the investigation and preventing future crimes.

<HEADLINE> Hometowns of Overseas Chinese Improve Life on Their Own </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Oversea Chinese used to make
donations to their hometowns or give money to their relatives in
Hainan Province, China's biggest special economic zone in southern
China. Now the trend has changed as more and more of them turn to
the conducting of investment there.
</P>
<P>
Overseas Chinese have set up more than 6,000 enterprises in
Hainan, with the total investment topping 2.7 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
And people in the hometowns of the overseas Chinese in the
province work hard by themselves in order to live a better life.
</P>
<P>
"I lived on the money sent back by our brothers and sisters
living abroad before 1985," said Fu Gongwei, director of the
Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of Jiaji Township, Qionghai City.
</P>
<P>
"I began to pursue a kind of self-reliant lifestyle until I was
in my 30s," said Fu, "and today in Hainan, people who spend money
earned by themselves are the most respected."
</P>
<P>
In Longgun Township, another renowned hometown of overseas
Chinese, there is a street lined with deluxe residences, one-third
of which are built by locals who have made a fortune in recent
years.

WASHINGTON, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Olympic flame arrived in
Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States, Thursday
afternoon on the 54th day of its journey to Atlanta for the
Olympic Games on July 19-August 4.
</P>
<P>
Starting from Baltimore Thursday morning, the torch relay
entered the District of Columbia just before 3:00 p.m. EDT and
immediately began the 7-hour city trek amidst celebrations at
major places.
</P>
<P>
Watched and greated by thousands of people along the sides of
the route, the torch, was carried by some 80 high school students,
senior citizens and former Olympians, of whom more than half are
"community heroes", along the route from East Capital Street
through the D.C. and Arlington County to the White House, the
destination of the day.
</P>
<P>
It also passed through many major places in the city with
celebrations at the Capitol Hill, the Howard University, the
Washington National Cathedral and the Arlington National Cemetery.

At the Capitol Hill, House Speaker Newt Gingrich said "Each of
us, as we watch the flame and watch the runners, will draw a
little bit of that spirit of peaceful competition."
</P>
<P>
AT 10:00 p.m., the torch arrived at the White House, where
President Bill Clinton accepted the torch. Clinton and
torchbearer I. King Jordan, the president of Galluadet University,

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Spain Attaches Importance to Relations With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Calling itself a bridge connecting
the western industrialized countries and the third world
countries, Spain has often attached much importance to its
economic relations with them, and has achieved great successes in
its efforts.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, King Juan Carlos I has more than once issued
decrees to set up various special organizations and foundations
that aim at the promotion of Spain's trade with, and investment
in, the countries in Latin America, Asia and Africa.
</P>
<P>
Economic and trade exchanges between Spain and Latin America,
the second largest partner, have been continuously developing.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Spain's imports from Latin America increased 14
percent over that of the previous year. Only in the first quarter
of this year, its imports from that area once again increased by
7.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
During Spain's presidency of the European Union (EU) in the
second half of 1995, it worked hard to promote cooperation between
the EU and the South American Common Market (MERCOSUR) member
nations including Brazil and Argentina, the two biggest countries
in South America.
</P>
<P>
Spain's economic and trade relations with the Asian countries
have also been prominently improved, with its imports from Asia
increasing by 11.9 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Among the Asian nations, China ranked Spain's 25th trading
partner in 1992, and has now moved up to the 10th position as
Spain's import source and 14th of its export market.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Chinese Customs disclosed that total trade
between the two countries reached 1.65 billion U.S. dollars in
1994, a 63.8 percent increase over 1993. Last year, the volume
rose again to 1.89 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between Spain and the Magreb countries of Tunis,
Algeria and Morocco and the Mid-East witnessed very fast
improvement. Last year, its sales to the Mid-East rose by 14
percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
With a gradual economic recovery, Spain encourages overseas
investments. According to official statisitcs, in 1993, its
investment in Latin America alone totaled 67.1 billion peseta
(about 524 million U.S. dollars) and in 1994 the figure climbed to
453.7 billion peseta (3.7 billion dollars). In Africa, Spanish
investment last year was five times more than in 1993 while that
in Asia, except Japan, shot up to 400 million peseta (3.12 million
dollars) in 1994 from zero in 1993. This year, its Asian
investment is expected to grow to 5.4 billion peseta (42.2 million
dollars), 13 times that of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Besides economic exchanges, Spain has also broadened and
deepened mutual understanding with the third world countries by
means of investigating markets, displaying exhibitions, and
government-sponsored business visits.
</P>
<P>
Realizing that economic and trade relations should be
supplemented and supported by diplomatic activities, the Spanish
governmental departments play an active role in helping private
medium- and small-sized firms to find their ways to the markets in
the third world.
</P>
<P>
It has established foundations and credits, with an approved
funding amounting to 800 billion peseta in 1995, to benefit the
third world countries in their purchasing of Spanish electric,
communication, food processing equipments.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it has launched a governmental development
assistance fund to help the third world countries, that increased
from 64 billion (500 million dollars) peseta in 1989 to 177.4
billion peseta (1.3 billion dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish government has at the same time promised that it
will enhance assistance to the third world though it restricts its
own public expenditure so as to meet the condition set by the
United Nations that its foreign assistance account for no more
than 0.7 percent of its domestic gross product.
</P>
<P>
Just as Prime minister Jose Aznar, who came to power at the
beginning of May this year, has promised, Spain will continue to
attach importance to its relations with the thrid world.

<HEADLINE> China Takes Seriously Side-effects of Auto Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The rapid development of the auto
industry has become a driving force in China's economy, but it has
also created car accidents, an energy shortage and environmental
pollution. These problems have elicited widespread concern from
Chinese officials.
</P>
<P>
A report published by the China Automotive Technology and
Research Center says that the auto industry plays a positive role
in attracting overseas investment, promoting the overall level of
the manufacturing industry, and improving people's living
standards.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, China produced 1.45 million motor vehicles, ranking it
11th in the world; and 7.83 million motorcycles, ranking it first.
</P>
<P>
So far, the country has 10.5 million automobiles, 18 million
motorcycles and nearly 10 million other vehicles.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, China will have 18-21 million vehicles, and
in 2010, 44-50 million.
</P>
<P>
With the rapid increase of motor vehicles in use, reports of
car accidents in China have sharply risen in recent years, the
report says.
</P>
<P>
The death toll from car accidents reached 272,000 in 1995; in
1994 the fatalities numbered 71,000. The average death rate per
10,000 vehicles was 24.3 in 1994, several times higher than in
developed nations.
</P>
<P>
There are 600 million vehicles in the world, which have become
a major source of environmental pollution, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Exhaust pollutants in China-produced motor vehicles are not the
main sources of air pollution. In some large Chinese cities,
vehicle counts are still less than those in developed nations, but
this does not mean that pollution caused by motor vehicles can be
ignored, the report says.
</P>
<P>
Dangerous emissions from most homemade and designed automobiles
in the early 1990s is 1-6 times higher than those in developed
countries, the report shows.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 46 percent of the world's oil products are consumed by
automobiles. By the year 2000, the national demand of oil will be
about 200 million tons, but the domestic output will only meet 80
percent of the demand.
</P>
<P>
The report suggests that development of a popular new auto
series is imperative if it is to claim a significant share of
China's auto market.
</P>
<P>
New cars must meet following standards: the maximum speed limit
is 140 km, oil consumption is four liters per 100 km, and car
prices are around 80,000 yuan (about 9,600 US dollars), the report
says.

<HEADLINE> APEC Trade May Be Liberalized Earlier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Trade liberalization in the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) region may be accelerated
to an earlier date from the agreed 2020 timetable, but this would
be on a sectorial basis.
</P>
<P>
Antonio Basilio, deputy chairman of the APEC senior officials
meeting, said today that at least five sectors are expected to be
opened up ahead of time. These sectors are information technology,
wood products, base chemicals, marine products and toys.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the 18 APEC members have a varying degree of
liberalization programs.
</P>
<P>
In their individual action plans submitted to a senior
officials meeting in Cebu, some members indicated they intend to
bind tariff rates by as much as 50 percent lower than their
commitment to the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The five sectors were actually taken up at WTO but did not move
for lack of support. Basilio said this APEC move may trigger a WTO
action on these sectors.

<HEADLINE> Four DYP Deputies Resign in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Four deputies of the True Path
Party (DYP) led by former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller have
resigned because of opposition to Ciller's intention to obey the
demand of the pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP) for the formation of
a new government.
</P>
<P>
State Minister Ibrahim Yasar Dedelek, Sinasi Atiner, Tevfik
Diker and Irfan Demiralp, members of the DYP executive committee,
made their resignations late Thursday night and are expected to
join the Motherland Party (ANAP) led by caretaker Prime Minister
Mesut Yilmaz today.
</P>
<P>
The number of the DYP deputies in the parliament descended to
128 and the DYP, now the second largest party in the parliament,
is expected to become the third parliamentary party when the four
deputies join the ANAP this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In a week, six DYP deputies have resigned from the party in a
bid to oppose Ciller's political policy.
</P>
<P>
Ciller had repeatedly said she would not join a coalition
government with the RP after the last December's general elections
as the RP becomes the first party in the parliament. But after the
ANAP-DYP coalition government resigned on June 6, Ciller changed
her mind and intended to cooperate with the RP for the formation
of a coalition government.

<HEADLINE> Revenue Collection to Be Tightened in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The government decision to
broaden its tax base and adjust various taxes aims to tighten
revenue collection and discourage tax evasions.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Finance Prof. Simon Mbilinyi told the national
assembly on Thursday that tax exemptions would also be reviewed
and the Tanzania Revenue Authority which comes into force next
month, would be the only agency that would advise the minister of
finance on tax exemptions.
</P>
<P>
According to local press today, while proposing his maiden
budget to the first budget session in Dodoma, central Tanzania,
the minister said the government during this financial year,
would totally refrain from borrowing from banks and strive
instead to enhance domestic revenue collection and observe
stringent expenditure controls and management.
</P>
<P>
"The main objective is to disentangle from bank borrowing and
from dependence on foreign assistance for financing recurrent
expenditure," said Prof. Mbilinyi.
</P>
<P>
He said severe disciplinary action would be taken against
accounting officers failing to abide by spending orders and
regulations.
</P>
<P>
He said as part of government's spending control measures,
five more sub-treasuries would be established this year bringing
their total to 10.
</P>
<P>
"The subtreasuries have generally been very useful in terms of
expenditure control and management," the minister observed.
</P>
<P>
He said a central payments system would also be established in
Dar Es Salaam and payments of five large ministries would be made
through it.
</P>
<P>
These include the ministry of education, the civil service
department, the ministry of justice and the planning commission.
</P>
<P>
On privatization and divestiture, the minister said in order
to involve the public sector in owning shares in privatized
parastatals, "unit trusts" would be created to enable small
investors to buy shares.
</P>
<P>
On salaries, the minister told the house that minimum
government wage would now be 30,000 Tanzania Shillings (48 U.S.
Dollars) per month instead of 17,500 T. Shs. (28 US Dollars). He
said in line with the pay reform, the pension scheme would also
be reviewed with the objective of improving its administration.

<HEADLINE> China's Sugar Output and Export Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Statistics show that China
produced 6.23 million tons of sugar during the country's 1995-1996
sugar-pressing season that ended last month.
</P>
<P>
The figure is 15 percent more than last year, with sugar made
from sugar cane reaching almost five million tons, according to
China Light Industry News.
</P>
<P>
The growth in the domestic sugar market also slashed the
country's sugar imports to 230,000 tons in the first four months
of this year, down 67 percent from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile China's sugar exports increased by 400 percent to
272,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The increase in sugar output lies in that China has
successfully controlled the inflation rate, with the price of
consumer goods declining, local analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Primary statistics also show that China's seeded area of sugar
plants reached 1.55 million ha this year, roughly the same as last
year's figure.

<HEADLINE> City Watchdog SIB Launches Review of LME </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Security and Investment Board
(SIB), the chief City regulator, has launched a full- scale review
of the London Metal Exchange (LME) following last week's
revelation of the Japanese company Sumitomo's loss of 1.8 billion
US dollars in unauthorised copper trading.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports say today that the review, which comes at
the request of LME chairman Raj Bagri, was launched Wednesday in a
bid to restore international confidence in the market in the wake
of the Sumitomo copper affair.
</P>
<P>
The LME has faced accusations of lax supervision since
Sumitomo's announcement of huge losses because of unauthorised
dealings by Yasuo Hamanaka, its former chief copper trader.
</P>
<P>
The SIB said that the review would be led by David Pritchard,
51, head of the SIB's markets and exchanges division, and would
examine the position of British brokers involved with Hamanaka.
</P>
<P>
The review, scheduled to take six months, will encompass all
the metals traded on the metal exchange, tin, lead, zinc, nickel,
aluminium, but attention will focus on copper.
</P>
<P>
It will also cover derivative trading, on and off
exchange. Over-the-counter, or off-exchange trading, has
traditionally fallen outside the metal exchange's remit.
</P>
<P>
The review will study not only the LME's own rules and
operations but also the arrangements for international cooperation
between regulators.
</P>
<P>
The SIB said it was working closely with the US Commodity
Futures Trading Commission and with Japanese regulators.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Sumitomo had agreed to cooperate with the
SIB inquiries.

</P>
<P>
The old explosives were unearthed in a courtyard in Fugou
County, Henan Province, on June 15, according to the People's
Liberation Army Daily. The ammunitions, which have been buried
for about 50 years, are filled with a high-powered TNT explosive,
and their detonation equipment remains intact, technicians said.
</P>
<P>
It took four hours to detonate the bombs.
</P>
<P>
According to historical records and the memories of some local
elderly residents, the site where the bombs were unearthed is the
former county seat of the Kuomintang regime. The bombs were left
there by Kuomintang troops when they fled the area.

<HEADLINE> Growing Japanese Investment for Tianjin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The largest port city in north
China has witnessed a decrease in the flow of some foreign
investment so far this year, however that of Japanese businessmen
is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
Japan's direct investment into Tianjin totals more than 700
million U.S. dollars, accounting for about four percent of its
total in China and ranking it second after the United States.
</P>
<P>
Japanese-funded enterprises now employ more than 150,000
Chinese workers in China.
</P>
<P>
Japan's companies and business people mainly poured their
investment into the electronics, fibre and machinery industries.
</P>
<P>
The Tianjin municipal government hopes to cooperate with
Japanese investors in the field of oceanic industry in the future.
</P>
<P>
Though the Japanese investment scale in Tianjin is not large --
less than one million U.S. dollars for most projects, the
number of Japanese-funded enterprises is increasing gradually.
</P>
<P>
The total of Japanese-funded projects in 1995 was three times
that reported in 1994, and six times that in 1993.
</P>
<P>
There are 22 Japanese-funded enterprises in Tianjin with
investment surpassing ten million US dollars, making up more than
half of Japan's total investment for the city.

<HEADLINE> Government to Protect Local Industries: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Finance Minister Prof.
Simon Mbilinyi has unveiled the government's 1996/97 budget, in
which several taxes have been reviewed and tax on traditional
exports reintroduced.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the budget proposals at the national assembly in
Dodoma, central Tanzania on Thursday evening, Mbilinyi said the
thrust behind the 1996/97 fiscal measures is to broaden the tax
base and protect local industries in the wake of stiff
competition posed by cheap imports.
</P>
<P>
The government measures are likely to push up prices of many
imported consumer goods, including beer, spirits, tyres and
tubes, textiles and completely built motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The minister said excise duty on local made beer would remain
280 Tanzania Shillings (at present 620 T. Shs. equal to one U.S.
Dollar) a litre, according to local press today.
</P>
<P>
Tax on imported beer from the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) countries would be 345 T. Shs. a litre,
instead of 310 T. Shs a litre.
</P>
<P>
Tax on beer from non-COMESA members has been adjusted from 25
percent of its value to a specific rate of 745 T. Shs. a litre.
The minister said tax review on beer is expected to bring in 784
million T. Shs. revenuei.
</P>
<P>
He said excise duty on local and imported soft drinks is going
up from 32 T. Shs to 34 T. Shs a litre, while excise duty on
local made Konyagi goes up for 300 to 400 T. Shs. a litre, as
that of imported spirits from 300 to 500 T. Shs. a litre.
</P>
<P>
To protect the domestic textile industry, the minister said,
the government is increasing taxes on imported woven fabrics and
garments. He said the rates would be 271 T. Shs. per square meter
or 30 percent, whichever is higher.
</P>
<P>
He said rates for garments would range between 400 to 2,000 T.
Shs. a piece.
</P>
<P>
The minister said tax rate on cigarettes will increase by 20
percent, adding that stamp duty rates are now being adjusted to
20 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said the minimum taxable income is being adjusted from
17,500 T. Shs. to 20,000, a measure intended to give relief to
employees in the low income bracket.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that tax on registration and transfer on
motor vehicles has been raised by 20 percent. Charges would now
be 90,000 T. Shs. for motor vehicles, instead of 75,000 and
27,000 for motor bikes.
</P>
<P>
He said customs duty on packaging materials would be 10
percent and sales tax 10 percent, instead the present 40 and 30
percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The government is now abolishing customs duty and sales tax on
newsprint used for printing newspapers, books and exercise books
for educational purposes, he said, adding that the move is aimed
at enhancing education for the masses in the country.
</P>
<P>
Customs duty on completely built buses and lorries are going
up from 20 to 30 percent, while the same tax for bicycles is
being increased from five to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said sales tax on computers and accessories is being
reduced from 30 to 10 percent, a move which the minister said is
aimed at boosting information technology in the country.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that fee on licences issued by several ministries
would be increased, saying relevant ministries would announce the
new rates later.
</P>
<P>
prof. Mbilinyi said the government was reintroducing tax on
traditional exports, including minerals. the tax would be two
percent of the value of goods lined up for sale abroad.

<HEADLINE> New Accounting Method to Be Introduced for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 21 (Xinhua) -- A new accounting method based on
market value will be introduced in Japan for nonfinancial
businesses as early as 1999 for calculating financial assets,
Kyodo News Service quoted a paper as reporting Friday.
</P>
<P>
The new method, planned by the Ministry of Finance, is aimed
primarily at facilitating supply of corporate information, in
order to protect investors, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun newspaper was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has already decided to have banks and securities
companies record such assets as stocks, bonds and derivatives at
current values rather than at their acquisition costs, starting
from spring 1998.
</P>
<P>
At present, Japanese corporations calculate their securities
holdings under a cost method which makes it difficult for
investors to accurately grasp the financial state of businesses
because their latent losses remain folded as long as they do not
settle their accounts.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, the market-value method forces firms to
disclose earnings or losses at the end of each accounting term,
thereby giving more transparency to their current balance sheets,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry plans to hold next month an extraordinary
meeting of a subcommittee of the Business Accounting Council, an
advisory body to the finance minister, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, the ministry may start work on revising the
Commercial Code and other relevant laws to introduce the
market-value method, the daily said.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Carries Article to Laud Deng Xiaoping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The "People's Daily" today carried
a lengthy front-page article lauding Deng Xiaoping as the man who
created contemporary Marxism.
</P>
<P>
The article, entitled "The Great Invention," recalled Deng's
practices and theories, which have been proved vital to the rise
of China in the 1980s and 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Deng introduced the idea of "Emancipating the minds and seeking
truth from the facts." The concept was very important, according
to the article, as it subsequently triggered many reforms.
</P>
<P>
The first reform was the introduction of the "responsibility
system" in rural areas, which encouraged farmers to produce more
grain. The amount now produced is basically enough to feed 1.2
billion people, according to the article.
</P>
<P>
And it was Deng who answered the question of how to build
socialism, said the article, written by three staff reporters of
the official paper of the Chinese Communist Party Central
Committee.
</P>
<P>
In addition to rural reform, Deng later turned some small
southern towns into economically-prosperous cities, including
Shenzhen. Known as "Special Economic Zones," they are to be seen
as windows of reform and opening.
</P>
<P>
The man also asked officials to crack down on crime, use law to
regulate the society, and improve people's spiritual lives.
</P>
<P>
Another great invention by Deng was the idea of "One Country,
Two Systems," which now serves as a basic stance for dealings
regarding the relations between Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao, and
the reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
All of Deng's philosophies have been fruitful, the article
noted, the first in a series to mark the 75th anniversary of the
founding of the Party.
</P>
<P>
Despite setbacks in the world communist movement, China, as a
socialist country, still stands firmly in the east and continues
to grow, said the article.
</P>
<P>
"Deng's thoughts will continue to be enriched and developed,"
the article concluded.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Cleans up Unreasonable Names of Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The name board of six enterprises
in Beijing have been removed in an ongoing inspection launched by
the municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce, owing to
the unreasonable wording of their names.
</P>
<P>
After examining 23,000 enterprises in 263 avenues, 34
commercial districts, as well as 27 scenic spots of the city, the
municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce found that the
names of 1,032 inspected enterprises were considered unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
Some of those names embodied feudalism and colonialism, others
used names of foreign countries, cities, or enterprises in their
own names, in a bid to take advantage of the latter's reputations.
</P>
<P>
So far 128 enterprises have been fined and 116 others have been
warned or given a limited time to change their names.

organizations flourish throughout the province.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the number of healthcare organizations in
the province has increased to 146 from 60 in the 1950s. All of the
province's prefectures and counties have established medical care
stations for women and children.
</P>
<P>
Departments of gynecology, obstetrics and pediatrics have been
formed in 106 hospitals above county level. More than 99 percent
of township hospitals have special maternity rooms for delivery.
</P>
<P>
The province now has 7,100 professionals who specialize in
gynecology, obstetrics and pediatrics in various medical hospitals

children at county and township levels in the 1980s. Services for
pregnant women and children under the age of six also started at
that time.
</P>
<P>
Regular examinations for prolapsed uterus and urethrovaginal
fistula were performed on more than 100,000 rural women each year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that between 1978 and 1990, 72,000 women who
had these conditions were diagnosed, and 68,000 were cured.
</P>

Compared to the 1950s, the mortality rate of pregnant women and
those in labor dropped from 1,500 per hundred thousand to 149 per
hundred thousand. The death rate for babies decreased from 320 per
thousand to 56 per thousand.
</P>
<P>
Now, medical care services have treated 48 percent of the women
and 25 percent of children under six in the province.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan also is working with overseas and international
organizations to train medical care workers in an effort to
improve medical service standards in remote areas inhabited by
ethnic minority people.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 21 (Xinhua) -- China's largest city has
developed the country's first electronic identity cards, and now
more than half of the enterprises and institutions in Shanghai use
them.
</P>
<P>
Half of Shanghai's 300,000 businesses have the new magnetic
"Intelligence Card," which is about the size of a resident's
identity card.
</P>
<P>
The card stores all the unit's basic information, including its
name, what type of enterprise or institution it is, its address,
the name of its legal representative and its registered capital,
which can be checked at any time by banks and departments of
taxation or statistics.
</P>
<P>
The widespread use of the IC card is due to a new comprehensive
and standardized code system that involves all the businesses and
institutions in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Now, in a few seconds, banks and government departments can
acquire detailed information about an IC-holding unit from the
local computer network.
</P>
<P>
This March, the IC card management system of Shanghai passed
its appraisal by the State Bureau of Technical Supervision, which
believed this system to be in line with the advanced standards of
IC application throughout the world.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Repatriate More Vietnamese Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
today that it will repatriate at least 111 Vietnamese refugees
next Tuesday under the voluntary repatriation program of the UN
High Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release, Defense Secretary Renato de Villa
said that the Vietnamese refugees are scheduled for voluntary
repatriation through Vietnamese Airlines on June 25.
</P>
<P>
He said the number is expected to increase as the Puerto First
Asylum Camp in the southwestern Philippines, where the Vietnamese
refugees are staying, will be closed soon.
</P>
<P>
Villa said that of the 2,104 Vietnamese asylum seekers now in
the Philippines, only 1,477 were cleared by the Vietnamese
government.
</P>
<P>
Over 830 Vietnamese refugees are missing, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government repatriated 202 Vietnamese refugees
on June 11.

<HEADLINE> Miracle Tunnels Dug under Reservoir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese workers have for the
first time dug two highway tunnels under a reservoir.
</P>
<P>
The tunnels, on the Ningbo-Taizhou-Wenzhou super highway in
east China's Zhejiang Province, must pass through a section of the
Huangtuling Mountain where there is a reservoir.
</P>
<P>
The project was first thought too difficult. The idea of
destroying the reservoir to make room for the digging was
rejected, as the reservoir is an irrigation source for hundreds of
hectares of surrounding fertile farmland.
</P>
<P>
By pooling the wisdom of experts from across the country, an
innovative plan was designed that enabled an engineering team,
based in Liaoning Province, to successfully dig the 200-meter-long
and 190-meter-long tunnels under the reservoir.
</P>
<P>
The task took three months of arduous work.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Yeltsin Revamps Inner Circle for Run-off Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 21 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin sacked
several key figures in his entourage in the space of three days in
a bid to woo losers in the June 16 presidential poll and to unite
his team for the July 3 runoff round.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who will stand against communist leader Gennady
Zyuganov on July 3, today fired First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg
Soskovets, Federal Security Service chief Mikhail Barsukov and
top bodyguard Alexander Korzhakov. On Tuesday, he dismissed
Defence Minister Pavel Grachev.
</P>
<P>
The shake-up drew quick praise from liberal economist Grigory
Yavlinsky, who finished fourth in the first round of the election
and whose endorsement has been sought desperately by Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Yavlinsky had conditioned his support on the firing of the
four. But he said he would wait for Yeltsin's next step before
deciding whether to throw his weight behind the president.
</P>
<P>
However, after Grachev's dismissal, he hinted at possible
backing for Yeltsin when, in a television phone-in program
Tuesday, he called on his supporters to vote against Zyuganov and
not to vote against both.
</P>
<P>
Grachev's dismissal was the direct result of the promotion of
his old foe, retired general Alexander Lebed, a black horse in the
first round of the polls. Yeltsin appointed Lebed the new head of
the powerful Security Council and his national security assistant.
</P>
<P>
Lebed came in a strong third in Sunday's polls with nearly 15
percent of the vote, behind Zyuganov's 32 percent and Yeltsin's 35
percent.
</P>
<P>
But it was unclear whether Lebed had a direct role in today's
dismissals.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Lebed said that the decision to shake up
the presidential team was taken by Yeltsin himself.
</P>
<P>
But he said that there had been an attempt to put the president
under pressure by means of force, suggesting that there was a
possible power struggle within Yeltsin's immediate circle, as
alleged by Zyuganov shortly after the dismissals were announced.
</P>
<P>
Lebed was partly referring to the arrests Wednesday night of
two of Yeltsin's leading campaigners on the orders of Korzhakov
and Barsukov for allegedly taking out a large amount of hard
currency from a government building.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's campaign chief Anatoly Chubais, former first deputy
prime minister and advocate of radical reform, seemed to confirm
the suggestion of a power struggle, calling the four sacked
officials "hard-liners" used to resolving issues by force.
</P>
<P>
He said the personnel changes signaled an end to the
"tug-of-war" between the "democratic" and "hard-line" wings in the
presidential team.
</P>
<P>
Chubais said that the "resolute" decision by Yeltsin to fire
the four demonstrated his unique political potential. The
presidential elections will be won by "a new Yeltsin with a new,
renewed team," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency said that the reshuffle defused a
"bomb" planted under Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin as
Barsukov and Korzhakov had wanted Soskovets, their "godfather," to
replace him.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe the "tug-of-war" within the president's
inner circle has been going on from the outset of the election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Itar-Tass said another reason for Korzhakov's ouster was his
constant interference in political and personnel
decisions. Yeltsin had told him "not to meddle in politics" after
the bodyguard said publicly that the elections should be
postponed, causing a furore in the Zyuganov camp and concern in
Western capitals.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Sergei Medvedev said Yeltsin made the
decision to remove the four men after thoroughly analyzing the
situation and holding talks with Chernomyrdin, Chubais and Lebed.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, the president came to the conclusion that it was
time to renew the team in order to avoid false rumors, " he said.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Residents Nourished on Ginseng in Four Seasons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Residents in Shanghai are taking
better care of themselves all year long by exercising and taking
ginseng, the traditional Chinese tonic.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 270 tons of ginseng were sold in the
largest city of China last year to help mainly middle-aged people,
along with the elderly, maintain their health and energy.
</P>
<P>
Most of the urban families have various kinds of ginseng
products, and people eat ginseng throughout the four seasons
instead of just during winter, which is said to be the best time
for taking tonic.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government has tightened the control of the
ginseng market and curbed the inflow of low-quality ginseng to the
city's 600 drugstores.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in suburban Shanghai, who have become prosperous in
recent years, enjoy all kinds of exercise, especially traditional
Chinese exercises such as the Yuanji Dance.
</P>
<P>
The investment in health products has claimed a bigger share in
the farmers' consumption volume, which has doubled its figure from
five years ago.

<HEADLINE> Nanjing's Displaced Workers Recruited as Security Guards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- About 2,000 displaced workers in
Nanjing have been recruited as security guards for state
departments, large recreational centers and shops since the
beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Some of them also oversee the registration and administration
of the floating population in the city, located in east China's
Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Wu Dabao, Deputy Director of the Nanjing Public Security
Bureau, said the recruiting of displaced workers was initiated
both to strengthen the city's grass-root forces for maintaining
public order and to help those who have been laid-off earn an
income.
</P>
<P>
"It is not enough to depend only on the police to crack down on
criminal activities," the police official said.
</P>
<P>
With an increasing floating population and the opening of more
shops and recreational centers, Nanjing is in short supply of
police.
</P>
<P>
According to another official of the Nanjing Public Security
Bureau, each policeman in charge of household registration
oversees affairs in areas with about 2,000 households.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, Nanjing Public Security
Bureau established special departments for the administration of
floating population, and the bureau employed a number of displaced
workers to help policemen in charge of household registration.
</P>
<P>
The ages of those recruited range from 18 to 40 and their
employment term is usually one year. They begin their new work
shortly after training.
</P>
<P>
With the reinforcement of the public security maintenance
forces, criminal cases in the city were down 10.78 percent in the
first three months this year over the same period last year, and
the re-employed workers have helped police capture hundreds of
suspects.

<HEADLINE> Italy's Prime Minister Urges EU to Move On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 20 (Xinhua) -- On the eve of the European Union (EU)
summit in Florence, Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi has urged
the EU to move on despite the many differences among its members.
</P>
<P>
The European Union must move ahead, it simply cannot come to a
halt, the new prime minister told the Florence-based European
University Institute today.
</P>
<P>
He said differences over European Monetary Union (EMU) should
not drag the EU to a standstill as certain EU members could join
the single currency later than others.
</P>
<P>
The European train cannot move at the slowest speed, he added.
</P>
<P>
The EU is targeting to launch a single European currency, the
Euro, by January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
But scepticism is growing over whether the deadline can be met
as few members have been able to fulfill the EMU criteria due to
their sluggish economy.
</P>
<P>
Under the Maastricht Treaty, the budget deficit and national
debt of a member country must not exceed 3 and 60 percent
respectively of its GDP in order to join the EMU.
</P>
<P>
In his remarks, Prodi played down the mad cow crisis, which is
expected to be one of the dominant topics at the Florence summit,
saying that "the worst has passed" in the row over the EU-imposed
ban on British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
Britain's posture of "non-cooperation" with the EU until the
ban is lifted is worrisome but does not represent overall British
policy and London will contribute to the construction of the EU,
Prodi said.
</P>
<P>
But he added that it was necessary to bring Britain back on the
track of cooperation with the EU.
</P>
<P>
The EU Commission imposed a worldwide ban on the export of
British beef and cattle by-products in March after links were
suspected between mad cow disease and its fatal human equivalent,
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease.
</P>
<P>
On the question of the lira, Prodi said the Italian currency
must aim for re-entry into Europe's Exchange Rate Mechanism, which
Italy quit in September 1992.
</P>
<P>
He said Italy will hold talks with its EU partners on re-entry.
</P>
<P>
Prodi's speech is seen by observers here as a summary of
Italy's work during its six months holding the rotating presidency
of the EU and set the tone for Friday's Florence summit at the
same time.

on cardiovascular system diseases.
</P>
<P>
His outstanding achievements won him honorary titles of seven
medical institutes in the United States, Britain and the former
Soviet Union, as well as international surgical societies.
</P>
<P>
Wu wrote 700 medical research papers and helped trained several
generations of medical workers over the past seven decades.

<HEADLINE> Nation Would Not Forget The Poor in Revolutionary Cradle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese people throughout the nation
have made significant efforts to help drop-outs in Yan'an return
to school.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, 79 "Hope Schools" funded with public donations have
been built there, and have enrolled 7,367 children who cannot
afford tuition fees.
</P>
<P>
Yan'an was the most famous site of the Chinese revolution. It
was the headquarters of the Chinese Communist Party in the 1930s,
and its political reputation was spread overseas by Edgar Snow, an
American reporter who visited there and wrote "The Red Star Over
China."
</P>
<P>
The city has no notable economic developments, partly due to
its rigid natural conditions.
</P>
<P>
Farmers' incomes are comparatively low, and their children have
to quit school to work in farmlands. Many villages have no money to
build classrooms.
</P>
<P>
The situation has aroused concern in the central government
and the public. Major donations have poured in from Beijing
and other provinces.
</P>
<P>
By the end of May, children in Yan'an had received 25.7 million
yuan worth of donations, or three million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Every year, more than one million Chinese children quit school

DHAKA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh Nationalist Party
(BNP) will hold an emergency meeting today to decide whether it
should accept the results of the polls to join the new parliament.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Yeltsin Revamps Inner Circle for Run-off Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 20 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin sacked
several key figures in his entourage in the space of three days in
a bid to woo losers in the June 16 presidential poll and to unite
his team for the July 3 runoff round.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who will stand against communist leader Gennady
Zyuganov on July 3, today fired First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg
Soskovets, Federal Security Service chief Mikhail Barsukov and
top bodyguard Alexander Korzhakov. On Tuesday, he dismissed
Defence Minister Pavel Grachev.
</P>
<P>
The shake-up drew quick praise from liberal economist Grigory
Yavlinsky, who finished fourth in the first round of the election
and whose endorsement has been sought desperately by Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Yavlinsky had conditioned his support on the firing of the
four. But he said he would wait for Yeltsin's next step before
deciding whether to throw his weight behind the president.
</P>
<P>
However, after Grachev's dismissal, he hinted at possible
backing for Yeltsin when, in a television phone-in program
Tuesday, he called on his supporters to vote against Zyuganov and
not to vote against both.
</P>
<P>
Grachev's dismissal was the direct result of the promotion of
his old foe, retired general Alexander Lebed, a black horse in the
first round of the polls. Yeltsin appointed Lebed the new head of
the powerful Security Council and his national security assistant.
</P>
<P>
Lebed came in a strong third in Sunday's polls with nearly 15
percent of the vote, behind Zyuganov's 32 percent and Yeltsin's 35
percent.
</P>
<P>
But it was unclear whether Lebed had a direct role in today's
dismissals.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Lebed said that the decision to shake up
the presidential team was taken by Yeltsin himself.
</P>
<P>
But he said that there had been an attempt to put the president
under pressure by means of force, suggesting that there was a
possible power struggle within Yeltsin's immediate circle, as
alleged by Zyuganov shortly after the dismissals were announced.
</P>
<P>
Lebed was partly referring to the arrests Wednesday night of
two of Yeltsin's leading campaigners on the orders of Korzhakov
and Barsukov for allegedly taking out a large amount of hard
currency from a government building.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's campaign chief Anatoly Chubais, former first deputy
prime minister and advocate of radical reform, seemed to confirm
the suggestion of a power struggle, calling the four sacked
officials "hard-liners" used to resolving issues by force.
</P>
<P>
He said the personnel changes signaled an end to the
"tug-of-war" between the "democratic" and "hard-line" wings in the
presidential team.
</P>
<P>
Chubais said that the "resolute" decision by Yeltsin to fire
the four demonstrated his unique political potential. The
presidential elections will be won by "a new Yeltsin with a new,
renewed team," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency said that the reshuffle defused a
"bomb" planted under Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin as
Barsukov and Korzhakov had wanted Soskovets, their "godfather," to
replace him.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe the "tug-of-war" within the president's
inner circle has been going on from the outset of the election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Itar-Tass said another reason for Korzhakov's ouster was his
constant interference in political and personnel
decisions. Yeltsin had told him "not to meddle in politics" after
the bodyguard said publicly that the elections should be
postponed, causing a furore in the Zyuganov camp and concern in
Western capitals.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Sergei Medvedev said Yeltsin made the
decision to remove the four men after thoroughly analyzing the
situation and holding talks with Chernomyrdin, Chubais and Lebed.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, the president came to the conclusion that it was
time to renew the team in order to avoid false rumors, " he said.

<HEADLINE> China Indignant at German Parliament's Resolution Over Tibet, Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- China today expressed its
indignation over a resolution that calls for the improvement of
human rights in Tibet, which was passed by the Federal Parliament
of Germany on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on the resolution, Chinese Foreign
Ministry Spokesman Shen Guofang said that the Federal Parliament
of Germany discussed and adopted a so-called resolution on
improvement of the human rights situation in Tibet on June 20 in
spite of serious representations by the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
"This action of the federal parliament is an open violation of
the principle of the international norm, and a gross interference in
the internal affairs of China, at which we express our strong
discontent and indignation," Shen noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that the German Parliament's resolution concerning
Tibet has hurt the feelings of the Chinese people and is
detrimental to the relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"Such perverse acts will eventually bring harm to Germany's
fundamental and long-term interests," the spokesman said.

KATHMANDU, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Sher
Bahadur Deuba urged universities and colleges in the country to
develop technical and vocational courses to ensure a quality
higher education system.
</P>
<P>
At a time when the country faces a lack of skilled and

the requirements of economic development, he said here Thursday at
a meeting of Kathmandu University Council.
</P>
<P>
Deuba, chancellor of the university, praised the university's
role in maintaining sustainable development in higher education by
launching subjects in science, technology and management.
</P>

According to him, two new universities to be set up soon and a
three-year bachelor's degree program newly introduced in the

The government would consider suggestions for setting up a
national loans and scholarship fund for higher education, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Russian Election Will Go on as Scheduled: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The second round of Russia's
presidential election will be held on July 3 as scheduled, despite
rumors of a coup attempt and the sacking of several senior
officials, Russian President Boris Yeltsin's spokesman Sergei
Medvedev said today.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin today dismissed Alexander Korzhakov, head of the
Presidential Security Service, Mikhail Barsukov, head of the
Federal Security Service, and Oleg Soskovets, a first deputy prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
The surprise sackings came three days after the president fired
Defense Minister Pavel Grachev and appointed Alexander Lebed the
new head of the powerful Security Council and his national
security advisor.
</P>
<P>
Observers here say these developments will have a significant
impact on the presidential vote and Russia's political structure.
</P>
<P>
The firing of Korzhakov and Barsukov was triggered by the
arrest of two leading members of Yeltsin's campaign staff by the
Presidential Security Service on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Report said the two men were carrying about half a million
U.S. dollars in a box when they were arrested, and were released
after hours of interrogation.
</P>
<P>
Their arrest was seen by some as an attempt to stage a coup to
sabotage the second round of the presidential poll, which will be
held on July 3 after no candidate won majority votes in the
presidential election on June 16.
</P>
<P>
Medvedev said that the military general prosecutor had been
appointed to investigate the "attempted internal coup."
</P>
<P>
On the dismissal of Soskovets, the spokesman said the president
made the decision based on a report by Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin, which accused the first deputy prime minister of
committing serious mistakes in restructuring industry and
converting the defense industry to civilian production.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin at a cabinet meeting today appointed deputy prime
minister Oleg Lobov to replace Soskovets.
</P>
<P>
The Russian prime minister also said that as the presidential
runoff approaches, the government must be mobilized to garner
every possible vote for the president.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also signed orders today appointing Yuri Krapivin as
the acting head of the Presidential Security Service and Nikolai
Kovalov as the acting head of the Federal Security Service.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's main rival for the presidency, Communist Party leader
Gennady Zyuganov, issued a statement today warning against
"sabotaging the second round of presidential election and the
unity of the country," and demanding that a fair election be held
on the scheduled date.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Awami (people's) League
(AL), which emerged as the largest party in the just-ended
parliamentary elections, is likely to be invited to form the next
government, according to sources in the presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
The source said that President Abdur Rahman Biswas is likely to
invite the AL to form the new government Sunday after the
completion of the oath-taking of the MPs-elect.
</P>
<P>
Chief Election Commissioner M. Abu Hena called on the president
Thursday to hand over the official gazette containing the names of
the MPs-elect.
</P>
<P>
President Biswas Thursday said that he would call the leader of
the largest party to form government just after the completion of
oath of affirmation of all MPs-elect.
</P>
<P>
According to the Election Commission (EC), the AL has won 146
out of 299 parliamentary seats while its arch rival, the ex-ruling
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) won 116 and the Jatiya
(national) Party (JP) bagged 31 seats.
</P>
<P>
It was learnt that although the AL has been poised to form the
new cabinet, the BNP is making its utmost to persuade the JP and
the Jamaat-e-Islami, which has won 3 seats in the election, to
join forces for a clear majority to form the new government. But
the JP has earlier lent its support to the AL unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
As the oath taking of the newly elected MPs begins this
afternoon, the AL is now waiting for a presidential invitation to
form the government, AL sources said, disclosing that its
stalwarts have put their heads together to give final touches to
the new cabinet.

KATHMANDU, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will help Nepal improve
its economic management capacity under an innovative program
sponsored by the World Bank, officials here said.
</P>
<P>
Over the next few months, officials of Nepal's National
Planning Commission (NPC) and Finance Ministry will draw on the
experience of economic development in Malaysia by being attached
at Malaysian government agencies.
</P>
<P>
Under a twinning arrangement between the NPC and its

officials would also receive formal training at the Malaysian
Staff College, a press release of the World Bank Nepal Office

<P>
The World Bank is supporting the program with a grant of
200,000 US dollars from its Institutional Development Fund which
is aimed at funding capacity-building efforts in developing
countries, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
The program would share experiences in economic planning and
development between the two countries and expose Nepali officials
to public expenditure management and project monitoring practices
in Malaysia, it said.

<HEADLINE> Strong Wool Demand Expected In Australian Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Australian wool growers and
exporters received some positive news this week, with higher
prices, strong demand expected to continue next week.
</P>
<P>
The Eastern Market indicator closed the week Thursday night up
12 Australian cents at 595 cents/kilogram clean, on a total of
54,426 bales with a low 7.5 percent pass in freight rates.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Council of Wool Exporters said the Wool
Commodity Group's announcement of unchanged 1996-97 freight rates
was good news for the industry.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Federal Minister for Primary Industries and
Energy John Anderson reiterated Thursday that there would be no
changes to the present fixed schedule -- which requires 182,000
bales to be sold every quarter -- before July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Wesfarmers Dalgety's Wool Weekly said today that prices over
the past week showed welcome strength in response to the smaller
offering and the upcoming three-week sale recess.
</P>
<P>
"This is forcing buyers into a squeeze situation, that is,
taking stock to cover orders before the break," Wesfarmers Dalgety
said.
</P>
<P>
This strength in demand is believed to remain with next week
being the final sale for the season and with good Asian inquiry
for July shipment indent orders.
</P>
<P>
However, "it could be overshadowed by the large quantity of
wool coming on offer next week which is twice the size of this
week's," the Weekly said.

<HEADLINE> Italy's Prime Minister Urges EU to Move On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 20 (Xinhua) -- On the eve of the European Union (EU)
summit in Florence, Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi has urged
the EU to move on despite the many differences among its members.
</P>
<P>
The European Union must move ahead, it simply cannot come to a
halt, the new prime minister told the Florence-based European
University Institute today.
</P>
<P>
He said differences over European Monetary Union (EMU) should
not drag the EU to a standstill as certain EU members could join
the single currency later than others.
</P>
<P>
The European train cannot move at the slowest speed, he added.
</P>
<P>
The EU is targeting to launch a single European currency, the
Euro, by January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
But scepticism is growing over whether the deadline can be met
as few members have been able to fulfill the EMU criteria due to
their sluggish economy.
</P>
<P>
Under the Maastricht Treaty, the budget deficit and national
debt of a member country must not exceed 3 and 60 percent
respectively of its GDP in order to join the EMU.
</P>
<P>
In his remarks, Prodi played down the mad cow crisis, which is
expected to be one of the dominant topics at the Florence summit,
saying that "the worst has passed" in the row over the EU-imposed
ban on British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
Britain's posture of "non-cooperation" with the EU until the
ban is lifted is worrisome but does not represent overall British
policy and London will contribute to the construction of the EU,
Prodi said.
</P>
<P>
But he added that it was necessary to bring Britain back on the
track of cooperation with the 15-member EU.
</P>
<P>
The EU Commission imposed a worldwide ban on the export of
British beef and cattle by-products in March after links were
suspected between mad cow disease and its fatal human equivalent,
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease.
</P>
<P>
On the question of the lira, Prodi said the Italian currency
must aim for re-entry into Europe's Exchange Rate Mechanism, which
Italy quit in September 1992.
</P>
<P>
He said Italy will hold talks with its EU partners on re-entry.
</P>
<P>
Prodi's speech is seen by observers here as a summary of
Italy's work during its six months holding the rotating presidency
of the EU and set the tone for Friday's Florence summit at the
same time.

<HEADLINE> Menem Urges Speeding Up Airports Concessioning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President Carlos
Menem said today that it is urgent to accelerate the process of
airports concessioning in his country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a cabinet meeting, Menem requested the Congress to
draw up a regulatory law to start the process as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine government had decided to offer commercial
management concessions, including signals, mail depots, commercial
installations and other services, of 58 airports for 25-year
terms, starting from January 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, the concessioning project is still 25 percent short of
completion, said Elsa Correa de Pavon, the Cabinet official in
charge of coordination of the project.
</P>
<P>
The project will be passed to the Congress deputies, who are
expected to determine a norm to regulate the concessioning process
and form organizations to control the concessionaries.

dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan province
has been developing international shipping on the Lancang-Mekong
river in recent years, in coordination with neighboring Myanmar,
Laos and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The province has 40 ships engaged in international shipping on
the river, and 43,000 tons of cargo are carried out of the country
each year, compared with just 500 tons in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The Lancang-Mekong River rises in the Tanggula Range in Qinghai
province, and flows through Qinghai, Tibet Autonomous Region and
Yunnan, and then through Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and
Viet Nam before reaching the sea in Ho Chi Min city.
</P>
<P>
The 4,880-km-long river is the biggest in southeast Asia, and
2,161 km of it are in China. It is the top water transport passage
linking Yunnan province and southwest China with southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan has been harnessing different sections of the river
since 1987. And the four countries along the upper reaches of the
Mekong river - China, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand - have conducted
four joint surveys in different seasons to prepare for developing
shipping and harnessing the channels.
</P>
<P>
In 1994 China and Laos became the first to sign a bilateral
pact on passenger and cargo transport on Lancang-Mekong river.
</P>
<P>
Jinghong and Simao ports in Xishuang Banna have been approved
as national category first ports of entry.

<P>
LANZHOU, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The Gansu Corridor, northwest
China, has witnessed good harvests in the past two years, thanks
to a decade-long tree-planting drive.
</P>
<P>
The corridor is situated in Gansu Province and part of the
famous "Silk Road", which played an important role in trade and
interflow of culture between China, Western Asia and Europe in
ancient times. It has been hit by its worst drought in the past 60
years.
</P>
<P>
Today a huge "green dragon" appeared in the region, and
local ecological conditions have improved and the barren lands
are covered with trees.
</P>
<P>
So far, the province has planted 330,000 hectares of forests to
help fix water and soil, with 240,000 ha. in the corridor as a
windbreak, which has protected 400,000 ha of farmland. Yesterday's
"yellow dragon" has turned into a large commodity grain producing
base.

<HEADLINE> Cause of Chinese Explorer's Death Still Unknown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The cause of death of a Chinese
explorer discovered in northwest China's Lop Nur desert remains a
mystery, according to rescuers.
</P>
<P>
The remains of Yu Chunshun, 48, were buried at the place where
he was found dead in his tent Tuesday morning. But the rescuers
said circumstances surrounding his death remain unexplained, as
there is no evidence to prove he was killed by starvation or in a
sandstorm.
</P>
<P>
Yu was a well-known Shanghai explorer who had successfully
walked through the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and Takalamakan
Desert. He began his journey to the ruin of ancient Loulan City on
June 6, accompanied by five cameramen and two local guides.
</P>
<P>
He entered the Lop Nur desert alone on June 11, carrying with
him a two-day supply of food and water.
</P>
<P>
Yu planned to meet his fellow explorers three days later, but
they lost contact with him on June 13.
</P>
<P>
Yu's body was recovered following rescue efforts that included
a 70-hour helicopter search. Rescuers described him as "being
black and covered with blisters."
</P>
<P>
The rescuers found a bag half-full of dried beef and a dagger
beside Yu, and so have discounted the theory that he died of
starvation. However, a medical examiner found no food in Yu's
stomach after dissecting the body.
</P>
<P>
The rescuers also believed Yu could have escaped from
sandstorms by taking shelter in his tent.
</P>
<P>
It has not been disclosed if Yu ran out of water and died of
dehydration.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that when Yu began his desert adventure, there
was a gale and the ground temperature was 70 degrees centigrade.
</P>
<P>
In 1981, Peng Jiamu, a noted Chinese scientist, was reported
missing from Lop Nur, and no conclusions have ever been made about
his disappearance.

<HEADLINE> Ten-Year Program Tackles Mental Problems in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Public Health and
the World Health Organization (WHO) have jointly launched a
10-year program to combat mental health problems in China,
reported today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The so-called "decade of the brain" strategy is designed to
curb increase in mental disorders and promote mental health,
Costae Silva, division chief in charge of mental health for WHO,
said yesterday in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The drive will upgrade the country's diagnosis and treatment of
mental illness, to reduce mortality and disability rates resulting
from mental problems and spare medical resources.
</P>
<P>
China, like the rest of the world, has experienced an increase
in mental health patients in the past decade as a result of rapid
industrialization, growth in social tension and the aging of the
population.
</P>
<P>
The latest survey of 23,000 people in seven cities showed more
than 11 people in 1,000 suffer from mental disorders. Five in
1,000 people aged 15 and up are mentally disabled.
</P>
<P>
Another 3.53 per thousand are mentally handicapped, of which
most are children or elderly people.
</P>
<P>
Since the "decade of the brain" program was initiated in the
United States in 1990, similar activities have been carried out in
six countries.
</P>
<P>
Mental health will be of vital concern to medical workers in
the next century, and especially important to China which has a
big population and is modernizing very rapidly, said Silva.
</P>
<P>
He said WHO will continue to train Chinese professionals and
provide technical guidance for the country.

<P>
PARIS June 20 (Xinhua) -- Last week's announcement by the
Bosnian Croats that they were setting up an independent republic
called Herceg-Bosna in southwestern Bosnia violates the Dayton
peace agreement, a spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry said
today.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government of the Republic of Croatia to pressure
the Bosnian Croats to revoke their decision, announced on June 15.
</P>
<P>
Only two entities -- the Muslim-Croat federation composed of
Bosnian Muslims and Croats and the Bosnian Serb Republic of Srpska
-- are recognized in Bosnia-Herzegovina according to the Dayton
agreement initiated in November 1995, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Italy, which holds the rotating presidency of the European
Union, notified Croatian authorities today that the
re-establishment of the Republic of Herceg-Bosna is a clear breach
of the terms of the Dayton agreement.
</P>
<P>
Herceg-Bosna was set up by the Bosnian Croats in 1993 during
the war in Bosnia. It has never been recognized by the

MEXICO CITY, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
economic news briefs in Latin America over the past few days.
</P>
<P>
Mexican Foreign Currency Reserves Down
</P>
<P>
MEXICO CITY -- The Bank of Mexico said Tuesday that the
country's net foreign exchange reserves diminished 95 million
U.S. dollars from June 7 to 14.
</P>
<P>
The decrease was caused by the fact that the state-owned oil
enterprise Petroleos Mexicanos took 97 million dollars out of the
Bank of Mexico for its payment.
</P>
<P>
Mexican Enterprises to Continue Operating in Cuba
</P>
<P>
MEXICO CITY -- Some 200 Mexican companies will continue doing
business in Cuba despite the threat of sanctions decreed by the
United States based on the Helms-Burton law.
</P>
<P>
The companies, affiliated to the National Chamber of the
Transformation Industry (Canacintra), are backed by the efforts of
the Mexican and Canadian governments to resist the
extraterritorial effects of that law, said Canacintra president
Rene Ortiz Munoz.
</P>
<P>
Mexico and Canada had jointly announced that they will invoke
the North American Free Trade Agreement to bar the enforcement of
the Helms-Burton law.

<HEADLINE> International Tour Group Departs down Silk Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The first international tour group
has set out on the trail of the ancient Silk Road, according to
today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
Dr. Harsh Varma, regional representative of Asia to the World
Tourism Organization (WTO), led his 69-member delegation off last
night to explore the road, which links Xi'an, capital of the Tang
Dynasty (618-907), with Central Asia via Gansu and Xinjiang in
Northwest China.
</P>
<P>
The trip on the Marco Polo Express will go through the Chinese
section of the Silk Road, visiting the Maijishan Grottoes,
Jiayuguan Pass, the Mogao Grottoes and Turpan, the ancient city of
Jiaohe and Heavenly Lake.
</P>
<P>
It will be completed on June 27.
</P>
<P>
With Xi'an as the starting point, the 2,135-year-old Silk Road,
started in 139 BC, stretches for more than 7,000 km across western
China, central Asia and western Asia to Europe. It used to be the
most important international trade route and a link between
Eastern and Western civilizations.
</P>
<P>
To promote the Silk Road in the world tourism market is the aim
of a joint venture project designed by WTO and the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in 1993.
</P>
<P>
While China started to develop international tourism along the
route in 1979. the 4000-km China section of the road is viewed by
many to be the most attractive theme route among the established
tourism products.
</P>
<P>
In past years, thousands of foreign visitors have visited the
ancient road, according to Yang Liuyin, director of the Department
of Marketing and Promotion of the China National Tourism
Administration (CNTA).

<HEADLINE> Austria Expects EU Summit Not to Be "Rule by Beef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky
on Thursday expected the forthcoming EU summit would not be "ruled
by the beef catastrophe," saying the issues of unemployment and
security should top the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint conference with Foreign Minister Wolfgang
Schuessel, Vranitzky demanded that targets be set by an EU treaty
for employment. He called for development of infrastructure and
small and medium-sized enterprises to create jobs for the union's
18 million jobless people.
</P>
<P>
The chancellor also suggested the fight against international
drug trafficking be touched upon at the summit, which is to open
Friday in Florence, Italy.
</P>
<P>
Over the "mad cow" crisis, Schuessel expressed optimism that
the showdown between Britain and its EU partners could be resolved
at the Florence summit.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian foreign minister asked Britain to end its
obstruction policy "immediately and unconditionally."
</P>
<P>
Austria supports the EU commission's proposal to proceed with a
gradual lift of the ban on the British beef export, he said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Rice Exports May Overtake Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's rice exports this year
could exceed the target of five million tons, according to the
Rice Exporters Association.
</P>
<P>
Some 2.8 million tons, more than half the targeted volume, were
exported in the first five months alone, Vorapongse Pitchpongsa,
president of the association, was quoted today by local press as
saying.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the year, the figure is expected to rise to five
million tons, worth 40,000 million baht (1,600 million US
dollars), Vorapongse said.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that rice exporters still face problems
such as labor shortage, not enough barges and ports, and high
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thai Commerce Minister Chucheep Harnsawat said the
country's exports of high-quality fragrant rice were successful
because competition was weak.
</P>
<P>
A total of 611,000 tons of fragrant rice were exported in the
first five months, up 19.8 percent from the same period past year.
</P>
<P>
The contribution of fragrant rice was up from 22 percent of
total rice exports last year to 24 percent this year, and the
trend is likely to continue.
</P>
<P>
Chucheep said exports of low-quality Thai rice face competition
from India and Vietnam, so Thai farmers should continue shifting
to production of high-quality rice.

Thailand is already involved in many international trade pacts
including the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN),

<HEADLINE> Bosnia Envoy Condemns Persecution of Sarajevo Serbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The office of the chief
international mediator for Bosnia today accused the Muslims of
intimidating and persecuting the Serbs remaining in Sarajevo after
part of the city was handed over to Muslim control.
</P>
<P>
"We condemn the beating and harassment of Serbs in Sarajevo
suburbs," Colum Murphy, spokesman for the High Representative for
Bosnia Carl Bildt, told reporters in Sarajevo, capital of the
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
"This must stop immediately and we think that Sarajevo should
be a city on a hill -- an example to the rest of Bosnia," he added.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton peace agreement that ended the war in Bosnia,
five Serb-held municipalities in Sarajevo were handed over to the
Muslim-Croat federation on March 19.
</P>
<P>
But before the hand-over, tens of thousands of Sarajevo Serbs
fled to other Serb territories for fear of reprisal from their
former enemies, the Muslims and Croats.
</P>
<P>
Murphy warned that if the remaining 8,000 Serbs also choose to
leave after months of persecution, Sarajevo will lose its status
as a multi-ethnic city.
</P>
<P>
Murphy's remarks followed a similar comments by Bildt's other
spokesman Michael Steiner on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Steiner said that in the municipalities formerly controlled by
the Serbs, Serb homes are being robbed every day, windows are
broken at night and things taken out of houses.
</P>
<P>
He said the Muslim-Croat government lacked the political will to
put a stop to what he called the shameful persecution of Sarajevo
Serbs.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Strikes Back U.S. Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The United States lied shamelessly
when talking about Cuba's compensations to U.S. enterprises, the
official Cuban daily "Granma" said today.
</P>
<P>
Granma referred to the U.S. State Department spokesman Nocholas
Burns' statement on June 18 in Washington which said Cuba never
agreed to discuss with the United States the theme of
compensations to U.S. enterprises nationalized by the Cuban
revolution.
</P>
<P>
The story published by Granma lashes out at Burns' statement by
calling it "false" and "an insult to the intelligence of the
persons to whom those words were addressed."
</P>
<P>
Burns knows very well that the compensation mechanism was
created and operated with other countries also affected, said the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The exception was Washington, which in violation of the
international juridical order, tried to impose its conditions when
the island confiscated the U.S. assets in response to the oil
embargo and the cut to the sugar quota.
</P>
<P>
Granma referred in another article to an answer from the
U.S. government to a Cuban foreign ministry communique in 1960
concerning a commission to travel to Cuba to discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
The communique said the U.S. government refused to accept the
conditions set by the Cuban government to resume bilateral
contacts between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has maintained a hostile attitude toward Cuba and
imposed a trade embargo to this island country since 1961 when
Fidel Castro launched Cuba's socialist revolution.
</P>
<P>
In March this year, the U.S. adopted a new anti-Cuban
legislation, called the Helms-Burton law after Cuba downed two
light aircraft piloted by the U.S.-based Cuban exiles. The law
allows Cuban exiles who have become U.S. citizens to sue for
compensation from foreign business people who "traffic" in
property expropriated by the Cuban government.

MANAGUA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- A commission made up of members
from the Organization of American States (OAS) and the Supreme
Electoral Council (SEC) of Nicaragua started today to negotiate
with Honduras on the release of 28 kidnapped SEC officials.
</P>
<P>
The officials, who were transporting blank documents for the

group of armed men on the banks of the Coco River, near Honduras,
in the north of the country and were taken to Honduran territory,
the CSE President Rosa Marina Zelaya said.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers are rearmed former combatants in the Nicaraguan
revolutionary war. They are demanding the total withdrawal of
government troops deployed along the Coco River and the creation
of a commission made up of members of the Nicaraguan and Honduran
governments to negotiate the release of the kidnapped,
</P>
<P>
The CSE president said she is very concerned about the safety
of the kidnapped officials and that she will request the mediation

Nicaraguan President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro said that her
government is contacting the Honduran government to have the
kidnapped officials returned to Nicaragua.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Rejects Reports on Shootdown of U.S. Planes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Cuban Foreign Ministry today
rejected versions by some news agencies of an alleged report to be
made by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) on
the downing by Cuban Air Force of two U.S. light planes that
invaded Cuba's air space earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
ICAO is investigating the downing on February 24 of two light
planes piloted by Cuban exiles when they apparently were violating
Cuban sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Miguel Alfonso, spokesman for the Cuban
Foreign Ministry, dismissed the sayings quoted from the report,
saying he was not surprised by the capacity of certain U.S. news
organizations to absorb "leaks."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said there is not yet a final result of the ICAO
investigation, and it is very unusual that the report from the
Montreal-based ICAO has been circulated abroad before it is made
public.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Phil Jackson has returned as
the head coach of the newly crowned MBA champion Chicago Bulls as
he signed a one-year contract with the team on Thursday, according
to a source in the club's organization in Deerfield of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
Financial terms were not disclosed, but there were broadcast
reports earlier in the day saying the contract was for two million
dollars to 2.5 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Jackson, who has guided the Bulls to four NBA titles in the
last six years, had been seeking a two-year deal but also had
threatened to sit out the 1996-97 season if he couldn't get what
he considered a fair contract.
</P>
<P>
Jackson was named NBA coach of the year after leading the Bulls
to a league-record of 72-10 this season. Chicago then beat Miami,
New York and Orlando in the playoffs before capping one of the
greatest seasons in history by beating Seattle 4-2 in the NBA
Finals.
</P>
<P>
In seven years, Jackson, 50, has the best regular-season
winning percentage ever at 72.1% (414-160) and the all-time best
playoff mark at 72.3% (81-31). This year's championship follows
titles in 1991, 1992 and 1993.

<HEADLINE> Czech to Levy More Taxes on Imported EU Potato </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Czech government Thursday
decided to increase its taxes on imported EU potato, beginning from
July this year, from 10 percent to 144 percent.
</P>
<P>
The decision is seen as a measure to protect the interests of
potato planters and consumers in the country.
</P>
<P>
Mass imported potato, which is about 1.7-2.7 corunas (six to
nine U.S. cents) cheaper per kilogram than the local, have caused
the country's potato growers to lose millions of corunas each
year, official figures show.
</P>
<P>
In the past years, the European Union countries have dumped
hundreds and thousands of tons of potato, which is of worse
quality than the local potato, to the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
From May 15 to June 16 alone, EU nations exported 11,000 tons
potato to the country.

BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey showed that 260
new TV transmitters have been erected across the country, serving
nearly three million people in mountainous regions.
</P>
<P>
The Cultural Aid Committee (CAC) of the Ministry of Culture has
run a successful "cultural aid campaign" since 1993, aiming to
enrich rural people's knowledge and raise their aspirations,
</P>
<P>
The lack of cultural resources is the largest barrier to rural
economic and social development, according to Li Feng, an official
with the CAC.
</P>
<P>
Financially assisted by both companies and social funds, the
committee is now trying to send technological books and video
cassettes to the countryside.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, CAC has set up more than 25,000
village libraries, covering three percent of all China's
villages. The village libraries, each equipped with at least 100
practical easy-reading books, all provide useful information for
farmers on agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
During the cultural aid campaign, more than 11 million children
in poor rural areas have been paired with the same number of urban
youngsters in an effort to promote exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Some one million of these pairs have set up regular contact by
letter, allowing rural children to gain access to the world beyond
their villages while urban children learn that poverty still
exists.

<HEADLINE> Mandela on Defence Force Depolyment </HEADLINE>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The South African government
has decided to deploy 40000 South African National Defence Force
(SANDF) members throughout the country to help implement the
National Crime Prevention Strategy (NCPS), President Nelson
Mandela said today.
</P>
<P>
He announced the decision during his budget vote debate in the
National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
On another occasion, Mandela wrote to Senate President Kobie
Coetzee and National Assembly Speaker Frene Ginwala, saying he
had authorized the employment of the SANDF with effect from June
19 to uphold law and order in all the nine provinces of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the situation in Kwazulu/Natal, Mandela said the
achievement of true peace in the strife-torn province depended
not only on the fight against crime, but also on the political
parties.
</P>
<P>
Although progress has been made particularly as a result of
improved intelligence capacities and the use of focused task groups,
the situation in Kwazulu/Natal is still the cause for concern, said the
president.

<HEADLINE> Sarajevo Denounces Karadzic's Nomination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian government on
Thursday warned that the country's upcoming elections could be
endangered by the nomination of Radovan Karadzic as a candidate.
</P>
<P>
Local press here quoted Bosnian prime minister Hasan Muratovic
as saying that Karadzic, president of Republika Srpska but
indicted by an international court for war crimes, "cannot be a
candidate" under the Dayton agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Dayton agreement divides Bosnia into two entities -- the
Serb republic and the Muslim-Croat federation bridged over by a
central government -- and calls for elections at all levels by
mid-September.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, a local unit in Pale of Karadzic's Serbian
Democratic Party (SDS) nominated him as the candidate to run again
for president of the Republika Srpska.
</P>
<P>
Muratovic called the nomination a scheme by the SDS to disrupt
the elections.
</P>
<P>
"We warned the international community many times...the only
way to have elections and to change the situation is to get rid of
Karadzic," Muratovic said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the United States to put pressure on Serbian president
Slobodan Milosevic or use Nato peace-keeping forces in Bosnia to
remove Karadzic from the political scene.
