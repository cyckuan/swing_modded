<HEADLINE> Russian Duma Speaker Calls on Yeltsin to Sack Chubais </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The speaker of Russia's State Duma
Gennady Seleznyov today demanded the sacking of presidential chief
of staff Anatoly Chubais over his alleged role in the appointment
of businessman Boris Berezovsky as deputy chief of national
security.
</P>
<P>
"By insisting on the immediate dismissal of the presidential
chief of staff Chubais I do not have the slightest doubt that I am
expressing the opinion of an absolute majority of the Russian
citizens," Seleznyov said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The speaker of the Russian lower house of parliament also
threatened to boycott meetings of the new four-man Consultative
Council, set up to govern the country when President Boris Yeltsin
is ill, if Chubais is present. Chubais, as chief of staff, will
represent Yeltsin on the council while the president is preparing
for heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin responded immediately to Seleznyov's demands through
his spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky. He said in a statement that
Yeltsin never allowed himself to meddle in appointments made in
either house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
The president's stand is based on his strict observance of the
Russian Constitution and of the principle of separation of powers,
Yastrzhembsky noted and he expects other officials in authority to
act in the same vein.
</P>
<P>
The presidential press service announced overnight that Yeltsin
had appointed Berezovsky and Colonel-General Leonid Mayorov as
deputies to the Russian Security Council secretary, Ivan Rybkin,
who replaced the sacked Alexander Lebed some two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov described the appointment as "one of the most serious
mistakes in the personnel policy" of the president, and claimed
that Chubais was behind this appointment.
</P>
<P>
He also described Berezovsky, one of the top leaders of the
major Public Russian Television channel (ORT), as a "person who
staged an anti-Russian information coup on the first TV channel."
</P>
<P>
"Now he is infiltrating the holy sanctum, into the issues of
the security of the Russian state," the Duma speaker said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "I am sure that his appointment to such a high post
could not have taken place without the personal interest and
protection of presidential administration chief Chubais.
</P>
<P>
"It was Chubais who represented the interests of the state
during the creation of the dubious joint-stock company named
ORT," he said.
</P>
<P>
The state holds 51 percent shares of ORT, once the major
Soviet Channel 1. The remaining 49 percent is owned by private
companies, mostly by LogoVAZ, of which Berezovsky is the
head.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov also demanded new security council chief Rybkin to
publicly explain to Russians how this appointment was made.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- China and Japan, which are
close neighbors separated by only a thin strip of water, should
keep the the two peoples' friendships for generations, Premier Li
Peng said today during a meeting with Miho Mayama, chairman of
Japan's Shinsei Sakuza.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the two peoples are willing to live in peace and
to prevent the misfortunes of history from being repeated.
</P>
<P>
He praised the Japanese artists as envoys of friendship and
peace and their singing and dancing for peace and development in
the world.
</P>
<P>
The troupe has visited China many times in the past, and has
done a great deal of work in advancing friendship between the two
peoples, Li noted, expressing his admiration.
</P>
<P>
The troupe has been well received by Chinese audience, and was
praised and encouraged by late Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai, who
asked the artists to continue to "perform for the ordinary people."
</P>
<P>
Miho Mayama said that there are some persons in Japan who do
not take a correct approach toward history, and this has filled
the Japanese people with indignation.
</P>

She said the peace-loving Japanese people hope to convey their
cherishing of Japanese-Chinese friendship to the Chinese people

<HEADLINE> EC Urges to Step up Enforcement of Single Market Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission(EC )
today adopted a report calling for proper enforcement of common
rules across the entire Single Market.
</P>
<P>
The report on the impact and effectiveness of the Single Market
revealed "solid evidence of the positive effects" of the Single
Market in terms of growth, employment, trade and greater
competition.
</P>
<P>
However, the EC's analysis suggested that the benefits and
opportunities "would have been even greater" if Member States had
been more diligent in putting in place the Single Market measures
and applying the principles of the Community law on which they are
based.
</P>
<P>
In the report, the EC outlined a series of clear policy
recommendations for action at national and Community levels so
that the Single Market's full potential can be achieved.
</P>
<P>
The EC urged that enforcement of Single Market legislation and
Maastricht Treaty rules be stepped up and more resources be
committed to this task.
</P>
<P>
It also called for "vigorous action" to be taken to reduce
excessive regulation at national level which inhibited both
competition and competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
At the Community level, it said, further efforts must be made
to complete the work in areas such as abolition of border controls
on persons, taxation and company law and that Community policies
in related areas such as competition, information and environment
need to be developed further.
</P>
<P>
The report underlined that the introduction of a single
currency in 1999 would also make the Single market more effective,
by among other things eliminating transaction costs and exchange
risks.
</P>
<P>
It also called for a new commitment to the Single Market from
national authorities, the European Institutions and economic
operators themselves and a series of specific priority measures
were outlined in the report.

<HEADLINE> Solana Says No Pact With Russia in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, October 30 (Xinhua) -- NATO chief Javier Solana
today denied the military alliance would sign a treaty or charter
with Russia this year.
</P>
<P>
However, the NATO secretary general indicated that an agreement
with Russia on future relations could be reached in mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Russia's Interfax news agency had quoted Solana as
saying in Brussels that a deal could be made in 1996. But aides
travelling with him to Stockholm denied the report.
</P>
<P>
AFP quoted NATO spokesman Jamie Shea on Tuesday as saying that
there could be no signing in 1996 as the alliance had not started
discussions with Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Russia has strongly opposed NATO's planned eastward expansion,
fearing that the move to include the former Warsaw Pact nations
will pose a threat to Russia's national security.
</P>
<P>
Solana, the first NATO chief to visit neutral Sweden, will also
visit another neutral state, Finland. He is trying to persuade the
two countries to participate more actively in the Partnership for
Peace program, a cooperation program with former Soviet bloc
countries who want to join NATO.
</P>
<P>
He is also expected to discuss plans for a new peacekeeping
force in Bosnia after the mandate of the present IFOR troops
expires in December.

<HEADLINE> Russian FM Urges Peacemaking With Continuity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said here today that the peacemaking process in the
Middle East should advance "with a continuity" and with the
outcomes and agreements already reached.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the end of a meeting with his
Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa, Primakov noted that the position
was within the policy of Russia, which had played the role of a
sponsor since the 1991 Madrid conference on peace in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
Russia supported the achievements Israel and Arab parties have
already made in their negotiations, Primakov said, urging every
effort to be made to jumpstart the Arab-Israeli talks and the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said that the spirit of Madrid conference should be
respected and carried out with consistency.
</P>
<P>
Russia and the U.S. are the co-sponsors of the October 1991
Madrid peace conference, which formulated the principle of "land
for peace" as the cornerstone for ensuing peace talks on various
tracks.
</P>
<P>
The top Russian diplomat said his country welcomes an active
European role in the peace process. "This reflects a trend of
global multi-polarization," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told the press that Primakov came at a critical time
when every effort should be exerted to bring the peace process
back to track within the context of Madrid conference, Oslo
agreement and the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that Egypt greatly appreciated the Russian role
within the framework of the Madrid peace conference.
</P>
<P>
Russia and the United States co-sponsored the Middle East
peace process, but Russia's role has shrunk considerably in the
recent years.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers held an hour-long meeting at noon
following Primakov's arrival here from Lebanon on the third leg
of his Mideast tour, which was designed to reactivate the peace
process and enhance trade ties.
</P>
<P>
Primakov, reportedly carrying Russian ideas on ways to
reactivate the peace march on all tracks, is also expected to
meet with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak later.
</P>
<P>
Primakov's Mideast tour, which has already taken him to Syria
and Lebanon, also includes Israel, Palestinian self-rule areas
and Jordan.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economic Growth Slowed Down in 3rd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. economy slowed down
dramatically in the third quarter of this year after a quick
increase in the second quarter, the U.S. Commerce Department
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department's report on the gross domestic product (GDP)
showed that the economy's total output of goods and services in
July-September quarter increased by 2.2 percent, less than half
the 4.7 percent rate of increase turned in during the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
The 2.2 percent GDP increase for the third quarter was the
slowest advance since a tiny 0.3 percent rise from October to
December last year. GDP rose 2 percent in the January-March
quarter.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown reflected a significant decrease in demand by
consumers. Consumer spending rose at an annual rate of just 0.4
percent, the weakest performance since a decline of 1 percent in
the final three months of 1991.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of total U.S.
economic activity, had been rising at rates of 3.5 percent and 3.4
percent in the first and second quarters.
</P>
<P>
Business fixed investment increased by 14.7 percent in the
quarter, compared with a gain of 3.8 percent in the second.
</P>
<P>
Adding to the weakness was a deterioration in America's trade
performance with the trade deficit, as measured in the GDP, rising
by 17.5 billion dollars at an annual rate.
</P>
<P>
Government spending decreased by 4.0 percent, in contrast to an
increase of 9.4 percent in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
Businesses added to their stockpiles by 32.5 billion dollars at
an annual rate. Analysts say that such a sharp jump in inventories
could raise worries of sharp production cutbacks in the future.
</P>
<P>
The total GDP in the U.S. increase was 37.1 billion dollars at
an annual rate in the third quarter, following a 78.3 billion rate
of increase in the second quarter. The various changes left GDP,
after adjusting for inflation, at an annual rate of 6.93 trillion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the price pressures eased in the third
quarter with an inflation gauge tied to GDP rising only by 1.9
percent at annual rate, the smallest increase since a 1.8 rise in
the summer of 1993.
</P>
<P>
The price index rose by 2.2 percent in the April-June quarter
and by 2.3 percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The report should be welcomed by U.S. investors hoping for
confirmation that the economy is slowing enough to avoid an
increase by the Federal Reserve (Fed) in interest rates to head
off inflation.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts predicted that the U.S. Fed is likely to leave
interest rates unchanged when they next meet on November 13.

<HEADLINE> French Government to Investigate FN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 30 (Xinhua) -- French Interior Minister
Jean-Louis Debre said today that the government has asked the
Paris Attorney General to investigate an illegal demonstration
held by the far-right National Front (FN) party in Paris last
week.
</P>
<P>
The FN staged two demonstrations last week in Paris, separately
under the Triumphal Arch and before th National Assembly, to
protest the adoption by the parliament of a new law on fighting
racism. Both of them were organized without the permission of the
authorities.
</P>
<P>
"One policeman was attacked and I have asked the Paris
Attorney General to investigate the facts," said Debre at a
hearing at the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The police union of Centrale Unitaire de la Police reported on
October 23 that some police officers were insulted and subjected
to scuffles by FN members when they tried to intervene into an
illegal demonstration by the latter under the Triumphal Arch in
central Paris on October 21.
</P>
<P>
"For me, there are some symbolic places, such as the Triumphal
Arch and the Tomb of Unknown Soldiers, and these cannot be the
object of any political exploitation no matter what it is," said
the minister.
</P>
<P>
Police said that some 300 FN members and supporters gathered
under the Triumphal Arch and tried to place a wreath in front of
the Tomb of Unknown Soldiers, which is located inside the arch.
</P>
<P>
Scuffles took place between FN militants and four policemen who
tried to prevent them from placing the wreath, because the
demonstration did not have the permission of the government.
</P>
<P>
The police union has asked the government to launch lawsuit
against FN over the illegal demonstration.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Nurses Association Appeals for End of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Nurses Association
(ZINA) today appealed to striking nurses to go back to work so
that negotiations on their demands can continue without
interference.
</P>
<P>
ZINA President Clara Nondo said that she had received
assurance from the Ministry of Public Service, Labour and Social
Welfare that no striking nurses would be victimised if they
returned to work today.
</P>
<P>
She said nurses' demands were genuine and they should give the
unified civil service negotiating team more time to discuss their
demands with the government while they are at work.
</P>
<P>
The government yesterday gave an ultimatum to striking nurses
and doctors to go back to work by Wednesday morning or face
permanent dismissal, but the warning has not been heeded.
</P>
<P>
The nurses and junior doctors have been on strike for 10 days,
accusing the government of dragging its feet in addressing their
problems.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time nurses and doctors have gone on strike
in two months.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the police today sealed off the striking
nurses and junior doctors' usual meeting place at the Africa
Unity Square in central Harare as the strikers defied a final

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Calls for Continued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Iran's supreme leader Ali
Khamenei today called for continued struggle against the hostile
practice by the United States to Iran and other third world
countries.
</P>
<P>
He made the call when addressing a large group of high school
and university students here on the eve of the 17th anniversary
of the capture of the U.S. embassy in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that Khamenei's remarks were a complete
ignorance of the recent call from Washington for a dialogue with
Tehran.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Pelletreau said in
Dubai last Thursday that he was hopeful that the U.S. would begin
dialogue with Iran within the next four years if President Bill
Clinton is re-elected in November.
</P>
<P>
In his address, the Iranian leader stressed that the
anti-U.S. struggle must be "perpetually continued."
</P>
<P>
He called Iran's anti-U.S. struggle as a religious duty, but
adding it should not be a military one. "The Iranian struggle is
a cultural one in which students can and should play a role," he
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
He urged the students to study and understand the various
U.S. hostile methods against their country and other third world
countries.
</P>
<P>
On November 4, 1979, hundreds of Iranian students seized the
U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took some 90 persons hostage in
condemnation of U.S. interference in Iran's internal affairs. The
two countries severed diplomatic relations in April 1980.

<HEADLINE> EC Makes Efforts to Ease SME's Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 30 (Xinhua) -- A two-day conference was
launched here today by the European Commission(EC) to give a
comprehensive presentation of the measures aimed to enable Small
and Medium-sized Enterprises(SME) to participate in the European
research program.
</P>
<P>
The so-called Technology Stimulation Measures of the European
Union(EU) are designed to promote and facilitate SME participation
in EU's research and technological development(RTD) program and
are geared to SMEs with little or no research capacities of their
own and high-technology SMEs.
</P>
<P>
"SMEs can submit their projects in two stages, first an
outline, then a full proposal, and they can do this at any time
with financial aid from the Community," a EC spokesman explained.
</P>
<P>
"They can then entrust the execution of their RTD work to one
or more research organizations, while retaining ownership of the
results," he added.
</P>
<P>
About 99.8 percent of all enterprises in the EU are SMEs. They
are responsible for 66 percent of employment and 65 percent of
economic turnover in the EU.
</P>
<P>
However, SMEs have often problems to fit into the RTD program
because of their small size and limited financial resources.

<P>
HARARE, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabweans, particularly the
business community, have been urged to be vigilant when dealing
with unfamiliar people during the forthcoming group of 15
developing countries summit.
</P>
<P>
Police Deputy Commissioner Godwin Matanga said here today that
certain criminals might take advantage of such gatherings to
swindle people out of money.
</P>
<P>
''We anticipate that these con-men are likely to strike during
the summit to be held from November 3 to 5. They usually
masquerade as delegates associated with the summit and thus
swindle the people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He warned of increased police presence throughout the capital,
particularly at hotels, where ''vigilant police officers'' would
be deployed to provide security to delegates.
</P>
<P>
''There will be vigorous enforcement of all criminal laws and
statutory regulations. Crime patrols will be intensified
immediately prior to and during the summit,'' said Matanga.

<HEADLINE> Washington Post Endorses Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The Washington Post on
Wednesday endorsed U.S. President Bill Clinton for re-election
over Republican presidential nominee Robert Dole.
</P>
<P>
In an editorial, the Post said that in office Clinton "has
taken some steps and adopted stands that seem sensible and right
to us..."
</P>
<P>
"But on too many fundamental issues-- above all, by the
standard of steadfastness -- his administration has been
disappointing and deficient and sometimes simply tawdry," the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The Post said Dole, despite a third of a century in national
politics and Congress, has "little or nothing to say to the
American public."
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said both candidates "have blithely and
expediently junked many of the better elements of their records in
this 'I'll say- or-do-anything' campaign.
</P>
<P>
"As a result there are days of the week when the strongest
single argument that can be made for either candidate is that he's
not the other," the Post said. "In the end, we lean toward Mr.
Clinton."
</P>
<P>
"In sum, Mr. Clinton's shortcomings are more evident and
inescapable than they were four years ago. But somewhere in that
changeable figure, we believe, lies the capacity to do a better
job of the presidency than he has been -- and than his opponent
has given the nation any reason to believe he would be," the Post
said.
</P>
<P>
"On that uncertain basis, we choose Bill Clinton over Bob
Dole," the paper said.

<HEADLINE> New Home Sales in U.S. Down in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Sales of new homes slipped
by 0.5 percent in September but remained at a high rate, U.S.
Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said that sales of single-family homes
totaled a seasonally adjusted 816,000 annual rate, down from a
revised 820,000 in August.
</P>
<P>
But it remained the second highest rate since an 857,000 rate
in April 1986. Sales totaled 785,000 in July.
</P>
<P>
The level of new home sales in U.S. has remained above the
700,000 rate for nine consecutive months. It was the longest such
stretch since they remained above that level for 36 months between
October 1976 and September 1979.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, sales are 14.8 percent above those of the
same period last year. During all of 1995, just 667,000 new homes
were sold.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the strong sales activity, the seasonally
adjusted estimate of new homes for sale was 336,000 at the end of
September, a 5.2-month supply at the current sales rate. It was
the smallest inventory since a 334,000 backlog in November 1994.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, sales of new homes shot up by 41.4 percent, the
steepest since a 67.4 percent surge last December. Sales rose by
6.6 percent in the West but they fell by 15.6 percent in the
Midwest and 5.3 percent in the South.
</P>
<P>
Analysts have predicted for months that new home sales would
level off as costly financing drove buyers out of the market. But
the drop was not as sharp as they had expected.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages averaged 8.23 percent in
September, well above the 7.03 percent average in January.

<HEADLINE> UK Postal Workers Vote to Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The British postal workers today
voted overwhelmingly to resume industrial action against the Royal
Mail.
</P>
<P>
Over sixty percent of the 138,000 postal workers gave the
Communication Workers' Union (CWU) a decisive new mandate for
action.
</P>
<P>
Alan Johnson of CWU, said the voting was an "unquestionable
mandate" to reject Royal Mail's pay and working proposals.
</P>
<P>
Senior managers are prepared to offer more money in return for
the efficiency measures which include the introduction of
team-working in post office.
</P>
<P>
However the extra money is expected to come from cash already
earmarked for the annual wage rise which was due in pay packets
from the beginning of this month.
</P>
<P>
The offer gives postal workers a 15 percent increase in basic
pay, from 183.10 pounds (274.65 U.S dollars) to 211 pounds (320.50
U.S dollars).
</P>
<P>
The vote result raises the prospect of a three-month suspension
of the Royal Mail's letters monopoly and comes in the wake of
eight stoppages by delivery and sorting office workers which cost
an estimated 40 million pounds (60 million U.S dollars).
</P>
<P>
The British government lifted the monopoly for a month during
the summer, but have warned that more walkouts would result in a
longer suspension.
</P>
<P>
Moderate sources in the union, who are unhappy about the
further action, say they are convinced their members have voted
for more disruption.
</P>
<P>
"They would vote against the Royal Mail on any issue at the
moment," one official said.

<HEADLINE> Britain Raises Interest Rates to 6.0 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Britain raised its interest
rates surprisingly Wednesday to 6.0 percent from 5.75 percent, the
first rate rise in nearly two years, the Bank of England announced
today.
</P>
<P>
The move followed this morning's monthly monetary meeting
between Chancellor Kenneth Clarke and Bank of England Governor
Eddie George, and caught the financial markets off-guard.
</P>
<P>
Clarke had recently been resisting pressure from the Bank of
England for a rate rise, fearing that raising rates so close to a
general election to be held next May could undermine the
popularity of the Conservative Party which lags far behind the
Labor Party in opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
Explaining today's decision, Clarke said that he was determined
to keep a firm grip on inflation.
</P>
<P>
"The economy is performing exceptionally well," he said.
"However, the strength of activity indicates that a rise in rates
is desirable if we are to deliver our inflation target of 0.25
percent or less in the medium term."
</P>
<P>
"Experience has shown that by increasing rates early, as I did
in 1994 and I am doing today, possible inflation can be nipped in
the bud," Clarke added.
</P>
<P>
George welcomed the decision, saying that it was a pre-emptive
move designed to choke off any inflationary pressures before they
took hold.
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks all raised their base lending rates but
home-owners are unlikely to see any change in the cost of home
loans as major mortgage lenders said they had no immediate plans
to raise their mortgage rates.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Uprooting Racism Has a Long Way to Go </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The international
community still has a long way to go to eliminate contemporary
forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related
intolerance, according to the latest report for the U.N. General
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The report prepared by Maurice Glele-Ahanhanzo, special
rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, examined incidents
of racism against Blacks, Arabs and Muslims, xenophobia,
negrophobia, anti-Semitism and related intolerance, as well as
governmental measures to overcome them.
</P>
<P>
The report, transmitted to the General Assembly by the U.N.
Secretary General, noted that the forms of and manifestations of
racism and racial discrimination are of a recurrent nature, and
they are given particular intensity by the worldwide immigration
crisis, renewed denials of the existence of the Nazi holocaust,
and profanations and arson in places of worship and cemeteries.
</P>
<P>
The world is now faced with problems in regulating migratory
flows from the poorest regions to the most prosperous, as well as
with the settlement of immigrant populations.
</P>
<P>
"The problem is a worldwide one: in Africa, America, Asia,
Europe or the Pacific, men and women who, looking for a better
life, have set out in search of a place in the global village are
impeded by discriminatory barriers," the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Their fundamental rights, such as the right to freedom of
movement, the right to leave any country, the right to marry and
to choose a spouse are increasingly subject to regulations which
refer directly or indirectly to their racial identity and national
or ethnic origin, or to preference for nations," the report said.
</P>
<P>
"All over the world, immigrants have become easy scapegoats and
sacrificial victims of the economic crisis. Described as illegal
immigrants or seen as responsible for all the problems of the
societies in which they live (crime, unemployment, social security
deficits), such people have an increasingly precarious existence
whether they have entered a country legally or illegally," the
report added.
</P>
<P>
In Asia, intraregional migration creates tension between
countries of emigration and host countries, because of the way in
which the citizens of the former are treated. In Japan, extreme
right-ring groups have written xenophobic slogans on signs in
public gardens frequented by foreigners. Certain countries claim
that the arrival of immigrants is a threat to national security.
</P>
<P>
The same stringent attitude to immigration is seen in Europe,
where most member states of the European Union have adopted
tougher legislation. France has a particular strict policy as a
commission of the French National Assembly proposed a series of
measures to improve control over immigration by non-Europeans.
Many observers consider that these measures contravene human
rights.
</P>
<P>
The situation of migrants in the United States also merits
consideration by the General Assembly since there has been a
"mobilization against foreigners unprecedented since Second World
War," particularly in California, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In Israel, the integration of the Falashas (Ethiopian Jews) who
arrived in the mid-1980s is not without problems. On last January
28, 10,000 Ethiopian immigrants held a violent demonstration in
Tel Aviv against the "racism and racial discrimination" in various
fields, including education, housing and medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
In South Africa, some 10 million immigrants have settled
illegally. As elsewhere, the foreigners are accused of everything
that goes wrong, particularly the high rate of crime in certain
outlying districts of Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
The report also noted that racist horror and terror become
commonplace, particularly in France and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The school of thought which denies the holocaust, that is,
essentially negates the historicity of the gas chambers and the
genocide of the Jews, has recently resurfaced in France.
</P>
<P>
In the south of the United States, an unprecedented wave of
arson of churches and parishes belonging to the African-American
community is sowing fear of a resurgence of anti-Black racism in
the country. In all, 34 churches have been destroyed. These
incidents took place in a general climate of growing tension
between American racial communities.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a growing trend has been observed among racist
organizations to use electronic mail or the Internet to spread
racist or xenophobic propaganda.
</P>
<P>
The international community cannot remain indifferent to the
acts above. The special rapporteur recommends to the General
Assembly that it should convene without further delay a world
conference on racism, racial discrimination and xenophobia and
include the question of immigration and xenophobia in the agenda,
or explore the possibility of holding another conference on this
theme.

LONDON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The British government announced
here today that it had pledged two million U.S. dollars of aid to
the Palestinian National Authority to help meet its budgetary
deficit.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Overseas Development Administration (ODA) said in a

<P>
The statement also quoted Overseas Development Minister
Baroness Chalker as reaffirming Britain's support for the Middle
East peace process and promising to continue providing development
assistance to the Palestinians.

The amount pledged by Britain is well below the five million

<HEADLINE> Israel Expects Russian Role on Talks with Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli officials are
expecting Russian Foreign Minister Yevgency Primakov, currently
on a Middle East tour, to play a role in Israel-Syria relations,
Israel Radio reported this evening.
</P>
<P>
Primakov, scheduled to arrived in Israel Thursday, has already
held talks with leaders in Syria, Lebanon and Egypt, and will
also visit Jordan and the Palestinian self-ruled areas this week.
</P>
<P>
The radio reported that Israeli officials hope Primakov could
clarify Syria's stand on peace negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Eitan Ben-Tsur, director-general of the
Israeli foreign ministry, and Alexander Bovin, Russian Ambassador
 to Israel, as saying that Primakov's good ties in the Arab
world will add credibility to any information he has.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured the strategic Golan Heights from Syria during
the Six Day War in 1967, and the renewal of Jewish settlements on
the heights began immediately after the war.
</P>
<P>
At previous peace negotiations, Syria demanded a total Israeli
withdrawal from the Golan Heights, but Binyamin Netanyahu's
government rejected the idea, arguing that talks should be held
without pre-conditions.
</P>
<P>
In Cairo today, Primakov refused to elaborate reports that he
came to the Middle East armed with initiatives to help put the
Israeli-Syrian peace negotiations back on track.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister is in the Middle East to seek a more
active Russian role in the U.S.-dominated Arab-Israeli peace
process. He has expressed his belief that the stalled
Arab-Israeli peace talks should resume on the basis of the
land-for-peace formula adopted at the 1991 Madrid peace
conference.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Issues Arrest Warrants Against Turks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus police have issued
arrest warrants against five persons in connection with the
killing of an unarmed Greek Cypriot in August by Turkish troops
during demonstrations in the U.N.-controlled buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
Announcing this at a press conference here today, Attorney
General Alecos Markides said the warrants will be communicated
to Interpol asking the international police force to help in the
arrest of the five suspects.
</P>
<P>
All five are said to be involved in the murder of Solomos
Solomou, shot and killed on August 14 when climbing a flagpole
to lower the Turkish flag.
</P>
<P>
"The arrest warrants were issued in connection with the
pre-meditated murder of Solomos Solomou. There are other
suspects but no available evidence about their identity,"
Markides said.
</P>
<P>
The five were identified as: Kenan Akin, self-styled minister
at the Turkish Cypriot regime in northern Cyprus; Erdal Emanet,
commander of the security forces in the north; Mehmet Karli,
commander of the 29th division of the Turkish army; Hasan
Kontaxi, former commander of the Turkish troops in Cyprus; and
Attila Sab, chief of police of the Turkish Cypriot regime.
</P>
<P>
"The portraits of all five suspects will be sent to
Interpol. There is reasonable suspicion that they are involved
in Solomou's murder," Markides said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the case of a second Greek Cypriot, Tasos Isaac,
who was killed on August 11, during demonstrations in the buffer
zone, Markides said evidence has surfaced in the past few days
which may lead to the issue of arrest warrants of murder
suspects.
</P>
<P>
"There are nine suspects in this murder case," he added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey sent troops to
take control of the northern third of the island following an
Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
Since June this year, four Greek Cypriots were killed along
the 180-kilometer-long buffer zone and a Turkish soldier was
also found murdered in his observation post.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Parliament Passes 1997 Budget After Stormy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Knesset (Parliament)
today passed the 1997 budget plan after intensive
behind-the-scene contacts and stormy debates.
</P>
<P>
The budget plan was passed in a vote of 59 in favor, 52
against and five abstentions.
</P>
<P>
The vote was delayed to the evening as Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu and his senior aides devoted the whole afternoon to
persuading his reluctant coalition partners to refrain from
vetoing the budget plan.
</P>
<P>
According to the budget plan, which will stand at 190.8
billion shekels (63.6 billion U.S. dollars), the government will
cut 4.9 billion shekels (1.6 billion dollars) mainly in public
expenditure.
</P>
<P>
State tax-revenue will total 114.7 billion shekels (38.2
billion dollars), a 6 percent increase over the 1996 figure. On
the expenditure front, social services will receive 76.5 billion
shekels (25.5 billion dollars), or 22 percent of the gross
domestic product.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that the cabinet agreed to increase 1
billion shekels (330 million dollars) in defense budget on the
assessment of increasing war possibility with its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Since the formation of the Likud government in June, tension
has appeared in Israel's relations with all its Arab neighbors,
especially Syria which was believed by Israeli experts to be
planning a military attack.
</P>
<P>
Yisrael Ba'aliya, a Russian immigrant party, strongly opposed
the plan because the government failed to increase aid to provide
more housing for immigrants. Five of its seven members abstained
from voting.
</P>
<P>
Another coalition partner, the Gesher Party led by Foreign
Minister David Levy that has five Knesset seats, also expressed
reservations about the plan, rejecting any cut in social welfare
spending. The party only supported the plan after Netanyahu sent
a letter to Levy, agreeing to discuss several clauses that it
disagreed with.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu reportedly also sent such letters to other two
coalition partners, the National Religious Party and Shas Party,
to ensure their support.
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition parties criticized the
behind-the-scene deals made by the Likud Party, saying such
agreement should be publicized 24 hours before the vote.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Dan Meridor argued the budget cut was
necessary in order to help the Israeli economy grow. He said
that, despite the past six-year "impressive growth," the Israeli
economy faced a number of serious problems, from a slowdown in
growth to a balance of payments deficit that is expected to climb
to over 5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meridor claimed that the budget cut would help increase
Israel's economic growth rate to 5-6 percent from the current 4
percent.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak: Russia Should Coordinate with U.S. on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
said today that Russia, in coordination with the United States,
can play a role in the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Moscow can contribute a lot by supporting the pursuance of the
process, but Washington still undertakes a pivotal role, Mubarak
made the statements following his meeting in the Egyptian resort
of Sharm el-Sheikh tonight with Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov and his accompanying delegation.
</P>
<P>
Russia and the United States co-sponsored the October 1991
Madrid peace conference, which formulated the principle of "land
for peace" as the cornerstone for ensuing peace talks on various
tracks. But Russia's role has shrunk considerably in recent years.
</P>
<P>
In reply to whether Primakov has come up with a definite
Russian initiative, Mubarak said they exchanged views to see what
Russia can do to revive the peace process and ensure the concluded
agreements are respected.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said Primakov will head for Israel tomorrow to sound
the other side out about the story.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said Russia and Egypt hold identical views upon a
number of topics which they dealt in depth during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Russia believes in the necessity of continuing the peace
process on the basis of agreed principles and signed agreements
and Russia does not believe in starting all over again from zero
point, he added.
</P>
<P>
"If one party wanted to begin again from square one, the
process would be stalled with the parties concerned becoming
distanced from one another and the possibility for violence
getting stronger," Primakov warned.
</P>
<P>
At noon, Primakov also met with his Egyptian counterpart Amr
Moussa in Cairo following his arrival from Lebanon on the third
leg of his Mideast tour, which was designed to reactivate the
peace process and enhance trade ties.
</P>
<P>
Primakov's Mideast tour, which has already taken him to Syria
and Lebanon, also includes Israel, Palestinian self-rule areas
and Jordan.

<HEADLINE> France Regrets Lack of Global Political Approach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 30 (Xinhua) -- France today regretted the lack
of "a global political approach" by the international community
to solve the grave humanitarian situation in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
President Jacques Chirac today again urged the "rapid"
holding of an international conference on the situation in
Africa's Great Lakes region to stop "the unacceptable misery" of
hundreds of thousands of refugees in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"The ad hoc diplomatic efforts consented up to now have not
led to anything because they seek to resolve the problems
separately, which are actually linked with each other and call for
a global political approach,"said French foreign ministry
spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
President Chirac today also proposed a five-point solution for
the crisis in Zaire, Rwanda and Burundi: solution of the refugee
problem, trial of those responsible for the 1993-1994 genocide in
Rwanda and massacre in Burundi, the re-organization of the
governments of Rwanda and Burundi, the guarantee of the safety of
minority tribes, and international aid to the region.
</P>
<P>
"The degradation of the situation and the unacceptable misery
which are developing oblige the putting into work rapidly of an
international conference under the United Nations and the
Organization of African Unity," said Chirac at a meeting of
government ministers this morning.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, exchange of heavy artilleries was reported today
along the Zairean-Rwandan border, while Rwanda for the first
admitted that it is engaging in the fighting in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan Vice President and Defense Minister Paul Kagame said in
Kigali today that Rwadan army "retorted" attacks by Zairean army
Monday evening with artillery, and that the shooting "will
re-start if necessary."
</P>
<P>
"If you slap me in the face, I will hit back. Maybe not in the
face, but surely I will give a blow," said Kagame, the head of
the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Army which conquered Rwanda from
Uganda in 1994.
</P>
<P>
At least 500,000 Hutu refugees have been forced out of their
camps in the past 10 days by violences in Zaire's Kivu region,
where the government force and the Tutsi Banyamulenge militias,
who are supported by Rwandan army, have been fighting for more
than two months.

from the African continent," the report quoted Rawlings as

What is even more worrisome is that there has long been serious
imbalance in the composition of the council. Though the developing
countries make up more than two thirds of the U.N. members, the
reality is far from adequately reflected by their representation
in the council, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The reform of the council must focus on redressing imbalanced
regional representation, particularly serious inadequacy in the
developing countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It must in no way further aggravate such imbalance. Without
attaining this objective, the enlargement of the council cannot be
regarded as reform in a real sense, but rather a failure of the
reform," he said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized, "The council is not a club of the rich, still
less a board of directors. Increasing the membership of the
council cannot and should not solely depend on a country's
financial contributions to the U.N."
</P>
<P>
"What is more important is whether it has a correct
understanding of war and peace both from historical and current
perspectives, and whether it is a positive factor for promoting
international peace and security," he said.
</P>
<P>
Another important aspect of the council's reform is the
improvement of its working methods, he said. This is aimed at,
first, enhancing its effectiveness so that it can better fulfill
its responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and
security, and second, increasing the transparency of its work and
strengthening the understanding of and participation in its work
by the general membership to show that it truly acts on behalf of
member states, he said.

<HEADLINE> US Fed Says Economy Advancing at Moderate Pace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy continues
to slow and the pace of growth remains moderate with few signs of
significant price increases, the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed)
reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Moderate expansion of business activity characterizes the
economy in most Federal Reserve districts, but on balance the pace
of growth reportedly has slowed somewhat," according to a survey
of regional business conditions by the Fed's 12 district banks.
</P>
<P>
The Fed survey said that consumer spending in recent weeks was
"best described as moderate. There are some signs of strength, but
no areas where sales are booming."
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector is "largely stable to stronger" and
variations occurred in the construction industry, which was
reported to be strong in several districts but slackening in a
few.
</P>
<P>
While the survey found few indications of price increases, it
revealed upward pressure on wages due to tight labor markets in
some occupations.
</P>
<P>
It also reported that "upward pressure on wages continues to
spread geographically and to grow in terms of affected occupations
and ranges of skill levels."
</P>
<P>
But the survey said that "reports of price increases for raw
materials, goods and services remain limited."
</P>
<P>
The survey was based on information collected through October
21 and will be used by the U.S. Fed for deciding the monetary
policy when its policy-makers meet on November 13.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Commerce Department also reported earlier today that
economic growth had slowed to a 2.2 percent annual rate during the
July-September quarter from a robust 4.7 percent rate in the
previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts now believe the U.S. Fed will keep the interest
rates steady as the economy already has slowed on its own and
there are few signs of inflation.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Fed has been keeping interest rates stable since last
January, when it lowered the federal funds rate to 5.25 percent
from 5.5 percent after the economy showed signs of stagnation.

<HEADLINE> More Survivors Believed Under Collapsed Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-eight persons have been
killed in a 12-story building collapse in Cairo which took place
76 hours ago, while medical authorities said expectations for
more survivors under the rubble are still high.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the medical team looking after the survivors
said expectations are high that there are still some survivors
buried under the heap of concrete chunks and steel bars.
</P>
<P>
About 100 are still missing and feared dead following a
three-day intense rescue operation, which was launched minutes
after the collapse of the apartment building in Heliopolis in the
northeast of the Egyptian capital Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
So far, 36 persons have been dug out from the mountain of
concrete and steel, while 21 injured were sent to hospital since
the ill-fated building caved in like the folds of an accordion on
its residents.
</P>
<P>
Governor of Cairo Omar Abdel Akher told reporters that a
Japanese rescue team equipped with high-tech detectors is due to
arrive here tonight to probe for possibility of any survival.
</P>
<P>
Preparations to clear the rubble are underway, said the
governor.
</P>
<P>
Earth movers gradually removed the rubble that had been
searched while hundreds of rescuers moved on to pick through
pieces of brick, carpets and furniture with their hands for signs
of life.
</P>
<P>
The hundreds of rescuers, working against the time day and
night, at dawn pulled out a 19-year-old Egyptian girl and her
17-year-old American friend, both suffering abrasions.
</P>
<P>
Noha Mohammed Fawzi, now in hospital, said she and her friend
cited Koran and told themselves the story of a man found alive
after four days from under a collapsed building in the October
1992 earthquake in Cairo during their 35-hour ordeal in the dark.
</P>
<P>
Ambulances and a heavy crane were parked at the base of the
apartment block, transformed into a burial ground of personal
belongings like TV sets, books and handbags.
</P>
<P>
The authorities here said the 25-year-old building had been
illegally heightened and the owner is being questioned, but some
engineers suspected that the tragedy was caused by amendments to
the basic columns of the building in recent renovation work.

JOHANNESBURG, October 30 (Xinhua) -- One of the notorious

sentenced to two life sentences plus 212 years in imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
The South African Supreme Court based in Pretoria ruled the

De Kock, a commander of the security police of the apartheid

Justice Willem Van Der Merwe said De Kock had applied for
amnesty from the Truth and Reconciliation Committee, and his

During his long trial, De Kock made startling revelations of
involvement of the former apartheid regimes in a global campaign

<HEADLINE> Tunisian, Libyan Leaders Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Tunisian President Zine
al-Abidine Ben Ali and visiting Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi
today discussed ways to boost cooperation between their countries.
</P>
<P>
The Tunisian Press Agency reported that the talks, the second
round of such since Gaddafi arrived here Monday, mainly focused
on bilateral cooperation in economic, industrial and commercial
fields.
</P>
<P>
Ben Ali reiterated the importance of intensifying and
diversifying bilateral cooperation in public and private
enterprises, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also reaffirmed their adherence to the Arab
Moghreb Union, which they described as a "historic achievement
and a strategic option" in the light of the changes in
international relations.
</P>
<P>
The union was created in February, 1989, in Marrakesh of
Morocco, as a sort of mini common market, which groups Morocco,
Algeria, Tunis, Libya and Mauritius.
</P>
<P>
Ben Ali and Gaddafi also underscored the necessity of
enhancing Arab solidarity to face the serious challenges
confronting the Arab nations.
</P>
<P>
Ben Ali renewed Tunisia's solidarity with Libya and its
earnest endeavors to help alleviate the sufferings of the Libyan
people caused by a U.N. embargo for its failure to hand over two
Libyans reportedly involved in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight
103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.

<HEADLINE> Russian FM Urges Israel to Honor Pledges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said here today that principal efforts should be
directed at encouraging Israel to honor its pledges.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a lecture today on Russia's foreign policy at Al
Ahram Political and Strategic Studies Center, the visiting
foreign minister said Russia has been keen on the peace process
not sliding back to square one as the incumbent Israeli
government wishes.
</P>
<P>
The Likud government has backtracked the policies of the
former Labor government, said Primakov
</P>
<P>
He said the statements Israel made on implementing the
agreements are "mere words devoid of practicality."
</P>
<P>
The top Russian diplomat asserted the exigency of Israel's
abidance by the Madrid and Oslo agreements, adding that Russia
and France had issued a joint call upon Israel to adhere to the
signed agreements and principles at the G-7 summit in Lyone.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the active European role in the region proves that
"we are living in a multi-polar world," said the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Primakov confirmed that he is carrying new ideas to push
forward the peace process, but he said he would disclose them
until the end of his Middle East tour.
</P>
<P>
On choice of a U.N. secretary general, Primakov said Russia is
backing Boutros Boutros Ghali's re-election for the post despite
the U.S. opposition.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Primakov met with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and his Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa following his
arrival from Lebanon on the third leg of his Mideast tour, which
was designed to reactivate the peace process and enhance trade
ties.
</P>
<P>
Primakov's Mideast tour, which has already taken him to Syria
and Lebanon, also includes Israel, Palestinian self-rule areas
and Jordan.

<HEADLINE> Senior Party Leader Meets Sierra Leone Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, a Standing Committee
member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party
Central Committee, met in Beijing this afternoon with a delegation
of the Sierra Leone People's Party, led by its deputy head and
vice-president of Sierra Leone, Albert Demby.
</P>
<P>
The delegation is the first sent to China by Sierra Leone's
People's Party.
</P>
<P>
Extending a warm welcome, Qiao said the fact that the People's
Party sent a senior delegation to China and sought to develop
relations with the CPC, shortly after it took power again,
demonstrates the great importance the party attaches to bilateral
ties.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said that the CPC is willing to develop ties with the
Sierra Leone People's Party on the basis of the four principles of
independence, equality, mutual respect, and non-interference in
each other's internal affairs, for handling party-to-party
relations.
</P>
<P>
Qiao, noting that both China and Sierra Leone face the task of
developing the economy and improving people's lives, said the two
countries can compare notes and learn from each other in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the conviction that the delegation's visit will
promote mutual understanding between the two parties, and the
friendship and co-operation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Voicing appreciation for China's help to his country over the
years, Demby said that his people admire China's economic
achievements and its role in the world, along with a strong
interest in learning about its experience in development.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that Sierra Leone adheres to the "one China" policy
and hopes to see an early reunification of the motherland by the
Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The delegation arrived here on October 29 at the invitation of
the International Department of the CPC Central Committee, and is
scheduled to visit Tianjin, Chengdu and Guilin.

<HEADLINE> China To Increase Funds For Poor Counties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, October 31 (Xinhua) -- China has decided to raise its
aid-to-the-poor funds from 5.5 billion yuan (688 million
U.S. dollars) in 1996 to 8.5 billion yuan (106 million dollars)
next year in an effort to improve its poverty relief.
</P>
<P>
Chen Junsheng, a state councillor and head of State Council's
Leading Group in Charge of Aid-to-the-Poor Projects, said here
today that aid-to-the-poor projects provided by the Agricultural
Development Bank of China, which was set up in 1994 to lend money
to agricultural projects, are expected to reach 33 billion yuan by
the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has provided 10.8 billion yuan in funds
for 592 poor counties, 51 percent of which is credit provided by
the Agricultural Development Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
Chen urged agricultural development banks and local government
units to make still better use of the funds and to improve
controls, and asked them to focus on local resources development
and market-oriented commodity production with the use of science
and technology.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the credit must be repaid with interest, so the
projects should be those that can yield a profit.
</P>
<P>
China drafted a plan in 1994 for meeting the needs of 80
million poor people's for adequate food and clothing by the end of
this century. By 1995, the poor population in the country had
dropped to 65 million.
</P>
<P>
The aid-to-the-poor includes bank credits, funds, and relief
funds in exchange for work.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that basic solution to the problem of food and
clothing for the poor population by the turn of the century is
still an arduous and heavy task, and one that asks poor farmers to
be working hard and self-reliantly, but one that requires more
development funds.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Venture to Produce World's First "Magic" Telephones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's Copytele
Electronics Company, a Sino-U.S. joint venture, will soon start
producing the Magicom 2000 telephone, which represents a new
generation of office automation equipment.
</P>
<P>
Denis A. Krusos, chairman of the board of U.S. Copytele, said
at a news conference here today that the joint venture of the
U.S. Copytele Company, Shanghai Electronic Component Corp., and
Shanghai Foreign Economic Cooperation and Trade Investment
Company, will be the first in the world to produce such telephones
that print their own message and allow callers to see each other.
</P>
<P>
First phase investment in the venture is seven million
U.S. dollars, with the U.S. side holding 55 percent, and the
Chinese side 45 percent, of the shares.
</P>
<P>
The venture will have an annual production capacity of 700,000
sets of Magicom 2000 telephones. Over 80 percent of the products
will be sold abroad, Krusos said.
</P>
<P>
Krusos said Shanghai will be his company's top production
center in the future, because of its unique economic and
geographical position in China, and because of China's market
potentials.
</P>
<P>
The new phone can connect with computers, printers, fax
machines, pagers and mobile phones.

<HEADLINE> Ericsson To Introduce DCS 1800 To China Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Sweden's Ericsson, one of the
world's leading suppliers of telecommunications systems, today
began providing its 1800 digital communications system (DCS) for
the China market, to help meet the country's growing demand for
mobile telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
The DCS 1800 is an enhanced GSM 900 system, operating in the
1,800 megahertz range, which is expected to provide larger mobile
network capacity, according to Jan Malm, vice-president of
Ericsson China.
</P>
<P>
The annual growth rate of mobile phone users in China is
estimated to rise from the current one percent to three percent by
the turn of the century, indicating that the present GSM 900
system will not comply with the growing demand in the future. The
number of mobile phone users is expected to increase from seven
million this year to 25 million by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Ericsson is the first overseas company to introduce the DCS
1800 system to China, with a full range of services, such as
switching, base station controllers, and base stations.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 percent of the world's mobile phone users are
hooked up to Ericsson's systems. China has become Ericsson's
second largest market.
</P>
<P>
In China, 15 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions
are now using Ericsson's global system of mobile communication
(GSM system), and nine more using its total access cellular system
(TACS). In the near future, its four other provinces and
municipalities will have Ericsson's GSM systems.
</P>
<P>
Ericsson has invested more than 100 million US dollars in
China, with 13 representative offices and nine joint ventures
operating nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scholars And Traditional Handicraft Preservation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zhu Dazhen, a standing council member of the China Society of
Mechanics History, told Xinhua today that in recent years, with
the improving technology, many traditional tools have been
discarded, and craftsmen possessing unique skills have passed
away, resulting in the near-extinction of many unique traditions.
</P>
<P>
"The conservation of traditional handicrafts does not mean
continuing to use traditional ways, but the preservation of
handicrafts as a cultural heritage," Zhu explains.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that eight major traditional trades -- paper
making, printing, ceramics, textiles, powder, metal crafts,
foodstuff, and Chinese medicine -- have developed 219 kinds of
handicrafts, including the one that provided cloisonne.
</P>
<P>
But the traditional techniques, handed down from masters to
apprentices across the centuries, are hard to preserve because of
the lack of a systematic method for retaining them, and because
few young people are interested in them, Zhu noted.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, 41 out of 57 local craftsmen who rose to the status
of Master Craftsman in the early 1950's have passed away, and
another ten have lost the ability to work.
</P>
<P>
Some employees from the Beijing Arts and Crafts Company have
tried to collect 60 sheets of written materials and 110 hours of
tape recordings on master craftsmen, but they had to stop because
of a lack of funds, and, "Even the collected data are difficult to
keep," Zhu says.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, who is also an associate research fellow at the
prestigious National Museum of Chinese History, took part in a
project to copy embroidery excavated from tombs in northwest
China's Qinghai province. Working in cooperation with local
craftsmen, he used traditional tools and dye in the project and
won an award for new technology for conservation of cultural
relics, which was sponsored by the State Bureau of Cultural Relics
earlier this year.

<P>
BEIJING, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng met with 360
model workers from the country's light industrial sector here
today and encouraged them to produce more and better light
industrial goods and improve after-sale services.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that light industry will become the focus of new
growth in China's economy in the future and is playing an
important role in national economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
Light industry now accounts for about one-third of national
industrial output value, one-third of the country's exports, and
one-third of the profits and taxes paid by the entire industry
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Li urged the light industry sector to improve its management
and push forward technical progress through increased reforms and
hard work to improve efficiency.
</P>
<P>
China is a socialist country and the working class should be
masters in their enterprises, Li said, expressing the hope that
the model workers will play a pioneering role in industrial
development.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Old Coalition Partners Sign New Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto and his two partners in the outgoing coalition
government signed an agreement today which effectively allows
Hashimoto's Liberal Democratic Party to form a new minority
government.
</P>
<P>
Social Democratic Party (SDP) leader Takoko Doi and New Party
Sakigake upper-house leader Akiko Domoto refused to join a new
coalition government, but agreed to form a loose alliance and
announced a package of policy goals.
</P>
<P>
The three parties signed documents calling for promotion of
administrative and fiscal reforms, and overhaul of the electoral
system, Kyodo News Service said.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to set up a decision-making council made up of
representatives of the three parties.
</P>
<P>
But they failed to agree on eight policy issues, including a
SDP-proposed ban on political donations by companies and groups,
the launching of talks on the reduction in the defense budget.
</P>
<P>
The LDP, SDP and Sakigake had been in coalition since June
1994, first under the SDP's Tomiichi Murayama and then under
the LDP's Hashimoto since January.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto had been trying to persuade the two junior partners
to renew the coalition after failing to win an outright majority
in general elections earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto's LDP won only 239 seats in the important lower
house, 12 short of a majority.
</P>
<P>
But the SDP and Sakigake, who suffered heavy losses in the
election, refused to renew the coalition, fearing they would become
irrelevant partners in the government.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, their decision to agree to an informal alliance
by setting up policy consultation groups outside the cabinet means
that Hashimoto is likely to be reelected as prime minister when
the new parliament opens on November 7.
</P>
<P>
Sakigake, which now has only two seats in the lower house, has
decided to vote for Hashimoto in the prime ministerial election,
but the SDP, which has 15 seats, has not yet made a decision.

BEIJING, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun
stressed here today the importance of the work for agricultural
standardization at a meeting with delegates to a national
conference on agricultural standardization.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese
Communist Party Central Committee, called for improving the
country's agricultural standardization and management work, and
cited the work as part of the country's agricultural modernization.
</P>
<P>
He noted that agricultural modernization work is characterized
primarily by commercialization, standardization, and
intensification of agricultural work, and the ultimate purpose is,
briefly, to increase profits.
</P>
<P>
With the gradual improvement of the country's socialist market
economy, agricultural standardization and management are sure to
play a greater role because they can help improve the
competitiveness of Chinese agricultural products on the global
market, Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Wants Peaceful Solution to Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan today voiced its
hope again that the warring factions in Afghanistan will stop
fighting and hold negotiations to find a peaceful solution to the
problem.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan would continue to support U.N. efforts for peace and
reconciliation in Afghanistan, a Foreign Office spokesman told a
weekly briefing here.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistani Interior Minister Nasirullah Babar's shuttle
diplomacy made it possible for the Taliban and Northern Afghan
warlord Rashid Dostum to sit together for discussions on a
ceasefire agreement.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question as to if Babar would continue shuttle
diplomacy in Afghanistan, he said, "Pakistan will do whatever
possible to promote reconciliation in Afghanistan."
</P>
<P>
Asked about the peace efforts of UN Special envoy to
Afghanistan Norbert Holl, the spokesman said Holl was shuttling
between Mazar-i-Sharif and Kandahar to secure a ceasefire between
General Dostum and the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the U.N. efforts will bear fruit and
the two warring factions will agree to a ceasefire to end the
bloodshed in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the Ad Hoc committee of the
Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) also held a working
meeting with Mulla Muhammad Ali Muhammadi, a representative of the
newly formed Taliban government in Afghanistan, and noted a
request by the Taliban for recognition of the new government.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban representative, he said, informed the meeting that
the Taliban control two-thirds of the country's territory.
</P>
<P>
A recent meeting of OIC Foreign Ministers discussed the
question of Afghanistan's representation in the OIC and decided to
keep Afghanistan's seat vacant in the organization, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the decision had also been confirmed by the OIC Ad Hoc
Committee comprising Guinea, Turkey and Iran.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the United Nations would host an
international conference on Afghanistan to try to find out a
solution to the Afghan problem.
</P>
<P>
The move, he said, is still in its early stages and nothing
could be said as to who will be invited and when and where the
meeting will be held.
</P>
<P>
But he added, "Something more on the subject could be said by
next week."

<HEADLINE> Returns To Woolgrowers Fall Due To High Stocks: IWS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Financial returns to wool
growers fell in 1995-96 due to poor economic conditions, low
consumer confidence and high levels of pipeline stocks, the
International Wool Secretariat (IWS) said in its annual report
issued today.
</P>
<P>
IWS managing director Adrian Kloeden said: "The wool growers
who fund the IWS technical and promotional activities can see we
are serious about delivering results in clear measurable terms."
</P>
<P>
"But during the year, poor economic conditions and low consumer
confidence combined with high levels of pipeline stocks to reduce
returns back to growers".
</P>
<P>
In western Europe, low consumer confidence due to increasing
unemployment and low growth in personal consumption had a negative
impact on textile and wool apparel consumption, while in the
Asia-Pacific region, Japan underwent a third consecutive year of
growth below one percent.
</P>
<P>
In view of this situation, the Australian Government is looking
at boosting the incomes of wool growers by giving them early
access to between 600 million and 900 million Australian dollars
(480 to 720 million US dollars) tied up in the wool stockpile.
</P>
<P>
The Minister for Primary Industries, John Anderson said
yesterday that wool growers needed help after more than six years
of depressed prices which had caused "immense damage" to growers
and rural communities.
</P>
<P>
A joint government-industry working group is looking at ways of
allowing growers to sell their accrued entitlement in the wool
stockpile, which is still close to 200 million bales, and an
official report is expected to be submitted by the end of the
year, according to the minister.

<HEADLINE> Ramos: Shanty Demolition Not Normal Policy for Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
said here today that demolition of squatter shanties is not "the
normal policy" of the government, but when it is carried out it is
for the benefit of the greater majority of the Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
"Where negotiations and dialogue fail and demolition is
necessary for the common good, especially in danger zones and in
sites of urgent government infrastructure projects, the demolition
will take place only as provided by law," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government is reportedly demolishing shanties
along main streets and rivers in preparation for the coming Fourth
Informal Leadership Conference of the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum.
</P>
<P>
However, the demolition gave rise to widespread opposition
among the poor who even fought with government workers pulling
down their houses.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the demolition of squatters' dwellings is not the
normal policy of the government in dealing with the poor because
it always brings sufferings to these people, but the actions are
all guided by law.
</P>
<P>
"There will no demolition without proper notice, serious
consultations and an adequate relocation site as mandated by the
law," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ramos warned squatter families against "squatter
syndicates and professional squatters," noting the government is
against not the poor but those who take advantage of the poor and
those who use the poor for their own selfish needs.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said his administration is "right on target" in its bid
to provide some 1.2 million decent, low-cost homes to poor
families by the end of his term in 1998.
</P>
<P>
But analysts noted that the problem is that the cheap homes
President Ramos referred to are still very expensive for the poor.

<HEADLINE> WFP Plans Emergency Relief Stockpile in Eastern Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The UN World Food Program (WFP)
is to set up an emergency relief stockpile in the eastern Zairean
border town of Goma to aid more than 700,000 refugees fleeing
ethnic conflict in the region.
</P>
<P>
The WFP said it would begin airlifts to build the relief
stockpile "as soon as the Zairean authorities give us the green
light, which we hope will be within the day".
</P>
<P>
The first flight will deliver primarily emergency food rations
from neighbouring Uganda. Additional flights will also ferry
supplies for other international relief agencies.
</P>
<P>
Current food needs in Goma are estimated at 300 tonnes per
day but the WFP said its foodstocks would run out next week after
another planned distribution of food to some 727,000 refugees.
</P>
<P>
These refugees, mostly Rwandan Hutus, have been forced out of
their camps over the past 10 days by violence in Zaire's eastern
Kivu region, where Zairean government forces and the Tutsis
Banyamulenge rebels, allegedly backed by the Rwandan army, have
been fighting for more than two months.
</P>
<P>
The UN food agency said that the scope of its airlift would
depend on security on the ground, the availability of ground
transport and the size of airport space it could use.
</P>
<P>
It is still looking into the possibility of getting airlift and
ground support facilities from donor countries, as well as of
finding safe overland transport routes.
</P>
<P>
On October 26, the WFP suspended a planned airlift to Bukavu, a
lakeside city south of Goma across from the Rwandan border. WFP
said airlifting relief to Bukavu was still impossible due to
continued fighting and widespread looting there.
</P>
<P>
The fast-moving conflict in eastern Zaire began with a Zairean
army campaign against Tutsis but springs from deadly rivalry
between Tutsis and Hutus which killed up to one million people in
Rwanda's 1994 genocide and left Zaire hosting the Hutu refugees.
</P>
<P>
Declaring the situation in Zaire "a grave emergency", the World
Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday it has ordered the
stockpiling of medicine there to deal with potential needs.
</P>
<P>
The stockpile will include drugs to stop the spread of cholera,
meningitis, epidemic dysentery and malaria. The WHO is also
sending to Zaire a four-person emergency evaluation team and
establishing an emergency budget to cope with future needs.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Rises in Brazilian Plane Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, October (Xinhua) -- At least 95 people are now
believed dead after a Brazilian jetliner crashed soon after
takeoff today on a domestic flight from Sao Paulo, Brazil, the
Globo TV network quoted an airport official as saying.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 89 passengers and six crew on board the
Fokker-100 airliner owned by the TAM regional airline, dozens of
people in the densely populated residential area where the
plane crashed are believed to have been injured or killed.
</P>
<P>
Television pictures showed dozens of bodies from the plane
wreckage wrapped in black plastic bags lined up along the streets.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of firefighters and ambulance men were at the scene
trying to rescue people trapped in the rubble of the buildings.
</P>
<P>
The crash, which happened about two kilometers away from the
airport runway, is believed to be the worst air accident in the
country so far this year.
</P>
<P>
An airport official said the plane took off from Sao Paulo's
Congonhas airport 8:45 a.m. local time(1945GMT) heading for the
capital Brasilia. Two minutes later the plane crashed into an
apartment building and burst into flames.
</P>
<P>
He said there were no clues so far as to the cause of the

ISLAMABAD, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Sensitive Price
Indicator (SPI) increased by 12.01 percent for the week that ended

</P>
<P>
The week's index is also 0.40 percent higher compared to the

MANILA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- the Philippine central bank has
signed a bilateral repurchase agreement with the bank of japan,
allowing it to immediately borrow US dollars from Japan in times
of intense currency speculation.
</P>
<P>
Philippine central bank governor Gabriel Singson said that the
agreement with Japan is the sixth bilateral one entered into by
the country, bringing to 3.5 billion dollars the aggregate amount
of such agreements the Philippines has contracted.
</P>
<P>
Singson said the repurchase agreement with Japan is similar to
the agreements signed by the Philippine government with its

The Philippine central bank pledges its US Treasury notes/bills
as collateral with a proviso to buy back the said securities at a

<HEADLINE> Internal Debt Increases in Bulgaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria's internal debt soared
more than 40 percent to 489 billion leva (2 billion U.S. dollars)
in the first half of this year and is expected to reach 600
billion leva (2.5 billion dollars) by the end of the year,
newspaper reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The rise in internal debt has been caused mainly by an increase
in bad loans brought about by record high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Bad loans in the first six months of the year had risen to 260
billion leva (1.1 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian National Bank raised interest rates to prevent a
run on the country's banks after Bulgarians withdrew more than 500
million dollars worth of leva from banks in the space of a few
months.
</P>
<P>
The government plans to raise money by privatizing a number of
big state-run enterprises, a policy imposed by the International
Monetary Fund as a condition for providing fresh loans and lines
of credit to the country which is facing a severe financial and
economic crisis.

<HEADLINE> China Draws up Law on Commercial Secrets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, October 31 (Xinhua) -- China's legislature is working
on a law to protect commercial secrets, according to Prof. Zheng
Sicheng, a leading intellectual property rights expert and advisor
to the group.
</P>
<P>
The new law, based on "The Agreement on Intellectual Property
Rights Related to Trade," "will not differ much from similar laws
of most countries in terms of principles," Zheng said .
</P>
<P>
A late-comer in setting up a property rights system, China has
followed international practices, starting with a law on illegal
competition prohibiting fake products, and then moving on to the
protection of commercial secrets.
</P>
<P>
The first case filed in China on illegal competition, back in
1990, was related to counterfeit goods, while the latest dealt
with the piracy of technology.
</P>
<P>
Under the system of planned economy, inventions were regarded
as public properties, which were free to all users. With the
patent system set up in 1985, inventions were put under legal
protection. However, business secrets and inventions not covered
by patent rights remained out of the protection of law.
</P>
<P>
Existing laws on patent rights, trade marks and copyrights,
contain no clear definition of commercial secrets, according to
the legal scholar.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan-IMF Agreement to Pave Way for ESAF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The agreement reached between
Pakistan and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on standby
arrangements will serve as "a bridge to resuming the Extended
Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF)," an IMF official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
"After the reactivation of standby arrangements in November, we
expect that a satisfactory performance of the policies we are
implementing during the year 1996-97 will bring back Pakistan to
the ESAF arrangements in the next fiscal year," Antonio Furtado,
leader of a visiting IMF mission, told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and the IMF have just reached an agreement on the
reactivation of a stalled 600 million U.S. dollar loan. The
arrangements on the loan were stopped in June this year due to the
IMF's dissatisfaction over Pakistan's economic performance.
</P>
<P>
Furtado said the focus this time has been to strengthen the
budget.
</P>
<P>
"We expect that next year Pakistan would be able to go back to
the path of gradual liberalization including strong fiscal
position, reduction in budget deficit and improvement in the
domestic taxation and competitiveness of the exports."
</P>
<P>
According to the ESAF it signed with the IMF earlier, Pakistan
would get 3 billion dollars for economic structural reforms.
</P>
<P>
However, the facility was suspended last year as Pakistan was
unable to meet the ESAF conditions.
</P>
<P>
In face of economic difficulties, the Pakistani government had
to sign a standby agreement with the IMF in October last year.
</P>
<P>
Furtado noted that at the structural level, many policies
including privatization and banking reforms were being implemented
and supported by the standby agreement.
</P>
<P>
"On these policies the fund will as soon as possible go back to
supporting an early ESAF," he added.

<HEADLINE> France to Cut Foreign Aid in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 31 (Xinhua) -- France is to cut its foreign aid
by 7.8 percent to 6.7 billion francs (1.34 billion U.S. dollars)
next year as part of the government's overall austerity budget.
</P>
<P>
However, Minister of Cooperation Jacques Godfrain said that
taking inflation into account, the amount of aid would only fall
by 3.3 percent and pointed out that France was still one of the
world's largest aid donors.
</P>
<P>
He said France has had to abandon some of its support measures
for Africa due to a sharp devaluation in the African franc in 1994
and a decrease in the number of French aid experts.
</P>
<P>
France became the world's second largest contributor to the
Public Aid for Development program in 1995, ahead of Germany and
the United States, but behind Japan, Godfrain said.
</P>
<P>
"Each time the United States spends one dollar, France spends
12," he noted. French investment in sub-Saharan Africa is now 10
billion francs (2 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, as many as 1,500 French enterprises have been set
up in French-speaking African countries with 120,000 French
technicians and workers. These enterprises also support 200,000
jobs in France, according to the minister.

<HEADLINE> Environmental Protection Goals Set for Township Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 31 (xinhua) -- China has turned out a plan to
help township enterprises protect environment in the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, by the year 2000, the amount of pollutants
discharged by township enterprises will have to be no higher than
the 1995 level.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Township Enterprises Bureau, under the
Ministry of Agriculture, noted that with the rapid development of
township enterprises in the past few years, pollution problems
impair rural life and the development of township companies.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 1995, the discharge of waste water, gas
and residue by these companies reached 4.7 billion tons, 2,600
billion cubic meters and 130 million tons respectively.
</P>
<P>
To help maintain the sustainable development of the township
enterprises, and fulfil the targets set in the plan, the ministry
has worked out a series of measures to manage the companies.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the ministry has set different
pollution standards, and the cleaning measures for the major
pollution industries, such as brick, cement, coke and casting
sectors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ministry will eliminate heavy energy-consuming
equipment and technologies in the companies, while encouraging the
use of energy-saving facilities.

<HEADLINE> China to Produce Two Million Electronic Organs This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 31 (Xinhua) -- China's nine electronic organ
producers have struck the right chord with a sales boom this
year. They are expected to turn out two million electronics organs.
</P>
<P>
According to China Association of Compound Sound Systems,
electronic organ enterprises soared to 215 when an electronic
organ craze was sweeping across the country in 1986. But they
only produced around 100,000 electronic organs each year for a
certain period.
</P>
<P>
However, the choice of market washed away a large number of
poorly-managed and loss-making enterprises over the past decade,
and left only nine robust ones. They are now producing electronic
organs of high grade and in large quantities, instead of the
so-called "toy" organs.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, experts in Beijing said that the domestic
electronic organ producers must remain clear-minded, since China's
electronic organ market, especially the market of top quality
electronic organs, has been monopolized by overseas-made products,
with Japanese products calling the tune.
</P>
<P>
Chinese electronic organ producers should seize the opportunity
to produce brand-name products which have a firm foothold in both
the domestic and overseas markets, experts said.

MOGADISHU, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-seven people were
killed and 50 wounded when forces of factional leader Osman
Hassan Ali Atto captured an airstrip from militiaman of his rival
Hussein Aidid on Wednesday, hospital sources confirmed today.
</P>
<P>
They said Osman Atto's militiamen attacked Aidid's forces at
the Middle Shabelle airstrip, 50 km from Mogadishu. They seized
the airstrip in a raid involving eight "technical" battlewagons.
</P>
<P>
The dead include a well known doctor, Dr Mohamed Warsame Ali
known as Dodbode who was killed inside one of the damaged planes
on his way to Nairobi. Dr Dodbode was a senior member from the
joint health authority of Mogadishu. The wounded have been
treated in hospitals in Merca and in south Mogadishu and 20 of
them are in critical conditions.
</P>
<P>
sources from the airstrip confirmed that two planes were hit
by rounds of rpg-7. One plane was seen leaking fuel while the
other was seriously damaged in the wing.
</P>
<P>
One plane -- Blue Bird -- is owned by the air company while
the other is owned by Indian businessman Aslam Khan. Both pilots
who delivered the mild stimulant qat from Kenya and survived from
the shooting were flown back to Nairobi yesterday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 technical waggons belonging to Hussein Aidid's
faction were sent at the area. Over 300 militiamen have been seen
patrolling the street today linking Mogadishu to the airstrip to
Merca, 100 km south of the capital.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, 13 people were killed and eight others wounded
in the attack.
</P>
<P>
People of south Mogadishu are waiting for what is going to
happen next -- a retaliatory action from Hussein Aidid's side, or
a new round of confrontation between the factions in Mogadishu,
and peace is now out of the question.

<HEADLINE> Siemens Aims to Share China's Power Plant Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Siemens AG has
launched a drive to win a large slice of a major expansion program
in China's power generating industry.
</P>
<P>
Experts have predicted that China will only be able to meet 80
per cent of its equipment needs from domestic sources, paving the
way for the other 20 percent to come from overseas companies.
</P>
<P>
Siemens, already well established in China, has announced it
aims to win 20 percent of the market for the supply of generating
equipment for power plants in China from overseas companies.
</P>
<P>
The move will help Siemens' Power Generation Group (KWU), to
win one billion Deutsche Marks in sales in China by the turn of
the century.
</P>
<P>
Dietrich Stahl, vice president of Siemens China, gave details
about Siemens/KWU's great interest in developing China's power
market at a news conference in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Shortage of power supplies has restricted economic development
for many countries in Asia, while rapid economic growth in China
has led to high demand for power. This also indicates that China
has a great potential for power development, noted Stahl.
</P>
<P>
China's total installed capacity is expected to rise from the
current 200 GW to 300 GW by the year 2000, with an annual increase
during the 1996-2000 period of up to 18,000 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
And a majority of the capacity growth will be met by domestic
equipment, leaving 15 percent to 20 percent of the country's power
plant equipment market for overseas suppliers.
</P>
<P>
With extensive coal reserves, China will give priority to the
construction of coal-fueled power plants, encouraging Siemens/KWU
to increase investments in steam power plants.
</P>
<P>
So far, Siemens/KWU has been involved in the construction of
China's five coal-fueled power plants, providing a total capacity
of 5,000 megawatts of generating units. Among them, the Rizhao
Power Plant in east China's Shandong Province and Hangfeng Power
Plant in north China's Hebei Province are being constructed by
means of BOT, according to Stahl.
</P>
<P>
Along with environment protection measures, and further
utilization of natural gas and oil, China will have a growing
equipment market for its increasing gas turbine and combined-cycle
power plants, which are primarily located in southern regions in
China.
</P>
<P>
Siemens/KWU will help expand Guangzhou Pumped-Storage Power
Plant, China's largest of its kind, in south Guangdong Province,
making it one of the largest in the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Siemens/KWU will invest 100 million US dollars to
join Dongfang Electric Corporation in Southwest China's Sichuan
Province in the setting up of joint ventures, to construct power
plants and make turbines and generators, according to Stahl.
</P>

<HEADLINE> IMF Agrees to Release Delayed Loan to Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) has agreed to release the delayed loan of 160 million
US dollars to Pakistan under an agreement reached with Islamabad,
Pakistani Finance Minister Naveed Qamar said here today.
</P>
<P>
"We have reached an agreement with the IMF. They have
satisfied themselves with the authenticity of the figures and all
the issues that were outstanding, and now we are opening a new
chapter," Qamar said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a joint press conference with IMF and World Bank
officials here, the newly appointed finance minister also
announced the reactivation of the standby arrangements and the
resumption of IMF financial assistance to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
According to the standby arrangements agreed upon between the
IMF and Pakistan, the IMF was to provide a 600 million-dollar
standby loan to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
However, the IMF refused to release the second and third
tranches of the loan due to its dissatisfaction with Pakistan's
economic performance.
</P>
<P>
Qamar said the formal revival of the arrangements would begin
by the release of initial two tranches of 160 million dollars,
outstanding for the months of June and September.
</P>
<P>
The latest agreement has been based on an economic reform
package announced by the government on October 22, Qamar said,
adding that there will be no further taxation or exchange rate
measures.
</P>
<P>
The package, known as the "mini-budget," included massive
taxation measures, an 8.5 percent devaluation of the Pakistani
rupee and price hikes of petroleum and gas. The IMF asked
Pakistan to adopt the package as a precondition for getting the
delayed standby loan.
</P>
<P>
An IMF team is currently holding talks with the Pakistani
government here following the announcement of the package, which
is largely based on an IMF proposal put forward during talks with
a Pakistani delegation in Washington earlier this month on the
release of the standby loan.
</P>
<P>
Qamar hoped that the agreement would reassure the markets
regarding the sustainability of economic policies, the enhanced
external sector viability and the strength of the long-term
prospects of the economy.
</P>
<P>
IMF Director Antonio Furtardo, who is leading the IMF
negotiating team to Pakistan, World Bank Representative Sadiq
Ahmed, Governor of State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Mohammad Yaqub,
Finance Secretary Moeen Afzal were also present at the press
conference.
</P>
<P>
Furtardo said the IMF supports the Pakistani government's
reform measures and hoped they would help strengthen the economy.
</P>
<P>
In response to a volley of questions regarding the possibility
of a further devaluation of rupee, Qamar said, "Today's agreement
should put an end to the speculation as far as the government is
concerned.
</P>
<P>
"We have already devalued to the maximum possible extent and
there would no devaluation in the foreseeable future."
</P>
<P>
The speculation was being fueled by those people expecting to
lead the market, he added.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Foreign Debt Climbs to 37 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' foreign debt
increased by 91 million US dollars to 37 billion dollars as of
June this year despite the reduction of foreign borrowings by the
public sector, central bank governor Gabriel Singson said here
today.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the country's foreign debt increased to
37.869 billion dollars as of June from the end-1995 level of
37.778 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
But foreign borrowings by the country's public sector went down
by 6 percent or 1.689 billion dollars during the period, Singson
said.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the reduction does not mean the government has
slowed down on its foreign borrowings.
</P>
<P>
The government merely transferred some of its debts to the
private sector with the privatization of two big government-owned
firms -- the National Steel Corporation and the Philippine
National Bank, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The reduction was largely brought about by the privatization
of the National Steel Corporation and the Philippine National Bank
and the subsequent reclassification of their debts as private
sectors," he said.
</P>
<P>
Singson added that the weakening of the Japanese yen vis-a-vis
the dollar also contributed to the drop in government's foreign
debt because one third of the country's foreign loans are
denominated in yen.
</P>
<P>
The yen depreciated to 109.11 to the dollar in June from 102.55
in December 1995.

<HEADLINE> Gunmen Attack Liberian Presidential Palace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 31 (Xinhua)- - A group of gunmen attacked
Liberia's presidential complex today and panic gripped the
Liberian capital, said a report from Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
``There was an attack on the mansion by unidentified gunmen
and shooting broke out,'' said the report quoting one witness.
</P>
<P>
Shops, businesses, markets and schools closed hurriedly and
traffic came to a halt, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said 10 people died in the shooting and at least two
wounded were taken to the nearby Barclay Training Centre (BTC)
army barracks. BTC was the bastion of ethnic Krahn guerrillas at
the heart of militia warfare occurred in the capital last April
and May.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the shooting was not clear, but the ECOMOG troops
moved in with tanks and quickly deployed across the city's
commercial district.
</P>
<P>
Chief warlord Charles Taylor, who started the civil war in
Liberia in 1989 but is now in the ruling council, was about to
drive into the mansion when shooting started, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
Seven weeks of militia fighting in April and May was
accompanied by heavy looting that devastated the capital. That
fighting was mainly between Taylor's forces and ULIMO-j
guerrillas of Krahn warlord General Roosevelt Johnson.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG has just started a new deployment hoping to begin
disarming guerrillas under terms of the latest regional accord to
end the civil war.

MANILA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and
the Moro Islamic liberation front (MILF) have finally agreed to
meet next month in the southern Philippines to pursue a ceasefire
agreement and lay the ground rules for their future peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Rubben Torres said here Wednesday night
that Ghazali Jaafar, MILF vice chairman for political affairs, has
written him to express the desire that the meeting will be after
the 10th of November or thereafter.
</P>
<P>
Torres said that Jaafar is willing to meet with him on an
informal basis, adding that Jaafar also expressed regrets for the
postponement of their meeting which was originally set for last
month as the MILF central committee still had some points to
clarify in the proposed ceasefire agreement at that moment.
</P>
<P>
Torres said the sooner his meeting with Jaafar takes place, the
better, as it would help avert further hostilities between
government and MILF troops in the south of the country.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that at least 50 rebels and six government
soldiers were killed in recent clashes between the two sides in
Basilan province in Mindanao.

<HEADLINE> Tension Continues in Somali Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Tension is continually
rising in north Mogadishu for the second day today as forces
loyal to Ali Mahdi Mohamed and his religious rival Sheikh Ali
Dhere still remain in check points in the city.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi is insisting that Sheikh Ali Dhere and his men
surrender their weapons while Sheikh Ali Dhere is demanding Ali
Mahdi officially rescind his recent decree on court reformation.
</P>
<P>
The two rival forces exchanged fire in north Mogadishu last
night, killing two people.
</P>
<P>
The rising tension has forced 13 international relief workers
to leave the capital for Nairobi, Kenya. Many others are also
expected to leave today.
</P>
<P>
The tension followed Ali Mahdi's issuing of a decree on the
reshuffle of the Sharia Court systems.
</P>
<P>
Under the decree, the name of the Supreme Islamic
Implementation Council has been changed into the Judiciary
Council chaired by Sheikh Sharif Muhidin, who is loyal to Ali
Mahdi.
</P>
<P>
Also under the decree, Sheikh Ali Dhere has been appointed the
Secretary General of the Judiciary Council after he was removed
from the chairmanship of the supreme court. However, the man
appointed by Ali Mahdi for that post, Sheikh Hamud Ahmed Siar,
today refused to accept the appointment.
</P>
<P>
The decree has given the Judiciary Council the highest islamic
authority, which formerly belonged to the Suppreme Court of
Sheikh Ali Dhere.
</P>
<P>
The decree has also given Ali Mahdi the powers of nominating
and sacking all the positions in the Judiciary Council. All these
powers were earlier maintained by Sheikh Ali Dhere. enditem

<HEADLINE> Manila to Discuss Libya's Offer as Mediator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
today that it will have to discuss an offer made by Libya to
mediate in peace talks between the government and the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) in order to avert any possible diplomatic
snags.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with reporters here, Executive Secretary Ruben
Torres said Manila welcomes the offer by the Libyan government,
however the cabinet will have to discuss it and decide whether it
will accept it or not, "considering it will involve some
diplomatic implications."
</P>
<P>
Libyan Ambassador Rajb Azzarouq said Wednesday that his
government is willing to mediate in peace talks between the
government and the Muslim rebel group and that he had met MILF
leaders recently.
</P>
<P>
According to the Libyan envoy, the rebel group is amenable to
his offer as a peace broker.
</P>
<P>
But Torres said he will raise the matter at a cabinet meeting
and with the MILF when he meets its leaders.
</P>
<P>
"The whole cabinet should be informed and the president should
approve the plan for a mediator country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Torres however declined to say at this point whether certain
matters can be better or faster resolved by the participation of a
third party in the talks as this could only be determined when
formal talks begin.
</P>
<P>
The MILF became a major threat to peace in Mindanao after the
government and the Moro National Liberation Front signed a peace
deal in September to end a civil war in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Government troops and MILF forces have been engaged in a
week-long battle in southwestern Mindanao and the fighting has
left at least 50 MILF rebels dead and 3,000 civilians homeless.

<HEADLINE> Zhangjiagang to Be China's Biggest Cold-rolled Sheet Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The recently launched POSCO
project is expected to turn Zhangjiagang, an important industrial
city in east China's Jiangsu province, into the country's biggest
cold-rolled sheet production base.
</P>
<P>
The POSCO project is absorbing 240 million US dollars,
co-invested by Jiangsu's Shazhou Iron &AMP; Steel Corporation and
Pohang Iron &AMP; Steel Corporation from Republic of Korea (ROK).
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, three companies -- POSCO Stainless Steel
Company, POSCO Steel Sheet Company, and Xiaosha Rolled Steel
Processing Company -- are to be built and put into operation in
March 1999, May 1998, and November 1997, respectively.
</P>
<P>
When completed, the POSCO project is expected to turn out some
300,000 tons of steel sheets a year, two thirds of which will be
cold-rolled stainless sheets and zinc-plated sheets.
</P>
<P>
The cold-rolled stainless sheet program of the POSCO project
will cost 180 million US dollars, and is the country's first
started large stainless steel program.
</P>
<P>
A provincial official said the completion of the stainless
sheet program will make Shazhou Iron &AMP; Steel Corporation the
biggest cold-rolled sheet manufacturer in China.
</P>
<P>
ROK's Pohang Iron and Steel Corporation is the world's second
largest iron and steel enterprise, whereas the POSCO project in
Zhangjiagang is Pohang's biggest investment project in China.

<HEADLINE> China Gears up Space Program to Gain Competitive Edge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 31 (Xinhua) -- China is pushing ahead with an
ambitious space program, including a moon-landing, schedule early
in the next century, to gain a competitive edge in global space
development.
</P>
<P>
Manned spaceflights apparently are being given top priority in
the program, which also includes building a heavy solar satellite
in partnership with Germany, and a new generation of lightweight
spacecraft to 'bus' satellites into orbit, according to sources.
</P>
<P>
Wang Liheng, vice administrator of the China National Space
Administration, said the country is expected to make a
breakthrough in manned space technology at the beginning of the
next century.
</P>
<P>
To build a solid foundation for China's launch vehicle
technology for the new century, the country is busy developing key
technologies for a heavy-duty launch vehicle with a payload
capacity of up to 20 tons, a reusable space transportation system,
vehicle re-entry and landing system, and broad-range
communications systems, Li Jianzhong, president of the China
Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
A small spacecraft with low operational cost will be designed,
said Cheng Fangyun, a noted space expert and academician at the
Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). "China has reliable technology
for space tracking, telemetry and control to do this," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to sources, China is working on technologies badly
needed in outer space detection, and moon exploration to provide
cheap transportation systems for the lunar-landing spacecraft for
probing the moon and developing lunar resources.
</P>
<P>
China will launch the second Dongfanghong-3 communication
satellite later this year, and modify the Fengyun-1 meteorological
satellite in 1997 and 1998. The Ziyuan-1 earth resources
satellite, jointly developed by China and Brazil is now in its
final stage, said Xu Fuxiang, president of the Chinese Academy of
Space Technology.
</P>
<P>
Also under development is a small scientific satellite, the
Shijian-5, which is light weight and low cost, and will become a
common 'bus' for small satellites, he said.
</P>
<P>
China also plans to send small meteorological satellites to
provide temperatures of land surface for analysis, as a new way to
detect impending earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
In solar observation, China is co-operating with Germany in
producing a two-ton lunar satellite armed with a solar telescope.
</P>
<P>
According to Ai Guoxiang, a CAS academician, the
100-million-dollar satellite is expected to be sent into orbit
around 2002 if everything goes smoothly.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, China has decided to invest 170 million
yuan to build the world's most advanced sky survey telescope which
can observe at least 100 million galaxies to study the key issues
in cosmology.
</P>
<P>
China is also working on its own space station, besides
co-operating with the United States and Russia in building a
magnetic spectrograph aboard the Alfa station which, scheduled to
be launched at the beginning of next century, is expected to
detect anti-matter and dark matter in the universe, sources said.

BRASILIA, October (Xinhua) -- A passenger plane carrying 90
people crashed today in Sao Paulo, Brazil, soon after takeoff,
but the fate of those on board is not immediately known, an

</P>
<P>
The plane, described as a Fokker-100 airliner by the official,

</P>
<P>
Then the ill-fated airliner operated by Brazilian carrier TAM

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Asia-Pacific countries should
reach a common understanding and cooperate with each other, to
promote peace, security and independence in the region, Thanat
Khoman, former Thai deputy prime minister said today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
During an exclusive interview with Xinhua, the senior Thai
diplomat said that the countries in the region must concentrate
more on their shared interests, rather than their differences.
</P>
<P>
If success can be made in this regard, he said, the
Asia-Pacific region would be better equipped to "prevent
interference and intervention from outside powers."
</P>
<P>
He accused those powers of "using trade, human rights,
democracy, and in certain cases the question of drugs, to
pressurize a number of countries to extract concessions in fields
such as politics and economics."
</P>
<P>
To counterbalance the major powers, he said, Asia-Pacific
countries should deepen understanding, and develop closer
cooperation for "our own interests."
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, countries in the region should try to
develop contacts and cooperation with other countries, especially
those in Europe, added Khoman, who was once Thai ambassador to the
US, and served as Thai deputy prime minister from 1980-82.
</P>
<P>
He cited the Association of South-east Asian Nations (ASEAN) as
an example of rallying regional countries to form a "political and
economic strength."
</P>
<P>
He said that China, as a great Asian nation, plays an
important role in promoting understanding and cooperation among
Asian countries and checking outside intervention.
</P>
<P>
He hoped China will reach better understandings and forge
closer cooperation with ASEAN and other countries in the region,
to contribute to peace, stability and independence of the
Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Khoman, who is visiting China at the invitation of the Chinese
People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, had a meeting with Chinese
Vice Premier and foreign minister Qian Qichen on Wednesday.

The C7 Signalling System (C7) is a data communication protocol
specifically designed to provide reliable signalling and other
information transfer between processors in a telecommunication
network. It is now widely accepted in world telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
The host says that the annual meeting provides a forum where
representatives of international carriers meet to plan for the
introduction and implementation of international signalling
network and services supported by C7 protocol. Constructive ideas
from the meeting will be recommended to the International
Telecommunication Union for further study.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Australian Tourist Groups Worry About Immigration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- At least five groups of Asians
had canceled trips to Australia since the immigration debate made
international news in the past week, the Australian Tourist
Commission (ATC) said today.
</P>
<P>
A tour group of 160 Singaporeans canceled their visit planned
for next month citing "political considerations" and at least four
more Asian groups had scrapped tours, ATC President Jon Hutchison
was quoted by a press release as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said he did not know if the cancellations were related to a
report yesterday of assaults on members of the Singapore Armed
Forces on leave in the North Queensland town of Rockhampton.
</P>
<P>
"The media has tackled the issue in some parts of Asia that
seems to indicate there is some threat of hostility and that is an
issue that the travel industry will not tolerate," he said.
</P>
<P>
The cancellations were made through Perth, West Australia, and
the ATC would consult with the tourism industry nationwide next
week to find out how widespread the trend had become, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Tourism Council Australia (TCA), and the World
Travel and Tourism Council also called for an immediate end to the
debate about restriction of Asian immigration triggered by
Independent MP Pauline Hanson.
</P>
<P>
TCA managing director Bruce Baird said, fallout from the debate
was the first time racism had figured in tourist perception of
Australia. "It is the debate and the length of the debate and the
fact that there's racist overtones in terms of the debate, I think
that's being interpreted in Asia in a way that's not only
detrimental to our tourism but our trade interests". Asian
tourists accounted for 60 percent of Australia's international
tourists, created 350000 jobs and earned more than 10 billion
Australian dollars (8 billion US dollars) for the country,
according to earlier estimates.

"Our current task is to open up new business and to promote our
ongoing business to a higher level," said Wang Weisheng, director
of Tianjin Accounting Firm, the largest in the city.
</P>
<P>
Several weeks ago, Wang's firm began to check accounts for the
Tianjin branch of a Hong Kong investment corporation, and the
clients number of the Wang's firm increased to 2,000 in 1995 from
300 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Accounting firms in Tianjin are concerned with the training of
qualified personnel: Wang's firm has sent many of its employees
abroad for training, particularly to Singapore and the
United States, and the company holds regular training classes in
accounting with noted international accounting firms.
</P>
<P>
With China's opening of the examinations for registered
accountants to overseas applicants in 1994, Tianjin is opening its
door more and more widely to the overseas accounting
firms. Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, one of the six largest accounting
firms in the world, has had its representative office in Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin, the biggest coastal industrial and commercial city in
north China, has nearly 10,000 overseas-funded enterprises. With
the steady deepening of the reform of state-owned enterprises, the
accounting business has a bright future, but faces increasingly
fierce competition, according to authorities.

<HEADLINE> Airport of Goma Reportedly Taken by Tutsi Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The airport of the Zairean city
of Goma has been reportedly taken by the Banyamulenges as heavy
artilleries continued throughout this morning near its airport,
according to reports of the Agence France Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
Humanitarian sources at the airport said that the airport was
taken by the Banyamulenges, the ethnic Tutsis who are fighting
Zairean troops in east Zaire's Kivu region.
</P>
<P>
However, a source at the airport told the AFP that the airport
is still in the hands of Zairean troops.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports said that Zairean troops this morning
pounded the Rwandan border a few kilometers away from the airport
of Goma with intensive artillery fires.
</P>
<P>
AFP quoted local inhabitants of Goma as saying that Rwandan
troops have deployed heavy weapons on the hills overlooking Goma
at the border.
</P>
<P>
All commercial flights to Goma and Bukavu, a city further
south, have been suspended by Zairean government until further
notice.
</P>
<P>
AFP said that while artillery fires raged outside Goma, the
city was completely silent this morning with all the residents and
the staff of international humanitarian groups staying in their
houses to avoid being caught in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Zairean troops and Banyamulenges fought with automatic weapons
and mortars through Wednesday night to this morning around Goma,
and fighting also broke out in Kibumba, 25 kilometers from Goma,
between Zairean forces and unidentified gunmen, said the AFP.
</P>
<P>
Goma, which is the capital of the North Kivu province of Zaire,
has become the last stronghold of Zairean government forces after
the fall of Uvira, another city of the region, to the
Banyamulenges.
</P>
<P>
The situation of Bukavu, capital of South Kivu, is not clear.
</P>
<P>
The AFP quoted a foreign journalist who drove through Goma this
morning as saying that a large number of Zairean troops were
moving around the city.

<HEADLINE> S. African Army, Unions Reach Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The South African National
Defense Force has concluded recognition agreements with employee
unions after long consultation and work stoppages by some soldiers
protesting against conditions of service.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued here today by the army, these
agreements are with about 10 workers unions in the country.
</P>
<P>
The defense force has told commanding officers of various
units that they are obliged to hold regular meetings with the
unions on their working conditions and income.
</P>
<P>
Where more than one union has members in a unit, a defense
force department chamber has been established to do away with
time-consuming meetings with individual unions, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
A labor relations communication forum has also been
established at each unit in the army.
</P>
<P>
The move was part of South Africa's democratic reform which
started two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The workers unions were not allowed to function on military
property during the apartheid years.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, when integration of the army began to become a
reality, the defense force has been plagued by work stoppages and
refusals by some soldiers to accept conditions of service.
</P>
<P>
This resulted in mutiny situations and soldiers marched on the
President's Office in Pretoria to protest in person to President
Nelson Mandela.

<HEADLINE> PLO Official Praises EU Position on Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Farouk Kaddoumi, Head of the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Political Department,
has praised the positive attitude of the European Union (EU),
particularly France, towards the Palestinian issue.
</P>
<P>
Kaddoumi made the remarks at a press conference he gave here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The EU has carried out marked activity through the recent
meetings held by it, the statements issued by it and the
resolutions adopted by it, including the one appointing an EU
special envoy to the Middle East," Kaddoumi said.
</P>
<P>
"The recent statements issued by the EU lay (laid) stress on
the fundamental elements of the issue which should be dealt with
in the Middle East peace process," he added.
</P>
<P>
"They include the right of the Palestinian people to
self-determination and setting (up) a state of their own, the
illegitimacy of setting up or expanding (Jewish) settlements and
pulling down the houses of the Palestinians, the necessity of
redeploying Israeli troops and releasing the Palestinian
prisoners detained in Israeli jails," he added.
</P>
<P>
Kaddoumi pointed out that the EU interest in the Palestinian
issue reached its climax during French President Jacques Chirac's
recent Middle East tour, especially when he delivered a speech
before the Palestinian Legislative Council in the city of
Ramallah, whe he voiced his support for setting up an independent
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the importance of Arab solidarity as a means
of urging western powers to pressure Israel to honor its promises
and give up its provocative and aggressive actions.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Develops Top Brands (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Today Beijing's Shunmei is one
of the largest clothing bases in China with annual sales of over
200 million yuan in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
It is a far cry from just a decade ago when the Shunmei
Clothing Co. Ltd. was a small garment factory in a Beijing suburb.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s it has grown into a corporation, with its fine
clothes exhibited alongside other world-famous brands in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Shunmei has earned more than 20 million U.S. dollars in foreign
exchange, and a profit of 300 million yuan over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
With the establishment of China's socialist market economy and
the expansion of opening up, China began to pay attention to the
production of its own top brands.
</P>
<P>
"China has many state-known brands, and the country should
efficiently use overseas funds to further develop them," said
Cheng Xiuqi, an official with the Beijing Economic and Trade
Commission.
</P>
<P>
Beijing allows state-famous enterprises to draw in overseas
funds, by inviting international commercial loans or issuing
stocks, in a bid to enhance their financial strength, and promote
the development of their brands.
</P>
<P>
Stone Group, which produces electronic typewriters with the
brand "Stone", raised over 400 million Hong Kong dollars by
issuing stocks in Hong Kong.

<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing allows joint ventures to use top Chinese trademarks.
Beijing Five Star Bear Brewery transferred its trademark, "Five
Star", to the joint venture it established with an overseas
brewery, for an annual compensation of four million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Through the efforts of both sides, "Five Star" beer was chosen
as the only beer used at a banquet in the U.S. to celebrate the
founding of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Beijing also allows enterprises to take trademarks as an
investment in joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some Beijing enterprises have managed to establish
brands with the help of overseas corporations.
</P>
<P>
Joint ventures use the brands of their foreign partners to
enhance the competitiveness of their products, such as
"Panasonic", "Philips" and "JVC". The foreign exchange earned by
these enterprises in 1995 was over 40 percent of the total foreign
money earned by all the joint ventures in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The export of "Panasonic" television tubes made in Beijing
earned over 100 million U.S. dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Top brands that belong to Chinese or overseas investors can be
used in the joint ventures they establish.
</P>
<P>
Over 30 percent of the joint ventures in Beijing use the brands
of the Chinese investors. Those using the brands of overseas
investors account for 22 percent, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Economists in Beijing hold that the proper use of overseas top
brands is a good way of establishing and developing Chinese top
brands, but meanwhile, nationally known brands should also be
protected.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Xiuqi believes that the government should encourage joint
ventures to establish new brands, especially new Chinese top
brands. However, he said, that must happen only under certain and
proper conditions.

<HEADLINE> City Prepares Birthday Celebration for Old Giant Panda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, October 31 (Xinhua) -- On Nov. 28, birthday
celebrations will be held for 20-year-olds named Qingqing in this
southeast Chinese city. One birthday "girl" will receive special
recognition: Qingqing the giant panda.
</P>
<P>
Qingqing, who lives at the Zoo of Fuzhou, is regarded as one of
the oldest giant pandas in the world. She has given birth twice,
when she was 18 and again at 19.
</P>
<P>
The Fuzhou Association of Panda Protection and the Fuzhou Panda
Research Center have started party preparations for Qingqing's big
day, and are searching throughout the city for people named
Qingqing whose 20th birthdays also fall on Nov. 28.
</P>
<P>
Five qualified people will be invited to the celebration of the
panda and present gifts to her. They will also become members of
the panda protection association.
</P>
<P>
While the humans will be honored for entering adulthood, the
panda will receive best wishes for her long life.
</P>
<P>
Qingqing has been a well-known citizen of Fuzhou since she came
here in 1980.
</P>
<P>
The giant panda has been listed as one of the most endangered
wild animals in the world. Experts estimate that there are only
about 1,000 pandas living in the wild and in captivity, mainly in
China.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Airline Predicts Loss of 100 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 31 (Xinhua) -- El Al, Israel's state-owned
airline, is expected to end this year with a loss of about 100
million U.S. dollars, according to an Israel Radio report today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted El Al Managing-Director Yoel Feldschuh as
saying that the main cause for the loss is the drop in tourism,
due to the unstable situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
Feldschuh, speaking upon completing one month on his post,
said that other factors for the loss include the government's
"open-sky" policy, which allows almost completely unregulated
competition.
</P>
<P>
Israel was the second country after the United States in
opening itself up for competition among airlines around the
world, he said.
</P>
<P>
The EL AL chief said that unbridled competition among airlines
is a problem worldwide and that the International Air Transport
Association is due to hold an emergency meeting in November to
tackle the issue of ticket-price competition.
</P>
<P>
The "open-sky" policy, he said, was meant to increase
tourism, but it has been shown that incoming tourism is far more
affected by the geopolitical situation than by prices.
</P>
<P>
He also cited the strong shekel, the Israeli currency, and
rising fuel prices as additional factors contributing to the
company's loss.
</P>
<P>
On the government's intention to privatize the airline,
Feldschuh said that under the present circumstances, it would be
difficult for the airline to be sold, stressing that he did not
see "how privatization can take place at this time."
</P>
<P>
Feldschuh described El Al's service as "not bad," but added
that it had to improve. However, the airline had been managed
relatively well with regard to services, he added.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Hold Regular Strategic Consultations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Israel will soon start to
hold regular strategic consultations with Russia's security and
diplomatic establishments to discuss such issues as terror and
Islamic militancy.
</P>
<P>
Today's Jerusalem Post quoted Israeli Ambassador to Russia
Aliza Shenhar as saying that Russia is "willing, like us, to
institutionalize a regular dialogue with us on issues such as
terror and radical Islam."
</P>
<P>
Shenhar made the remarks on the eve of today's visit to
Israel by Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who has
already held talks in Syria, Lebanon and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Primakov, currently on a Middle East tour to seek a more
active Russian role in the American-dominated Arab-Israeli peace
process, will also travel to Jordan and the Palestinian
self-rule area.
</P>
<P>
Shenhar told the newspaper that a preliminary dialogue has
begun between diplomats, but now it will both be regularized and
expanded to "include the entire establishment in both
countries."
</P>
<P>
He said that Russia, which was an official co-sponsor of
the 1991 Madrid peace conference, is also seeking a more active
role in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Both Israeli Foreign Ministry Director-General Eitan Bentsur
and Shenhar indicated that they wanted this role to deal with
reviving the largely moribund multilateral talks on regional
cooperation, designed to supplement the sensitive bilateral
peace talks on peace, security and land.
</P>
<P>
"We very much value the multilateral talks, and we think that
Russia could have a key role in advancing those issues," Bentsur
said, adding that Foreign Minister David Levy is expected to
raise this issue with Primakov during their meeting.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's State Revenue and Spending Falling Short </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's state budget revenue
may reach 96.5 percent and the expenditures hit 96.9 percent of
the original plans, the Finance Minister Ho Te was quoted by the
latest issue of the "Vietnam Investment Review" as saying.
</P>
<P>
Compared with 1995, the revenue has increased by 12.1 percent
and the expenditures by 8.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Calculations by the Finance Ministry showed that in 1996,
export-import tax has reached only 88.9 percent of the plan,
revenue from the state economic sector stands at 94.4 percent,
revenue from industrial and commercial economy and non-state
services stands at 95 percent and revenues from lotteries at 86
percent of the plan.
</P>
<P>
It is anticipated that the budgetary overspending this year
will reach 3 percent of gdp, lower than the maximum level allowed
by the national assembly.
</P>
<P>
The "Vietnam Investment Review" said the economy has suffered
due to the slow sales of goods such as cement, iron and steel,
paper, cigarettes , beer and alcohol, which has caused
difficulties in tax collection in both state and non-state sectors.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Minister said unnecessary budget spending will be
cut because it has been unable to collect all sources of revenue.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that even though priority has been given to
investment and development this year, it is anticipated that only
97.3 percent of the plan would be reached. Special spending has
been reserved for essential construction but it is still
slow-moving with only 55 percent of the budgeted sum spent so far.
</P>
<P>
The minister predicted that in 1997, total revunue of the state
budget will increase by 12.2 percent against the estimated figure
in 1996 and the total expenditures will also increase by 1 5.6
percent against the estimated figure in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Tomb with Frescos Removed to Museum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Archaeologists in northwest
China's Gansu Province have successfully moved a 1,700-year-old
tomb with frescos into the provincial museum in Lanzhou.
</P>
<P>
They placed the tomb half above and half under the ground, a
technique which has been proved to be effective in the
conservation of frescos.
</P>
<P>
The project, planned 20 years ago, recently passed approval.
</P>
<P>
The tomb, located on the top of a pile of bricks on which 67
frescos were painted, was unearthed in the city of Jiayu, in
Gansu, a remote area considered unsuitable for the preservation of
the frescos.
</P>
<P>
Some 9,000 bricks forming two burial rooms, two passes, and
four side chambers were dismantled and sent to Lanzhou about 800
km away.
</P>
<P>
The tomb was restored in the provincial museum with its upper
part above ground.
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts say that this helped to ventilate the tomb
while maintaining the stable inside temperature, an effective way
to protect tomb frescos threatened by damp environment.

<HEADLINE> Zaire, Rwanda Heading for War Amid Refugee Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 31 (Xinhua) - Ethnic conflict in central
Africa has edged toward war between Zaire and Rwanda, with no
sign of relief for more than a million displaced people.
</P>
<P>
Zairean and Rwandan troops traded artillery fire near the
border town of Cyangugu early Wednesday after Zaire warned Rwanda
it would fight to defend its territory and its vast mineral
wealth.
</P>
<P>
"There was a heavy exchange of artillery fire that lasted
about two hours this morning. It is quiet right now," a World
Food Program official in Nairobi said.
</P>
<P>
As Zaire and Rwanda traded tough words, both countries
acknowledged they were headed for war. Rwanda confirmed its
troops entered Zaire ``after they hit our territory and killed
our people.''
</P>
<P>
The conflict began with a Zairean army campaign against ethnic
Tutsis but springs from the deadly rivalry between Tutsis and
Hutus which resulted in nearly one million dead in Rwanda's 1994
genocide and left Zaire the unhappy host to 1.1 million Hutu
Rwandan refugees.
</P>
<P>
Zaire accuses Rwanda and Burundi, whose armies and governments
are dominated by minority Tutsis, of backing Banyamulenge Tutsis
against the Zairean army. About 300,000 Tutsis came to eastern
Zaire and settled down there 200 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Zairean Minister of Information Boguo Makeli also hit back at
Rwanda's Vice-President and Defense Minister Paul Kagame, who had
declared that Rwanda is ready for war with Zaire.
</P>
<P>
``It is pointless for Paul Kagame to say Rwanda is ready to
fight us. The war is already here,'' Boguo said, repeating
Zaire's charges of aggression against Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
As the violence escalated, the special envoy appointed by the
United Nations to bring an end to the crisis said he was
confident he could at least get all sides to sit down and talk.
</P>
<P>
``It's an extraordinarily difficult mission,'' Raymond
Chretien, Canada's Ambassador to Washington, said.
</P>
<P>
``I am confident about establishing a frank dialogue with the
leaders in the area to see what can be done,'' he said in
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
Italy said it hoped Zaire and Rwanda would be able to meet in
Rome on the sidelines of a November 13-17 food summit.
</P>
<P>
Aid workers in Kinshasa said a new wave of refugees fleeing
attacks on camps close to Uganda on Wednesday could swell a city
of homeless in Magunga near Goma to a million.
</P>
<P>
The Roman Catholic bishop of Bukavu was killed and two Spanish
priests were separately held hostage in the town, which saw the
main fighting in Zaire's two Kivu provinces.
</P>
<P>
Aid workers in Kinshasa said a refugee camp in Rumangabo near
the borders of Uganda and Rwanda had been attacked, sending
inmates fleeing.
</P>
<P>
Other refugees were on the march from Katale and Kahindo,
which had not been supplied.
</P>
<P>
``Following an attack on Rumangabo camp, there is another
movement of refugees towards Mugunga. Other refugees have left
Katale and Kahindo for Mugunga, which could soon have as many as
a million refugees,'' one aid worker said.

<HEADLINE> Fewer Tibetans Attend Bathing Festival (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Bath night for thousands of
Tibetans once meant an annual dip in the river or lake.
</P>
<P>
So poor were most people that they traditionally bathed just
once a year, taking advantage of warm July weather, which took
the icy edge out of the snow-fed waters flowing into the rivers
and lakes.
</P>
<P>
For over 800 years Tibet has held its own bathing festival - a
religious and family event, which also gives people the
opportunity to take their yearly dip in the water.
</P>
<P>
Now many people have lashings of hot water in their homes,
thanks to the wonders of solar energy, and dozens of bath houses
and luxury saunas and steam baths have opened their doors.
</P>
<P>
Losang Dundrub, a Tibetan in his 60s, attended the
traditional Tibetan "bathing festival" for decades.
</P>
<P>
But this year he did not go to the Lhasa River that flows
through the Tibet capital of Lhasa, enjoying instead the solar
energy water heater installed in his home.
</P>
<P>
Losang explained it is no longer necessary for him and his
family members to bathe in the river, as they can bath at home
whenever they wish.
</P>
<P>
The bathing festival falls on the seventh month of the Tibetan
calendar, when venus rises in the night sky in the Lhasa
River. The festival lasts for seven days and nights.
</P>
<P>
The custom is at least 800 years old, and during the festival,
Lhasa Tibetans, young and old, male and female, build tents along
the river banks, bathing during the day and singing songs with
family members at night.
</P>
<P>
The festival fell in September this year.
</P>
<P>
"Though bathers could be spotted in the river in twos
and threes this year, the total number of Tibetans attending the
festival is decreasing year by year," said Cering Yang Dron,
Chairwoman of the Tibetan Society of Folk Custom.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Former Information Minister to Run for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Leader Ali Khamenei's
representative in hajji and former information minister Mohammadi
Reyshahri said that he would run for the 1997 presidential
elections, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
His announcement came in an interview with reporters here,
which was carried by today's English-language daily Iran News in
the front page with a headline reading "Reyshahri Formally
Announces Candidacy, Ties with U.S. will Compound Problems."
</P>
<P>
Reyshahri, 50, stated that his faction will "defend the values
of the Islamic Revolution" and is opposed to the relations with
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Reyshahri said that he, along with other politicians, has
formed the Society for the Defense of Values of Islamic
Revolution (SDVIR) to fill the political vacuum which existed in
1995.
</P>
<P>
"Participation in presidential elections is a religious duty
(for) as long as the need exists. There must be a wide range of
candidates so that the people can have several choices," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that his faction had formed several committees
comprising experts to formulate SDVIR's future economic
policies. It opposes any plan which is "unjust and against the
rights of the citizens."
</P>
<P>
The senior clergyman blasted the use of empty slogans for
fighting financial corruption in the country, saying his faction
will take all necessary measures to eradicate the menace.
</P>
<P>
Obviously, Reyshahri had already pointed his figure to his
main rival -- Iran's hardline Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar
Nateq-Nouri.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about his future foreign policy, he said "the
U.S. will compound our problems... it will not be satisfied until
it destroys us ... The nature of the Islamic Revolution
prevents us from coming to terms with (the U.S.) arrogance."

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Build Eleven Subways by 2020 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai will have eleven
subway lines and ten light-track railways by the year 2020,
sources at the Sixth Urban Transportation, Subway and Railway
Exhibition have revealed.
</P>
<P>
The subways and railways will stretch for 351 kilometers in
length, according to the sources, carrying millions of people on
state-of-the-art public transport networks.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2005, Shanghai will have three subway lines and two
light-track railways, which will be 130 km long, and can handle 30
percent of passengers in the downtown area.
</P>
<P>
To complete the ambitious plan, foreign funds will be utilized
and the method of BOT (build-operate-transfer) will be adopted to
raise funds, according to officials of the Shanghai Subway
Corporation. The BOT method will be used in the construction of
the No.3 Subway and two light-track railways, involving a total
investment of 80 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
There is now one subway in the city, which is 16.1 km long and
used by 500,000 passengers daily.
</P>
<P>
A Sino-German joint venture is building a 5.3 km-long extension
of the Subway, which is expected to go into operation early next
year.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the first express subway in the city is under
construction, which is expected to go into operation October 1,
2001.
</P>
<P>
On the completion of the subways, a subway network will take
shape and effectively improve public transportation in Shanghai,
officials said.

<HEADLINE> Fewer Tibetans Attend Bathing Festival (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zholma, a Tibetan resident, said that a solar energy water
heater, and an electric water heater, have been installed at her
house. Her family members can now take baths every day.
</P>
<P>
In the past, most Tibetans only took baths once each year during
bathing festival.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jihong, a researcher at the China Tibetology Research Center
attributed the main reasons for the appeal of the bathing festival
to natiural conditions and religious factors.
</P>
<P>
As Tibet is located in a high elevation area, and most of the
rivers originate from snow mountains, the river water is very
cold.
</P>
<P>
Before the liberation of Tibet, ordinary Tibetans were so poor
that they had to take baths in rivers and lakes in July of the
Tibetan calander, when the temperature reaches its peak.
</P>
<P>
According to Tibetan Buddhism, people can avoid disasters, and
recover from illness, only when they take baths during the festival.
</P>
<P>
With economic development in Tibet, people are paying more
attention to personal cleanliness, and over 20 of public baths have
appeared in Lhasa streets, ranging from ordinary bathhouses to
expensive sauna and steam bathhouses, which usually cost 100 yuan
(12 U.S. dollars) a visit.
</P>
<P>
The privately-run bathhouse usually receive 50 to 100 customers
each day.
</P>
<P>
An expert from the Tibet Solar Energy Research Center said
solar energy is being widely used in Tibet, with local people
tapping the energy for cooking, bathing and powering their
television sets.
</P>
<P>
With support from the government and other provinces, 89
percent of cities and counties in Tibet have built various kinds
of power stations.
</P>
<P>
The health conditions in Tibet have also greatly improved. The
average life expectancy has risen from over 30 years to 63 now.
</P>
<P>
In Yangbajain, some 100 kilometers away from Lhasa, hot spring
bathhouses were built for curing diseases. Some Lhasa residents
went there by taxi during the weekends.

<P>
TOKYO, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Mitsui Fudosan Co., a real estate
company in Japan, is likely to see unconsolidated pretax losses of
more than 40 billion yen in fiscal 1996 ending next March due to
its disposal of real estate with latent losses, an economic daily
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time for the real estate company to post a
loss since its shares were listed on the stock market in 1949. It
registered a pretax profit of 8.4 billion yen in the previous
business year, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun said.
</P>
<P>
Despite losses, the company is likely to post a net profit
since it should post an extraordinary profit of around 50 billion
yen by selling some of its stockholdings in Oriental Land
Co. which will be listed in December, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
By selling the Oriental Land shares and disposing of its bad
assets, the company is likely to pay back its debt of 1,291.5
billion yen and improve its financial standing, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It is likely to be able to continue paying an annual dividend
of 9 yen per share, it said.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Savings Ratio Lags Behind Investment Ratio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 31 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's total savings ratio
has lagged behind the total domestic investment ratio since 1990,
the Bank of Korea said here today.
</P>
<P>
According to the central bank, the country's total savings
ratio stood at 36.2 percent last year, compared with the total
investment ratio of 37.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, South Korea saw its total savings ratio stood at 36.2
percent, well over the total investment ratio of 33.8 percent for
that year. Since then, the nation's total savings ratio has been
outstripped by the total investment ratio.
</P>
<P>
The total savings ratio was 1.2 percentage points behind the
total investment ratio in 1990, compared with shortfalls of 3
percentage points in 1991, 1.9 percentage points in 1992 and 0.8
percentage points in 1994, according to the bank.
</P>
<P>
The lower savings ratio has been cited as the major factor
behind South Korea's snowballing current account deficit and hike
in foreign debt obligations.
</P>
<P>
The bank attributed the lower savings ratio to hikes in private
consumption, whose rate stood at 10.9 percent in 1989, compared
with 5.7 percent in 1993, 7.6 percent in 1994 and 7.9 percent in
1995.
</P>
<P>
It said that South Korea's major rival economies, such as Japan
and Singapore, have seen higher savings ratios than investment
ratios, which bode well for their current account balances and
price control efforts.
</P>
<P>
Japan has been registering higher savings ratio than investment
ratio since 1981. In 1994, Japan's savings ratio was 31.3
percent, compared with an investment ratio of 28.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's savings ratio was 47.3 percent in 1992, compared
with an investment ratio of 40.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Israel Welcomes Syrian FM's Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu has welcomed Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Shara's declaration that his country is not intending to launch
an attack on Israel.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli officials are reportedly expecting Russian
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, Who arrived here this morning,
to further clarify whether Syria intends to continue the peace
negotiations, or to freeze them.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting with 20 European ambassadors Wednesday
night, Netanyahu called Shara's remarks an important
declaration. He said that Israel has no hostile intentions
toward Syria.
</P>
<P>
Shara made his remarks at the Damascus Airport Tuesday while
seeing off Primakov who is currently on a Middle East tour which
has taken him to Syria, Lebanon and Egypt. He will also visit
Jordan and the Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
"Allegations that Syria is escalating the situation and
massing troops to launch a surprise attack are baseless," Shara
said. He accused Israeli leaders of voicing the charge in order to
avoid making peace.
</P>
<P>
Shara's remarks were also welcomed by Israeli President Ezer
Weizman. He said that cooling the atmosphere is very important,
adding that "it is not good to wave the swords of war."
</P>
<P>
However, Weizman, former commander of the Israeli Air Force,
said that the Syrians had a sizable air force, ground force and
armored corps, as well as anti-aircraft power. He noted that
Syria's threats should be taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
Weizman was speaking to disadvantaged youngsters from the
North, who have volunteered to join a pre-army group, which
prepares them for service in the Israeli army.
</P>
<P>
"We are marching toward an era of peace," said the Israeli
president, "but we are not yet there."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
Wednesday called on the Syrians to resume the peace negotiations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Knesset (Israel's parliament), Mordechai
said that all Israel wants "is to sign a sustainable agreement
and bring security to the North."
</P>
<P>
"We have no argument with Lebanon over the borders," the
defense minister added.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the Syrians are exploiting Lebanese
land for their own interests, adding "there is no doubt that
Syria is playing a full and central role in this drama."

25-year-old young man with confidence.
</P>
<P>
A booming coastal city in east China's Zhejiang Province,
Wenzhou is known as the "capital of China's private economy,"
because of its early development of the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Darong is just one of Wenzhou's more than 40,000 private
enterprises now in operation, which produce over 90 percent of the
city's industrial output value.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1993 with a registered capital of 885,000 yuan
(nearly 100,000 US dollars), it is now the 110th largest private
enterprise in China, with this year's output value expected to
surpass 100 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
"To some extent, we owe our success to the cordial
labor-capital relationship within the company," said Yang Bing,
vice general manager of Darong.
</P>
<P>
Since its founding, the company has earnestly implemented the
country's labor law. In 1995, the company signed a collective
labor contract with the trade union, which provides legal
protection for the employees in areas of salary, work hours,
vacation, and personal welfare.
</P>
<P>
Many private entrepreneurs have realized that they must be
concerned with the welfare of their employees if they want their
enterprises to perform well.
</P>
<P>
Although there are dozens of cases caused by disputes between
employers and employees each year, the figure is small in
comparison with the 40,000 private enterprises with nearly 200,000
self-employed people.

<HEADLINE> Current Account Deficit Widens in South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 31 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's current account
deficit amounted to 1.41 billion U.S. dollars in September, up
87.8 percent from the same month last year, said the Bank of Korea
today.
</P>
<P>
The September shortfall has brought the country's cumulative
current account deficit in the first nine months of this year to
17.09 billion dollars, more than two times the red-ink figure of
8.08 billion dollars recorded for the same period last year, the
central bank said.
</P>
<P>
If this trend continues, the annual current account deficit of
this year will surpass the record high of 20 billion dollars, said
a bank official, who attributed the rise mainly to the poor
performance of exports and increasing invisible trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
The country's exports decreased 5.9 percent from a year ago to
10.09 billion dollars in September, mainly due to sluggish
shipments of semiconductors and steel products.
</P>
<P>
The invisible trade deficit in September hit 508 million
dollars, up 100 million dollars from the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
The official described the surge in overseas travel and
shipping expenses as a major reason for the snowballing invisible
trade shortfall.
</P>
<P>
Largely affected by the soaring current account deficit, South
Korea's foreign exchange holdings declined from 33.5 billion
dollars at the end of August 1996 to 32.8 billion dollars at the
end of September.

<HEADLINE> Germany Supports Trans-Asia Rail Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Germany today reiterated
its support for the trans-Asian railway project which Malaysia
would coordinate.
</P>
<P>
Its Transport Minister Mathiihias Wissmann today offered to
help Malaysia in studies on the proposed 4,700km trans-Asia rail
link, which is to run from Singapore to Kunming in China.
</P>
<P>
The expertise of German companies in rail projects could be
used for the studies, he told a news conference here at the end of
his four-day visit to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The proposed trans-Asia railway is envisaged to be eventually
linked to the trans-European railway network.
</P>
<P>
"We offer our active support for this process of Euro-Asian
cooperation, and we are more than willing to help Malaysia who
will act as coordinator for the required studies," he said.
</P>
<P>
Germany is able to offer technologically reliable and
economical solutions based on its successful use of a modern,
innovative high-speed system called ICE (Inter-City Express), he
added.
</P>
<P>
A consortium headed by German company Adtranz is now involved
in the construction of the light rail transit project in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
He said Germany also hopes to conclude a maritime shipping
agreement with Malaysia as soon as possible, for which the first
round of negotiations was held in September and the next round was
expected to take place in Germany next year.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, he said, would be characterized by the
principles of free market access for shipping services, equal
treatment of vessels and shipping companies and the development of
mutual shipping relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that as an industrial country, Germany was especially
dependent on intensive foreign trade, and Malaysia was a trading
partner whose significance could not be under-estimated.
</P>
<P>
Among the states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN), Malaysia is Germany's third largest trading partner after
Singapore and Thailand, while Germany is Malaysia's most important
trading partner within the European Union, with the bilateral
trade volume between 1994 and 1995 increasing by more than 17
percent to 8.6 billion deutsche marks (5.85 billion US dollars).

<P>
HANGZHOU, October 31 (Xinhua) -- 38-year-old Nan Feiyu is
self-employed with two successful shirt shops located in the heart
of Wenzhou, a port city in east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
But in this city, well-known for its prosperous private sector,
Nan is famous not only for his business acumen, but also for his
donations to drop-outs and poor elderly farmers.
</P>
<P>
"Almost every businessman in Wenzhou has made such donations,"
Nan said. "I'm merely one of them."
</P>
<P>
Hu Renmao, deputy director of the Wenzhou Aiding-the-Poor
Office, said, "It has been usual for the self-employed people and
owners of the private businesses here, who have become prosperous,
to donate part of their income to the poor."
</P>
<P>
Local residents call it a "morality project", he said, as they
consider aiding the poor to be in keeping with the Chinese moral
tradition.
</P>
<P>
From January to September this year, citizens from different
circles had donated 100 million yuan (about 12 US dollars) to the
poor mountain area, according to Hu.
</P>
<P>
The Wenzhou Region, with its prosperous eastern plain and poor
western mountain area, is a small-scale reflection of the entire
country.
</P>
<P>
In the western mountain area, about 700,000 people, one-tenth of
the city's entire population, have a per-capita annual income of
less than 500 yuan, but farmers in many eastern rural area earn
more than 5,000 yuan each.

<HEADLINE> ADB to Help Bangladesh Get Electricity from India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
has offered assistance to Bangladesh for facilitating commercial
arrangements between Bangladesh and India for the development of a
132kv double circuit transmission line.
</P>
<P>
Concerned sources disclosed here today that the bank's proposal
for subregional cooperation in the power sector was given in an
aide memoir submitted to the Bangladeshi government Tuesday by an
ADB mission that visited the country on October 22-29.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has planned to get 100-200 megawatt power from
across the border through the proposed 80-kilometer 132kv line
between Jeerhat Substation near India's Calcutta and Bangladesh's
southwestern district Jessore, the sources said, adding that the
ADB team strongly supported the government's recent initiatives
for enhancing subregional cooperation in the power sector.
</P>
<P>
There are 23 power plants in Bangladesh with installed capacity
of 2,908 megawatts, but the maximum capacity actually stands below
2,200 mw as a number of power plants are quite old and lack proper
maintenance. The present government is desperate to do everything
to get electricity in the quickest possible time to meet the
growing shortfall of power.
</P>
<P>
With this objective, an official team last month went to India
to study the cost and benefit of buying energy from India, which
has drawn strong protest from both the opposition party and some
concerned circles.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Banking Business in Progress in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 31 (Xinhua) -- A growing number of foreign
banks have opened representative offices in Myanmar in
cooperation with local private banks since Myanmar underwent
financial and banking reforms in 1990 in line with the
market-oriented economic policy.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar takes three reforming steps in developing its banking
business -- opening local private banks and granting foreign bank
offices as the first phase, establishing joint venture banks
between local and foreign banks as the second phase and opening
foreign banks in the country as the third phase, according to
official reports.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, 43 foreign banks have been allowed to open
representative offices in Myanmar, of which 34 have opened for
operation. They are eight from Japan, six from Thailand, five each
from Singapore and France, four from Malaysia, two each from
Indonesia, Cambodia, Bangladesh, the Netherlands and South Korea,
and one each from Hong Kong, the United Kingdom, Brunei, Germany
and India.
</P>
<P>
As for local private banks, 20 have been established and seven
of them are permitted to handle foreign exchange transactions,
five to deal with credit cards and four to apply hire-purchase
system.
</P>
<P>
In addition to foreign bank offices and local private banks,
Myanmar has six state-owned banks and two state-private banks
established earlier this year, namely, Myanmar Industrial
Development Bank and Myanmar Livestock Breeding and Fisheries
Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
Beginning 1993, Myanmar introduced foreign exchange certificate
(FEC), which is equivalent to the US dollar in value, for the
enhancement of foreign exchange earnings and for the convenience
of tourists visiting the country. The FEC is widely circulated in
the market with FEC exchange centers officially opened this year
enabling people to exchange the FEC with Myanmar kyat at the
market rate.
</P>
<P>
To assist in building the infrastructure and in implementing
the related functions up to the emergence of a stock exchange,
Japan's Daiwa Securities Co. Ltd. has formed with Myanmar a joint
venture securities exchange center in June dealing in securities,
underwriting business, brokerage, stock exchange and other
services.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar enacted the Insurance Business Law in June granting
local private companies as well as those with foreign investment
to run insurance businesses in the country which cover life
insurance, fire insurance, cash-in-safe insurance and fidelity
insurance.
</P>
<P>
In the latest development, two Thai and one Malaysian banks
have signed memorandums of understanding with local private banks
over the past two months to form joint venture banks in Myanmar
signaling the country's entry into the second phase of its
financial reform.

<HEADLINE> Zhuang, Thai People Share Common Ancestor: Scholars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NANNING, October 31 (Xinhua) -- An ancient ethnic group in south
China known for its sailing skills was the common ancestor of the
Zhuang nationality and the Thai people, according to Chinese and
Thai scholars.
</P>
<P>
The Yue nationality settled in coastal areas of south China some
6,000 years ago, according to a joint study done by the scholars.
</P>
<P>
Zhuang is the largest ethnic group in China, whose people mainly
live in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in the southern part
of the country. Thai people are in the majority in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, experts from China and Thailand have
inspected some 30 Zhuang and Thai villages and compared the two
groups in regard to constitutions, natural environment,
archaeological culture, languages, customs, traditional buildings,
religious and sacrificial traditions, folk art and technology, and
production.
</P>
<P>
They have found many common features in constitutions and
languages, which are regarded as the most convincing evidence that
the two groups of people share the same ancestors.
</P>
<P>
For example, more than 80 percent of the basic characters of
the two languages have similar pronunciation.
</P>
<P>
Further study has shown that the Zhuang culture is a mix of
Han and Yue cultures, while the Thai culture is a mix of Yue,
Indian and Cambodian groups.

DHAKA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is
seriously considering action against the so-called "godfathers" in
order to contain terrorism.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the police administration has identified
250 "godfathers" who on their turn control some 20,000 hard core
terrorists throughout the country.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Rice Output Forecast at 32 Million Tons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's 1996 rice
production is forecast to rise 0.6 percent to 32.5 million tons,
chief of the National Logistics Agency (Bulog) said.
</P>
<P>
"The current rice stocks stand at 2.5 million tons, robust to
meet national demand in the face of Christmas," Bulog chief Beddu
Amang said Wednesday here after meeting with President Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) expects production in
the year 1996 to stand at 50 million tons of unhusked rice,
equivalent to 32.5 million tons of husked rice.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, the government set a target for 1996
unhusked rice production at 51.165 million tons.
</P>
<P>
According to official data, in 1995 Indonesia's production
recorded a 3.9 percent increase to 48.45 million tons of unhusked
rice from 1994's 46.64 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Amang said the country will continue to make all out efforts to
maintain self-sufficiency in rice, officials at the Presidential
Palace said today.
</P>
<P>
After being the world's largest rice importer for decades,
Indonesia became self-sufficient in rice in 1984.
</P>
<P>
However, the country had to import rice in 1994 due to natural
disasters, long drought, floods and unpredictable climate changes.

<HEADLINE> Sharp Increase in Afghan Refugees Entering Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 31 (Xinhua) -- A sharp rise in the number of
Afghan refugees crossing into Pakistan has been observed by the UN
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the official Associated
Press of Pakistan said here today.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR Monitors on the Afghanistan-Pakistan borders were quoted
as saying that in early October, an average of 125 new arrivals
were crossing into Pakistan each day.
</P>
<P>
But on October 26, 440 Afghan refugees crossed, and the number
doubled again on October 28 when 870 crossed into Pakistan, they
added.
</P>
<P>
About 10,000 Afghan people are believed to have crossed into
Pakistan recently.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that an increasingly large proportion of the
refugees were coming from Kabul, the major battle field of the
warring factions.
</P>
<P>
The refugees cited a number of reasons for their departure, and
the most prominent one was fear of conscription.
</P>
<P>
Other major reasons for leaving were the renewed fighting in
Kabul and the restrictions imposed by the Taliban on work by women
and on girls' education.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan Taliban Militia overran Kabul on September 27 and
introduced strict Islamic rule in the capital.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Children Grow Taller, Heavier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Children in China have grown
taller by four cm on average and heavier by 1.2 to 2.4 kilograms
in the past ten years.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest survey on nutrition in China, the weight
of children in urban areas has increased by 2.4 kilograms, and by
1.2 kilograms for children in rural regions.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that as children's height and weight serve as major
indicators used in evaluating their nutrition habits, the rapid
growth of their height and weight in the past ten years shows
their physical development has greatly improved.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, six-year-olds were 113.5 cm tall on average, 4.6 cm
taller than those studied in 1982. Those in rural areas were four
cm taller than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
Although the children in China have grown taller and heavier,
their overall nutrition fails to reach the "satisfactory" level
set by an international standard. Some pre-school children still
suffer from poor nutrition, while there is an increasing number of
overweight children in some regions.
</P>
<P>
China has 350 million children under the age of 16, accounting
for one-fifth of the world's total in that age group.

WUHAN, October 31 (Xinhua) -- A World Bank-funded fruit project
in central China's Hubei Province has been successful since its
inception six years ago.
</P>
<P>
The 200 million yuan (25 million US dollars) project has made

<HEADLINE> Why No Pearls in Ancient Tombs? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The reason why pearls have
never been found in ancient tombs is that they easily become
damaged and lose their beauty, according to Chinese scientists.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Hanqin and Yang Jianping, from the Hebei Geology Institute
in north China's Hebei Province, explained that fresh pearls are a
gathering of crystal aragonite.
</P>
<P>
Within 50-70 years, the crystal aragonite will gradually lose
its moisture content and change into calcite, which has no
luster. The calcite soon disintegrates, leaving no traces, the
scientists said.
</P>
<P>
"That's why no pearls have been found in ancient tombs, though
they have been used as ornaments for thousands of years," they
said.
</P>
<P>
Historical documents have shown that pearls were valued in
ancient times because they were rare and shiny without the aid of
processing.
</P>
<P>
Some people believed that a dead body with a pearl in the mouth
would never decompose, making pearls one of the most popular
articles used in burials.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Presidential Candidates on Final Campaign Swing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- United States President Bill
Clinton Wednesday began his final campaign tour which will take
him to a dozen states.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an Eastern Michigan University rally, the president
said: "I don't deserve all the credit. But our policies have
helped you create...jobs."
</P>
<P>
Clinton is scheduled to make at least 20 stops in about 13
states, including an Arkansas homecoming on November 5. Aides are
reportedly planning a victory celebration.
</P>
<P>
He was flying to Colorado late Wednesday for two night events,
then boarding Air Force One again for Phoenix, Michigan and
Colorado, both battleground states, sided with Clinton in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Arizona, where he plans to campaign Thursday morning, is one of
several traditionally Republican states where Clinton could edge
over Republican nominee Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's schedule, which could change with campaign ebbs and
flows, may put him in Nevada, California, New Mexico, Texas,
Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, New Jersey, Massachusetts, New
Hampshire, Ohio and Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dole began his final push for an electoral
breakthrough Wednesday, suggesting Clinton's re-election would
plunge the nation into a recession.
</P>
<P>
"The Clinton recovery ended today," Dole said at a campus rally
in Clarksville, Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
Seizing on a new government report showing that the economy
slowed in the July-September quarter, the Republican challenger
asserted that the U.S. economy "is barely afloat" under Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Clinton argued in Michigan that the new figures show that the
economy is healthier than four years ago. "Our economy continues
to grow steady and strong," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dole has proposed a 15 percent across-the-board tax cut, a
500-dollar per child tax credit and halving the capital gains tax
to 14 percent from 28 percent. He suggests his 550 billion dollar,
six-year economic package would spur the economy to grow at a more
robust annual rate of about 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The fresh attack on Clinton's economic policies came as Dole
began a final week-long tour of the country, many of his
destinations yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
After Tennessee, Dole was traveling to New Orleans and was to
be joined at a rally in Tampa on Thursday by former President
George Bush.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The annual official consultations
between Bangladesh and Japan have ended here with no fresh aid
commitment from Japan under a grant and technical assistance
program, reliable sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese delegation said at the end of the two-day
consultations on Wednesday that Japan may reconsider future grants
and technical cooperation to Bangladesh if Dhaka does not remove
"some impediments" in the way of speedy implementation of various
Japanese-provided projects.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese delegation complained that it had received a list
of projects from the Bangladesh side, but it would be difficult to
study them "unless some pending issues are resolved."
</P>
<P>
Shuichiro Megata, leader of the Japanese delegation, said,
"Despite the best efforts from our side, Japanese-aided projects'
implementation rate was very poor. Inefficiency of the Bangladeshi
administration and delay in taking decision were the principal
causes for slow implementation of the projects."
</P>
<P>
Japanese experts often come across unnecessary delays in custom
clearances and issuance of pass-book, Megata claimed, adding that
they would wait two to three months for the response from
Bangladesh before taking a final decision in this regard.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Russia, Central Asian Nations Pay Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Russia and central Asian
former Soviet republics are paying close attention to the
development of the Afghan situation following the occupation of
the capital, Kabul, by Taliban guerrillas in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
In the past month, high ranking political officials and
military officers of Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzia, Uzbekistan,
Tajikistan and Turkimanistan frequently held meetings to discuss
possible regional security problems brought about by the Afghan
situation, and to work out countermeasures.
</P>
<P>
Proceeding from the interests of their own countries and
international geopolitics, they expressed the hope that the
conflicting factions in Afghanistan could form a balance of power,
and they held negative attitudes towards the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban militia's control of Kabul and their northwards
advance toward the CIS border worried Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and
Turkimanistan because they share common borders with Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
In additon, the ethnic Tajik account for about 30 percent of
the 19 million Afghan population and the ethnic Uzbek account for
12 percent.
</P>
<P>
If the fighting spilled out to the north, the refugees created
by it will impose strong pressures on these countries.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the ideas of the Taliban who pursue a policy of
ruling the country with traditional Islamic doctrine and stopping
women from education and work will have great influence on the
central Asian nations, where the traditional religious ideas are
rooted.
</P>
<P>
The extreme ideology of the Taliban will affect the efforts of
the central Asian nations to establish secular, democratic
political systems in these countries.
</P>
<P>
The Tajik government is worried that Taliban may cooperate with
the anti-government Tajik Islamic guerrillas who were ousted from
there to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Clashes between Tajik government troops, helped by 25,000
Russian soldiers, and the Afghanistan-based Islamic guerrillas
frequently took place at the border.
</P>
<P>
Tajik President Emonali Rakhmonov said the government might
sign a peace treaty with the opposition under the mediation by
Moscow if necessary.
</P>
<P>
For Uzbekistan, the Afghan Uzbek Militia led by Rashid Dostum
is a buffer for its possible direct conflict with Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Uzbek President Islam Karimov said that Dostum was an Afghan
general, and his country had only provided some humanitarian aid
to him so far. But if the Taliban continued to advance northwards
to the border, he could not rule out the possibility of providing
full supporting to Dostum.
</P>
<P>
Although Russia doesn't share borders with Afghanistan, it has
played the most important role on the issue of the Afghan
situation.
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin, under the
instruction of President Boris Yeltsin, convened a meeting at the
beginning of this month in the Kazakh capital of Alma Ata with the
participation of the leaders of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and
Tajikistan to discuss the Afghan situation, and seek a concerted
stand to find measures to protect the CIS-Afghan border.
</P>
<P>
The leaders called on the factions in Afghanistan to stop
fighting and accused the Talibans' execution of former President
Najibullah, a soviet puppet, as atrocity.
</P>
<P>
The development of the Afghan situation offered an excuse for
the Russian troops to stay in central Asia, where Russia has a big
economic interests because of rich oil and natural gas resources
in this area.
</P>
<P>
Experts here said Russia will not pursue the same policy as the
former Soviet Union did in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The fighting between Taliban and the other factions has entered
a deadlock, and the northwards advance of the Taliban has been
stopped.
</P>
<P>
The forces of the former government led by Ahmad Shah Masood
has achieved some victory in the battle field and the Uzbek
militia led by Dostum has opened fire on the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
However, the conflict in Afghanistan is far from an end and
these countries can only wait and see how the situation
develops.

DHAKA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina has disclosed that she would sit with her Indian
counterpart Deve Gowda to resolve the long-standing Ganges
water-sharing issue by December this year.
</P>
<P>
The local press here today quoted the prime minister as saying

prime minister to resolve the issue by this year."
</P>

<HEADLINE> Japan, Good Market for Sri Lanka's Jewelry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Japan has turned out to be a
leading market for Sri Lanka's jewelry with exports recording a
steady increase during the past three years, according to Trade
Ministry sources today.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's jewelry exports to Japan, which stood at 1.74
million US dollars in 1993, rose to 10.3 million US dollars in
1995. The first six months of 1996 have also seen a growth of 27.5
percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that incentives given to the industry by the
Sri Lankan government has helped to increase exports to the
Japanese market. Imports of raw materials have been liberalized,
and manufacturers of jewelry can now buy rough stones with less
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Sri Lanka has great advantage in the Japanese
market, having colorful gemstones and designs inspired by the
country's natural and historic legacy.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka is planning an international jewelry exhibition in
Tokyo early next year, they added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Rejects Russian Proposal to Change Missile Document </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States refused
Russia's proposal to modify a missile defense document which the
two sides agreed to sign on Thursday, a U.S. State Department
spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
State Department Spokesman Nicholas Burns told a news briefing
that Russia's proposed changes to the agreed-upon, Part One
document on the demarcation of strategic, or long-range, and
regional, or "theater," missile defenses were "unacceptable to the
United States."
</P>
<P>
He said the proposals were "inconsistent with the agreement"
reached by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Russian
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov in New York on September 23.
</P>
<P>
The agreement would specify which short-range defense missile
systems are allowed under the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty,
which limits defenses against strategic missiles but was not meant
to address theater missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
Burns noted that the two sides had agreed that Part One of the
negotiations were related to lower-speed theater missile defense
systems and Part Two refers to high-speed theater missile defense
systems.
</P>
<P>
The Part One was successfully completed during the last
Standing Consultative Commission meeting in June, and the two
sides agreed on September 23 to sign the Part One documents by the
end of October in Geneva, and begin discussions on Part Two, Burns
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the two sides had completed the process of
conforming the Part One documents in Geneva last week and had sent
them to Moscow and Washington for approval.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately," Burns said, the Russian government introduced
a series of proposed modifications late last week to the Part One
document "that had been so painstakingly worked out for so many
years."
</P>
<P>
The modifications would, in fact, tie the entry-into-force of
Part One to the conclusion of Part Two, he said, rather than going
in a two-step process.
</P>
<P>
Under these circumstances, it would not be possible for the two
sides to go to Geneva on Thursday and sign the Part One documents,
Burns said.
</P>
<P>
However, the United States would continue to talk about this
issue with the Russian government and hoped the two sides could
"return to their previously-agreed-upon understanding" that the
two ministers reached in September, the spokesman said.

<P>
GENEVA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Four World Health Organization
(WHO) experts are due in eastern Zaire Thursday to evaluate the
risk of epidemic outbreaks in refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
WHO spokesman Philippe Stroot said that the team included an
epidemiologist, a sanitation engineer, a logistic specialist and a
public relations expert.
</P>
<P>
Medical supplies are being built up at Entebbe in Uganda and
special funds will be salted away should needy circumstance
occurs, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
He said that a meeting was held Wednesday by the WHO crisis and
emergency relief committee to discuss and decide on a rapid
reaction strategy.
</P>
<P>
WHO fears outbreaks of cholera, dysentery, malaria and
meningitis among the more than half a million refugees, mostly
Rwandan Hutus, currently taking shelter in camps near the eastern
Zairean town of Goma. The beginning of the rainy season is likely
to aggravate the health problems.
</P>
<P>
The refugees have little food and no clean water after being
forced to flee their former camps because of the fighting between
Zairean troops and Tutsi rebels.
</P>
<P>
An epidemic of cholera claimed tens of thousands of lives in
1994 when an exodus of hundreds of thousands of refugees fled into
Zaire from Rwanda.

DHAKA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- As the deadline for eliminating
child labor from the garment sector expires today, a Bangladeshi

free of child workers.
</P>
<P>
Uzayer Afzal, an executive committee member of the Bangladesh

<P>
HONG KONG, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Five jockeys were taken to
hospital after a sensational pile-up during the fourth race at the
Sha Tin race course Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The five-horse melee was the worst of its kind in the 26-year
history of professional horse racing in Hong Kong, local
English-language newspaper South China Morning Post reported.
</P>
<P>
Three of the jockeys were still in hospital, with such injuries

Wednesday's later races were delayed for some 15 minutes for
safety reasons, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The field in the Class Three, 1,150-meter sprint was racing
into the bottom bend when one of the horses amid the leading pack
lost his footing and fell, throwing the rider to the ground. That
caused a horrible chain-reaction pile-up, bringing down four other
horses and their riders.

<HEADLINE> Britain Announces Interest Rate Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Bank of England today
announced a quarter-point increase in prime interest rate to six
percent, the first rise since February 1995.
</P>
<P>
This was announced after a morning meeting between Chancellor
of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke and Bank of England Governor Eddie
George.
</P>
<P>
Clarke has been resisting pressure for a rate rise from George
who was concerned about over-heating of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The move was a surprise to the British financial and economic
circles. The British government had reduced interest rates four
times in a row since December last year to stimulate economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
Explaining his decision to raise the rate, Clarke said, "We
have delivered a combination of healthy growth and sustained low
inflation unseen for a generation."
</P>
<P>
"I am determined to maintain a firm grip on inflation to
sustain this well into the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
George welcomed this move and said it was a preemptive one,
designed to choke off any inflationary pressures before they took
hold.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates were last changed in June when they were cut to
5.75 percent from 6 percent. That move was opposed by George.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that the move by Clarke was partially out of
the need of economic situation and the pressure from Bank of
England and economic circles.
</P>
<P>
In doing so, Clarke indicated that he would not be controlled
by requirements of the general election, due to be held in May
1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
successfully stored computer images of the world-renowned Dunhuang
frescoes in northwest China's Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that this is the most effective way to preserve the
frescoes in Mogao grottos, which have been inscribed on the World
Heritage List.
</P>
<P>
The technology, which has passed state appraisal, was developed
by the Dunhuang Research Institute and the Lanzhou Institute of
Glaciology and Cryopedology under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
To complete the work, the experts photographed the grottos with
a digital camera and sent the information directly into a
computer. Using modern photo-processing techniques, they can
restore the image to its original color or to any color desired.
</P>
<P>
The experts are now recording images of 80 of the most precious
grottos. The others will be recorded at a later date.
</P>
<P>
The Mogao Grottos, built during 6th-14th Century, have 2,000
color statues and over 40,000 square meters of wall paintings.

<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The number of deep-draft
ships that passed through the Panama Canal increased by 0.6
percent during the first nine months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The number of ships that passed through the transoceanic canal
from January to September was 13,722, compared with 13,631
during the same period last year, the Consular and Boat Division
of the Panamanian Finance Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Because of the high demand for use of the canal, the Panama
Canal Commission has decided to raise the tolls for deep-draft
ships.
</P>
<P>
Under the system, the net tonnage on which the canal tolls are
based for deep-draft ships is calculated on the space available
for cargo.
</P>
<P>
The tariff paid by other ships, including warships, apart from
military and naval transportation ships, coal bunkers, supply
ships and hospital ships, depends on their real displacement
tonnage.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
will provide south China's Hainan Province with a loan of 53
million U.S. dollars to develop agriculture and natural resources.
</P>
<P>
ADB officials said that the project is conducive to the
development of agricultural resources in this southernmost Chinese
island province, as well as the regional economic development and
ecological protection. It will also generate reliable economic
benefits.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said the entire agricultural and natural
resource development program has four parts: creating a
multi-function economic forest belt; production, processing,
storage and transport of off-season fruits and vegetables;
planting and processing coconuts; and planting and processing
vanilla.
</P>
<P>
The project will cost 1.1 billion yuan (133 million
U.S. dollars). ADB loans will cover up to 41.73 percent of the
entire investment.
</P>
<P>
The province has rich agricultural resources, and the rural
economy has been increasing at a growth rate of 10 percent over
the past five years.
</P>
<P>
However, there are 800,000 rural people in the province still
living under the poverty line of 550 yuan, due to poor
agricultural techniques and inadequate investment for farming.
</P>
<P>
Local officials explained that all the projects will be
implemented in the province's poverty-ridden areas and will play a
big role in helping local farmers become prosperous. The
implementation of the off-season fruits and vegetables projects
alone will benefit 50,000 farmers.
</P>
<P>
The investment program will be completed within five years,
said local officials.

<P>
PARIS, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Pete Sampras, Thomas muster,
Boris Becker and Goran Ivanisevic filled the roll of exodus of
seeded players at the 2.5 million U.S. dollar Paris Open tennis
tournament here after Wednesday's matches.
</P>
<P>
The defending champion Sampras went out at his first hurdle
with straight-set defeat to Swiss Marc Rosset 4-6, 4-6.
</P>
<P>
Rosset, 2.01 meters in height, who lost to Andre Agassi here in
the 1994 final, thundered 20 aces to break Sampras' games in the
75-minutes match.
</P>
<P>
And Boris Becker followed suit. The title in Stuttgart last
weekend did not give him further fortune as he lost to Spaniard
Carlos Moya 3-6, 7-5, 4-6 in the second round.
</P>
<P>
The sixth seed attributed his defeat to the noisy crowd and an
enormous television screen that disturbed him in the match.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss Rosset now faces Spain's 16th seed Felix Mantilla for
a berth in the last eitht while Moya, 20, will take on 12th seeded
Thomas Enqvist of Sweden .
</P>
<P>
Edberg, the 1990 champion of the event, continued his winning
way in his last performance before his retirement as third seed
Muster retired from a recurring hip injury.
</P>
<P>
Edberg won the only set 6-2 before Muster, who also withdrew in
the first match at Stuttgart last week, gave up the match.
</P>
<P>
Goran Ivanisevic, the 1993 winner, had a poor play in the
dramatic moments, losing to Paul Haarhuis in the opening match for
the second consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
The fifth-seeded Croatian, who has already qualified for the
ATP Championship finals in Hannover, let his Dutch opponent easily
seal a 6-3, 6-2 win in 54 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Three other seeds, Andre Agassi, Jim Courier and Wimbledon
champion Richard Krajicek, all went out on Tuesday while other two
of Alberto Costa of Spain and Marcelo Rios of Chile followed the
steps of Sampras.

TAIYUAN, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The base of a 54-meter-high
leaning pagoda, Wenfeng, in this capital of north China's Shanxi
Province has been reinforced.
</P>
<P>
It is the second time this year the pagoda has undergone
renovation. The first work was done to prevent it from leaning.
</P>
<P>
The pagoda, one of a pair built in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644)
and a symbol of Taiyuan, was leaning to such a degree that its top
was 2.86 m out of line with the center of its base. The work has
helped to reduce the distance by two meters.
</P>
<P>
In the recent reconstruction, experts built a cement ring around
the tower's base, so that it will not deteriorate from loosened
clay and water.

<HEADLINE> Chile FM: Ecuador, Peru to Settle Border Issue by Year End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador and Peru have agreed
to settle their thorny border issue before the end of the year,
said Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza today.
</P>
<P>
Insulza said Ecuadoran Foreign Minister Galo Leoro and Peruvian
Foreign Minister Francisco Tudela agreed in Santiago, Chile,
Tuesday that their governments will negotiate their border issue
definitively before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers reached the agreement after two days
of intense meetings, which were also attended by representatives
from Argentina, Brazil, Chile and the United States, four
guarantor countries of the peace process over the border issue
between Ecuador and Peru.
</P>
<P>
The border dispute over an Andes range known as the Cordillera
del Condoor had brought Ecuador and Peru to military
confrontations in 1981, 1991 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
The latest confrontation in early 1995, in which about 50
people were killed and more than 100 wounded, was ended on
February 17, 1995, as the two countries signed the Itamaraty Peace
Declaration in Brazil under international mediation.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed on Tuesday, Ecuador and Peru pledged
to continue their border talks in a way that the two sides will be
able to tackle their persistent problems separately, orderly and
without any vetos, according to Insulza.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed on the procedures of how discussions
will be carried out, what the underlying impasses are and how to
resolve them, Insulza said.

<HEADLINE> Libyan Envoy Brokers Peace Deal with Philippine Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The Libyan ambassador to the
Philippines met with leaders of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF) to help broker a peace deal between the Muslim rebel group
and the Philippine government, the newspaper Manila Chronicle said
today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Libyan ambassador Rajab Azzarouq as saying
that he has met MILF leaders in Cotabato city, the southern
Philippines, recently.
</P>
<P>
The envoy said that his initiative was in line with the aim of
the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) to help the
Philippine government attain peace in Mindanao and ensure the
success of its newly signed peace pact with the Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF).
</P>
<P>
But the paper said that the ambassador refused to gave details
of his meeting with MILF leaders, who had rejected the peace pact
signed by the government and the MNLF in September to end three
decades of civil war in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Azzarouq said that he was confident the MILF would reach a
separate peace deal with the government based on a different frame
of negotiation.
</P>
<P>
The MILF wants a comprehensive pact that will include the MILF
in the integration process, and Libya and other OIC members are
studying how the MILF will fit into the overall peace plan for
Mindanao, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan envoy said that OIC leaders are planning to sit down
with Philippine government officials to discuss the peace
initiative in the south.
</P>
<P>
Despite the peace deal between the MNLF and the government,
Filipinos in Mindanao have not enjoyed real peace. Since last
week, government troops and MILF rebels have been fighting in
southwestern Mindanao. The fighting has left at least 50 rebels
dead and over 3,000 civilians homeless.

<HEADLINE> Cliff Paintings Reveal Change of Housing of Ancient Nomadic Tribes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese northern nomadic tribes
gradually moved out of caves into tents made of tree branches and
animal skins and finally into yurts. Their living habits over the
past thousands of years, have been chronicled in local cliff
paintings.
</P>
<P>
Such paintings have been found recently in Mount Yinshan, Mount
Helan, and the Badain Jaran Desert in north China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the cliff paintings reveal the history of
housing of the nomadic tribes in the area.
</P>
<P>
Historical documents have shown that the ancestors of the
nomadic tribes moved out of caves some 3,000 to 4,000 years ago,
when they became more dependent on raising animals than hunting.
</P>
<P>
On vast grassland, the ancestors built their first house, a
tent made of tree branches and animal skins.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the largest tent group were like those depicted in
cliff paintings in the Badain Jaran Desert. A big tent, most
probably used by the tribe leader, was painted in the center of
another 17 tents set in two rows.
</P>
<P>
During the Warring States Period (475-221 BC), the earliest
yurt, a traditional circular dwelling, was initiated on the basis
of tent. The inventors might well have been the first settlers at
an area between mountains and grassland in the western part of the
region, the Di people.
</P>
<P>
Yurts have served as movable houses for such nationalities as
Xiongnu (Hun), Xianbei (Sienpi), Tujue (Turk), Khitan and
Mongolian, who roam over the northern grassland successively.
</P>
<P>
Even today some Mongolian people in remote areas live in
yurts.

<HEADLINE> First Argentine Satellite Launch Called Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The launch of the first
satellite to be built in Argentina failed today at the Wallops
Base in Virginia, United States, due to a problem in the carrier
rocket.
</P>
<P>
A problem was detected in the separation system of the
U.S. Pegasur launch rocket 10 seconds before launch time,
scheduled for 02:41 p.m., Argentine time.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine authorities said the satellite was in good
condition and that plans for another launch would be announced
soon.
</P>
<P>
The SAC-B, a satellite weighing 181 kilograms and for
scientific experiments, was designed and built by 40 Argentine
scientists under the supervision of the Argentine National
Commission of Space Activities (CONAE).
</P>
<P>
The satellite was programmed to function for three years in
orbit, on a mission to measure and detect certain astronomical
phenomena and to investigate solar physics.
</P>
<P>
The space agencies of the United States, Italy and Brazil also
took part in the project by programming the launching and
contributing to the scientific instruments needed to analyze the
data from the satellite.
</P>
<P>
The cost of building and launching the satellite, estimated at
34 million U.S. dollars, was financed jointly by the four
countries.
</P>
<P>
The SAC-B satellite is part of Argentina's National Space
Program, directed by the CONAE to promote agricultural and
forestry production, oversee fishing activities, evaluate and
exploit ground and underground resources and monitor environmental
problems.
</P>
<P>
Another satellite being built by the CONAE is the SAC-C which
will be put into orbit within three years. The project is assisted
by space agencies from the United States, Italy, Brazil and
Denmark.
</P>
<P>
The SAC-C will provide information from outer space on
desertification and the characteristics and distribution of the
vegetation in the Patagonia area.

<HEADLINE> Portugal FC Porto Books First Berth in Last Eight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Portugal's Fc Porto became the
first team to book its berth in the last eight of the European
Champions Cup on Wednesday with its victory over Rosenborg of
Norway.
</P>
<P>
By nipping Rosenborg 3-0 at home turf, Porto kept its winning
streak intact with 12 points after four home-away games against AC
Milan, Gothenburg and Rosenborg.
</P>
<P>
In front of 25,000 home fans in Lisbon, the Portuguese had
their dominance throughout the match and displayed their flair and
form with confidence.
</P>
<P>
Former Yugoslavian star Zlatko Zahovic found the target first
in the 32nd minute and his compatriot Ljubimko Drulovic converted
a free kick nine minutes later to put Porto 2-0 ahead.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen minutes after the break, Brazilian Artur made it 3-0
with a solo run into the arc.
</P>
<P>
In other matches, defending champion Juventus of Italy thrashed
Rapid Vienna of Austria 5-0, striking a confident step towards the
last eight.
</P>
<P>
It was a juicy harvest for Juventus that had scored merely
three goals in the first three games.
</P>
<P>
The first goal on Wednesday came from Alen Boksic in the fourth
minute and Uruguayan Paolo Montero swung in a header in the 28th
minute.
</P>
<P>
Within a minute, Alessandro Del Piero made it 3-0 before both
Boksic and Del Piero netted their second goals in the second half
of the game.
</P>
<P>
At Old Trafford, Fenerbahce of Turkey stunned the British fans
with a 1-0 victory, which put an end to Manchester United's proud
40-year unbeaten home record in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Glasgow Rangers of Scotland was still to win its first game
after four matches as Ajax of the Netherlands went home with a 1-0
win.
</P>
<P>
However, the top spot in Group A was captured by Grasshoppers
Zurich who beat Auxerre 3-1 in Switzerland after a defeat in
France a fortnight ago.
</P>
<P>
Both Ajax and Grasshoppers garnered nine points with the latter
taking the first place on gaol difference, and Auxerre remained in
the battle on six points.
</P>
<P>
AC Milan defeated Gothenburg 4-2 in the San Siro and seemed to
be on the way to qualify for the last eight as the second-placers
in Group D.
</P>
<P>
Marco Simone was the hero for the Italians as he set up the
first three goals in the first half for Zvonimir Boban's header,
Demetrio Albertini's penalty and Tomas Locatelli's attack.
</P>
<P>
Atletico Madrid had its revenge against Borussia Dortmund,
winning its 2-1 away victory after a home defeat two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The two stood on nine points each for the top two spots in the
group, as both Widzew Lodz of Poland and Steaua Bucahrest scored
only three points apiece despite Lodz's 2-0 win over Bucahrest.

<HEADLINE> Guatemala Sets Conditions for Resuming Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Guatemalan President Alvaro
Arzu warned today that the resumption of the peace talks between
his government and the guerrillas would depend on a satisfactory
explanation from the rebels for the recent kidnapping incident.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Guatemalan government suspended peace talks with
the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unit (URNG), planned for
Tuesday in Mexico City, saying the recent abduction of an
86-year-old wealthy woman by the guerrillas had violated terms of
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
After being arrested by police on October 19, Rafael Valdizon
Nunez, a URNG commander, confessed that his men have been holding
Olga de Novella hostage since August 25.
</P>
<P>
Valdizon, also known as "Comandante Isaias," is one leader of
the four separate guerrilla armies that make up the URNG.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of peace negotiations, the guerrillas have
promised to end such means of fundraising by abducting wealthy
Guatemalans.
</P>
<P>
The Guatemalan president said that though he set conditions for
resuming the peace talks, he was confident that a final peace
accord would be reached before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Guatemalan government and the URNG initiated peace
negotiations to end the country's 36-years-old civil war in April
1991, the longest in Latin America.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Home cooks in Shanghai can
dish up two vegetables a day - without ever serving the same one
twice in the same year!
</P>
<P>
It is because China's biggest city boasts more than 700 species
of vegetables, a record high in the area's food availability.
</P>
<P>
But whether housewives in Shanghai will take up the challenge
is another matter.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics from a municipal department in charge of
agricultural science show that Shanghai residents now enjoy more
than 700 species of vegetables.
</P>
<P>
Agro-technicians have improved some existing species, saved
other endangered species, and imported fine species from abroad.
</P>
<P>
Official figures indicate that over the past three years, the
municipal government has put more than 400 million yuan (48
million US dollars) into the upgrading of vegetable cultivating
facilities.

<HEADLINE> Switzerland Joins NATO's Partnership for Peace Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland today announced that
it is joining the NATO's Partnership for Peace (PFP) program,
without losing its neutrality.
</P>
<P>
The decision to join the PFP was made by the Swiss Federal
Council (cabinet) in Berne.
</P>
<P>
A federal council communique said participation in the PFP did
not create any obligations under international law nor did it
affect neutrality.
</P>
<P>
"The federal council will make it clear that Switzerland is
neutral and does not want to enter NATO," it added.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet authorised Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti to sign
the necessary documents.
</P>
<P>
The 16-member North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
launched its PFP program in 1994 to help foster ties with its
former Warsaw Pact adversaries and other neutral countries.
</P>
<P>
The program now includes 27 partners including such neutral
countries as Finland, Austria and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Local observers said Switzerland made the move out of
consideration of its interests in the post-Cold War era.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland has, for the first time, allowed NATO-led
peace-keeping troops and their equipment to pass through its
territory on their way to Bosnia, and has taken an active part in
the activities of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE).

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines Hit by Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Ground employees of Philippine
Airlines (PAL) launched a nationwide strike last night, paralyzing
the airlines' operations in various airports all over the
Philippines, as well as canceling several international flights.
</P>
<P>
In an announcement published here today, the airlines said that
it canceled eight international flights as well as six domestic
flights as of 19:00 (11:00 GMT) yesterday.
</P>
<P>
It would reduce the number of domestic flights in routes where
it has competitors and "reducing existing resources to points
where PAL is the sole carrier," PAL said.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of passengers were stranded last night after workers
in the airlines began the nationwide strike, which was organized
by the 9,000-strong PAL Employees Association (PALEA).
</P>
<P>
The strike came a few hours after President Fidel Ramos
rebuffed a PALEA proposal for him to intervene in the labor
dispute.
</P>
<P>
The airlines management said that it was saddened by the PAL
union's decision "to defy the law by staging an illegal strike."
</P>
<P>
But the union accused the management of undermining its right
to collectively bargain for the workers' benefits when it issued a
memorandum to employees urging them to avail themselves of a
financial package that would allow them to own PAL stocks.
</P>
<P>
PALEA Vice President Jerry Rivera said that the management did
not even bother to submit the offer to the union and instead chose
to ignore the union's call for a dialogue to discuss the proposals
for a long-delayed collective bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
"This is our last resort to defend ourselves from the
management's on- slaught to our members," he said.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference yesterday afternoon, President Ramos, who
over a year ago intervened in a PAL labor dispute, said that he
had left the problem in the hands of the Department of Labor.

BONN, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The Hamburg court began its
hearing on Wednesday in a civil suit filed by Monica Seles against
the German Tennis Federation.
</P>
<P>
Seles, 22, was seeking 24.4 million marks (16.3 million US
dollars) in compensation for her lost income after being stabbed
in her back in 1993 by Guenter Parche, a fan of Steffi Graf.
</P>
<P>
Parche was later convicted and received a two-year suspended
sentence.
</P>
<P>
Seles challenged the federation for lack of security measures
during the Hamburg tournament.
</P>
<P>
However, the accused argued that general security steps had
been taken and no specific security standards were violated.
</P>
<P>
A ruling in the case was expected on December 19.

<HEADLINE> First Test Tube Twins Born in Costa Rica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The first Costa Rican twins to
be conceived in a test tube have been born in a public hospital in
Cartago, a city about 25 kilometers southeast of San Jose, Costa
Rica's capital.
</P>
<P>
Hospital doctors said they decided on Tuesday night to
interrupt the pregnancy after 37 weeks and delivered the babies
through a Caesarian operation, because of the transversal position
of the babies.
</P>
<P>
The delivery was normal despite the mother having contractions
and changes in her blood pressure. The baby girl was found to be
growing more slowly than her twin brother, the doctors said.
</P>
<P>
This is the first delivery of twins conceived "in vitro" (in
glass) in Costa Rica. Doctors said the possibility of twins being
conceived by in vitro fertilization was nearly 10 times greater
than in normal pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
The mother, a Guatemalan married to a Costa Rican, had been
treated for infertility for five years until she and her husband
decided to take part in the in vitro fertilization program.
</P>
<P>
This program, initiated in 1984, produced its first vitro baby
in Costa Rica in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Since then a heated debate has been stirred over in vitro
fertilization. The Legislative Assembly is currently studying
legislation on the issue.

<HEADLINE> China to Build Sculptures for Noted Scientists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 31 (Xinhua) -- It's hard to believe that
Newton, Darwin, Galileo and Einstein will meet in the Chinese
capital one day in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
But some Chinese people are working to turn the impossible
into reality - by erecting giant sculptures of the famous men.
</P>
<P>
Four-meter-tall sculptures of 12 other noted foreign and Chinese
scientists have also been set up in the Sculpture Park of
Chinese and Foreign Scientists and Engineers, which is located
next to the Badaling section of the Great Wall in suburban Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The project was started in 1994, according to Ma Yang, a member
of the China Association of Science and Technology, which
sponsored the sculptures.
</P>
<P>
"We hope our work will encourage more people to pay closer
attention to science and technology, and to show respect to
scientists," Ma said.
</P>
<P>
It is believed to be the first project of this kind in the
world, according to Ma.
</P>
<P>
The second group of sculptures, including Chinese geologist Li
Siguang and physicist Zhou Peiyuan, will be erected next year.
</P>
<P>
The total number is to reach to 2,000 by the end of the year
2000, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
The association also plans to invite famous scientists and
engineers to plant trees in the sculpture park, where they will
sign their names, or leave prints of their hands and feet in the
cement beside every tree they plant.
</P>
<P>
"We'll build this park into an ideal educational center for
young people, encouraging them to love science and our country,"
Ma said.

RIYADH, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian Jose Ze Mario was
sacked as coach of the Saudi national soccer team, the Saudi

</P>
<P>
Ze Mario was given the boot after Saudi Arabia's poor
performance at the just-concluded Gulf Cooperation Council Cup
tournament.
</P>
<P>
As defending champions, the Saudis had a poor finish by losing

With a 2-2-1 record and eight points, Saudi Arabia finished
third in the six team tournament behind Kuwait (4-0-1) and Qatar

</P>
<P>
The 46-year-old Brazilian was to be replaced by Tilo Vingada of
Portugal, coach of the Portuguese team for Atlanta Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Ze Mario was hired in 1995 after he led the Riyadh Football
Club to league and cup titles.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen Chinese ministries and
organizations are to launch an anti-poverty drive promoting the
integration of poverty relief and family planning in rural areas,
according to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
Delegates to the on-going National Working Conference on
Integration of Poverty Relief and Family Planning recommended a
wide range of measures, based on a consensus that family planning
and poverty relief are equally important, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The All-China Women's Federation pledged at the conference to
help at least one million poor mothers out of poverty in the next
four years and to improve reproductive health care services for
rural women in co-operation with the State Family Planning
Commission.
</P>
<P>
The State Science and Technology Commission will fuse family
planning activities with its various poverty relief and technical
aid projects to help develop rural people's understanding of
reproduction and encourage them to follow State family-planning
policies.
</P>
<P>
Supporting four million poor farmers in agricultural
development by the year 2000 is the Ministry of Agriculture's
target. Priority will be given to households with fewer children.
</P>
<P>
The National Family Planning Association plans to expand a
program which integrates its activities in the three areas of
family planning, helping women increase their income and upgrading
maternal and child health care.
</P>
<P>
An average of three million people a year have benefited from a
state illiteracy campaign for rural women since it was launched in
1989, the report quoted Huang Qizao, vice-chairperson of the
All-China Women's Federation, as telling the conference.
</P>
<P>
Apart from teaching them to read and write, the program
includes courses on farming science and technology, and on family
planning and reproduction.
</P>
<P>
The conference, held in Guiyang, capital of southwest China's
Guizhou Province, was organized by the State Family Planning
Commission and the Leading Group on Poverty Relief and Development
under the State Council.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 30 (Xinhua) -- President Jacques Chirac today
proposed that an international conference be convened to tide over
the crisis in the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
He told a cabinet meeting that the conference should discuss
such issues as the refugees, the 1993 and 1994 genocide in Rwanda
and Burundi, the composition of the Rwandan and Burundian
governments, the protection of ethnic minorities and international
aid to recover the economies of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
France has proposed a regional summit with the participation of
heads of state from Zaire, Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, Tanzania and
Kenya in order to prevent a genocide similar to the one that took
place in 1994 in Rwanda, according to local press.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the French president met Cameroon President Paul
Biya, Gabonese President Omar Bongo and Congoless President Pascal
Lissouba.
</P>
<P>
He discussed the situation around the Great Lakes region where
most of the refugee camps are located.
</P>
<P>
The fighting in eastern Zaire near the border with Rwanda in
the past 10 days has caused a new refugee exodus. People fleeing
the war between Zairean and Rwandan troops amounted to 300,000,
according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half a million refugees, mostly Rwandan Hutus, are
reportedly facing starvation and disease in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations and European Union both dispatched special
envoys to the region to negotiate a cease-fire between Kigali and
Kinshasa.

<HEADLINE> US to Provide Aid to Iraq's Kurds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration
announced today that the United States will contribute 7.3 million
dollars to the United Nations' fund for humanitarian relief in
Iraq, but the aid will be directly channeled to feed destitute
Kurds in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. decision to provide the assistance came after the
United Nations released this week a report which claimed 4,500
Iraqi children were dying monthly from malnutrition and disease as
a result of economic sanctions, still in force owing to U.S.
insistence.
</P>
<P>
But State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns, in announcing
the humanitarian aid, said it was not sanctions but Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein's squandering that has plunged the
country into poverty.
</P>
<P>
He told a routine State Department briefing that Saddam has
spent roughly 2 billion dollars building 48 palaces and other
luxury residences throughout Iraq, In addition to that, "we
believe he's spent untold millions of dollars... rebuilding his
army, maintaining his presidential lot, and other luxury
expenditures," he added.
</P>
<P>
Burns said the U.S. humanitarian aid was earmarked for Kurds
residing in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We do intend to contribute 3.7 million dollars, with the
caveat that this money be used to assist the Kurds in northern
Iraq.... I do believe we'll be able to work out that stipulation
with the United Nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
The economic embargo on Iraq was imposed by the U.N. Security
Council following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990. It remains
in place because the United States insisted that Iraq still
constitutes a threat to its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
But the sanctions designed to punish Saddam's policies by
choking off purchases of Iraq's bountiful petroleum reserves do
not prohibit Baghdad from importing humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations approved a plan in August that would permit
Iraq to raise fund by exporting limited oil to buy food and other
daily necessities.
</P>
<P>
But the plan was put on hold following a recent crisis in which
the United States launched missile attacks against Saddam for his
troops entering the norther part of the country, which is a safe
haven for the Kurds, imposed by the United States and its allies
following the Gulf war.

<HEADLINE> New York Stocks Turn Slightly Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street turned
lower today after signs of continued increase in home sales
dampened enthusiasm over an earlier report that reinforced an
outlook for tame inflation and steady interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 13.79 to 5,993.23,
dipping below 6,000.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues barely outnumbered decliners on the New York
Stock Exchange, with its volume totaling 437.78 million shares, as
against 441.08 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.61 to 700.89, the
NYSE's composite index fell 0.41 to 372.72, and the American Stock
Exchange's market value index fell 0.60 to 565.29.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 3.19 to 1,206.24.
</P>
<P>
Stocks started the session higher with bonds.
</P>
<P>
But bonds slipped back near opening levels, pressuring stocks,
after a subsequent report demonstrated some stronger-than-expected
activity in home sales toward the end of the quarter.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Call for Greater Efforts to Eradicate Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese delegation
to the United Nations today called for greater efforts to
eradicate poverty and stressed a comprehensive approach.
</P>
<P>
The fundamental way of eradicating poverty lies in helping
developing countries gradually foster their internal capability
for shaking off poverty, getting rich, and enhancing
self-accumulation mainly through their own efforts, Cui Ying, said
on behalf of the Chinese mission at a meeting today of the U.N.
Committee of Economic and Financial Affairs.
</P>
<P>
She said that in the process of poverty eradication, it is
necessary to observe the principle of sustainable development,
protect the environment, mindful of the issue of sustainable
exploitation of resources, and curb excessive population growth.
</P>
<P>
Measures in line with local realities of different countries
should be encouraged, she said.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to enhance multi-leveled international
cooperation of many forms," Cui said. The problem of poverty
besetting developing countries has been caused by historical
misfortunes and an unfavorable external economic environment, she
said, adding that it is, therefore, necessary to enhance
cooperation of many forms.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese representative also called for further coordination
within and outside the United Nations system.
</P>
<P>
She gave an account of China's efforts in poverty alleviation.
The number of people in poverty in the country declined to 65
million at the end of 1995 from 80 million at the end of 1993, she
said.
</P>
<P>
Despite some achievements, she said, China remains the largest
low-income country of the world, and poverty eradication remains a
heavy task.

<HEADLINE> British Shares Down Sharply on Surprise Rate Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Major European stock markets
ended mixed today, with British shares finishing well down after a
surprise base rates rise caught the market off guard while German
stocks closed slightly higher.
</P>
<P>
Share prices in London had climbed higher in early trading
today before slipping back sharply after a surprise quarter-point
base rate rise to 6 percent, with the FTSE 100 index lossing 29.6
points at the close to 3,963.9.
</P>
<P>
Traders said that monetary tightening overshadowed a solid Wall

lower by a weak future and drifting gilts.

In Paris, French shares reversed the day's gains and closed
down slightly, with the CAC-40 index at 2,124.76, 0.98 points
lower.

German shares in Frankfurt ended the day's trading slightly
higher, but at the session's low point, with the DAX-30 index
finishing 5.11 points up at 2,678.73.
</P>
<P>
The market had earlier seen gains on the back of firmer German
bonds but later retreated on profit-taking and a weaker dollar.

<P>
London's FTSE 100 leading British shares ended 29.6 points down
at 3,963.9. The CAC-40 share index in Paris finished down 0.98 at

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Economy Begins to Return to World Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav economy has
concluded so far this year over 600 foreign capital investment
contacts worth about 130 million Deutsch marks (nearly 90 million
U.S. dollars), a government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
President of the Yugoslav Chamber of Economy's council for
international economic cooperation Svetozar Krasin said the trade
with foreign countries over the past nine months was worth 3.914
billion U.S. dollars, of which Yugoslav exports accounted for
1.259 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The Yugoslav economy will be successfully incorporated into
world trade, as was indicated by the interest of foreign business
for economic cooperation with Yugoslav partners and numerous
visits by business leaders," the Tanjug news agency quoted Krasin
as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the possibilities and conditions for renewing, and even
for exceeding, the former volume of economic cooperation, have
been discussed by representatives of the Yugoslav economy with
partners from some 50 countries in Europe, Asia, Africa and South
America.
</P>
<P>
Referring to certain contacts, Krasin specified that Yugoslav
and Greek businessmen have concluded a deal to set up a joint firm
in Yugoslavia for the production of automobile tires and the
building of a plant for the production of ceramic tiles and
aluminum profiles.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav and Russian businessmen have recently signed contracts
for the purchase of equipment for the needs of the Yugoslav
metallurgy, the delivery of fireproof material for the needs of
Russian cement plants, and the joint production of railroad
passengers cars, Krasin said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China has concluded a three-year barter deal with
Yugoslavia, under which China will sell oil worth 350 million U.S.
dollars to Yugoslavia in exchange for Yugoslav products.

<HEADLINE> Britain, US to Resume Open Skies Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The British government said here
today that it is to resume the deadlocked open skies talks with
the United States next week in an effort to strike an aviation
agreement between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
A British Department of Transport official said today that
British negotiators would go to Washington on November 6 for a
two-day session with their American counterparts.
</P>
<P>
"They (the talks) are taking place at the U.S. request
following informal contacts after the last round of talks was
canceled" in August, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Fresh attempts at re-starting the open skies talks have
intensified recently with British Airways and American aviation
companies urging their governments to reach an aviation agreement
as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
British airline executives reportedly said that it was too
early to say whether London and Washington can reach agreement on
open skies at the coming round of talks.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between the two countries broke down in August as
the British resisted U.S. demands that its carriers be given the
right to fly to third countries from British airports, the
so-called "beyond rights."
</P>
<P>
British officials have repeatedly made it clear that Britain
would not grant "beyond rights" to any American passenger flights,
which allow U.S. carriers to fly within the European Union market,
while foreign airlines do not have the right to fly between two
points in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Washington has demanded an open skies agreement with Britain
before it gives the green light to the proposed alliance between
British Airways and the American Airlines, which is expected to
create the world's most powerful aviation partnership.
