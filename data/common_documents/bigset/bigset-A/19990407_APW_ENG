<HEADLINE> NRC Cites New England Power Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New England's largest utility was cited for  
violations Tuesday in discriminating against workers who raised 
safety concerns about Connecticut's Millstone nuclear power plant. 
But it escaped a fine. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission appointed an independent  
review team to review the discrimination cases in January after 
questions were raised about its own failure to punish the company 
earlier for actions against whistleblowers. 
</P>
<P>
	The review team found adequate evidence that Northeast  
Utilities' nuclear subsidiary, Northeast Nuclear Energy Company, 
discriminated against three workers in 1993 and 1995 for raising 
safety concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	There was not sufficient evidence of discrimination in a third  
case involving 1996 dismissals, it found. 
</P>
<P>
	The NRC, based on those findings, said the utility would receive  
a notice of violation for three violations to ensure that such 
discrimination is not repeated. 
</P>
<P>
	It also sent a notice of violation to a former utility vice  
president, who has since left the company, and letters of reprimand 
to four company managers. The identities of the managers are to be 
made public after they have had a chance to respond. 
</P>
<P>
	But while a ``civil penalty normally is considered for such  
significant violations,'' the NRC refrained from levying a fine 
because of the progress that the utility has made in handling 
employee concerns and creating a workplace environment that 
stresses safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The utility's history of harassing and intimidating  
whistleblowers contributed to an accumulation of safety problems 
that ultimately led to the shutdown of all three Millstone reactors 
in 1995 and 1996. One reactor has since returned to power. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, the NRC lifted an order requiring independent  
oversight of the utility's employee concerns program to guard 
against discrimination, harassment and intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
	Northeast Utilities serves 1.7 million people in Connecticut,  
Massachusetts and New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, the NRC's Office of Inspector General issued a  
report on the agency's handling of harassment and discrimination 
complaints made by 22 Millstone workers who were among 102 
employees fired in January 1996 as part of a cost-cutting 
reduction. 
</P>
<P>
	It found that NRC staffers, in December 1997, decided to take  
accelerated enforcement action against the utility based on 
evidence that a former vice president has discriminated against two 
or possibly three workers who raised safety concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	The company could have been subject to a fine of $100,000 or  
more, but the NRC's Office of Enforcement never followed through. 
Instead, the initial decision was dropped at a second enforcement 
conference meeting, and the inspector general did not find a 
written record of the reason for the change. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the independent review team reached a different  
conclusion, it did not criticize the NRC staffers' handling of the 
case. However, it recommended improvements to the agency's 
investigative and enforcement processes.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Accused of Rights Violations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Human rights watchdog Amnesty International on  
Wednesday showcased an alleged victim of American police brutality 
in an effort to strengthen its campaign against abuses in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Accusing the United States of ``persistent and widespread human  
rights violations,'' Amnesty has mounted a high-profile campaign to 
get the 53-nation U.N. Human Rights Commission to censure the 
Americans at its six-week annual session. 
</P>
<P>
	Shirley Alejos, a U.S. citizen of Puerto Rican origin, recounted  
her ordeal at the hands of Chicago police in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Alejos said she was coming home from church one night with her  
children, when she was stopped by police, who thought she was a 
teenager violating a curfew. When she tried to explain, police 
arrested her and took her to the station where they questioned her 
and began beating her. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they didn't like my answers they hit me,'' said Alejos, a  
92-pound mother of five. ``I was taken into a separate room and 
three police officers came in and started beating me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alejos said she was kept in a cell overnight and sent to a  
hospital the next day. She had a broken leg, two black eyes and 
bruises all over her body. She added that her family was still 
being harassed by the police. 
</P>
<P>
	Amnesty is citing police brutality as one of the key human  
rights violations in the United States. The country's justice and 
penal system also have glaring shortcomings according to Amnesty's 
Secretary-general Pierre Sane. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. delegation refuted the criticism.  
</P>
<P>
	``We disagree strongly that civil and human rights violations in  
the United States are persistent, widespread or, indeed, the 
implication that they go unpunished,'' U.S. delegation leader Nancy 
Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are proud of our political and judicial system. We have  
appropriate mechanisms in place to address shortcomings and are 
continually taking action against abuses wherever they occur.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the international trend toward abolishing capital  
punishment, more than 350 prisoners had been executed in the United 
States since 1990 with another 3,500 on death row, Sane said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said increasing numbers of asylum-seekers were being detained  
alongside common criminals and that female prisoners were victims 
of rape and abuse from male guards. 
</P>
<P>
	Amnesty, which traditionally targets China during the session,  
this year sparked controversy when it turned its focus to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Amnesty International is not putting the U.S.A. in the same  
league as China. It is the U.S.A. which is putting itself in that 
league,'' Sane said. ``Amnesty is doing nothing more than holding a 
mirror.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amnesty has lumped the United States with other countries such  
as Turkey, Algeria, Cambodia, Rwanda, Burundi and Congo, hoping to 
also focus the U.N. commission's attention on those countries.

<HEADLINE> Online Election Being Investigated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OGDEN, Utah (AP) -- Weber State University's legal staff is  
investigating the school's first ever online student elections, 
believing state or federal laws may have been broken. 
</P>
<P>
	Administrators say someone or some people fraudulently voted at  
least 40 times last week by using other students' Social Security 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	President Paul H. Thompson said WSU's legal counsel, computer  
experts and police officers are trying to find out if there was a 
misappropriation and unauthorized use of student ID numbers. They 
hope to conclude the investigation within a couple of days. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week students voted for half of the student body officers,  
including president and vice presidents, using their Social 
Security numbers through the university's Web page. The special 
constituency senators were voted on by paper ballots. 
</P>
<P>
	The final election was declared void Friday after about 30  
students reported not being able to vote because their ID numbers 
had already been used. 
</P>
<P>
	The school's staff looked at the computer voting patterns and  
found more discrepancies. 
</P>
<P>
	One off-campus computer was heavily used between midnight and 6  
a.m. The university called the students who reportedly cast their 
ballots on that computer and 10 said they had not voted, Thompson 
said. Other on-campus computers have similarly strange voting 
patterns and Thompson said the internal review could unearth more 
fraudulent votes.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes Equal Pay for Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton renewed his call Wednesday  
for equal pay for working women, saying the country has ``the 
opportunity of a generation'' to correct the inequity during good 
economic times. 
</P>
<P>
	The president, along with first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and  
Labor Secretary Alexis Herman, played host to a roundtable 
discussion with four women who related their battles to address 
salary disputes with lawsuits as well as on-the-job diplomacy. The 
event was held to commemorate Equal Pay Day on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are still those who claim that this is a made-up  
problem, that any wage gap between men and women can be explained 
away by the choices women make,'' Mrs. Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is still a sizeable gap between men's and women's  
salaries that can best be explained by one phenomenon: the 
continuing presence and the persistent effect of discrimination, 
sometimes in very subtle ways,'' said the first lady, who practiced 
law in Arkansas while her husband pursued his public service 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton -- who counted himself among ``a small but vocal radical  
caucus'' of husbands whose wives have outearned them -- said 
Congress should take advantage of the nation's low unemployment and 
booming economy and pass the Paycheck Fairness Act introduced last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would allow women to sue their employers for  
unlimited compensatory and punitive damages, in addition to the 
limited damages and back-pay awards now available under federal law 
to remedy pay violations. That would bring women on par with other 
minorities in wage discrimination matters. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's Council of Economic Advisers reported last year  
that women earn about 75 cents for every dollar a man earns, a 
narrower gap than in 1963, when President Kennedy signed the 
original Equal Pay Act. Then, women workers earned 58 cents for 
every dollar paid to male workers. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of his fiscal 2000 budget, Clinton has requested $14  
million for efforts to close the wage gap between men and women. 
</P>
<P>
	He wants $10 million for training Equal Employment Opportunity  
Commission employees to identify and respond to wage 
discrimination, and $4 million for a Department of Labor program to 
help contractors hire and promote women in non-traditional jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sonya Tyler, women's basketball coach at Howard University, said  
the greatest degrees of bias often are found in nontraditional 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
	She filed a Title IX complaint against the school in 1991 when  
she learned that the newly hired men's basketball coach was being 
paid four times more than she, based on professional basketball 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't really look at the comparison between he and I ...  
until I was told that I had not played in the NBA,'' Tyler said. 
``I'm not building NBA players, and neither are our men. What was 
happening wasn't fair. Once fair was not going to be addressed, ... 
I took them to the institution I thought they respected most, and 
that was the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A jury awarded Tyler $2.39 million. She is still coaching at  
Howard. She said her case has improved conditions for women coaches 
elsewhere, in terms of contracts, practice hours and lower 
coach-to-athlete ratios.

<HEADLINE> Nick Grippo -- Caterer to the Stars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Nick Grippo is a familiar face on the Hollywood party circuit.  
He's at star-studded wrap parties, celebrity birthdays, Beverly 
Hills society events and Oscar night galas. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeing celebrities in their homes -- getting ready for a party or  
eating a relaxed dinner with their families -- gives Grippo a 
glimpse into their personal lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``They do a lot of normal stuff. They have real lives, with  
families and kids. And they have to eat, just like everyone else,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Grippo is offering a glimpse into the kitchens and dining  
rooms of his celebrity clients with ``Hollywood Dish! Recipes, Tips 
&AMP; Tales of a Hollywood Caterer'' (Angel City Press, $29.95). 
</P>
<P>
	``People will probably buy my book because of the stories,''  
Grippo acknowledged. ``But the recipes really are good. I tried to 
pick recipes that are not complicated or intimidating. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of the recipes are 'comfort food.' Celebrities eat that  
kind of food too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grippo's only formal culinary training came when he was 11 and  
worked in his father's Chicago sandwich shop. 
</P>
<P>
	So most of his recipes have evolved over the years, with Grippo  
learning on the job. (When he is testing a new dish, he will eat it 
four nights in a row before serving it to friends.) 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Taylor, who wrote the book's foreword, particularly  
likes Grippo's Caesar salad with Parmesan croutons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rodeo Drive ribs'' and ``haute dogs'' were served at her  
Fourth of July barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
	At Barry Manilow's Thanksgiving dinner, the menu featured turkey  
and cornbread, sausage and mushroom stuffing, served with a 
cranberry, shallot and dried-cherry compote. For Harrison Ford's 
birthday party, the menu included poached salmon with dill sauce 
and coconut angel food cake. 
</P>
<P>
	Grippo also counts Patrick Swayze and Carrie Fisher among his  
clients. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-three years ago, Grippo left his home in Chicago and  
headed for Hollywood, hoping to see his face on the big screen. He 
enrolled in acting classes at Los Angeles City College and 
graduated from UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
	He got acting jobs in a series of ``forgettable movies.''  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, his reputation as a cook grew.  
</P>
<P>
	His apartment was often filled with friends from his acting  
classes, who enjoyed the recipes his mother taught him because she 
was worried that he would starve, living so far away from his big 
Italian family. 
</P>
<P>
	Those friends included Ted Danson, Michelle Pfeiffer and Cindy  
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Grippo got his first paying job as a caterer from Ms. Williams,  
who had just started work on ``Laverne &AMP; Shirley,'' which became a 
hit TV series. Since then, Ms. Williams has hired him on a regular 
basis. (He will cater her New Year's 2000 party.) 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Grippo's clients favor relatively simple but flavorful  
foods that take advantage of the fresh fruits and vegetables that 
Southern California has to offer. 
</P>
<P>
	But the food he serves is not the low-fat, low-flavor cuisine  
that one might imagine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Years ago, everyone thought Los Angeles' food was only for  
dieters -- fruit salad with a little Mexican food on the side,'' 
Grippo said. ``But 'California cuisine' now offers excellent 
dining.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gourmet Italian food is very popular at the moment, Grippo said.  
And that's fine with him; he's a caterer who loves a good olive 
oil. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of his celebrity clients -- like Ms. Fisher -- have shown  
talent in the kitchen. Grippo has taught cooking classes in her 
home. When Ms. Fisher learned of his longtime crush on Beverly 
D'Angelo, she invited the actress to join them in the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
	As it turned out, Ms. D'Angelo had a knack for using Parmesan  
cheese. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd never know whose head was going to come through that  
door,'' Grippo said.

<HEADLINE> Software Maker Sues Online Critics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANFORD, Fla. (AP) -- A software maker is suing seven  
unidentified people who wrote critical comments about the company 
on an Internet message board. 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix International Ltd. claims the rumors on the message  
board operated by Yahoo! Inc. defamed the company and caused its 
stock price to dip. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed March 19 in state circuit court at the  
Seminole County Courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix has issued subpoenas for Yahoo! records, demanding that  
the company disclose the names of the chat-room participants. 
Bahram Yusefzadeh, the company's chairman and chief executive, said 
Yahoo! was cooperating fully, although the individuals haven't yet 
been identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the messages, many of which are critical of Yusefzadeh,  
appear to be employees and former employees, the chairman said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Someone using the moniker ``johnboscarelli'' posted messages on  
Feb. 9 and 16 that said, ``not a single ex-manager from the company 
is on speaking terms with this Yusefzadeh character'' and ``the CEO 
isn't too sharp technically, has a huge ego and has a well-earned 
reputation for dealing dishonestly with his managers and business 
partners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the past 2 1/2 months, senior company officials have spent  
``enormous amounts of time'' defending the company from negative 
rumors, Yusefzadeh said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people have put this company under siege for some of the  
garbage put on this Yahoo! chatboard,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix makes software for the financial-services industry. Its  
stock traded this week for nearly $5, down from a 52-week high of 
$21.68. 
</P>
<P>
	Yusefzadeh owns about 1.4 million shares of the company, meaning  
his stake in Phoenix has dropped in value from $31 million to $7 
million during the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert V. Bolen, an analyst with J.C. Bradford &AMP; Co. in  
Nashville, Tenn., said the negative chat had damaged the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock lost one-third of its value on Jan. 13, when the  
company announced its fourth-quarter earnings would be 9 cents a 
share, less than half of the 20-cent projection. 
</P>
<P>
	But the stock has continued to slide since then, and there has  
been no other reasonable explanation, Bolen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The other defendants go under the monikers  
``readbetweenthelines,'' ``numbersguy--2000,'' ``PHXX--Loser,'' 
``EmployedThere,'' ``banker9999'' and ``Phoenix--Employee.''

<HEADLINE> Cronyism Blamed for CEO Paychecks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Carnival Corp. CEO Micky Arison sits on the compensation  
committee that created his nearly $6 million pay package. The CEO 
of Hillenbrand Industries and his uncle serve on a company 
compensation committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Conflicts of interest like these are too common across Corporate  
America, the AFL-CIO complained Wednesday in a report that blames 
cronyism for helping fuel skyrocketing executive paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
	In part due to spiraling stock options, the average CEO of a  
major corporation made $7.8 million, or 326 times more than the 
$24,000 earned by a typical American factory worker in 1997 -- a 
trend that is drawing mounting ire. In Germany, in contrast, the 
average CEO makes just 25 times the average worker's wage, 
according to the AFL-CIO. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the inscrutable Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan  
Greenspan took an unusual poke at executive compensation, saying in 
February that a lot of CEO pay is ``not directed to the value they 
are producing for their shareholders, who are paying the bill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Naming friends, relatives and business partners to compensation  
committees helps fatten pay stubs, many believe. 
</P>
<P>
	Keeping such committees independent is ``truly the first line of  
defense against inappropriate pay packages,'' said Ann Yerger, 
director of research at the powerful Council of Institutional 
Investors, an association of 100 of the nation's largest pension 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Many companies are trying to remove cronies from their  
compensation committees. For example, company lawyers and 
investment bankers aren't as prevalent on such panels, Ms. Yerger 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a step in the right direction,'' she said.  
``Unfortunately, there's room for improvement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The AFL-CIO agrees. ``CEO pay is clearly out of control and  
conflicted `country-club' boards are some of the main culprits,'' 
said Richard Trumka, AFL-CIO secretary-treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
	The AFL-CIO based its report on data from the Investor  
Responsibility Research Center, which found that nearly 150 
directors of companies on the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index had 
conflicts of interest. The Center studied the companies' 1998 and 
1999 proxy statements, which by law must report committee members' 
conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the companies cited in the report, however, saw no  
problem with their committee composition. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't think it poses any conflict of interest, or we  
wouldn't have him there,'' said Tim Gallagher, spokesman for 
Miami-based Carnival, referring to CEO Arison's slot on the 
compensation committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Hillenbrand Industries CEO W. August Hillenbrand serves on one  
of two company compensation committees: the body that decides if 
pay packages -- including his own -- are competitive, said David 
Robertson, human resources vice president at the hospital equipment 
and casket maker. 
</P>
<P>
	But when the committee decides matters related to the CEO,  
Hillenbrand excuses himself, said Robertson, adding ``he's in no 
way involved in any decision in any adjustments to his own 
salary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One academic has recently argued that cronyism doesn't lead to  
inflated CEO pay. Although abuse of position occurs, directors are 
under too much scrutiny to act unprofessionally, says Catherine 
Daily, a professor of management at Indiana University. 
</P>
<P>
	Her study of 194 Fortune 500 companies suggests that affiliated  
directors are not systematically ``more generous in awarding CEO 
compensation than more independent committees,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But many in Corporate America are concerned, saying CEOs have  
been too cozy too long with the men and women who decide their pay. 
</P>
<P>
	John Lauer, CEO of shipping company Oglebay Norton, has taken a  
stand on the issue by drawing no salary and getting a bonus capped 
at $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
	And although two members of the Cleveland company's compensation  
committee do business with the firm, he plans to forbid such 
connections when the two members step down. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has to be an absolutely clean (relationship), no  
friendship, no business deals,'' he said. ``I don't want any 
perception that we have any kind of a linkage that way.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Everglades Restoration Moved Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Army Corps of Engineers on Wednesday  
accelerated the pace of its ambitious plan to restore the Florida 
Everglades, which has been abused by agriculture and development 
over the last half-century. 
</P>
<P>
	The corps released a revised plan for its $7.8 billion  
Everglades project and speeded it up by 20 percent. That was a 
concession to environmentalists and scientists who said the 
original plan Vice President Al Gore announced in October was too 
slow. 
</P>
<P>
	``The greater Everglades ecosystem is nationally significant and  
unique in the world,'' the corps' report begins. ``If actions are 
not taken now, irretrievable loss of this extraordinary resource 
will occur.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The revised plan is to be formally handed over to Congress on  
July 1 after yet another review by the public and government 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The corps is essentially undoing the job it did a half-century  
ago, when it carved the canals and built the levees that rerouted 
water across South Florida. As it turned out, that put the 
Everglades in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan seeks a delicate balancing act: restoring traditional  
water flow through the Everglades to save bird and fish populations 
that have decreased in some species by 90 percent in the marshy 
estuaries and sawgrass prairies. 
</P>
<P>
	The corps must manage to do that while ensuring a future water  
supply for burgeoning South Florida and without flooding suburban 
developments that encroach upon the wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Many key components now will be completed by 2020 rather than  
2025. Forty-four of the plan's 68 components will be completed by 
2010. In the original plan, few projects were scheduled to be 
completed in the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The corps' report said the increased pace should not raise the  
total cost of the project.

<HEADLINE> Kissinger, Ueberroth Join IOC Panel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Henry Kissinger and Peter Ueberroth have  
accepted appointments to a panel that will rebuild the 
International Olympic Committee in the wake of its biggest scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said Wednesday that Kissinger, a former secretary of  
state, and Ueberroth, the chief organizer of the 1984 Los Angeles 
Olympics, agreed to serve among the two dozen members of IOC 2000, 
the committee's reform commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Also accepting appointment was Anita DeFrantz, an IOC vice  
president from Los Angeles, committee spokesman Franklin 
Servan-Schreiber said. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The  
Associated Press on Tuesday that IOC president Juan Antonio 
Samaranch had asked Kissinger, Ueberroth and DeFrantz to be on the 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
	A fourth American, U.S. Olympic Committee president Bill Hybl,  
was the first appointment to the commission last month. 
Servan-Schreiber said Italian industrialist Giovanni Agnelli also 
had accepted Samaranch's invitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Kissinger's New York office confirmed his acceptance but said he  
would have no further comment. Ueberroth and DeFrantz did not 
return messages left at their southern California offices. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch wants the commission to meet by early June, with an  
interim report presented to the IOC general assembly later that 
month in Seoul, South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC 2000 was set up last month as the committee's primary engine  
for change after the Salt Lake scandal, in which six members were 
expelled in a million-dollar gifts-for-votes scheme involving the 
Utah capital's successful quest for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission will have 20 to 24 members, half from the IOC and  
half ``leading personalities who understand sport,'' and 
essentially will come up with a new version of the Olympic Charter, 
the IOC's century-old bylaws. 
</P>
<P>
	It will study and make recommendations on selection of Olympic  
host cities, how IOC members are elected, term limits, structure 
and membership of the ruling executive board and further roles for 
Olympic athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel also will look at revenue sharing and the evolution of  
the games themselves.

<HEADLINE> Saints Want Ricky Williams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The New Orleans Saints want Ricky Williams  
and the Heisman Trophy winner would like to be a Saint. 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans is willing to trade every draft pick this year -- 11  
of them (a second-rounder was dealt to the Rams to get wide 
receiver Eddie Kennison) -- and throw in some picks from next year. 
Maybe even a couple of roster players if need be. 
</P>
<P>
	But Williams doesn't think that's enough to clinch the deal.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's going to happen,'' Williams said Thursday.  
``I want it to. Ideally for me, the Saints trade to No. 1 and I'm 
the No. 1 pick. But I'm pessimistic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams spent the afternoon being wooed by coach Mike Ditka,  
owner Tom Benson and general manager Bill Kuharich. It was the 
second stop of a three-day tour of six teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ditka's a great coach and I'd love to play for him,'' said  
Williams, although he admitted he was afraid of Ditka before 
meeting him, worried about the furious man he'd seen stalking the 
sidelines at games. 
</P>
<P>
	``But he's the nicest guy in the world,'' Williams said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Saints offense was 28th in the NFL last season and was dead  
last in the league in rushing. Williams said Ditka would like to 
change that with a running back who could do for him what Walter 
Payton did in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he likes to run the ball. He's not going to throw the  
ball around and turn it over. He's just going to run the ball,'' 
Williams said. ``They'll get mad at him and it'll be boring, but 
he'll win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints are scheduled to pick 12th in the first round. They  
have picks in every round except the second. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to get a feel for who would be interested in dropping  
down to the 12th spot,'' Kuharich said. ``In dropping down to that 
spot, you get a very different group of players than you get in the 
top 10.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cleveland Browns have the No. 1 pick, and while they are  
thought to be looking for a quarterback, Browns director of 
football operations Dwight Clark said Williams impressed him at a 
workout held Tuesday. Clark said Cleveland is the team New Orleans 
should talk to. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Saints want to make sure they get him, that's the place  
to go,'' Clark said. ``To me, you've got a great player with little 
knowns vs. a quarterback with a larger amount of unknowns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' agent agreed. Leland Hardy said he believed that,  
after seeing Williams on Tuesday, the Browns will need only about 
five seconds to make him the No. 1 pick on draft day. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is all about minimizing risk,'' Hardy said. ``Now you  
tell me, what's the greater risk, an unproven quarterback who might 
work out, or a proven running back who was the greatest college 
player in the history of the sport?'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Kuharich said if a deal can't be made with the Browns, that  
doesn't mean there won't be a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Browns are where we start, but that doesn't mean we have  
to go that high,'' Kuharich said. ``Speculation is that the first 
three teams will take quarterbacks. Of course, the closer you get 
to the sixth spot, the more problematic it becomes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams also went to St. Louis on Wednesday. He was going to  
Washington and Philadelphia today and heads to Cleveland and 
Indianapolis of Friday.

<HEADLINE> Wheat Down; Corn, Soybeans Up / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat futures retreated Wednesday on the Chicago  
Board of Trade, while corn and soybeans moved higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures fell amid concerns there will be continued delays  
in shipping aid to Russia because the NATO bombing of Russian ally 
Yugoslavia has strained relations with the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans gained despite the recent expectations that  
farmers will plant huge tracts of corn and soybeans this spring. 
Meantime, harvesting of bumper competing crops in Argentina and 
Brazil is proceeding with little disruption. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for May delivery fell 4 1/4 cents to $2.84 3/4 a bushel; May  
corn rose 1 1/2 cents to $2.17 3/4 a bushel; May oats rose 4 1/4 cents to 
$1.09 1/4 a bushel; May soybeans rose 2 1/4 cents to $4.80 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and livestock futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange amid perceptions supplies will be ample through the heavy 
summer grilling months. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle fell 0.38 cent to 64.92 cents a pound; May  
feeder cattle fell 0.42 cent to 73.55 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
fell 0.90 cent to 54 cents a pound; July pork bellies fell 1.22

<HEADLINE> USDA: Pork Board Too Close to Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A quasi-governmental board created to promote  
pork is too closely tied to the industry's trade association, the 
Agriculture Department's inspector general said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the audit found no evidence the National Pork Board misused  
dollars collected from farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our evaluation showed that the board basically used checkoff  
funds to finance pork promotion, research and consumer education 
projects,'' inspector general Roger Viadero wrote in an audit. 
</P>
<P>
	Hog farmers contribute 45 cents of every $100 of animal value  
for a federally-mandated checkoff fund. The money goes to the 
board, which later contracts promotion services through the 
National Pork Producers Council, the trade group. 
</P>
<P>
	While the audit did not find ``misuse or loss of checkoff  
funds,'' the report concluded the board ``has relinquished too much 
authority to its primary contractor,'' the council, and ``has 
placed the NPPC in a position to exert undue influence over board 
budgets and grant proposals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The board has awarded all program grants to the NPPC since  
1996,'' Viadero wrote, recommending the board take actions to 
``accomplish appropriate separation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Council officials said the inspector general's concerns were  
unwarranted. 
</P>
<P>
	``What really stands out about this report is that it shows we  
did nothing wrong,'' NPPC president John McNutt said during a 
teleconference with the board. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Viadero ``wants to dramatically change a well  
established and well functioning organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``An arm's length relationship does exist between the National  
Pork Board and the NPPC,'' said Greg Boerboom, a producer from 
Marshall, Minn., who is chairman of the board's budget committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The audit comes amid a movement by some pork producers for a  
referendum on whether the checkoff should be voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing separating the NPPC from the pork board except  
a couple of inches of Sheetrock. It says we're justified,'' Rhonda 
Perry, a Missouri organizer of the anti-checkoff effort, said about 
the audit. 
</P>
<P>
	The board rents space in the council's Des Moines, Iowa,  
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Perry said the group would announce next week it has enough  
signatures to force a vote on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The board, made up of 15 producers appointed by the agriculture  
secretary, was created by Congress 12 years ago to strengthen pork 
industry promotion. Last year, the program collected $47.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar programs are in place for everything from beef to  
almonds and cotton. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the problems cited in the audit is that the board, with  
its staff of two, is understaffed and too reliant on the council to 
handle its duties. 
</P>
<P>
	``The board's dependence on the NPPC to administer subcontracts  
and carry out much of the board's work resulted in a weakened 
accountability over contributed funds,'' the audit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspector general recommended that USDA officials work with  
the board to develop a plan to ``accomplish appropriate 
separation'' from NPPC, including providing sufficient staff and 
accountability checks.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Carson Daly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As the host of MTV's daily music-and-interview  
show, ``Total Request Live,'' veejay Carson Daly has what many 
young people consider to be one of the coolest jobs in the world. 
(For the uninitiated: veejay is to video jockey as deejay is to -- 
well, you get it.) 
</P>
<P>
	Daly, 25, is not too much of any one thing. He's funny, but very  
understated. He's smart, but not intimidating. He's good-looking, 
but he's not a pretty boy. Sitting in the veejay's chair in MTV's 
Times Square studios, Carson seems as interested in talking to 
Marilyn Manson as he is chatting with his viewers, who call in and 
say things like ``Play more 98 Degrees because they're hotties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Remember last year's veejay search? Spiky-haired Jesse Camp, all  
of 19, beat out 4,000 contestants and made MTV unpredictable and 
fun to watch. Camp told MTV, ``To be a veejay? C'mon! It's like 
being president of the United States, and MTV is my White House!'' 
</P>
<P>
	On April 17, finalists in MTV's Wanna Be a VJ Too Contest will  
go on the air with Daly for four hours. Viewers will pick the 
winner. Auditions were scheduled this week in Los Angeles and 
Chicago, and will be held in New York April 12-13. Twelve 
semifinalists will be selected: eight from New York, two from Los 
Angeles and two from Chicago. MTV will narrow the list to five 
finalists. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly came to MTV in 1997 after briefly studying theology and  
working as a radio deejay. 
</P>
<P>
	1. Are you going to miss Jesse Camp?  
</P>
<P>
	Daly: Yes, I'm going to miss his eating habits especially, like  
ketchup on coleslaw. He's just fun to watch eat. But I'm going to 
miss him primarily because he got such a green light here. I mean, 
he could do anything he wanted, and I lived through him. He runs 
100 percent on passion and passion only, almost to a fault. 
</P>
<P>
	2. Who was your favorite original MTV veejay?  
</P>
<P>
	Daly: I remember Martha Quinn more than anybody, mainly because  
my sister's name is Quinn. We did a 'Where are they now?' veejay 
thing and I got to meet all of them. They were my constant reminder 
of whether or not I should become an MTV veejay. Because the big 
thing is, well, look at them now. I never made a decision like 'No, 
I'm not going to become an MTV veejay because veejays do Noxzema 
commercials after and that's it.' I was like, 'I'll be happy to do 
anything.' 
</P>
<P>
	3. Any advice for the latest veejay search contestants?  
</P>
<P>
	Daly: Keep it real and and don't be scared. The first time I  
ever did anything on tape was my audition. MTV said, 'Here's a 
camera crew. Go out and toss to some videos.' And I thought, 'How 
difficult can that be?' I didn't know what it meant, but I didn't 
care. I wasn't nervous, I just thought, 'these people are going to 
like me for me, with all my stuttering and all my not looking 
good.' 
</P>
<P>
	4. Do you ever watch yourself on television?  
</P>
<P>
	Daly: Never. Never ever. I can't stand it.  
</P>
<P>
	5. For MTV's ``Celebrity Deathmatch,'' who would win if you  
paired Serena Altschul against Martha Quinn and Kurt Loder against 
Jesse Camp? 
</P>
<P>
	Daly: Serena would definitely win, and Kurt would win,  
absolutely.

<HEADLINE> GM's Sales Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- U.S. sales of cars and light trucks were up a  
surprisingly strong 8 percent last month, despite a 2 percent sales 
decline at General Motors Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	March sales capped a robust first quarter that exceeded industry  
expectations. First-quarter sales increased 11 percent, led by a 15 
percent rise in truck sales and a 7 percent improvement in car 
sales compared with the first three months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	GM blamed its lower-than-expected performance on a lean  
inventory of its hottest-selling vehicle, the full-size Chevrolet 
Silverado pickup. GM's car sales increased 1 percent, based on the 
daily sales rate, while sales of light trucks were off 6 percent 
from its strong performance in March 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't a bad performance, but when you look at the  
competition, they had a much better month than GM did,'' said 
analyst Greg Salchow of Roney &AMP; Co. on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy Roberts, GM's North American sales chief, said he had not  
seen such a strong quarter in a decade: ``It's really been a shock 
to all of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts noted that GM economists predicted sales industrywide  
this year would run between 15 million and 15.2 million light 
vehicles; in the first quarter, sales ran at a seasonally adjusted 
rate of 16.4 million. As a result, GM has updated its industry 
forecast to 15.7 million units for the year. Last year the industry 
sold 15.6 million cars and light trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It clearly is going to be a very strong year,'' said Mike  
DiGiovanni, GM's head of market research. ``We do see as we move 
into the latter half of the year and next year, some minor slowing 
in the industry because (the growth) is not sustainable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the past week, Ford Motor Co. reported its March U.S. sales  
were up 14 percent and DaimlerChrysler AG said its Chrysler unit 
posted a 17 percent improvement. Most major foreign automakers also 
reported strong gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately for GM, many buyers have been turning to Ford and  
Dodge dealers when they've been unable to get a new Silverado 
pickup equipped the way they want. The Silverado is all-new for 
1999, as is its GMC twin, the Sierra. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is virtually selling as fast as we can build it,'' Roberts  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though GM has plans to build 250,000 more trucks this year than  
last, that extra production has only recently begun to kick in. 
</P>
<P>
	While inventories of the more expensive Sierra are fine, GM says  
it has been unable to get stocks of the Silverado up to where it 
wants because of the strong demand. 
</P>
<P>
	GM also sold about 10,000 fewer pickups to business, government  
and rental fleet customers last month than it did in March 1998, as 
it focused on meeting more profitable retail orders. A total of 
53,097 Silverados and 20,042 Sierras were sold last month. 
</P>
<P>
	GM said it has an inventory of about 155,000 full-size pickups,  
but needs between 165,000 to 175,000 to meet dealer needs. About 
30,000 of the current inventory are in transit to dealers. Roberts 
said he expected inventories to reach adequate levels in about five 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts said GM also sold fewer of its compact pickups last  
month because it declined to match the level of sales incentives 
offered by its competition, opting for higher profits over 
increased market share. GM's compacts also lack four-door versions 
that some competitors offer. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's U.S. market share last month was 29.5 percent, down from  
29.7 percent in February but ahead of last year's strike-effected 
29.1 percent. GM has started the year with the goal of gaining 32 
percent of the market, but that's appearing unlikely.

<HEADLINE>  NATO Attacks Continue in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Dismissing President Slobodan  
Milosevic's unilateral cease-fire with ethnic Albanian rebels, NATO 
stepped up its airstrikes overnight, hitting military targets in 
Kosovo and inflicting heavy damage elsewhere in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Macedonia, meanwhile, emptied a border enclave where tens of  
thousands of Kosovo refugees had been trapped for days in squalid 
conditions. The country has sharply criticized the United States 
and its NATO allies for failing to anticipate the flood of refugees 
driven from Kosovo by Serb forces enraged over NATO's air campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	In Cyprus, the acting parliament speaker said today he was close  
to arranging the release of three American soldiers captured by the 
Yugoslav government. 
</P>
<P>
	Spyros Kyprianou said he will fly to Belgrade today to work for  
the release of the U.S. soldiers. He said his announcement followed 
``informal consultations'' over the past few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Staff Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles; Spc. Steven M.  
Gonzales, 21, of Huntsville, Texas; and Staff Sgt. Christopher J. 
Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich.; were captured last week near the 
Yugoslav-Macedonian border. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Berger, President Clinton's national security adviser,  
said he was aware of Kyprianou's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly would welcome the release of the three American  
soldiers but I can't confirm that is going to take place,'' Berger 
said on NBC's ``Today'' show. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, Air Marshal Sir John Day told reporters that the  
increasing intensity of the NATO air campaign against Serbian 
forces was continuing. 
</P>
<P>
	He said 10 Harrier jets attacked four sets of Serb military  
targets in Kosovo, including tanks and convoys of vehicles that 
were targeted with cluster bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said: ``Over the 15 days of  
the air campaign, some 190 attacks have been conducted. Over 80 of 
them have been in the last four days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NATO airstrikes late Tuesday and today followed a  
declaration by Milosevic's government of a unilateral cease-fire in 
its battle to crush rebels in Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's 
dominant republic, Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said the cease-fire, which began Tuesday evening,  
was to honor Orthodox Easter. It included an offer to forge a peace 
agreement with moderate ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, 
under which an estimated 500,000 Kosovars -- overwhelmingly ethnic 
Albanians -- could return home. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbian television said today that Western rejection of the  
unilateral cease-fire proved NATO's ``criminal intentions'' to 
impose foreign ``occupation'' troops on the country. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement from the Yugoslav army said the armed forces were  
abiding by the cease-fire and there was no military activity in the 
province except NATO attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the cease-fire declaration nor statements from Yugoslav  
officials said anything about holding fire against NATO forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the cease-fire went into effect, air raid sirens  
sounded in Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, and explosions were 
heard near a military airfield on the northern rim of the city. 
State-controlled media reported attacks on fuel depots and other 
targets throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Government media said targets included attacks today on a fuel  
storage facility at the airport near Pristina. Serbian TV said NATO 
wiped out a residential area near the old post office in central 
Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	``Undoubtedly there are dead and injured'' the television report  
said, but gave no further details. 
</P>
<P>
	A fuel depot in the village of Devet Jugovica and unspecified  
targets in Ajvalija and Gracanica on the outskirts of Pristina were 
also reported hit. 
</P>
<P>
	State television also said the garage and warehouse at an oil  
refinery in Novi Sad, Serbia's second largest city, were destroyed. 
The official Tanjug news agency said the industrial zone in the 
central Serbian city of Nis was attacked. 
</P>
<P>
	Western leaders denounced the Yugoslav cease-fire as a sham and  
pledged to press ahead with airstrikes until Milosevic accepts 
Western terms. They include withdrawal of Serb special police and 
military units from the province and a three-year interim autonomy 
agreement to be policed by 28,000 NATO-led troops, including 4,000 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslav government has rejected that formula, especially  
the presence of foreign troops. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>  NATO Attacks Continue in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Dismissing President Slobodan  
Milosevic's unilateral cease-fire with ethnic Albanian rebels, NATO 
stepped up its airstrikes overnight, hitting military targets in 
Kosovo and inflicting heavy damage elsewhere in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Macedonia, meanwhile, emptied a border enclave where tens of  
thousands of Kosovo refugees had been trapped for days in squalid 
conditions. The country has sharply criticized the United States 
and its NATO allies for failing to anticipate the flood of refugees 
driven from Kosovo by Serb forces enraged over NATO's air campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	In Cyprus, the acting parliament speaker said today he was close  
to arranging the release of three American soldiers captured by the 
Yugoslav government. 
</P>
<P>
	Spyros Kyprianou said he will fly to Belgrade today to work for  
the release of the U.S. soldiers. He said his announcement followed 
``informal consultations'' over the past few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Staff Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles; Spc. Steven M.  
Gonzales, 21, of Huntsville, Texas; and Staff Sgt. Christopher J. 
Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich.; were captured last week near the 
Yugoslav-Macedonian border. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Berger, President Clinton's national security adviser,  
said he was aware of Kyprianou's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly would welcome the release of the three American  
soldiers but I can't confirm that is going to take place,'' Berger 
said on NBC's ``Today'' show. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, Air Marshal Sir John Day told reporters that the  
increasing intensity of the NATO air campaign against Serbian 
forces was continuing. 
</P>
<P>
	He said 10 Harrier jets attacked four sets of Serb military  
targets in Kosovo, including tanks and convoys of vehicles that 
were targeted with cluster bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said: ``Over the 15 days of  
the air campaign, some 190 attacks have been conducted. Over 80 of 
them have been in the last four days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NATO airstrikes late Tuesday and today followed a  
declaration by Milosevic's government of a unilateral cease-fire in 
its battle to crush rebels in Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's 
dominant republic, Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said the cease-fire, which began Tuesday evening,  
was to honor Orthodox Easter. It included an offer to forge a peace 
agreement with moderate ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, 
under which an estimated 500,000 Kosovars -- overwhelmingly ethnic 
Albanians -- could return home. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbian television said today that Western rejection of the  
unilateral cease-fire proved NATO's ``criminal intentions'' to 
impose foreign ``occupation'' troops on the country. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement from the Yugoslav army said the armed forces were  
abiding by the cease-fire and there was no military activity in the 
province except NATO attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the cease-fire declaration nor statements from Yugoslav  
officials said anything about holding fire against NATO forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the cease-fire went into effect, air raid sirens  
sounded in Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, and explosions were 
heard near a military airfield on the northern rim of the city. 
State-controlled media reported attacks on fuel depots and other 
targets throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Government media said targets included attacks today on a fuel  
storage facility at the airport near Pristina. Serbian TV said NATO 
wiped out a residential area near the old post office in central 
Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	``Undoubtedly there are dead and injured'' the television report  
said, but gave no further details. 
</P>
<P>
	A fuel depot in the village of Devet Jugovica and unspecified  
targets in Ajvalija and Gracanica on the outskirts of Pristina were 
also reported hit. 
</P>
<P>
	State television also said the garage and warehouse at an oil  
refinery in Novi Sad, Serbia's second largest city, were destroyed. 
The official Tanjug news agency said the industrial zone in the 
central Serbian city of Nis was attacked. 
</P>
<P>
	Western leaders denounced the Yugoslav cease-fire as a sham and  
pledged to press ahead with airstrikes until Milosevic accepts 
Western terms. They include withdrawal of Serb special police and 
military units from the province and a three-year interim autonomy 
agreement to be policed by 28,000 NATO-led troops, including 4,000 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslav government has rejected that formula, especially  
the presence of foreign troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia, a Yugoslav ally, welcomed the cease-fire declaration.  
``Any peace initiative must be useful,'' spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin 
quoted President Boris Yeltsin as saying. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> World Bank: Global Crisis May Go On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The World Bank predicted Wednesday the global  
financial crisis may last longer than expected despite recent signs 
of recovery in Asia and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank, in a report assessing worldwide financial conditions,  
expressed concern about the possibility of protectionist trade 
policies if the U.S. economy falters, European markets fail to 
revive and Japan's recession deepens. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although there have been some encouraging signs of late with  
respect to recovery in Asia and in Brazil, we view this crisis as 
not over yet and we anticipate it will be more protracted and 
deeper '' than previously expected, said Uri Dadush, a senior bank 
official. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the bank wanted to warn against complacency as economies  
in Asia, where the crisis began 21 months ago, start to bounce 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	In Brazil, where the crisis spread late last year, stock markets  
are surging, the currency is stronger, inflation is lessening and 
investors are returning. 
</P>
<P>
	Dadush said the world economic growth ``has become extremely  
dependent on domestic demand in the United States,'' including a 
surging stock market. He described this dependence as ``not a 
healthy situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bank predicted that growth in the world's gross domestic  
product would rise by 1.8 percent, compared with 1.9 percent in 
1998. A 2.4 percent growth rate was forecast for 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said average growth rate in developing countries will  
be 1.5 percent in 1999, the lowest since 1982, and down from 1.9 
percent in 1998 and 4.8 percent in 1997. The bank predicted a 3.6 
percent increase in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank's sober forecast reflects declining trade growth,  
slumping prices for oil and other commodities, and a plunge in 
private, short-term capital investment to emerging economies, from 
$136 billion in 1997 to $72 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Lending by international financial institutions such as the bank  
and its sister institution, the International Monetary Fund, has 
increased. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank estimated that between July 1997, when the crisis  
began, and last December, the international community made 
available $190 billion in loans to Thailand, South Korea, 
Indonesia, Russia and Brazil. The countries have used $63 billion 
of that total.

<HEADLINE> Mich. Mayor Arrested on Sex Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT HURON, Mich. (AP) -- A mayor known for his colorful persona  
and volunteer work has been arrested on sexual misconduct charges 
involving two young girls. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerald ``Ajax'' Ackerman was charged with criminal sexual  
conduct and attempted criminal sexual conduct after the parents of 
both girls complained about him, Police Chief William Corbett said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Corbett would not elaborate on the charges.  
</P>
<P>
	Ackerman, 42, was jailed pending arraignment. Corbett said  
Ackerman had not yet hired a lawyer who could comment. Ackerman and 
his wife have an unlisted phone number. 
</P>
<P>
	Ackerman is a former drug and alcohol addict who is known for  
his long beard and hair, and two earrings in his left ear. He goes 
by his nickname -- named for Ajax in ``The Warriors,'' a movie about 
street gangs -- rides a Harley-Davidson and wears leather biker 
duds. 
</P>
<P>
	He has worked part-time as an aide at a mental health center,  
runs his own youth and adult center and volunteers at an HIV/AIDS 
clinic and a runaway shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, the National Association of Social Workers named  
Ackerman the Michigan Public Citizen of the Year for his work in 
the community. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been mayor of Port Huron, a city of 37,000 people 50  
miles northeast of Detroit, since 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayoral post is mostly ceremonial, as Port Huron has a  
city-manager form of government. The City Council candidate with 
the most votes is appointed mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	While nothing in the city charter calls for a mayor's removal  
because of felony charges, some council members wondered if 
Ackerman will be able to perform his duties while defending 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes everything so difficult. This city's got business to  
take care of,'' said Mayor Pro Tem Steven Miller, who would serve 
in Ackerman's absence.

<HEADLINE> NRC Cites New England Power Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New England's largest utility was cited for  
violations Tuesday in discriminating against workers who raised 
safety concerns about Connecticut's Millstone nuclear power plant. 
But it escaped a fine. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission appointed an independent  
review team to review the discrimination cases in January after 
questions were raised about its own failure to punish the company 
earlier for actions against whistleblowers. 
</P>
<P>
	The review team found adequate evidence that Northeast  
Utilities' nuclear subsidiary, Northeast Nuclear Energy Company, 
discriminated against three workers in 1993 and 1995 for raising 
safety concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	There was not sufficient evidence of discrimination in a third  
case involving 1996 dismissals, it found. 
</P>
<P>
	The NRC, based on those findings, said the utility would receive  
a notice of violation for three violations to ensure that such 
discrimination is not repeated. 
</P>
<P>
	It also sent a notice of violation to a former utility vice  
president, who has since left the company, and letters of reprimand 
to four company managers. The identities of the managers are to be 
made public after they have had a chance to respond. 
</P>
<P>
	But while a ``civil penalty normally is considered for such  
significant violations,'' the NRC refrained from levying a fine 
because of the progress that the utility has made in handling 
employee concerns and creating a workplace environment that 
stresses safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The utility's history of harassing and intimidating  
whistleblowers contributed to an accumulation of safety problems 
that ultimately led to the shutdown of all three Millstone reactors 
in 1995 and 1996. One reactor has since returned to power. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, the NRC lifted an order requiring independent  
oversight of the utility's employee concerns program to guard 
against discrimination, harassment and intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
	Northeast Utilities serves 1.7 million people in Connecticut,  
Massachusetts and New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, the NRC's Office of Inspector General issued a  
report on the agency's handling of harassment and discrimination 
complaints made by 22 Millstone workers who were among 102 
employees fired in January 1996 as part of a cost-cutting 
reduction. 
</P>
<P>
	It found that NRC staffers, in December 1997, decided to take  
accelerated enforcement action against the utility based on 
evidence that a former vice president has discriminated against two 
or possibly three workers who raised safety concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	The company could have been subject to a fine of $100,000 or  
more, but the NRC's Office of Enforcement never followed through. 
Instead, the initial decision was dropped at a second enforcement 
conference meeting, and the inspector general did not find a 
written record of the reason for the change. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the independent review team reached a different  
conclusion, it did not criticize the NRC staffers' handling of the 
case. However, it recommended improvements to the agency's 
investigative and enforcement processes.

<HEADLINE> Mystery Winner in $197M Jackpot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- They know the hour the winning ticket was  
purchased, the store where it was bought and how much it's worth. 
</P>
<P>
	Now lottery officials are wondering who holds the ticket to the  
$197 million Big Game pot, the second-largest lottery prize in U.S. 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Someone's sitting in their lawyer's office right now, you can  
imagine that, or the accountant's office, probably their travel 
agent's office as well,'' said Treasurer Shannon O'Brien, who 
oversees the state lottery. 
</P>
<P>
	The mystery winner, who beat the 76 million-to-1 odds that had  
eluded the buyers of 328 million tickets since February, has a year 
to claim the prize. 
</P>
<P>
	The pot can be taken in a lump sum of about $70.2 million after  
taxes, or in 26 annual payments of about $5.1 million after taxes. 
The game is played in Massachusetts, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, 
Michigan and Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	The golden ticket -- numbers 12, 17, 22, 33, and 44 with the Big  
Money Ball of 25 -- was purchased Tuesday night at Star Market near 
Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just pure excitement here,'' said Linda Marino, assistant  
store manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoppers had lined up 15 people deep Tuesday waiting to buy  
tickets at the peak hours between 5-8 p.m. The winner was sold 
about 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we're waiting to see who won the money. Hopefully, an  
employee,'' Marino said. 
</P>
<P>
	The country's biggest jackpot was Powerball's $295 million prize  
in July. A group of 13 Ohio machinists, dubbed the Lucky 13, pooled 
their money and ended up sharing the prize.

<HEADLINE> Suzuki Buys Into General Motors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's Suzuki Motor Corp. has acquired a stake of  
less than 1 percent in U.S. automaker General Motors Corp. to 
strengthen an existing alliance between the two companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Suzuki has bought 500,000 shares of GM, representing a 0.7  
percent stake in the world's largest carmaker, for about $37 
million, a Suzuki spokesman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Last September, GM announced it would increase its stake in  
Suzuki to 10 percent, and Suzuki's acquisition the American 
company's shares is intended to bolster their partnership, 
according to the spokesman, who spoke on condition that he not be 
identified by name. 
</P>
<P>
	The two carmakers already have a joint venture in Canada and  
have been increasing coordination of their global manufacturing 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Suzuki has primary responsibility for the design and development  
of small passenger vehicles, particularly in Asia. U.S.-based GM is 
responsible for midsize and large passenger vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Suzuki is Japan's largest manufacturer of mini-vehicles and the  
world's third biggest motorcycle maker. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement comes amid a wave of global consolidation  
within the auto industry. Last month, France's Renault acquired a 
36.8 percent stake in Japan's ailing Nissan Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, a newspaper reported that Japan's Mitsubishi  
Motor Co. and Mazda Motor Co., which is controlled by U.S. carmaker 
Ford, are in negotiations to form a broad technological alliance.

<HEADLINE> Ripken Misses Start Due to Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- For the first time since 1982, Cal Ripken  
missed a game because of injury Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, who left the Baltimore Orioles' season opener Monday in  
the third inning with stiffness in his lower back, watched 
Wednesday night's 8-5 loss to Tampa Bay from the dugout while 
Willis Otanez took over at third base. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could beat my head against the wall and go do it today, but  
it doesn't make sense,'' Ripken said. ```We're going to just work 
toward being ready tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last Sept. 20, Ripken voluntarily ended his record streak of  
playing in 2,632 games by sitting out the Orioles' final home game 
against the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, his absence was not by choice.  
</P>
<P>
	``He told me was 90 percent better and I told him I'd rather err  
on the side of caution and give him another 24 hours,'' manager Ray 
Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my heart I know he never played a game just because of the  
streak. Fortunately for us it's not there anymore, so we can use a 
little better judgment,'' Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the streak were still alive, it probably would have come to a  
dramatic conclusion Wednesday night. Ripken, 38, removed himself 
from Monday's game because his back locked up, leaving him unable 
to continue. 
</P>
<P>
	Although his back felt much better Wednesday, it was far from  
perfect. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it was 90 percent, playing would be a no-brainer,'' Ripken  
said. ``Every situation is different, but I doubt I'd play tonight 
regardless if the streak was still alive. ... I want to be able to 
contribute this whole season, and it wouldn't make sense to push it 
just to play one game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Ripken missed a game because of injury was in May  
1982 after he got beaned by Oakland rookie Mike Moore. His record 
streak began later that month and survived two ankle injuries, a 
twisted knee and a herniated disk in his back in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	None of those injuries affected him the way his injury did  
Monday, when he was rendered helpless by stiffness, tightness and 
spasms in his lower back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't consider myself superhuman. But I never reached a  
point where I couldn't play until the other day,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Orioles shortstop Mike Bordick expected it might be a bit  
strange when he looked to his right and didn't see Ripken standing 
there at third base. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's surprising not to see his name in the lineup. Everyone  
just expects that name to be written in,'' Bordick said. 
``Obviously he must be hurting. For him to come out of a game the 
other day the way he did, he obviously must be in some pretty good 
pain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Otanez was just happy to get a chance to play. When Ripken sat  
out last year's game against the New York Yankees, Ryan Minor 
manned third base. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice for me, I was happy to see I'm playing,'' he said.  
``But I don't want my teammate to get hurt like that. That's not 
good. I hope he gets well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Otanez doubled and hit his first major league homer.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Celtic Great Reflects on Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- His opinions were as plentiful as his  
characteristic cackles. Bill Russell was back in Boston and, as he 
did in his playing days, made his presence felt. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been 30 years since he left the NBA with his 11th title in  
13 seasons with the Celtics, but he still watches plenty of 
basketball -- as many as three games a day on television -- and 
doesn't like everything he sees. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I have a complaint, which I don't usually have because I  
like the game, I think the coaches are in charge, and so there is 
no creativity among the players, not very much anyway,'' he said 
Wednesday night before Boston's 108-87 win over Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to see creativity,'' he added. ``I like to think when I  
was a young player I was very creative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the center known for his intensity and defense has been  
impressed with another aspect of the modern players' performances. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing to watch people with that much money work that  
hard,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Then his face broadened into a wide grin and he laughed  
heartily. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell, who lives on the West Coast, made a rare appearance at  
a Celtics game to promote The Bill Russell Tribute scheduled for 
May 26 at the FleetCenter, adjacent to the site of the old Boston 
Garden and the team's home for the fourth year. 
</P>
<P>
	His No. 6 will be re-retired at an evening of entertainment,  
with a cast scheduled to include Bill Cosby, Aretha Franklin, 
Muhammad Ali, Wilt Chamberlain, Hank Aaron, Julius Erving and NBA 
commissioner David Stern. 
</P>
<P>
	That number originally was retired on March 12, 1972 with, as  
Russell desired, much less fanfare. He and his former coach, Red 
Auerbach, tugged on the ropes that raised the banner to the Boston 
Garden rafters one Sunday morning before any fans entered for an 
afternoon game. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell, one of the NBA's greatest players, couldn't understand  
what the fuss was about. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still don't particularly like awards and things, because I  
always felt I was just doing what I was supposed to do,'' he said. 
``I had the same reaction when they wanted to put me in the Hall of 
Fame. I just never liked that kind of thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he agreed to the May 26 ceremony, in part, because proceeds  
will go to The National Mentoring Partnership and the Mass 
Mentoring Partnership, a state organization. 
</P>
<P>
	And he wants his ex-teammates to know ``it does me honor to be  
on a banner with them,'' he said. ``I don't think there's any place 
on the planet (with) a better group of men than the guys I played 
with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He shared plenty of other opinions:  
</P>
<P>
	--''The old Garden was really a dump,'' he said. ``This new  
building is quite sterile, but then the Garden did have character, 
and rats. But this is a nice building.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--If the young Celtics, 11-22 and almost certain to miss the  
playoffs, ``can be patient and keep those guys together and ... 
realize that the better the guy next to you plays the better you 
are,'' they will improve. 
</P>
<P>
	--With teams playing illegal defenses, pro basketball ``is a  
little dull sometimes'' and he blames the coaches' tactics for 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	--He starts watching NBA games at 4:30 p.m. on the West Coast and  
often sees three in a row, ``but I stop to watch Jeopardy,'' he 
said with another laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	How does he do?  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm OK,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He usually was. After all, he averaged 22.5 rebounds per game  
for his career and was named the NBA's greatest player in 1980 by 
the Professional Basketball Writers' Association of America. 
</P>
<P>
	And as a player-coach with Boston, Russell won titles in two of  
his three seasons after first telling Auerbach he didn't want to 
succeed him. 
</P>
<P>
	How did he explain his change of heart to Auerbach?  
</P>
<P>
	``That's the one time I could make sure that I have a coach I  
like as much as I like you,'' he recalled, ``maybe more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then he laughed again.

<HEADLINE> Milstein Withdraws Redskins Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Heated emotion and the cold reality of finances  
spelled doom for Howard Milstein. Now the search is on -- again -- 
for a new owner for the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	Milstein, saying he wanted to get out before the process got  
``protracted'' and ``contentious'' when it was already both, 
withdrew his group's $800 million bid to buy the Redskins on 
Wednesday as it became apparent his group lacked the necessary 
support from NFL owners. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have withdrawn with great sadness. ... In the end we  
complied with all the league's stated requirements and agreed to 
all of the league's additional conditions,'' Milstein said in a 
statement released at a special owners meeting. ``But we recognize 
that a protracted, contentious dispute over ownership would cripple 
the Redskins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milstein's bid, which would have set a record for a U.S. sports  
franchise, was dogged from the start over questions about his 
finances and concerns he would be a litigious, maverick owner. 
Although worth an estimated $500 million, Milstein has his fortune 
tied up in real estate and did not have enough ready cash on hand 
to satisfy many owners. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Milstein got his father to supply $125 million for  
the deal, but many NFL owners viewed that as a loan rather than as 
liquid capital from the buyer. In a crucial vote, the league's 
finance committee met for 4 1/2 hours Wednesday morning and did not 
recommend approval of the sale, splitting 3-3 with one abstention. 
Without a positive recommendation, the sale was virtually certain 
not to get the 24 of 31 votes needed from the full ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	Milstein, a New York real estate developer and part-owner of the  
NHL's Islanders, then briefly addressed the full ownership. He made 
his case one final time before offering to pull out under an 
agreement brokered with input from commissioner Paul Tagliabue. 
Milstein left the room, and the owners voted 28-2-1 to accept the 
withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, Milstein promised not to sue the league. In  
return, the league agreed to assume responsibility for a 
non-refundable $30 million deposit Milstein was required to make 
when his bid was selected by the trustees of the estate of the late 
Jack Kent Cooke on Jan. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	However, as owners left the hotel, it quickly became clear money  
wasn't the only thing at issue. Tagliabue said some owners were 
concerned about Milstein's confrontational stewardship of the 
Islanders, who are involved in multiple lawsuits in a fight for a 
new arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``Emotion may have gotten invovled in it to some degree,'' said  
Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who supported the bid. ``They did 
have past experience, and I think some of those issues were 
perceived negatively, fairly or unfairly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finance committee chairman Bob Kraft, owner of the New England  
Patriots and another supporter of the bid, said a number of owners 
found the concept of the $30 million deposit ``quite offensive'' 
because it almost boxed the league into a corner. 
</P>
<P>
	``The method the trustees used to sell the team sort of picked  
our owner for us,'' Kraft said. ``The owners want to feel that 
we're picking who our new partner is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There will now be a new round of bidding conducted by the  
trustees. Milstein's minority partner, Washington-area 
communications executive Daniel Snyder, intends to be first in line 
-- this time at the person leading the group. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dan Snyder intends to own the Washington Redskins,'' said a  
source involved with Snyder's planning. ``There are no shortage of 
partners willing to be involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder, who would become the league's youngest owner at age 34,  
has more than $150 million cash available to mount a bid and left a 
positive impression with many NFL owners. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's logical,'' Jones said of a Snyder bid, ``because he was a  
very positive and important part of this bid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Snyder nor Milstein was available for comment after the  
withdrawal was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Also re-entering the race will be Redskins president John Kent  
Cooke, son of the late owner. Cooke vowed to keep the team in his 
family, but was outbid by an estimated $120 million in the first 
round. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today I have notified executors of my father's estate that my  
offer is still on the table,'' Cooke said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new round of bidding could be completed in about two months.  
Meanwhile, Cooke will continue to run the team, retaining coach 
Norv Turner and general manager Charley Casserly.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farzad Naeim, an earthquake engineer from Los  
Angeles who decided to go to law school, didn't have time for 
campus meetings and classroom lectures. So when Kaplan's Concord 
Law School was launched last fall, Naeim enrolled to get his 
education through the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I figure if I go to a standard school four nights a week, that  
eliminates the chance for me to see my kids grow up,'' said Naeim, 
44. ``I get my assignments off the computer, and I can study after 
the kids go to bed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of universities are launching courses or degree  
programs online. But a pair of reports being released today 
question whether a seat in front of a computer is as good as a seat 
in a college classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	The reports' complaints range from whether the programs'  
effectiveness is evaluated properly and whether they cost too much 
to whether they are unfair to certain students. 
</P>
<P>
	The College Board warns in its report that Internet courses  
could hinder the progress of poor and minority students who arrive 
at college with less exposure to computers than white or 
more-affluent students. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's this rush to get online and go virtual. ... Colleges,  
policy-makers and (Internet) providers who are driving this market 
need to think about broad access,'' Larry F. Gladieux, a senior 
College Board researcher, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A second report, by the Institute for Higher Education Policy,  
says colleges still lack enough knowledge about Internet-based 
education to justify its rapid growth. For example, studies haven't 
explained a higher dropout rate for Internet-based learners -- 32 
percent compared with 4 percent for classroom students in one study 
-- or looked at whether students do better from Internet instruction 
alone or from a mix of Internet and classroom learning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of the studies suggest the grades of distance learners  
are higher or comparable,'' said Jamie Merisotis, president of the 
institute, which did the study for two teachers' unions. ``We don't 
know whether the poorer performers are dropping out at a higher 
rate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, 26,000 courses online teach roughly 750,000 students.  
They include the online law school and courses at Stanford 
University, the University of California, Los Angeles, and Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	The most visible advance, supporters say, is the first-time  
accreditation of a wholly online school: Students at Jones 
International University, operated out of Denver, now have such 
privileges as transferring credits and earning employer tuition 
reimbursements. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wondered if I was going to get a quality education,'' said  
Joan Crittenden, a Navy safety official from Waldorf, Md., who 
received her master's degree in business communications from Jones 
in December. ``I actually think I did get a better education. More 
of the resources were at my fingertips.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Distance learning started with classes taken by mail or by  
watching teachers' lectures on videos or cable television. But 
unlike correspondence school or video-lecture predecessors, 
Internet-based distance learning has a place on campus, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Deborah Everhart, a medieval studies professor at Georgetown  
University, holds classes off- and online, and says professors who 
have mastered e-mail now use Web pages to post course readings, 
homework and bulletin boards where students can leave messages. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are students I might not ordinarily hear from in  
class,'' Everhart said. ``But in a chat room, they feel freer to 
state their opinions and ask their questions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matthew Pittinsky is a co-founder of Washington-based Blackboard  
Inc., which creates and maintains Internet sites for college 
courses. ``There's no question, there is a market,'' Pittinsky 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Colleges' reliance on technology marketed by Blackboard, Real  
Education of Denver and Convene in San Francisco has led to 
criticism that the ventures are more about higher profits than 
higher learning. 
</P>
<P>
	College officials worried over enrollment increases and budget  
cuts could be easily seduced by pitches that virtual learning cuts 
the costs of ``bricks and mortar'' learning, College Board's 
Gladieux said. 
</P>
<P>
	But they need to ensure equal access, he said, noting that a  
technological divide still exists. For example, computers are in 75 
percent of households with incomes over $75,000, but just 20 
percent of households making less than $15,000 have computers or 
daily access. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Rosen of Kaplan notes that a law degree from Kaplan's  
Concord Law School costs up to $21,000, including the cost of a 
computer, rather than $80,000 for a more traditional law school. 
</P>
<P>
	``Online education has the potential to close a lot of the gaps  
that exist right now,'' Rosen said.

<HEADLINE> Novelist in Posthumous Opera Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- More than three years after his death, renowned  
Canadian novelist Robertson Davies makes his opera debut as 
librettist for a world-premiere production based on an ancient 
Roman tale. 
</P>
<P>
	Davies' adaptation of the ``The Golden Ass'' was his last work,  
completed shortly before he died at 82 in December 1995. He helped 
pick the composer and was a personal friend of the director, but 
never had a chance to hear the full score or see the show take 
shape. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact the score, by composer Randolph Peters, didn't get  
finished until a few weeks before rehearsals began at the Canadian 
Opera Company on March 5. The opera will be performed April 13. 
</P>
<P>
	It represents one of the company's most ambitious attempts to  
present a brand-new opera with predominantly Canadian origins and 
personnel. At a cost of $1.2 million, it is the most expensive 
opera commissioned by the company in two decades and has a huge 
entourage, including a 55-member orchestra, 40-member chorus and 
eight dancers for a ballet scene that Davies insisted upon. 
</P>
<P>
	Davies, considered by many to be the most accomplished Canadian  
novelist of all time, was an actor in his youth, an enthusiastic 
pianist and a lifelong opera lover. 
</P>
<P>
	As far back as 1989, the Canadian Opera Company's executive  
director, Richard Bradshaw, urged Davies to write a libretto. 
</P>
<P>
	The author initially demurred, but admitted -- when the topic was  
raised again six years later -- that he had in fact been toying with 
the idea of an opera adapted from a nearly 2,000-year-old Roman 
tale, ``The Golden Ass,'' by Apuleius. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the story of a handsome, hedonistic man named Lucius whose  
curiosity about magic leads to his transformation into a donkey, 
with subsequent misadventures as he tries to earn back his human 
shape. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradshaw, who will conduct ``The Golden Ass,'' said Davies  
``knew his marquee value'' and set his sights high when the early 
discussions of the project turned to a composer. Davies would have 
wanted Leonard Bernstein, had he still been alive, and encouraged 
preliminary contacts with Andre Previn, who was occupied with his 
``A Streetcar Named Desire'' opera project, Bradshaw said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradshaw had his own idea. He sent part of Davies' libretto to  
Randolph Peters, asked for some samples of music, then had the 
compositions played for Davies, who was delighted. That clinched 
the composing job for Peters, whose previous work, ``Nosferatu,'' 
was a Canadian Opera Company world premiere in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The experimental ``Nosferatu'' score received mixed reviews, and  
Bradshaw says Peters' work for ``The Golden Ass'' is likely to 
resonate more warmly with audiences. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's witty, it's bright,'' Bradshaw said. ``We thought in  
places there should be a very strong underlying jazz element.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As director, Bradshaw recruited Colin Graham, a U.S.-based  
Briton who was a friend of Davies. Graham has directed more than 50 
productions of new operas, including many of the works of Benjamin 
Britten as well as Previn's ``Streetcar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradshaw says Graham had the confidence to make some changes in  
the original libretto, even explaining his revisions to Davies' 
wife, Brenda. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Davies, a former actress, has attended some of the  
rehearsals and is expected to receive a tribute on opening night. 
</P>
<P>
	The cast is mostly Canadian, although the role of Lucius will be  
sung by American tenor Kevin Anderson. The choreography is by Debra 
Graham, long associated with the Montreal-based Cirque du Soleil. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradshaw sees the whole project as a gamble, and will consider  
himself a winner if ``The Golden Ass'' is sought by other 
companies. Directors or managers are coming to the premiere from 
top opera companies in the United States, Britain and France. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to us that it go elsewhere,'' Bradshaw said.  
``Everyone is looking for the new opera that works. We need a 
20th-century opera that enters the repertoire.''

<HEADLINE>  Neil Armstrong Launches First Pitch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Neil Armstrong isn't much for public appearances,  
but the space pioneer made an exception for the start of the 
Astrodome's farewell baseball season. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, among 23 astronauts who simultaneously threw out  
ceremonial first pitches when the Astrodome opened April 12, 1965, 
did the job solo today before Houston's opener against the Chicago 
Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I called him, and he said, `I don't do public events,' ''  
Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr. said. Armstrong, fiercely 
protective of his privacy in recent years, relented after McLane 
explained the historic significance of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be club's 35th and final season in the Astrodome, the  
world's first indoor stadium. Next April, the Astros will move into 
a new retractable-roof ballpark downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	Acting as de facto spokesman for Armstrong, who rarely does  
interviews, McLane said Armstrong was a fixture at Colt .45s and 
Astros games when he lived in the area for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	``He loved living in Houston. He had such a great experience  
living here,'' said McLane, who was host to the Ohio native in his 
field-level box. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong was escorted onto the field by Jimmy Wynn and Bob  
Aspromonte, members of the 1965 Astros. About 70 current astronauts 
lined both baselines while Armstrong waved twice to a standing 
ovation and delivered a one-hop pitch to Craig Biggio.

	Armstrong will mark the 30th anniversary of his landmark moon  
walk July 20.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Lays Off 280 in St. Louis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Boeing Co. is laying off 280 workers on its  
fighter aircraft line and says as many as 620 more employees could 
lose their jobs by fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The layoffs stem largely from a slowdown in orders for its F-15  
Eagles, Boeing said. 
</P>
<P>
	The union workers who received pink slips include sheet-metal  
workers, material handlers, and machinists. They will work until 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing said Tuesday that as many as 320 more production workers  
and 300 non-union employees could lose their jobs within six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	The projections, which the company called a ``worst-case  
scenario,'' could mean that Boeing will have trimmed its St. Louis 
work force by 15 percent -- from 22,800 employees to 19,600 -- in 
less than two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle-based Boeing is the world's largest commercial aircraft  
maker and the nation's second-largest defense contractor. St. Louis 
is the headquarters for Boeing's defense division. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has about 36 remaining orders for the F-15 Eagles  
from the Air Force and Saudi Arabia. But the last Eagle will be 
delivered early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing had hoped to receive orders for as many as 40 Eagles from  
Greece as early as last December. The Greek government has 
postponed its decision several times. Boeing also expects to learn 
in May or June whether Israel will buy more of the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing hopes to avoid shutting down the Eagle production line  
because restarting it would be costly. The company is slowing 
production to two Eagles a month from three a month earlier this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Work also is slowing on Boeing's biggest production line in St.  
Louis, the F/A-18 Hornet strike fighter.

<HEADLINE> 4 Cops Arrested in Conn. Crackdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Two Hartford police officers were charged  
Wednesday with demanding sexual favors from prostitutes under 
threat of arrest, and another officer and a former colleague 
pleaded guilty to related charges. 
</P>
<P>
	More arrests are expected from the six-month investigation by  
federal, state and local authorities, said Chief State's Attorney 
John M. Bailey. More than 20 police officers have been ordered to 
appear before a grand jury, The Hartford Courant has reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``These officers betrayed their trust, but more importantly they  
betrayed the other officers in the department,'' said Michael Wolf, 
acting special agent in charge of the FBI's Connecticut office. 
</P>
<P>
	Since October, a federal grand jury has been investigating  
alleged corruption in the department, including the prostitutes' 
allegations and the possibility that officers were involved in two 
unrelated, unsolved slayings. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Courant, prostitutes have told grand jurors  
that officers assigned to two Hartford neighborhoods have ordered 
women into their patrol cars under the threat of arrest, driven 
them to cemeteries and other secluded spots, and demanded oral sex. 
The women said the conduct has gone on for at least two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrol officers Michael Basile, 41, and Jesus Rivera, 30, were  
charged with violating the civil rights of Hartford-area 
prostitutes. Both pleaded innocent and were released on $100,000 
bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Officer Salvatore Abateillo III, 35, pleaded guilty to aiding  
and abetting Rivera. He said he was present during alleged sexual 
acts but did not intervene. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Officer Jose L. Pizarro, also 35, pleaded guilty to  
providing Rivera with a camera used to take nude pictures of the 
prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the alleged crimes happened while the officers were in  
uniform and on duty, prosecutors said. Abateillo, Basile and Rivera 
were suspended without pay, police Chief Joseph F. Croughwell Jr. 
said.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From Recent Editorials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers in the  
United States and abroad: 

</P>
<P>
	April 4  
</P>
<P>
	The Sunday Oregonian, Portland, on Kosovo:  
</P>
<P>
	The air attacks speak to Slobodan Milosevic in a language that  
he can understand. He is unlikely to care about military, or even 
civilian, casualties from the NATO bombs. But he does care about 
his own hold on power. 
</P>
<P>
	That hold is partly the result of his pervasive military and  
security apparatus -- which is the target of these attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslav dictator cannot easily replace the guns, missiles,  
tanks and troops that he is losing every day to NATO attackers. 
When Western military planners say they want Milosevic's oppression 
of the Kosovars to be costly, they mean exactly that. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, it may not even be Milosevic who decides that the  
price for oppressing Kosovars is too high. It may be his military 
or other beneficiaries of the last totalitarian regime in central 
Europe who decide. 
</P>
<P>
	For now though, Milosevic appears to be betting that his  
resources will hold out longer than the West's political resolve. 
If civilized, democratic ideals are to prevail in this troubled 
part of Europe, it's critical that Milosevic's bet turn out to be a 
bad one. 

</P>
<P>
	April 4  
</P>
<P>
	Las Cruces (N.M.) Sun-News, on Kosovo:  
</P>
<P>
	Americans, in the comfort of their living rooms, hear the  
warnings from the TV newscasters: ``The pictures you are about to 
see are unpleasant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then they show video just brought out of Kosovo by an ethnic  
Albanian man of the bodies of up to 100 men in his village who had 
been executed by invading Serbs. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Americans can turn off the TV, and go onto other things --  
pleasant things. They know that some of their fellow Americans are 
carrying the bulk of the load in NATO's mission to stop the mass 
killings of Kosovars and are bombing Yugoslavia and are striving 
against tough odds to get food and water and medical aid and 
shelter to the refugees. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The day will come ... where those who survive will be in tents  
and under the care of humanitarian organizations. Whether and when 
they will ever return to their homes in not known. 
</P>
<P>
	... It can only be hoped that the refugees can someday sit  
peacefully back at home and watch TV themselves to see Milosevic 
and other thugs being tried and convicted by an international war 
crimes tribunal. 

</P>
<P>
	April 1  
</P>
<P>
	The Times-Picayune, New Orleans, on Kosovo:  
</P>
<P>
	The mess that Operation Allied Force in Yugoslavia has become is  
an embarrassment to NATO and the United States and a disaster to 
the Kosovars the operation was designed to protect. 
</P>
<P>
	The first purpose of the massive airstrikes against the Serbian  
military infrastructure was to keep the Serbs from further attacks 
on the Kosovars, yet the Serb attacks were speeded up and increased 
in savagery. ... 
</P>
<P>
	NATO admits that the obviously well planned Serbian campaign  
took them by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	After more than a week of NATO bombing, the Yugoslav President  
Slobodan Milosevic's barbaric scorched-earth ethnic cleansing 
against Kosovo and Kosovars continues unabated. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The other goal of Allied Force has been to compel him to sign  
the agreement on a transitional peace settlement that the Kosovars 
have already signed. ... 
</P>
<P>
	But that idea now seems gone by the board. ...  
</P>
<P>
	Without a discernible NATO exit strategy, the ball remains in  
Mr. Milosevic's court. He must decide whether virtual destruction 
of his military power is worth refusing to deal with the Kosovars. 

</P>
<P>
	April 4  
</P>
<P>
	The Cincinnati Enquirer, on Kosovo:  
</P>
<P>
	If the U.S. and NATO airstrikes stop the Serbs' brutal campaign  
to eradicate Albanian Muslims from the Kosovo province of 
Yugoslavia, a noble chapter in world history can be written, 
telling how the world's greatest superpower used its might not for 
self-interest, but to protect innocent people from savagery in a 
faraway land. 
</P>
<P>
	But history mocks attempts to achieve ground-level goals with  
air attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the best thing Americans can do now is to pray -- and  
help the tidal waves of refugees flooding into Montenegro, 
Macedonia and Albania, poor neighbors that could be dragged into 
war by the burden of hundreds of thousands of desperate, starving 
families. 
</P>
<P>
	Humanitarian aid may stop the spread of war and stabilize the  
region. 

</P>
<P>
	April 2  
</P>
<P>
	Odessa (Texas) American, on Kosovo:  
</P>
<P>
	As NATO steps up its air raids on Serb targets and as U.S. and  
NATO officials hint at the possible commitment of American ground 
troops to the region, Congress is out on spring break until next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	While Kosovo burns, members of Congress are tackling constituent  
business, working on various issues in Washington or traveling the 
globe in pursuit of some policy objective or another. 
</P>
<P>
	It's yet another example of how Congress has abdicated its  
constitutional war-making authority to the executive branch. 
</P>
<P>
	There's nothing wrong with getting back to their districts. But  
both parties' congressional leaders, whether they support the war 
or not, should have kept the House and Senate in session to hold 
hearings about the many facets of this escalating military mission. 
...
</P>
<P>
	One advantage of the congressional recess is that legislators  
might get an earful about the air strikes from their constituents. 
Perhaps that might entice them to take a more active role in this 
very dangerous military action. 

</P>
<P>
	April 5  
</P>
<P>
	Star Tribune of Minneapolis, on Iraq:  
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the sudden cataclysm suffered by Kosovars, the ordeal of  
Iraqis is prolonged. Nearly nine years of international sanctions 
have driven an oil-rich country from a prospering society to one in 
which most people -- though not the governing elite -- lack adequate 
food and medicine. Once again the United Nations is trying to help. 
Once again Iraq says no. 
</P>
<P>
	The impasse seems unbreakable, but experience suggests it is  
not. In the early 1990s, the U.N. Security Council, with strong 
U.S. endorsement, agreed to permit limited Iraqi oil sales to 
purchase food and medicine under U.N. supervision. The offer 
remained on the table for more than a year before Iraq reluctantly 
accepted. The original ceiling, $1.6 billion a year, has risen to 
$5.2 billion every six months. 
</P>
<P>
	So international persistence in dealing with Iraq's unpleasant  
leaders is one route to helping its people survive. But persistence 
has proved difficult lately. Differences within the Security 
Council became acute last fall when Iraq ended all cooperation with 
the U.N. Special Commission charged with overseeing the elimination 
of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Differences became still 
more acute in December after the four-day bombing campaign by 
Britain and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to bridge those differences, the Security Council  
appointed panels to evaluate Iraq's humanitarian conditions, 
disarmament and reparations due Kuwait for its 1990 invasion. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Although the panels' findings respond to criticism of U.N. and  
U.S. policy toward Iraq, they also show a welcome tough-mindedness. 
There is no suggestion of abandoning supervision of Iraqi arms. ... 
Nor is there any suggestion that the panels accept Iraq's 
demonstrably false claim that it is complying with Security Council 
resolutions. That is why the embargo must remain, as the panels 
acknowledge. ... 

</P>
<P>
	April 1.  
</P>
<P>
	The State, Columbia, S.C., on the Kevorkian verdict:  
</P>
<P>
	A jury has rightly decided that Dr. Jack Kevorkian, the death  
angel of the medical world, stepped over a bright, sparkling line 
when he injected a terminally ill patient with a poison that killed 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Until this case, what Kevorkian did was assist some 130 dying  
patients to commit suicide. In other words, he provided the drugs 
and environment for desperately sick people to end their lives. 
They took the final action. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kevorkian clearly committed an act of murder when he gave a  
lethal dose to Thomas Youk, 52, who suffered from Lou Gehrig's 
Disease. ... 
</P>
<P>
	It is clearly beyond the pale for a physician, acting without  
safeguards and with premeditation, to kill in the name of mercy. In 
this case, Kevorkian was an executioner -- not a doctor. 

</P>
<P>
	April 1  
</P>
<P>
	South County Journal, Kent, Wash., on Social Security:  
</P>
<P>
	The economic news is cheery and so the Clinton administration  
trumpets the prediction that the Social Security trust will not 
poop out until 2034. That's two years later than earlier predicted. 
But there's still need to worry. 
</P>
<P>
	The supposed trust fund is an accounting fiction. Lean on it and  
you lean on air. It is essentially a collection of IOUs. It has no 
assets. All the payroll tax surpluses that are owed back to Social 
Security -- which could have gone to pay down debt, making it easier 
to borrow the money when needed -- have actually been spent on other 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Read the fine print and understand the vocabulary in the  
administration's report and you find the real year of reckoning is 
2014. ... 
</P>
<P>
	This predicted year when Social Security income is no longer  
greater than Social Security expenditures is now put at a year 
later than previously, owing to the country's economic growth. But 
2014 is still so close to this problem -- and the amounts then due 
so great -- that action ought to be taken no later than this 
congressional session to begin accumulating real reserves in 
private, profit-producing accounts and thereby preventing 
unpleasant emergency measures later. ... 

</P>
<P>
	March 31  
</P>
<P>
	The News-Journal, Daytona Beach, Fla., on baseball and Cuba:  
</P>
<P>
	If Ping-Pong diplomacy worked modestly to help restore normal  
relations between the United States and Communist China a quarter 
century ago, is it not conceivable that baseball diplomacy could 
play a similar role in improving U.S. relations with Communist 
Cuba? That would be a happy ending, but let's not get carried away 
by one game in Havana. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball is a common language. Its moves, strategy and tactics  
are fully understood by speakers of many tongues. Ideology 
blessedly is foreign to the game. ... 
</P>
<P>
	It is true the 50,000 fans in the stands when the Baltimore  
Orioles played the Cuban national team in Havana the other day were 
all invited by the government, some because they were Communist 
Party members and others as a reward for accomplishments. ... 
</P>
<P>
	But whether the action was before Fidel Castro at Estadio  
Latinoamericano or ordinary Cubans at a dusty old beisbol diamond 
elsewhere in tattered Havana, a good time was had by all. More good 
times could be in store for the Cuban and American people if their 
leaders ever conclude that better political relations serve their 
mutual interests. 

</P>
<P>
	April 7  
</P>
<P>
	Corriere della Sera, Milan, Italy on Kosovo:  
</P>
<P>
	(Yugoslav President Slobodan) Milosevic is clever but follows a  
simple and predictable plan: He used the first phase of NATO air 
strikes to start the ethnic cleansing of a large part of the Kosovo 
population. He announced a unilateral cease-fire, once he completed 
much of this scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	His political and diplomatic aims are evident. NATO has refused  
his peace offer but Milosevic knows some European allies will ask 
for a halt in the air strikes. It's easy to predict that the his 
next move will be to widen this crack. ... 

</P>
<P>
	April 7  
</P>
<P>
	The Daily Telegraph, London, on Kosovo:  
</P>
<P>
	First came the offer to withdraw some Serbian forces from Kosovo  
if NATO stopped bombing Yugoslavia. Yesterday, a more subtle and 
confusing set of proposals emerged. ... Slobodan Milosevic, having 
achieved a furious momentum in his drive to rid Kosovo of 
non-Serbs, is now seeking to halt the momentum building on the 
allied side in an attempt to counter his brutality. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO immediately rejected Belgrade's first offer, made last  
month through Yevgeny Primakov, the Russian prime minister. 
Yesterday, the main alliance powers were commendably swift in 
turning down the second. When the bombing started, we were highly 
skeptical of the alliance's willingness to pursue military action 
to its logical conclusion: the definitive removal of Serbian 
security forces from the province. The past two weeks have seen a 
slight advance in the allies' ambitions, from providing relief from 
persecution to creating conditions for all the refugees to return. 
But their reluctance to define a proper political goal, the 
establishment of an independent Kosovo, leaves them vulnerable to 
Mr. Milosevic's blandishments. ... 

</P>
<P>
	April 6  
</P>
<P>
	The Times, London, on Kosovo:  
</P>
<P>
	As the numbers grow, so do fears and resentment in the  
precarious countries to which the Kosovans are fleeing. All three 
are among the most vulnerable in Europe, desperately poor, beset by 
their own ethnic and tribal conflicts and with shaky governments 
easily overthrown by populists exploiting the present crisis. ... 
</P>
<P>
	NATO insists that as the weather clears ... the Serb terror in  
Kosovo will be slowed and eventually halted. For many, it will be 
too late. Tony Blair was right to insist that the attacks must be 
stepped up. British Tornados based in Germany took part in the air 
raids for the first time at the weekend; two battalions of American 
Apache helicopters, designed to attack ground forces, will soon 
arrive in Tirana. The NATO aim remains consistent: to force the 
Serb troops out of Kosovo, allow the refugees to return and police 
their safety with a Nato peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
	That aim, however, is still far from being achieved. It will  
take a lot more firepower, more flexible tactics and more time to 
break Serbian intransigence. And neither the refugees nor the host 
countries have time. Even after a ceasefire, few will return unless 
a sizeable military force clears the way and escorts them home. ... 

</P>
<P>
	April 6  
</P>
<P>
	Frankfurter Rundschau, Frankfurt, Germany, on NATO:  
</P>
<P>
	NATO didn't imagine its 50th birthday this way. The alliance  
that for decades earnestly maintained peace, finds itself not only 
in a war with Serbia, it is threatened with losing. ... The primary 
war goal of NATO -- to stop the murder and expulsion in Kosovo -- has 
not been achieved. In a few days Milosevic's troops and gangs will 
have completed their ethnic cleansing of Kosovo. Hundreds of 
thousands of Albanians are fleeing and the gigantic task to aid 
them has become the central point of the war, far more so than the 
air attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	A success for celebrator NATO can now only be measured on how  
quickly and in what dimension they succeed in giving back the 
Kosovars their homeland. ... 

</P>
<P>
	April 7  
</P>
<P>
	The Australian, Sydney, on Libya and Lockerbie:  
</P>
<P>
	The imprint of a charred aircraft skeleton over the houses and  
fields of the Scottish village of Lockerbie is an image not easily 
forgotten by those who saw it on their television screens more than 
10 years ago. ... 
</P>
<P>
	This week two men accused of the crime ... have arrived in The  
Netherlands from Libya to face extradition proceedings and then 
trial before a Scottish court built especially in The Netherlands. 
...
</P>
<P>
	Sanctions against Libya could have been eased long ago if the  
Lockerbie accused, indicted in 1991, had surrendered. Indeed, 
sanctions would never have been imposed if the Libyan government 
had not condoned and supported acts of terrorism against other 
states, a history that extends back well before the Lockerbie 
bombing. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The many costs of pursuing the criminals for 10 years ... are  
too high to be quantified but they have had to be paid. If this 
trial demonstrates that acts of terrorism will be punished, no 
matter how long it takes, the effort will have been worthwhile.

<P>
	Neue Zuercher Zeitung, Zurich, Switzerland, on Libya and  
Lockerbie: 
</P>
<P>
	... What exactly persuaded Tripoli to give way is not clear. The  
readiness of the British and Americans to have the proceedings 
against the two alleged terrorists not in Scotland itself but in a 
Scottish court in the Netherlands was not enough to account for the 
Libyan change of heart. 
</P>
<P>
	There may be another, unwritten concession behind the handover:  
a promise from the British and Americans not to stretch the trial 
in the Netherlands into a general reckoning of the Libyan secret 
service and the Gadhafi regime. The clients of the two Libyans... 
will remain hidden. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a renunciation would be detrimental to the court's finding  
of the truth. And the call for justice from the relatives of the 
crash victims would only be fulfilled in part. No one could talk of 
anything more than a merely symbolic conclusion to the unfortunate 
Lockerbie affair.

</P>
<P>
	This week, events in Angola may confirm that neither side in the  
long and bloody civil war can really hope to win. Through the 
weekend, the Unita rebels pushed closer to the strategically 
important northern city of Malanje, capturing most of its outlying 
villages and meeting no resistance from the army. The government, 
last Friday, issued a surprisingly blunt statement, acknowledging 
that Unita was on a roll but promising that it will soon peak and 
the government will then re-assert itself. Western diplomats in the 
capital, Luanda, are not so sure. ...

Israeli communal farm, Oded Gal unloaded baby formula for Kosovo 
refugees onto a U.N. truck, waving a friendly hello at a Saudi 
relief team a few yards down the tarmac. 
</P>
<P>
	The scope of the refugees' suffering has brought together former  
enemies trying to lend a hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``You see this on TV, and you've got to do something,'' said  
Gal, a volunteer with Giving, a privately run Israeli relief group. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to the Kosovo refugee crisis, the Jewish Agency,  
once dedicated solely to Jewish rescue and immigration, has 
launched its first-ever relief operation in a region where 
significant numbers of Jews are not present. 
</P>
<P>
	In Jerusalem, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that  
Israel would take in 100 Kosovar refugees, saying the Jewish state 
felt driven to take the step by its memories of the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
	Jewish Agency chairman Sallai Meridor also recalled the  
Holocaust to explain the shift in his organization's policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have witnessed the horror of people forced out of their

Minister Milo Paskal on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thanks for the human solidarity,'' Paskal replied. ``Albania  
is in difficult days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials say nearly a quarter-million Kosovo refugees now are  
in Albania, driven from their homes in the southern Serbian 
province. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jewish Agency brought in eight tons of relief supplies  
Tuesday, including tents, sleeping bags, baby formula and milk. 
Meridor said another 34 tons would arrive by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	An Israeli army officer briefing soldiers headed for Macedonia  
to set up a field hospital reminded them of the significance of 
returning to lands their parents and grandparents had fled.

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Less Legal Service Cases Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federally funded agency that provides free  
legal aid for poor Americans overstated the number of cases it 
handled in 1997 by tens of thousands, drawing the ire of lawmakers 
who rely on the figures to decide how much money to give the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal Services Corp., a target of Republican budget cuts, says  
it has cleared up local bookkeeping errors and as a result expects 
to report 200,000 fewer cases to Congress for 1998 -- a 10 percent 
drop from the previous year's inflated figure. 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas, a longtime critic,  
called the overcounting ``the grossest example of Washington 
bureaucrats abusing hard-earned taxpayer money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Legal Services President John McKay acknowledges the 1997 count  
was ``slightly off,'' and will be adjusted in hindsight. But he 
says the agency wasn't intentionally misleading. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not significant in terms of overall cases and services we  
are providing,'' said McKay, a Republican elected by the bipartisan 
board two years ago. ``If anything, we're underreporting the 
services we provide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agency didn't have enough information to alert Congress that  
there was a problem until just two months ago, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal Services reported serving 1.93 million clients in 1997.  
But a review of just five of the agency's 269 regional programs 
found officials had overstated their caseload by at least 90,000. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of improved counting methods, the agency expects to  
report 1.73 million cases for 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports by Legal Services' inspector general, the agency's  
internal watchdog, and other documents obtained by The Associated 
Press provide a more detailed picture of the overcounting. 
</P>
<P>
	Documents showed problems in at least five regional programs.  
They included telephone calls from people who did not get legal 
help or were ineligible for assistance that were reported as new 
cases, cases that were double-counted and counting of outdated 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
	A group in Lakeland, Fla., serving rural areas reported 44,993  
new cases -- eight times the 5,500 valid cases it actually worked, 
officials said. Peter Helwig, executive director, blamed a computer 
error for most of the problems. 
</P>
<P>
	About 70 percent of nearly 73,000 closed cases recorded by  
regional programs in San Francisco, San Diego, Miami, and northern 
Virginia, were not valid, officials found. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the Legal Aid Society of San Diego misreported more  
than 14,000 telephone calls as cases, an audit found. San Diego 
executive director Gregory Knoll said, however, that ``every caller 
has their problem assessed'' even if they don't receive legal 
advice. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal Services, a nonprofit corporation, provides federal grants  
to local agencies that provide legal assistance to low-income 
Americans who need help with civil cases such as tenant problems or 
court protection from domestic violence. Congressional Republicans 
slashed the program's money by 30 percent in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal Services handed out $283 million taxpayer money to local  
programs last year, and its funding was increased to $300 million 
in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The extent of overcounting at Legal Services' outlets nationwide  
is unclear. The agency is in the process of checking a handful of 
the other 269 programs that received funding in 1997, and so far 
overcounting elsewhere is less severe, Legal Services inspector 
general Edouard Quatrevaux said. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal Services officials say they are fixing the problems, which  
they blamed on out-of-date policies for counting cases and sloppy 
bookkeeping. 
</P>
<P>
	And McKay noted that Legal Services helps many more people than  
are recorded as actual cases. The agency doesn't collect statistics 
on people who receive assistance other than legal advice over the 
phone such as referrals and educational seminars or as a result of 
a family member getting legal help. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're helping a battered woman, you are probably helping  
her one to three children and bringing justice to their lives,'' 
McKay said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials say the agency inspector general first learned as  
early as February 1998 that some regional offices had overcounted. 
Some Congress members want to know why they weren't informed until 
a year later, which was months after lawmakers had already approved 
the agency's 1999 budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Tom Latham, R-Iowa, a member of the House Appropriations  
subcommittee that oversees Legal Services, questioned whether the 
inspector general adhered ``to even the spirit'' of his duties. 
</P>
<P>
	Quatrevaux, the inspector general, said he didn't have enough  
information to report the problems until February, when he briefed 
the subcommittee staff, and to have done so before would have 
``premature.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Awards $26.5 Mil. to Smoker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Jurors were right to blame Philip Morris  
for concealing tobacco's dangers, marketing cigarettes to minors 
and ruining the health of a three-pack-a-day smoker who now has 
lung cancer, a judge says. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he cut her $51.5 million damage award nearly in half.  
</P>
<P>
	The new award -- $26.5 million -- is still enough to cause  
``substantial discomfort'' even to a company the size of Philip 
Morris, Judge John Munter ruled Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The original verdict won by Patricia Henley in February was then  
the largest ever in a tobacco liability lawsuit filed by an 
individual smoker. The jury awarded $1.5 million in compensatory 
damages to cover medical expenses and $50 million in punitive 
damages to punish the cigarette maker, which has a net worth of 
$3.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Awards in three similar cases have been overturned on appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	Although Munter said the $50 million punitive award was  
excessive, the reduced amount is still more than the $15 million 
Ms. Henley sought at trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge also denied the company's request for a new trial,  
saying the evidence showed Philip Morris ``failed to disclose 
information known to it concerning the addictive and harmful 
properties of its product.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company also ``misled the American public'' by claiming a  
continuing scientific controversy on the effects of smoking, and 
``willfully and consciously marketed its cigarettes to 
teen-agers,'' Munter wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Harry Wartnick, a lawyer for Ms. Henley, noted that she has the  
option of rejecting the reduced award and retrying the case. But he 
said $26.5 million should be enough to ``get a message across to 
Philip Morris and to any other company that looks to market 
products that kill human beings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris attorney Michael York said the company planned to  
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a number of very significant and complicated legal  
issues that need to be resolved by an appellate court,'' York said. 
He declined to specify the issues or comment on the judge's 
criticism of Philip Morris. 
</P>
<P>
	William Ohlemeyer, another lawyer for the company, had argued  
that Philip Morris wasn't responsible for Ms. Henley's decision to 
smoke and never claimed cigarettes were safe. He said there was no 
evidence she started smoking or continued to smoke because of 
Philip Morris ads. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Henley, 52, of Los Angeles, said she became hooked on  
Marlboros at age 15 and smoked three packs a day until 1997, after 
she started suffering coughing fits and other health problems. She 
was diagnosed last year with inoperable lung cancer, which she says 
is now in remission after chemotherapy and radiation. 
</P>
<P>
	Her suit was the first tried in California since the repeal of a  
1987 law that protected tobacco companies against suits by 
individual smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, an Oregon jury awarded $80.3 million to the family of  
a Portland man who died of lung cancer after smoking three packs of 
Marlboros a day for 42 years.

<HEADLINE> Rockets' Price Has Knee Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Houston Rockets backup guard Brent Price  
underwent knee surgery Wednesday, a day after being injured in a 
victory over Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
	Price, hampered by a variety of injuries during a five-year  
career, is expected to be out 3-4 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Team physicians Walter Lowe and Bruce Moseley performed the  
arthroscopic procedure to repair a cartilage tear of the lateral 
meniscus in Price's right knee. Doctors said the operation was 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
	Price twisted his knee while landing awkwardly after throwing a  
pass to Scottie Pippen on the final play of the first half Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Price, coming off the bench this season, has been averaging  
eight points and three assists. 
</P>
<P>
	He missed the 1994-95 season with a knee injury and played only  
25 games in 1996-97 because of an elbow injury and another knee 
problem.

<HEADLINE> HP Names Executives of Four Units </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- Hewlett-Packard Co. has named top  
executives for its four key business operations but is still 
looking for a new chief executive for the computing and imaging 
company it is spinning off next year. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Palo Alto, Calif., corporation announced that  
Carolyn Ticknor, 51, will be the Boise-based president and chief 
executive of the laserjet imaging systems unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Ann Livermore, 40, was named president and chief executive  
officer of the enterprise computing solutions unit, which includes 
computer systems, storage and software. 
</P>
<P>
	Duane Zitzner, 51, is the president and chief executive of the  
company's computer products unit, which includes the company's 
business and home personal computers, servers, workstations, 
storage devices and mobile appliances. 
</P>
<P>
	And Antonio Perez, 53, was named president and chief executive  
of the inkjet imaging solutions unit. 
</P>
<P>
	The four were former general managers and vice presidents of  
their units and will remain corporate vice presidents. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Hewlett-Packard said it will make its $7.6  
billion-a-year test and measurement equipment operations into a 
separate company in 2000 in order to focus on its core computer and 
printer business. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining computing and imaging company, which will operate

<HEADLINE> Penguins' Jagr Out With Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The NHL's top scorer will sit out a game with  
a slight groin injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh Penguins star Jaromir Jagr, who leads the NHL with 82  
assists and 122 points in 77 games, didn't travel to Philadelphia 
on Wednesday for Thursday's matchup with the Flyers, team spokesman 
Tom McMillan said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Jagr's injury is minor, but Jagr opted to rest rather  
than risk more serious injury with the playoffs only five regular 
season games away. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nothing major, nothing catastrophic,'' McMillan said.  
``You just don't push it this time of year'' in anticipation of 
keeping players healthy for the playoffs. McMillan said officials 
will monitor Jagr day to day, and Jagr should be able to play at 
Detroit on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins have lost their last seven games (0-5-2), and have  
won just one of their last 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers are 1-3-1 in their last five games and will be  
missing star center Eric Lindros at least until the playoffs, which 
start April 21.

<HEADLINE>  Yugoslavia seals off Kosovo borders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslav authorities sealed off  
Kosovo's main border crossings Wednesday, preventing ethnic 
Albanians from leaving as the wave of refugees approached the 
half-million mark. As NATO stepped up its airstrikes, a Cypriot 
mediator sought freedom for three captured U.S. soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO planes and cruise missile struck military targets in Kosovo  
and inflicted heavy damage elsewhere in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Albania's parliament approved NATO plans to send in 24 U.S.  
Apache attack helicopters -- a move that should bolster the 
alliance's firepower against the Yugoslav tanks and armor that have 
driven ethnic Albanians from their homes in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	After forcing more than 400,000 refugees out to neighboring  
countries, Yugoslav authorities closed the main exit route on 
Wednesday without explanation, forcing tens of thousands of people 
back toward the burned villages they had been escaping from. 
</P>
<P>
	German Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping warned that the  
Yugoslavs may be planning to use the civilians in Kosovo as ``human 
shields'' against NATO attack. 
</P>
<P>
	In Morini, the crossing point for Kosovo refugees into Albania,  
the flow of cars and tractors suddenly stopped at 3 a.m., witnesses 
said. Yugoslav border guards could be seen laying what appeared to 
be mines and digging fortifications just inside their territory. 
</P>

	The former president of Cyprus, Spyros Kyprianou, began a

<P>
	Kyprianou flew to Athens, where he said he was ``waiting for the

Kosovo refugees who had made it across into neighboring Macedonia 
only to be trapped for days in squalid conditions.

border city of Blace on Wednesday, hustling thousands of refugees 
onto buses so quickly that some were separated from their families.

	Macedonia, which has been criticized for conditions at the  
makeshift camp, said it shipped 10,000 refugees to Albania and 
moved 25,000 others to NATO tent camps further in-country.

unaccounted for.

They don't even know where their relatives are, where their mothers 
are,'' said Nebi Qena, 21, after being moved from Blace to a 
NATO-run camp. ``My brother was on the other side of the border 
waiting to get in. I don't know if he was turned back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Macedonia has been flooded with more than 130,000 refugees since  
NATO airstrikes began March 24, and it has castigated the United

in the campaign.

	NATO is trying to force Milosevic to withdraw Serb special  
police and military units from Kosovo and accept a three-year 
interim autonomy agreement that would be policed by 28,000 NATO 
troops, including American soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic Albanians made up 90 percent of the 2 million prewar  
populace of Kosovo, a province in Serbia, the main republic in 
Yugoslavia. Milosevic's crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists

<P>

that NATO was ``deeply preoccupied'' by reports of atrocities being 
committed against civilians and that in Kosovo 50 villages 
reportedly have been burned since Saturday.

<P>
	He also said three mass gravesites been identified, based on  
refugee testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army claimed Serb  
forces massacred at least 51 civilians, including 12 children, 
during a raid on the village of Celina, southwest of Pristina, 
hours after the airstrikes began. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said  
nine Serb commanders have been linked to atrocities in Kosovo and 
could face war crime prosecutions.

<HEADLINE>  Yugoslavia seals off Kosovo borders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslav authorities sealed off  
Kosovo's main border crossings Wednesday, preventing ethnic 
Albanians from leaving as the wave of refugees approached the 
half-million mark. As NATO stepped up its airstrikes, a Cypriot 
mediator sought freedom for three captured U.S. soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO planes and cruise missile struck military targets in Kosovo  
and inflicted heavy damage elsewhere in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Albania's parliament approved NATO plans to send in 24 U.S.  
Apache attack helicopters -- a move that should bolster the 
alliance's firepower against the Yugoslav tanks and armor that have 
driven ethnic Albanians from their homes in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	After forcing more than 400,000 refugees out to neighboring  
countries, Yugoslav authorities closed the main exit route on 
Wednesday without explanation, forcing tens of thousands of people 
back toward the burned villages they had been escaping from. 
</P>
<P>
	German Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping warned that the  
Yugoslavs may be planning to use the civilians in Kosovo as ``human 
shields'' against NATO attack. 
</P>
<P>
	In Morini, the crossing point for Kosovo refugees into Albania,  
the flow of cars and tractors suddenly stopped at 3 a.m., witnesses 
said. Yugoslav border guards could be seen laying what appeared to 
be mines and digging fortifications just inside their territory. 
</P>
<P>
	``The refugees ... were told to return to their places of  
residence -- whatever is left of those places,'' said Doran Vienneau

<HEADLINE> Study Cites 4th Grade Beer Drinking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Some of the nation's fourth-grade students  
have already started drinking beer and wine coolers or sniffing 
inhalants on a monthly basis, a national organization that monitors 
drug use among youths reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	In a self-reported survey of 26,086 fourth-, fifth- and  
sixth-grade students nationwide, fourth graders said they had used 
cigarettes (4.1 percent), beer (7.7 percent) and inhalants (6.3 
percent) at some time. 
</P>
<P>
	Of those fourth graders, 2.1 percent said they drink beer, 2.2  
percent drink wine coolers and 2.2 percent use inhalants on a 
monthly basis. 
</P>
<P>
	The initial use of cigarettes increased to 7 percent in the  
fifth grade, and 14.8 percent in the sixth grade, while use of beer 
rose to 8.2 percent in the fifth grade and to 15 percent in the 
sixth grade, according to the survey by the Atlanta-based 
organization, Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey was released today as the organization began a  
conference in Cincinnati. It was the organization's first 
nationwide look at drug and alcohol use by youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
	Peer use was a factor influencing some youngsters to try drugs,  
alcohol and cigarettes, organization officials said. But parents 
can be influential in persuading youngsters to avoid using those 
things simply by talking to their children before they experiment, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was conducted during the 1997-98 school year. The  
organization sent a questionnaire to participating schools with 
instructions for administering the anonymous questionnaire.

<HEADLINE> GM's US Sales Down; Others Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp.'s sales fell 2 percent last  
month in the United States in contrast with strong gains by its 
major competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's largest automaker blamed a shortage of its  
hottest-selling product, the Chevrolet Silverado full-size pickup. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's sales report today closed the books on March, which saw a  
surprisingly strong 8 percent increase in industry sales of cars 
and light trucks despite GM's retreat. For the first quarter, 
overall sales were up 11 percent from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Car sales at GM were up 1 percent last month, offset by a 6  
percent decline in light trucks, compared with March 1998, when its 
truck inventories and sales incentives were high. GM said it 
continues to have problems getting enough of its redesigned '99 
Silverados to dealers, in part because of a shortage of double-deck 
rail cars in Canada. One of the three Silverado plants is in 
Oshawa, Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a record-breaking March, meanwhile, for Ford Motor Co. as  
the No. 2 automaker's pickups and sport utility vehicles attracted 
thousands more buyers to its dealerships. The company announced 
Tuesday it is increasing production. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading this afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange, GM was  
down $1.06 1/4 at $90 a share, while Ford was up $2.25 at $60.50. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford reported Tuesday that its U.S. sales were up 14 percent  
last month, based on the daily sales rate. Ford broke a long list 
of company records, led by its strongest monthly sales of light 
trucks ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's report came after last week's largely upbeat sales  
figures from DaimlerChrysler AG and most major foreign automakers. 
</P>
<P>
	March sales of F-series pickups, the nation's top-selling  
vehicle for 17 years, were the highest for any car or truck in any 
month since June 1978. Ford sold 85,686 of the full-size pickups 
last month, more than many models achieve over an entire year. The 
June '78 record was 90,370 F-series trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's car sales, excluding its Jaguar unit, were up nearly 6  
percent while its light truck sales increased 19 percent to set a 
record for any month. SUV sales were up 11 percent while total 
pickup sales were up 28 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The news was especially good for Ford because pickups and SUVs  
carry the highest profit margins. Much of the big increase in 
F-series sales was due to robust demand for the new F-250 and F-350 
Super Duty trucks built at Ford's Louisville, Ky., truck plant, 
which has been running full-tilt with three shifts. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're crying all the way to the bank,'' said analyst David  
Healy of Burnham Securities Inc. ``The models that are the most 
profitable for them have the biggest year-over-year increase in 
sales.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford announced Tuesday that it was increasing its second-quarter  
production by 20,000 trucks and 10,000 cars to meet the strong 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
	The Explorer and Expedition SUVs also set March sales records,  
while the new Mercury Cougar and the Escort ZX2 coupes had their 
best sales months yet. Ford's minivan sales were up 23 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Rewey, Ford vice president of marketing and sales, said a  
stable economy marked by high consumer confidence, income growth, 
low inflation and interest rates was behind the robust demand. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both Wall Street and Main Street respond favorably to  
consistency and stability,'' Rewey said. ``We believe that stable 
fiscal and monetary policy have played a key role in the duration 
of this expansion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Healy said he does not see any drop in the high demand in the  
short term. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see anything in the picture that's going to slow this  
down unless gasoline prices keep going up 30 cents a gallon every 
week,'' he said. ``At this point, the gasoline thing is just a 
minor irritant to people who want to buy an Expedition or an 
Excursion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jaguar's sales were down 17 percent last month.

<HEADLINE> Diller Purchases Two Movie Studios </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Media mogul Barry Diller is getting back into  
the movie business by purchasing the studios October Films and 
Gramercy Pictures and part of the PolyGram film business from 
Seagram Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Diller's USA Networks Inc. and Seagram announced the deal  
Wednesday without disclosing the purchase price. Sources who 
insisted on anonymity put it at between $200 million and $300 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase provides Diller -- who once ran Paramount Pictures --  
with a much-needed movie supply for his cable outlets, USA Network 
and Sci-Fi Channel. 
</P>
<P>
	October and Gramercy are major distributors of so-called art  
house films, which offer unconventional themes and are produced on 
relatively small budgets. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal also positions Diller as a major competitor to Miramax,  
the leader of the art house genre. 
</P>
<P>
	The new movie venture, to be called USA Films, will be headed by  
Scott Greenstein, who had been one of the presidents of October 
Films. USA Films will be a division of USA Networks Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the art house labels, Diller also purchased  
PolyGram's domestic movie operations. 
</P>
<P>
	For Montreal-based Seagram, the sale helps reduce the heavy debt  
it took on last year through its $10.4 billion purchase of 
PolyGram's parent company,PolyGram NV. 
</P>
<P>
	Ever since that deal was struck, Seagram had been looking for  
buyers for much of PolyGram's movie assets, while planning to 
retain its large recorded music business. 
</P>
<P>
	Seagram, which also owns Universal Studios, will keep its hands  
in the art house film business. Universal has a deal with Working 
Title Films -- a production house formerly affiliated with Gramercy 
-- to create three to five movies a year with budgets of up to $20 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Working Title has a strong track record that includes the Oscar  
nominees ``Elizabeth'' and ``Fargo'' and the blockbuster ``Four 
Weddings and a Funeral.'' It also produced the upcoming Julia 
Roberts-Hugh Grant romance ``Notting Hill,'' which will be 
distributed by Universal on May 28. 
</P>
<P>
	Seagram will maintain close ties to Diller with a 45 percent  
ownership stake in USA Networks Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	While Diller doesn't get the creative minds at Working Title, he  
has in October Films a company with an impressive history in the 
independent movie business. 
</P>
<P>
	Its 60 releases include ``Hilary and Jackie,'' ``Secrets and  
Lies,'' ``The Apostle'' and the current release ``Cookie's 
Fortune'' from director Robert Altman. Its upcoming films include 
Sundance Film Festival winner ``Three Seasons'' and Albert Brooks' 
``The Muse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diller got back into the movie business in the same manner he  
launched his television operation: by shopping at Seagram. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Seagram chief executive Edgar Bronfman Jr. shocked  
Hollywood by selling most of Universal's television assets to his 
mentor, Diller. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the USA Network and Sci-Fi Channel, Diller's USA  
Networks now includes Home Shopping Network and Ticketmaster, the 
telephone ticket ordering service. 
</P>
<P>
	After Bronfman sold the TV assets, questions swept the  
entertainment industry on whether he would remain committed to the 
movie business. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation heightened as Bronfman bought PolyGram to bolster  
his music business and after Universal produced a string of movie 
flops last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech last month in Canada, Bronfman insisted he was  
committed to films, saying the movie business ``plays an important 
strategic role in enhancing the value of our other entertainment 
assets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seagram shares rose $4.06 1/4 to $59 on the New York Stock  
Exchange. USA Networks Inc. rose 50 cents to $36.56 1/4 on the Nasdaq 
Stock Market.

<HEADLINE> Judge Judy, Hubby May Compete </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Imagine their arguments at the dining room  
table. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Judy Sheindlin may soon face some competition from her  
husband. George Sheindlin, like his wife a retired New York City 
judge, is talking to producers of ``People's Court'' about taking 
over as arbiter, an executive with the syndicated TV show's 
distributors who asked not to be identified said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Left in the cold could be current ``People's Court'' jurist  
Edward Koch, who appointed both Sheindlins to the bench when he was 
New York City mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Judge Judy'' has dominated the newly hot court show genre. Its  
ratings are up 76 percent over last season, and the no-nonsense 
former judge is a star. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the ratings for ``People's Court'' haven't changed  
over the past year and two new TV judges, Joe Brown and Mills Lane, 
have passed Koch in average audience size, said Marc Berman, a 
television analyst for the media buying firm Seltel. 
</P>
<P>
	The audience for ``Judge Judy'' is two and a half times that of  
``People's Court,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Signing up Mr. Judge Judy could entice curious viewers who  
wonder what sort of man would live with her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's a bad thing, because the show needs some  
attention,'' Berman said. ``I don't think he will beat Judy in the 
long run, but it will bring people in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``People's Court'' has discussed having Sheindlin appear in at  
least half of the shows during the TV season that begins in 
September, said the executive from Warner Bros. Television, the 
show's distributors. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Judy sent word through a spokeswoman that she didn't want  
to talk about potentially competing with her husband.

	Warthog Aircraft Attack Serb Forces  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton dismissed Yugoslavia's  
cease-fire in Kosovo as a hollow promise and said today the United 
States and NATO are ``determined to stay united and to persist 
until we prevail.'' After two weeks of NATO airstrikes on Belgrade 
and strategic command centers of Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic, Clinton said, the Western alliance is not about to ease 
up. Milosevic, whom Pentagon officials called ``rattled'' by the 
bombing campaign, declared a unilateral cease-fire of his security 
forces in the Kosovo province yesterday. 

</P>
<P>
	U.S. Warns Serb Commanders  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department warned nine top Serb  
military officers in Kosovo today that they could be charged with 
war crimes and crimes against humanity being committed under their 
commands. U.S. officials believe the commanders are in charge of 
operations that have pushed more than 400,000 ethnic Albanians out 
of Kosovo since NATO bombing of Yugoslavia began two weeks ago. The 
fact that they may have been under orders from Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic would not leave them immune from individual 
prosecution, the State Department said. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Defends China Policies  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton defended his policy toward  
Beijing and said the United States must not slip into a 
``campaign-driven cold war with China'' that isolates the world's 
most populous nation. Setting the stage for talks with Chinese 
Premier Zhu Rongji, the president defended his policy of engagement 
with China despite sharp differences on human rights, trade and 
weapons proliferation. Relations also have been soured by 
suspicions that China stole nuclear warhead secrets from the United 
States.

income tax returns is secret, but the self-employed and people 
claiming unusually high itemized deductions are among those more 
likely to face an audit. The Internal Revenue Service audits less 
than 2 percent of the returns it receives and won't disclose 
precisely how it targets them. From the IRS standpoint, the only 
people who should fear an audit are those who are trying to cheat 
or those who don't have documentation for their deductions or other 
claims.

	Amazon Forest Fading Faster  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Brazil's Amazon rain forest is being destroyed  
or badly damaged more than twice as fast as normally believed, 
according to a study that relied on airplane surveys and 
on-the-ground interviews instead of satellite images. The 
researchers said their method more accurately measured the effects 
of logging and burning in the 1.3 million-square-mile rain forest. 
Selective logging is difficult to detect by satellite, and new 
growth quickly hides fire damage as viewed from above.

	Software Maker Sues Online Critics

<P>
	SANFORD, Fla. (AP) -- A software maker is suing seven  
unidentified people who wrote critical comments about the company 
on an Internet message board. Phoenix International Ltd. claims the 
rumors on the message board operated by Yahoo! Inc. defamed the 
company and caused its stock price to dip. Phoenix has issued 
subpoenas for Yahoo! records, demanding that the company disclose 
the names of the chat-room participants. Phoenix executive Bahram 
Yusefzadeh said some of the messages, many of which are critical of 
himself, appear to be from employees and former employees.

	World Bank: Global Crisis May Go On

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The World Bank predicted today the global  
financial crisis may last longer than expected despite recent signs 
of recovery in Asia and Brazil. The bank, in a report assessing 
worldwide financial conditions, expressed concern about the 
possibility of protectionist trade policies if the U.S. economy 
falters, European markets fail to revive and Japan's recession 
deepens. He said the bank wanted to warn against complacency as 
economies in Asia, where the crisis began 21 months ago, start to 
bounce back.

	ATLANTA (AP) -- Howard Milstein withdrew his $800 million bid to  
buy the Washington Redskins today when it became apparent his group 
lacked support from NFL owners. The league's finance committee 
failed to recommend approval of the sale, voting 3-3 with one 
abstention after a 4 1/2-hour meeting. Milstein, a New York real 
estate developer and part-owner of the NHL's Islanders, then 
addressed all the owners before announcing his withdrawal.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Charging $3 Minimum Fee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- All of AT&AMP;T Corp.'s long-distance customers will  
soon receive a $3 minimum monthly charge, even if they don't make 
any long-distance calls. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T, which has 70 million long-distance customers, introduced a  
minimum monthly charge last August, charging the $3 to plan 
subscribers and new customers. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, AT&AMP;T customers not currently signed up for one of the  
company's calling plans will also be assessed the monthly fee. 
</P>
<P>
	About 10 million AT&AMP;T customers make less than $3 a month in  
calls. AT&AMP;T, the nation's largest telecommunications company, said 
it needs the money to cover the $300 million a year it costs to 
service infrequent callers. 
</P>
<P>
	Minimum charges, until now, had been more limited.  
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom, the second largest long-distance company, also has  
a $3 monthly minimum for customers who don't use its promotional 
calling plans, but doesn't charge the fee to its remaining 
customers, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 3 Sprint, conversely, only charges a minimum fee to those  
who sign up for promotions. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T said it would waive the fee for some low-income customers.  
But consumer groups said charges are hurting those customers least 
able to afford it. 
</P>
<P>
	``AT&AMP;T's new minimum charge is the latest example of  
telecommunications deregulation run amok, driving up prices for 
millions of consumers,'' said Gene Kimmelman, of the 
Washington-based Consumers Union, in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimmelman noted that other fees, ranging from $2-3 a month,  
already were instituted in the wake of telecommunications 
deregulation in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Farrakhan Released From Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan was  
discharged from Howard University Hospital on Wednesday after 
treatment related to his prostate cancer, a hospital spokeswoman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan, 65, was taken to the hospital last week for surgery  
to correct an inflammation caused by cancer treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	University spokeswoman Donna Brock said she could not say where  
he was going. Farrakhan lives in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Farrakhan's doctors held a news conference to say  
Farrakhan, who was first diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1991, 
was free of the disease. Nation of Islam officials said then that 
Farrakhan would continue his three-month sabbatical and would use 
his experience to spread the word that prostate cancer is more 
common and aggressive in black men. 
</P>
<P>
	Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among U.S.  
men and the second-deadliest, behind lung cancer. This year, 
184,500 American men will be diagnosed with the disease and more 
than 39,200 will die from it, the American Cancer Society 
estimates.

</P>
<P>
	MINSK, Belarus (AP) -- Gennady Karpenko, a prominent Belarusian  
opposition leader, died Tuesday of a stroke. He was 49. 
</P>
<P>
	Karpenko was vice speaker of Belarus' popularly elected  
parliament before President Alexander Lukashenko disbanded it in 
1996 and replaced it with a body of his supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The disbanded parliament is still recognized as legitimate by  
many Western democracies, the Organization for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe and the Council of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	After parliament was dissolved, Karpenko worked as one of the  
leaders of the opposition United Civic Party. A physicist by 
training, he was a member of the Belarusian Academy of Sciences.

	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- George D. Lockhart, a founder of the  
Pittsburgh law firm Kirkpatrick &AMP; Lockhart LLP, died Monday of 
congestive heart failure. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart began practicing law at the Pittsburgh firm of Reed  
Smith Shaw &AMP; McClay. In 1946, after completing his military service 
during World War II, he and six other lawyers formed their own 
firm. 
</P>

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Michael Manuel, a director and writer who worked  
with the Metropolitan Opera for a decade, died of lung cancer 
Monday in Fleming, N.J. He was 70. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in London, Manuel briefly attended the Royal Academy of  
music in 1928. Twenty years later he joined the Royal Opera 
company, Covent Garden, as an assistant stage manager. Within three 
years he was stage manager for the Royal Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined the Met in 1957 as executive stage manager, and  
directed Gluck's ``Orfeo and Eurydice'' and ``Alcestis,'' and 
Strauss' ``Elektra.'' In 1964 Manuel was appointed co-general 
manager of the Metropolitan Opera National Company, which played 
240 performances in 72 cities in its first season. 
</P>
<P>
	Manuel, a resident of New Hope, Pa., left the Met after the  
company's dissolution following its second season, and became a 
researcher and scriptwriter for the ``New Media Bible'' and other 
educational television and video productions.

</P>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Lou Milliner, a retired New Orleans newsman  
for The Associated Press whose career spanned from Morse code to 
the computer, died Sunday at age 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Milliner started his career in Little Rock, Ark., in 1935 for  
United Press, before the organization became UPI, and copy was 
transmitted in Morse. As technology progressed, he shifted to 
teletype and finally the computer. 
</P>
<P>
	After World War II, he joined the AP in New York, but  
transferred back to New Orleans in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
	As night editor, he handled copy on Earl Long, the Kefauver  
hearings, James Meredith and integration, hurricanes and a steady 
flow of daily news. Among his bylined assignments was a trip to 
interview Gen. Anastasio Somoza, the strongman president of 
Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
	Milliner was famous for circling errors -- ordinary ones in black  
or blue, the most egregious in red -- and posting them on the office 
bulletin board to expose the guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	He was equally well known for his passion for photography and  
scrapbooks. For 28 of his 30 years with the AP, he took pictures of 
every person he ever worked with and had 400 of them. 
</P>
<P>
	He retired in 1977.  
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, Gladys Welch Milliner; two sons, a  
daughter and seven grandchildren.

                             *Red Norvo    	
</P>
<P>
	SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- Red Norvo, who performed with such  
greats as Charles Mingus and Frank Sinatra and is credited with 
introducing the xylophone to jazz, died Tuesday at age 91. 
</P>
<P>
	Born Kenneth Norville in Beardstown, Ill., he taught himself how  
to play piano and xylophone. By age 17, he was touring with a 
vaudeville show and later joined the Paul Ash Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
	His last name changed to Norvo after Ash mispronounced it to a  
reporter and Norvo's manager decided the shorter name was more 
fitting. 
</P>
<P>
	During Norvo's tenure with Paul Whiteman's Orchestra, which he  
joined in 1932, he met singer Mildred Bailey, whom he later 
married. By 1935, he formed his own sextet that played in clubs on 
New York City's 52nd Street. 
</P>
<P>
	In subsequent years, Norvo and his wife, who were known as ``Mr.  
and Mrs. Swing,'' formed several groups in New York and Chicago. 
Among their hits in the 1930s were ``Rockin' Chair,'' ``Please Be 
Kind,'' ``Says My Heart'' and ``Have You Forgotten So Soon?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1943, he switched from xylophone to vibraphone, which he  
played almost exclusively for the rest of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Norvo continued to perform until he suffered a stroke in the  
early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bailey, whose likeness was featured on a 1996 U.S. postage  
stamp, died in 1951. Norvo later married Eve Rogers, who died in 
1992.

<HEADLINE> Yield Rises in Bond Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Yields on 30-year, inflation-indexed bonds  
rose in Wednesday's auction. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield was 3.899 percent, the highest on record. The bonds  
sold at 3.680 percent at the last auction on July 8 and 3.740 
percent at the first auction on April 15, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the government's 10th auction of inflation-indexed  
securities -- and the third at the 30-year maturity -- since it began 
selling them in January 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the yield, owners of inflation-indexed bonds  
receive an adjustment to principal twice a year. For instance, if 
inflation were 2 percent in a year, the principal of a $1,000 note 
would increase to $1,020. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of $7 billion in bonds were sold out of bids totaling  
$14.7 billion.

<HEADLINE> Witness Blames Talk Show for Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- A psychiatrist testifying Wednesday in a  
$50 million wrongful death lawsuit blamed ``The Jenny Jones Show'' 
for the death of a gay guest who revealed a secret crush on another 
man. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Schmitz confessed to shooting Scott Amedure in 1995  
three days after the taping on the show, which never aired. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Bernard Carroll, who testified for Amedure's family, said he  
thought the show deceived Schmitz, whom he said suffered from 
mental illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jonathan Schmitz would not have killed Scott Amedure but for  
them appearing on this show,'' Carroll said. ``This was a 
psychological assault and battery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amedure's family sued the show and its producer, Warner Bros.,  
claiming they ambushed a mentally ill Schmitz. The show contends it 
was not responsible for Amedure's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Carroll said he had reviewed Schmitz's medical records, and had  
diagnosed him as suffering from depression and bipolar disorder 
with occasional psychotic episodes, and had a history of alcohol 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Schmitz had once thought his girlfriend had died while  
she was on a trip, and had nailed himself inside his apartment, 
built an altar to her and didn't leave for four days. 
</P>
<P>
	Carroll also said the show repeatedly told Schmitz his secret  
admirer could be a woman -- even though the title of the show was 
``Same Sex Secret Crushes'' -- and that Schmitz did not want to 
believe otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	When the admirer was revealed as Amedure, and Amedure describes  
a sexual fantasy about Schmitz, Carroll said the show turned into a 
``sadomasochistic situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's being abused, but at the same time he's tolerates it  
because he's unable to marshal the resources to leave,'' he 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz turned violent three days later only after he couldn't  
suppress his pain any longer, Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense was set to question Carroll on Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Schmitz was convicted of Amedure's murder. The verdict  
was overturned because of an error in jury selection. His retrial 
is scheduled for Aug. 19.

<HEADLINE> Labor Talks Could Stall WNBA Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Women's pro basketball may be about to match the  
men, at least on the labor front, as stalemated negotiations are 
threatening the start of the season, scheduled for June 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The league has set a Saturday deadline for reaching a contract  
agreement with its players. Without one, the Women's National 
Basketball Association could order a lockout, the same way the NBA 
did in July. That labor dispute delayed the start of the NBA season 
until Feb. 5, cost players an estimated $400 million in salaries 
and reduced the schedule from 82 games to 50. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't discuss our options,'' said Val Ackerman, president of  
the WNBA, which is owned by the NBA, said Tuesday. ``We continue to 
remain optimistic that we can make a deal. Time is very short. We 
indicated that in February when we began these talks. We have a 
pre-draft camp scheduled for next weekend and a draft at the end of 
April. It's important to move quickly. Negotiations have been 
ongoing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	WNBA players, who are represented by the NBA Players  
Association, are seeking increases from the league's $15,000 
minimum salary to $45,000, a share of revenue from the sale of team 
merchandise, retirement benefits and the right to challenge 
disciplinary action. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly no one is saying the women get what the men get. But  
I think it is unfair that the women get about 1 1/2 percent of what 
the men get,'' said Bruce Levy, an agent for about three dozen WNBA 
players. ``Something is very, very wrong. I don't see how the 
league on the one hand can plead poverty and on the other hand 
refuse to give any financial data to back that up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ackerman said the league proposal increases player compensation  
for the first year by 30 percent. It includes year-round health and 
dental benefits, pension and maternity benefits, life insurance, 
and creation of an advisory panel to give players input into league 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Ackerman said the value of the league's salary and benefits  
package averages $60,000. ``We allow our players to play 
elsewhere,'' she said. ``We ask only a four-month commitment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A union official, speaking on the condition he not be  
identified, said the league has offered a $20,000 minimum, while 
the union has lowered its demand from $60,000 to $55,000 to 
$45,000. The sides agree they are about $2 million apart, the union 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Levy estimated that the WNBA generated about $25 million in  
profits above its projections for its first two seasons. Only 
recently did the league propose to extend insurance through the 
entire year rather having coverage only during the season. Levy 
said it was prompted by the plight of Houston Comets point guard 
Kim Perrot, who was diagnosed with lung cancer and brain tumors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that was a tremendous embarrassment, that she didn't  
have insurance,'' Levy said. ``It would have put her in debt for 
life. I believe they said they would cover it. It's outrageous, the 
height of hypocrisy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also at issue is the disposition of players from the ABL.  
Ackerman said the WNBA would like a maximum of four ABL players on 
the rosters of the 10 existing teams, with the expansion teams from 
Minnesota and Orlando allowed to carry six each. The union has 
asked a limit of two ABL players for each of the 12 WNBA 
franchises. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've taken the position that for the good of women's  
basketball, we don't believe it's appropriate to restrict the 
influx of players from any origin,'' Ackerman said. ``We want to 
showcase the best women's basketball players in the world, 
regardless of their origin. We're not aware of any league that 
restricts eligibility.''

<HEADLINE> Jodie Foster Suffers Ankle Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Jodie Foster suffered a minor  
ankle injury during a break from work on the film ``Anna and the 
King.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foster was treated at a hospital Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	The injury was not expected to set back work on the $60 million  
project being filmed on the popular Malaysian resort island. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster is co-starring in the 20th Century Fox remake of ``The  
King and I'' along with Hong Kong action hero Chow Yun Fat. The 
film is about a 19th century governess hired by King Mongkut of 
Siam, now Thailand, to teach his children English.

	Thailand has traditionally objected to the story as historically  
incorrect, and barred Hollywood from shooting the film in Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Mom Implicates Son in Ark. Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Tears streaming down her face, the  
mother of a man accused in a murderous plot to set up a whites-only 
country testified Wednesday that her son once told her about 
killing a gun dealer and his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Gloria Kehoe said her son, Chevie, bragged that he put the  
victims on ``a liquid diet'' by tossing their bodies into a bayou. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking across the courtroom at her son afterward, she said:  
``It's got to be told, Chevie. There's wrong and there's right. God 
won't let me live with it anymore. I'm very sorry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chevie Kehoe, 26, of Colville, Wash., and Danny Lee, 26, of  
Yukon, Okla., are charged with racketeering, conspiracy and murder 
in an alleged plot to overthrow the government and set up the 
whites-only Aryan Peoples Republic in the Pacific Northwest. They 
could get the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, they are accused of murdering gun dealer  
William Mueller, his wife, Nancy, and their daughter in January 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	When Mrs. Kehoe took the stand, she used sign language to tell  
her son, ``I love you.'' She then told jurors how her son told her 
that he and Lee donned FBI outfits, entered the Muellers' Tilly, 
Ark., home and waited. They took the family by surprise, bound 
their hands with plastic ties and told them they were being 
arrested, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said that Lee and her son gave the three electric shocks on  
the neck to make them pass out, believing they were acting humane. 
Then the pair put plastic over the Muellers' heads, she said, 
adding that Kehoe beat Mueller in the head with the butt of a 
shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
	She said her son told her he ``put Bill and Nancy on a liquid  
diet and thought it was just a joke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the middle of telling the story, Mrs. Kehoe turned to her son  
and said: ``You know it's right, Bud. Don't look at me that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Kehoe testified that she confirmed much of her son's story  
in later conversations with Lee. 
</P>
<P>
	On cross-examination, Mrs. Kehoe agreed with some suggestions  
that her husband was a tyrant and that Chevie committed crimes to 
please him. 
</P>
<P>
	The court session came to an abrupt end when defense lawyer Tom  
Sullivan began asking Mrs. Kehoe about the Christian Identity 
Movement, to which she and her husband belonged. 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan asked how members felt about pedophilia. He then asked  
specifically about how members of her family felt about the 
subject. After prosecutors objected, Mrs. Kehoe ran from the 
courtroom.

<HEADLINE> Revlon To Sell Some Divisions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After two weeks of rumors that sent Revlon  
shares soaring, billionaire Ronald O. Perelman put the cosmetic 
company's future up in the air Wednesday, announcing plans to sell 
one or more of its struggling businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Revlon, which makes Revlon and Almay makeup, Flex shampoo and  
Charlie perfume, has seen its shares surge 70 percent in the past 
two weeks amid rumors the company was a takeover target. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's much more likely they would sell the whole company,''  
said Tim Drake, a senior equity analyst at Banc One Investment 
Advisors, which owns about 350,000 shares of Revlon. ``The true 
value of the company is in the Revlon brand and the Revlon name.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation of potential bidders has included Unilever NV, the  
maker of Calvin Klein and Elizabeth Arden cosmetics and fragrances, 
and Procter &AMP; Gamble Co., which owns the Max Factor and Cover Girl 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
	The company did not elaborate on its plans, and spokesman Walter  
Montgomery said, ``It's premature to speculate on any specific 
course of action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The money from any deal would be used to pay down Revlon's $1.66  
billion in debt, much of it borrowed when Perelman bought the 
company in 1985 for $1.83 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Founded in 1934 by Charles Revson and Joseph Lachman, the  
company made its name in the business by introducing nail polish 
and matching lipsticks in fashion colors. 
</P>
<P>
	Revlon, which now uses model Cindy Crawford to hype its new  
shades, is a dominant player at cosmetic counters in drugstores 
like Eckerd and Rite Aid, and discount stores like Target and 
Wal-Mart. 
</P>
<P>
	But the competition is cutthroat.  
</P>
<P>
	Crowding the market with L'Oreal and Estee Lauder are aggressive  
rivals such as Procter &AMP; Gamble, which is launching a makeup line 
for its Oil of Olay brand, and Johnson &AMP; Johnson, which just 
introduced a Neutrogena-brand makeup. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, companies like Gap and Victoria Secrets are  
launching their own makeup and body care lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a whole new market share war going on,'' said Allan  
Mottus, editor of The Informationist, an industry trade 
publication. Revlon's ``business has slowed down, and they have to 
invest more in new products and advertising to compete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's hard for debt-laden Revlon to do, having earned just $8.5  
million from continuing operations last year on flat sales of $2.25 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the recent run up in Revlon's stock, the shares remains  
58 percent below where it stood last April. 
</P>
<P>
	Perelman, chairman and chief executive of Revlon, owns 83  
percent of the company's stock through his firm MacAndrews &AMP; 
Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	For Perelman, who started as a small businessman in Philadelphia  
and became one of the richest men in America, Revlon is the latest 
in a string of problems. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to a costly and high-profile custody battle with his  
third wife, Perelman's investments in Marvel Comics, Sunbeam and 
Consolidated Cigar have all had their troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	What's more, despite Perelman's efforts to restructure Revlon,  
the company seems to attract unflattering press. 
</P>
<P>
	The cosmetics company was in the news recently after George  
Fellows, Revlon president, paid for the New York Police 
Commissioner to fly to Hollywood for the Oscars during the 
investigation of the shooting death of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed 
immigrant, by four policemen. 
</P>
<P>
	The news that Perelman has hired two investment banks to explore  
options for Revlon buoyed investors Wednesday. Revlon's stock rose 
$3.56 1/4, or nearly 18 percent, to $23.56 1/4 on the New York Stock 
Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Hero Sailor Poised To Win Solo Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Giovanni Soldini already is a hero. Now he can become a  
champion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian sailor has a 10-day lead heading into the fourth and  
final leg of the Around Alone yacht race, a 27,000-mile, nine-month 
odyssey that takes solo sailors through some of the world's most 
treacherous seas. 
</P>
<P>
	With that kind of cushion, he could sail backward for several  
days and still win. Still, he knows that Atlantic winds are fickle 
-- and remembers his embarrassment there on the first leg, where one 
tactical mistake left him too close to the ocean calms and 500 
miles behind his competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine sailors -- down from an original fleet of 16 -- will take off  
April 10 from Punta del Este, Uruguay, heading through the tropics 
to Charleston, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	More than the scenery changes: Sailors have spent the last few  
weeks stripping their boats of heavy weather gear as the course 
shifts from a roller-coaster survival run into a tricky, tactical 
upwind dance along the South American coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The race itself was wide open until the third leg, when the  
sailors left Auckland, New Zealand, on Feb. 5 to traverse the 
unpredictable waters around Cape Horn. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the carnage began. Within days, Josh Hall of Britain lost  
his mast and was out of the race; Isabelle Autissier, a heavy 
favorite to win, flipped and could not right her 60-foot yacht, 
PRB; Marc Thiercelin, a fellow French native who was her main 
rival, saw his 80-foot mast crumple and smash a large hole in his 
deck. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was lucky that my head was not cut off,'' Thiercelin said at  
the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Into it all rode Soldini, barreling through 30-foot seas to find  
Autissier's upside-down boat 22 hours later in a Pacific region so 
remote that national rescue agencies would not venture into it. 
Taking only her passport, Autissier opened her boat's final hatch 
and sent her million-dollar racing machine to the ocean floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I am here today, if I am able to speak to you, to laugh or  
cry or whatever, it is because Giovanni came,'' she told the 
hundreds who greeted her and Soldini when they arrived March 3 in 
Punta del Este. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, I am sad about my boat, but to be alive is  
better,'' she added. 
</P>
<P>
	Autissier, one of the finest single-handed sailors, gave up her  
decade-long quest to win the race and announced her retirement. 
Soldini earned a medal of heroism from Italy -- and the deep 
admiration of thousands following the race on its Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Thiercelin made a makeshift mast, saw his lead evaporate into a  
huge deficit and was vilified in cyberspace for not coming to 
Autissier's aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldini and Thiercelin are all that's left of Class I, for boats  
up to 60 feet. In Class II, for boats up to 50 feet, Jean-Pierre 
Mouligne of France has a nearly an eight-day lead and is the 
favorite to win. 
</P>
<P>
	But the racing spirit has not been lost -- a fight for second has  
emerged between 54-year-old Mike Garside of Britain and Brad Van 
Liew, 31, of Santa Monica, Calif., the youngest sailor and only 
American left. 
</P>
<P>
	After 35 strenuous days on the second leg, the two Class II  
racers arrived in Auckland within 2 1/2 minutes of each other -- the 
closest finish in race history. Garside has a 9 1/2-hour lead over Van 
Liew going into the fourth leg. 
</P>
<P>
	``This race-within-a-race has definitely increased the stress  
level,'' Van Liew said from Punta del Este, where he was 
overhauling his boat and trying to gain back some of the 30 pounds 
he had lost on the third leg. ``The next leg, all the gloves are 
off.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Dolphins RB Spikes Faces Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Former Miami Dolphins running back  
Irving Spikes' legal troubles are mounting. 
</P>
<P>
	The 28-year-old Spikes was indicted last week in Fort  
Lauderdale, charged with cocaine conspiracy and possession with 
intent to distribute. Each federal count carries a minimum 
mandatory five-year prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Spikes was jailed last month in Gulfport, Miss., on federal drug  
and weapon charges, including selling cocaine to a teammate while 
still a player with the Dolphins. He awaits trial there. 
</P>
<P>
	In that indictment, Spikes also was charged with selling cocaine  
to a major drug dealer and participating in a shootout with the 
drug dealer outside the dealer's west Biloxi apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	Spikes played for the Dolphins from 1994 until 1998, when he was  
cut. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Mississippi indictment, FBI agent Jerome Lorrain  
testified that Spikes twice sold more than 4 pounds of cocaine to 
Dolphins teammate Derek Joiner and later sold him 4 pounds of fake 
cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	In the fake cocaine sale described by Lorrain, Spikes tried to  
convince Joiner that some wrapped sheetrock was cocaine. But when 
Joiner tried to inspect it, Spikes' partner pulled a gun and took 
$17,000 from the player.

<HEADLINE> Muser Defends Offerman Comment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Kansas City manager Tony Muser said he  
doesn't understand why people are ``making such a big deal'' out of 
his comments that Jose Offerman doesn't always hustle. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's obvious to a lot of people that Offie had periods when he  
didn't run the ball out,'' Muser said Wednesday prior to the 
Royals' game against Boston, the team Offerman left Kansas City to 
join. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not something that's dreamt up or anything. I lot of  
people saw that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, his third with the Royals and his first full year  
under Muser, Offerman had a breakthrough season with career-highs 
in batting average (.315), hits (191) home runs (7) and triples 
(13). 
</P>
<P>
	Offerman then bolted the cash-poor Royals and signed a  
four-year, $26 million free agent contract with the Red Sox. Muser 
made a few joking references to him during the Royals' winter 
awards dinner, saying, ``We'll get you, Offie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Offerman, after going 4-for-5 and leading the Red Sox past  
Kansas City 5-3 in the season opener, became angry when reminded 
that Muser had sometimes questioned his willingness to hustle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Muser can say say whatever he wants to say. I don't play for  
him anymore,'' Offerman said. ``I know I gave 100 percent every 
time for them. I hit .315 ... I hit 13 triples. What else am I 
supposed to do? That's stupid for him to say.''

<HEADLINE> Big Asian Markets Continue To Surge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asia's three biggest stock markets, Tokyo, Hong  
Kong and Singapore, extended their rallies Wednesday, while most 
smaller markets slid back after recent gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's blue chips reached a nearly nine-month high while Hong  
Kong's key index soared to its highest level in a year and 
Singapore shares rose to 17-month highs, amid signs that Japan's 
recession could be easing. Investors are betting that improved 
prospects for Japan could help end Asia's drawn-out economic 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is just gathering confidence on the part of  
overseas investors, that Asia has seen the worst, that economic 
recoveries are getting underway and that things are generally under 
control,'' said Howard Gorges, director of South China Brokerage 
Co. Ltd., in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong's blue-chip Hang Seng Index soared 4.9 percent, or  
541.89 points, to close at 11,614.87, the highest since it finished 
at 11,735.50 points on March 27, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng had rallied 1.2 percent on Thursday, the last  
trading day before the market closed for Easter and the Chinese 
grave-sweeping Ching Ming Festival. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were catching up with recent strong gains on Wall  
Street and the rest of Asia after the long break, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	They were optimistic that China is close to securing its entry  
to the World Trade Organization. Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji, who 
started his long-awaited U.S. visit Tuesday, said there had been a 
breakthrough on ongoing negotiations with the United States on 
farming issues, which would remove a major obstacle. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does seem almost certain that China will become a member  
during this year, and that of course will be good news for Hong 
Kong and China,'' Gorges said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, shares rose for the third straight day.  
</P>
<P>
	The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average climbed 74.79 points, or 0.45  
percent, closing at 16,554.50 points, its highest finish since July 
21, when the average closed at 16,556.69. 
</P>
<P>
	The average has gained 264.31 points in three days, including  
Tuesday's 144.93-point gain. 
</P>
<P>
	Miyoshi Okano, manager of the equity department with Cosmo  
Securities, said continued buying by U.S. investment funds led the 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the U.S. dollar slipped against the  
Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In late trading, the dollar bought 120.78 yen, down 0.28 yen  
from late Tuesday in Tokyo but above its late New York level of 
120.62 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	In Singapore, the Straits Times Index added another 1 percent,  
or 16.17 points, to close at 1,606.15. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark index, which is at a 17-month high, has soared 4.8  
percent in the past three days. 
</P>
<P>
	In Bangkok, Thailand, the key SET index jumped 8.79 points, or  
2.5 percent, to 359.52. 
</P>
<P>
	In South Korea, stock prices rallied for the sixth consecutive  
day, as market liquidity increased due to recent low interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kospi index gained 6.63 points, or 1 percent, to 673.36  
points. It had gained 12 percent in the past six days. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares fell, with little news to move the  
market. The JSX Composite Index fell 0.398 point, or 0.1 percent, 
to 395.911. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Stocks fell only slightly amid continued concerns  
over the health of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who is 
suffering from lung infection. The Composite index shed 0.06 
percent, or 0.36 point, to 556.57. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine stocks rose on the release of favorable  
inflation data and expectations that the central bank may once 
again reduce banks' reserve requirements. The PSE index rose 26.81 
points, or 1.3 percent, to 2,070.17. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian shares fell, despite the continuing surge in  
market heavyweight News Corp. The All Ordinaries index closed at 
3,029.6, down 3.3 points, or 0.1 percent, from Tuesday's all-time 
high close of 3,032.9. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Taiwan shares fell in light volume, indicating investors  
are still waiting for more companies to release their March sales 
figures. The Weighted Price Index fell 28.10 points, or 0.39 
percent, to 7,135.89. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand shares fell, with the NZSE-40 capital

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Strikes Could Foil GOP Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The still-increasing costs of the U.S.  
confrontation with Yugoslavia are complicating Republican plans to 
deliver an election-year tax cut and their pledge to leave Social 
Security surpluses alone. 
</P>
<P>
	With private and government analysts saying the Kosovo crisis  
could cost the United States $2 billion or more, Congress will have 
to find a way to pay for it. Added to the price tag will be the 
expenses of moving 20,000 refugees to Guantanamo naval base in Cuba 
for what officials say may be a six-month stay. 
</P>
<P>
	The costs are likely to be dwarfed by the $111 billion federal  
surplus the Congressional Budget Office expects this year. But that 
surplus comes entirely from the Social Security trust fund -- money 
congressional Republicans have pledged not to use for anything 
other than helping senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're kind of stuck on their own rhetoric here,'' said  
Richard May, a consultant and former GOP staff director of the 
House Budget Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton is expected to propose using expected budget  
surpluses to pay the Yugoslavia expenses. But many Republicans are 
eager to avoid battling him over paying for troops even as they 
remain in the field, and numerous GOP aides predicted that Congress 
would go along and use the surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to be honest, that it's coming straight out of Social  
Security,'' said one Republican Senate leadership aide, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. The aide said Republicans could argue they 
promised to leave Social Security funds alone ``when we were not at 
war. You can't not pay for war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But that viewpoint is likely to be contested. Conservative Sen.  
Rod Grams, R-Minn., said he would prefer to pay the Yugoslavia 
costs by making across-the-board cuts in other spending, even if it 
means a confrontation with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the one who ordered the bombing,'' Grams said. ``He  
should figure out a way to pay for it without putting the taxpayers 
in a hole.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the Yugoslavia crisis persists and Congress does not pay all  
the bills until fiscal 2000, which begins Oct. 1, Republicans face 
another problem. 
</P>
<P>
	They have promised an $800 billion, 10-year tax cut beginning in  
2000, as the presidential and congressional election campaigns are 
under way. Because virtually all of next year's surplus also will 
come from Social Security, Republicans have been planning a modest 
$15 billion tax cut for 2000 that would be paid for by raising 
revenue and cutting spending elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have been hoping to pump up the 2000 tax cut by  
using new, higher surplus estimates that are expected this summer. 
Concerned that the new surplus estimate for 2000 might be smaller 
than hoped for, Republicans now must worry that the costs of Kosovo 
might absorb much of the new money, leaving less for tax 
reductions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may imperil the tax cut in the sense that it won't be as  
big as some of us hoped,'' said Stephen Moore, budget analyst for 
the conservative-leaning Cato Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been no official cost estimates yet for the Balkan  
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	One federal official who spoke on condition of anonymity said  
the Pentagon has told White House officials that the price tag 
already has hit $500 million and could reach $2 billion soon -- 
excluding a massive infusion of U.S. ground troops or the costs of 
the refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	The Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a private  
research organization, estimates the cost of the first two weeks of 
bombing at $450 million to $600 million, said budget analyst Liesl 
Heeter.

<HEADLINE> Mariners' Rodriguez Out 4-6 Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Mariners shortstop Alex Rodriguez will miss 4-6  
weeks with torn cartilage in his left knee, becoming the latest 
star to be sidelined this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez, 23, will undergo surgery Thursday. Rodriguez injured  
himself while performing an agility exercise that involves jumping 
over boxes that are about as high as a chair. 
</P>
<P>
	An MRI exam on Wednesday showed that he has a torn medial  
meniscus. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Public Project To Preserve Films </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A $1.5 million public-private project to  
preserve hundreds of movies, such as Paul Robeson's ``The Emperor 
Jones'' and Frank Capra's World War II series ``Why We Fight,'' is 
being organized by a federally authorized foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials on Tuesday announced the millennium program, called  
Treasures of American Film Archives. The coordinators are the 
National Film Preservation Foundation, set up by Congress, and the 
National Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pew Charitable Trusts in Philadelphia is making a $200,000  
contribution on the heels of a $500,000 NEA grant in February. The 
American Film Institute and other industry groups have also 
contributed. 
</P>
<P>
	Altogether, 17 separate archives will take part, including five  
federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of movies, some only a few minutes long, will be copied  
onto modern film stocks. Workers will preserve a master copy, from 
which viewing copies will be made. 
</P>
<P>
	The Library of Congress will work on ``The Emperor Jones'' and a  
collection from the laboratories of inventor Thomas A. Edison. It 
will also preserve footage taken in the field by anthropologist 
Margaret Mead, author of the landmark ``Coming of Age in Samoa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Movies made before the 1950s were on highly flammable nitrate  
film, library officials say. Since then, newer and safer film stock 
has been used. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Archives will do the seven-film Capra series,  
commissioned by the War Department to overcome the isolationist 
feeling strong in the United States before World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke Ellington's baritone saxophonist for 35 years, Harry  
Carney, took pictures of the orchestra between 1938 and 1941. The 
National Museum of American History will be in charge of those, and 
of shorts on communications technology that Western Union started 
more than 70 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Browns Still Mulling No. 1 Pick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The long-awaited Ricky Williams workout  
answered a few questions for the Browns. But it failed to clear up 
the biggest one: Who to take with the No. 1 pick? 
</P>
<P>
	Williams turned Cleveland's draft pick derby into a three-way  
dead heat on Tuesday with an impressive private workout for the 
Browns and nearly every other NFL team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's now a three-man race,'' Cleveland coach Chris Palmer said  
after watching Williams get tested for two hours at the University 
of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	The other players rated at the top of Cleveland's draft board  
are Oregon quarterback Akili Smith and Kentucky QB Tim Couch, 
who'll have a second chance to impress the Browns with another 
workout this Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	When Williams showed up 20 pounds overweight at the NFL scouting  
combines in February, there was speculation he might drop out of 
contention to be the first player selected in the April 17 draft. 
</P>
<P>
	But Williams dropped the weight -- he's at 224 -- and although his  
40-yard dash times Tuesday didn't drop any jaws, he has made the 
Browns' decision what to do with their No. 1 overall pick more 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer said the Browns are likely to use every second they're  
allotted before deciding what to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will go right into Saturday (April 17) morning,'' Palmer  
said, ``until minutes before the draft opens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams declined to work out at the combine in February, partly  
because he gained the weight on the banquet circuit after winning 
the Heisman Trophy following a record-setting senior season at 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	He clocked anywhere from a 4.6 to 4.72 on stopwatches running  
into the wind, and 4.4 to 4.52 wind-aided, Palmer said of Tuesday's 
workout. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, whom Palmer compared in body type to Earl Campbell,  
also bench pressed 225 pounds 22 times during the strength portion 
of his workout and showed he had good hands. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's anything he did in the workout that  
changed our mind on him one way or another,'' said Palmer. 
``Obviously, we thought he did excellent here. We're still in a 
toss-up as who will be the No. 1 pick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Palmer joked that if Williams' 40 time was in the 4.3  
range, he might as well be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of 
Fame now. 
</P>
<P>
	``He ran the way we expected him to after seeing him on film,''  
Palmer said. ``There is football speed and there is track speed. 
When you watch him on film, he runs away from people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And what about Canton?  
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's definitely a player who has a chance to go to  
Canton,'' Palmer said. ``And I think he's a player who's worthy of 
the first pick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the Browns' draft day dilemma is the possibility a  
team 
</P>
<P>
	wanting Williams or Couch or Smith bad enough, could make  
Cleveland a deal it can't refuse. 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans coach Mike Ditka has already offered all his team's  
picks for the chance to move up and get Williams. Palmer spoke with 
Saints general manager Bill Kuharich at Williams' workout, and said 
he expects to hear from New Orleans again.

<HEADLINE> 'National Desk' Discusses Feminism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The latest edition of PBS' ``The National  
Desk,'' a series that brings a provocative conservatism to 
television, has women on its mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, is feminism dangerous to the well-being of boys?  
Do women in combat roles compromise the military? And has Title IX 
struck out as a way to level the athletic playing field for male 
and female students? 
</P>
<P>
	Let the shouting begin. The trio of ``National Desk'' programs  
is designed to foster debate with a blunt approach that, depending 
on one's perspective, can be invigorating, infuriating or both. 
</P>
<P>
	``The War on Boys,'' 9 p.m. EDT Friday, April 9 (check local PBS  
listings), opens the series. It is followed by ``Politics and 
Warriors: Women in the Military,'' Friday, April 16, and ``Title IX 
and Women in Sports: What's Wrong With This Picture,'' Friday, 
April 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Political commentator Fred Barnes is host of the first chapter,  
which suggests that a unisex society that refuses to distinguish 
between men and women creates an unhealthy atmosphere for children 
-- that is, boys. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to be taught that the distinction between the genders  
is not prejudice. It's not negative. It's not bad for them. It's 
just recognizing reality,'' says psychologist Diane Medved. 
</P>
<P>
	Boys are more aggressive and less emotionally open, according to  
experts quoted in the program. One cites toy company research in 
which children were brought in to play with a doll house and its 
contents. 
</P>
<P>
	The girls played nicely; the boys tucked a baby doll into its  
buggy and catapulted it from the roof of the house. That's nature, 
not nurture, according to ``The War on Boys.'' And messing with 
nature has severe consequences. 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to subdue boys, they are overmedicated with drugs  
intended for attention deficit disorder. They are derided for 
naturally masculine behavior. And, worse yet, they are snubbed 
academically while girls are favored, the program argues. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged villain in the piece is a 1992 study from the  
American Association of University Women that found that girls 
suffered from low self-esteem and were being shortchanged by the 
educational system, lagging behind boys in subjects such as math. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is boys, the program insists, who are truly at danger,  
suffering from high suicide rates and getting short shrift in 
schools designed for the learning habits of girls and controlled by 
women teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	(Conspicuously ignored by the program: equally worrisome  
behavioral problems among female adolescents, including anorexia 
and bulimia eating disorders.) 
</P>
<P>
	The next episode, ``Politics and Warriors,'' contends that our  
national defense is being weakened because women are getting 
military career opportunities for which they are physically 
unsuited. MSNBC's Laura Ingraham is the host. 
</P>
<P>
	``Common sense should tell us when we use the military as a  
laboratory of social engineering we risk compromising and 
undermining the readiness, cohesiveness, the very effectiveness of 
our armed forces,'' Ingraham says. 
</P>
<P>
	A climate of ``fem fear'' has been created among military  
leaders and others in government who bow to feminist demands to 
protect their jobs, claims Elaine Donnelly, president of the 
civilian Center for Military Readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	Is America dominated by self-serving women? The high-ranking  
female officers we hear from in the documentary seem to have no 
other agenda in mind than to serve their country as best they can. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unsettling to see footage of women soldiers struggling to  
complete basic training exercises and to consider how they would 
fare in a ground war. Whether a picture is worth a thousand words 
on this complex topic, however, is open to question. 
</P>
<P>
	The final hour, ``Title IX and Women in Sports,'' is helmed by  
broadcaster and columnist Larry Elder who, like Ingraham and 
Barnes, pulls no punches when it comes to the issue at hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Elder believes the civil rights legislation is well-meaning in  
spirit but rotten in execution. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Congress passed Title IX, which guaranteed equal  
opportunity for females in high school and college sports, the 
number of girls competing in high school sports has grown at least 
eightfold. Women now get about 37 percent of all athletic college 
scholarship money. 
</P>
<P>
	But athletic directors detail what seems to be a Catch-22  
situation: To give women more, they have to give men less. So 
Syracuse University moves to cut men's wrestling, the University of 
California at Los Angeles does the same with several programs and 
male students are unfairly penalized, say Title IX detractors. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonsense, respond female athletes and the law's supporters  
interviewed on the program. They argue that colleges can find a way 
to serve both men and women if they try, especially if they stop 
lavish overspending on high-profile football programs. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a real strength of ``National Desk.'' Although its hosts  
and many of its talking heads tend to line up on the right, the 
program does give ample time to those in disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
	For viewers and society, of course, the debate is wide open --  
and unending. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Bad Breadth / Commentary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *AP Business Analyst    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Is bad breadth a sign of a more serious ailment?  
Wall Streeters are asking that question as gains in the popular 
averages are limited to fewer and fewer companies. 
</P>
<P>
	In popular thinking, the well-known averages such as the Dow  
Jones industrials and Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 reflect the market as a 
whole, but increasingly the evidence shows they don't. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the 15 largest stocks in the S&AMP;P 500 accounted for  
more than half the index's 28.57 percent gain. And the average New 
York Stock Exchange issue actually declined as the market rose. 
</P>
<P>
	Such evidence is sharply at odds with popular impressions that a  
new era of abundance has been reached for stocks as a whole. And it 
has created questions about some popular theories of investing. 
</P>
<P>
	One such question involves diversification, which is almost  
routinely recommended by theorists who otherwise have little in 
common. A diverse portfolio, it is said, provides protection. 
</P>
<P>
	The experience, however, is different. Of late, you'd have done  
better investing in a concentrated rather than diverse portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
	You might choose from a list of very large companies, or growth  
or technology companies, for example, and then only on a few rather 
than many. On some days, when averages rise, most stocks fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The narrowness of the market has also provoked doubts about the  
chances of small-capitalization stocks to keep pace. Despite 
optimistic forecasts, many good small stocks seem stuck in the 
doldrums. 
</P>
<P>
	Explanations for the lack of breadth are still tentative, and it  
is, of course, not beyond possibility that there could be a sudden 
or gradual shift to a more broadly based, less restrictive market. 
</P>
<P>
	For the time being, however, one reasonable theory is that large  
companies are more able than smaller companies to perform well in a 
competitive world economy -- able to earn profits by cutting costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Such an analysis, says economist Edward Yardeni of Deutsche Bank  
Securities, isn't a happy one for small companies. ``They don't 
have as much access to global markets,'' he says. ``They don't have 
resources to innovate and to leverage innovations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Preston Athey, manager of the T. Rowe Price Small-Cap Value  
Fund, disagrees. To believe that large-cap and Internet stocks are 
the only investments, he says, flies in the face of experience. 
</P>
<P>
	He concedes that ``what we have today are the lowest valuations  
for small-caps (relative to large caps) for as far back as we can 
go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he also believes that ``eventually, investors will have to  
look again at more nimble and innovative small companies to find 
rapid earnings growth or undiscovered bargains.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While that might be so, you have to wonder if those nimble small  
companies have enough shares outstanding to accept the huge buy and 
sell orders of large institutions, which dominate the market. 
</P>
<P>
	And if the institutions that move the market are limited by law  
to the amount of shares they can own in individual small companies, 
how will the small-caps rise?

<HEADLINE> Bruce, E Streeters Together Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For most of the world, it is THE tour of the  
year: Bruce Springsteen's much-anticipated reunion with his E 
Street Band, their first extended performances together in a 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	For the 49-year-old Springsteen, whose ties with the band reach  
across three decades to afternoons playing Monopoly and nights 
playing long-lost Jersey clubs, the tour is more about the most 
important friendships of his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``How many people know people they knew in their teens, and in  
their late 40s they're still sharing that closeness?'' Springsteen 
asked recently, just after tour rehearsals began. ``It's unusual. 
... I knew Steven when I was 16, and I'll know him when we're 86. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're only at the halfway point.''  
</P>
<P>
	Steven is guitarist Steven Van Zandt, one of the Boss' old  
Asbury Park, N.J., cronies, a friend who opened his home to 
Springsteen 30 years ago when the Boss' parents moved to 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	Saxophonist Clarence Clemons, bassist Garry Tallent and  
keyboardist Danny Federici have known Springsteen roughly as long; 
they played the shore's bars and beach clubs with Springsteen 
before anybody west of the Garden State Parkway ever heard the E 
Street Band. 
</P>
<P>
	Drummer Max Weinberg and pianist Roy Bittan joined the band in  
time for 1975's ``Born to Run.'' The ``new'' members came aboard in 
1984: guitarist Nils Lofgren replaced Van Zandt, and singer Patti 
Scialfa -- now Springsteen's wife and mother of their three children 
-- was added as a backup singer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone wants to know how I feel about the band,''  
Springsteen said to an appreciative crowd at his Rock and Roll Hall 
of Fame induction. ``Hell, I married one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While a public 1989 divorce with the other E Streeters led to  
some hard feelings, time soon healed any rifts. 
</P>
<P>
	The band reassembled in 1995 to record four songs for a greatest  
hits package; a video capturing those sessions was also released. 
Later that year, they played the Hall of Fame concert in Cleveland, 
backing both Springsteen and Jerry Lee Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	When Springsteen called again four years later, the band quickly  
re-formed -- and their bandleader couldn't be happier. 
</P>
<P>
	``After all that time not playing together, to come back like  
this is a good thing,'' Springsteen said. ``Everybody's playing 
better than when they left. Everybody did different things during 
that time, and people came back with broader perspectives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were solo careers: Van Zandt, Clemons, Lofgren and  
Federici all released albums to varying degrees of success (none 
approaching Springsteen's success). Bittan did session work, and 
toured with Springsteen's new band in 1992-93. Tallent became a 
well-known Nashville record producer. 
</P>
<P>
	Television called, too: Weinberg was hired as the bandleader for  
``Late Night With Conan O'Brien,'' and Van Zandt recently made his 
acting debut as mobbed-up strip club owner Silvio Dante on HBO's 
acclaimed series ``The Sopranos.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But all will be on-stage when the tour officially kicks off  
April 9 in Barcelona, Spain. Why? Sure, there's a big payday. But 
there are other, more ethereal factors. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Marsh, in his 1979 Springsteen biography ``Born to Run,''  
wrote that ``the original Asbury Park musicians have bonds 
unfathomed -- and unbreakable -- by outsiders.'' That was 20 years 
ago, before the bonds grew tighter, before the friends shared 
weddings, christenings, worldwide success. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an unusual thing,'' Springsteen said of the band's ties.  
``It's hard to explain. It's a very small group that's shared some 
very, very intense experiences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first week of practice found the band picking up as if they  
had never put down their instruments. They ripped through 40 songs 
that first week; Van Zandt has said that he expects the band to 
know more than 150 songs when they hit the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure how many we'll learn,'' Springsteen said with a  
laugh. ``But I'm sure we'll play 'em all by the time we're done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Springsteen said the band is playing songs ``from the whole body  
of my work,'' meaning concertgoers can expect to hear anything from 
``Spirit in the Night'' to electric versions of songs from ``The 
Ghost of Tom Joad.'' (A March rehearsal show in Asbury Park's 
Convention Hall included both.) 
</P>
<P>
	Springsteen's concerts have long been chock-full of surprises,  
from cover tunes (anything from Gary U.S. Bonds' ``Quarter to 
Three'' to Steppenwolf's ``Born to Be Wild'') to unreleased songs 
(the rehearsal included one titled ``Land of Hope and Dreams'') to 
extended jams (just about anything). 
</P>
<P>
	One thing that has pleased Springsteen about the reunion: His  
older music held up well in rehearsals. 
</P>
<P>
	``The music resonates,'' Springsteen says. ``It takes the years  
real well. It's exciting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The excitement continues across Europe -- including Munich,  
Zurich, London, Dublin and Paris -- before that leg wraps up in 
Madrid through at least early June, with the first U.S. dates in 
mid-July and the last near the end of September. 
</P>
<P>
	Although playing with the band is a major attraction,  
Springsteen has acknowledged that his decision to tour with the E 
Streeters is in part a response to clamoring from his loyal fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do what's interesting, what's best at the moment,''  
Springsteen said when his box set ``Tracks'' was released. ``But 
the audience factors in, sure. I've had a long ongoing dialogue 
with my audience, and a dialogue goes two ways. 
</P>
<P>
	``They talk to me, and I talk to them.''  
</P>
<P>
	For many Springsteen fans, their ties with the Boss go back a  
quarter-century, too -- almost as long as the band. This year, it's 
Springsteen's turn to talk. And his audience can't wait to listen.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Customs Commissioner Raymond Kelly plans to  
announce the creation of an independent review panel Thursday to 
evaluate complaints of racial bias by inspectors who search airline 
passengers for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Customs Service is facing at least a dozen lawsuits  
over strip searches, including an effort by almost 100 black women 
to file a class-action suit in Chicago alleging they were singled 
out because of their race and gender. 
</P>
<P>
	Customs officers use strip searches, body cavity searches and  
X-rays to catch smugglers who hide cocaine or heroin inside their 
clothes or swallow packets of the drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Complaints and news reports about strip searches at Atlanta's  
Hartsfield International Airport led Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., to 
request a formal Treasury Department investigation of what he 
called ``a systematic and deliberate pattern of profiling African 
Americans'' and stopping them for searches. 
</P>
<P>
	Customs spokesman Dennis Murphy declined Wednesday to give  
details about the makeup of the commission, which Kelly planned to 
announce at a news conference Thursday with Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy described the idea generally as, ``Let's get somebody to  
come in and look at our procedures to make sure what we are doing 
here is not biased.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only 50,000 of the 69 million international air travelers who  
passed through Customs in 1997 were subjected to some level of body 
search, most of them simple pat-downs, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty percent of those subjected to body searches or X-rays were  
black or Hispanic, Customs statistics show. Drugs were found on 31 
percent of the blacks searched, 33 percent of Hispanics and 26 
percent of whites. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly, who took office last August, has already taken several  
steps to respond to complaints that body searches were too 
traumatic for passengers who are innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	They include requiring sensitivity training for inspectors,  
testing new body-imaging technology to replace some pat-down 
searches, and plans to add X-ray machines at airports so suspects 
won't have to be taken to hospitals in handcuffs for the procedure.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Yes It's True took the lead at the gate  
and pulled away to a five-length victory in the $107,000 Lafayette 
Stakes at Keeneland on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes It's True, a son of 1988 Breeders' Cup Juvenile winner Is It  
True, broke quickly from the second post position and settled near 
the rail. Fantastic Finish pulled to within a head a few strides 
later, but Yes It's True took control midway through the turn. 
</P>
<P>
	The colt covered seven furlongs in 1:22 and paid $2.40 and  
$2.10. 
</P>
<P>
	Trickey Crew rallied to finish five lengths behind in second and  
returned $2.10. Fort La Roca was another 1 1/2 lengths behind in 
third. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes It's True is expected to run next in the Derby Trial, the  
opening day stake of the upcoming Churchill Downs meet.

<HEADLINE> Y2K Drill To Test Power Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Among the many Year 2000 disaster  
scenarios that have been envisioned is one where power fails in 
regions across the country, leaving thousands -- if not millions -- 
without power. 
</P>
<P>
	With this in mind, power plant operators across the country plan  
to hold a nationwide drill Friday to make sure they can keep the 
juice flowing if Y2K computer glitches prevent them from 
communicating with each other. 
</P>
<P>
	The drill is one of a series being conducted by the utility  
companies prior to Jan. 1, 2000 to test their vital systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Plant operators depend on telephone and fiber-optic lines and  
microwave transmitters to get continuous data readouts of each 
others' power generation levels, demand for electricity and other 
factors so they can send crucial kilowatts over the national power 
grid to regions that need it the most. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the drill, power plants will pretend that this data  
is unavailable, requiring them to share the information in other 
ways. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to simulate loss of communication functions, which  
is the bugaboo and something we don't have control of,'' said Gregg 
Fishman, spokesman for the Sacramento Municipal Utility District. 
``We will go to backup communications, which basically is guys out 
at the substations with handheld radios.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Communications is especially important during times of high  
demand, severe weather or if plants are disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, for instance, Florida power authorities had  
to cope with the possibility of outages due to high temperatures 
and power plants that were down for routine maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
	The test date, April 9, was chosen because it is the 99th day of  
1999, a number experts fear might read as an error message in some 
computer programs, since some programmers once typed in a series of 
9s as placeholders. While electricity companies don't believe the 
date will cause any glitches, they want to be prepared. 
</P>
<P>
	The larger problem, known sometimes as the Y2K bug, is that  
older computer programs and chips used only two digits. When 2000 
rolls around, some programs might think it is 1900, resulting in 
anything from calculation mistakes to outright failures. 
</P>
<P>
	The North American Electric Reliability Council, a nonprofit  
industry group in Princeton, N.J, was asked by the U.S. Department 
of Energy to take a leadership role in making sure electrical 
utilities are ready for the Year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	NERC reported in January that there likely will be ``only  
minimal impact'' on electricity production and distribution, since 
utilities around the country have been fixing and replacing 
affected equipment and conducting test after test. 
</P>
<P>
	The Edison Electric Institute, the Washington, D.C.-based  
organization whose members generate about three-quarters of the 
country's electricity, has said all its member utilities will 
complete their testing and repairs by June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Utilities and others involved in power transmission can design  
their own scenarios for Friday's drill, as long as they involve 
failure of current communication systems and use of backup systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is more to focus on communications within a utility,''  
says Mike Tyndall, spokesman for the Atlanta-based Southern 
Company, the largest U.S. electricity producer. 
</P>
<P>
	Power production figures from all the plants of Southern's five  
subsidiaries are usually fed electronically to the company's 
central nerve center in Birmingham, Ala., Tyndall explained. 
</P>
<P>
	For the drill, people will be standing at plants and  
substations, reading the data and calling it into the nerve center 
over wireless phones, Tyndall said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hydroelectric power plants, such as Keswick Dam on Shasta Lake  
in northern California, will use a microwave antenna as a backup 
communications system. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the scenarios we're interested in practicing for is if  
we lose telephones at the same time we're dealing with flood 
concerns,'' said Larry Ball, chief of operations and electrical 
maintenance for the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation at Keswick. 
</P>
<P>
	NERC plans to post a brief assessment of the drill results on  
its Internet site on Friday and plans a more detailed assessment in 
three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	NERC is also planning another national Year 2000 exercise for  
Sept. 9, 1999, another date that computer experts say could cause 
problems (9/9/99), but the nature of that exercise has not yet been 
determined.

<HEADLINE> Final Opener at Candlestick Point </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- It will be the final home opener for the  
Giants at their wind-swept ballpark at Candlestick Point, and the 
weather forecast is appropriate -- lots of rain is expected for 
Thursday's game against the San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	In the four decades since Vice President Richard Nixon presided  
over opening-day ceremonies for Candlestick Park in 1960 and 
proclaimed it ``the finest ballpark in America,'' the stadium built 
on landfill has caused nightmares for pitchers, hitters and -- 
especially -- fielders. 
</P>
<P>
	Popups turn into adventures. Pitchers have trouble keeping their  
fingers warm during summer day games. Hitters blast shots to left, 
only to see the wind turn them into fly balls to the center 
fielder. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your ball moves a ton out there and you can't judge the break  
on your breaking ball. It's hard to throw a strike,'' said Giants 
left-hander Shawn Estes, who is scheduled to start for San 
Francisco against San Diego's Stan Spencer -- who went to college at 
nearby Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been plenty of weird happenings at the ballpark,  
which will be replaced next year by Pacific Bell Park in downtown 
San Francisco: 
</P>
<P>
	-- A gust of wind blew Stu Miller off the mound during the 1961  
All-Star Game. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A game was delayed in 1964 after Los Angeles Dodgers center  
fielder Willie Davis lost a ball in the fog. 
</P>
<P>
	-- In 1993, a game against the Atlanta Braves was delayed for  
several minutes as a raccoon was chased off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	-- San Francisco's Bobby Murcer heated his bat in the clubhouse  
sauna before some plate appearances, and Pittsburgh coach George 
Sisler wrapped his legs with newspaper before putting on his 
uniform pants on one particularly cold night. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening day this year will feature former Giants slugger Orlando  
Cepeda, who was selected for the Hall of Fame last month, throwing 
out the ceremonial first pitch. The Giants are promoting it as the 
first day of a season-long ``Going Away Party'' for their old 
ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants come into the game having swept a three-game series  
in Cincinnati, winning each of the games by rallying in the eighth 
inning. On Wednesday, they scored seven runs in the eighth to win 
8-3 after being no-hit for six innings.

<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese automakers Mazda Motor Co. and Mitsubishi  
Motor Co. are discussing establishing a broad business and 
technological alliance, a newspaper reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks have already resulted in an agreement for Mazda to  
supply commercial vans to Mitsubishi, the Nihon Keizai business 
daily said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies released statements saying they had no comment on  
the report. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies plan to expand cooperation gradually with the  
possibility of involving Ford Motor Co., Mazda's largest 
shareholder, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nihon Keizai said that under the deal, Mitsubishi would halt  
production of commercial versions of its slumping Delica van model, 
and instead sell Mazda's Bongo vans under the Delica name. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies are considering the possibility of Mazda selling  
Mitsubishi minicars, thus replacing Suzuki Motor Corp. as its 
supplier of minicars, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies also are discussing an arrangement under which  
Mitsubishi would supply Mazda with its fuel-efficient engines and 
related technology, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Results of College Freshmen Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Some results from the 1998 survey of college freshmen:  
</P>
<P>
	--Nearly 83 percent of freshmen support the federal government  
doing more to control handguns. 
</P>
<P>
	--About 79 percent agree that employers can require drug tests of  
their workers. 
</P>
<P>
	--Thirty-three percent believe that homosexual relations should  
be prohibited, but about 49 percent believe same sex couples should 
have legal status. 
</P>
<P>
	--Nearly 73 percent believe there is too much concern for  
criminals, and only 23 percent favor abolishing the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	--Less than 33 percent support legalization of marijuana.  
</P>
<P>
	--About 82 percent attended a religious service in the past year,  
while 26 percent said they discussed religion over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	--Freshman reported high use of the Internet for social and  
academic purposes. In the year before the survey, nearly 83 percent 
had used the Internet for research or homework, and 54 had visited 
an Internet chat room.

<HEADLINE> Gasoline Futures, Coffee Fall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Gasoline futures prices plummeted Wednesday on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange, dragging most other energy futures lower, 
after weekly inventory figures showed only mild declines. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, coffee futures fell sharply, while copper  
futures moved sharply higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline futures retreated after the American Petroleum  
Institute reported inventories last week fell 555,000 barrels to 
215.44 million barrels, the fourth consecutive weekly decline. 
Investors had been expecting declines of about 2.8 million barrels 
as consumers filled tanks for the Easter holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Refinery outages in California, the nation's biggest consuming  
region, were also expected to contribute to production losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The disappointing inventory data, which implied American demand  
is far lower than presumed, led investors to ignore Venezuela's 
energy minister's comments that his country began full 
implementation of its latest oil production cuts on April 1, when 
an output reduction agreement among key oil producers was scheduled 
to begin. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil producers in the past have taken months to reduce output,  
and some still hadn't reached reductions agreed to a year ago. API 
figures showed crude imports last week still were about 8 percent 
higher than the five-year average. 
</P>
<P>
	Light, sweet crude for May delivery fell 78 cents to $16.03 a  
barrel; May unleaded gasoline fell 3.17 cents to 50.51 cents a 
gallon; May heating oil fell 2.68 cents to 41.27 cents a gallon; 
May natural gas rose 1.1 cent to $2.024 for each 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, North Sea Brent Blend crude oil for delivery in May  
settled at $14.35 per barrel, down 58 cents, at the International 
Petroleum Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee futures fell sharply on the Board of Trade of the City of  
New York amid fears the market will be flooded in coming days with 
Brazilian and Colombia imports. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilian trade ministry was selling as much as 250,000 bags  
of coffee weighing 132 pounds each at a monthly auction. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices also were pressured by talk Colombia may be considering  
devaluing its currency, a move that could result in a flood of 
exports from the world's second-largest grower. Since coffee is 
sold for dollars, there is an incentive to a producer with a weaker 
local currency to step up sales when the dollar is rising. 
</P>
<P>
	May arabica coffee fell 3.8 cents to $1.026 a pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Copper futures jumped on the New York Mercantile Exchange after  
inventory figures suggested world demand may be on the rise, 
particularly in the important Asian region. 
</P>
<P>
	The London Metal Exchange reported copper supplies at its  
warehouses around the globe fell 4,675 metric tons, or 0.65 
percent, to 711,750 tons. 
</P>
<P>
	While supplies remain high -- and prices hover at their lowest in  
12 years -- analysts said prices may rally further on expectations 
that construction demand for the metal in pipes and wiring could 
rise sharply in coming weeks as the onset of warmer weather 
increases building of homes and offices. 
</P>
<P>
	May copper rose 1.90 cents to 64.65 cents a pound.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farzad Naeim, an earthquake engineer from Los  
Angeles who decided to go to law school, didn't have time for 
campus meetings and classroom lectures. So when Kaplan's Concord 
Law School was launched last fall, Naeim enrolled to get his 
education through the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I figure if I go to a standard school four nights a week, that  
eliminates the chance for me to see my kids grow up,'' said Naeim, 
44. ``I get my assignments off the computer, and I can study after 
the kids go to bed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of universities are launching courses or degree  
programs online. But a pair of reports being released today 
question whether a seat in front of a computer is as good as a seat 
in a college classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	The reports' complaints range from whether the programs'  
effectiveness is evaluated properly and whether they cost too much 
to whether they are unfair to certain students. 
</P>
<P>
	The College Board warns in its report that Internet courses  
could hinder the progress of poor and minority students who arrive 
at college with less exposure to computers than white or 
more-affluent students. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's this rush to get online and go virtual. ... Colleges,  
policy-makers and (Internet) providers who are driving this market 
need to think about broad access,'' Larry F. Gladieux, a senior 
College Board researcher, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A second report, by the Institute for Higher Education Policy,  
says colleges still lack enough knowledge about Internet-based 
education to justify its rapid growth. For example, studies haven't 
explained a higher dropout rate for Internet-based learners -- 32 
percent compared with 4 percent for classroom students in one study 
-- or looked at whether students do better from Internet instruction 
alone or from a mix of Internet and classroom learning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of the studies suggest the grades of distance learners  
are higher or comparable,'' said Jamie Merisotis, president of the 
institute, which did the study for two teachers' unions. ``We don't 
know whether the poorer performers are dropping out at a higher 
rate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, 26,000 courses online teach roughly 750,000 students.  
They include the online law school and courses at Stanford 
University, the University of California, Los Angeles, and Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	The most visible advance, supporters say, is the first-time  
accreditation of a wholly online school: Students at Jones 
International University, operated out of Denver, now have such 
privileges as transferring credits and earning employer tuition 
reimbursements. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wondered if I was going to get a quality education,'' said  
Joan Crittenden, a Navy safety official from Waldorf, Md., who 
received her master's degree in business communications from Jones 
in December. ``I actually think I did get a better education. More 
of the resources were at my fingertips.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Distance learning started with classes taken by mail or by  
watching teachers' lectures on videos or cable television. But 
unlike correspondence school or video-lecture predecessors, 
Internet-based distance learning has a place on campus, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Deborah Everhart, a medieval studies professor at Georgetown  
University, holds classes off- and online, and says professors who 
have mastered e-mail now use Web pages to post course readings, 
homework and bulletin boards where students can leave messages. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are students I might not ordinarily hear from in  
class,'' Everhart said. ``But in a chat room, they feel freer to 
state their opinions and ask their questions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matthew Pittinsky is a co-founder of Washington-based Blackboard  
Inc., which creates and maintains Internet sites for college 
courses. ``There's no question, there is a market,'' Pittinsky 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Colleges' reliance on technology marketed by Blackboard, Real  
Education of Denver and Convene in San Francisco has led to 
criticism that the ventures are more about higher profits than 
higher learning. 
</P>
<P>
	College officials worried over enrollment increases and budget  
cuts could be easily seduced by pitches that virtual learning cuts 
the costs of ``bricks and mortar'' learning, College Board's 
Gladieux said. 
</P>
<P>
	But they need to ensure equal access, he said, noting that a  
technological divide still exists. For example, computers are in 75 
percent of households with incomes over $75,000, but just 20 
percent of households making less than $15,000 have computers or 
daily access. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Rosen of Kaplan notes that a law degree from Kaplan's  
Concord Law School costs up to $21,000, including the cost of a 
computer, rather than $80,000 for a more traditional law school. 
</P>
<P>
	``Online education has the potential to close a lot of the gaps  
that exist right now,'' Rosen said.

	Dow Closes at New High: 10,085.31  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average soared in the  
last hour of trading today and hit a new high as investors, nervous 
about upcoming earnings reports, sought the relative safety of 
blue-chip stocks. The Dow was up 121.82 points at 10,085.31, its 
third close above 10,000. Broader stock indicators were mixed, 
reflecting the fact that investors are for the time being turning 
away from unpredictable technology stocks and moving their money to 
blue-chips that are seen as surer bets. The Nasdaq composite index, 
heavily weighted in technology issues, fell 18.81 to 2,544.36, and 
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 8.86 to 1,326.75.

	Alcoa Leads Blue Chip Rise

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened strongly today as aluminum maker  
Alcoa released first-quarter earnings that soundly beat analysts' 
expectations. Alcoa, a component of the Dow, was up 2 13/16 to 43 7/8 
for the day. AT&AMP;T, another Dow stock, was up 4 13/16 at 84 15/16. 
The financial sector was mostly higher as analysts said banks and 
brokerages have hinted they will report strong earnings when they 
begin releasing first-quarter results next week. Chase Manhattan 
rose 5 1/8 to 84 3/8, and Merrill Lynch rose 5 1/8 to 96 1/4. A strong sales 
report from Ford Motor sent its shares up 2 1/2 to 60 3/4. Software maker 
Novell, meanwhile, slipped 1 1/8 to 22 15/16, and Sun Microsystems

	AMES, Iowa (AP) -- Shares of Engineering Animation Inc. plunged  
today after the company projected lower-than-expected profits and 
revenue for the first quarter. The producer of software for 
three-dimentional designing and animation cited a failure to close 
a half dozen contracts with large North American companies. Its 
stock was down 18 1/4, or 45.7 percent, at 21 11/16 on the Nasdaq 
Stock Market following the earnings warning last evening and an 
apologetic conference call today with analysts, investors and

	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- AMR Corp., parent company to American

work on resolving a dispute over the acquisition of Reno Air. At 
issue is the integration of Reno into American and when Reno's 
pilots will be upgraded to American's pay levels. In February, 
about 6,600 flights were canceled over a 10-day stretch as 
thousands of American pilots, frustrated with the talks, called in

	EU To Comply With WTO Banana Ruling  
</P>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Union said today it will  
abide by the decision of the World Trade Organization supporting 
U.S. claims that EU banana import rules violate WTO regulations. 
The WTO yesterday authorized the United States to impose $191 
million in 100 percent tariffs on European goods -- anything from 
sweaters to handbags and coffee makers. The amount of tariffs 
authorized was one-third of the U.S. demand of $520 million. The 
United States will be able to choose from a list of products that 
will get the tariffs. During the six-year battle, the United States 
has contended that EU rules unfairly discriminate against bananas 
grown by U.S. companies to favor bananas grown by former European 
colonies.

	China Telecom Broken Up Into 4 Cos.  
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China is breaking up the government's  
telecommunications monopoly into four specialized companies, a move 
that comes as U.S. and Chinese negotiators hold down-to-the-wire 
talks on China's bid to join the World Trade Organization. The 
long-awaited decision on the dismemberment of China Telecom would 
potentially open up a $28 billion market to foreign competition. 
China Telecom's tight grip on 95 percent of that market has been a 
major stumbling block in the WTO negotiations. Before setting out 
on his current U.S. visit, Premier Zhu Rongji reportedly said China 
would allow foreigners to take up to 30 percent stakes in 
telecommunications companies.

	Alcoa Reports Modest Income Growth  
</P>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Alcoa's earnings rose 5 percent for the first  
quarter, partly due to acquisitions and production efficiencies 
that offset falling aluminum prices. The results reported today 
beat Wall Street expectations. The world's biggest aluminum 
producer earned $221.1 million, or 60 cents a share, in the first 
three months of 1999 compared to $209.9 million, or 62 cents a 
share, a year ago. The per-share income declined because Alcoa 
increased the number of its common shares outstanding by 31 million 
to 367 million shares with its purchase of Alumax last July.

	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. blamed a lean inventory of  
its hottest-selling vehicle, the full-size Chevrolet Silverado 
pickup, for a March sales performance that lagged behind most of 
its competitors. GM said its U.S. sales were off 2 percent from a 
year ago -- lower than analysts had expected. While GM's car sales 
increased 1 percent, sales of light trucks were off 6 percent 
compared with the robust truck sales of March 1998. In the past 
week, Ford Motor Co. reported its March U.S. sales were up 14 
percent and DaimlerChrysler AG said its Chrysler unit posted a 17 
percent improvement. Most major foreign automakers also reported 
strong gains.

<HEADLINE> BNP To Continue Bank Takeover Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Banque Nationale de Paris said Wednesday it would  
press ahead with a takeover bid for French banks Paribas and 
Societe Generale, despite their clear opposition to the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The project is too important to give up now,'' BNP Chief  
Executive Michel Pebereau told Europe-1 radio. 
</P>
<P>
	The boards of Societe Generale and Paribas voted Tuesday to  
reject the BNP takeover bid, reiterating their confidence in plans 
for their own merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Societe Generale said the premium offered by BNP would ``either  
be very small, or even negative,'' making it unattractive for 
Societe Generale shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Societe Generale and Paribas were completing a $17.2 billion  
friendly merger of their own when BNP stunned the European 
financial world March 9 with an unsolicited $37 billion takeover 
bid for both banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-way merger put forward by BNP would create a $1  
trillion, world-leading banking group. It comes as European banks 
are joining forces to better compete in a market transformed by the 
region's new common currency, the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Societe Generale and Parabas say they prefer to pursue  
their own two-way merger -- SG Paribas -- which they believe has 
greater shareholder value. 
</P>
<P>
	Pebereau said Wednesday that BNP's three-way merger would bring  
benefits ``for workers, customers and shareholders.'' He said the 
matter might not be resolved for another three months.

	Yugoslavia Pounded by NATO Bombs  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslav television says six  
missiles have struck a town south of Belgrade early Thursday as 
NATO continues its bombing campaign. Large explosions are also 
reported in an industrial town north of the capital. In Belgrade 
itself, two loud blasts shook the city's center. A nearby resident 
says an army building was hit. Meanwhile, Yugoslav authorities have 
sealed off Kosovo's main border crossings, preventing ethnic 
Albanians from leaving as the wave of refugees approached the 
half-million mark.

	Cypriot Seeks Release of US Servicemen

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. officials indicated that NATO bombing of  
Belgrade would cease long enough Thursday to allow a Cypriot leader 
to fly in with the hope of bringing back the three U.S. soldiers 
held by Yugoslavia. Earlier, a pentagon spokesman said NATO would 
not stop its current operations because of the effort by Cypriot 
parliament leader Spyros Kyprianou to gain the release of the 
servicemen. But he said, ``We have total control of the operations 
and certainly if it's necessary to have an aircraft fly into an 
area or out of an area at any time, that could be arranged.''

	Clinton Pushes Equal Pay for Women  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton renewed his call Wednesday

opportunity of a generation'' to correct the inequity during good 
economic times. Clinton said Congress should take advantage of the 
nation's low unemployment and booming economy and pass the Paycheck 
Fairness Act introduced last month. The president's Council of 
Economic Advisers reported last year that women earn about 75 cents 
for every dollar a man earns, a narrower gap than in 1963, when 
President Kennedy signed the original Equal Pay Act. Then, women 
workers earned 58 cents for every dollar paid to male workers.

her lawyer comparing Kenneth Starr's tactics to the Third Reich. 
Jury deliberations were expected to begin Thursday. Throughout the 
five-week trial, McDougal's defense has been based on attacking the 
independent counsel's office. McDougal, charged with twice refusing 
to answer questions before a federal grand jury, testified that she 
feared prosecutors would charge her with perjury if she told the 
truth and did not implicate the Clintons.

<HEADLINE>  Duke Assistant Succeeds Stewart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) -- Quin Snyder got some advice from someone  
who knows a thing or two about coaching -- Mike Krzyzewski. The Duke 
coach told him to find a place worthy of his passion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now it's my turn to show you I'm worthy of this passion,''  
Snyder said Wednesday after being hired to succeed Norm Stewart as 
Missouri's basketball coach. ``I'm unbelievably excited about this 
opportunity. It's something I've dreamed about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder, born the year Stewart began coaching at Missouri, was  
the top assistant and recruiting coordinator under Krzyzewski the 
last four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	At 32, he becomes the youngest coach in the Big 12 and follows a  
coach who resigned only six days earlier after winning 634 games in 
32 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw in our brief meeting that fire, that conviction, that  
can lead us to a higher plane,'' chancellor Richard Wallace said. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder received a five-year contract and inherits a team that  
went 20-9 last season and lost to New Mexico in the first round of 
the NCAA tournament. He was the only one of the three finalists in 
Missouri's rapid-fire search with no head coaching experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to work like crazy,'' Snyder said. ``I'm as hungry  
as it gets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other finalists were John Calipari, recently fired by the New  
Jersey Nets, and Bill Self of Tulsa. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletic director Mike Alden said he didn't consult Stewart on  
the hire beyond informing him of the initial short list. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Missouri tied for second in the Big 12 last season, the  
Tigers have struggled in recent years. The NCAA tournament 
appearance was their first in four seasons, and nine players have 
transferred in the last five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like every kid from Kansas City to St. Louis to be  
thinking about playing for Missouri,'' Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
	The hire came on the first day of the late signing period, which  
runs through May 15. Missouri is looking to close the deal on three 
top recruits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't say we felt any pressure,'' Alden said. ``It had  
nothing to do with recruits. My pressure was with our 
student-athletes. I indicated we were going to hit the ground 
running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri is hoping Snyder's youth will help him connect with the  
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe he knows some of our music,'' freshman center Pat  
Schumacher said. ``That would be pretty cool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder, who also had been considered by Vanderbilt, San Diego  
State and Notre Dame, met briefly with his players before the news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made a little circle and had a little talk,'' Snyder said.  
``I think they're excited about what we're going to be doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freshman point guard Keyon Dooling had a mid-season falling out  
with Stewart and at one point had considered transferring. He was 
all smiles Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could feel the vibes,'' Dooling said. ``There were a  
number of good vibes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder plans an up-tempo offense.  
</P>
<P>
	``I want to see us push the ball,'' he said. ``I want to run.  
Can we run, guys?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder was the Duke point guard from 1986-89, making three trips  
to the Final Four. He is third on the school's career assist list. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been given a lot of credit for the development of  
sophomore point guard William Avery, who led the Blue Devils to a 
37-2 record and into the national championship game this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski, who underwent hip replacement surgery on Sunday,  
said during the Final Four he felt Snyder was ready to become a 
head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have had incredible high expectations for him as a player,  
then a coach, and as a friend,'' Krzyzewski said. ``He has 
surpassed my expectations in every way.''

<HEADLINE> Program Calculates Mutual Fund Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- How much will a 1 percent annual fee reduce  
the final account balance in a mutual fund investment over a 
20-year period? 
</P>
<P>
	A new computer program developed by federal regulators will help  
mutual fund investors find the answer. (It's 18 percent). 
</P>
<P>
	The Securities and Exchange Commission, led by Chairman Arthur  
Levitt, has been pushing the mutual fund industry for improved 
disclosure of fund fees and investment risks. 
</P>
<P>
	The program unveiled Tuesday ``takes some of the mystery out of  
mutual funds by enabling investors to evaluate and compare costs,'' 
Levitt said at a news conference. ``And it lets investors see how 
costs add up in dollars and cents over time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mutual fund cost calculator will allow investors to examine  
the costs of funds and compare different funds, much like unit 
pricing helps shoppers compare prices of different sizes of cereal 
boxes on supermarket shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	The calculator is available on the SEC's Web site at www.sec.gov  
and through the Web site of the Investment Company Institute, the 
mutual fund industry's trade group, at www.ici.org. 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt said he hoped the new program ``will spur the fund  
industry ... to come up with better ways to explain fund costs to 
investors and better tools to help investors compare fund costs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Investment Company Institute called the calculator ``a  
valuable new resource to help investors understand how fees and 
expenses affect their investments and returns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some 77 million Americans now invest in mutual funds, whose  
total assets exceeded $5.5 trillion at the end of last year, up 
from around $1 trillion in 1990. The earnings are often counted on 
for retirement, meeting college bills or other major expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the SEC's research shows that less than half of mutual fund  
investors know that expenses are deducted on an ongoing basis. Only 
8 percent of the investors surveyed said they completely understand 
the fees charged by their funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Mutual fund prospectuses include tables showing the fees and  
expenses of each fund. But investors haven't been able to use the 
information effectively, the regulators say. 
</P>
<P>
	The new calculator is designed to answer questions such as: I  
plan to retire in 20 years. Am I better off buying a no-load fund 
with annual expenses of 1.5 percent or a fund with a front-end 
sales charge of 3.5 percent and annual expenses of 0.9 percent? And 
what if I decide to retire in 15 years rather than 20? 
</P>
<P>
	No-load funds do not charge sales commissions and keep other  
fees low, but they do charge some fees. 
</P>
<P>
	The calculator ``sounds like a Godsend for investors who are  
pulling their hair out trying to calculate all these costs,'' said 
Marc Beauchamp, spokesman for the North American Securities 
Administrators Association, which represents state securities 
regulators. ``They shouldn't need to know advanced math to figure 
out their mutual fund costs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC advised investors that fees are not the only factor they  
should consider when choosing a mutual fund. After reading the 
prospectus document and the fund's annual report, the agency said, 
investors also should assess: 
</P>
<P>
	--The number of years needed to reach an investment goal.  
</P>
<P>
	--The types of stocks, bonds or other securities that the fund  
buys. 
</P>
<P>
	--The investment risks of the fund.  
</P>
<P>
	--The fit between the fund and their other investments.  
</P>
<P>
	--The fund company or portfolio manager who runs the fund.  
</P>
<P>
	--The fund's performance record.  
</P>
<P>
	--The types of services offered by the fund company.

<HEADLINE> Tonight's Big Game Is Worth $190M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Lottery players have heard it before: A 747 is  
more likely to land on your head as aliens raid your fridge than 
the Big Game is to dump millions in your bank account. 
</P>
<P>
	``So what?'' is the common cash register rejoinder.  
</P>
<P>
	Lotteries are about daydreaming, not probability, and plenty of  
people were contemplating the $190 million Big Game jackpot to be 
drawn Tuesday night, despite the 76.3 million-to-1 odds against 
winning it. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has claimed the jackpot since Feb. 2, meaning that plenty  
of folks are dropping lots of cash for a chance. 
</P>
<P>
	Lottery officials in the six Big Game states -- Georgia,  
Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan and Virginia -- were to 
determine whether to increase the jackpot again, said Maryland 
Lottery Director Buddy Roogow. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in uncharted territory here so it's difficult for us to  
be absolutely certain of what the jackpot will be,'' said Rebecca 
Paul, president of the Georgia Lottery Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	In Georgia, the state that sells the most Big Game tickets,  
players forked over $317,391 from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. Monday, more 
than double the $120,695 spent in the same period a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	In the seven days ending at midnight Saturday, the Georgia  
Lottery saw its best sales week -- $72 million, $20 million more 
than the previous record in June 1993, the lottery's first week. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland retailers were zipping through 45 lottery transactions  
per second at one point Monday morning, with an average sale of 
$2.50, Roogow said. 
</P>
<P>
	None of this entertainment-by-numbers impresses mathematicians,  
who say that most people don't really understand the enormity of 
lottery odds and probably wouldn't play if they did. 
</P>
<P>
	``People seem to be oblivious to obvious risk,'' grumbles John  
Allen Paulos, a prominent Temple University mathematics professor 
and author of five books that examine numbers from a lay person's 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
	Non-gamblers like Paulos have honed the litany of all the bad  
stuff more likely to befall you than lottery millions, such as 
lightning strikes, heart attacks, plane crashes, meteorites and 
falling trees. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have a better chance of going to the moon'' than winning,  
said Tyler Jarvis, an assistant math professor at Brigham Young 
University who was provoked to write ``Gambling: What are the 
Odds?'' two years ago at Mississippi State when his undergraduate 
math students became enamored of casino gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	``By any normal human standards, the odds are zero,'' Jarvis  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Janusz Mrozek, an assistant economics professor at Georgia Tech,  
said he ``invests'' $5 to $10 in the Big Game if the cash payout -- 
about $100 million for today's drawing -- equals the odds of 
winning. 
</P>
<P>
	But like all the other academics, Mrozek said the huge odds  
render his practical chances of winning zero. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really like to play, in a sense, unless the payout is  
in some psychologic sense comparable to the odds,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But huge jackpots have their own special lure, Mrozek said, and  
Paulos conceded that spending a buck in the lottery might provide a 
``dollar of anticipation'' if nothing else.

<HEADLINE> Dow Closes at New High: 10,085.31 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average soared in the  
last hour of trading today and hit a new record high as investors, 
nervous about upcoming earnings reports, sought the relative safety 
of blue-chip stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was up 121.82 at 10,085.31. It was the Dow's third close 
above 10,000, and eclipsed the previous high close of 10,007.33, 
reached Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed, reflecting the fact that  
investors are for the time being turning away from unpredictable 
technology stocks and moving their money to blue-chips that are 
seen as surer bets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite index, heavily weighted in technology  
issues, fell 18.81 to 2,544.36, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index 
rose 8.86 to 1,326.75. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks opened strongly as aluminum maker Alcoa released  
first-quarter earnings that soundly beat analysts' expectations. 
The good news from Alcoa, a component of the Dow, helped many 
blue-chips move higher. Alcoa itself was up 2 13/16 to 43 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T, another Dow stock, was up 4 13/16 at 84 15/16.  
</P>
<P>
	The financial sector was mostly higher as analysts said banks  
and brokerages have hinted they will report strong earnings when 
they begin releasing first-quarter results next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Ned Riley, chief investment officer at BankBoston, said  
investors may be rewarding those companies for weathering the 
global financial crises of 1998. The financial companies are also 
benefiting from stable interest rates, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chase Manhattan rose 5 1/8 to 84 3/8, and Merrill Lynch rose 5 1/8 to  
96 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong sales report from Ford Motor sent its shares up 2 1/2 to  
60 3/4. The automaker said in its report Tuesday it plans to increase 
production in the coming months. The news enticed investors with 
hints of future strength. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip stocks easily outperformed technology stocks  
today. Computer companies held the market in check for much the 
afternoon after Merrill Lynch analysts warned of some tough times 
ahead for the high-tech sector. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem, according to William Meehan, chief market analyst  
at Cantor Fitzgerald, is that stocks are too overvalued to 
withstand even the slightest hint of caution. ``It doesn't take 
much to trigger any kind of stampede,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Software maker Novell slipped 1 1/8 to 22 15/16, and Sun  
Microsystems fell 1 7/8 to 138 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, traders were optimistically looking ahead to an  
after-hours earnings release from Yahoo!, which was expected to 
beat analyst estimates -- and did so, by three cents a share. Yahoo! 
ended lower in profit-taking after rising more than 16 points 
earlier in the day.

<HEADLINE> China Telecom Dismembered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China announced the breakup Wednesday of the  
government's telecommunications monopoly into four specialized 
companies, a move that comes as U.S. and Chinese negotiators hold 
down-to-the-wire talks on China's bid to join the World Trade 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The long-awaited decision on the dismemberment of China Telecom  
would potentially open up a $28 billion market to foreign 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	China Telecom's tight grip on 95 percent of that market has been  
a major stumbling block in the WTO negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Before setting out on his current U.S. visit, Premier Zhu Rongji  
reportedly said China would allow foreigners to take up to 30 
percent stakes in telecommunications companies. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. negotiators trying to wrest concessions from China for an  
agreement on WTO membership during Zhu's visit want 50 percent 
foreign equity in telecommunications ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	China Telecom's vast operations will be divided into a  
traditional phone company, a mobile communications company, a 
paging company and a satellite communications company, the Ministry 
of Information Industry said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The breaking up of China Telecom is aimed at smashing the  
telecommunications monopoly in China and introducing competition to 
set up a fair and orderly market,'' Minister of Information 
Industry Wu Jichuan said in the statement, carried by the state-run 
Xinhua News Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	But industry analysts have questioned how much competition will  
be created by splitting one giant monopoly into what many see as 
four specialized monopolies. 
</P>
<P>
	A previous attempt to create a competitor to China Telecom has  
largely failed. China Unicom holds the other five percent of the 
Chinese telecommunications market, but has just $15.7 million in 
assets compared with China Telecom's $68 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	But since Chinese leaders consider information technology a  
crucial field for future prosperity and economic power, they have 
shown an interest in propping up China Unicom and welcoming more 
foreign investment in the sector. 
</P>
<P>
	The Xinhua report gave no time frame for the China Telecom  
break-up. Wu said new regulations for the telecommunications sector 
would be put in place in the first half of the year.

<HEADLINE> Hate Crimes Bill Fate Uncertain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation that would broaden the federal  
hate crimes law by including offenses based on sexual orientation 
faces an uncertain future despite President Clinton's call for 
lawmakers to pass it this year. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar bill, which Clinton also pushed, died in the last  
Congress. Neither the House nor the Senate or any of the 
appropriate committees voted on it. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House and other supporters hope public outrage over  
recent well-publicized hate crimes will help advance the measure 
this time around. 
</P>
<P>
	But opposition, however, appears so strong that a lead sponsor,  
Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., doubts whether Congress will approve it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to face the reality that it's a very tough sell,''  
Specter, a former local prosecutor, said in an interview Wednesday. 
``After a while you can develop a majority (of votes) but I think 
we're a long way from it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Judiciary Committee hearings are expected later this  
month. 
</P>
<P>
	At a White House ceremony Tuesday, Clinton said Congress should  
pass the bill this year and ``send a message to ourselves and to 
the world that we are going into 21st century determined to preach 
and to practice what is right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hate Crimes Prevention Act would add disability, gender and  
sexual orientation to federal anti-bias laws and make it easier for 
the Justice Department to investigate and prosecute such offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Current law prohibits crimes based on race, color, religion or  
national origin. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight state have no hate crimes laws. Laws in 21 states cover  
sexual orientation, 22 state laws include gender and 21 cover 
disability. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Socarides, Clinton's civil rights adviser, said the  
White House was more optimistic this time because of public 
sentiment over the killings and the upcoming Senate hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	``The signs are better than ever before,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	David Smith, spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign, a gay and  
lesbian political advocacy group, cited a Gallup poll, conducted in 
mid-February, that found that 70 percent of the public favors 
having a hate crimes law in their state. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would be very happy for there to be no need for this  
legislation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some opponents believe federal intervention is unnecessary,  
because states already are prosecuting allegations of hate crimes, 
and discriminatory. Social conservatives, meanwhile, view the bill 
as creating special protections for gays. 
</P>
<P>
	``By including hate crimes enhancement for some groups, the  
message is that the government cares more about those victims than 
other people,'' said Robert H. Knight, senior director for cultural 
studies at the conservative Family Research council. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the recent hate-crime cases:  
</P>
<P>
	-- In Texas, white supremacist John William King was sentenced to  
death in February for dragging James Byrd Jr., who was black, to 
his death behind a pickup truck in June 1998. Two other men await 
trial in the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
	-- In Wyoming, Russell Henderson, one of two young men charged in  
the beating death of Matthew Shepard, a gay college student, 
pleaded guilty Monday to murder and was sentenced to two 
consecutive life terms in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	-- In Alabama, two men face murder charges in the Feb. 19 killing  
of Billy Jack Gaither, who was gay. Police say he was beaten with 
an ax handle and burned to death because he allegedly made a pass 
at one of the men.

<HEADLINE> Merck Pushes New Cholesterol Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- What's worse: Letting millions of Americans go  
untreated for high cholesterol or allowing consumers to buy a 
potent cholesterol-lowering drug without a doctor's guidance? 
</P>
<P>
	That's the public health dilemma posed by Merck Co.'s  
proposition to sell its cholesterol drug Mevacor without a 
prescription. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal regulators will closely scrutinize the company's plan  
because Mevacor, in its prescription strength, carries a small 
chance of liver damage. That side effect requires that users of the 
drug in its prescription strength have blood tests when they first 
start taking it to check for problems. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the Food and Drug Administration rejected the concept  
of over-the-counter cholesterol drugs, a ruling that still remains 
in place. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck wouldn't disclose details of its plans except to say  
research is under way. It hasn't yet applied to the Food and Drug 
Administration and the agency could order additional research that 
would delay the move for months or years. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts said the company's main challenge will be to come up  
with a dosage that would be effective, with no need for followup 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``This would be wonderful for the public,'' said Charlie  
Inlander, president of the People's Medical Society, a consumer 
health group based in Allentown, Pa. ``As long as its safe and 
effective, why shouldn't we have it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Merck's plan gets approval, it could fill a significant  
public health need. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts estimate that only one-third of the 13 million Americans  
with symptoms of heart disease are taking cholesterol drugs. An 
additional 16 million with high cholesterol, but no symptoms of 
heart disease, are untreated. 
</P>
<P>
	Views of doctors vary.  
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Rodman Starke, executive vice president of the American  
Heart Association, said cholesterol drugs should always be taken 
under a doctor's care. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Bernard Gersh, a consultant in cardiovascular diseases at  
the Mayo Clinic, said the idea has merit, and he noted that Mevacor 
has been around for more than a decade and is safe with the vast 
majority of patients. ``Mevacor is as safe a drug as aspirin,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Basil Rifkind, senior scientific advisor to the National  
Heart Lung and Blood Institute said the need to get more people on 
cholesterol drugs would call for at least testing the drug in a 
non-prescription form. 
</P>
<P>
	An over-the-counter version of Mevacor would likely increase  
usage because patients would not have to visit a doctor and because 
its price would drop. A monthly supply of Mevacor now costs about 
$150. 
</P>
<P>
	Moving the drug to non-prescription status would disqualify it  
from insurance coverage. But consumer advocates note most seniors, 
who are the biggest users of Mevacor, already lack coverage for 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck has good business reasons for its move.  
</P>
<P>
	Mevacor loses its 20 years of patent protection in June 2002,  
making it susceptible to competition from cheaper generics. 
</P>
<P>
	Some securities analysts say Merck's plan is a long shot.  
</P>
<P>
	``The FDA is never going to approve an OTC product that relies  
on a patient's own volition to get liver tests,'' said Alex Zisson, 
with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA in 1997 decided cholesterol drugs should not be sold  
over the counter because patients need to first be diagnosed with 
high cholesterol. An FDA spokeswoman said the agency still 
maintains the same position. 
</P>
<P>
	Mevacor, approved in 1987, was the first of a powerful new class  
of cholesterol-lowering medicines known as statins. 
</P>
<P>
	As late as 1995 Mevacor was the world's best-selling cholesterol  
drug. But since then it has lost its profit punch as newer drugs 
have proven more potent. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Mevacor had global sales of $745 million, down 32  
percent from 1997. It's now the fourth most widely sold cholesterol 
drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers can already buy a low-dosage form of Mevacor's active  
ingredient in an herbal product called Cholestin. 
</P>
<P>
	Cholestin is made from red yeast that has been fermented on rice  
and contains a small amount of that ingredient, called lovastatin.

<HEADLINE> S&AMP;L Figure Sued by Mother </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A former savings and loan president who served  
nearly eight years in prison for stealing millions from the thrift 
before it collapsed is in trouble again -- this time accused of 
fraud by his 87-year-old mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland authorities have begun an investigation into Nettie  
Levitt-Gilbert's claims, filed in a Florida court, that her son, 
Jeffrey A. Levitt, used her credit cards to bamboozle her in a 
stock scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	If Mrs. Levitt-Gilbert's claims are true, they could constitute  
a violation of her son's parole. 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt was released from prison in 1993 after serving almost  
eight years of a 30-year sentence for embezzling $14.6 million from 
his thrift, Old Court Savings &AMP; Loan. Old Court collapsed in May 
1985, touching off a crisis in the then-privately insured Maryland 
thrift industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's convicted of credit card fraud, there is a possibility  
of his return to Maryland to finish his sentence,'' said Leonard A. 
Sipes Jr. of the state Division of Correction. 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt, 56, who now works as a cigar salesman in Boynton Beach,  
Fla., denied his mother's allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I swear to God I didn't do anything illegal,'' he said in  
today's editions of The (Baltimore) Sun. ``I wouldn't steal a 
nickel from my mother.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His attorney, Jonathan Bloom, called the allegations ridiculous.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a stupid lawsuit, and we're going to win,'' Bloom said.  
``The case is in my joke file.''

<HEADLINE>  Hero Sailor Poised To Win Solo Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Giovanni Soldini already is a hero. Now he can become a  
champion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian sailor has a 10-day lead heading into the fourth and  
final leg of the Around Alone yacht race, a 27,000-mile, nine-month 
odyssey that takes solo sailors through some of the world's most 
treacherous seas. 
</P>
<P>
	With that kind of cushion, he could sail backward for several  
days and still win. Still, he knows that Atlantic winds are fickle 
-- and remembers his embarrassment there on the first leg, where one 
tactical mistake left him too close to the ocean calms and 500 
miles behind his competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine sailors -- down from an original fleet of 16 -- will take off  
April 10 from Punta del Este, Uruguay, heading through the tropics 
to Charleston, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	More than the scenery changes: Sailors have spent the last few  
weeks stripping their boats of heavy weather gear as the course 
shifts from a roller-coaster survival run into a tricky, tactical 
upwind dance along the South American coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The race itself was wide open until the third leg, when the  
sailors left Auckland, New Zealand, on Feb. 5 to traverse the 
unpredictable waters around Cape Horn. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the carnage began. Within days, Josh Hall of Britain lost  
his mast and was out of the race; Isabelle Autissier, a heavy 
favorite to win, flipped and could not right her 60-foot yacht, 
PRB; Marc Thiercelin, a fellow French native who was her main 
rival, saw his 80-foot mast crumple and smash a large hole in his 
deck. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was lucky that my head was not cut off,'' Thiercelin said at  
the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Into it all rode Soldini, barreling through 30-foot seas to find  
Autissier's upside-down boat 22 hours later in a Pacific region so 
remote that national rescue agencies would not venture into it. 
Taking only her passport, Autissier opened her boat's final hatch 
and sent her million-dollar racing machine to the ocean floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I am here today, if I am able to speak to you, to laugh or  
cry or whatever, it is because Giovanni came,'' she told the 
hundreds who greeted her and Soldini when they arrived March 3 in 
Punta del Este. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, I am sad about my boat, but to be alive is  
better,'' she added. 
</P>
<P>
	Autissier, one of the finest single-handed sailors, gave up her  
decade-long quest to win the race and announced her retirement. 
Soldini earned a medal of heroism from Italy -- and the deep 
admiration of thousands following the race on its Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Thiercelin made a makeshift mast, saw his lead evaporate into a  
huge deficit and was vilified in cyberspace for not coming to 
Autissier's aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldini and Thiercelin are all that's left of Class I, for boats  
up to 60 feet. In Class II, for boats up to 50 feet, Jean-Pierre 
Mouligne of France has a nearly an eight-day lead and is the 
favorite to win. 
</P>
<P>
	But the racing spirit has not been lost -- a fight for second has  
emerged between 54-year-old Mike Garside of Britain and Brad Van 
Liew, 31, of Santa Monica, Calif., the youngest sailor and only 
American left. 
</P>
<P>
	After 35 strenuous days on the second leg, the two Class II  
racers arrived in Auckland within 2 1/2 minutes of each other -- the 
closest finish in race history. Garside has a 9 1/2-hour lead over Van 
Liew going into the fourth leg. 
</P>
<P>
	``This race-within-a-race has definitely increased the stress  
level,'' Van Liew said from Punta del Este, where he was 
overhauling his boat and trying to gain back some of the 30 pounds 
he had lost on the third leg. ``The next leg, all the gloves are 
off.''

<HEADLINE>  Hero Sailor Poised To Win Solo Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Giovanni Soldini already is a hero. Now he can become a  
champion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian sailor has a 10-day lead heading into the fourth and  
final leg of the Around Alone yacht race, a 27,000-mile, nine-month 
odyssey that takes solo sailors through some of the world's most 
treacherous seas. 
</P>
<P>
	With that kind of cushion, he could sail backward for several  
days and still win. Still, he knows that Atlantic winds are fickle 
-- and remembers his embarrassment there on the first leg, where one 
tactical mistake left him too close to the ocean calms and 500 
miles behind his competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine sailors -- down from an original fleet of 16 -- will take off  
April 10 from Punta del Este, Uruguay, heading through the tropics 
to Charleston, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	More than the scenery changes: Sailors have spent the last few  
weeks stripping their boats of heavy weather gear as the course 
shifts from a roller-coaster survival run into a tricky, tactical 
upwind dance along the South American coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The race itself was wide open until the third leg, when the  
sailors left Auckland, New Zealand, on Feb. 5 to traverse the 
unpredictable waters around Cape Horn. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the carnage began. Within days, Josh Hall of Britain lost  
his mast and was out of the race; Isabelle Autissier, a heavy 
favorite to win, flipped and could not right her 60-foot yacht, 
PRB; Marc Thiercelin, a fellow French native who was her main 
rival, saw his 80-foot mast crumple and smash a large hole in his 
deck. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was lucky that my head was not cut off,'' Thiercelin said at  
the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Into it all rode Soldini, barreling through 30-foot seas to find  
Autissier's upside-down boat 22 hours later in a Pacific region so 
remote that national rescue agencies would not venture into it. 
Taking only her passport, Autissier opened her boat's final hatch

<HEADLINE> Staples Opens 15 24-hour Chains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- In this global economy, business doesn't sleep.  
</P>
<P>
	Seeking to capitalize on that notion, Staples is opening 15 of  
its office-supply stores around the clock. 
</P>
<P>
	The move puts Staples into direct competition with 24-hour  
chains such as Kinko's, which are popular among business travelers 
and students needing photocopies, laser printouts, or access to a 
computer and the Internet at any time day or night. 
</P>
<P>
	But Staples also hopes to draw customers who need three-ring  
binders and fancy highlighting for projects due the next morning as 
well as those who don't have time to shop during the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``With today's hectic pace, sometimes the only opportunity to  
shop for office supplies is in the off hours,'' Staples president 
Jim Peters said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15 all-night stores are opening in areas near colleges or in  
dense urban communities in nine states: California, Indiana, 
Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, 
Pennsylvania and Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Staples executives said there were no immediate plans to extend  
the 24-hour openings across the 950-store chain. 
</P>
<P>
	Four stores -- two in the Boston area, one in West Los Angeles  
and one in Springfield, Penn. -- were tested with the 24-hour 
concept before the chain broadened to 15 stores, said Christina 
Erridge, a store spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	Most stores in the chain now open at 7 a.m. and close at 9 p.m.  
or 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Staples, based in Westboro, Mass., is believed to be the first  
among the office superstores to open all night, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Karen Sack, an analyst with the S&AMP;P Equity Group in New York,  
said the hour expansion made sense but may not necessarily add to 
the bottom line. ``I wouldn't raise earnings estimates based on the 
fact that they're going to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When other industries such as supermarkets began opening all  
night, competitors quickly followed. The same is likely to happen 
with Staples, Sack said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once one starts, then almost everybody has to do it at some  
point because it's the name that remains in the consumer's mind and 
attracts people -- whether they're there at midnight or not,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15 all-night Staples stores are located in: Alhambra,  
Calif.; Studio City, Calif.; West Los Angeles, Calif.; Bloomington, 
Ind.; Boston's Brighton neighborhood; Danvers, Mass.; Framingham, 
Mass.; Tysons Corner, Va.; East Lansing, Mich.; Fayetteville, N.C.; 
New York, N.Y.; Yonkers, N.Y.; Springfield, N.J.; Springfield, 
Penn.; Bryn Mawr, Penn.

<HEADLINE> NTSB Urges Child Safety in Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cars should be designed with child safety  
first in mind, especially in the back seat where most children 
ride, the head of a federal safety agency says. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board,  
is taking that message to automakers in New York for the annual 
auto show there. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite overwhelming statistics indicating the need for better  
protection for children, child passenger safety has been an 
afterthought when it comes to designing cars. That needs to 
change,'' Hall said in remarks prepared for delivery Thursday at 
the World Traffic Safety Symposium, an event being held in 
conjunction with the New York International Auto Show. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time to put children and their safety first in vehicle  
design,'' Hall said. ``We need look no further than the 
first-generation air bag to understand the consequences of not 
doing so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Air bags inflating in minor crashes have been blamed for killing  
131 people, including 73 children. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said crash tests that automakers must pass for federal  
safety compliance should include child dummies in the back seats to 
learn how well the vehicles protect them from head and neck 
injuries. The back seat is now empty in those crash tests. 
</P>
<P>
	When children are in the car, they ride in the back seat about  
70 percent of the time, according to the agency's analysis of 
federal crash data from 1996 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Traffic crashes are the leading cause of death for children  
older than age 5. This decade, more than 60,000 children, infants 
to teen-agers, have died in traffic crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said the Safety Board is urging automakers to:  
</P>
<P>
	--Install shoulder belts in all rear seating positions in cars  
and light trucks, including the rear center seat where they are 
often missing. 
</P>
<P>
	--Make the shoulder belts in rear seats adjustable so that they  
can be lowered in height to properly fit across children's chests 
rather than rise up at their necks. Most autos have adjustable 
shoulder belts only in the front seats. 
</P>
<P>
	--Stock more vehicles with built-in child seats.  
</P>
<P>
	In a speech in January, Hall announced the safety board was  
recommending a nationwide network of fitting stations to check that 
child seats are properly installed to protect children in auto 
crashes. Government statistics indicate more than 80 percent of 
child seats are installed incorrectly.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Exchange Index Climbs / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's benchmark stock index climbed to its  
highest level in nearly nine months today, spurred by continued 
buying by foreign investors. The U.S. dollar fell against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.78 yen at late afternoon, down 0.28 yen  
from late Tuesday in Tokyo but above its late New York level of 
120.62 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 74.79 points, or 0.45  
percent, closing at 16,554.50 points, its highest close since July 
21, when the average closed at 16,556.69. The average has now 
gained for the third straight day, fetching 264.31 points in three 
days, including Tuesday's 144.93-point gain, or 0.89 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei average moved into positive territory toward the  
closing bell with gains in high technology issues, including Sony 
and Toshiba. 
</P>
<P>
	Miyoshi Okano, manager of the equity department with Cosmo  
Securities, said continued buying by U.S. investment funds led the 
way as they considered Japanese stocks still priced relatively low, 
compared to their U.S. and European counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 709  
million shares, up from Tuesday's 568 million shares. Advancers 
outnumbered declines 762 to 466, with 98 issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 2.03 points, or 0.15 percent, to 1,324.64. The 
TOPIX closed up 15.44 points, or 1.18 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar slipped against the yen after  
the euro strengthened as Yugoslavia announced a unilateral 
cease-fire in its battle against Kosovo rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslav action was rejected by Western leaders, who said  
the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia would continue. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar, often regarded as a haven in times of international  
unrest, had been rising against the euro since the bombing began on 
March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	In today's trading, the dollar ranged between 120.43 yen and  
121.20 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo trading, the euro bought $1.0775, up from its late  
Tuesday rate in Tokyo of $1.0715. The euro also bought 130.20 yen, 
up from 130.19 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 211 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.675 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.795 percent, 
driving its price up to 101.08 yen from 100.04 yen.

<HEADLINE> D.C. Gallery Gets Sculpture Garden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's designed to be a quiet, shady place where  
tourists can relax and enjoy art. But visitors to the new sculpture 
garden of the National Gallery of Art may find the only vacant 
bench next to a 24-foot spider. 
</P>
<P>
	Not to worry, says the gallery: The spider is a ``looming and  
powerful protectress, who is also nurturing and vulnerable.'' The 
spider is cast in bronze, the work of 87-year-old French-American 
sculptor Louise Bourgeois. 
</P>
<P>
	The new tree-shaded garden -- a dream 33 years in the making -- is  
due to open May 23, joining the string of parks, museums and 
memorials along the big, grassy Mall in the center of the nation's 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
	The new sculpture garden sits just across a street from the  
gallery's old West Building, directly across the Mall from the 
sculpture garden of the Hirshhorn Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hirshhorn specializes in modern art but has more familiar  
statues of human forms in its sculpture garden, while the National 
Gallery's garden has opted for some more-recent and astonishing 
pieces. 
</P>
<P>
	The new 6.1-acre space was reserved for a garden long ago, but  
continually hit snags along the way. Flowered walks with ample 
benches have been laid out by Philadelphia landscape artist Laurie 
Olin around a circular pool. There are 314 new shrubs and trees, 
some 35 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
	In winter, the pool will continue to be an ice-skating rink. A  
new, upgraded cafe and restaurant will have tables both indoors and 
outdoors beginning this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The skating rink was put in first, but then someone thought it  
wasn't dignified to combine art with a skating rink, and we 
couldn't get money from Congress to do the garden,'' said J. Carter 
Brown, chairman of Washington's Fine Arts Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the director of the National Gallery, Earl A. Powell III,  
has received permission from the Morris and Gwendolyn Cafritz 
Foundation to use $10 million from its grants to develop the 
garden. The foundation is also buying seven of the 10 new 
sculptures that will stand with nearly a dozen others from the 
gallery's collection among the trees, shrubs and flowers. 
</P>
<P>
	Upkeep will be covered by the gallery's regular appropriation  
from Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown predicted that a shaded, comfortable space will attract  
sun-weary tourists in summer and tired skaters in winter, 
introducing them to a kind of art they may never have seen. 
</P>
<P>
	Less ominous than the spider but almost as big will be a  
brand-new statue, a 19-foot ``Typewriter Eraser, Class X.'' It's by 
Claes Oldenburg, a Swedish-born American who thinks big, and his 
wife, Cooje van Bruggen, an American born in the Netherlands. In 
the days before computers, typists used an eraser a few inches long 
to correct errors. The Oldenburgs are known for gigantic figures of 
ordinary objects, such as lipsticks and hamburgers. 
</P>
<P>
	More conventional and poignant will be 30 3-foot bronzes called  
``Puellae'' (Girls) by Polish artist Magdalena Abakanowicz. They 
refer to a story she heard from World War II, about a group of 
children found frozen to death in cattle cars as they were being 
brought to Germany from Poland. 
</P>
<P>
	The gallery's indoor collection will contribute a red horse made  
of painted sheet metal by American engineer-sculptor Alexander 
Calder, who invented the mobile.

<HEADLINE> Lawsuit Claims MCI Discriminates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- MCI WorldCom Inc. discriminates by preventing  
customers from making international calls from predominantly 
minority neighborhoods designated as ``high fraud'' areas, 
according to a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is redlining at its worst,'' said Raymond Boucher, who  
filed the lawsuit in Superior Court on Tuesday on behalf of Darren 
Haylock. 
</P>
<P>
	Haylock attempted to make a calling card call last week from his  
mother's home in South Central Los Angeles to relatives in Belize 
after a family member died. MCI refused to let the call go through 
even after he provided his mother's maiden name and his Social 
Security number for identification, the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The operator confirmed the information but told Haylock that  
South Central, a Los Angeles neighborhood with mostly black and 
Hispanic residents, was considered a ``high fraud'' area and 
blocked the call. Haylock eventually went to his home in the San 
Fernando Valley and was able to make the call, said co-counsel Paul 
Kiesel. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit accuses MCI of discrimination, deceptive practices,  
false advertising, unfair competition and unfair trade practices. 
It seeks a court order that would prohibit MCI from such practices. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for MCI WorldCom, the nation's second-largest  
long-distance phone company, said he had not seen the lawsuit and 
could not comment.

<HEADLINE>  Chinese Premier Begins U.S. Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Anticipating his trip would be diplomatically  
sticky, Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji sought pointers from the U.S. 
ambassador to China before leaving on his tour of the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he got this advice from Ambassador James R. Sasser: ``In  
such an adverse situation `always keep a smiling face.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu, the first Chinese premier to visit the United States in 15  
years, appeared to be heeding that suggestion on the first day of 
his nine-day, six-city tour, mixing humor with serious issues in 
speeches in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	In a reference to recent allegations that China spied on the  
United States and stole nuclear weapons technology, he offered this 
warning to anyone visiting his country: ``Please remember when you 
return to China, don't bring any materials so you can avoid being 
investigated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that he had been asked how the 50th anniversary of the  
People's Republic of China would be celebrated, Zhu also said that 
his country might consider parading its military equipment with 
signs saying ``Made in China and Developed with Chinese 
Technology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a banquet Tuesday night, Zhu assured the mostly  
Chinese-American audience that the trade deficit, human rights 
violations and other controversial issues won't strain U.S.-China 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the questions and problems between China and the United  
States ... are no more than an episode in the longer history of the 
friendly relations and the cooperation between China and the United 
States,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, his arrival was met with vocal  
demonstrations by 50 people advocating a free Tibet and an 
independent Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters waved banners and chanted ``Free Tibet before free  
trade'' in the rain outside the Century Plaza Hotel, where Zhu 
addressed a luncheon hosted by Mayor Richard Riordan.

<HEADLINE>  Chinese Premier Begins U.S. Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Anticipating his trip would be diplomatically  
sticky, Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji sought pointers from the U.S. 
ambassador to China before leaving on his tour of the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he got this advice from Ambassador James R. Sasser: ``In  
such an adverse situation `always keep a smiling face.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu, the first Chinese premier to visit the United States in 15  
years, appeared to be heeding that suggestion on the first day of 
his nine-day, six-city tour, mixing humor with serious issues in 
speeches in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	In a reference to recent allegations that China spied on the  
United States and stole nuclear weapons technology, he offered this 
warning to anyone visiting his country: ``Please remember when you 
return to China, don't bring any materials so you can avoid being 
investigated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that he had been asked how the 50th anniversary of the  
People's Republic of China would be celebrated, Zhu also said that 
his country might consider parading its military equipment with 
signs saying ``Made in China and Developed with Chinese 
Technology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a banquet Tuesday night, Zhu assured the mostly  
Chinese-American audience that the trade deficit, human rights 
violations and other controversial issues won't strain U.S.-China 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the questions and problems between China and the United  
States ... are no more than an episode in the longer history of the 
friendly relations and the cooperation between China and the United 
States,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, his arrival was met with vocal  
demonstrations by 50 people advocating a free Tibet and an 
independent Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters waved banners and chanted ``Free Tibet before free  
trade'' in the rain outside the Century Plaza Hotel, where Zhu 
addressed a luncheon hosted by Mayor Richard Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
	The 70-year-old premier, speaking through a translator, said  
California Gov. Gray Davis raised the issue of human rights, but 
that they did not have time for adequate discussion. Davis' office 
said they met for 25 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu also said the United States and China reached a key  
agreement on agricultural trade, but U.S. Special Trade 
Representative Peter Scher in Washington said no deal had been 
reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu said China agreed to lift bans on citrus from four U.S.  
states and wheat from seven states, a deal that could boost China's 
effort to gain U.S. support for membership in the World Trade 
Organization.

<HEADLINE> The Online Trainer to the Stars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- He's known in Hollywood as the  
X-man, fitness guru to the stars. 
</P>
<P>
	He's buff and tan, but no bodybuilder.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm more of an athlete. I'm not like a steroided-out muscle  
boy, not that there's anything wrong with bodybuilding,'' said 
Xavier Carrica, who runs a Web site for hard-body celebrities too 
busy to drive to the gym, as well as roly-poly show business 
executives too shy to pump iron in public. 
</P>
<P>
	They log on to the Internet for fitness help.  
</P>
<P>
	And sometimes, a scolding.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pretty direct with people,'' said Carrica, who has helped  
Salma Hayek, Bronson Pinchot and others get lean. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, he dispenses much of his ``no pain, no gain'' mantra  
from a computer terminal in his West Hollywood home. 
</P>
<P>
	But he still does one-on-one personal training sessions with  
celebrities like Elizabeth Taylor, Kevin Spacey and Cheryl Tiegs. 
Prices start at $125 for a one-hour session. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrica, 37, recently helped actress Paula Cale of NBC-TV's  
``Providence'' slim down. ``I took her from being pregnant to 
getting svelte,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Personal training sessions take place in home gyms or in a local  
gym or beach club. ``This is Hollywood. It's no big deal here,'' 
Carrica said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrica is one of the many personal trainers who keep  
celebrities in shape and often take on the role of friend, 
bodyguard or confidante. 
</P>
<P>
	``The majority of time I feel like a therapist,'' he laughed.  
</P>
<P>
	When Carrica opened his virtual gym concept 18 months ago, he  
charged $30 a month for personalized diet and workout advice by 
e-mail. He quickly had 100 clients. His Web site now offers an 
annual $50 membership. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just kept expanding, so to accommodate everybody, I got  
sponsors and opened it up to anyone who wants to look at the 
workout and meal plans or specific exercises,'' Carrica said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm now over 1,000 members, and there was no way for me to  
work with them individually. It works out better,'' he explained. 
``They pick and choose the various meal plans and exercises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site's mission is to help people who hate going to the  
gym but need some sort of personal interaction to work out at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's partly because they are shy, partly because they don't  
want to spend the money to go to the gym or hire a personal 
trainer,'' Carrica said. ``I took the tricks of the trade and 
posted it on a site, and people come to learn from someone they 
trust. Some people just want to fine-tune from the comfort of their 
homes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 10 percent to 15 percent need special attention.  
</P>
<P>
	``These people usually are really overweight and shy. This is  
something simple for them. I don't promise a lot, but I make myself 
available for motivation,'' the X-Man said. ``They e-mail me 
constantly. I guarantee a reply within 24 hours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He still hears a litany of excuses.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have people who come back and say it's not working. I e-mail  
them and ask what they did in the past week and tell them what the 
problem is,'' he said. ``I can be pretty direct with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His Web site allows surfers to download video demonstrations of  
Carrica doing the exercises he prescribes. There are also links to 
companies that sell fitness products. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrica's dreams, though, are awaiting advances in technology.  
Video streaming is still too slow, but faster modems on the horizon 
mean he could soon be hosting his own live virtual gym Internet 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I eventually want to do is turn it into a program, like a  
television program. 'X-Time' sounds good, doesn't it? I could put a 
pretty cool show together that is celebrity-driven,'' he said. ``I 
want to do something fun, informative and entertaining.''

<HEADLINE> Books and Authors: Ernest Shackleton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- When explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton and his  
crew returned to England after spending nearly two years stranded 
on the Antarctic seas, there was little fanfare. 
</P>
<P>
	It was 1917, and Shackleton and his crew had failed to do what  
they set out to do -- cross the Antarctic continent on foot. World 
War I had broken out the week Shackleton left England, and people 
were too busy mourning their dead to care about his story of 
enduring hardship. There were no heroes other than war heroes. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, eight decades later, writer Caroline Alexander tells  
Shackleton's story in ``The Endurance,'' a book named after his 
ship, using diaries and interviews with family members to tell the 
tale of the 28 men who spent 20 months on an ice floe and were 
stuck on a barren island, their trans-Antartica hike doomed. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander also is curator of an exhibit on the ordeal at the  
American Museum of Natural History in New York City beginning April 
10, and is working on a documentary film for NOVA and Boston's 
WGBH-TV. 
</P>
<P>
	Shackleton's expedition began in 1914. He saw his trip as the  
last great polar exploration because other men already had reached 
both poles. He named his ship Endurance after his family motto, 
``By endurance we conquer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ship and crew were supposed to drop off a shore party of  
officers and scientists and return after the winter to pick them up 
on the other side of Antarctica. Instead, the Endurance became an 
icebound home to all 28 men, 69 sled dogs and the ship's mascot, a 
cat they called Mrs. Chippy. 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 24, 1915, only a day's journey from its destination, the  
ship became stuck in ice. It was too far from civilization to 
establish radio contact, even with remote whaling stations in the 
South Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander tells how the men made the best of it by building new  
living quarters in the warm parts of the ship and sharing the shore 
party's provisions. They used melted ice for tea, cocoa and 
washing. They walked and exercised the dogs on the thick ice, which 
gradually moved the ship hundreds of miles away from its 
destination. They entertained themselves with songs and skits and 
by playing with the dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	The men survived for almost a year as the ever-shifting ice pack  
slowly crushed the ship's hull, and with it, hopes for the 
expedition. 
</P>
<P>
	The groaning ice began to tighten around the hull in April,  
making it vibrate. In midwinter the plates of ice grinding together 
sounded like distant artillery. The pressure piled huge blocks of 
ice on top of one another. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of July, men stood watch at night in case the ship  
had to be abandoned quickly. Blizzards tossed the Endurance back 
and forth in its icy trap. The temperature fell to minus 24 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the ice gets, the ice keeps,'' Capt. Frank Worsely quoted  
Shackleton as saying to him. 
</P>
<P>
	In October, the temperature rose to nearly 30 degrees and the  
ship broke free of the ice. But after drifting only about 100 yards 
it became stuck again. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he discovered that the ice had wrenched the stern post and  
the ship was leaking. Men on board pumped for hours, while men on 
the ice dug trenches to ease the pressure. Then they heard rushing 
water and the gunlike popping of beams cracking. On Oct. 26, 
Shackleton ordered them to abandon ship. 
</P>
<P>
	The men planned to walk with lifeboats until they found open  
water to launch them, But made less than a mile a day in the minus 
15 degree cold. Finally, they backtracked and set up camp close to 
the ship. 
</P>
<P>
	On Nov. 21, as the temperatures rose, the crumpled hull of the  
Endurance went down, bow first. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a queer silence over the camp,'' one man wrote in  
his diary. ``As for me, there was an odd lump in my throat and I 
found it hard to swallow. We were now very lonely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The men had salvaged more than 3 tons of provisions. They drank  
tea and ate pieces of dough called ``bannocks'' with penguin and 
seal meat. They used the blubber and skin for fuel when their 
gasoline ran out. The hunted, told stories, kept diaries. 
</P>
<P>
	As the temperatures rose, the men finally found enough open  
water to launch their lifeboats. They sailed for more than 36 
sleepless hours, battling storms, cold, exhaustion, frostbite and 
madness. They landed on barren Elephant Island, home only to 
penguins. From there, Shackleton and a small crew sailed a lifeboat 
800 miles to a Norwegian whaling station in the South Atlantic. 
After months of searching for a suitable boat, a Chilean tugboat 
returned to rescue the rest of his men. 
</P>
<P>
	Shackleton telegraphed long stories of his journey to the Daily  
Chronicle in London. But with the war raging, the story was largely 
ignored. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were just not interested in self-imposed disasters when  
millions of young men in Europe were being destroyed in the 
trenches,'' Alexander explained in an interview from her farm on 
Squam Lake in New Hampshire. Moreover, Shackleton's voyage was 
overshadowed by explorer Robert Falcon Scott's race to the South 
Pole years earlier. Shackleton had worked for Scott on an earlier 
expedition and hated it, vowing never to work under him again. 
Scott and his party reached the pole, only to find that Norwegian 
Roald Amundsen had beaten them there. Scott and his men died of 
hunger on their return journey. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander uses stark photos taken by Australian photographer  
James Francis Hurley to tell the story of the Endurance. 
</P>
<P>
	The diaries on which she draws give readers a glimpse of the  
relationships among the men and with their animals, and their 
ingenuity in battling hunger, frostbite, disease and mental 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, 42, was born in Gainesville, Fla., to English  
parents. She has lived in the Netherlands, Africa, Italy, the West 
Indies and England, where she went to college. She has a doctorate 
in classics from Columbia University. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Endurance,'' her fourth book, was first written from the  
viewpoint of Mrs. Chippy, the cat. But when she came across 
photographer Hurley's spectacular pictures, she decided to start 
anew from the men's point of view. 
</P>
<P>
	She was especially struck by their strong affection for their  
animals, expressed in countless diary entries, photos and even 
sketches. Once home, the men told of being devastated when they had 
to shoot the dogs and Mrs. Chippy for food and lack of space in the 
lifeboats. 
</P>
<P>
	In particular, she praised Shackleton's leadership and  
indomitable optimism. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ultimately, it's his story. It's his leadership that made this  
possible,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have done it,'' Shackleton wrote to his wife. ``Not a life  
lost and we have been through Hell.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Warns of Icy China Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- His China policy under attack, President  
Clinton warned Wednesday that a souring of relations resulting from 
a ``campaign-driven cold war'' with China could erase the gains 
that he claimed for his policy of engagement with Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton commented in an address on China policy before Chinese  
Premier Zhu Rongji arrived here for two days of talks on security 
issues, trade, Taiwan and other subjects. 
</P>
<P>
	In advance of Zhu's arrival, some Republicans have been seizing  
on alleged nuclear spying by China at secret U.S. facilities as 
well as fresh charges that the chief of China's military 
intelligence directed $300,000 to Clinton's re-election campaign in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the next presidential election approaches, we cannot allow  
a healthy argument to lead us toward a campaign-driven cold war 
with China, for that would have tragic consequences,'' Clinton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them, he said, would be ``an end to diplomatic contacts  
that have produced tangible gains for our people, a climate of 
mistrust that hurts Chinese-Americans and undermines the exchanges 
that are opening China to the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only beneficiaries, he added, would be ``the most rigid  
backward-looking elements in China itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu, whose six-city U.S. tour began Tuesday in Los Angeles, has  
acknowledged that serious differences could arise in his visit. 
</P>
<P>
	Describing himself in a pre-departure Wall Street Journal  
interview as ``an ordinary Chinese with a bad temper,'' Zhu said, 
``When I go to the U.S., it's very possible I'll have arguments 
with you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is expected to register China's differences with the United  
States on NATO's air war in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	One unresolved issue is China's bid to join the World Trade  
Organization, which would open China's vast markets to American 
exports. U.S. and Chinese negotiators have spent long hours this 
week attempting to work out the final details in time for Zhu's 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said Wednesday he  
opposes U.S. attempts to help China join the WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rewarding China with WTO membership shows how desperate this  
administration is for an agreement -- any agreement -- during the 
visit of China's prime minister,'' Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials declined to discuss the substance of the  
allegations concerning campaign finance and nuclear spying, citing 
ongoing investigations of both issues. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the House Government  
Reform and Oversight Committee, called on Clinton to insist China 
provide U.S. investigators bank records that ``would demonstrate 
the origins of the millions of dollars that flowed'' from China to 
the Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said American engagement with Beijing has yielded  
security benefits for the United States on a range of foreign 
policy hotspots from northeast Asia to the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other advances, Clinton said U.S. ties with China helped  
the administration negotiate a nuclear freeze with North Korea five 
years ago and persuade China to stop selling weapons-related 
nuclear materials to Pakistan and Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, apparently intent on not inflaming Zhu on the eve of  
his White House visit, softened the administration's rhetoric on 
human rights and offered only passing mention of Tibet in his 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton praised the advances in the rights situation in China  
over the past decade and said it is in China's own interest to 
establish a more open society. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because wealth is generated by ideas today, China will be less  
likely to succeed if its people cannot exchange information 
freely,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``China also will be less likely to succeed if it does not build  
the legal and political foundation to compete for global capital; 
less likely to succeed if its political system does not gain the 
legitimacy that comes from democratic choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif.,  
urged Clinton to use Zhu's visit to step up pressure on China to 
respect human rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Pelosi said Clinton publicly should request the release of the  
hundreds of political prisoners still held since from the Tiananmen 
Square crackdown in 1989 and ask Beijing to review all cases 
involving political prisoners.

<HEADLINE> Mo Vaughn Joins Walking Wounded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Welcome to the club, Mo. The jinxed club  
known as the Anaheim Angels. 
</P>
<P>
	It took Mo Vaughn mere minutes to initiate himself as a member  
of the Angels' walking wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Two batters into the season opener, Vaughn sprinted to the  
Cleveland dugout for a foul pop, tumbled down the steps and 
sprained his left ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	After a few moments, Vaughn got from the dugout floor, made it  
up the steps and onto the field. But he was limping. 
</P>
<P>
	His next time at-bat, the Angels first baseman hit a fly to left  
and crumpled in a heap in the batter's box, his ankle giving way. 
Then he told manager Terry Collins he couldn't go any more. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time Troy Glaus hit an RBI double in the eighth for the  
go-ahead run in Anaheim's 6-5 win Tuesday, Vaughn was at the 
hospital being X-rayed. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one likes to go to the hospital,'' he said. ``A lot of  
things go through your mind on the drive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Fracture'' was probably one of those things. But the X-rays  
were negative and the diagnosis was a sprain. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins is accustomed to players getting hurt in weird ways.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a possibility he will miss a few days,'' he said. ``We're  
lucky (it wasn't broken), but sprains can be no fun. Sometimes a 
sprain can be almost as bad as a break.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn doesn't know how long he will be sidelined.  
</P>
<P>
	``I won't commit until I know for sure, but I guarantee you it  
won't be too long,'' said Vaughn, who went 0-for-2 in his debut 
after signing a six-year deal with the Angels during the winter. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are 161 more games and the most important thing is it's  
not broken and we've got a win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Angels already were without shortstop Gary DiSarcina, who  
broke his forearm when struck by a fungo bat in spring training, 
and center fielder Jim Edmonds, who has a cyst in his right 
shoulder. DiSarcina isn't expected back until July, and Edmonds is 
on the DL. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the Angels' history, which includes a host of  
debilitating September injuries, Vaughn said he isn't buying the 
star-crossed angle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to hear any talk about curses,'' he said.  
``Things just happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn could be used as the DH until he's completely well.  
</P>
<P>
	Still, Collins fretted about a lineup already being shredded.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've got Jim Edmonds down. If we lose Mo for any extended  
period of time ... You can only take so many body blows,'' the 
manager said. ``Somebody's just going to have to step up and do the 
job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glaus did it in Tuesday's opener.  
</P>
<P>
	``This game it was me, next game it will be somebody else,''  
Glaus said. ``This team has maybe 12 guys who are capable of 
carrying the load for a game, or for a week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you can really depend on one player to do it  
all.''

<HEADLINE> Elderly Tell of High Drug Costs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Jo Sayward, 78, thought she might save some money  
if she asked her doctor for a less expensive medication for her 
cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why don't you give me something else?'' she told the doctor.  
</P>
<P>
	She tried an alternative -- with poor results. After three

	Now, she says, ``I have to go back, unless I want to die'' -- to  
the old medicine that cost $400 for every prescription refill. 
</P>
<P>
	Sayward's story was just one of many harrowing tales of high  
prescription costs for the elderly told at a recent Statehouse 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	How did the prescription crisis arise?  
</P>
<P>
	Medicare patients, who are entitled to health care because they  
are 65 and over, can either use a traditional health insurance plan 
or they can join a Medicare HMO. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, there were about 211,500 elderly people in Medicare  
HMOs in Massachusetts, about a quarter of the total people eligible 
for Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts had a unique law requiring the HMOs to offer at  
least one plan that provided unlimited prescription drug coverage, 
but a federal judge in Boston ruled in October that, under federal 
law, the HMOs didn't have to provide that plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The major HMOs -- Tufts, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, Fallon  
Community Health Plan, and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of 
Massachusetts -- have now instituted limited drug benefits and 
special plans to help low-income people pay for their drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	But Geoff Wilkinson, executive director of the Massachusetts  
Senior Action Council, estimated that perhaps 15,000 elderly 
residents are going to have to pay more because their drug costs 
exceed the limited benefits offered by the HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
	Some will have to pay a little more; others, like a woman who  
estimated her yearly drug expenses at $10,000, could have to pay a 
lot more. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State William Galvin, who has been nettled by the  
HMOs' withdrawal of the benefit, called the situation a ``public 
health crisis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Attorney General Thomas Reilly said he plans to launch an  
examination of pricing and sales practices of pharmaceutical 
companies in Massachusetts. His office will report its findings 
later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're up against an avalanche that we cannot hold back, the  
rising price of drugs,'' said Reilly, whose office is fighting to 
reverse the federal ruling on unlimited prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Trewhitt, a spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Researchers  
and Manufacturers of America, said drug prices were high because 
they reflected the rising price of developing new drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Like other witnesses at the hearing, Reilly said he supported  
loosening the eligibility requirements and increasing the benefits 
from an existing state program that provides prescription help to 
low-income elderly people. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Harriette Chandler, the House chairman of the Health Care  
Committee, said she supported that, as well as a ``catastrophic'' 
drug program that would cover people, even those with moderate 
incomes, if they face massive prescription costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Patty Blake, vice president in charge of the Tufts Health Plan  
Medicare HMO, applauded the committee's discussion of government 
help in paying for prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's really a positive step forward,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Blake said, however, the ``root cause'' was that Medicare  
doesn't cover prescription drugs.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton dismissed Yugoslavia's  
cease-fire in Kosovo as a hollow promise and said today the United 
States and NATO are ``determined to stay united and to persist 
until we prevail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After two weeks of NATO airstrikes on Belgrade and strategic  
command centers of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, Clinton 
said, the Western alliance is not about to ease up. Milosevic, whom 
Pentagon officials called ``rattled'' by the bombing campaign, 
declared a unilateral cease-fire of his security forces in the 
Kosovo province Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not enough now for Mr. Milosevic to say that his forces  
will cease fire on a Kosovo denied its freedom and devoid of its 
people,'' Clinton said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``He must withdraw his forces, let the refugees return, permit  
the deployment of an international security force. Nothing less 
will bring peace with security to the people of Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president touted NATO determination while Pentagon officials  
cast its military campaign as a success in shaking Milosevic and 
hurting morale among his armed forces, which are struggling with 
fuel and ammunition shortages and bombed-out command centers. 
</P>
<P>
	Serb air defenses remain a threat to NATO aircraft, however.  
Widely scattered tanks and troops accused of leading an ethnic 
cleansing campaign against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo are still 
proving difficult to strike despite a stepped-up allied air 
campaign that was taking advantage of clear skies today to hit more 
targets, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force Maj. Gen. Charles Wald, vice director for strategic  
plans and policy for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said today the low- 
and slow-flying ``tank killer'' A-10 aircraft hit Serb forces in 
Kosovo overnight, the first time the Warthogs struck enemy targets 
in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``The early reports are excellent,'' Wald said of the A-10  
strikes, but he didn't provide details about how many tanks might 
have been hit or destroyed in the ``engagement zone'' between Serb 
army and police and ethnic Albanians who are still fighting the 
Yugoslav forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, Rear Adm. Thomas Wilson, director of intelligence  
for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, acknowledged few troops or tanks had 
been struck, mainly because they're hiding in mountainous terrain 
or are too close to innocent refugees. Nonetheless, Wilson said, 
``We have evidence of units that had to go into holding operations 
or holding patterns because of shortages of ... gas and ammo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, the acting president of Cyprus said he would go to  
Belgrade today to work for the release of three U.S. soldiers who 
were captured by Serbs while patrolling the Yugoslav-Macedonian 
border. Dawn Reliford, sister of one of the three, Staff Sgt. 
Christopher J. Stone of Smiths Creek, Mich., said the family had 
been told of the effort by Pentagon officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cypriot official, Spyros Kyprianou, said he had conducted  
``informal consultations'' for several days. In Washington, Sandy 
Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, said he was aware of 
the effort to gain the release of the three ``but I can't confirm 
that is going to take place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson cited ``anecdotal reports that morale is declining'' in  
the Serb military following this past week's most devastating U.S. 
cruise missile and bomb strikes on army and police headquarters, 
fuel and ammunition depots throughout Yugoslavia and an 
intelligence training facility outside Belgrade. Wilson didn't 
offer any estimates of Serb military casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	In a sign that Milosevic is feeling the effects of NATO  
airstrikes that began March 24, he announced a unilateral 
cease-fire Tuesday and offered to allow ethnic Albanians back into 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	After pushing about half the 2 million Kosovo population out of  
the Serbian province since February 1998 -- more than 400,000 ethnic 
Albanians in the past two weeks -- Milosevic may feel he has changed 
the situation on the ground to his advantage. Previously, Kosovo 
was about 10 percent Serbian. 
</P>
<P>
	Intensified NATO airstrikes have led to increased reports of  
civilian casualties. In the worst case so far, an allied bomb went 
astray Monday night and hit apartment buildings in the mining town 
of Aleksinac, about 100 miles south of Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen was visiting NATO headquarters  
in Brussels, Belgium, today to consult with authorities there on 
the latest Kosovo developments. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and NATO foreign ministers  
will meet in Brussels on Monday to review diplomatic and military 
actions, discuss aiding refugees and to prepare for a NATO summit 
in Washington later in the month, the State Department announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to mend fences Tuesday, Vice President Al Gore telephoned  
Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who has vigorously opposed 
the bombing. Gore told reporters on Air Force Two on a trip to 
California that he spoke with Primakov for about an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are trying to limit damage to the U.S.-Russian  
relationship,'' Gore said. ``He and I have a very good personal 
relationship. The call was businesslike.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berger acknowledged that Gore and Primakov talked about Kosovo.  
``The vice president simply made clear to Prime Minister Primakov 
what it was that NATO expected Mr. Milosevic to do to end this 
bombing campaign,'' Berger said. ``To the extent Russia or anyone 
else can convince Mr. Milosevic to accede to these conditions, so 
much the better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, an NBC-Wall Street Journal poll found that almost  
two-thirds of the American public supports the airstrikes. Just 
over half, 53 percent, say they would support ground troops if 
Serbians continue to drive people out of Kosovo. That slight 
majority of support for ground troops was reflected in polls 
earlier this week by both Newsweek and ABC News. And 54 percent in 
the NBC-Wall Street Journal poll approve of the job President 
Clinton is doing with Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	That support grows to almost three-fourths, 73 percent, if  
ground troops are the only way to stop the fighting in Kosovo, 
according to the NBC-Journal poll released today. The poll of 503 
people taken Monday has an error margin of plus or minus 4.5 
percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Noted Jazz Musician Red Norvo Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- Red Norvo, who performed with such  
greats as Charles Mingus and Frank Sinatra and is credited with 
introducing the xylophone to jazz, has died. He was 91. 
</P>
<P>
	Norvo died Tuesday at the Fireside Convalescent Home, grandson  
Aaron Corlin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a fabulous man,'' Corlin said. ``He was always thinking  
about music, it was his life. ... His position in jazz history says 
a lot for itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born Kenneth Norville in Beardstown, Ill., he taught himself how  
to play piano and xylophone. By age 17, he was touring with a 
vaudeville show and later joined the Paul Ash Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
	His last name changed to Norvo after Ash mispronounced it to a  
reporter and Norvo's manager decided the shorter name was more 
fitting. 
</P>
<P>
	During Norvo's tenure with Paul Whiteman's Orchestra, which he  
joined in 1932, he met singer Mildred Bailey, whom he later 
married. By 1935, he formed his own sextet that played in clubs on 
New York City's 52nd Street. 
</P>
<P>
	In subsequent years, Norvo and his wife, who were known as ``Mr.  
and Mrs. Swing,'' formed several groups in New York and Chicago. 
Among their hits in the 1930s were ``Rockin' Chair,'' ``Please Be 
Kind,'' ``Says My Heart'' and ``Have You Forgotten So Soon?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1943, he switched from xylophone to vibraphone, which he  
played almost exclusively for the rest of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1945, Norvo joined the Benny Goodman orchestra, and a year  
later played with Woody Herman's orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to leading his own small groups, forming a trio in  
1950 that included Tal Farlow on guitar and Mingus on bass. He also 
toured and appeared on television with Sinatra. 
</P>
<P>
	Norvo continued to perform through the early 1990s, when he  
suffered a stroke that ended his public performances. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bailey, whose likeness was featured on a 1996 U.S. postage  
stamp, died in 1951. Norvo later married Eve Rogers, who died in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides his grandson, Norvo is survived by his daughter, Portia.  
Funeral arrangements were pending.

<HEADLINE> WNBA Stocks Two Expansion Teams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Minnesota Lynx picked Brandy Reed of Phoenix  
and the Orlando Miracle took Andrea Congreaves from Charlotte with 
the first selections in today's WNBA expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota's other picks were Kim Williams of Utah, Octavia Blue  
of Los Angeles and Adia Barnes of Sacramento. The Miracle also 
selected Kisha Ford of New York, Yolanda Moore of Houston and 
Adrienne Johnson from Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed, who played at Southern Mississippi, averaged 5.2 points in  
24 games with Phoenix last season. Congreaves, who came to the WNBA 
from Britain after playing at Mercer, averaged 4.3 points in 24 
games with Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Nykesha Sales from the Connecticut was allocated to  
Orlando and Kristin Folkl of Stanford was assigned to Minnesota. 
Each team will receive a second allocated player at the WNBA draft 
on April 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the existing 10 WNBA teams were allowed to protect six  
players and lose no more than one in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The league is scheduled to begin its third season June 10,  
provided there is a settlement of a labor dispute. The league has 
given the players until Saturday to come to terms on a contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The union wants a minimum salary of $45,000 for the three-month  
summer season. The WNBA is proposing $20,000, according to the 
union.

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Cops Get Etiquette Lesson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``Hello, ma'am. Drop the gun, please.''  
</P>
<P>
	New York's finest are getting a manners lesson from Mayor  
Rudolph Giuliani, who wants the nearly 40,000 police officers to be 
a little more civil, professional and courteous. 
</P>
<P>
	``Police officers are going to be required to refer to people in  
a respectful way,'' Giuliani said Tuesday. ``They will be required 
to refer to people as `Yes, sir' and `No sir' and `Yes, ma'am' and 
`No, ma'am.' 
</P>
<P>
	``And they will be required to explain the nature of their  
conduct when they make a mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lest they forget all of this in a city that prides itself on  
being brusque, officers will have wallet-size cards listing the 
common courtesies. 
</P>
<P>
	Teens will be referred to as young men and women, and police are  
urged to respect ``each individual, his or her cultural identity, 
customs and beliefs.'' Officers should apologize for any 
inconvenience. 
</P>
<P>
	The initiative follows the indictment of four white police  
officers on second-degree murder charges in the Feb. 4 shooting 
death of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed black West African immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting has polarized the city and urban leaders have  
complained that cops are frequently rude to those they encounter, 
especially minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil  
Liberties Union, called the politeness plan inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the department needs to do is bring in outside people  
from the civil rights and civil liberties communities, as well as 
professional experts who can address the issue of racism in the 
department,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the street, the effort brought mixed responses.  
</P>
<P>
	``Anything that will force those bully boys cops to treat folks  
better is a step forward,'' said Eugene Caroll, 26. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence Patrick, 45, called the plan ``a joke.''  
</P>
<P>
	``What, so they're going to politely tell you that they're going  
to rough you up?'' he asked. ``Please.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the plan, Officer Vincent Martinelli told The New  
York Times: ``I think it's ridiculous ... courtesy and honesty and 
politeness should come naturally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani's other quality-of-life initiatives have targeted,  
among others, jaywalkers, squeegee men, sidewalk vendors, 
panhandlers, speeders, drunken drivers and sex shop operators. 
</P>
<P>
	As far as the latest attempt, Giuliani said the public also will  
be expected to be courteous: ``It's a two-way street.''

<HEADLINE> The Online Trainer to the Stars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- He's known in Hollywood as the  
X-man, fitness guru to the stars. 
</P>
<P>
	He's buff and tan, but no bodybuilder.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm more of an athlete. I'm not like a steroided-out muscle  
boy, not that there's anything wrong with bodybuilding,'' said 
Xavier Carrica, who runs a Web site for hard-body celebrities too 
busy to drive to the gym, as well as roly-poly show business 
executives too shy to pump iron in public. 
</P>
<P>
	They log on to the Internet for fitness help.  
</P>
<P>
	And sometimes, a scolding.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pretty direct with people,'' said Carrica, who has helped  
Salma Hayek, Bronson Pinchot and others get lean. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, he dispenses much of his ``no pain, no gain'' mantra  
from a computer terminal in his West Hollywood home. 
</P>
<P>
	But he still does one-on-one personal training sessions with  
celebrities like Elizabeth Taylor, Kevin Spacey and Cheryl Tiegs. 
Prices start at $125 for a one-hour session. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrica, 37, recently helped actress Paula Cale of NBC-TV's  
``Providence'' slim down. ``I took her from being pregnant to 
getting svelte,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Personal training sessions take place in home gyms or in a local  
gym or beach club. ``This is Hollywood. It's no big deal here,'' 
Carrica said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrica is one of the many personal trainers who keep  
celebrities in shape and often take on the role of friend, 
bodyguard or confidante. 
</P>
<P>
	``The majority of time I feel like a therapist,'' he laughed.  
</P>
<P>
	When Carrica opened his virtual gym concept 18 months ago, he  
charged $30 a month for personalized diet and workout advice by 
e-mail. He quickly had 100 clients. His Web site now offers an 
annual $50 membership. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just kept expanding, so to accommodate everybody, I got  
sponsors and opened it up to anyone who wants to look at the 
workout and meal plans or specific exercises,'' Carrica said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm now over 1,000 members, and there was no way for me to  
work with them individually. It works out better,'' he explained. 
``They pick and choose the various meal plans and exercises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site's mission is to help people who hate going to the  
gym but need some sort of personal interaction to work out at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's partly because they are shy, partly because they don't  
want to spend the money to go to the gym or hire a personal 
trainer,'' Carrica said. ``I took the tricks of the trade and 
posted it on a site, and people come to learn from someone they 
trust. Some people just want to fine-tune from the comfort of their 
homes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 10 percent to 15 percent need special attention.  
</P>
<P>
	``These people usually are really overweight and shy. This is  
something simple for them. I don't promise a lot, but I make myself 
available for motivation,'' the X-Man said. ``They e-mail me 
constantly. I guarantee a reply within 24 hours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He still hears a litany of excuses.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have people who come back and say it's not working. I e-mail  
them and ask what they did in the past week and tell them what the 
problem is,'' he said. ``I can be pretty direct with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His Web site allows surfers to download video demonstrations of  
Carrica doing the exercises he prescribes. There are also links to 
companies that sell fitness products. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrica's dreams, though, are awaiting advances in technology.  
Video streaming is still too slow, but faster modems on the horizon 
mean he could soon be hosting his own live virtual gym Internet 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I eventually want to do is turn it into a program, like a  
television program. 'X-Time' sounds good, doesn't it? I could put a 
pretty cool show together that is celebrity-driven,'' he said. ``I 
want to do something fun, informative and entertaining.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> New Course May Hurt Long Hitters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- It's a course Bobby Jones would still  
recognize, despite some alterations. But the games of Tiger Woods 
and David Duval might not be as familiar to the late Masters 
co-founder, 65 years after he gathered friends and fellow 
competitors for his first spring get-together. 
</P>
<P>
	With long hitters having changed the game of golf, the Masters  
opened today with a belated effort by Augusta National to strike 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	Masters officials reluctantly made their biggest course changes  
ever this year, fearful that shaved, undulating greens and tight 
fairways were no longer enough to help a course measuring under 
7,000 yards fight off the assault on par. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone likes them.  
</P>
<P>
	``Bobby Jones would turn over in his grave,'' Gary Player said  
of the changes made to the 17th hole. 
</P>
<P>
	The course still looks much the same, except for the new light  
layer of rough that lines the expansive fairways. 
</P>
<P>
	But things might actually have improved for the big hitters by  
alterations that included toughening a pair of par-5s and making 
the Eisenhower tree on No. 17 a potential nightmare for the shorter 
hitters. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the changes, I think, are beneficial to the long  
hitters,'' Woods said. ``There's no doubt about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the big hitters can still blow it over the pine tree  
looming on the left side of the 17th fairway, guys like defending 
champion Mark O'Meara will have to try and cut the ball around the 
tree after the tee was moved back 25 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the kind of change that would make it awfully difficult for  
O'Meara to hit the driver and 9-iron to 7 feet for a birdie that 
gave him a chance to win last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't hit it over the tree now,'' O'Meara said. ``It's the  
kind of change that favors the long hitters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods, whose runaway win two years ago sparked the  
``Tiger-proofing'' changes, was again a crowd favorite as he teed 
off in search of a second green jacket to add to the one he won by 
12 shots in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The oddsmakers favor Duval, though, who is plenty long himself  
off the tee and is riding a hot streak like golf hasn't seen since 
Johnny Miller was in his prime in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I'm capable of winning out here,'' said Duval, who  
finished second last year when O'Meara sank a 20-foot birdie putt 
on the final hole to win his first major. 
</P>
<P>
	An elite field of 96 -- bigger than usual because of changes in  
the selection process -- played in the first threesomes since 1962 
to try and finish the day in timely fashion. They found a course 
with the usual slick greens and funny bounces, though with two new 
tee boxes as well as some strategically placed pine trees. 
</P>
<P>
	There's even a cut of rough to stop balls that would once bound  
into trees and to make it more difficult for players to stop their 
balls on the green. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously they've made some changes and the course will be  
tougher,'' said Fred Couples, who won in 1992 and led on the final 
day last year before finishing tied with Duval for second. 
``There's no way they're going to be lower.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To win at Augusta, though, there's one thing every champion has  
to do -- putt well on the icy greens. O'Meara showed that last year 
when Couples and Duval outplayed him tee to green, but O'Meara sank 
birdie putts on three of the last four holes to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were talking, Tiger, O'Meara and myself, and you know you  
always have to putt well to win any tournament,'' said Spanish 
amateur star Sergio Garcia. ``If you don't make putts, you aren't 
going to be the winner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While golf fans are hoping for a Woods-Duval showdown that might  
spark a rivalry not seen since the days Arnold Palmer and Jack 
Nicklaus dueled each other, there are a number of other contenders 
lurking just behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Ernie Els beat both Woods and Duval down the stretch to win in  
Los Angeles earlier this year, and the two-time U.S. Open champion 
has just the right combination of length and putting touch to be a 
contender here. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone badly wants to win,'' Els said. ``I want to win this  
tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who won't win are Palmer, playing in a  
record-breaking 45th straight Masters, four of which he has won. 
</P>
<P>
	The 69-year-old Palmer, though, hasn't played past on the  
weekend in 15 years at Augusta National. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe lightning will strike on Friday and I'll make the cut,''  
the ever-hopeful Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Six-time champion Jack Nicklaus also won't be in contention  
after playing in 40 straight Masters. Nicklaus is still recovering 
from surgery to replace his hip and did no more than hit a 5-iron 
on No. 12 Tuesday while touring the course to see the changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``For Jack not playing here, it's like losing the diamond out of  
a ring,'' Greg Norman said. ``He's it. It will be a sad week, 
honestly, from a player's perspective.''

<HEADLINE> More Refugees for Enclave in Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When thousands of Cuban boat people were  
picked up by the U.S. Coast Guard and taken to the Guantanamo naval 
base in eastern Cuba five years ago, the sense of despair among 
some was such that officials feared a violent uprising. 
</P>
<P>
	Those same concerns were discussed by officials this week as  
they debated whether Guantanamo was an appropriate temporary safe 
haven for 20,000 Kosovar Albanian refugees. In the end, Guantanamo 
was deemed acceptable because, officials said, they don't expect 
the stay to be very long. 
</P>
<P>
	The refugees should begin arriving before the end of the week  
under rules that will permit a stay of up to 18 months. But 
officials envision a much shorter actual time frame. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope to have them back in six months,'' says Brian Atwood,  
the Clinton administration's foreign aid chief and coordinator for 
the its humanitarian response to the Kosovo crisis. By that time, 
he believes, the pressure of NATO bombing will have persuaded 
Yugoslavia to allow the safe return of the Kosovar Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	The 20,000 are part of estimated 120,000 ethnic Albanian  
refugees who will be granted temporary asylum in a variety of 
countries, mostly European. Besides the United States, the only 
non-European countries granting Kosovar Albanians temporary asylum 
are Canada and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has been at pains in recent days to emphasize  
the temporary nature of the asylum. By agreeing to provide a safe 
haven for the time being, officials say the participating countries 
are not aiding and abetting Yugoslavia's forced expulsion campaign 
against Kosovar Albanians but are recognizing the humanitarian 
realities the refugees face. 
</P>
<P>
	Of particular concern are the distressed masses stranded in  
Kosovo near the Macedonian border. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no other way to save lives except to move families  
away from area for a temporary period of time,'' Atwood told 
reporters Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Another reason for easing the refugee pressure on Macedonia,  
Atwood said, was that the United States did not want the refugee 
crisis to imperil the country's fragile democracy. 
</P>
<P>
	This has been a hectic decade for Guantanamo. First, Haitian  
boat people were sent there, and later disaffected Cubans. In 1994, 
the Clinton administration warned Cubans fleeing economic 
desperation that their hopes of reaching U.S. shores were futile. 
</P>
<P>
	If captured by U.S. Coast Guard vessels, the boat people were  
warned, they would be transferred to the Guantanamo base -- with no 
hope of resettlement in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, officials did not take into account the rage of  
many of the 24,000 or so boat people condemned to Guantanamo's hot, 
dusty confines. They had fled Cuba expecting to be welcomed into 
South Florida's Cuban community, only to wind up at Guantanamo. 
</P>
<P>
	In desperation, some refugees there drank gasoline or drove  
stakes into their limbs -- all in the hope that emergency medical 
evacuation to South Florida would be their ticket to freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration stood firm, telling the Cubans their  
cause was hopeless. It reassessed its policy, however, after U.S. 
military officials on the island decided that the desperation level 
was such that a violent explosion was possible, particularly when 
summer temperatures exceeded the 100-degree mark. 
</P>
<P>
	In May 1995, the administration announced that all Cubans in  
Guantanamo would be free to resettle in the United States as part 
of a broader deal with the Cuban government. 
</P>
<P>
	The 20,000 refugees who will be sent to Guantanamo will not be  
eligible to apply for asylum or any other benefit because 
Guantanamo is a military base, not U.S. territory. They are being 
given temporary refuge and the goal is to return them to their 
homeland, Immigration and Naturalization Service spokesman Dan Kane 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But some analysts believe the Kosovar Albanians won't have to  
worry about being sent back to the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing as permanent as a temporary refugee,'' said  
Mark Krikorian, who heads an anti-immigration think tank. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people are not going home.''

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: `A Walk on the Moon' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The '60s are hurtling toward their end, and Pearl Kantrowitz  
(Diane Lane), a Jewish housewife from New York City, is feeling a 
bit penned in. She adores her kids but knows she had them too 
young. She loves her husband but wonders if he sees who she really 
is. 
</P>
<P>
	A gnawing feeling has taken root in Pearl's belly that life is  
passing her by and that the world, pushed by the tumult of the age, 
is moving at dizzying speed: The moon landing and Woodstock are 
just days away. The times are changing. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus the setting for ``A Walk on the Moon,'' a nuanced look at  
life in a Jewish bungalow colony in the late 1960s. The movie has 
the pace of one of the summers it chronicles, but cuts much deeper 
with its insights about how people make compromises -- and how they 
cope with their choices. 
</P>
<P>
	Pearl, her young son and her adolescent daughter Alison (Anna  
Paquin, with a flawless American accent) head up to the Catskills 
for the July holiday; her husband, Marty (Liev Schreiber), a TV 
repairman, stays behind in the city, furiously fixing televisions 
for the impending moon landing. 
</P>
<P>
	Freed from the confines of her urban apartment, Pearl begins to  
contemplate what she's been missing. Various sightings of hippies 
and images of the late 1960s -- rock music, tie-dyed T-shirts -- 
pique her interest and send her deeper into her self-review. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, one of the salesmen who passes through the bungalow  
community where the Kantrowitzes are staying catches her eye. 
Walker Jerome (Viggo Mortensen), an itinerant blouse hawker who 
oozes counterculture from every pore, looks at Pearl in a way her 
husband never did -- hungrily, openly. To Pearl, he is a conduit to 
worlds she has never experienced, and she falls with little 
resistance. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Alison is experiencing sexual stirrings of her  
own and trying to gauge what they mean. At the onset of puberty, 
Alison is a walking, talking bunch of emotions and hormones, and 
she looks to her mother and her paternal grandmother (Tovah 
Feldshuh, who plays the film's conscience) to help her cope. 
</P>
<P>
	To say more about the plot itself would be a disservice, since  
its twists and turns add extraordinary texture to the tale. Suffice 
it to say that both the moon landing and Woodstock figure 
prominently in the unraveling of the Kantrowitz family -- and in its 
members' ultimate, desperate attempt to keep their clan from 
collapsing entirely. 
</P>
<P>
	``A Walk on the Moon,'' sort of a Jewish/Catskills answer to the  
WASP/suburbia film ``The Ice Storm,'' is equally devastating in its 
chronicling of American discontent, especially the female variety. 
Pearl has love and security, and yet -- like so many women of her 
era -- she feels a gap deep inside, a dark spot she cannot define 
and cannot excise. 
</P>
<P>
	She feels that she missed her youth, and she sees a chance at  
liberation. She dives for it, not seeing -- or at least not fully 
understanding -- the damage she will wreak, especially in the eyes 
of her daughter. The script and the textured sense of place -- the 
Catskills are rendered full of unblemished highways, quiet 
bungalows and people who derive joy simply by being together -- are 
augmented by a series of wonderful performances. 
</P>
<P>
	Lane is just perfect as Pearl. Her every facial twitch, every  
glance, speaks to her internal conflict. Mortensen makes the ideal 
seductive hippie (and has in previous roles); his ability to ease 
from come-hither attractiveness into predatory sexuality is as 
unsettling as it is compelling. 
</P>
<P>
	Paquin, who won an Oscar for her supporting role in the 1993  
film ``The Piano,'' enters a new phase of her young career, 
exhibiting the depth and subtlety and roiled emotions so typical of 
the American girl she isn't in real life. Her first make-out 
session is under a full moon -- a moon populated, for the first 
time, with human beings. 
</P>
<P>
	And Schreiber makes a wonderful Marty, a man with a big heart  
and a big temper who ultimately must decide to do the right thing, 
whatever that is.	   Peppered with quiet experiences and wonderful small moments 
(``Guys I can kiss; bacon is a different story,'' an orthodox girl 
says to Alison), ``A Walk on the Moon'' is a harrowing, attentive 
and unique look at what the end of the 1960s meant to a small group 
of people. And in that tale, on a small canvas, is a bit of wisdom 
for the ages. 
</P>
<P>
	``A Walk on the Moon,'' a Miramax Films release, is directed by  
Tony Goldwyn from a Pamela Gray script. It is produced by a team of 
six people that included Dustin Hoffman. It is rated R.

<HEADLINE> Contractors Sued For Overbilling U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- Two contractors overcharged the Energy  
Department by at least $85 million for cleanup work at the Hanford 
nuclear weapons installation, a former accountant for the 
contractors says in a whistle-blower lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Westinghouse Hanford Co. and Fluor Daniel Hanford Inc. used a  
computerized accounting scheme to pad its bills, according to David 
Carbaugh, the former accountant. 
</P>
<P>
	Carbaugh's lawsuit, filed Tuesday in federal court, seeks $240  
million in damages for the alleged overbilling. 
</P>
<P>
	Fired in 1997 after complaining to supervisors about the  
billing, Carbaugh is also seeking unspecified damages relating to 
his dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department decided not to join the lawsuit, a point  
the defendants said is evidence that the allegations are 
groundless. 
</P>

	``The Justice Department did a very lengthy and extensive  
investigation at the time and concluded there was no support for 
the allegations,'' said Jean McKenna, a spokeswoman for Fluor 
Daniel Hanford, a subsidiary of Irvine, Calif.-based Fluor Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS Corp. -- which Westinghouse purchased in 1995 before assuming  
CBS' name and selling off its industrial assets -- repeated Fluor 
Daniel's assertion in a statement.

<P>
	Hanford, built in 1943 as part of the World War II Manhattan  
Project, produced plutonium for the U.S. nuclear arsenal into the 
1980s.

	The 560-square-mile Energy Department site in southeastern  
Washington is considered the nation's most contaminated nuclear 
site.

<HEADLINE> Defects Moms Have Well-Formed Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Women with birth defects have normal babies a surprisingly high  
96 percent of the time, Norwegian researchers reported today in the 
New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Since many birth defects are at least partly genetic,  
researchers expected to find more of them among babies whose 
mothers had defects. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, they found that birth defects were seen in 3.8 percent  
of babies whose mothers had birth defects vs. 2.4 percent of those 
born to normal mothers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the usual finding of everything looks dark for that  
family,'' said researcher Rolv Skjaerven of the University of 
Bergen. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings are reassuring and fill a major gap in knowledge  
for experts who counsel couples on genetic risks, said Dr. Donald 
Mattison of Chicago, medical director for the March of Dimes. 
</P>
<P>
	``While there is an increased risk, it's at a level many people  
might feel comfortable with -- not a huge risk overall,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study looked at survival and childbearing rates for nearly  
460,000 females born between 1967 and 1982 in Norway, which 
maintains a national registry that lists birth defects found in the 
baby's first five days. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings mean that mothers with birth defects are 60 percent  
more likely than other women to have children with birth defects. 
But the overall risk of children with birth defects is very small 
to begin with. 
</P>
<P>
	When there are defects, they are often the same ones that the  
mothers have, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of the 1,100 mothers with birth defects had  
relatively minor ones, such as a clubfoot or a cleft lip or palate. 
Females with severe defects often do not make it to adulthood, and 
those who are survive are less likely than other women to have 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	Skjaerven said he was surprised that the figures were so low. A  
1994 study found that if one child in a family had a birth defect, 
the next baby was 7.6 times more likely than normal to have the 
same defect, and 1.5 times as likely to have other problems.

<HEADLINE> Long Bonds Rise, Short Bonds Fall / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Long-term bond prices rose Tuesday, but  
short-term Treasuries were lower as traders looked for direction on 
the course of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 1/4 point,  
or $2.50 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the 
opposite direction, fell to 5.50 percent from 5.52 percent Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds were mixed as traders awaited the next clues on inflation,  
which will appear in Friday's producer price index report. 
</P>
<P>
	Until then, investors have little information to suggest the  
economy is heating up enough to cause the Federal Reserve to raise 
interest rates. Higher rates would hurt the value of existing 
bonds, which pay a fixed rate of return. 
</P>
<P>
	But a recent spurt in oil prices has stirred some inflationary  
fears. 
</P>
<P>
	Expectations for subdued inflation and steady Fed policy have  
helped long-term bonds more than short-term maturities. 
</P>
<P>
	Government bonds recently have gained as investors sought a  
haven for their funds during the NATO-led airstrikes on Yugoslavia 
on worries that escalating strife in the Balkans would upset stock 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Wall Street remains as ebullient as ever. The Dow Jones  
industrial average rose 121.82 to 10,085.31 on Wednesday, another 
record, 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader bond market, prices of short-term and  
intermediate Treasury securities were unchanged to down 1/16 point, 
reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.39 percent as the  
discount was 4.28, unchanged from Tuesday. Six-month yields were 
4.52 percent, as the discount rose 0.01 percentage point from late 
Tuesday to 4.36. One-year yields were 4.66 percent as the discount 
rose by 0.02 percentage point to 4.44 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.38 percent from 4.50 percent late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose to 124 7/16 from 124 3/8 . The average 
yield to maturity was unchanged at 5.22 percent.

<HEADLINE> Pa. Toxic Site Wrongly Declared Safe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	QUAKERTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- A toxic dump site was mistakenly declared  
safe 18 years ago after federal inspectors went to the wrong site, 
raising fears among neighbors that they were poisoned rather than 
protected. 
</P>
<P>
	The Environmental Protection Agency arrived here recently to  
examine the dump -- where 3,200 tons of paints, pigments and resins 
were buried in the late 1960s -- after activists brought the 
situation to its attention last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the EPA is trying to determine whether the 86 acres in  
Eastern Pennsylvania is a threat to groundwater. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking at the ground water in residential wells and  
soil at the site to see if the landfill is a danger to the 
community,'' EPA spokeswoman Ruth Podems said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	During the EPA's original probe in 1981, agency officials  
visited the wrong site because of what Ms. Podems called 
``misinformation'' from county records. 
</P>
<P>
	High levels of arsenic have been found in nearby drinking water,  
but it is unclear if the contamination was caused by the dump. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Podems said the site doesn't appear to be particularly  
hazardous, but that is little comfort to Gerald Hardcastle, who 
lives a half-mile from the site. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardcastle recently found out his well has been contaminated  
with arsenic at 700 times the agency's risk level. The EPA said if 
consumed for many years, the water could pose an increased cancer 
risk. Hardcastle had been drinking the water since 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't know what was in that dump,'' he said. ``It could  
have been paint or anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The private dump, shut down in 1973, was once used by W.R. Grace  
Co., a Boca Raton, Fla.-based supplier of special chemical, 
construction and container products. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal records show that a W.R. Grace subsidiary sent tons of  
paints and resins to the dump in the late 1960s. Activists say 
there are no documents showing that the waste was ever removed. 
</P>
<P>
	Given that the EPA had to assess 20,000 dump sites nationwide at  
the time, Ms. Podems said it's not surprising that a mistake was 
made. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress gave us a tremendous task to find all the messes out  
there,'' she said. ``It's somewhat of a miracle that we got all the 
rest of them right.''

<HEADLINE> Libya Resumes Legal Flights Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Libyan Airlines celebrated the suspension of  
a U.N. air embargo by bringing home Muslim pilgrims from Saudi 
Arabia on Wednesday, while British Airways prepared to start up 
service to the Libyan capital. 
</P>
<P>
	The Libyan national carrier made its first international flight  
since Monday's suspension of the U.N. air embargo by flying to 
Malta and back, state-run Libyan Television said in a broadcast 
monitored in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
	A later flight brought back 159 pilgrims who had finished the  
hajj in Saudi Arabia. Libya had been violating the embargo every 
year since 1994 to fly its citizens to the annual pilgrimage in 
Mecca -- most recently with a March 18 flight. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. Security Council, which imposed the sanctions in 1991,  
suspended them Monday when Libya handed over two suspects charged 
in the 1988 bombing of an American airliner over Lockerbie, 
Scotland. The bombing killed 270 people. 
</P>
<P>
	British Airways announced Wednesday it would start flying three  
Boeing 737 flights a week from London to Tripoli later this month. 
The airline has never flown to the Libyan capital before. 
</P>
<P>
	An EgyptAir plane was scheduled to fly to Tripoli on Thursday,  
according to an official of Egypt's national carrier. Tunisia, 
Jordan, Syria and Malta have also announced their intention to 
resume regular flights to Libya. 
</P>
<P>
	Libyan Airlines' fleet of 12 planes requires upgrading and  
maintenance before it can be fully operational for international 
flights. Two planes have been rusting at Cairo airport since 1992. 
The remaining ones have been flying domestic routes. 
</P>
<P>
	A Libyan Airlines plane crashed on an internal flight in  
December 1992, killing 157 people. Lack of proper maintainance was 
blamed.

<HEADLINE> Russian Business Paper To Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Wall Street Journal, The Financial Times of  
London and the Moscow Times announced plans Wednesday to launch a 
Russian-language business newspaper for the Russian market. 
</P>
<P>
	The yet-to-be-named publication is to debut in August,  
publishing Tuesday through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	A staff of 20 Russian reporters and editors will staff the  
newspaper, which also will draw content, translated into Russian, 
from The Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper will be owned one-third each by Dow Jones &AMP;  
Company, publisher of The Wall Street Journal; Pearson PLC, 
publisher of The Financial Times; and Independent Media, publisher 
of The Moscow Times and the Russian editions of Cosmopolitan, Good 
Housekeeping, and Men's Health magazines. 
</P>
<P>
	Distribution of the new business newspaper will center on Moscow  
and St. Petersburg at first, with the expectation the paper will 
eventually become a national daily, the three companies said in a 
joint statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Russia poses some unique challenges and opportunities that  
require a unique response -- and that's what this venture is,'' said 
David Bell, chairman of The Financial Times Group. ``Joining forces 
both with Independent Media and Dow Jones &AMP; Company is an effective 
and relatively low risk way of creating the best business newspaper 
for Russia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Karen Elliott House, president of Dow Jones' international  
group, said, ``We think this new venture positions Dow Jones and 
The Wall Street Journal to take advantage of the vast potential of 
Eastern Europe's largest market, while maximizing our chances for 
success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leonid Bershidsky, 27, the business editor of the Moscow Times,  
was named editor of the new publication. Derk Sauer, CEO of 
Independent Media, will be managing director and publisher. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Robinson, former Moscow bureau chief for The Financial  
Times, will serve as consulting editor, overseeing the newspaper's 
use of Wall Street Journal and Financial Times news content on a 
day-to-day basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street Journal Europe editor Frederick Kempe will serve as  
supervisory editor. 
</P>
<P>
	The joint venture will be overseen by a six-person board of  
directors, with two representatives each from Independent Media, 
Pearson and Dow Jones.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Narrowly Mixed; Dow Up 29.41 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were narrowly mixed today after aluminum  
maker Alcoa released first-quarter earnings that soundly beat 
analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 29.41 at 9,992.90. Broader stock indicators were mostly higher. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent sessions, the fortunes of the Dow have turned on early  
indications of companies' first-quarter earnings. On Tuesday, 
Gillette's announcement that it expects to miss analyst estimates 
by one penny depressed consumer stocks and sent Gillette down 7 3/4. 
The Dow slipped 43.84 Tuesday to close at 9,963.49. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, traders were cautious although Alcoa gave them an upbeat  
earnings report. The metals company, a component of the Dow, said 
it earned 60 cents a share in the first quarter, while analysts 
surveyed by First Call Corp. had expected earnings of 54 cents a 
share. Alcoa shares rose 13/16 to 41 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders were anticipating an after-hours earnings release from  
Yahoo!, which was also expected to beat estimates. Its shares rose 
11/16 to 215 9/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Revlon rose 2 13/16 to 22 13/16 after the cosmetics maker said  
it is considering the sale of one or more of its businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. stock market drew strength today from overseas trading.  
European markets were strong for a second consecutive session. 
Japan's Nikkei index increased a solid 0.5 percent, and Hong Kong's 
Hang Seng soared 5 percent after a long holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 8.54 at 1,326.43, and the  
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was up 2.77 at 2,565.94. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues were ahead of advancers by a very slim margin  
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 249.6 million 
shares, ahead of Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 1.93 at 614.25, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 0.85 at 716.06.

<HEADLINE> Russia Prosecutor Attacks Yeltsin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's top prosecutor sought parliamentary  
support Wednesday in his personal battle with Boris Yeltsin, saying 
his suspension by the president was an attempt to conceal 
corruption in the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
	``Never before have corrupt officials cast such a brazen  
challenge to the law,'' Prosecutor General Yuri Skuratov said in a 
speech before parliament's lower house, the State Duma. ``Their 
goal is obvious -- to remove the inconvenient prosecutor general 
using all means.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Skuratov was invited to speak before the Duma by Communists and  
other hard-liners who hoped he would give them fresh ammunition to 
use against Yeltsin before an impeachment debate begins April 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Skuratov tried to rally support before the upper house of  
parliament again considers his resignation, which he submitted 
Tuesday. He said he was willing to stay if lawmakers support him. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin and Skuratov have been locked in battle for months.  
Yeltsin tried to fire him in February, but the upper house refused 
to back Yeltsin's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Right after that, state television ran a video that showed a man  
who appeared to be Skuratov having sex with two women identified as 
prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin suspended Skuratov last Friday, saying investigators  
were checking whether criminal suspects provided Skuratov with 
prostitutes in exchange for stalling investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	Skuratov fought back Wednesday, telling the lower house of  
parliament that Yeltsin's action was a ``flagrant violation of the 
law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He refused to name any of the allegedly corrupt officials he has  
accused of plotting against him, but threatened to reveal all 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they resort to even more flagrant lawless steps against me  
and I have no other choice, I may bring out the heavy artillery,'' 
he told the Interfax news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Skuratov's probe has focused on alleged bribery involving  
government officials who gave large construction contracts to the 
Swiss company Mabetex. No one has been charged, and Kremlin 
officials and Mabetex have denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite general support from communists and their allies  
Wednesday, Skuratov faced hostile questions relating to the steamy 
videotape. He refused to confirm or deny whether he was the man in 
the video. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can't tell us the truth like a real man. He is a coward!''  
shouted ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Skuratov also rebuffed accusations that he hasn't properly  
fought corruption and other crime since his appointment in 1995. He 
pointed out several high-profile cases and took credit for warrants 
issued Tuesday for the arrest of Russian tycoons Boris Berezovsky 
and Alexander Smolensky. 
</P>
<P>
	Berezovsky said in Paris that he plans to return to Moscow next  
week to face his accusers. He accused Prime Minister Yevgevy 
Primakov -- with whom Berezovsky has been battling for months -- of 
being behind the money-laundering charges and trying to turn back 
economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigator Nikolai Volkov of the Prosecutor General's office  
told Russia's NTV television Wednesday that Berezovsky was behind 
the illegal transfer of $250 million from Russia's largest airline 
Aeroflot to the Swiss company Andava. Berezovsky denies any 
wrongdoing.

<HEADLINE> Wanted in D.C.: Tree-Eating Beaver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The hunt is on for a beaver that's toppling  
cherry trees near the Jefferson Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Park Service began preparing traps Wednesday to  
catch the sharp-toothed rodent who's chewed his way through nine 
trees in less than a week, said spokesman Earle Kittleman. The 
beaver has damaged four others that officials don't expect to 
survive, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials bemoaned that he's chosen the middle of the capital's  
annual Cherry Blossom Festival for his destructive campaign. The 
festival celebrates the gift of 3,000 trees from Japan in 1912. The 
trees, which ring the Tidal Basin near the national Mall, flower 
for just two weeks each year and have been at their peak since 
Easter. 
</P>
<P>
	``And here comes this beaver who is certainly upstaging us  
all,'' Kittleman said. ``We're a bit chagrined, to say the least.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While there may be more than one culprit, officials believe it's  
a solo job, Kittleman said. Tourists and a Park Service naturalist, 
Julia Long, have spotted the flat-tailed varmint floating in the 
Potomac River, but they've only seen one, Kittleman said. 
</P>
<P>
	He's been a busy fellow, said officials, noting that bite marks  
and other damage to some 30 trees have appeared since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that the critter is actually felling trees, the Park Service  
is determined to trap him, but Kittleman said no one wishes him 
ill: ``We want to get him back into an area where he can do his 
natural thing.''

<HEADLINE>  Williams Impresses NFL Types </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- There was less of Ricky Williams on display  
during his personal workout for NFL scouts, which was a good thing 
with the draft less than two weeks away. 
</P>
<P>
	The running back was fast and 20 pounds trimmer than in  
mid-February, when he showed up at the NFL scouting combine 
weighing 244 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We liked it,'' said coach Chris Palmer of the Cleveland  
Browns, who hold the first pick in the draft April 17-18. ``What he 
did today was allow a lot of scouts, general managers and head 
coaches to rest easy tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That said, Browns officials don't have a clear-cut choice in  
mind. They are considering Kentucky quarterback Tim Couch, Oregon 
quarterback Akili Smith and Williams. The Browns are scheduled to 
work out Couch in Lexington, Ky., on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, the Heisman Trophy winner from Texas, went though a  
2-hour workout Tuesday at UC San Diego for scouts, coaches and 
general managers. With his dreadlocks tied back in two pigtails, he 
ran three 40-yard dashes, did some agility drills and pass-catching 
drills. 
</P>
<P>
	The proceedings then moved inside, and, with dozens of students  
looking on, Williams bench-pressed 225 pounds 22 times. 
</P>
<P>
	The big moment came when he weighed in at 224 pounds.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just worked really hard,'' said Williams, who went to high  
school in San Diego. ``We had to concentrate so much on losing the 
weight that maybe it took away from speed work, but I mean, I think 
the main thing was getting my weight down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, the NCAA career rushing leader with 6,279 yards, also  
made an impression with coach Andy Reid of the Philadelphia Eagles, 
who have the second pick in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``The No. 1 thing was that he has dropped the weight,'' Reid  
said. ``That's always a concern, somebody's up 20 pounds from a 
normal playing weight. You've just got to (come and) see. We 
understood that he had been on the banquet circuit. But he lost it 
and he looked sharp. That showed me a little something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Being on the rubber-chicken circuit was tough ``only because  
you're not working out,'' Williams said. ``Eating wasn't that bad, 
it's just that you're traveling so much that it's really hard to 
take time to work out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for his diet, ``I just kind of made up stuff,'' Williams  
said. ``I got by. It changed almost every day. I had to work 
extremely hard. It wasn't just strictly diet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hardest thing he gave up?  
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, all sweets. Doughnuts, cheesecake. That's about it. Just  
sweets. Right now I'm going to a doughnut shop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer said Williams was timed anywhere from 4.6 seconds to 4.72  
running against the wind in the 40, and anywhere from 4.43 to 4.52 
in two heats with the wind. Two other college players who were 
being timed, including Smith's cousin, Marquis, suffered hamstring 
injuries on the cold, blustery day. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those in the crowd of 200 watching the workout were  
Cleveland general manager Dwight Clark; Indianapolis GM Bill Polian 
and coach Jim Mora; New Orleans Saints GM Bill Kuharich; and 
Minnesota Vikings coach Dennis Green. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams is so highly regarded that Saints coach Mike Ditka said  
he would trade all six 1999 draft picks and additional future picks 
to move up in the first round and get him. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuharich said the Saints haven't had any discussions yet with  
other teams, ``but that will be part of the package.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams would like to go to Cleveland as the first pick.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great organization,'' he said. ``They have the best  
fans in the NFL. I just see myself fitting in in Cleveland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams and his agent, Leland Hardy, are scheduled to visit six  
teams in three days -- St. Louis and New Orleans today, Washington 
and Philadelphia on Thursday and Cleveland and Indianapolis on 
Friday.

<HEADLINE> US To Impose Tariffs in Banana Spat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States has been given the go-ahead  
to impose penalty tariffs on $191.4 million worth of European 
imports annually, getting to choose from a list that includes 
Scottish cashmere sweaters, fancy French handbags and German coffee 
makers. 
</P>
<P>
	The 100 percent tariffs, which are designed to eliminate the  
targeted products from U.S. stores, were awarded by the World Trade 
Organization on Tuesday as a fallout from a nasty trade war between 
the United States and Europe over bananas. 
</P>
<P>
	The WTO ruled that U.S. banana companies were suffering $191.4  
million in lost sales annually because of unfair European 
restrictions that favor bananas grown in former European colonies 
in the Caribbean and Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	While this represented a reduction of nearly two-thirds from the  
original U.S. damage claim of $520 million, the Clinton 
administration said the smaller figure was still the largest damage 
award ever approved by the WTO, the Geneva-based organization that 
sets the rules for world trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``This decision is an important victory for the WTO dispute  
settlement process and sends a clear message that the WTO cannot be 
used to engage in endless litigation,'' U.S. Trade Representative 
Charlene Barshefsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	EU officials said today that they would consult with member  
countries before deciding whether to appeal the WTO ruling. 
Officials said under WTO procedures, the United States has 10 days 
to submit a revised target list of products and during this time 
the EU has the option of appealing the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``We reserve the right to appeal,'' EU official Simon Fraser  
told reporters in Brussels. But he said the 15-nation EU had ``no 
intention of dragging this out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barshefsky said the final list of targeted products would be  
selected from the original target list and would be published 
within the next few days in the Federal Register. 
</P>
<P>
	EU officials have charged political motivations were behind the  
U.S. determination to start a trade war over a product that 
accounts for a minuscule amount of trade between the world's two 
biggest trading partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Two American companies, Chiquita Brands International and Dole  
Food Co., grow their bananas on plantations in South America. Carl 
Lindner, the head of Chiquita, has been a major campaign 
contributor to both Democrats and Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Clinton administration insisted that it has been  
fighting to uphold the principal that countries that lose cases 
before the WTO must either eliminate their unfair barriers or face 
economic penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Scher, America's top negotiator on agriculture matters,  
said the United States had prevailed on every major point in 
contention. EU officials said late Tuesday they were still studying 
the 150-plus-page WTO ruling and would have no immediate comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States began requiring importers to post 100 percent  
bonds on March 3 on the larger $520 million list of products but 
said it would reduce the ultimate penalties once the WTO ruled on 
the appropriate level of damages. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, EU Trade minister Leon Brittan charged that the  
United States was acting in an ``unacceptable and unlawful'' manner 
in requiring importers to post bonds before the WTO arbitration 
decision was made. 
</P>
<P>
	Scher said the banana ruling set an important precedent for a  
second trade fight the United States is waging with Europe over its 
ban on American beef containing growth hormones. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has published a separate list  
covering more than $900 million in imports and will hold a hearing 
on April 21 to receive public comments on what products should be 
targeted in the beef dispute. American cattle producers contend 
they are losing $500 million annually because of the hormone ban. 
</P>
<P>
	The original $520 million sanction list in the banana fight  
covered Louis Vitton handbags from France, sweet biscuits from 
Britain, Parma ham and pecorino cheese from Italy, German coffee 
makers and less fancy imports ranging from plastic packaging 
material to electric batteries. 
</P>
<P>
	The $900 million preliminary target list in the beef dispute  
included truffles and foie gras, Evian and Perrier mineral waters, 
Danish ham and Belgian chocolates.

<HEADLINE> Def Jam Founder Branches Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- While watching unedited footage from his new  
urban entertainment TV show, ``Russell Simmons' Oneworld Music 
Beat,'' a grimace suddenly appears on Russell Simmons' face. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not the show's content that has the rap mogul frustrated.  
Instead, it's the techno pop accompanying a segment on comedian 
Chris Rock that has crawled under Simmons' skin. 
</P>
<P>
	``That music is like anti-hip hop,'' complains the founder of  
Def Jam Records to a group of executives at the midtown offices of 
Warner Bros., which is distributing the show. ``Can't we get the 
Slick Rick music? We own that already. I much prefer to use that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though it has already been on for several months, Simmons is  
still trying to smooth out glitches in ``Oneworld,'' his latest 
attempt to bring the hip-hop culture to the masses. 
</P>
<P>
	With his new wife, model Kimora Lee, as host, the syndicated  
hourlong show, which usually airs late at night, offers profiles of 
artists like Mase and Lauryn Hill, along with the latest hip-hop 
news, trends and celebrity interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're going to make it a much, much better show. It's  
going to be like a magazine show that really is quoted, whether 
it's in colleges, campuses, or in any clubs,'' he predicts. 
``That's what I intend, to make like a really important source of 
information about the community, because the culture has grown so 
much that there is a big void there that we are filling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Simmons, it's a mission that has lasted most of his adult  
life. Long before Sean ``Puffy'' Combs became rap's best-known 
promoter, Simmons helped hip-hop grow from a cult following 20 
years ago to a mainstream phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
	But he is more than a behind-the-scenes industry executive. He's  
also a celebrity in his own right, his name popping up in gossip 
columns alongside Hollywood stars and society swells. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's unbelievably charismatic, is not afraid to talk and  
promote anybody, and lives in a bunch of different worlds,'' said 
Def Jam President Lyor Cohen. ``He is probably rap's greatest 
ambassador because he feels so comfortable in traveling in 
different worlds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons, 41, grew up in the Hollis section of the New York City  
borough of Queens. His mother was a social worker and his father 
taught history at Pace University. One of his two brothers is Run 
of the rap group Run DMC, one of the first acts Simmons helped to 
make famous. His older brother Danny is a painter who runs the Rush 
Philanthropic Arts Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Before rap's birth, the young Russell vibed to the edgy rhythm  
and blues of producers like Gamble &AMP; Huff and their Philadelphia 
sound. 
</P>
<P>
	``The black pop stuff, mostly I didn't care for that,'' he said.  
``A lot of the records that became rap beats later were the kind of 
records that I liked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He dropped out of the City College of New York just four credits  
shy of graduating and became a party promoter after his interest 
was sparked by a visit to a local club. He worked his way up to 
promoting and managing such acts as Kurtis Blow and Run DMC, and 
went on to help create Def Jam Records, the most influential label 
devoted to rap. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, as head of Rush Communications, he started ``Def Comedy  
Jam,'' television shows and tours that introduced comedy audiences 
to a new style of comedy, brash and urban, and launched the careers 
of Martin Lawrence and others. He also expanded into advertising, 
film and fashion. Phat Farm is one of the priciest and most 
sought-after labels. 
</P>
<P>
	Even during an interview, constant interruptions keep Simmons'  
attention jumping about. 
</P>
<P>
	Combs phones and wants to be outfitted in the latest Phat Farm  
goods (``Keep him under $3,000,'' Simmons says in a telephone call 
to his store); hot Def Jam rapper Redman stops in to talk about his 
latest CD; then Simmons gets confirmation of a major deal for his 
advertising company. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have a structured schedule. I work for everybody,'' he  
says. ``I work for the presidents of all the different companies. I 
do what they need. ... I help to promote a positive corporate 
culture and I give direction to a lot of people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Def Jam label is now enjoying perhaps its biggest success in  
years, with record-breaking and million selling albums from DMX, 
Foxy Brown, Jay-Z, Method Man and others. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet it hasn't always been smooth sailing for the company. Def  
Jam languished when California rap started making waves in the 
early 1990s, says Nelson George, author of ``Hip-Hop America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It had a definite down period for a couple of years where it  
lost its direction, and when the L.A. thing really came in, Def Jam 
suffered. They weren't able to react very well,'' said George, a 
longtime friend of Simmons. 
</P>
<P>
	But Simmons scoffs at parallels to other rap labels.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're the biggest rap label in the business. ... Our release  
schedule speaks for itself and our sales speak for themselves,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Def Jam's success is part of the continuing strength and growth  
of the hip-hop industry, which is finally gaining some respect 
among those who dismissed it as a fad. 
</P>
<P>
	Lauryn Hill of the Fugees recently won five Grammys for her  
critically acclaimed and best-selling album, ``The Miseducation of 
Lauryn Hill,'' while rappers Master P and Puff Daddy are among the 
highest-earning entertainers in the music business. 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons grows tired of hearing people express surprise that rap  
is still topping the charts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been here 20 years, rap. And every year, it's the same  
thing -- 'Are we going to peak this year?''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are all kinds of attitudes in hip-hop that are being  
represented and promoted. More likely, what we hear about is the 
negative, because that's what some people think is newsworthy, but 
it's certainly not what sells. What sells is a mixture, a good, 
honest mixture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Def Jam is so successful that Simmons has negotiated a deal to  
sell his 40 percent stake in the company to Seagram's Universal 
Music Group, its current distributor, for a price that could net 
him $100 million. He said he would still have a role in the company 
as chairman, and Universal's Mercury/Island Records would become 
part of Def Jam. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes perfect sense for me,'' he said. ``I need a bigger  
presence in music and I would get a bigger presence in music 
because of this merger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons is already working with Mercury/Island artists Dru Hill,  
and, more interestingly, Lionel Richie -- pairing the pop singer 
with some of rhythm and blues' hottest new producers. It's ironic, 
considering Simmons' declared hatred for rhythm and blues. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hated R&AMP;B in the state it was in,'' Simmons said. ``It was  
old. There was nobody talking to young people at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But not everything Simmons touches turns to gold.  
</P>
<P>
	His foray into film was a disaster. He started Def Jam Pictures  
with Polygram (a distributor of Def Jam Records until Polygram was 
absorbed by Universal), hoping to make the same impact in movies as 
in music. It didn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``My whole Hollywood thing was a joke,'' he said. ``I went out  
there to make movies for Polygram, and I basically got jerked 
around and wasted time and brought a house and didn't make any 
movies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Well, he did actually make some movies, but mostly on his own.  
His biggest success came as a producer of Eddie Murphy's ``The 
Nutty Professor.'' But ``How to Be a Player'' and ``Gridlock'd'' 
flopped. 
</P>
<P>
	But Simmons has no regrets.  
</P>
<P>
	``I knew it wasn't going to make any money,'' he said of ``The  
Funeral,'' the unsuccessful movie he made with director Abel 
Ferrara. 
</P>
<P>
	``But in terms of filmmaking, it was a better experience for me  
in terms of learning than making 'How to Be a Player'.'' 
</P>
<P>
	These days, much of his focus is on his fashion business. Phat  
Farm is now a multimillion-dollar business, and is probably the 
Rush Communications subsidiary that occupies most of his time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking at probably $50 million this year, without  
blinking, and that's a big number for us,'' he said. ``The only 
company that I think to this day will short circuit if I don't go 
to work is the clothing company, and that's because there is so 
much growth.''

<HEADLINE> Alcoa Reports Modest Income Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Alcoa's earnings rose 5 percent for the first  
quarter, partly due to acquisitions and production efficiencies 
that offset falling aluminum prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The results reported Wednesday beat Wall Street expectations and  
the stock surged $2.93 3/4 a share, or 7 percent, to $44 in trading on 
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's biggest aluminum producer earned $221.1 million, or  
60 cents a share, in the first three months of 1999 compared to 
$209.9 million, or 62 cents a share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The per-share income declined because Alcoa increased the number  
of its common shares outstanding by 31 million to 367 million 
shares with its purchase of Alumax last July. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call expected Alcoa earnings of 55  
cents per share on average. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales increased 15.6 percent to $3.98 billion from $3.45 billion  
from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcoa chairman Paul O'Neill said net income would have dropped  
$110 million without the production efficiencies and acquisitions 
of Alumax and Inespal. 
</P>
<P>
	Aluminum prices as reported on the London Metal Exchange have  
dropped 18 percent in the past year to their lowest level in five 
years, Alcoa spokeswoman Bonita Cersosimo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcoa purchased Inespal for $410 million in February 1998 and  
Alumax for $3.8 billion in July.

<HEADLINE> Ford, Dole Criticize Kosovo Tactics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Miscalculations by the White House have made the use of ground  
troops in Kosovo the only option short of NATO's defeat, former 
President Ford said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration overemphasized the power of  
airstrikes and underestimated the magnitude of the humanitarian 
crisis, Ford said in a telephone interview from his home in Rancho 
Mirage, Calif. ``The net result is they have two choices,'' he 
said. ``One choice is to go all-out and win the war with ground 
troops, or two, to quit and admit defeat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Continuing on the current course ``I don't think is going to do  
anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The air campaign drew a mixed review Wednesday from former Sen.  
Bob Dole, who served President Clinton as an envoy in Yugoslavia. 
Dole said the effort was suffering from poor preparation but 
appeared finally to be achieving some goals. 
</P>
<P>
	He said in an interview he cannot understand why it is taking so  
long to get Apache helicopters in place and it appears military 
leaders are generally running into some political interference. He 
also questioned why Clinton would rule out ground troops -- 
``telegraph your punches'' -- at the outset of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I support the general effort,'' Dole said. ``I think it comes  
years too late and I kind of hoped we'd been better prepared. A lot 
of ... just basic preparation wasn't done. But that's history and 
we have to deal with where we are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The air attacks, he said, are ``beginning to have an impact''  
even if the effort ``is not quite as rapid or intense as some of us 
had hoped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford, who has not often commented on Clinton's policies, said he  
told Vice President Al Gore when they talked at the beginning of 
the air campaign that he would publicly support the president's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the interview, the former Republican president said the  
Kosovo mission was a humanitarian one, not a matter of national 
security for the United States until its forces got involved. He 
hoped Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic could be persuaded to 
let NATO forces in to monitor the return of displaced ethnic 
Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would just hope that the threat of NATO air and ground  
operations would shock him into doing what's right,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As special emissary for Clinton, Dole helped bring the ethnic  
Albanians over to supporting an agreement, which the Serbs refused 
to endorse. The Serb refusal led to the NATO bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole was also instrumental, as Senate majority leader, in  
helping Clinton win Republican congressional approval for sending 
ground troops to Bosnia to support the peace agreement reached in 
late 1995, just as the two men were preparing to go head to head in 
the 1996 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to start second-guessing,'' Dole said of the NATO  
effort, acknowledging decisions unavoidably take time when 19 
member countries are involved. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said plans should have been made at least to permit rapid  
deployment of Apache helicopters, said to be capable of closely 
engaging Serb units too scattered or small for bombers. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said it may take a week to put the German-based  
Apaches in use because of strains on air transport caused by 
humanitarian flights and the complex support units required by the 
helicopters.

	Yugoslavia Stops Refugee Exodus  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslav authorities today prevented  
waves of ethnic Albanian refugees from leaving Kosovo by sealing 
off main border crossings with Albania today. After forcing more 
than 400,000 refugees out to neighboring countries, Yugoslav 
authorities closed the main exit route without explanation, forcing 
tens of thousands of people back toward the burned villages they 
had been escaping. Meanwhile, NATO stepped up its airstrikes, 
announcing their ``first major breakthrough against armored forces 
in the field'' in Yugoslavia.

	Yugoslav Army Moves Into Montenegro  
</P>
<P>
	PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslav forces positioned units in  
residential areas in Montenegro today, prompting fears that the 
army may be trying to draw NATO attacks to undermine this 
republic's pro-Western government. The republics of Serbia and the 
much smaller Montenegro together make up Yugoslavia. President Milo 
Djukanovic, an outspoken critic of Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic, has refused to go along with Milosevic's declaration of 
a state of war. NATO officials have largely spared Montenegrin 
targets as a sign of support for Djukanovic.

profit of $16 million today that beat Wall Street forecasts, helped 
by a surge of Web visitors and new deals with online businesses. 
Yahoo!, one of the few Internet companies that actually makes

``campaign-driven cold war'' with China could erase the gains that 
he claimed for his policy of engagement with Beijing. Chinese

<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Human rights watchdog Amnesty International today  
showcased an alleged victim of American police brutality in an 
effort to strengthen its campaign against abuses in the United 
States. Amnesty has mounted a high-profile campaign to get the 
53-nation U.N. Human Rights Commission to censure the Americans at 
its six-week annual session. Shirley Alejos, a U.S. citizen of 
Puerto Rican origin, recounted her ordeal at the hands of Chicago 
police in 1994. Amnesty is citing police brutality as one of the 
key human rights violations in the United States.

	Cronyism Blamed for CEO Paychecks  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Conflicts of interest are too common across  
Corporate America, the AFL-CIO complained today in a report that 
blames cronyism for helping fuel skyrocketing executive paychecks. 
In part due to spiraling stock options, the average CEO of a major 
corporation made $7.8 million, or 326 times more than the $24,000 
earned by a typical American factory worker in 1997. The report 
cited examples like Carnival Corp. CEO Micky Arison, who sits on 
the compensation committee that created his nearly $6 million pay 
package.

<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- For the first time since 1982, Cal Ripken  
missed a start because of injury today. Ripken, who left the 
Baltimore Orioles' season opener Monday in the third inning with 
stiffness in his lower back, began Wednesday's game against Tampa 
Bay in the dugout while Willis Otanez took over at third base. The 
last time Ripken missed a game because of injury was in May 1982 
after he got beaned. His record consecutive-game streak of 2,632 
began later that month and ended last Sept. 20.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Celtic Great Reflects on Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Coaches are too controlling, the struggling Boston  
Celtics need patience and he stops watching NBA games on television 
only to switch to ``Jeopardy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Bill Russell says he does pretty well at that, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Thirty years after he retired with his 11th title in 13 seasons  
with the Celtics and 25 years after he was elected to the Hall of 
Fame, Russell returned to the parquet floor full of opinions 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The floor, though, is in the FleetCenter that stands adjacent to  
the site of the Boston Garden, where Russell played. 
</P>
<P>
	``The old Garden was really a dump,'' he said with his  
characteristic cackle. ``This new building is quite sterile, but 
then the Garden did have character, and rats. But this is a nice 
building.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russell returned for the official announcement of a May 26  
ceremony in which his No. 6 jersey will be officially re-retired. 
</P>
<P>
	It originally was retired privately the morning of March 12,  
1972 before a Sunday game in which Russell was a color commentator. 
He and current Celtics vice chairman Red Auerbach simply pulled on 
the ropes that raised the banner with his number to the rafters. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the way Russell wanted it.  
</P>
<P>
	``I still don't particularly like awards and things because I  
always felt I was just doing what I was supposed to do,'' he said. 
``I had the same reaction when they wanted to put me in the Hall of 
Fame. I just never liked that kind of thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The May 26 ceremony should draw a sellout crowd with proceeds  
going to The National Mentoring Partnership and the Mass Mentoring 
Partnership, a state organization. Bill Cosby is scheduled to play 
host to The Bill Russell Tribute and the guest lineup includes 
Julius Erving, Wilt Chamberlain, Hank Aaron, Aretha Franklin, Tom 
Brokaw, NBA commissioner David Stern, Celtics coach Rick Pitino and 
Auerbach. 
</P>
<P>
	The playoffs will still be going on by then, almost certainly  
without the Celtics. They entered Wednesday night's game against 
Washington with a 10-22 record and end their regular season May 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell, who lives on the West Coast, said he watches his former  
team about twice a week and usually sees three games a day on 
television, starting at 4:30 p.m. with East Coast contests. He 
takes a break to see ``Jeopardy'' and wraps up his evening with 
``Star Trek.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Celtics?  
</P>
<P>
	``Their best friend is patience, but right now everybody's  
taking a shot at patience,'' he said. The proof that patience pays 
off is the Chicago Bulls' string of championships with Michael 
Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had to learn to play together because Michael's first  
five or six years, they couldn't get past the first round,'' 
Russell said, ``but they kept their team together and they learned 
to play together and they got to be a pretty good team, a little 
better than average.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pitino does the teaching on the Celtics, often shouting  
directions from the sidelines. He's not the only NBA coach doing 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I have a complaint, which I don't usually have because I  
like the game, I think the coaches are in charge and so there is no 
creativity among the players, not very much anyway,'' Russell said. 
``I like to see creativity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With teams playing illegal defenses, he said, the game ``is a  
little dull sometimes. ... Those are coaching things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russell coached Boston during his last two years as a player  
when he succeeded Auerbach. He originally told Auerbach he didn't 
want the job, then accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the one time I could make sure that I have a coach I  
like as much as I like you,'' he told Auerbach, recalling the 
moment with a hearty laugh, ``maybe more.''

<HEADLINE>  Williams Impresses NFL Types </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- There was less of Ricky Williams on display  
during his personal workout for NFL scouts, which was a good thing 
with the draft less than two weeks away. 
</P>
<P>
	The running back was fast and 20 pounds trimmer than in  
mid-February, when he showed up at the NFL scouting combine 
weighing 244 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We liked it,'' said coach Chris Palmer of the Cleveland  
Browns, who hold the first pick in the draft April 17-18. ``What he 
did today was allow a lot of scouts, general managers and head 
coaches to rest easy tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That said, Browns officials don't have a clear-cut choice in  
mind. They are considering Kentucky quarterback Tim Couch, Oregon 
quarterback Akili Smith and Williams. The Browns are scheduled to 
work out Couch in Lexington, Ky., on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, the Heisman Trophy winner from Texas, went though a  
2-hour workout Tuesday at UC San Diego for scouts, coaches and 
general managers. With his dreadlocks tied back in two pigtails, he 
ran three 40-yard dashes, did some agility drills and pass-catching 
drills. 
</P>
<P>
	The proceedings then moved inside, and, with dozens of students  
looking on, Williams bench-pressed 225 pounds 22 times. 
</P>
<P>
	The big moment came when he weighed in at 224 pounds.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just worked really hard,'' said Williams, who went to high  
school in San Diego. ``We had to concentrate so much on losing the 
weight that maybe it took away from speed work, but I mean, I think 
the main thing was getting my weight down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, the NCAA career rushing leader with 6,279 yards, also  
made an impression with coach Andy Reid of the Philadelphia Eagles, 
who have the second pick in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``The No. 1 thing was that he has dropped the weight,'' Reid  
said. ``That's always a concern, somebody's up 20 pounds from a 
normal playing weight. You've just got to (come and) see. We 
understood that he had been on the banquet circuit. But he lost it 
and he looked sharp. That showed me a little something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Being on the rubber-chicken circuit was tough ``only because  
you're not working out,'' Williams said. ``Eating wasn't that bad, 
it's just that you're traveling so much that it's really hard to 
take time to work out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for his diet, ``I just kind of made up stuff,'' Williams  
said. ``I got by. It changed almost every day. I had to work 
extremely hard. It wasn't just strictly diet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hardest thing he gave up?  
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, all sweets. Doughnuts, cheesecake. That's about it. Just  
sweets. Right now I'm going to a doughnut shop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer said Williams was timed anywhere from 4.6 seconds to 4.72  
running against the wind in the 40, and anywhere from 4.43 to 4.52 
in two heats with the wind. Two other college players who were 
being timed, including Smith's cousin, Marquis, suffered hamstring 
injuries on the cold, blustery day. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those in the crowd of 200 watching the workout were  
Cleveland general manager Dwight Clark; Indianapolis GM Bill Polian 
and coach Jim Mora; New Orleans Saints GM Bill Kuharich; and 
Minnesota Vikings coach Dennis Green. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams is so highly regarded that Saints coach Mike Ditka said  
he would trade all six 1999 draft picks and additional future picks 
to move up in the first round and get him. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuharich said the Saints haven't had any discussions yet with  
other teams, ``but that will be part of the package.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams would like to go to Cleveland as the first pick.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great organization,'' he said. ``They have the best  
fans in the NFL. I just see myself fitting in in Cleveland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams and his agent, Leland Hardy, are scheduled to visit six  
teams in three days -- St. Louis and New Orleans today, Washington 
and Philadelphia on Thursday and Cleveland and Indianapolis on 
Friday.

<HEADLINE> Naval Academy Enforces Sex Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- Birk Billingsley fell in love last fall.  
He said his romantic relationship with an underclassman was 
intimate, but didn't include sex. 
</P>
<P>
	It was still too much for the Navy.  
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the 22-year-old senior walked out the gates of the  
U.S. Naval Academy, expelled a few weeks shy of graduation for 
having an inappropriate relationship with a member of his squad. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made a mistake. There's really no excuse for my actions -- I  
fell in love,'' Billingsley said. ``I really don't think what I did 
warrants my expulsion from the academy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is just one of several midshipmen disciplined recently for  
sexual misconduct at the Academy, where officials still struggle to 
regulate the urges of college-age men and women after 22 years of 
coeducational classes. 
</P>
<P>
	Four students were expelled this year for sexual misconduct or  
fraternization, pending the Navy's final ruling. Five were expelled 
last year, The (Baltimore) Sun reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice Adm. John Ryan, has reminded midshipmen that he won't  
tolerate fraternization. But academy officials know they're 
restricting activities that, on any other campus, are commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the rules -- no sex with a freshman, no sex on campus --  
midshipmen regularly fall in love, have sex and sometimes get 
caught. Billingsley's expulsion is an example of how difficult the 
rules are to enforce. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Navy quarterback Chris McCoy was accused of having  
sex off campus with a freshman who allegedly had sex with two other 
midshipmen on campus. She was expelled. He wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
	Some midshipmen have had sex with freshmen off campus without  
being expelled, while others who have merely kissed on campus have 
been told to leave. Some who have been expelled say the system 
seems unfair. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no formula or template used to determine outcomes and  
it is wrong to assume that every case should be treated 
identically,'' said Cmdr. Mike Brady, a spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Billingsley's expulsion means the Dublin, Texas, student is  
responsible for paying the $93,000 cost of his education. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Billingsley is reluctantly applying to Stanford, Georgia  
Tech and Purdue universities to finish his aerospace engineering 
degree. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been the most humiliating and excruciating experience  
of my entire life,'' he said. ``To come this far, it's just really 
difficult.''

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Questions `Melissa' Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The lawyer for the man accused of creating  
the Melissa computer virus said he questions whether there was a 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Melissa virus does not corrupt any file, does not erase  
any files, does not delete any files,'' Edward F. Borden Jr. said 
Tuesday. ``All it does is forward a relatively innocuous message to 
50 other people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Borden wouldn't say whether his client, David Smith, was  
responsible for creating the virus. Smith's previous lawyer, Steven 
Altman, said over the weekend that Smith never intended to do 
anything wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, 30, was arrested last week and charged with originating  
the virus, which came disguised as an e-mail marked ``important 
message'' from a friend or colleague. It caused affected computers 
to fire off 50 more infected messages and slowed some systems to a 
crawl. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who is scheduled to appear in court Thursday, is charged  
with interruption of public communications, conspiracy and theft of 
computer service. He could face up to 40 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	He is free on $100,000 bail.

<HEADLINE> Mold Delays Senate Day Care Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Constructing a new day care center for  
children of Senate employees, officials discovered a potentially 
deadly mold eating through the walls. A year later, the children 
still haven't moved in, frustrated parents have hired their own 
safety consultant and the Capitol architect is just now deciding 
how to solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The stachybotrys mold, discovered during construction in March  
1998, is especially dangerous to infants, and adding infant care is 
one of the changes planned for the new and expanded Senate day care 
center. 
</P>
<P>
	The slimy black mold, still growing in the unfinished building,  
is another headache for the embattled architect's office, which 
maintains congressional grounds and buildings. In the past year, 
the office also has endured criticism as it struggled to bring the 
Capitol in compliance with workplace safety rules imposed elsewhere 
in America and floundered in attempts to revive a moribund waste 
recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman acknowledges the architect's office has moved  
cautiously in the day care matter, but says it is now ready with a 
plan to eradicate the stachybotrys mold -- a suspect in the deaths 
of at least 12 infants in Cleveland in the past six years and 140 
illnesses nationally. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents remain skeptical.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've had concerns over the length of time it has taken to get  
things moving,'' said Lisa Tuite, who is president of the day care 
center's board of directors, made up of parents. ``How long does it 
take to come up with a remediation plan? We wish we were higher on 
the priority list.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not clear why the mold, which typically grows on  
water-soaked ceilings and walls, appeared in the building. Ms. 
Tuite, a Senate employee, blames both the architect's office and 
the contractor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The contractor didn't do well enough to keep water out of the  
building, and the architect's office was not monitoring the problem 
while it got as big as it did,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents were first tipped off about the mold through an  
unofficial phone call from someone in the architect's office to a 
board member. 
</P>
<P>
	Herb Franklin, spokesman for the architect's office, said that  
officials there decided when the mold was discovered to quickly 
notify the parents. If there was a delay, he said, ``we're talking 
about a half a day or a day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We had several meetings with the parents' board,'' he said.  
``We decided they would become our partners to make sure a 
remediation plan was acceptable to them and to us. We want to make 
sure that no one has the slightest hesitancy to occupy the 
building,'' which is now due to open in September, a year behind 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Senate employees' children remain in their  
existing center in another building. No senators' children are 
currently in the program. 
</P>
<P>
	Franklin said the parents' consultant and the U.S. occupational  
safety agency, which has been consulted, have agreed the 
architect's plans for ridding the building of the mold appear to be 
sound. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dr. Dorr G. Dearborn of Cleveland, a professor of pediatrics  
at Case Western Reserve Medical School who has researched 
stachybotrys, said the mold is ``going to be very difficult to 
totally eradicate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Taking things down to a practically safe level is a reasonable  
possibility, but it's difficult to know what that level is,'' he 
said. ``We don't know what level of exposure causes the disease.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Angel Campbell, a Senate employee and the board member currently  
dealing with the problem, said, ``Having our own consultant is our 
way of assuring parents of children they don't have anything to 
worry about in terms of health and safety risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former board member who got the tip about the mold said the  
architect's office initially told her the problem might be solved 
with a simple cleaning with bleach, but officials settled on a more 
thorough approach when parents demanded assurances the mold would 
be removed in its entirety. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan now includes replacing wallboard and duct work and  
testing for water leaks. 
</P>
<P>
	A primary contractor on the building, Alberto Gomez of Prince  
Construction Co., said he still believes the stachybotrys could 
just be ``washed out with Clorox. It doesn't take rocket science to 
get rid of it.''

	BOSTON (AP) -- Six runners have joined the elite field of  
athletes set to compete in the 103rd Boston Marathon, and two 
runners withdrew, marathon officials announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the women's side, running the race will be Anuta Catuna of  
Romania, who finished third in the 1998 Boston Marathon in 2 hours, 
27 minutes, 34 seconds, and Martha Tenorio of Ecuador, who finished 
seventh in 1994 in 2:30:12. 
</P>
<P>
	On the men's side, Jose Garcia of Spain, Isaac Garcia of Mexico,  
Maskaki Oya of Japan and Silvio Guerra of Ecuador will debut in the 
race April 19. 
</P>
<P>
	The six runners join an already strong field which includes  
Moses Tanui of Kenya, who won last year's Boston Marathon with a 
strong finishing kick, and Fatuma Roba of Ethiopia, who won the 
women's race by a wide margin. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Tanui and Roba have won two previous Boston Marathons and  
last year's winning times were the third best for men and women in 
the 102 runnings of the race.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Plant Workers Reassigned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMARILLO, Texas (AP) -- Three technicians at the Pantex nuclear  
weapons plant were reassigned because of a safety mistake that 
created a danger of a non-nuclear explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no threat of a nuclear blast, a spokesman said today.  
</P>
<P>
	The technicians failed to detach a weapons component from a  
missile warhead before running an electrical test on the part on 
March 29, according to government and contractor reports. The 
component was connected to a W-87 warhead, which is used in the MX 
or Peacekeeper intercontinental ballistic missile system. 
</P>
<P>
	The technicians quickly realized the mistake after taking a test  
reading and disconnected a battery-powered tester from the weapon, 
and there was no damage. 
</P>
<P>
	A Pantex spokesman said today the mistake could not have led to  
a nuclear detonation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely, unequivocally, positively not,'' Perry Hoag said.  
</P>
<P>
	However, there is always a concern that the high explosives  
packed around the nuclear core of the weapon could cause a 
conventional explosion, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even that would not cause the nuclear warhead to explode, Hoag  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without the codes and all of the steps that go into creating a  
nuclear explosion, we couldn't make that happen even if we tried,'' 
Hoag said. 
</P>
<P>
	A conventional explosion could cause some radiation to leak from  
the nuclear core, but disassembly and testing is conducted inside a 
facility designed to contain a leak, he said. Pantex has never had 
an explosion during testing since beginning operations in 1951, 
Hoag said. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident is being reviewed by the Defense Nuclear Facilities  
Safety Board, which oversees U.S. defense nuclear facilities, said 
board member A.J. Eggenberger.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department warned nine top Serb  
military officers in Kosovo today that they could be charged with 
war crimes and crimes against humanity being commited under their 
commands. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James P. Rubin read the names of nine  
commanders U.S. officials believe are in charge of operations that 
have pushed more than 400,000 ethnic Albanians out of Kosovo since 
NATO bombing of Yugoslavia began two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The fact that they may have been under orders from Yugoslav  
President Slobodan Milosevic, who has also been targeted by U.S. 
officials for possible prosecution, would not leave them immune 
from individual prosecution, Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>

relieve that person of the individual criminal liability,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Virgin Islands Cannot Pay Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) -- The government  
announced Tuesday that cannot pay any of its 10,000 workers this 
week, marking a long-running financial crisis on this U.S. 
territory in the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Charles Turnbull, a Democrat, inherited a debt of more than  
$1 billion when he took over the government in January from 
Republican Roy Schneider. 
</P>
<P>
	After meeting with financial advisers and sympathetic labor  
leaders, Turnbull told a news conference Tuesday that there was 
only $2 million in the government account in March. 
</P>
<P>
	``After a long discussion with advisers, we determined that the  
wise course of action is to delay pay roll until early next week,'' 
he said of the twice-monthly payment due Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would ask legislators Thursday to approve short-term  
borrowing to finance the pay checks. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a time for panic,'' Turnbull appealed. ``We Virgin  
Islanders are a strong and resolute people. We've been through 
hurricanes in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government employs about one-third of the islands' work  
force and has long been accused of overstaffing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Virgin Islands has a vibrant economy built on tourism and  
light manufacturing but its public finances have been marked for 
years by budget shortfalls and irregularities. Two major hurricanes 
in 1989 and 1995 worsened the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Turnbull's announcement comes as his government considers a  
bailout deal from controversial businessman Jeffrey Prosser. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosser proposes to give land to government workers in lieu of  
about $180 million they are owed in unpaid wages, and to build 
community projects he values at $7.8 million on each of the three 
islands of the U.S. territory. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, he wants tax breaks worth about $180 million over 30  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say it is just such tax breaks that have helped bankrupt  
the government.

<P>
	PASSAIC, N.J. (AP) -- Two women were charged with keeping their  
25-year-old learning-disabled roommate handcuffed to a bathroom 
door and torturing her with belts and pipes. 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Gutschmidt told investigators the handcuffing lasted for  
weeks and she was released only twice a day to eat. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she had been burned with hot spoons, beaten with a  
wooden chair leg, a piece of metal pipe, an umbrella and a leather 
belt with a buckle, according to the police report. 
</P>
<P>
	Lisa Geer and Mimi Veale, both 25, were arrested Monday and  
remain in jail in lieu of $100,000 bond each. They face charges of 
kidnapping, assault, weapons possession and making terrorist 
threats. 
</P>
<P>
	Geer also faces theft charges for allegedly stealing $652 from  
Gutschmidt. 
</P>
<P>
	Gutschmidt told police the women had threatened to chop up her  
body and bury her. She said her roommates had started abusing her 
in March because she would lose or break things in the home. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities would not comment on the extent of Gutschmidt's  
learning disability. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged abuse was discovered by Geer's mother, who saw the  
bruised woman at Geer's birthday party last weekend and took her to 
police.

	PORT HURON, Mich. (AP) -- A mayor who used his struggle with drug

around was charged Wednesday with taking pornographic photos of 
young girls.

taken between August of last year and March, Moeller said. 
</P>
<P>
	The typically flamboyant and outspoken Ackerman -- known for his  
chest-length beard, ponytail and two earrings in his left ear -- 
stood silent during his arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge entered an innocent plea on Ackerman's behalf. He later  
posted $25,000 bond for his release. 
</P>
<P>
	News of Ackerman's arrest stunned this close-knit community  
about an hour north of Detroit. About 50 people packed into the 
small courtroom for the arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel he kind of let his community down,'' said Donna  
Stranyak, 36, a waitress at a local cafe. 
</P>
<P>
	Randy Arnott, 47, a laborer and longtime resident, doesn't  
believe the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just can't see him do that,'' he said. ``They don't know if  
he did it ... it could be some kind of hoax.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ackerman, honored five years ago by the National Association of  
Social Workers, became mayor of the conservative city of 37,000 
along Lake Huron in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been considered a role model for kids, motivating others  
trying to break free of their addictions. Ackerman has done various 
volunteer work and even opened his a facility, Clear Choices, where 
young people and adults can go to get off the street and talk to 
someone. 
</P>
<P>
	He goes by his nickname, after the warrior Ajax in a movie about  
street gangs, and still prefers to ride his Harley-Davidson and 
wear leather biker duds. 
</P>
<P>
	Ackerman was charged with six counts of first-degree criminal  
sexual conduct, five counts of criminal sexual conduct, two counts 
of production of child abusive material and one count of indecent 
exposure. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, he could face life in prison.

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A pair of last-minute goals left both semifinals  
of the European Champions Cup tied after Wednesday's first legs. 
</P>
<P>
	Manchester United, leading the English Premier league, managed a  
1-1 draw at home against Juventus on a goal by Ryan Giggs in injury 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	And in Kiev, Bayern Munich came away with a 3-3 draw with Dynamo  
on Carsten Janker's score in the closing seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite failing to secure a victory, the point at Old Trafford  
may have been enough to assure Juventus of a fourth consecutive 
appearance in the Champions Cup final. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian champions silenced 55,000 Manchester fans when  
Antonio Conte scored in the 25th minute on a play sparked by French 
World Cup hero Zinedine Zidane. 
</P>
<P>
	Juve looked set to return home to Turin with a first-leg lead  
and set up yet another final, this time in Barcelona May 27. 
</P>
<P>
	But United hit back strongly in the late stages and Giggs scored  
the equalizer in injury time after Juve failed to clear a 
right-wing cross from David Beckham. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a similar story in Kiev.  
</P>
<P>
	Dynamo's Andrii Shevchenko, who scored three times in  
quarterfinal games against defending titlist Real Madrid, hit the 
first goal and created the second for Kakha Kaladze with his free 
kick two minutes before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	Seconds before the half, Michael Tarnat's 30-yard free kick  
bounced past Kiev goalkeeper Olexander Shovkovsky for Bayern, but 
Vitaly Kossovskyi made it 3-1 five minutes into the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	Steffan Effenberg's 78th minute free kick brought it back to 3-2  
and, in the final minute, Janker hit the Bayern equalizer from 
close range.

<HEADLINE> Social Security Penalty Under Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's a perennial political rite: Lawmakers  
demand elimination of the Social Security earnings test, a penalty 
that forces the youngest among older Americans to choose between a 
government check and work. 
</P>
<P>
	But this year, as President Clinton and Republican congressional  
leaders try to work out how to spend government surpluses, it might 
finally be wiped off the books. 
</P>
<P>
	``The line between retirement and working is blurring'' because  
Americans are living longer, said Social Security Commissioner 
Kenneth S. Apfel. ``People should be able to continue to work and 
continue to receive a Social Security benefit to keep contributing 
to the work force and to themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has said relief from the earnings test should be part of  
a larger package that would use expected government surpluses to 
help avert a Social Security cash shortfall expected in 2034. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if they reach no overall deal on Social Security, however,  
relief from the earnings test is a tempting political plum that 
affects the nation's most avid voters -- senior citizens. 
Republicans used a proposal to ease its impact in the ``Contract 
With America'' that helped them win control of Congress in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., is making eliminating  
the penalty a priority, and some say a repeal could find its way 
into a tax relief package Democrats would also be eager to support 
before the 2000 election. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we will get something passed this year on this issue,  
whether it is a stand-alone or as part of overall reform,'' said 
Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Available surpluses could help grease the skids: the cost to  
Social Security of eliminating the earnings test is expected to be 
negligible in the long run, but because it would mean some people 
would collect benefits earlier, it could cost as much as $15 
billion over the first five years, before diminishing. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings test currently affects 870,000 working Americans  
between the ages of 65 and 69 who earn more than Social Security 
allows and therefore get a smaller benefit or none at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Without a job, many of these older people face the prospect of  
trying to live on a fixed income near the poverty level. Yet they 
lose $1 of benefits for every $3 they earn above $15,500 a year. 
That limit is scheduled to rise to $30,000 a year by 2002 because 
of congressional action four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings test is even stricter for people who want to  
collect some benefits under an early retirement option offered to 
those age 62 to 64. They lose $1 for every $2 earned above $9,600 a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	However, most proposals to ease the penalty would not provide  
relief for these early retirees, and Clinton has not said whether 
he would support that. 
</P>
<P>
	In reality, Social Security benefits withheld under the earnings  
test are not lost -- just delayed. 
</P>
<P>
	After people retire fully -- or once they reach age 70, when the  
penalty no longer applies -- their monthly benefits are adjusted 
upward to compensate for the losses. 
</P>
<P>
	That can create a positive side effect, says former  
congressional economist Wendell Primus: People who continue working 
lock in higher Social Security benefits for later, when they or a 
surviving spouse will need them most. 
</P>
<P>
	But the main reasoning behind the earnings test dates back to  
Social Security's start during the Great Depression, Primus said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You had high unemployment,'' said Primus. ``They wanted some  
of these older workers to leave the work force to make room, so you 
couldn't get Social Security if you were working.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today, discouraging older people from working is no longer  
desirable. Unlike in the 1930s, unemployment today is low and 
businesses will have to cope with a dwindling work force as the 
huge baby boom generation nears the traditional retirement age. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're finally waking up to the fact that we've got this aging  
population and we need to find ways to keep people in the work 
force,'' said Andrea Wooten, president of Green Thumb Inc., a 
nonprofit organization that helps people over age 55 find and keep 
meaningful work. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, many people feel punished by the earnings test. Not  
everyone lives long enough to collect the system's delayed 
compensation. And wealthier retirees who collect income from 
investments rather than work aren't affected.

<HEADLINE> Della Reese Helps CBS Win the Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The next time actress Della Reese seeks a raise  
from CBS, she may want to keep a copy of last week's Nielsen Media 
Research ratings for ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Secret Path,'' a CBS Sunday night movie that starred Reese  
and Ossie Davis, was the second most-watched show of the week, 
Nielsen said Tuesday. Tied for third place was ``Touched By an 
Angel,'' also starring Reese. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS, involved in a tight race with NBC for season dominance, had  
a 9.0 rating and 16 share to win the week. NBC was second with an 
8.4 rating and 15 share, though it led among 18- to 49-year-olds, 
the audience advertisers covet. ABC had a 7.1 rating and 12 share 
and Fox had a 5.5 rating and 9 share. 
</P>
<P>
	The men's NCAA basketball championship game between Connecticut  
and Duke was the week's most-watched program. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a lackluster week, ABC was pleased that its two newest  
comedies, ``The Norm Show'' and ``It's Like, You Know,'' managed 
the unusual feat of getting higher ratings during their second 
showings than on their premieres a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox's new comedy, ``Futurama,'' also did well, though it dropped  
off from its premiere. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton's first major television interview since his  
impeachment trial, with Dan Rather on ``60 Minutes II,'' had an 
average audience of 12 million people. That was approximately one 
quarter the audience for Monica Lewinsky's interview with Barbara 
Walters nearly a month earlier. However, CBS had less than 24 hours 
notice that Clinton would give the interview, so there was little 
time to promote it, and most of the talk was about matters other 
than the sex scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the emerging networks, the WB had a 2.7 rating and 5  
share, UPN had a 1.9 rating and 3 share and Pax TV had a 0.8 rating 
and 1 share. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' eked out a victory in the evening news  
race with an 8.1 rating and 17 share. ABC's ``World News Tonight'' 
had an 8.0 rating and 17 share and the ``CBS Evening News'' was at 
6.8 and 15. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of March 29-April 4, the top 10 shows, their  
networks and ratings were the ``NCAA Basketball Championship: 
Connecticut vs. Duke,'' CBS, 17.2; ``CBS Sunday Movie: The Secret 
Path,'' CBS, 14.7; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 12.6; ``Friends,'' NBC, 12.6; 
``Touched By an Angel,'' CBS, 12.6, ``Jesse,'' NBC, 12.0; ``ER,'' 
NBC, 11.8; ``The Drew Carey Show,'' ABC, 11.6; ``Dateline 
NBC-Tuesday,'' NBC, 11.4; ``Prelude to a Championship,'' CBS, 11.2; 
''Veronica's Closet,'' NBC, 11.2.

<HEADLINE> Yahoo! Reports $16M Quarter Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Yahoo! Inc., the second-most popular  
Internet destination, reported a sharply higher first-quarter 
profit of $16 million Wednesday that beat Wall Street forecasts, 
helped by a surge of Web visitors and new deals with online 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo!, one of the few Internet companies that actually makes  
money, said its profit came to 7 cents a share in the three months 
ended March 31. That was up from a profit of $3.3 million, or 2 
cents a share, in the first quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding one-time charges, the Santa Clara, Calif-.based  
company would have earned $25.1 million, or 11 cents a share, in 
the recent quarter. Analysts surveyed by First Call had predicted 
earnings of 8 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterly revenues nearly tripled to $86.1 million from $30.6  
million as the number of visitors to its Web sites grew 5.4 percent 
in February alone. Yahoo! struck numerous new deals with online 
businesses, including retailers who paid for links on Yahoo!'s Web 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! said it is well positioned for further growth with its  
recent purchase of broadcast.com, the top provider of TV and radio 
programming on the Web, and its purchase of GeoCities, which hosts 
Web pages created by individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect both of these acquisitions, which are not reflected  
in our first quarter results, to add substantially to the breadth 
of services we offer our global users, and advertising, merchant 
and business partners,'' said Yahoo! chief executive Tim Koogle. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Balderston, an industry analyst with Redwood City-based Zona  
Research, said that big Internet companies like Yahoo! -- which has 
a market value of nearly $42 billion -- will have to begin 
generating bigger revenue if they are to maintain an investor 
enthusiasm that's pushed the Dow over 10,000 and made such 
businesses worth much more than they are actually producing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now Yahoo! and a lot of the Internet stocks still enjoy  
valuation based on infinite possibilities,'' Balderston said. ``At 
some point those are going to have to become probabilities and 
plausibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was released Wednesday after the close of financial  
markets, where shares fell 3 percent, or $6.43 3/4 at $208.43 3/4 on the 
Nasdaq Stock Market. But in after-hours trading, Yahoo! shares rose 
$3.87 1/2 to $212.50, according to Instinet. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo!, whose sites include a range of features from chat rooms  
to news and search services, announced a deal Monday to deliver its 
content and services to hand-held computers and devices for viewing 
the Web on TV. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal with Online Anywhere, Yahoo! will provide e-mail,  
personal calendars, weather and stock quotes. Online Anywhere's 
technology automatically formats the information to fit whatever 
device the subscriber is using, be it a large-screen television or 
a pocket-size, hand-held computer.

<HEADLINE> Spyglass To Work With Microsoft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAPERVILLE, Ill. (AP) -- Spyglass Inc. will license technology to  
Microsoft Corp. and work with the company to help accelerate the 
development of Windows CE-based products, Spyglass announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the strategic agreement, Microsoft will pay Spyglass  
$20 million over three years, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spyglass will help Internet device manufacturers develop and  
integrate Windows CE-based applications into their products. The 
products include screen telephones, medical instruments and devices 
in automobiles, said Doug Colbeth, president and chief executive 
officer of Spyglass. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft also is licensing Spyglass technology to explore ways  
to enhance the Windows CE experience, Spyglass said. Windows CE is 
operating system software used for devices that don't require a 
full-featured operating system like Windows 98. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft has used Spyglass' technology before. In 1995, it  
licensed Spyglass' Mosaic software code for its Internet Explorer 
browser.

<HEADLINE> Charges Dropped Vs. NYC Protesters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Prosecutors dropped charges Wednesday against  
the 1,166 celebrities, politicians and other people arrested during 
15 days of protests over the police slaying of an unarmed West 
African immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Raymond Castello said the protesters were  
sufficiently punished when they were held for several hours after 
their arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	Amadou Diallo, a street vendor from Guinea, was killed Feb. 4  
outside his Bronx apartment when four white officers looking for a 
rapist fired 41 shots. The officers were charged last week with 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
	The slaying led to allegations of police brutality and racism.  
</P>
<P>
	Among those arrested during the demonstrations outside police  
headquarters were the Rev. Jesse Jackson, former Mayor David 
Dinkins, NAACP President Kweisi Mfume, and actors Ossie Davis, Ruby 
Dee and Susan Sarandon. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, a judge dismissed the trespassing and  
disorderly-conduct charges at the request of District Attorney 
Robert Morgenthau. Although the protesters blocked building 
entrances, prosecutors said they were nonviolent and cooperated 
with police. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have the utmost respect for District Attorney Morgenthau,  
and in most instances, I agree with him,'' Police Commissioner 
Howard Safir said. ``This time, however, I do not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, Safir said police had caught the rapist the four  
officers were searching for when Diallo was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect, Issaac Jones, 38, lives less than a mile from  
Diallo's apartment. Safir said Jones is believed to have raped 51 
women since 1993.

<HEADLINE> Intel Pushing for Home Networking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Computer chip giant Intel Corp., is marketing a  
new gadget that easily allows consumers to create their own home 
computer network. 
</P>
<P>
	The $190 AnyPoint Home Network lets users of different machines  
share files, use the same printer and access the Internet through 
one account over existing phone lines. It plugs into the outside of 
the computer, easier to install than other products that require 
consumers to open up their machines. 
</P>
<P>
	While a handful of manufacturers already sell such equipment at  
CompUSA and other computer stores, the marketing push launched 
Tuesday by the world's largest maker of computer microprocessors 
could lure mainstream consumers to the product, some analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their marketing might and support of this will help drive the  
customer to look for it and consider it,'' said Aaron Goldberg of 
ZD Market Intelligence, a high-tech research firm. ``The big thing 
is to get the customers over the hurdle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, only a small fraction of U.S. households link their  
computers into networks. But that should rise as consumers buy more 
than one PC -- up from 12.4 percent of homes at the end of last year 
to an estimated 17 percent by the end of 1999, according to the 
Yankee Group research firm. Also driving the trend is a rapid 
growth in high-speed Internet access, through phone and cable-TV 
lines, which encourages people to link their computers into 
networks. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to CompUSA, Intel's product will be offered by  
computer makers Gateway and IBM. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel's initiative is part of a company drive to stimulate new  
uses for computers, key to generating demand for its more powerful 
microprocessors. The urgency for Intel has intensified amid a sharp 
drop in computer prices that threatens to shift Intel's sales to 
its least profitable chips. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel chairman Andy Grove said the idea is to encourage  
consumers to buy a more powerful computer as the ``base station'' 
for their home, able to run more demanding applications and easily 
communicate with less powerful machines in other rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	But consumers may balk at paying a higher price for the  
convenience of easy installation, some say. The AnyPoint product is 
nearly twice as expensive than some other offerings that also work 
through phone lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty cheap to network your home if you know what you're  
doing,'' said David Goldstein, president of Channel Marketing 
Corp., a research and consultant firm.

<HEADLINE> Former IBM Executive Indicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- A former IBM manager and other company  
executives accepted bribes so a customer could fraudulently obtain 
more than $20 million worth of computers and parts, an indictment 
returned Wednesday alleged. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment alleged that Robert St. Germain, who managed  
IBM's Reutilization Department from 1990 to July 1993, joined in 
the scheme with Lawrence Laspina, whose companies bought IBM 
computers and parts. 
</P>
<P>
	It said Laspina paid about $575,000 in cash bribes to St.  
Germain and other IBM executives to allow him to sell surplus IBM 
computers, which he was supposed to dismantle. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Germain, 55, of Verbank and Laspina, 41, of Fort Lauderdale,  
Fla., were charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, the 
transport of $20 million in computers obtained by fraud and tax 
fraud for concealing the payment of bribes and over $1.5 million 
earned through sale of the computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Laspina also was charged with obstruction of justice for  
allegedly causing the destruction and concealment of documents 
sought by a grand jury in federal court in White Plains, where the 
indictment was returned.

<TEXT>
<P>
	AMES, Iowa (AP) -- Shares of Engineering Animation Inc. plunged  
45.7 percent Wednesday after the company projected 
lower-than-expected profits and revenue for the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The producer of software for three-dimensional designing and  
animation for businesses such as Ford Motor Co. and Lockheed Martin 
Corp. cited a failure to close a half dozen contracts for the poor 
results. 
</P>
<P>
	Its stock fell $18.25 in heavy trading to close at a 52-week low  
of $21.68 3/4 a share Wednesday on the Nasdaq Stock Market following 
the earnings warning Tuesday evening and an apologetic conference 
call Wednesday with analysts, investors and reporters. Engineering 
Animation traded as high as $72 a share last July. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said first-quarter revenue will be about 15 percent  
below analysts' estimates, ranging from $29 million to $31 million, 
and that profit will be below the 26 cents a share that analysts 
had been estimating.

executive, said that up until now, the Ames-based business had 
exceeded earnings and revenue estimates for each of the 12 quarters 
since it first sold stock to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm more than disappointed -- I'm personally embarrassed,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rizai said the shortfall was not the result of increased  
competition or concerns among software buyers about the Year 2000 
computer flaw. 
</P>
<P>
	``EAI's growth and earnings potential remain strong,'' he said.  
``We have the best technology in the industry, a unique set of 
business solutions for manufacturing companies and a strong and 
growing customer base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	EAI's first-quarter earnings will be announced later this month.  
In the first quarter of 1998, it posted a loss of $448,000, or 5 
cents a share, on revenue of $15.8 million.

<HEADLINE> Couple Sues Over Misplaced Embryos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A white couple have filed a malpractice lawsuit  
against the doctors they say were responsible for an embryo mix-up 
that resulted in the wife giving birth to a black baby when she 
delivered twins. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard and Donna Fasano, who gave birth to their own white baby  
at the same time, allege that Dr. Lillian Nash was negligent when 
she implanted the embryo of a black New Jersey couple into Mrs. 
Fasano. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fasanos charge in papers filed Monday in Manhattan State  
Supreme Court that ``negligence, carelessness and malpractice of 
the defendants'' caused the transfer of the wrong embryo into Mrs. 
Fasano. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Court papers also charge that Nash violated confidentiality  
rules when she divulged their names to the black couple, Robert 
Rogers and Deborah Perry-Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
	A person who answered the telephone at Nash's office on Tuesday  
said she would have no comment on the case. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Nash, the lawsuit names Dr. Dov B. Goldstein and  
two of his businesses -- the Brooklyn Fertility Center and Central 
Park Medical Services, and a Dr. ``John'' Obasaju, who is believed 
to be an embryologist. 
</P>
<P>
	The mix-up happened on April 24, when the women were in Nash's  
offices for embryo implantation after in vitro fertilization of 
their eggs. Several of Mrs. Perry-Rogers' fertilized eggs were 
erroneously implanted in Mrs. Fasano. 
</P>
<P>
	Court papers said Nash informed both couples of the mistake  
months before Mrs. Fasano gave birth. The Fasanos did not know who 
the Rogerses were until the Rogerses filed a lawsuit against them 
last month seeking custody of the black baby boy and also sued Nash 
and two other doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fasanos have said they will raise their biological child and  
that if DNA tests show that the Rogerses are the other baby's 
genetic parents, they will relinquish custody of the child to them.

<HEADLINE>  Airstrikes Said Rattling Milosevic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two weeks of NATO airstrikes have ``rattled''  
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and hurt morale among his 
armed forces, which are struggling with fuel and ammunition 
shortages and bombed out command centers, Pentagon officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Serb air defenses remain a threat to NATO aircraft, however, and  
widely scattered tanks and troops accused of leading an ethnic 
cleansing campaign against ethic Albanians in Kosovo are still 
proving difficult to strike despite a stepped up allied air 
campaign that was taking advantage of clear skies today to hit more 
targets, U.S. officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have evidence of units that had to go into holding  
operations or holding patterns because of shortages of, 
specifically, gas and ammo,'' said Rear Adm. Thomas Wilson, 
director of intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He 
acknowledged few troops or tanks have been struck, mostly because 
they're hiding in mountainous terrain or are too close to innocent 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson cited ``anecdotal reports that morale is declining'' in  
the Serb military following this past week's most devastating U.S. 
cruise missile and bomb strikes on army and police headquarters, 
command centers and fuel and ammunition depots throughout 
Yugoslavia and an intelligence training facility outside Belgrade. 
Wilson didn't offer any estimates of Serb military casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	In a sign that Milosevic is feeling the effects of NATO  
airstrikes that began March 24, he announced a unilateral 
cease-fire Tuesday and offered to allow ethnic Albanians back into 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	After pushing about half the 2 million Kosovo population out of  
the Serbian province since February 1998 -- more than 400,000 ethnic 
Albanians in the past two weeks -- Milosevic may feel he has changed 
the situation on the ground to his advantage. Previously, Kosovo 
was about 10 percent Serbian. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Clinton administration and other NATO nations quickly  
rejected the cease-fire offer, calling it a sham and insisting that 
Milosevic pull back his forces, allow refugees to return home under 
NATO protection and accept a peace plan giving ethnic Albanians 
self-rule. 
</P>
<P>
	``This offer may be one sign that he is rattled,'' Pentagon  
spokesman Kenneth Bacon said. ``But we are going to continue to 
rattle him until he makes an offer that meets our conditions, and 
he's far away from that right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intensified NATO airstrikes have led to increased reports of  
civilian casualties. In the worst case so far, an allied bomb went 
astray Monday night and hit apartment buildings in the mining town 
of Aleksinac, about 100 miles south of Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	Serb television reported at least 12 civilians killed. The  
Pentagon said a laser-guided bomb from a U.S. plane ``fell short'' 
of its target, a nearby military post housing a Serb artillery 
brigade, possibly because cloud cover interfered with the guidance 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will work hard to hold civilian casualties to a minimum,''  
Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has agreed to house as many as 20,000 ethnic  
Albanian refugees temporarily at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo 
Bay, Cuba, to ease the Balkan refugee crisis. Other Europeans 
countries are taking in some 100,000 -- but only until they can 
return to Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen was visiting NATO headquarters  
in Brussels, Belgium, today to consult with authorities there on 
the latest Kosovo developments. He was accompanied by members of 
Congress, including Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Carl Levin, 
D-Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and NATO foreign ministers  
will meet in Brussels early next week to assess the offensive 
against the Serbs and reaffirm their determination to forge a 
settlement for Kosovo, State Department spokesman James Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	This may be followed by a meeting either of the six Contact  
Group nations -- Russia, the United States, France, Italy, Germany 
and Britain -- that framed a proposed political settlement for 
Kosovo that was rejected by Milosevic, or of the G-8 nations, which 
would also include Russia, Canada and Japan, a senior U.S. official 
told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia supports restoring autonomy to the ethnic Albanians in  
Kosovo that Milosevic stripped away in 1989, but has deplored the 
NATO airstrikes and suspended cooperation with the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to mend fences Tuesday, Vice President Al Gore telephoned  
Russian Prime Minister Yvgeny Primakov. It was first time the two 
had spoken since Primakov turned his plane around last month en 
route to Washington to protest the start of the air campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore told reporters on Air Force Two on a trip to California  
that he spoke with Primakov for about an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are trying to limit damage to the U.S.-Russian  
relationship,'' Gore said. ``He and I have a very good personal 
relationship. The call was businesslike.''

<HEADLINE> Scientists Claim Alzheimer's Enzyme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	In what could be a key step in finding a treatment for  
Alzheimer's, researchers reported today that they have found an 
enzyme that activates the mind-robbing disease afflicting some 4 
million Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the researchers, Dr. Dennis Selkoe, a neurologist at  
Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, said scientists are ``very 
much on the road'' to a treatment. He said drugs designed to block 
the enzyme could enter clinical trials within three years. 
</P>
<P>
	But some scientists questioned whether the research team had  
identified the actual enzyme or one that simply works in concert 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The case is far from nailed either way,'' said John Hardy of  
the Mayo Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	Alzheimer's patients are known to have toxic plaques, or  
buildups, of amyloid beta proteins in their brains. 
</P>
<P>
	Selkoe, Michael Wolfe at the University of Tennessee and others  
found evidence suggesting that a previously known brain substance 
called presenilin is the enzyme that controls production of amyloid 
beta proteins. Scientists previously believed presenilin played a 
role in Alzheimer's. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Sam Gandy, a New York University cell biologist who works  
with amyloid proteins, said the study published in the journal 
Nature offers ``very exciting and persuasive evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he cautioned that the enzyme and the chemical on which it  
operates must be purified and allowed to interact alone to be 
certain other unseen chemicals are not involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers also warned that presenilin may regulate other  
processes, such as the immune system, meaning that Alzheimer's 
drugs designed to inhibit presenilin could carry unwanted side 
effects.

<HEADLINE> New FAA Radar Not Up To Speed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new $1 billion Federal Aviation  
Administration computer system is proving to be so slow in tests 
that it takes at least twice as long as the equipment it is 
supposed to replace. 
</P>
<P>
	Agency officials, however, say the slowness is a result of  
design changes suggested by technicians and air traffic controllers 
and are being remedied. 
</P>
<P>
	``In making all those changes there were adverse effects on  
system performance, in other words the system was slowed,'' said 
FAA spokesman William Shumann. ``We are now working to restore the 
speed of the system to its specifications.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Citing an internal report on tests conducted last month, USA  
Today reported today that the system, called ``Stars,'' was two to 
three times slower than existing equipment in displaying aircraft 
radar positions and responding to air traffic controllers' 
commands. 
</P>
<P>
	It quoted FAA officials as saying that, until fixed, the new  
system is unsuitable for use at the nation's busiest airports, 
where it is needed most. The first elements of the system were to 
be installed at Washington's Reagan National Airport by March 31, 
but the FAA announced in February it would not meet that deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	No new date has been set.  
</P>
<P>
	Peter Challan, the FAA's director of air traffic systems, told  
the newspaper the agency is working with the manufacturer, Raytheon 
Co., air traffic controllers and its own engineers to speed up the 
new computer system. Raytheon called the tests ``unofficial and 
incomplete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars system is part of a massive technological upgrade  
underway with the nation's air traffic system. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA's $1 billion contract with Raytheon calls for upgrading  
the controller work stations and supporting computers in 173 FAA 
and 199 Defense Department terminal control facilities, which 
oversee planes shortly after takeoff or on their initial approach 
to an airport. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA is also in the process of replacing the computers used  
by controllers in en route centers, which control planes between 
terminal control facilities. In addition, the agency is developing 
technology that will allow pilots to use the satellite-based Global 
Positioning System for pinpoint navigation and more precise 
landings at an increased number of airports. 
</P>
<P>
	Each process has been plagued by costly delays. The Stars  
project, for example, is expected to cost $2.2 billion.

<HEADLINE> Y2K Drill To Test Power Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Power plant operators across the  
country are holding a nationwide drill Friday to make sure they can 
keep the juice flowing if Year-2000 computer glitches prevent them 
from communicating with each other. 
</P>
<P>
	The drill is one of a series being conducted by the utility  
companies prior to Jan. 1, 2000 to test their vital systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Plant operators depend on telephone and fiber-optic lines and  
microwave transmitters to get continuous data readouts of each 
others' power generation levels, demand for electricity and other 
factors so they can send crucial kilowatts over the national power 
grid to regions that need it the most. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the drill, power plants will pretend that this data  
is unavailable, requiring them to share the information in other 
ways. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to simulate loss of communication functions, which  
is the bugaboo and something we don't have control of,'' said Gregg 
Fishman, spokesman for the Sacramento Municipal Utility District. 
``We will go to backup communications, which basically is guys out 
at the substations with handheld radios.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Communications is especially important during times of high  
demand, severe weather or if plants are disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, for instance, Florida power authorities had  
to cope with the possibility of outages due to high temperatures 
and power plants that were down for routine maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
	The test date, April 9, was chosen because it is the 99th day of  
1999, a number experts fear might read as an error message in some 
computer programs, since some programmers once typed in a series of 
9s as placeholders. While electricity companies don't believe the 
date will cause any glitches, they want to be prepared. 
</P>
<P>
	The larger problem, known sometimes as the Y2K bug, is that  
older computer programs and chips used only two digits. When 2000 
rolls around, some programs might think it is 1900, resulting in 
anything from calculation mistakes to outright failures. 
</P>
<P>
	The North American Electric Reliability Council, a nonprofit  
industry group in Princeton, N.J, was asked by the U.S. Department 
of Energy to take a leadership role in making sure electrical 
utilities are ready for the Year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	NERC reported in January that there likely will be ``only  
minimal impact'' on electricity production and distribution, since 
utilities around the country have been fixing and replacing 
affected equipment and conducting test after test. 
</P>
<P>
	The Edison Electric Institute, the Washington, D.C.-based  
organization whose members generate about three-quarters of the 
country's electricity, has said all its member utilities will 
complete their testing and repairs by June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Utilities and others involved in power transmission can design  
their own scenarios for Friday's drill, as long as they involve 
failure of current communication systems and use of backup systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is more to focus on communications within a utility,''  
says Mike Tyndall, spokesman for the Atlanta-based Southern 
Company, the largest U.S. electricity producer. 
</P>
<P>
	Power production figures from all the plants of Southern's five  
subsidiaries are usually fed electronically to the company's 
central nerve center in Birmingham, Ala., Tyndall explained. 
</P>
<P>
	For the drill, people will be standing at plants and  
substations, reading the data and calling it into the nerve center 
over wireless phones, Tyndall said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hydroelectric power plants, such as Keswick Dam on Shasta Lake  
in northern California, will use a microwave antenna as a backup 
communications system. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the scenarios we're interested in practicing for is if  
we lose telephones at the same time we're dealing with flood 
concerns,'' said Larry Ball, chief of operations and electrical 
maintenance for the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation at Keswick. 
</P>
<P>
	NERC plans to post a brief assessment of the drill results on  
its Internet site on Friday and plans a more detailed assessment in 
three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	NERC is also planning another national Year-2000 exercise for  
Sept. 9, 1999, another date that computer experts say could cause 
problems, but the nature of that exercise has not yet been 
determined. 
</P>

	``Deluxe Edition'' (Alligator Records) -- William Clarke, Katie  
Webster, Hound Dog Taylor and the Houserockers 

</P>
<P>
	With the ``Deluxe Edition'' series, Alligator Records founder  
Bruce Iglauer pays tribute to his label's artists. The latest batch 
of releases features three artists with widely varying styles that 
prove the blues are more than 12 bars and a sad lyric. Each compact 
disc contains previously unreleased material and is handsomely 
packaged with candid photos and Iglauer's liner notes. 
</P>
<P>
	Hound Dog Taylor and the Houserockers personified electric  
Chicago blues at the most ragged, no-frills level. Iglauer first 
heard the trio in 1970 and started his label to record them. Rail 
thin and armed with a high-pitched voice, cheap guitar and a slide, 
Taylor banged away at the blues with abandon in South Side clubs 
and Chicago's Maxwell Street market. 
</P>
<P>
	Alligator brought Taylor a measure of fame and international  
exposure. ``Deluxe Edition'' captures the essence of Taylor: 
intimate knowledge of the masters from Elmore James to Big Bill 
Broonzy and originals that rank as classics now (``Give Me Back My 
Wig''), all in a blast-away style that sent audiences home sweating 
before his death in the mid 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	At the other end of the spectrum stands William Clarke,  
harmonica swing master from California. The former machinist turned 
to the blues full time after 20 years on the line, though he never 
left his workingman's roots. Clarke was a fine songwriter as well 
as composer who chronicled some of life's basic issues: family, 
love, money and sex. He did it with a great sense of lyricism in 
his music and a swing that was infectious. 
</P>
<P>
	Tutored by George ``Harmonica'' Smith, Clarke learned the  
chromatic harp and took it a step further, bringing the rich sound 
to smaller harps. In his trademark dark sunglasses and goatee, 
Clark cut an imposing figure on the bandstand, though he was not 
boisterous or bantering. His music did the talking. Clarke's last 
release, 1996's ``The Hard Way,'' was an innovative step toward an 
even broader mix of jazz, swing and blues and won the W.C. Handy 
Award for best contemporary blues album. Clarke never collected the 
award. he died suddenly at 45. 
</P>
<P>
	Somewhere between Clarke and Taylor (geographically, even)  
stands Katie Webster, the ``Swamp Boogie Queen.'' The title cut of 
Webster's ``Deluxe Edition'' says it all about the Louisiana piano 
player: ``Two-Fisted Mama.'' Webster combined a soulful voice with 
a rollicking piano style to reign as Queen of the Boogie. Labelmate 
Koko Taylor gets top billing as Queen of the Blues but Webster 
could hold her own in writing, singing and playing. 
</P>
<P>
	Webster already had a successful career when she came to  
Alligator for her last three recordings, but the selection gives a 
good overview. A stroke in 1993 cut short her career, though she 
still makes occasional appearances.

<HEADLINE> It's Decision Day for Redskins Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- After months of juggling finances and weeks of  
intense lobbying, Howard Milstein put his record $800 million bid 
before NFL owners. 
</P>
<P>
	A vote of approval by the 31 owners today could leave him with  
one of the NFL's high-profile clubs. Or he could become the first 
prospective buyer rejected by the owners in a bid for an 
established franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	While it's been difficult to project the way the owners vote on  
anything from instant replay to expansion, it appeared Tuesday 
night that Milstein and partner Daniel Snyder did not have the 
support of the 24 owners needed to complete the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	WJLA-TV in Washington reported today that the Milstein-Snyder  
bid would be withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's special meeting was arranged after Milstein requested a  
postponement during last month's sessions in Phoenix. In Arizona, 
it become apparent he did not have enough votes and would need to 
spend more time lobbying individual owners. 
</P>
<P>
	One league source, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The  
Associated Press that Milstein had no more than seven to 10 votes 
in Phoenix and is still ``far short'' of the three-fourths 
required. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote could hinge on a recommendation from commissioner Paul  
Tagliabue and the league's financial committee, which will meet 
before the vote. The eight-member committee was split 3-3 with two 
abstentions in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee chairman Bob Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots,  
has been one of the bid's few solid supporters. But committee 
members Tom Benson of New Orleans and Pat Bowlen of Denver are 
adamantly opposed. 
</P>
<P>
	Some owners, such as Baltimore's Art Modell, expressed concern  
that the Redskins would be left in limbo if the bid is rejected. It 
could take several months to come up with a new prospective buyer 
if the league asks for another round of bidding, and possibly 
several years to resolve a court battle if Milstein sues. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the objections by some owners:  
</P>
<P>
	--While Milstein is worth an estimated $500 million, most of it  
is tied up in real estate, making his part of the bid heavily 
leveraged without the ready cash to back it up. His father recently 
agreed to supply $125 million to support the bid, but some league 
officials reportedly consider that money a loan that helps the 
financing arrangement only marginally. 
</P>
<P>
	--Milstein's part-ownership of the NHL's Islanders, which he  
bought with a partner just 14 months ago, has been ugly and 
litigious. Milstein wanted a new arena and threatened to cancel 
games because he felt the old one was unsafe. There are lawsuits 
pending between Milstein and New York's Nassau County. 
</P>
<P>
	--Milstein, according to several sources, solicited politicians  
in the nation's capital to lobby owners on his behalf. Sources say 
several owners considered it a high-handed impropriety when they 
received calls from congressmen from other parts of the country 
asking about the Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	--Several owners have expressed a preference for Cooke's son,  
team president John Kent Cooke, to own the team. John Kent Cooke 
was outbid by Milstein and Snyder in an auction conducted by the 
trustees of his father's estate -- in accordance with his father's 
will after his death on April 6, 1997 -- but sources say some owners 
are eager to make the point they alone can choose who joins their 
exclusive club. 
</P>
<P>
	If Milstein is rejected and the trustees reopen the bidding, the  
favorite to win the second round would be Snyder. The 
Washington-area communications executive has the money in the bank 
and has come through the NFL process unscathed. Snyder could team 
with a losing bidder from the first round, such as Phoenix 
developer Sam Grossman, to mount a formidable bid. 
</P>
<P>
	But all that becomes moot if a defeated Milstein goes to court  
and ties up the process, although Milstein told the owners in 
Phoenix he would not sue. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless the sale is approved, John Kent Cooke will continue to  
run the team, retaining coach Norv Turner and general manager 
Charley Casserly. 
</P>
<P>
	Several free agents said they were wary of signing with the  
Redskins because of the uncertainty, and the players under contract 
want the matter resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of those things that has gone on too long,'' center  
Cory Raymer said Tuesday. ``And it's become a pain in the butt.''

<HEADLINE> Racist Gang Threats Probed in Texas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- State and federal authorities are investigating  
threats by a racist gang to hold a gathering in the town where a 
black man was dragged to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray said Texas prison  
officials told his office they intercepted letters from members of 
the Aryan Circle. Coded messages in the letters referred to ``a 
family reunion and annual Jasper tractor pull and drag racing 
event'' on April 19. 
</P>
<P>
	April 19 is the anniversary of the 1993 Branch Davidian fire in  
Waco, Texas. The Oklahoma City bombing occurred two years later. 
Both events have taken on symbolic importance to some extremists. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities told today's Dallas Morning News that they are  
taking the letters seriously. The group allegedly has influence 
outside the prison system. 
</P>
<P>
	``The language itself doesn't say something violent. These guys  
know their mail is monitored,'' Gray said. ``But knowing their 
history and thought processes, you'd almost have to assume it was 
going to be violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letters were sent by an inmate who served time with two of  
the men accused of dragging James Byrd Jr. to death with a truck. 
</P>
<P>
	The first of three alleged white supremacists to stand trial,  
John William King, 24, was sentenced to death in February. 
Co-defendant Lawrence Russell Brewer, 31, is scheduled to go on 
trial May 17. No trial date has been set for Shawn Allen Berry, 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray said authorities are concerned Aryan Circle members could  
be planning ``something retaliatory for King's conviction. It's 
very clear that racial extremists and hate groups behind bars are 
adopting King and Brewer as heroes.''

<HEADLINE> Spanish Novice Hopes To Win Masters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Apparently, someone forgot to tell ``El  
Nino'' that no amateur has won the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	Spanish teen-ager Sergio Garcia, whose nickname means the little  
boy, struts around Augusta National with the confidence of a pro 
twice his age. So, when someone asked Wednesday if an amateur dare 
dream of being fitted for a green jacket, Garcia didn't flinch. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very difficult, but I think it's possible to win,'' he  
said. ``You just have to have the week of your life -- playing 
great, putting great, do everything right. I think most of the 
amateurs that are playing in this Masters can have one of those 
weeks. Why not?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Why not, indeed. Garcia has seemed destined for greatness since  
he first swung a golf club at age 3. He was the champion of the 
Mediterraneo Club de Golf -- where his father ran the pro shop -- by 
the time he turned 12. He made the cut in his tour debut on the PGA 
European Tour at 14. He won the Catalonian Open at 17. Finally, he 
captured the British Amateur title last year to earn his first trip 
to the Masters at 19. 
</P>
<P>
	An impressive resume, to be sure. But it doesn't erase the cold,  
hard facts at Augusta National -- the green jacket has been reserved 
for pros only. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Stranahan came within two strokes of Jimmy Demaret in  
1947. Billy Joe Patton finished one stroke out of the 1954 playoff 
between Sam Snead and Ben Hogan. Ken Venturi had a four-stroke lead 
going into the final round in 1956, but shot a staggering 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Matt Kuchar tied for 21st with an even-par 288, the  
first amateur to make the cut since 1992 and the best score by an 
amateur since Rick Fehr in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuchar earned a return trip to Augusta, where he will be joined  
by Garcia and reigning U.S. Amateur champion Hank Kuehne, who was 
knocking balls onto Washington Avenue from the practice range, 
clearing an 85-foot fence that's 285 yards away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the amateur field is pretty good,'' said Garcia, who  
played Kuehne in a match play event near Atlanta a couple of weeks 
ago and won 6 and 4. ``Maybe we can do something good in this 
Masters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia played a practice round with Tiger Woods and Mark O'Meara  
-- the last two champions at Augusta National -- and gleaned some 
valuable knowledge from two-time champion and countryman Seve 
Ballesteros, whom Garcia calls his ``second father.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a great week around here, playing with all these  
great players,'' the teen-ager said. ``It's just something that I 
couldn't imagine when I qualified for the tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia has played four practice rounds at Augusta National since  
Saturday, to go along with two other rounds last November. He 
doesn't think a lack of course knowledge will be a problem in his 
Masters debut. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to be very patient all week,'' Garcia said. ``You  
must hit every shot with a lot of confidence and a lot of 
concentration, because it can cost you a lot of shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia got a taste of reality during his practice round with  
O'Meara and Woods. The two pros, showing their experience, lured 
the Spaniard and the other member of the foursome, Kuehne, into 
some friendly wagering. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I turn pro, I'd have to win three tournaments to pay back  
the dinners that we lost,'' Garcia quipped afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	All signs point to Garcia turning pro in the Spanish Open, two  
weeks after the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a thing I have to (discuss) with my dad, with all of my  
family, after this tournament,'' he said. ``I can't tell you for 
sure. I know it's going to be after this tournament, but I don't 
know exactly which day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Kuchar, the sensation from last year's Masters, Garcia will  
be accompanied on the course by his father, caddie-turned-teaching 
pro Victor Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of my dreams was to play in Augusta and one of his was  
caddying for me in Augusta,'' the younger Garcia said. `It's going 
to be a great week for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All signs point to a great career, as well.

<HEADLINE> Ill. Law Enforcers Go on Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHEATON, Ill. (AP) -- A man who spent nearly a decade on death  
row for a crime he didn't commit was charged with murder because of 
his own lies, argued attorneys for law enforcement officials 
accused of framing him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Finding the truth in Rolando Cruz is like finding a snowman on  
the sun,'' defense attorney Brian Telander said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Three former Illinois prosecutors and four sheriff's deputies  
are charged with railroading Cruz, who was convicted then acquitted 
of killing a 10-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening statements in their trial, which accuses them of lying  
in court, creating evidence and conspiring to obstruct Cruz's 
defense, began Tuesday and continued today. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did it with criminal intent and they got away with it  
twice,'' prosecutor William Kunkle said Tuesday. ``Maybe the 
tangled web finally gave way of its own nasty weight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Legal experts said they cannot recall another trial in which  
prosecutors were charged with crimes for how they handled a case. 
</P>
<P>
	All seven defendants are charged with conspiracy to obstruct  
justice and conspiracy to commit official misconduct. The sheriff's 
deputies face additional charges, including perjury. 
</P>
<P>
	Juries twice convicted Cruz of killing of Jeanine Nicarico, who  
was abducted from her home in the Chicago suburb of Naperville 
while sick from school in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities pressed on despite evidence that another man might  
have been the killer, despite repeated losses in appeals courts and 
despite a campaign by religious leaders, law school deans and 
journalists who were convinced Cruz was innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, during Cruz's third trial in 1995, came a stunning  
turnabout. 
</P>
<P>
	A supervisor in the sheriff's department recanted his previous  
testimony and cast doubt on a cornerstone of the prosecution -- that 
Cruz had revealed incriminating details to detectives in a 1983 
statement describing a ``vision'' or ``dream'' he had about the 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Cruz was found innocent and charges against co-defendant  
Alejandro Hernandez were dropped shortly after. 
</P>
<P>
	On trial are three former DuPage County prosecutors: Thomas  
Knight, now in private practice; Patrick King, now a federal 
prosecutor; and Robert Kilander, now a DuPage County judge. Also 
indicted were sheriff's Detectives Thomas Vosburgh and Dennis 
Kurzawa, and Lts. James Montesano and Robert Winkler. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants intend to attack Cruz as a liar who really was  
involved in the crime, and the case may well turn on how believable 
and sympathetic Cruz seems when he takes the stand. 
</P>
<P>
	Cruz was a small-time criminal who started out as an informant  
in the Nicarico killing but gradually became a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Terry Gillespie said Cruz tried to obstruct the  
investigation just because he didn't like police. 
</P>
<P>
	``The evidence will show that man is not a victim of anything,  
unless he's a victim of his own diabolical scheme,'' Gillespie said 
Tuesday. ``You'd be hard-pressed to find anybody involved with this 
judicial system who that man didn't lie to in 1983.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defense contends it's unbelievable that seven men, some of  
whom did not know each other well or like each other much, would 
engineer a decade-plus conspiracy that spanned three 
administrations in the state's attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense attorneys are also concerned about recent media  
coverage of several murder convicts found to be innocent in 
Illinois.

<HEADLINE> Decent Crowd Expected to See Expos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- The Montreal Expos are coming home with a  
winning record and, it appears, a decent crowd will be at Olympic 
Stadium to greet them. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 35,000 fans are expected Thursday night for the Expos'  
home opener against the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	Miguel Batista will pitch for Montreal while Orel Hershiser will  
make his Mets' debut. The Expos started the season by winning two 
of three at Pittsburgh; last year, they began 0-7. 
</P>
<P>
	``So just for that reason we're already better,'' manager Felipe  
Alou said after Wednesday's 4-3 win over the Pirates. ``Maybe we'll 
surprise some people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Revived by a provincial government pledge to help keep the team  
in Montreal, the Expos have attracted early attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``Three weeks ago we were worried, but I guess the commitment  
from the government has put a whole new perspective on things,'' 
Expos vice president Johanne Heroux said. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Wednesday afternoon, about 25,000 tickets had been sold,  
including 4,000 in a limited two-for-one offer from one of the 
team's sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	With walkups, the Expos should top the 12-year-low crowd 31,220  
that attended last year's opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than a month ago, it appeared the stadium might be nearly  
empty. 
</P>
<P>
	But then Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard announced his government  
was ready to put up several millions of dollars per year out of a 
tourism promotions budget toward a new downtown stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The pledge, expected to be made official soon, was a victory for  
team chairman Jacques Menard, who has led efforts since last 
October to get a new ball park and prevent Expos president Claude 
Brochu from selling the club to a U.S. buyer. 
</P>
<P>
	It also revived optimism that the Expos will be able to keep  
together a talented young team led by emerging superstar Vladimir 
Guerrero. 
</P>
<P>
	The Expos still have the lowest payroll in major league baseball  
at $17.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's up from about $8.5 million from last year and, for  
the first time in a decade, they haven't dumped a star player in 
the off-season because they could no longer afford him. 
</P>
<P>
	Until recently, the Expos weren't sure there would be a home  
opener. 
</P>
<P>
	A new roof on the stadium collapsed under the weight of snow  
during its installation this winter, prompting hasty repairs, and 
fire officials did not declare the building safe until March 19. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the latest of several incidents at the cavernous dome in  
the city's east end, which had a 55-ton block of concrete drop off 
its side in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	The Expos had baseball's lowest attendance last year --  
officially listed at 914,717. In fact, there were fewer than 
800,000 paid, according to team officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 3,500 season tickets have been sold this year, a total the  
Expos hope to improve ``once the club's future is determined,'' 
Heroux said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, there will be more (season tickets) next year, with  
an exciting ball club, more positive news and with a new marketing 
effort that will be launched this summer.''

<HEADLINE> Eve of Masters: It's Duval, Woods  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- The sun broke through overcast skies  
Wednesday at Augusta National as Ernie Els slipped quietly into the 
shade of a Georgia pine. 
</P>
<P>
	He couldn't imagine a better place to be on the eve of the 63rd  
Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	When the curtain rises on the first major championship of the  
year, the spotlight will be on David Duval and Tiger Woods, and the 
script has already been written -- the top two players in the world, 
settling matters in the most spectacular venue in golf. 
</P>
<P>
	That's just fine with Els.  
</P>
<P>
	The 29-year-old South African arrived at Augusta on Saturday  
with a fresh mind, a fine-tuned game and the kind of credentials 
worthy of a favorite at any major championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Just not this one, not this year.  
</P>
<P>
	``The only talk is Tiger and David,'' Els said. ``I could ask  
myself the question that maybe I should play in that group. But the 
only to do that is to win again. If I win the Masters, you guys 
will want to write about me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Or maybe someone else.  
</P>
<P>
	Under the live oak tree located between the clubhouse and the  
first tee, Phil Mickelson held court for 10 minutes after he and 
John Huston teamed up to whip Duval and John Daly in their final 
practice round before the tournament starts. 
</P>
<P>
	In only his seventh year on the PGA Tour, Mickelson already is  
becoming a forgotten favorite in the majors, in part because he 
hasn't really contended in any of the last eight. This is the first 
time Mickelson has come to the Masters without already having won 
in the year, and that includes his lone appearance as an amateur. 
</P>
<P>
	It doesn't help that he is 165th on the tour in final-round  
scoring at 75.29, which includes an 82 on Sunday in The Players 
Championship after being within one stroke of the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Mickelson has won 13 times already. Like Els, he is  
lurking. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been trying to build up for this week,'' he said. ``What  
I've been lacking this year is focus for 72 holes. I've played well 
for 54 holes in several tournaments, and I feel like I'm just about 
ready to play well for 72.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark O'Meara spent more time talking about Woods and Duval than  
his own chances to become only the third player to repeat as 
champion. Fred Couples, who tied for second last year with Duval, 
wants another crack at a green jacket but no one seems to listen. 
</P>
<P>
	Justin Leonard, whose four victories include the British Open  
and The Players Championship, has finished in the top 10 the last 
two Masters. Jim Furyk and his loopy swing don't look like a good 
fit for Augusta, but he was right in the thick of it last year 
until going in the water on the 15th on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Westwood of England has won as many tournaments as Duval in  
the same amount of time, even if only one came on American soil. 
Still, Europeans have won 10 of the past 19 Masters, and he has 
been around Augusta enough to know how to attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tiger and David may be the best two at the moment, but I'm not  
too far behind,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the largest field in the Masters in 33 years, even if it  
sounds like the green jacket will be fitted for one of two players 
-- Woods or Duval. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone badly wants to win,'' Els said. ``I want to win this  
tournament. I've had good preparations, and I've got a good 
feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If anyone can spoil the Duval-Woods showdown, it's Els.  
</P>
<P>
	With two U.S. Opens, he has won more majors than Woods and Duval  
combined. He also has more victories than both of them -- 29 around 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods has won 10 times, including the 1997 Masters and two  
tournaments overseas. All of Duval's 11 victories have come on the 
PGA Tour, including four already this year and all of them in the 
past 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
	All that is missing is the major.  
</P>
<P>
	``All those guys think they can, and David Duval is one that  
thinks that -- and is doing that,'' Couples said. ``He's a lot 
better than a lot of people, and he's a little better than Ernie 
Els and Tiger Woods and Greg Norman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the magic of the Masters will allow for Duval and Woods  
to match shot for shot on the back nine of Augusta. They have never 
been paired together in a final round, and they have rarely been in 
contention during the final nine holes of any tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the exceptions was two months ago in Los Angeles, where  
Els dusted off both of them. The victory made the South African 
known as the ``Big Easy'' the first player since Jack Nicklaus to 
win at least once in his first six years on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Does that sound like someone who can be left out of the mix in  
the Masters? 
</P>
<P>
	The fact this has turned into David vs. Goliath (David is the  
betting favorite again) has not caused any bitterness among those 
eager to prove the Masters has much more to offer. 
</P>

	``David has brought this on himself,'' Els said with a laugh.  
``We talk about him because he's winning every week. The guy has 
been blowing everybody out of the water. I'd like to know what's 
going on his head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More interesting is the size of his bank account. He already has  
won close to $2.6 million after just eight tournaments and comes 
into Augusta having won the last two weeks. He believes he is good 
enough to win. No one doubts he is playing well enough, least of 
all Duval. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also knows that Augusta can have its own agenda.  
</P>
<P>
	``Each tournament is a new start, a new chance, and that's how I  
view it,'' Duval said. ``I feel like I'm capable of winning out 
here. I don't just assume I'm going to win. I know I'm going to 
have to get some good breaks and play quality shots.''

<HEADLINE> Novelist in Posthumous Opera Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- More than three years after his death, renowned  
Canadian novelist Robertson Davies makes his opera debut as 
librettist for a world-premiere production based on an ancient 
Roman tale. 
</P>
<P>
	Davies' adaptation of the ``The Golden Ass'' was his last work,  
completed shortly before he died at 82 in December 1995. He helped 
pick the composer and was a personal friend of the director, but 
never had a chance to hear the full score or see the show take 
shape. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact the score, by composer Randolph Peters, didn't get  
finished until a few weeks before rehearsals began at the Canadian 
Opera Company on March 5. The opera will be performed April 13. 
</P>
<P>
	It represents one of the company's most ambitious attempts to  
present a brand-new opera with predominantly Canadian origins and 
personnel. At a cost of $1.2 million, it is the most expensive 
opera commissioned by the company in two decades and has a huge 
entourage, including a 55-member orchestra, 40-member chorus and 
eight dancers for a ballet scene that Davies insisted upon. 
</P>
<P>
	Davies, considered by many to be the most accomplished Canadian  
novelist of all time, was an actor in his youth, an enthusiastic 
pianist and a lifelong opera lover. 
</P>
<P>
	As far back as 1989, the Canadian Opera Company's executive  
director, Richard Bradshaw, urged Davies to write a libretto. 
</P>
<P>
	The author initially demurred, but admitted -- when the topic was  
raised again six years later -- that he had in fact been toying with 
the idea of an opera adapted from a nearly 2,000-year-old Roman 
tale, ``The Golden Ass,'' by Apuleius. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the story of a handsome, hedonistic man named Lucius whose  
curiosity about magic leads to his transformation into a donkey, 
with subsequent misadventures as he tries to earn back his human 
shape. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradshaw, who will conduct ``The Golden Ass,'' said Davies  
``knew his marquee value'' and set his sights high when the early 
discussions of the project turned to a composer. Davies would have 
wanted Leonard Bernstein, had he still been alive, and encouraged 
preliminary contacts with Andre Previn, who was occupied with his 
``A Streetcar Named Desire'' opera project, Bradshaw said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradshaw had his own idea. He sent part of Davies' libretto to  
Randolph Peters, asked for some samples of music, then had the 
compositions played for Davies, who was delighted. That clinched 
the composing job for Peters, whose previous work, ``Nosferatu,'' 
was a Canadian Opera Company world premiere in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The experimental ``Nosferatu'' score received mixed reviews, and  
Bradshaw says Peters' work for ``The Golden Ass'' is likely to 
resonate more warmly with audiences. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's witty, it's bright,'' Bradshaw said. ``We thought in  
places there should be a very strong underlying jazz element.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As director, Bradshaw recruited Colin Graham, a U.S.-based  
Briton who was a friend of Davies. Graham has directed more than 50 
productions of new operas, including many of the works of Benjamin 
Britten as well as Previn's ``Streetcar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradshaw says Graham had the confidence to make some changes in  
the original libretto, even explaining his revisions to Davies' 
wife, Brenda. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Davies, a former actress, has attended some of the  
rehearsals and is expected to receive a tribute on opening night. 
</P>
<P>
	The cast is mostly Canadian, although the role of Lucius will be  
sung by American tenor Kevin Anderson. The choreography is by Debra 
Graham, long associated with the Montreal-based Cirque du Soleil. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradshaw sees the whole project as a gamble, and will consider  
himself a winner if ``The Golden Ass'' is sought by other 
companies. Directors or managers are coming to the premiere from 
top opera companies in the United States, Britain and France. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to us that it go elsewhere,'' Bradshaw said.  
``Everyone is looking for the new opera that works. We need a 
20th-century opera that enters the repertoire.''

<HEADLINE> Saturday Deadline Looms for WNBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	By the weekend, we will have a pretty good indication whether  
women athletes and administrators are as pigheaded as their male 
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
	The WNBA has set a Saturday deadline for its players union to  
reach agreement on a new contract -- or else. Commissioner Val 
Ackerman would not provide specifics about what ``or else'' meant -- 
``I can't discuss our options,'' she said Tuesday -- but with the 
start of training camps only a month away, locking out the players 
is certainly at the top of a very short list. 
</P>
<P>
	Left unsaid was an even greater threat, that more than a dozen  
women's leagues have gone under in the past 20 years or so. The 
most recent casualty was the ABL, which was forced to close up shop 
three days before Christmas, just after tipping off what would have 
been its third season. 
</P>
<P>
	Most people would agree there has to be enough business for the  
bosses and the workers to begin bickering about how to cut it up, 
but even that point is in contention in the WNBA labor dispute. 
Ackerman said the mere fact there's an argument proves only that 
the league is on its way to becoming a business, not that it's 
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look upon it as a rite of passage,'' she said. ``We said in  
the beginning we want to be major league. Unions are an 
accouterment of major league sports. To that extent, it's not a 
surprise we're in bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess we're on the fast track. I think bargaining can and  
should be a constructive process to anticipate concerns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The players, on the other hand, think it's well past the time  
for anticipating concerns. They want those concerns addressed now. 
</P>
<P>
	``Loyalty is a two-way street,'' WNBA Players' Association  
spokeswoman Pam Wheeler said. ``The players have shown themselves 
willing to sacrifice in order to build the league. They were loyal 
and now they expect some loyalty in return.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like every set of negotiations between players and owners, it  
would require more space than is available here to present the 
arguments for either side. Suffice it to say that just like every 
set of negotiations, it's about money. 
</P>
<P>
	The union wants the minimum salary raised from $15,000 to  
$45,000, a cut of merchandising sales, retirement benefits and the 
right to challenge disciplinary action. The league counters that it 
is offering a 30 percent increase in salaries, year-round health, 
dental and maternity benefits and offseason career programs. It 
pegs the compensation package on the table at $60,000 a player. 
</P>
<P>
	Any time a movement begins to gain momentum, the way women's pro  
sports have in recent years, the debate intensifies over which 
direction to take next. Slow growth, or speed it up? Follow the 
model established by men's sports, or try to develop something 
better? 
</P>
<P>
	Making matters even more difficult in the current round of  
negotiations is the bitter taste left by the NBA lockout that 
pitted millionaire players against multimillionaire owners and was 
resolved only after shrinking the regular season from 82 games to 
50. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the unfortunate part,'' Wheeler said, ``that this had  
to come up right after the NBA trouble. But if people take just a 
minute to look at what's involved here, they'll see it's like 
comparing apples and oranges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She makes a good point. The NBA players, with an average salary  
of more than $2 million, lost about $400 million in salaries while 
the bickering stretched out. The WNBA and its union are about $2 
million apart -- total. Depending on whose numbers you buy, the 
average player makes between $31,000 and $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The good news is that the talks so far have been characterized  
by both sides as cordial, marked by give and take. The bad news is 
that except for those involved or those with a direct stake in 
them, nobody could care less. 
</P>
<P>
	Women's pro basketball is still a fragile commodity that, noble  
intentions aside, will have to turn a profit sooner rather than 
later. Without seeing the books, it's hard to know which side to 
root for, but that's almost besides the point. This is one struggle 
neither side can afford to lose. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the marketing muscle and operating expertise of the  
NBA behind it, the WNBA is far from established. Last year, it 
averaged crowds of 9,669 and a television rating hovering around 
2.0. That's hardly enough to fight over for the time being. And if 
the league and the players do just that -- fight -- loudly or for 
very long, winning will hardly have been worth the effort. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Williams Sisters May Make Fed Squad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Now that Venus and Serena Williams have  
received their primer on the Fed Cup, it shouldn't be much longer 
before they represent the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. team captain Billie Jean King talked with the tennis  
playing sisters last weekend and thinks she made some progress 
toward including the two on the next Fed Cup squad. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told them what the Fed Cup is about because they really  
didn't know,'' King said. ``And hopefully, they will be available 
in July, but I don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the honors go to Lindsay Davenport, the No. 2 player in  
the world; Monica Seles, ranked fourth; Chanda Rubin and Lisa 
Raymond. The U.S. will face Croatia in a quarterfinal match on 
April 17-18. 
</P>
<P>
	The match was originally scheduled for Zagreb, Croatia, but the  
current NATO military action against Yugoslavia led officials to 
move the match here for safety considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	King's talk with the Williams sisters was made possible with the  
help of Pam Shriver and Zina Garrison, both mentors to the sisters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was able to have a nice discussion on Sunday with both of  
the players,'' King said Tuesday. ``.... I was very pleased with 
what transpired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Currently ranked 11th, Serena Williams may not have been able to  
play next weekend even if she knew the history of the Fed Cup, 
according to King. 
</P>
<P>
	``Serena's left knee had been bothering her, and she has done  
very, very well over the last month ... and she just felt that her 
left knee was not going to cut it,'' King said. ``She needed a 
rest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Venus Williams is ranked sixth by the WTA. She and with her  
sister made tennis history when they faced each other in the finals 
of the Lipton Championships last month. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, the International Tennis Federation announced it is  
changing the Fed Cup format for the second time in five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Next year's competition will feature a 13-nation World Group,  
with 12 teams competing in a round-robin stage for three semifinal 
spots and the defending champion earning an automatic berth in the 
final four. 
</P>
<P>
	The round-robin phase will take place over one week. The finals  
will be staged in another week at a venue selected by the defending 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
	In the new format, the eight teams in the 1999 World Group One  
will automatically go into the qualifying round along with the four 
winning teams from World Group Two. 
</P>
<P>
	The final spot will go to the winner of a playoff between the  
four remaining World Group Two nations and the four regional 
qualifying Group One winners.

<HEADLINE>  Hero Sailor Poised To Win Solo Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Giovanni Soldini already is a hero. Now he can become a  
champion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian sailor has a 10-day lead heading into the fourth and  
final leg of the Around Alone yacht race, a 27,000-mile, nine-month 
odyssey that takes solo sailors through some of the world's most 
treacherous seas. 
</P>
<P>
	With that kind of cushion, he could sail backward for several  
days and still win. Still, he knows that Atlantic winds are fickle 
-- and remembers his embarrassment there on the first leg, where one 
tactical mistake left him too close to the ocean calms and 500 
miles behind his competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine sailors -- down from an original fleet of 16 -- will take off  
April 10 from Punta del Este, Uruguay, heading through the tropics 
to Charleston, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	More than the scenery changes: Sailors have spent the last few  
weeks stripping their boats of heavy weather gear as the course 
shifts from a roller-coaster survival run into a tricky, tactical 
upwind dance along the South American coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The race itself was wide open until the third leg, when the  
sailors left Auckland, New Zealand, on Feb. 5 to traverse the 
unpredictable waters around Cape Horn. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the carnage began. Within days, Josh Hall of Britain lost  
his mast and was out of the race; Isabelle Autissier, a heavy 
favorite to win, flipped and could not right her 60-foot yacht, 
PRB; Marc Thiercelin, a fellow French native who was her main 
rival, saw his 80-foot mast crumple and smash a large hole in his 
deck. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was lucky that my head was not cut off,'' Thiercelin said at  
the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Into it all rode Soldini, barreling through 30-foot seas to find  
Autissier's upside-down boat 22 hours later in a Pacific region so 
remote that national rescue agencies would not venture into it. 
Taking only her passport, Autissier opened her boat's final hatch 
and sent her million-dollar racing machine to the ocean floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I am here today, if I am able to speak to you, to laugh or  
cry or whatever, it is because Giovanni came,'' she told the 
hundreds who greeted her and Soldini when they arrived March 3 in 
Punta del Este. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, I am sad about my boat, but to be alive is  
better,'' she added. 
</P>
<P>
	Autissier, one of the finest single-handed sailors, gave up her  
decade-long quest to win the race and announced her retirement. 
Soldini earned a medal of heroism from Italy -- and the deep 
admiration of thousands following the race on its Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Thiercelin made a makeshift mast, saw his lead evaporate into a  
huge deficit and was vilified in cyberspace for not coming to 
Autissier's aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldini and Thiercelin are all that's left of Class I, for boats  
up to 60 feet. In Class II, for boats up to 50 feet, Jean-Pierre 
Mouligne of France has a nearly an eight-day lead and is the 
favorite to win. 
</P>
<P>
	But the racing spirit has not been lost -- a fight for second has  
emerged between 54-year-old Mike Garside of Britain and Brad Van 
Liew, 31, of Santa Monica, Calif., the youngest sailor and only 
American left. 
</P>
<P>
	After 35 strenuous days on the second leg, the two Class II  
racers arrived in Auckland within 2 1/2 minutes of each other -- the 
closest finish in race history. Garside has a 9 1/2-hour lead over Van 
Liew going into the fourth leg. 
</P>
<P>
	``This race-within-a-race has definitely increased the stress  
level,'' Van Liew said from Punta del Este, where he was 
overhauling his boat and trying to gain back some of the 30 pounds 
he had lost on the third leg. ``The next leg, all the gloves are 
off.''

<HEADLINE> Lindros' Father Urges Caution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Eric Lindros' father urged the  
Philadelphia Flyers to ``err on the side of caution'' when it comes 
to his son, who was hospitalized with a collapsed lung. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to wait for the doctors to convince me that he is going  
to be playing in the near future. Eric is going to make the final 
decision,'' said Carl Lindros. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors removed a tube from Eric Lindros' chest, but when the  
Flyers captain can return home remains uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to see how everything goes now with the tube out, make  
sure that he's comfortable and make sure that things remain 
stable,'' team physician Dr. Gary Dorshimer said Tuesday after 
speaking with doctors at Baptist Hospital in Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
	The team was hoping to bring the Flyers' star center and one of  
the top scorers in the NHL home today. But Dorshimer said traveling 
depends on how Lindros heals over the next day or so. 
</P>
<P>
	``He obviously has some relief of his pain with that tube being  
out,'' Dorshimer said. ``He had a decent night's sleep, and he's 
planning to do a little more walking around ....'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors were worried that Lindros' right lung might collapse  
again when the tube keeping it inflated was removed. But Dorshimer 
said the X-rays look good. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros woke up in pain Friday morning after a 2-1 victory over  
the Nashville Predators the night before. At about six pints of 
blood had seeped into his chest cavity, apparently causing his 
right lung to collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorshimer said doctors will have to study his progress to  
determine any further treatment once he returns home.

<HEADLINE> Media Giants To Sell Music Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Media giants Seagram Co. and Bertelsmann AG are  
joining forces to sell music online, where they face stiff 
competition from online retailers like Amazon.com and CDnow. 
</P>
<P>
	Seagram's Universal Music Group unit and Bertelsmann's BMG  
Entertainment subsidiary are hoping to use their relationships with 
hundreds of artists to lure online customers by offering access to 
stars, video and audio clips and other proprietary content. 
</P>
<P>
	Together the companies control about 40 percent of the American  
music market, including record labels Geffen, A&AMP;M, Arista and RCA. 
Represented artists include Jimi Hendrix, Kenny G, Motley Crue and 
TLC. 
</P>
<P>
	The joint venture announced in New York Wednesday would add  
Universal artists to five existing Web sites run by BMG which cater 
to specific musical tastes, such as peeps.com for hip-hop and 
twangthis.com for country music. 
</P>
<P>
	The sites are linked to a new online music store, getmusic.com,  
which would also offer CDs from other labels. All the sites are 
currently running, but the companies expect to launch revamped 
versions this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Record companies have been scrambling to come up with online  
music strategies as it becomes easier to download bootleg music 
from the Internet. They are hoping to agree on a digital standard 
that would allow them to control the downloading of music and 
ensure that the companies and artists receive royalties. 
</P>
<P>
	So far Seagram and Bertelsmann are not talking about letting  
users download music themselves, although the move to establish a 
beachhead in cyberspace could clearly set the stage for such 
efforts in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement of the project received lukewarm views from  
industry analysts, who say the effort may need to evolve before 
finding success with consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``In terms of building an online sales site around specific  
music genres, record companies may be putting the cart before the 
horse,'' said Melissa Blane, an analyst with the Yankee Group 
consulting company in Boston. ``First-time online music shoppers 
are more likely to go to a general music site.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If I were Amazon, I wouldn't be afraid right now,'' agreed  
James McQuivey, a senior analyst with the consulting group 
Forrester Research. 
</P>
<P>
	For the moment, music retailers don't appear to be worried about  
record companies taking away their business with online sales. 
Marcia Apple, vice president of leading music retailer Musicland 
Stores Corp. of Minneapolis, says that any new technology that 
increases awareness of music can help sell music overall. 
</P>
<P>
	``From our perspective, people are just trying to figure out  
where this new distribution channel is going,'' Apple said. ``The 
music clubs were supposed to kill the record retailers, but they 
didn't. It's another in a series of distribution systems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Apple said that Musicland plans to have its Sam Goody stores set  
up Internet sales sites this June. 
</P>
<P>
	BMG already runs a mail-order music club, which competes with  
the Columbia House direct sales unit run by Time Warner Inc. and 
Sony Corp. The online operations of BMG's music club would not be 
affected by the arrangement with Universal. 
</P>
<P>
	Seagram's stock surged $4.06 1/4 or 7.4 percent to $59 on the New  
York Stock Exchange Wednesday on news of the Bertelsmann deal. Also 
influencing Seagram shares were an agreement Wednesday to sell its 
Grammercy and October film studios and part of its Polygram film 
unit to USA Networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors have been rewarding the Montreal-based company,  
traditionally known as a whiskey maker, as it builds up its 
entertainment holdings, which include the Universal movie studio. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to its music business, Germany-based Bertelsmann, a  
private company, also owns the publishing houses Random House and 
Bantam Doubleday Dell, and has a half interest in Barnes &AMP; Noble's 
online bookstore.

<HEADLINE> Israelis Claim New Kissing Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- After kissing for what they called a  
world-record 30 hours and 45 minutes, an Israeli couple was treated 
for fatigue at a hospital Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Downham, the head of research at the Guinness Book of  
Records, said he still had to verify the world record claim of the 
Israeli couple, Dror Orpaz and Karmit Tsubera. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous kissing record of 29 hours was set last year in New  
York. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair was among 300 couples who participated in a marathon  
kissing contest sponsored by a U.S. toothpaste company. 
</P>
<P>
	The contest, held in Tel Aviv's main square, kicked off at 8:30  
p.m. Monday. By 3 p.m. Tuesday, only two couples remained, and 12 
hours later Orpaz and Tsubera were the only ones still kissing.

<HEADLINE> Kissinger, Ueberroth on IOC Panel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- One helped broker peace in Vietnam and the  
Middle East. The other helped turn the Olympics from nearly broke 
into a virtual money machine. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, the IOC hopes Henry Kissinger and Peter Ueberroth can  
help clean up its worst scandal and make sure it never recurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic sources said Tuesday that Kissinger, the former  
secretary of state, and Ueberroth, head organizer of the 1984 
Summer Games in Los Angeles, had been picked for a panel to 
restructure the International Olympic Committee in the wake of the 
Salt Lake bribery case. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not known if either accepted the appointments from IOC  
president Juan Antonio Samaranch, but news that Kissinger was 
involved brought immediate praise from the IOC's harshest 
congressional critic, Sen. John McCain. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is pleased to see the appointment of someone of Dr.  
Kissinger's stature,'' said Pia Pialorsi, a spokeswoman for the 
Arizona Republican whose Commerce Committee has scheduled hearings 
on the Olympic scandal next week. 
</P>
<P>
	She said McCain still hoped for quick reforms by the IOC ``to  
ensure transparency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said  
Samaranch also asked IOC vice president Anita DeFrantz to serve on 
the panel, IOC 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Hybl, president of the U.S. Olympic Committee, was the  
first member announced earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Kissinger, Ueberroth and DeFrantz were traveling Tuesday and  
unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, were closed for the  
day and communications director Franklin Servan-Schreiber was 
unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC 2000 was set up last month as the committee's primary engine  
for change after the Salt Lake scandal, in which six members were 
expelled in a million-dollar gifts-for-votes scheme involving the 
Utah capital's successful quest for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission will have 20-24 members, half from the IOC and  
half ``leading personalities who understand sport,'' and 
essentially will come up with a new version of the Olympic Charter, 
the IOC's century-old bylaws. 
</P>
<P>
	It will study and make recommendations on selection of Olympic  
host cities; how IOC members are elected; term limits; structure 
and membership of the ruling executive board; and further roles for 
Olympic athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel also will look at revenue sharing and the evolution of  
the games themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch wants the commission to meet in early June, with an  
interim report presented to the IOC general assembly later that 
month in Seoul, South Korea, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch, as IOC president, will head the commission and  
appoint its members, two points attacked last month by critics, 
including McCain, who felt the panel needed more independence. 
</P>
<P>
	But with Kissinger a member, the IOC reform panel gains instant  
credibility because of his long record of statesmanship and 
diplomacy. Samaranch had mentioned Kissinger as the type of 
heavyweight he wanted on the commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Ueberroth also brings weight -- and an educated outsider's view --  
to the commission. 
</P>
<P>
	After leading the Los Angeles Games to athletic success and a  
$225 million surplus that convinced cities and sponsors the 
Olympics were a good investment, Ueberroth served as baseball 
commissioner and now heads the Contrarian Group, a venture capital 
company based in southern California. He has been critical of the 
IOC and its president. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz was a bronze-medal rower at the 1976 Games who sued  
over the White House-led boycott of the 1980 Games in Moscow. She 
worked with Ueberroth in 1984, was appointed to the IOC in 1986 and 
now runs the foundation of amateur sports in Los Angeles, financed 
by seed money from the '84 surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl, a former Colorado prosecutor, heads El Pomar, one of the  
nation's largest charitable foundations. He has been USOC president 
since 1996 and headed the ethics investigation into the 1994 
scandal involving figure skating rivals Tonya Harding and Nancy 
Kerrigan.

<HEADLINE> Diller Purchases Two Movie Studios </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Media mogul Barry Diller will get a  
much-needed movie pipeline for his cable outlets with his purchase 
of Seagram Co.'s art house labels October Films, Gramercy Pictures 
and the remains of Polygram Filmed Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase provides Diller -- who once ran Paramount Pictures --  
with movies for his cable channels USA Network and Sci-Fi Channel. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, announced Wednesday, also positions Diller as a major  
competitor to Miramax, the leader of the art house genre. 
</P>
<P>
	October and Gramercy are major distributors of so-called art  
house films, which offer unconventional themes and are produced on 
relatively small budgets. 
</P>
<P>
	The new movie venture, to be called USA Films, will be headed by  
Scott Greenstein, who had been one of the presidents of October 
Films. USA Films will be a division of USA Networks Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the art house labels, Diller also purchased  
PolyGram's domestic movie operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was valued at between $200 million and $300 million,  
according to sources. 
</P>
<P>
	For Montreal-based Seagram, the sale helps reduce the heavy debt  
it took on last year through its $10.4 billion purchase of 
PolyGram's parent company,PolyGram NV. 
</P>
<P>
	Ever since that deal was struck, Seagram had been looking for  
buyers for much of PolyGram's movie assets, while planning to 
retain its large recorded music business. 
</P>
<P>
	Seagram, which also owns Universal Studios, will keep its hands  
in the art house film business. Universal has a deal with Working 
Title Films -- a production house formerly affiliated with Gramercy 
-- to create three to five movies a year with budgets of up to $20 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Working Title has a strong track record that includes the Oscar  
nominees ``Elizabeth'' and ``Fargo'' and the blockbuster ``Four 
Weddings and a Funeral.'' It also produced the upcoming Julia 
Roberts-Hugh Grant romance ``Notting Hill,'' which will be 
distributed by Universal on May 28. 
</P>
<P>
	Seagram will maintain close ties to Diller with a 45 percent  
ownership stake in USA Networks Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	While Diller doesn't get the creative minds at Working Title, he  
has in October Films a company with an impressive history in the 
independent movie business. 
</P>
<P>
	Its 60 releases include ``Hilary and Jackie,'' ``Secrets and  
Lies,'' ``The Apostle'' and the current release ``Cookie's 
Fortune'' from director Robert Altman. Its upcoming films include 
Sundance Film Festival winner ``Three Seasons'' and Albert Brooks' 
``The Muse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diller got back into the movie business in the same manner he  
launched his television operation: by shopping at Seagram. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Seagram chief executive Edgar Bronfman Jr. shocked  
Hollywood by selling most of Universal's television assets to his 
mentor, Diller. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the USA Network and Sci-Fi Channel, Diller's USA  
Networks now includes Home Shopping Network and Ticketmaster, the 
telephone ticket ordering service. 
</P>
<P>
	After Bronfman sold the TV assets, questions swept the  
entertainment industry on whether he would remain committed to the 
movie business. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation heightened as Bronfman bought PolyGram to bolster  
his music business and after Universal produced a string of movie 
flops last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech last month in Canada, Bronfman insisted he was  
committed to films, saying the movie business ``plays an important 
strategic role in enhancing the value of our other entertainment 
assets.''

<HEADLINE> More Charges in Ill. License Scam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Six people, including two former supervisors at a  
suburban Chicago driver's licensing facility, have been charged 
with selling commercial driver's licenses to hundreds of 
unqualified applicants. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors said from 1991 to 1998, the six defendants  
conspired to make sure certain applicants passed licensing tests at 
an Illinois Secretary of State facility. They took bribes of up to 
$1,200 per license, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two former managers of the McCook office -- Marion Seibel, 61, of  
Lemont, and George Velasco, 50, of Westchester -- were charged, 
along with three state Transportation Department workers and a 
trucking company employee. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictments bring to a dozen the number of people charged in  
the U.S. attorney's Operation Safe Road investigation. As with past 
defendants, some of those charged Tuesday were accused of using the 
bribes to purchase campaign fund-raising tickets for Gov. George 
Ryan. Ryan was secretary of state prior to entering the governor's 
office in January. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we've charged another case like this where  
there's been this extent of bribery (money) that went into a 
political campaign,'' said U.S. Attorney Scott Lassar. ``It's an 
unusual case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lassar has said previously that Ryan is not a target of the  
federal probe. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan spokesman Dave Urbanek said his boss knew nothing of the  
alleged scheme to sell licenses or to convert the money into 
campaign contributions. He said workers were not pressured to sell 
fund-raising tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Lassar said his office has discovered that more than 400 drivers  
illegally obtained licenses. The investigation is continuing, he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Eve of Masters: It's Duval, Woods  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- The sun broke through overcast skies  
Wednesday at Augusta National as Ernie Els slipped quietly into the 
shade of a Georgia pine. 
</P>
<P>
	He couldn't imagine a better place to be on the eve of the 63rd  
Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	When the curtain rises on the first major championship of the  
year, the spotlight will be on David Duval and Tiger Woods, and the 
script has already been written -- the top two players in the world, 
settling matters in the most spectacular venue in golf. 
</P>
<P>
	That's just fine with Els.  
</P>
<P>
	The 29-year-old South African arrived at Augusta on Saturday  
with a fresh mind, a fine-tuned game and the kind of credentials 
worthy of a favorite at any major championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Just not this one, not this year.  
</P>
<P>
	``The only talk is Tiger and David,'' Els said. ``I could ask  
myself the question that maybe I should play in that group. But the 
only to do that is to win again. If I win the Masters, you guys 
will want to write about me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Or maybe someone else.  
</P>
<P>
	Under the live oak tree located between the clubhouse and the  
first tee, Phil Mickelson held court for 10 minutes after he and 
John Huston teamed up to whip Duval and John Daly in their final 
practice round before the tournament starts. 
</P>
<P>
	In only his seventh year on the PGA Tour, Mickelson already is  
becoming a forgotten favorite in the majors, in part because he 
hasn't really contended in any of the last eight. This is the first 
time Mickelson has come to the Masters without already having won 
in the year, and that includes his lone appearance as an amateur. 
</P>
<P>
	It doesn't help that he is 165th on the tour in final-round  
scoring at 75.29, which includes an 82 on Sunday in The Players 
Championship after being within one stroke of the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Mickelson has won 13 times already. Like Els, he is  
lurking. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been trying to build up for this week,'' he said. ``What  
I've been lacking this year is focus for 72 holes. I've played well 
for 54 holes in several tournaments, and I feel like I'm just about 
ready to play well for 72.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark O'Meara spent more time talking about Woods and Duval than  
his own chances to become only the third player to repeat as 
champion. Fred Couples, who tied for second last year with Duval, 
wants another crack at a green jacket but no one seems to listen. 
</P>
<P>
	Justin Leonard, whose four victories include the British Open  
and The Players Championship, has finished in the top 10 the last 
two Masters. Jim Furyk and his loopy swing don't look like a good 
fit for Augusta, but he was right in the thick of it last year 
until going in the water on the 15th on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Westwood of England has won as many tournaments as Duval in  
the same amount of time, even if only one came on American soil. 
Still, Europeans have won 10 of the past 19 Masters, and he has 
been around Augusta enough to know how to attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tiger and David may be the best two at the moment, but I'm not  
too far behind,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the largest field in the Masters in 33 years, even if it  
sounds like the green jacket will be fitted for one of two players 
-- Woods or Duval. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone badly wants to win,'' Els said. ``I want to win this  
tournament. I've had good preparations, and I've got a good 
feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If anyone can spoil the Duval-Woods showdown, it's Els.  
</P>
<P>
	With two U.S. Opens, he has won more majors than Woods and Duval  
combined. He also has more victories than both of them -- 29 around 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods has won 10 times, including the 1997 Masters and two  
tournaments overseas. All of Duval's 11 victories have come on the 
PGA Tour, including four already this year and all of them in the 
past 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
	All that is missing is the major.  
</P>
<P>
	``All those guys think they can, and David Duval is one that  
thinks that -- and is doing that,'' Couples said. ``He's a lot 
better than a lot of people, and he's a little better than Ernie 
Els and Tiger Woods and Greg Norman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the magic of the Masters will allow for Duval and Woods  
to match shot for shot on the back nine of Augusta. They have never 
been paired together in a final round, and they have rarely been in 
contention during the final nine holes of any tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the exceptions was two months ago in Los Angeles, where  
Els dusted off both of them. The victory made the South African 
known as the ``Big Easy'' the first player since Jack Nicklaus to 
win at least once in his first six years on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Does that sound like someone who can be left out of the mix in  
the Masters? 
</P>
<P>
	The fact this has turned into David vs. Goliath (David is the  
betting favorite again) has not caused any bitterness among those 
eager to prove the Masters has much more to offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``David has brought this on himself,'' Els said with a laugh.  
``We talk about him because he's winning every week. The guy has 
been blowing everybody out of the water. I'd like to know what's 
going on his head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More interesting is the size of his bank account. He already has  
won close to $2.6 million after just eight tournaments and comes 
into Augusta having won the last two weeks. He believes he is good 
enough to win. No one doubts he is playing well enough, least of 
all Duval. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also knows that Augusta can have its own agenda.  
</P>
<P>
	``Each tournament is a new start, a new chance, and that's how I  
view it,'' Duval said. ``I feel like I'm capable of winning out 
here. I don't just assume I'm going to win. I know I'm going to 
have to get some good breaks and play quality shots.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Makes Changes to His Web Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore, the presidential candidate most  
closely associated with technology savvy, launched his campaign 
into cyberspace -- and nearly stumbled over the nettlesome problem 
of Internet privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's campaign rushed Tuesday to remove from its new Web site  
questions asking children for their names, e-mail addresses and zip 
codes -- a practice soon to be outlawed on some Internet sites by 
legislation Congress approved last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign stripped the questions from the ``Just for Kids''  
section of its Web site less than one hour before the pages were 
published Tuesday on the Internet, after The Associated Press 
raised questions about them during a preview for news 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	A new privacy law, signed by the President Clinton last year,  
generally prohibits asking children such questions on commercial 
Web sites unless companies first obtain a parent's permission. 
</P>
<P>
	The law takes effect in 2001, although federal regulators -- who  
have yet to determine how they will enforce the ban -- indicated 
Tuesday it won't cover campaign Internet sites. 
</P>
<P>
	As originally designed, Gore's Web site offered children the  
opportunity to receive campaign materials electronically if they 
submitted their first and last name, e-mail address and zip code. 
They also could send Gore questions via e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	The site also included a link to a privacy statement -- rare  
among the Web pages of any of the presidential candidates -- with 
specific suggestions for children, such as warning them not to give 
out personal information without a parent's permission. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign officials maintain that their original version would  
not have violated the new privacy law, but they decided to remove 
the questions anyway -- except for asking children their first name. 
</P>
<P>
	Kids can still electronically send questions to Gore, who  
promised to reply to one or two each day on the Web. But the 
campaign added a warning to ``PLEASE ask your parents if it is OK 
to give us the following information before you submit questions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's campaign manager, Craig Smith, said he ordered the  
changes after talking with lawyers and considering his own feelings 
as a father. Smith's children helped work on Gore's ``Just for 
Kids'' pages. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is important that the vice president's office set a good  
example, so I commend them for making the changes,'' said Kathryn 
Montgomery, president of the Washington-based Center for Media 
Education. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC said Tuesday it doesn't consider a campaign Web site to  
be commercial, and thus subject to the new law. But some privacy 
groups suggested the law might apply to any site with a ``.com'' 
Web address, such as Gore's. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore recently drew ridicule when he said in an interview that he  
helped create the Internet, a remark he later blamed on being 
tired. He has been a strong supporter of federal spending to boost 
technology.

<HEADLINE> France Bank Takeover Bid Rejected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- The boards of French banks Societe Generale and  
Paribas voted Tuesday to reject a $37 billion hostile takeover bid 
by Banque Nationale de Paris, reiterating their confidence in plans 
for their own merger. 
</P>
<P>
	The dual rejections confirmed the banks' opposition to BNP's  
proposal, leaving the battle's outcome to shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Societe Generale and Paribas were completing a $17.2 billion  
friendly merger when BNP made its bid for both banks on March 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Societe Generale issued a statement Tuesday saying the premium  
offered by BNP would ``either be very small, or even negative,'' 
making it unattractive for its shareholders. In addition, it said 
that BNP's plan for a three-way merger would be ``neither as great, 
nor as certain'' as the benefits of a Societe Generale-Paribas 
link-up. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-way merger proposed by BNP would create a $1 trillion,  
world-leading banking group. 
</P>
<P>
	The struggle comes as European banks have been joining forces to  
better compete in a market transformed by the region's new common 
currency, the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	Societe Generale and Paribas have repeatedly pledged to fight  
the takeover attempt by BNP. In particular, Societe Generale said 
the significant overlap between its own and BNP's retail banking 
operations would automatically result in a drop in revenues if the 
three banks were to merge.

<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga.. (AP) -- Washington Avenue is not a good place to be  
driving in your car when U.S. amateur champion Hank Kuehne heads to 
the practice range. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been driving balls onto the street over an 85-foot fence  
some 285 yards away. The fence was put up to keep John Daly and 
Tiger Woods from being able to hit balls over it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing how far Hank hits it,'' British amateur champion  
Sergio Garcia said. ``He's at least 20 yards longer than I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials asked Kuehne to hit as few drivers as possible when he  
warms up to spare the cars. Finally they asked him to stop. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a little embarrassed,'' Kuehne said. ``I don't want  
anyone upset at me around here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kuehne, who can hit the ball 10-15 yards farther than Woods,  
impressed Arnold Palmer during a practice round on Wednesday, 
smashing a drive 310 yards on the first hole and leaving only a 
sand wedge to the green of the 410-yard Par-4. 
</P>
<P>
	``Arnie loved it the way I go after the ball,'' Kuehne said.  
``He told me to keep going after it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other amazing power displays by Kuehne this week included  
hitting the 500-yard, par-5 No. 15 with a driver and a wedge and 
hitting a driver over the towering trees down the left side of the 
485-yard, par-5 No. 13 leaving 105 yards to the green. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *A MESSAGE FROM GARCIA:* Sergio Garcia of Spain cleverly kept  
quiet about possible plans to turn professional after the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't tell you for sure,'' Garcia smiled. ``I have to speak  
with my father, who is caddying for me this week, and my family 
after the tournament is over. I'm just going step by step. We will 
see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia has been getting advice from Seve Ballesteros, whom  
Garcia calls ``like a second dad to me. He takes care of me and 
helps me out a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia said he hopes to finish in the top 18. The top 16  
finishers qualify for a return trip to the Masters in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Top 18 is my goal,'' he said. ``It's possible to win. But I  
would have to have the week of my life and do everything right. 
This is a great course and the greens are very fast. You have some 
almost impossible putts.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM:* Sam Snead, 86, winner of three Masters;  
Byron Nelson, 87, winner of two Masters; and Gene Sarazen, winner 
of one Masters, will be honorary starters for tournament play on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Snead, who played in 44 Masters, has been an honorary starter  
since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson, who played at Augusta 29 times, has been an honorary  
starter since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen, 97, played in 34 Masters and has been honorary starter  
since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	All three will hit drives down the first fairway then retire to  
the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SLOW AND EASY:* Masters competition committee chairman Will  
Nicholson admits play could be slower this year during the first 36 
holes because the tournament will be played in threesomes instead 
of twosomes until the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a par time of 4:38 last year and I think a substantial  
portion of the field could be through in about 4:40 this year,'' he 
said. ``There could be a few five-hour rounds late in the day from 
the last pairings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Masters was last played in threesomes in 1962.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HOT-HAND HUSTON:* Beware John Huston, who may be the hottest  
player in the Masters practice rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Huston led the Masters after the first round in 1997 when he  
holed out a 5-iron for eagle. On Tuesday, he holed another shot 
from the fairway. 
</P>
<P>
	In the final practice round Wednesday, Huston was 6-under over  
the last six holes to help him and Phil Mickelson beat David Duval 
and John Daly. 
</P>
<P>
	One observer had Huston at 62 for 18 holes.

<HEADLINE> Round-the-World Balloon Lands in DC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Smithsonian Institution's newest exhibit  
is as tall as the Tower of Pisa, as heavy as a fighter plane and 
inflates to the volume of seven Olympic swimming pools: the silvery 
hot-air balloon that carried two adventurers around the world in 20 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	The balloonists, Brian Jones and Bertrand Piccard, got a hero's  
welcome Wednesday at the National Air and Space Museum where their 
historic vehicle soon will be displayed alongside Charles 
Lindbergh's Spirit of St. Louis airplane, Orville and Wilbur 
Wright's 1903 flyer and the Apollo 11 command module from man's 
first mission to the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	The balloon, minus the hot air that makes it soar 181 feet, will  
be on display beginning in September. 
</P>
<P>
	The balloon, known as the Breitling Orbiter 3, will arrive at  
the museum after exhibits in Switzerland and London. The skin of 
the balloon, made of a thin, reflective synthetic material, will be 
displayed, but the main attraction will be the gondola. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-tech gondola -- about the size of two minivans -- has a  
bunk, toilet, kitchen area, control panel, oxygen and nitrogen 
tanks, solar panels, satellite phones and a fax machine. Quarters 
were tight, but the two say they did not have a cross word during 
their more than 26,500-mile ride on the jet streams. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't have to overcome nature ... we had to harmonize with  
the wind,'' said Jones, 52, a British pilot and balloon instructor. 
``We just had to put our capsule into a position where Mother 
Nature could just take us in her arms. It was a wonderful 
feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For their effort, Anheuser-Busch Cos. made good on its 1997  
pledge to give $1 million to the first balloon team to travel 
nonstop around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	The team will share half the money. The rest will be used to  
support humanitarian projects around the world, said Marie Bodman, 
president of Breitling U.S.A. Inc., part of a Swiss company that 
makes watches and precision instruments and sponsored the balloon 
excursion. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1984, eight ballooning teams, including five from America,  
have attempted the feat, museum director Donald Engen said. Jones 
and Piccard, 41, a doctor who specializes in psychiatry, were the 
first to succeed -- in 19 days, 21 hours and 47 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	They launched the balloon on March 1 in the Swiss Alps. They  
spent six days over the Pacific Ocean. High above the Gulf of 
Mexico, the weary flyers became poisoned by carbon dioxide, a gas 
from their exhaled breath that built up inside the cabin. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like a really bad attack of asthma,'' Jones said.  
</P>
<P>
	They started inhaling oxygen and changed the cabin's carbon  
dioxide filters. They were breathing fine by the time they crossed 
the Atlantic Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	The balloon landed March 21 in a desert in Egypt. Piccard opened  
the gondola hatch, put his feet in the sand and thought about Neil 
Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong was so happy to be so far away, Piccard said.  
</P>
<P>
	``We were so happy to put our footprint back on the Earth,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Edgerrin James Visits Eagles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Miami running back Edgerrin James realizes  
that the April 17 NFL draft will end one journey for him and begin 
another. 
</P>
<P>
	A part of him wishes the date was already past.  
</P>
<P>
	``You're just curious to find out what's going to happen,'' said  
James, who visited the Philadelphia Eagles on Wednesday. ``You just 
do all you can do, go out and show people what you're capable of 
doing as far as the combines and the meetings and everything, and 
it's up to them to make the decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles, who many believe are leaning toward drafting a  
quarterback with the second pick in the draft -- if they don't trade 
the pick -- were also preparing for a visit by Heisman 
Trophy-winning running back Ricky Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia already entertained quarterbacks Akili Smith,  
Daunte Culpepper, Donovan McNabb and Tim Couch, and team officials 
are said to consider all four potential ``franchise'' quarterbacks. 
The visits by James and Williams indicate the Eagles are, at the 
very least, keeping an open mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not surprised the Eagles showed this interest,'' said  
James, who left Miami after a junior year in which he rushed for 
1,416 yards, 17 touchdowns and averaged 5.9 yards per carry. ``If 
they look at my workouts and take into consideration my athletic 
ability, they can't rule me out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James has been in the long shadow of Williams all year, but he  
has no problem with that. He figures that once he reaches the NFL, 
things will change. 
</P>
<P>
	``We come from two different situations,'' James said. ``I come  
from the University of Miami, where there's no featured person. 
Everybody gets the ball. We have a lot of talent. Not to say Texas 
doesn't, but we don't showcase the running back and they did. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything will pan out once we get to the NFL,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, the Eagles entertained Washington Redskins tight  
end Jamie Asher, an unrestricted free agent. Asher caught 28 passes 
in an injury-shortened nine-game season in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a good fit if it happens,'' Asher said. ``I can  
get open and catch passes. That's what they want the tight end to 
do.''

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Plans New Windows Version </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft has postponed indefinitely its plans to  
merge its consumer-oriented Windows 95/98 operating system with the 
business-oriented Windows NT platform. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the company plans to release a new version based on the  
Windows 95/98 operating system, Microsoft president Steve Ballmer 
said Wednesday in a speech at the Windows Hardware Engineering 
Conference and Exhibition in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft officials had previously said that any new consumer  
versions of Windows would be built on the same technology as its 
Windows NT operating systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft postponed its goal of merging the two operating  
systems in order to respond to customer demand, spokesman Bill 
Zolna said. 
</P>
<P>
	The software giant has been struggling to produce its latest  
upgrade to Windows NT, now called Windows 2000. It originally was 
expected out in 1998, but is now more than a year late and is not 
expected out for several months. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft has a lot riding on Windows 2000, especially as  
competitors such as Linux are beginning to chip away at Microsoft's 
dominant market share. The massive and sophisticated network 
software program will be Microsoft's primary operating system for 
business and large-scale computing. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a transcript of the speech posted on Microsoft's  
Web site, Ballmer said Microsoft had hoped to have a consumer 
version built on the business platform by 2000, ``but we've decided 
to do the things that we all need to do to simplify the experience. 
The right approach next year is to continue to enhance the Windows 
98 product.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Features of the so-far unnamed new consumer version of Windows  
include a faster boot-up sequence and an improved ability to handle 
digital media, including images, movies and music, Zolna said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new operating system will be designed to simplify computers  
for users, something Ballmer referred to as an ``It Just Works'' 
concept. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft does not yet have a release date for the new consumer  
version of Windows, Zolna said.

<HEADLINE> GM's Sales Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. blamed a lean inventory of  
its hottest-selling vehicle, the full-size Chevrolet Silverado 
pickup, for a March sales performance that lagged behind most of 
its competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	GM said Wednesday that its U.S. sales were off 2 percent from a  
year ago -- lower than analysts had expected. While GM's car sales 
increased 1 percent, sales of light trucks were off 6 percent 
compared with the robust truck sales of March 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't a bad performance, but when you look at the  
competition, they had a much better month than GM did,'' said 
analyst Greg Salchow of Roney &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 1 automaker's report closed the books on a month that  
saw a surprisingly strong 8 percent increase in sales industrywide, 
despite GM's decline. For the first quarter, overall sales were up 
a robust 11 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I've seen this kind of quarter for about 10  
years,'' said Roy Roberts, GM's North American sales chief. ``It's 
really been a shock to all of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts noted that GM economists predicted sales this year would  
run between 15 million and 15.2 million light vehicles; in the 
first quarter, sales ran at a seasonally adjusted rate of 16.4 
million. Last year the industry sold 15.6 million cars and light 
trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past week, Ford Motor Co. reported its March U.S. sales  
were up 14 percent and DaimlerChrysler AG said its Chrysler unit 
posted a 17 percent improvement. Most major foreign automakers also 
reported strong gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately for GM, many buyers have been turning to Ford and  
Dodge dealers when they've been unable to get a new Silverado 
pickup equipped the way they want. The Silverado is all-new for 
1999, as is its GMC twin, the Sierra. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is virtually selling as fast as we can build it,'' Roberts  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though GM has plans to build 250,000 more trucks this year than  
last, that extra production has only recently begun to kick in. 
</P>
<P>
	While inventories of the more expensive Sierra are fine, GM says  
it has been unable to get stocks of the Silverado up to where it 
wants because of the strong demand. GM also has been hurt by a 
shortage of double-deck rail cars in Canada, where one of its three 
pickup plants is located, Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
	GM also sold about 10,000 fewer pickups to business, government  
and rental fleet customers last month than it did in March 1998, as 
it focused on meeting more profitable retail orders. A total of 
53,097 Silverados and 20,042 Sierras were sold last month. 
</P>
<P>
	GM said it has an inventory of about 155,000 full-size pickups,  
but needs between 165,000 to 175,000 to meet dealer needs. About 
30,000 of the current inventory are in transit to dealers. Roberts 
said he expected inventories to reach adequate levels in about five 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts said GM also sold fewer of its compact pickups last  
month because it declined to match the level of sales incentives 
offered by its competition, opting for higher profits over 
increased market share. GM's compacts also lack four-door versions 
that some competitors offer. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's U.S. market share last month was 29.5 percent, down from  
29.7 percent in February but ahead of last year's strike-effected 
29.1 percent. GM has started the year with the goal of gaining 32 
percent of the market, but that's appearing unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pushing to be north of 30,'' Roberts said.

<HEADLINE> Stock Prices Mixed; Dow Up 61.05 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Prices were mixed on Wall Street today as  
investors rewarded companies reporting strong first-quarter 
earnings but shied away from technology stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 61.05 at 10,024.54. Broader stock indicators were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks opened strongly as aluminum maker Alcoa released  
first-quarter earnings that soundly beat analysts' expectations. 
The good news from Alcoa, a component of the Dow, helped many 
blue-chips move higher. Alcoa itself was up 2 7/8 to 43 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T, another Dow stock, was up 4 1/4 at 84 3/8.  
</P>
<P>
	The financial sector was mostly higher as analysts said banks  
and brokerages have hinted they will report strong earnings when 
they begin releasing first-quarter results next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Ned Riley, chief investment officer at BankBoston, said  
investors may be rewarding those companies for weathering the 
global financial crises of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Chase Manhattan rose 4 7/8 to 84 1/8, and Merrill Lynch rose 4 1/2 to  
95 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	But computer companies held the market in check after Merrill  
Lynch analysts warned of some tough times ahead for the high-tech 
sector. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem, according to William Meehan, chief market analyst  
at Cantor Fitzgerald, is that stocks are too overvalued to 
withstand even the slightest hint of caution. ``It doesn't take 
much to trigger any kind of stampede,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Software maker Novell slipped 1 3/16 to 22 7/8, and Sun  
Microsystems fell 2 1/4 to 138 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, traders were optimistically looking ahead to an  
after-hours earnings release from Yahoo!, which was expected to 
beat analyst estimates. Yahoo! rose 11/16 to 215 9/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Revlon rose 3 3/8 to 23 3/8 after the cosmetics maker said it is  
considering the sale of one or more of its businesses.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Leader Touts Economic Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's economy is emerging from a  
prolonged crisis stronger than before, President Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso said in a published interview Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Brazilian economy is stronger than you think,'' Cardoso  
told the Jornal do Brasil of Rio de Janeiro. 
</P>
<P>
	The abrupt devaluation of its currency, the real, in January,  
failed to produce economic collapse or high inflation, as some 
economists predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were difficult moments ... few countries resist a blow  
like that,'' Cardoso said. ``What bank went under? What company 
went under? What country was contaminated? None.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the Banco Marka did go bankrupt. But the Central Bank  
sold it dollars at a subsidized rate to pay off its debts, allowing 
it to go under without alarming the market. 
</P>
<P>
	The widely criticized bailout is now a target of investigation  
by a Parliamentary Panel of Inquiry, or CPI, into the financial 
system and the Central Bank. The government had hoped to avoid such 
an inquiry, but Cardoso said there was nothing to hide. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to stop this mania of seeing risks in everything,'' he  
said. ``Right now, I don't see how a CPI about this endangers the 
currency or the Central Bank.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A second congressional inquiry into the judicial system is  
``more complicated,'' Cardoso admitted. The danger is that it could 
create a ``confrontation'' between the legislative and judicial 
branches, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardoso also denied rumors that he planned to replace Finance  
Minister Pedro Malan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Malan is a public servant, a correct man and doesn't abandon  
ship at a time of difficulty,'' Cardoso said. ``The government 
needs people like that. Malan is not leaving.''

<HEADLINE> Paper: Turkish Troops Enter N. Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- About 15,000 Turkish troops have crossed  
into neighboring Iraq to hunt down Kurdish rebels, a newspaper 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second reported cross-border offensive against  
Kurdish fighters based in northern Iraq since Turkish commandos 
captured Kurdish guerrilla leader Abdullah Ocalan on Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	The soldiers, accompanied by 2,000 pro-government village  
guards, crossed into Iraq on Tuesday and have penetrated some 9 
miles inside the country, the daily Cumhuriyet newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, Turkish warplanes pounded rebel bases in the  
northeastern corner of Iraq, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Military officials were not immediately available for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Turkey has frequently launched incursions into northern Iraq in  
the spring after the snow clears. Turkish Kurdish guerrilla 
fighters have bases in northern Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Guerrillas of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, an Iraqi Kurdish  
group, were aiding the Turkish soldiers, the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The KDP controls areas along the Iraqi-Turkish border and has  
sided with Turkey against the Turkish Kurdish rebels in past 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Rebels from Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, have been  
fighting for autonomy in the southeast of Turkey since 1984. Some 
37,000 people have died in the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan is awaiting trial on charges of treason and could face  
the death penalty if convicted.

<HEADLINE> Jackson Shifts Focus to Wall Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- After years of trying to shake things up in  
Washington, the Rev. Jesse Jackson is turning his attention to Wall 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The civil rights leader and his followers have bought token  
amounts of stock to get in the door at shareholder meetings of more 
than 200 companies nationwide. His goal is to push the companies to 
put minorities on their boards and invest in minority-owned 
enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
	``We go to them as shareholders, not sharecroppers,'' Jackson  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there's disagreement over how much effect Jackson can  
have, he turns heads at annual meetings, receiving warm applause 
and polite attention as he stands to ask questions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who is on our board of directors?'' he likes to ask. ``Who's  
managing our 401(k) and pension funds? Who is managing our 
portfolio?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The move puts the two-time presidential candidate on less  
familiar turf, but his Wall Street project has already brought 
results. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T, for example, has given a commitment to issue $1 billion in  
bonds through Blaylock &AMP; Partners L.P., a black-owned brokerage in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	And by some accounts, Jackson was instrumental in a deal  
announced this week in which Ameritech Corp. sold nearly half its 
cellular phone interests to GTE Corp. and a minority-owned investor 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	That group, Georgetown Partners, has contributed to the Jackson  
project and will help run the wireless subsidiary if the deal goes 
through. It will be the first black ownership in a 
telecommunications company, something the Federal Communications 
Commission has been seeking for years. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH Coalition will convene a conference next  
Thursday in Chicago. Participants include several Cabinet members, 
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and Arthur Levitt, chairman 
of the Securities and Exchange Commission, in addition to 
executives from American Express, Boeing and Ameritech. 
</P>
<P>
	And on Monday, Jackson plans to meet with executives in Silicon  
Valley, where his organization has bought about $70,000 worth of 
shares in 50 companies, including Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems 
and Apple Computer. 
</P>
<P>
	His biggest complaint is that of the 362 people now on those 50  
companies' boards, only 24 are women, five are black and one is 
Hispanic. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson noted that Apple has no blacks, Hispanics or women on  
its six-member board but uses black figures such as Miles Davis and 
Jackie Robinson in its ``Think Different'' marketing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``They, in fact, are not different,'' Jackson said of Apple.  
</P>
<P>
	Company officials declined to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies Research  
International, a high-tech consulting firm, said Jackson might have 
``a hard time calling any Silicon Valley company prejudiced'' 
because so many employees are of Asian descent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be surprised if he has any effect on these companies  
other than he gets their ear,'' Bajarin said. ``The bottom line is 
that we employ people that are absolutely skilled and trained.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But others say Jackson shows how shareholders can pressure  
companies to make changes. Shareholders need to own as little as 
$2,000 in stock to force a vote on a resolution. 
</P>
<P>
	``It puts the matter right in front of top managers so they have  
to deal with it,'' said Alisa Gravitz, vice president of the Social 
Investment Forum, a Washington-based nonprofit organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Co. now counts Jackson among its  
shareholders, and Coke spokesman Robert Baskin said Jackson is 
welcome to address its 12-member board, which includes one black 
and two women. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd love to have him,'' Baskin said.

<HEADLINE> LA Mayor: Our Schools Have Failed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Mayor Richard Riordan declared the nation's  
second-largest public school system a ``total failure'' and blamed 
its leadership Wednesday, a week before an important school board 
election. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two out of three kids cannot read at grade level by the end of  
third grade,'' the mayor said in his annual state-of-the-city 
address. ``This makes my blood boil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor faulted the board of the Los Angeles Unified School  
District for stressing ``feel-good'' subjects over basic math and 
reading skills. 
</P>
<P>
	Riordan also used the address to criticize secession efforts in  
the city, but focused on problems in the vast school district, 
which is governed by an elected, seven-member board that sets 
policy, establishes education programs and decides budget matters. 
</P>
<P>
	Brad Sayles, a spokesman for district Superintendent Ruben  
Zacarias, said the mayor got some of his facts wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a typical Riordan approach. He dwells on the negative,''  
Sayles said. 
</P>
<P>
	Third graders are behind in reading because of language issues,  
and not bad teachers, Sayles said. Many of the district's students 
are immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, four of the school board seats are up for election,  
and the mayor used his address to ask for support of candidates he 
is backing. 
</P>
<P>
	Riordan said the board tolerated incompetent principals, and  
despite the gaping failures of the system, no principal has been 
fired in the past 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``They call it the 'Dance of the Lemons,''' Riordan said. ``Bad  
principals don't get fired, they just get transferred around to 
other schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sayles said the comment showed the mayor's lack of understanding  
of the school system. In incompetence cases, principals are forced 
to resign under threat of demotion, Sayles said, and the difference 
between forced resignation and being fired is a matter of words. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dropout rates are down, attendance is up and more graduates go  
on to college than the national average,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	With almost 700,000 students in 668 elementary, middle and high  
schools, Los Angeles Unified is second only to the New York City 
school system. The district serves Los Angeles, 11 other cities, 
parts of 18 other cities and unincorporated county areas.

	Yugoslavia Closes Crossing Point  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslav authorities today closed  
the main exit route where a quarter-million ethnic Albanians have 
fled Kosovo, forcing tens of thousands of people back toward the 
reported carnage they left behind. Shutting the Morini border post 
apparently marked a policy reversal by Serb officials, who had 
conducted a campaign of mass expulsions of ethnic Albanians after 
the NATO bombing started last month. Macedonia today emptied a 
border enclave at Blace where tens of thousands of Kosovo refugees 
had been trapped for days in squalid conditions, taking 25,000 to 
NATO tent camps and shipping 10,000 others off to Albania.

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO stepped up its ``surgical''  
airstrikes after rejecting President Slobodan Milosevic's 
cease-fire declaration, while a Cypriot official said today he was 
close to arranging the release of three U.S. soldiers captured by 
Yugoslav forces. Sandy Berger, President Clinton's national 
security adviser, said he was aware of former Cypriot President 
Spyros Kyprianou's efforts to free the Americans but urged caution

Watergate-inspired law that provided for his job. In a statement, 
Starr confirmed that he would testify and said he looked forward to 
it. Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., who chairs the committee, has 
pledged to keep the hearings from focusing on Starr's 
controversial, five-year investigation of President Clinton, which 
led to his impeachment.

most populous nation. Setting the stage for talks with Chinese 
Premier Zhu Rongji, who is visiting the United States, the 
president defended his policy of engagement with China despite 
sharp differences on human rights, trade and weapons proliferation. 
Relations also have been soured by suspicions that China stole 
nuclear warhead secrets from the United States.

treatment for the mind-robbing disease that afflicts an estimated 4 
million Americans. One of the researchers, Dr. Dennis J. Selkoe, 
said scientists are ``very much on the road'' to a treatment. He 
said drugs designed to block the enzyme could enter clinical trials 
within three years. But some scientists questioned whether the 
research team had identified the actual enzyme or one that simply 
works in concert with it.

claiming unusually high itemized deductions are among those more 
likely to face an audit. The Internal Revenue Service audits less 
than 2 percent of the returns it receives and won't disclose 
precisely how it targets them. From the IRS standpoint, the only 
people who should fear an audit are those who are trying to cheat 
or those who don't have documentation for their deductions or other 
claims.

<HEADLINE> Mo. Keeps Ban on Concealed Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Missouri's residents have decided to  
keep the state's outlaw-era ban on carrying concealed weapons, 
despite a $3.7 million campaign by the National Rifle Association. 
</P>
<P>
	With 99 percent of votes counted early today, Proposition B,  
which would have lifted the ban, had failed 52 percent to 48 
percent, or 674,378 votes to 625,689 votes. Opponents said voters 
weren't swayed by the gun lobby's pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	``Missourians have said they just do not want guns carried into  
football games and bars and schools,'' said Harry Wiggins, a state 
senator from Kansas City who opposed the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The referendum on Tuesday was the first time a state had put the  
question of concealed weapons before voters. Thirty-one other 
states allow citizens to carry concealed guns, but those measures 
were enacted by legislators. 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri banned concealed weapons in a crackdown on gunslinging  
in 1875, when notorious bandit Jesse James was still at-large. He 
was shot to death seven years later in St. Joseph by a member of 
his gang. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Proposition B, state residents would have needed a second  
permit to carry a concealed weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	Applicants would have had to undergo criminal and mental health  
background checks, take at least 12 hours of state-approved 
training and have no violent offenses on their records for at least 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters said allowing law-abiding people to pack guns would  
keep the criminals guessing. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics said Proposition B would simply put more guns on the  
streets, and lead to more firearm violence because of lax 
requirements on training, eligibility and a permit applicant's past 
history of violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the measure was approved in 91 mostly rural counties,  
it failed by wide margins in St. Louis and Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly three out of four voters in St. Louis and a similar  
percentage in the city's suburbs rejected the proposal. In Jackson 
County, which includes Kansas City, 61 percent voted ``no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Myers, campaign manager for the leading proponents' group,  
Missourians Against Crime, complained about the forces arrayed 
against the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The foes included Democratic Gov. Mel Carnahan; Hillary Rodham  
Clinton, who taped telemarketing pitches calling Proposition B 
dangerous for families; top law enforcement officers and the 
editorial pages of leading newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	``How do you fight against the governor, first lady, the Justice  
Department?'' Myers asked. 
</P>
<P>
	The NRA tried -- paying for 700,000 mailings, 60,000 yard signs  
and huge advertising buys on television and radio.

<HEADLINE> Johnny Cash Returns to N.Y. Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- His voice clear and strong singing ``Folsom  
Prison Blues,'' Johnny Cash returned to the spotlight after a year 
of illness kept him from performing. 
</P>
<P>
	``My first time on stage in 19 months,'' Cash said Tuesday night  
at the climax of a concert that paid tribute to his work. ``It 
feels good, it feels good, it feels good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	TNT taped the all-star show, which featured Willie Nelson, Bruce  
Springsteen, Bob Dylan, U2, Sheryl Crow, Emmylou Harris and Wyclef 
Jean, for a special to air April 18. Cash's appearance in 
Manhattan's Hammerstein Ballroom was unannounced. 
</P>
<P>
	There was some question if he'd ever make it on stage again.  
Cash, 67, has Shy-Drager Syndrome, a rare neurological disorder 
that causes progressive damage to the nervous system. 
</P>
<P>
	All seven of Cash's children attended Tuesday's taping. His  
wife, June Carter Cash, sang ``Ring of Fire'' and remembered 
writing it with Johnny when they fell in love. ``He was kind of 
scary at that time,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Each performer paid sartorial tribute to ``The Man in Black'' by  
dressing in the color. 
</P>
<P>
	Near the show's end, the lights dimmed and actor Tim Robbins  
read a Cash essay about life in prison. The lights rose to reveal 
the author on stage, breaking into song after his traditional 
introduction: ``Hello, I'm Johnny Cash.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cash was tanned, his hair thinner since he last appeared in  
public. His baritone was sturdy as ever in singing ``Folsom Prison 
Blues'' and ``I Walk the Line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He gripped his wife's hand and briefly appeared to choke up on  
the line, ``I'll admit that I'm a fool for you.'' He stood with 
eyes closed to soak up the audience's standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow country renegade Nelson said the stage is where Cash  
needed to be. 
</P>
<P>
	``Get that bus warmed up,'' he said. ``The Highwaymen are ready  
to do it again if you are.''

	MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- A human rights group on Wednesday  
protested the inclusion of a member of a Miami-based Cuban exile 
group in a delegation representing Nicaragua before the United 
Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nicaraguan Human Rights Center said Luis Zuniga Rey was not  
``morally qualified'' to be part of the delegation to the U.N. 
Human Rights Commission in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
	The center's president, Vilma Nunez de Escorcia, said Zuniga's  
membership in the Cuban American National Foundation disqualified 
him because Cuba says group members funded and planned terrorist 
bombings in Havana. 
</P>

	MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- A U.S. insurance company has asked a  
Nicaraguan court to turn over a luxury plane stolen from Florida 
and later found to have been used by the nation's president. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacific Insurance Co. of Pennsylvania made the claim Tuesday  
in the 1st District Criminal Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane, a Learjet 35A, was reported stolen from B.L. Bennet  
Aviation in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., in December 1997. The insurance 
company's lawyer, Francisco Ortega Gonzalez, said his firm paid 
$2.3 million for the loss of the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	In May 1998, a national scandal broke out when it was discovered  
that the plane was in Nicaragua and had been used by President 
Arnoldo Aleman and Vice President Enrique Bolanos on official 
trips. Traces of cocaine also were found inside the plane.

<P>
	Aleman has said he had no idea the plane was stolen.

	Amalia Villatoro Argueta de Guinac, 32, was killed with a  
machete Tuesday in Retalhuleu, southwest of Guatemala City. Her 
three daughters and two sons, ages 6 to 14, also were slain. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators say whoever killed them was motivated by robbery.  
Argueta de Guinac had about $715 in profits from the family's corn 
crop.

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Puerto Rican rap singer William Jorge  
Brewley was arrested Wednesday for possession of heroin as he tried 
to board an airplane bound for Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Brewley, also known as the ``Godfather of  
Rap,'' had 6 1/2 pounds of heroin hidden in plastic bags in the soles 
of his sneakers, which had false bottoms. 
</P>
<P>
	Col. Manuel Verde Acosta of the National Guard's anti-drug unit  
said agents decided to search Brewley because he looked nervous 
while trying to board the flight at Simon Bolivar International 
Airport outside Caracas. His ultimate destination was Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	Juan Perez Aponte, who was traveling with Brewley, also was  
arrested on drug charges.

<HEADLINE> Steelworkers Angered Over Bonuses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Union employees of USX's U.S. Steel division  
are angry with what they call meager profit-sharing offerings and 
are urging a return to old-fashioned pay raises during contract 
talks set for later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	While the final sum has not been released, the presidents of  
United Steelworkers' locals have been told that full-time hourly 
employees can expect a bonus of about $360 each under their 
profit-sharing plan with the steelmaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Of that amount, $300 comes from a previous agreement that  
resolved an earlier profit-sharing dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Steelworkers say the paltry sum is insulting.  
</P>
<P>
	``We deserve more than $55 or $60,'' said Don Thomas, president  
of Local 1219 at the Edgar Thomson plant in Braddock. ``If that's 
what they think of their workers, we have a problem. I'm against 
any profit-sharing or bonuses. It's a joke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to steelworkers' irritation is USX chairman Thomas J.  
Usher's annual bonus of $1.2 million or more. His incentive pay is 
based on the performance of U.S. Steel and its sister company, 
USX-Marathon Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a 1993 labor agreement, union profit-sharing payments are  
based on pretax income after adjustments for such items as U.S. 
Steel's share of USX's overall debt costs. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Steel earned a $364 million net profit last year;  
profit-sharing checks for union workers are to be distributed by 
April 15. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997 U.S. Steel's net profit was $452 million; steelworkers  
each got $1,605. In 1996 they were given nothing based on a profit 
of $273 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Disgruntled workers say they have been duped by U.S. Steel.  
After 1996, the union took its complaint to arbitration and hired 
an accounting firm to audit U.S. Steel's financial statements. 
</P>
<P>
	After the audit, union officials concluded that they were  
getting what their contract required and accepted a settlement of 
an extra $500 last year and the additional $300 this year. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Steel spokesman Mike Dixon said the company has made  
profit-sharing payments eight times since the incentive was added. 
He said a glut of steel on the U.S. market last year cut profits 19 
percent from 1997's record pace. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Walt Lonce, president of Local 227 at the Irvin plant,  
said his members liken this year's proposed bonus to a ``smack in 
the face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he wants to get rid of profit sharing when the USW  
negotiates a new labor agreement with U.S. Steel. The current 
contract covering about 15,000 workers expires Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an embarrassment to send a check for $60,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> A Longer, Meaner Augusta National  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Augusta National has struck back,  
retaliating against graphite shafts, titanium drivers and souped-up 
golf balls with the most sweeping changes in the course's 68-year 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be a longer, meaner Augusta National meeting the  
challenge of star-wars golf technology when the Masters begins 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Pine trees have been planted, rough grown, tees moved back,  
bunkers reshaped, greens raised and mounds shaved in a new Masters 
examination of golfing skills. 
</P>
<P>
	The facelift, presided over by new Masters chairman Hootie  
Johnson, created instant criticism. Most players think that far 
from ``Tigerproofing'' Augusta National it has reinforced its 
reputation as a long-hitter's paradise. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17th hole in particular has been toughened. It's no longer a  
drive and a wedge 400-yard par-4. The tee was moved back 25 yards 
and pine trees planted left and right of the fairway. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Masters champion Gary Player said of the hole: ``Bobby  
Jones would turn over in his grave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, players could easily drive over the ``Eisenhower  
Tree'' at the edge of the left fairway and have a short iron to the 
green. Now, short hitters have to rifle the ball between Ike's tree 
on the left and the new pines on the right. 
</P>
<P>
	Players were caroming balls off the tree during practice and  
shaking their heads. 
</P>
<P>
	``They hit the tree and it's like a light bulb goes off over  
their head,'' said a spectator, watching the show. ``It's a harder 
hole now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Power hitters, however, may have a solution. John Daly pulled  
out his driver in a practice round, took a mighty swing and the 
ball cleared ``Ike's Tree'' on the 17th hole and landed some 300 
yards down the fairway. 
</P>
<P>
	President Eisenhower hated the pine tree that continually  
blocked his shots on the 17th fairway. He suggested one time that 
the offensive tree be sawed down. 
</P>
<P>
	Late chairman Clifford Roberts heard Eisenhower's complaint and  
replied by naming the tree ``Ike's Tree'' and ordering more 
fertilizer and water for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Modern technology and livelier golf balls made the tree a  
non-factor until the tees were moved back recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiger Woods, the 1997 Masters champion, smiles the smile of a  
sly young fox when he talks about the changes. He believes the 
``Tigerproofing'' has only served to help him. 
</P>
<P>
	``No. 17 in particular is a huge advantage for the long  
hitter,'' Woods said. ``The Eisenhower tree doesn't bother me. I 
just hit the ball over it without even thinking about it. The 
shorter hitters have to work the ball around the tree and probably 
hit 5-irons to the green.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six-times Masters champion Jack Nicklaus wishes officials hadn't  
given a facelift to golf's Mona Lisa. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told Hootie Johnson I wish he hadn't made them, but the  
changes he made are quite good,'' Nicklaus said. ``I like what they 
did on 17. It's played too short and too easy for too long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Mark O'Meara birdied No. 17 on the way to his  
Masters title last year. He said the hole now demands more respect. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't hit it over the top of the tree now,'' O'Meara said.  
``The course is longer now and it favors the longer hitters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Norman said changes on No. 17 made it a ``dogleg straight  
hole.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It definitely favors the longer hitter who can carry the  
tree,'' Norman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other changes:  
</P>
<P>
	--Moving the tee back 25 yards on the 575-yard, par-5 No. 2 and  
shifting a fairway bunker to the right. 
</P>
<P>
	--Raising the green 2 feet on the 455-yard, par-4 No. 11,  
removing two bunkers and creating a large bunker in the back. Rae's 
Creek to the left of the green was widened and raised a foot. 
</P>
<P>
	--Grading the mounds to the right of the 500-yard, par-5 No. 15,  
planting 20 pine trees on the right, removing the mound on the 
right of the green and planting six pine trees. 
</P>
<P>
	The course has been remeasured from 6,925 to 6,985 yards.  
</P>
<P>
	The rough is 1 3/8 inches high and will create devilish flying  
lies. It's still far below the 4-inch rough at the U.S. Open or the 
3-inch rough at the PGA. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rough creates a little uncertainty when you're playing the  
ball into the greens,'' Nicklaus said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said the changes were made to ``try to keep up with the  
world of golf. It's the most significant changes ever made at 
Augusta and we're just trying to stay in tune with the times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the motive for the changes was to ``require greater  
accuracy off the tee and put certain hazards back into play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Couples, the 1992 Masters champion, said the manipulations  
will raise scores. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody is going to shoot 18-under again like Tiger did,''  
Couples said. 
</P>
<P>
	His prediction for the winning score?  
</P>
<P>
	``Eight or 10-under will be a great score,'' he said. ``The  
course is really playing mean and tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just the way members at Augusta National want it.

<HEADLINE> World Bank: Global Crisis May Go On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The World Bank predicted Wednesday the global  
financial crisis may last longer than expected despite recent signs 
of recovery in Asia and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank, in a report assessing worldwide financial conditions,  
expressed concern about the possibility of protectionist trade 
policies if the U.S. economy falters, European markets fail to 
revive and Japan's recession deepens. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although there have been some encouraging signs of late with  
respect to recovery in Asia and in Brazil, we view this crisis as 
not over yet and we anticipate it will be more protracted and 
deeper '' than previously expected, said Uri Dadush, a senior bank 
official. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the bank wanted to warn against complacency as economies  
in Asia, where the crisis began 21 months ago, start to bounce 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	In Brazil, where the crisis spread late last year, stock markets  
are surging, the currency is stronger, inflation is lessening and 
investors are returning. 
</P>
<P>
	Dadush said the world economic growth ``has become extremely  
dependent on domestic demand in the United States,'' including a 
surging stock market. He described this dependence as ``not a 
healthy situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bank predicted that growth in the world's gross domestic  
product would rise by 1.8 percent, compared with 1.9 percent in 
1998. A 2.4 percent growth rate was forecast for 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said average growth rate in developing countries will  
be 1.5 percent in 1999, the lowest since 1982, and down from 1.9 
percent in 1998 and 4.8 percent in 1997. The bank predicted a 3.6 
percent increase in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank's sober forecast reflects declining trade growth,  
slumping prices for oil and other commodities, and a plunge in 
private, short-term capital investment to emerging economies, from 
$136 billion in 1997 to $72 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Lending by international financial institutions such as the bank  
and its sister institution, the International Monetary Fund, has 
increased. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank estimated that between July 1997, when the crisis  
began, and last December, the international community made 
available $190 billion in loans to Thailand, South Korea, 
Indonesia, Russia and Brazil. The countries have used $63 billion 
of that total.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Leader Seeks More Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- President Hugo Chavez has warned  
Congress may be dissolved and rejected a law giving him sweeping 
new powers, saying it doesn't go far enough. At the same time, his 
secret police chief arrested the son of a key opposition leader. 
</P>
<P>
	The former coup plotter turned president denies any political  
repression, but critics say Venezuela is descending into old-style 
Latin American authoritarianism. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez, 44, called reporters to the presidential palace late  
Tuesday to announce he was vetoing a law that would have given him 
broad powers to revive Venezuela's flagging economy. 
</P>
<P>
	He warned that Congress would be ``as good as dissolved'' if it  
tries to ``sabotage'' his efforts to get the economy back on track. 
A constituent assembly rewriting the constitution would dissolve 
it, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	As the president spoke, Congress convened an extraordinary  
session just blocks away to denounce the arrest this week of the 
son of Lewis Perez, secretary general of the Democratic Action 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are living with a government of persecution, of  
intimidation,'' Perez said a few hours before his 24-year-old son, 
Daniel, was released while authorities investigate what Chavez 
opponents say are trumped-up charges of illegal arms trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez insisted he had nothing to do with Daniel Perez's arrest  
and that his calls for greater powers are merely an attempt to 
honor his campaign promise to bring a ``social revolution'' to 
Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
	``Allow us to transform the country,'' he said. ``Our intentions  
are good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez, who took office in February, isn't the first Venezuelan  
president to ask for fast-track legislative authority. But because 
of his coup attempt seven years ago, the world is watching him more 
closely. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say the president, who enjoys widespread popularity  
among Venezuela's 23 million citizens, is sending ominous signals. 
</P>
<P>
	The army is taking on a greater role in society, with tens of  
thousands of soldiers traveling around the country to repair roads 
and tend to the sick. 
</P>
<P>
	Venezuelan Jewish leaders have expressed concern over Chavez's  
friendship with Norberto Ceresole, an Argentine writer who says the 
Holocaust never happened and espouses a ``leader-army-masses'' 
troika that excludes political parties. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez may have already bought into that idea, distancing  
himself even from his own party. On Tuesday, congressmen from his 
Fifth Republic Movement added their voices to the protests against 
Daniel Perez's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	State governors from many parts of the country have said the  
Chavez administration is angling to gain control over their budgets 
-- an affront, they say, to the ongoing process of decentralization. 
</P>
<P>
	And Chavez's rejection of the law allowing him to rule by decree  
for six months on issues ranging from tax collection to deficit 
reduction, was seen by some as just another power grab. 
</P>
<P>
	Time is running short for Chavez because of Venezuela's acute  
economic crisis, caused by a drop in world oil prices, the 
country's main export. This year's budget deficit is estimated at 
$8 billion, and hundreds of businesses have gone bankrupt, 
exacerbating unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez says his proposal to rewrite the constitution -- to be  
voted on in a referendum later this month -- will go a long way 
toward improving economic conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, he says, he needs far greater powers. The law  
approved by Congress 10 days ago was insufficient, he argues, 
because it failed to give him a mandate to renegotiate Venezuela's 
$22 billion foreign debt and to trim the bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Chavez's policies have been relatively market friendly,  
putting to rest the worst fears of investors. But analysts say 
Chavez's style could be a big drag on the economy by creating 
uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the president again conjured images of a Latin  
American strongman, stressing that he has the power to declare a 
state of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope Congress doesn't force me to do that,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Toxic Site Wrongly Declared Safe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	QUAKERTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- Federal investigators are examining a  
toxic dump that was mistakenly declared safe 18 years ago after 
inspectors went to the wrong site. Neighbors fear they were 
poisoned rather than protected. 
</P>
<P>
	The Environmental Protection Agency arrived here recently to  
examine the dump -- where 3,200 tons of paints, pigments and resins 
were buried in the late 1960s -- after activists brought the 
situation to its attention last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the EPA is trying to determine whether the 86 acres in  
Eastern Pennsylvania is a threat to groundwater and should be 
cleaned up. High levels of arsenic have been found in nearby 
drinking water, but it is unclear if the contamination was caused 
by the dump. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking at the groundwater in residential wells and soil  
at the site to see if the landfill is a danger to the community,'' 
EPA spokeswoman Ruth Podems said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	During the EPA's original probe in 1981, agency officials  
visited the wrong site because of what Ms. Podems called 
``misinformation'' from county records. The land was removed from a 
list of sites marked by the Superfund program as potentially among 
the nation's most polluted waste dumps. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Podems said the site doesn't appear to be particularly  
hazardous, but that is little comfort to Gerald Hardcastle, who 
lives a half-mile away. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardcastle recently found out his well has been contaminated  
with arsenic at 700 times the agency's risk level. The EPA said if 
consumed for many years, the water could pose an increased cancer 
risk. Hardcastle had been drinking the water since 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't know what was in that dump,'' he said. ``It could  
have been paint or anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The private dump, shut down in 1973, was once used by W.R. Grace  
Co., a Boca Raton, Fla.-based supplier of special chemical, 
construction and container products. In a celebrated case in 
Woburn, Mass., Grace paid $8 million to families who blamed 
polluted drinking water for the leukemia that killed their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal records show that a W.R. Grace subsidiary sent tons of  
paints and resins to the Pennsylvania dump in the late 1960s. 
Activists say there are no documents showing that the waste was 
ever removed. 
</P>
<P>
	Given that the EPA had to assess 20,000 dump sites nationwide at  
the time, Ms. Podems said it's not surprising that a mistake was 
made. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress gave us a tremendous task to find all the messes out  
there,'' she said. ``It's somewhat of a miracle that we got all the 
rest of them right.''

<HEADLINE> Scientists Claim Alzheimer's Enzyme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Researchers believe they have found a key enzyme that activates  
Alzheimer's, raising hopes of someday finding a treatment for the 
mind-robbing disease that afflicts an estimated 4 million 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the researchers, Dr. Dennis J. Selkoe, a neurologist at  
Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, said scientists are ``very 
much on the road'' to a treatment. He said drugs designed to block 
the enzyme could enter clinical trials within three years. 
</P>
<P>
	But some scientists questioned whether the research team had  
identified the actual enzyme or one that simply works in concert 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The case is far from nailed either way,'' said John Hardy of  
the Mayo Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers' findings were published in Thursday's issue of  
the journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Alzheimer's patients are known to have toxic plaques, or  
buildups, of amyloid beta proteins in their brains. 
</P>
<P>
	Selkoe, Michael S. Wolfe at the University of Tennessee, and  
others found evidence suggesting that a previously known brain 
substance called presenilin is the enzyme that controls production 
of amyloid beta proteins. Scientists previously believed presenilin 
played a role in Alzheimer's. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Sam Gandy, a New York University cell biologist who works  
with amyloid proteins, said the study offers ``very exciting and 
persuasive evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he cautioned that the enzyme and the chemical on which it  
operates must be purified and allowed to interact alone to be 
certain other unseen chemicals are not involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers also warned that presenilin may regulate other  
processes, such as the immune system, meaning that Alzheimer's 
drugs designed to inhibit presenilin could carry unwanted side 
effects.

<HEADLINE> Charges Dismissed in NYC Protests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Prosecutors dropped charges Wednesday against  
the 1,166 celebrities, politicians and other people arrested during 
15 days of protests over the police slaying of an unarmed West 
African immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Raymond Castello noted that the protesters were held  
for several hours after their arrest and said that was sufficient 
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	Amadou Diallo, a street vendor from Guinea, was killed Feb. 4  
outside his Bronx apartment when four white officers looking for a 
rapist fired 41 shots. The officers were charged last week with 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
	The slaying led to allegations of police brutality and racism.  
</P>
<P>
	Among those arrested during the demonstrations outside police  
headquarters were the Rev. Jesse Jackson, former Mayor David 
Dinkins, NAACP President Kweisi Mfume, and actors Ossie Davis, Ruby 
Dee and Susan Sarandon. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, a judge dismissed the trespassing and  
disorderly-conduct charges at the request of District Attorney 
Robert Morgenthau. Although the protesters blocked building 
entrances, prosecutors said they were nonviolent and cooperated 
with police. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Commissioner Howard Safir objected to the decision by  
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have the utmost respect for District Attorney Morgenthau,  
and in most instances, I agree with him,'' he said. ``This time, 
however, I do not.''

<HEADLINE> Former Cellmates Linked to Atheist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The 1995 disappearance of atheist leader Madalyn  
Murray O'Hair is looking increasingly like a murder case, and the 
arrests of two former cellmates on firearms charges may unlock the 
mystery. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the men is David Waters, a convicted murderer who was the  
office manager for Mrs. O'Hair's organization, American Atheists, 
before she, her son and granddaughter vanished along with $500,000 
in gold coins. 
</P>
<P>
	The other man, Gary Karr, has told investigators that he helped  
dispose of four bodies in Texas. One may be that of a man who 
disappeared after heading off to meet with Waters and discuss a 
deal with a lot of money. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI and prosecutors have not publicly linked either Karr or  
Waters to the O'Hair case. 
</P>
<P>
	But Waters' lawyer, Patrick Ganne, said Waters has been accused  
of being involved somehow in the disappearance, something Waters 
denies. Ganne said a federal prosecutor told him: ``Your client 
could get the death penalty. People are rolling over on your client 
and he better get right with God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. O'Hair gained fame in the 1960s, when she helped wage a  
Supreme Court battle that removed the Bible and prayer from public 
schools. She later tried to remove the phrase ``In God We Trust'' 
from U.S. currency and stop potential jurors from saying ``so help 
me God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Mrs. O'Hair, her son Jon Murray and her granddaughter Robin  
Murray vanished, authorities wondered whether the family had been 
the victims of foul play or had merely run off with their 
organization's money. Others suggested that Mrs. O'Hair, who was 77 
and ailing at the time, had gone off to die quietly so Christians 
wouldn't pray over her. 
</P>
<P>
	Several tantalizing leads went nowhere, though.  
</P>
<P>
	Then, Karr and Waters were charged last month with violating a  
law barring felons from having weapons. Karr was arrested after two 
loaded guns were found in his suburban Detroit apartment. Waters 
was picked up in Austin after 119 rounds were found in his 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	The break could come through Karr, 50, of Novi, Mich. He has  
admitted to helping dispose of four homicide victims in Texas, 
including one with its head and hands hacked off, FBI agent Bill 
O'Leary testified last month at a bail hearing for Karr. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Leary did not identify the four victims or mention the O'Hairs  
when he testified. 
</P>
<P>
	A headless, handless body was found in a ditch near Dallas in  
1995, and DNA testing identified it as that of con man Danny Ray 
Fry, a friend of Waters. Investigators and Fry's family say he had 
planned to meet Waters in Texas to work on a deal involving a lot 
of money before he disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Leary did say that Karr flew from Texas to New Jersey with one  
of the four homicide victims before money was wired from a Newark 
bank to Texas. The San Antonio Express-News reported that Jon 
Murray flew to Newark the week before he disappeared to expedite 
the wire transfer of $600,000 in atheist funds from New Zealand to 
San Antonio, via New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Leary did not say where the four bodies were buried.  
</P>
<P>
	But over the Easter weekend, the FBI and the Texas Department of  
Public Safety scoured a 5,000-acre ranch in Camp Wood, Texas, about 
100 miles from San Antonio, in a search a DPS spokesman said was 
connected to the disappearance of the atheists and the gold coins. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal agents would not say what they found.  
</P>
<P>
	Karr's lawyer, David Helfrick, would not comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Waters was convicted of beating a 16-year-old boy to death with  
a fence post in Illinois in 1964. He served 11 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	He quit as the office manager of American Atheists in 1993, just  
before he admitted stealing $54,000 from the group's accounts. 
Waters was given probation and ordered to repay the money. 
</P>
<P>
	Waters met Karr when the two were cellmates in Illinois. Waters  
was serving time for assaulting his mother and Karr was in for 
kidnapping and armed robbery. Waters was released in 1987, Karr in 
1995, four months before the O'Hairs disappeared.

<HEADLINE> Steelers Release Wolford </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Steelers released offensive  
lineman Will Wolford on Wednesday, a day after signing free-agent 
tackle Wayne Gandy to a four-year, $14 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolford, who played guard and tackle for the Steelers, had been  
considering retiring following his 13th NFL season, in which he 
played through a torn chest muscle. 
</P>
<P>
	He previously played for Buffalo and Indianapolis.  
</P>
<P>
	Wolford, 34, even had a retirement party this year but remained  
open to returning if the Steelers were not able to replace him. The 
release of Wolford, who made $2 million last year and had a cap 
value of $2.575 million, will bring the Steelers' back under the 
salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolford would have made $2.1 million in 1999-00.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, right tackle Justin Strzelczyk underwent his second  
knee operation in less than a year after reinjuring the right knee 
ligament he tore in October. He is expected to miss most, if not 
all, of the 1999 season following the surgery last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Strzelczyk had been expected to return and challenge former  
first-round draft pick Jamain Stephens at right tackle, only to be 
hurt while rehabilitating the knee for training camp.

<HEADLINE> Rodman, Actress Say Marriage is Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- It's back to the single life for Dennis  
Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	The eccentric basketball star and his actress wife, Carmen  
Electra, have decided to get a divorce after less than five months 
of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Carmen Electra and Dennis Rodman have announced that they have  
mutually agreed to end their ... marriage under amicable 
circumstances,'' publicist Matt Labov said Tuesday, speaking for 
both parties. ``Divorce papers were filed today in Los Angeles on 
behalf of Miss Electra. Miss Electra and Mr. Rodman are and will 
remain friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, 37, and Electra, 26, were wed in Las Vegas on Nov. 14  
after what was reported to be an all-night bender. Nine days later, 
Rodman claimed he was of unsound mind when he recited his vows and 
filed for an annulment. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the actress, whose real name is Tara Patrick, was with  
Rodman at Planet Hollywood in nearby Beverly Hills in February when 
he announced he was going to join the Los Angeles Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	During that news conference, Rodman said he and his wife were  
happily married, but living in separate homes, and Electra later 
attended several games to watch her husband play. 
</P>
<P>
	Then on March 13, Rodman received permission to leave the Lakers  
to resolve personal issues, and missed four games before rejoining 
the team in Orlando on March 21. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-time NBA rebounding champion, who has helped teams win  
five NBA championships, insisted the eight-day break had nothing to 
do with drinking, gambling, smoking or marital problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman later stated it was Electra who encouraged him to return.  
</P>
<P>
	Rodman was an instant hit with fans when he joined the team,  
helping the Lakers win nine straight games. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the team's play since he returned has been  
inconsistent. One of the lowest points came Saturday night when 
Rodman was ejected after picking up two technical fouls with 2:04 
remaining in an 81-76 loss to visiting Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman then grabbed 17 rebounds Monday night in a 117-104  
victory over Denver. Tuesday night, Rodman had 12 rebounds but did 
not score in a 106-93 loss to Utah.

<HEADLINE> China Telecom Broken Up Into 4 Cos. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China is breaking up the government's  
telecommunications monopoly into four specialized companies, a move 
that comes as U.S. and Chinese negotiators hold down-to-the-wire 
talks on China's bid to join the World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The long-awaited decision on the dismemberment of China Telecom  
would potentially open up a $28 billion market to foreign 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	China Telecom's tight grip on 95 percent of that market has been  
a major stumbling block in the WTO negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Before setting out on his current U.S. visit, Premier Zhu Rongji  
reportedly said China would allow foreigners to take up to 30 
percent stakes in telecommunications companies. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. negotiators trying to wrest concessions from China for an  
agreement on WTO membership during Zhu's visit want 50 percent 
foreign equity in telecommunications ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	China Telecom's vast operations will be divided into a  
traditional phone company, a mobile communications company, a 
paging company and a satellite communications company, the Ministry 
of Information Industry said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The breaking up of China Telecom is aimed at smashing the  
telecommunications monopoly in China and introducing competition to 
set up a fair and orderly market,'' Minister of Information 
Industry Wu Jichuan said in the statement, carried by the state-run 
Xinhua News Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	But industry analysts have questioned how much competition will  
be created by splitting one giant monopoly into what many see as 
four specialized monopolies. 
</P>
<P>
	A previous attempt to create a competitor to China Telecom has  
largely failed. China Unicom holds the other five percent of the 
Chinese telecommunications market, but has just $15.7 million in 
assets compared with China Telecom's $68 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	But since Chinese leaders consider information technology a  
crucial field for future prosperity and economic power, they have 
shown an interest in propping up China Unicom and welcoming more 
foreign investment in the sector. 
</P>
<P>
	The Xinhua report gave no time frame for the China Telecom  
break-up. Wu said new regulations for the telecommunications sector 
would be put in place in the first half of the year.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Drop Health Plans / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) -- Even though he has a wife, a  
1 1/2-year-old daughter and a job that can involve dangerous 
accidents, Clint Jacobs says he had no choice but to cancel his 
health insurance policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was too expensive, and we didn't get any coverage. We had  
some really high deductibles and there was no way of paying the 
premium,'' said Jacobs, 30, who raises 200 cattle on his ranch near 
Amidon, N.D. 
</P>
<P>
	Like most farmers and ranchers strangled by the sour farm  
economy, Jacobs has fallen victim to increasing agriculture 
concentration and new government trade policies -- not to mention 
floods, blizzards and other weather disasters. 
</P>
<P>
	Until he dropped the policy in September, he paid $550 every  
three months and had a $1,000 deductible for each member of his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs tries to avoid thinking about what would happen if he  
were injured in a car crash or fell seriously ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happens, happens,'' he said. ``We're broke anyway. What's  
a little more brokeness?'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for health care assistance from the government, some farmers  
and ranchers complain it is tailored to urban lifestyles and 
excludes needy farm families. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers, who are self-employed, generally pay much more for  
private health insurance than do people who join their employers' 
health insurance programs. 
</P>
<P>
	One rancher in northwest South Dakota who has a $4,500  
deductible said he worries every day that an accident or illness 
will bankrupt him, his wife and their baby. The family of three 
pays more than $6,000 a year on health insurance premiums because 
one member is epileptic and another is diabetic. 
</P>
<P>
	Although his ranch is not making money, he, too, is ineligible  
for government health care assistance, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you've got any machinery, that's a liquid asset,'' said the  
rancher, who did not want to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	In a recent survey of 82 farmers and ranchers, 26 said they had  
to drop their health insurance to make ends meet, said Sandra 
Simonson Thums, a rural specialist with Lutheran Disaster Response 
and Lutheran Social Services of North Dakota, which conducted the 
survey. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-four respondents said they cannot sleep at night and 36  
said financial problems have caused stress in their marriages. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have four or five bad years and you tighten the belt  
every time, health insurance gets to be one of the things,'' Thums 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Long, chief executive of West River Regional Medical Center  
in Hettinger, N.D., a nonprofit hospital that treats mostly rural 
people, said patients have begun to skip important preventative 
care like mammograms, prostate screenings and physicals. Doctors 
sometimes do not charge for treatment and hand out medicine free. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our amount of uncompensated care is continuing to increase at  
significant rates,'' Long said. ``Sometimes we take ridiculous 
payment plans, like $10 a month on a bill that would take 30 years 
to pay off. In some cases, we don't get paid at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Self-employed workers can deduct up to 45 percent of their  
medical payments when filing tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
	New legislation will help farmers and ranchers some by allowing  
the self-employed to deduct 60 percent of medical costs on their 
1999 and 2000 taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, which was attached to the omnibus spending bill  
President Clinton signed in October, makes medical costs for the 
self-employed fully deductible starting in 2003.

<HEADLINE> Tube Talk: `Homicide' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- They left not knowing if they would ever  
return, not knowing whether ``Homicide'' was doomed ... or might 
cheat death once again. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't the first time that the cast and crew of NBC's  
6-year-old crime drama had wrapped for one season unsure if they'd 
be back for the next. That's how things go when a groundbreaking, 
celebrated TV series clings to third place in its time slot (Friday 
at 10 p.m. ET), logging fewer viewers than an ABC newsmagazine and 
that CBS cop show with the guy who used to be married to Melanie 
Griffith. 
</P>
<P>
	March 11 marked completion of the season's 22nd episode of  
``Homicide: Life on the Street.'' Then everything shut down until 
summer, when filming begins for an eighth season. If it does. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to find out if it will, Tom Fontana, executive producer  
of the series, has been heating up the phone lines from his office 
in Manhattan to the Burbank, Calif., number of NBC West Coast 
president Scott Sassa, who will render the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said to Scott, 'When do you think I'll know?''' Fontana  
mentioned recently. ``He said, 'Well, definitely by May 17.''' No 
kidding. That's the day NBC unveils its fall schedule to the world. 
</P>
<P>
	So Sassa's message may not seem like a rousing declaration of  
support, especially since NBC already has announced a Fall '99 
pickup of nine other incumbent series including ``3rd Rock From the 
Sun,'' ``Providence'' and ``Just Shoot Me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of uncertainty,'' sighed Richard Belzer, a  
charter member of the ``Homicide'' cast who plays sardonic Det. 
John Munch. As he spoke, he was sitting in the squad room between 
setups a couple of days before the season wrap. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the 5,000-pound elephant in the corner,'' he said,  
referring to the question of the show's future. ``Of course, we 
talk about it!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``No, people don't talk about it,'' said Peter Gerety, a  
relative newcomer to the ensemble, seated across the room at the 
desk of his character, Det. Stuart Gharty. ``I have so much love 
for this show, but once you've said, 'Gee, I hope it comes back,' 
what else do you say?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cluttered and institutional-looking, the squad room set exists  
(for now) inside the hulking brick building known to any 
``Homicide'' viewer as the waterfront headquarters of the Homicide 
Unit. This landmark of Baltimore's Fells Point section also houses 
the production company for the show, as it has since the series 
premiered in January 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, ``Homicide'' has remained a brazen and courageous  
work-in-progress, sometimes knockabout and menacing, sometimes 
crisp and cool, sometimes simply breathtaking -- and never like 
anything else on TV. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the series -- based on a book by former Baltimore Sun  
crime reporter David Simon and spearheaded by director Barry 
Levinson, a native son -- has sunk its roots into Baltimore's soil, 
becoming part of the city it portrays. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, on Sunday, March 7, the show's cast staged the  
fifth annual ``Homicide Live'' at a Baltimore theater to benefit 
local arts groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Kyle Secor, who on ``Homicide'' plays Zen-blissful, bisexual  
Det. Tim Bayliss, served as artistic director as well as its 
rollicking host. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you know you people represent our entire viewing  
audience?'' he greeted the wildly enthusiastic crowd. ``Oh, yeah! 
I've got you all here!'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a variety show it was strictly by the seat of the pants, and  
all the more endearing for it. Nearly everyone took part. Toni 
Lewis (Det. Terri Stivers) wowed the audience with a charmingly 
naughty torch song. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Clark Johnson (Det. Meldrick Lewis) took bird-call  
requests. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oriole,'' someone yelled out.  
</P>
<P>
	``Oreo!'' Johnson huffed comically. ``Who you callin' an  
Oreo?!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belzer, a master of stand-up comedy, strutted his sarcastic,  
largely unprintable stuff. ``You're from Philadelphia?'' he scoffed 
at one audience member. ``You ever gonna fix that (bleeping) 
bell?'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Callie Thorne (Det. Laura Ballard) sang a  
``Homicide''-tailored version of the Rolling Stones' ``Beast of 
Burden,'' complete with a plaintive reprise: ``Pick us up! For one 
more sea-son!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, she was seated at Ballard's desk, wondering about  
that much-desired pickup. 
</P>
<P>
	``The feeling changes every day,'' Thorne said. ``Today, I think  
we'll be back. But sitting here at this desk, I'm also thinking, 
'Maybe this will be the last time.''' She fingered one of the 
keepsakes belonging to her character, a transplanted Seattleite. 
``My Space Needles ...,'' Thorne murmured. 
</P>
<P>
	That week's issue of Variety lent no comfort. ``If NBC finds the  
right family-friendly companion to `Providence,' the web will 
probably pull the plug on `Homicide.''' 
</P>
<P>
	But there was no confirmation on that, or much else, from Scott  
Sassa. ``It's early in our development season,'' he said in a 
recent phone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Development is the process in which producers pitch ideas,  
networks order scripts, and studios shoot pilots, all in the hope 
that, among dozens of contenders, your project gets a network's 
go-ahead -- and becomes a hit series. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the dramas vying for a slot in NBC's 1999-2000 lineup are  
``Chaos Theory'' (three sisters and their family in a college 
town), ``Cold Feet'' (three thirtysomething couples) and ``The 
Others'' (paranormal thriller about a college freshman with psychic 
powers). If chosen, any of these or the other candidates might push 
out ``Homicide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not that Sassa didn't praise the show, ``but we are concerned  
that the ratings aren't a little higher.'' For the 1998-99 season 
so far, ``Homicide'' has averaged 10.37 million viewers, while CBS' 
Don Johnson actioner ``Nash Bridges'' draws 12.5 million and ABC's 
``20/20'' wins the hour with 14 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to say how to improve it,'' Sassa added. ``So it's  
hard to say how the ratings can improve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only recently named the top programmer at NBC (a network still  
in first place but struggling to stay there), Sassa has a lot at 
stake. Could it be he doesn't share his predecessors' loyalty to 
``Homicide,'' that Nielsen problem child? 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Fontana doesn't buy such a theory. He countered that his  
series' problem, if it has one, extends beyond any one exec. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the whole business is changing,'' Fontana said. ``It  
isn't just about NBC in relation to `Homicide.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Eroding audiences. Sinking revenues. Escalating competition.  
Unimaginable threats just over the horizon. This is the lament of 
broadcast networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Can ``Homicide'' keep its foothold on this changing landscape?  
What will be the fate of this excellent and edgy series born in a 
more obliging era -- and living on the edge ever since? 
</P>
<P>
	Anxious fans of ``Homicide'' wait for any word. So do its actors  
and writers and grips. 
</P>
<P>
	So does Fontana. ``I love doing the show,'' he said. ``I always  
want another chance to do it better.''

<HEADLINE> Photos Could Cost Ohio Couple </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LIMA, Ohio (AP) -- Virginia and Henry Otto say they are so used  
to cars careening off the road near their home that they have 
developed a routine. 
</P>
<P>
	First they call 911, then check the victim and grab a camera to  
take pictures in case they need to file an insurance claim over the 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	But their most recent photos have them facing charges of  
interfering with paramedics and officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident happened early Sunday when a car ran a stop sign  
and hit a gas meter early Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff Dan Beck said Mrs. Otto was told to stop taking pictures  
because the flash could ignite the leaking gas. Mrs. Otto didn't 
comply and a deputy grabbed her camera and accidentally broke the 
flash, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Otto said she must have misunderstood the deputy.  
</P>
<P>
	``If I knew he was going to be that infuriated, I surely  
wouldn't have done it,'' she said. ``It's not that I willfully 
disobeyed that man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Otto said her husband was arrested after he questioned the  
seizure of her camera. 
</P>
<P>
	He was charged with persistent disorderly conduct and misconduct  
at an emergency. His wife was charged with obstructing official 
business and misconduct at an emergency. Both pleaded not guilty on 
Monday.

<HEADLINE> GM's Sales Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. blamed a lean inventory of  
its hottest-selling vehicle, the full-size Chevrolet Silverado 
pickup, for a March sales performance that lagged behind most of 
its competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	GM said Wednesday that its U.S. sales were off 2 percent from a  
year ago -- lower than analysts had expected. While GM's car sales 
increased 1 percent, sales of light trucks were off 6 percent 
compared with the robust truck sales of March 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't a bad performance, but when you look at the  
competition, they had a much better month than GM did,'' said 
analyst Greg Salchow of Roney &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 1 automaker's report closed the books on a month that  
saw a surprisingly strong 8 percent increase in sales industrywide, 
despite GM's decline. For the first quarter, overall sales were up 
a robust 11 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I've seen this kind of quarter for about 10  
years,'' said Roy Roberts, GM's North American sales chief. ``It's 
really been a shock to all of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts noted that GM economists predicted sales this year would  
run between 15 million and 15.2 million light vehicles; in the 
first quarter, sales ran at a seasonally adjusted rate of 16.4 
million. Last year the industry sold 15.6 million cars and light 
trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past week, Ford Motor Co. reported its March U.S. sales  
were up 14 percent and DaimlerChrysler AG said its Chrysler unit 
posted a 17 percent improvement. Most major foreign automakers also 
reported strong gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately for GM, many buyers have been turning to Ford and  
Dodge dealers when they've been unable to get a new Silverado 
pickup equipped the way they want. The Silverado is all-new for 
1999, as is its GMC twin, the Sierra. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is virtually selling as fast as we can build it,'' Roberts  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though GM has plans to build 250,000 more trucks this year than  
last, that extra production has only recently begun to kick in. 
</P>
<P>
	While inventories of the more expensive Sierra are fine, GM says  
it has been unable to get stocks of the Silverado up to where it 
wants because of the strong demand. GM also has been hurt by a 
shortage of double-deck rail cars in Canada, where one of its three 
pickup plants is located, Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
	GM also sold about 10,000 fewer pickups to business, government  
and rental fleet customers last month than it did in March 1998, as 
it focused on meeting more profitable retail orders. A total of 
53,097 Silverados and 20,042 Sierras were sold last month. 
</P>
<P>
	GM said it has an inventory of about 155,000 full-size pickups,  
but needs between 165,000 to 175,000 to meet dealer needs. About 
30,000 of the current inventory are in transit to dealers. Roberts 
said he expected inventories to reach adequate levels in about five 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts said GM also sold fewer of its compact pickups last  
month because it declined to match the level of sales incentives 
offered by its competition, opting for higher profits over 
increased market share. GM's compacts also lack four-door versions 
that some competitors offer. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's U.S. market share last month was 29.5 percent, down from  
29.7 percent in February but ahead of last year's strike-effected 
29.1 percent. GM has started the year with the goal of gaining 32 
percent of the market, but that's appearing unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pushing to be north of 30,'' Roberts said.

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- British Airways plans to start flying to Libya now  
that the United Nations has suspended sanctions against that 
country, which on Monday handed over two Libyans suspected of 
blowing up a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	The flights between London and Tripoli, the Libyan capital, are  
to begin later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline, which has never flown to the Libyan capital before,  
said Wednesday it plans three flights a week using Boeing 737 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	After years of haggling, Libya agreed to surrendered the  
suspected terrorists for trial in the Netherlands under Scottish 
law.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Ground Troops Gaining Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even as the Clinton administration keeps  
vowing not to add U.S. ground troops to the NATO airstrikes in 
Yugoslavia, momentum in Congress appears to be shifting in favor of 
such an option as a fast-approaching last resort. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you are in a war, you are in to win,'' said Sen. Chuck  
Hagel, R-Neb., one of a group of 13 lawmakers who began a visit to 
Europe today with Defense Secretary William Cohen for NATO 
consultations on the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Hagel, a Vietnam veteran and member of the Senate Foreign  
Relations Committee, said his views come despite the fact that most 
of the constituents he has heard from are opposed to U.S. 
involvement in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm convinced that our leadership and the leadership of NATO  
felt that Milosevic would fold up after a substantive air 
campaign,'' Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo., another member of the 
delegation, said in an interview. ``But he hasn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Skelton, senior Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee,  
said he participated a few years ago in an Air Force study of the 
Persian Gulf air war, ``and the bottom line was, you can't win with 
just an air campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You need ground forces,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	However, House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt said Tuesday that  
discussion of ground troops was ``irrelevant at this point. NATO 
hasn't asked for them, the president hasn't asked for them,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we ought to say no ground troops,'' said  
Gephardt, R-Mo. But, ``I don't think you speak on that until it's 
asked, and no one's asked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Congress began its two-week spring recess on March 26,  
there was overwhelming opposition to using ground troops for 
anything other than enforcing a peace agreement, particularly among 
majority-party Republicans. And even support for that was narrow. 
</P>
<P>
	On March 11 the House, on a 219-191 vote, passed a resolution  
authorizing U.S. involvement in a NATO ground force -- but only to 
enforce a peace agreed to by both sides. The Senate voted 58-41 on 
March 23 to support airstrikes only, after Serbs spurned peace 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers had expected to return to Washington next week to  
grapple with the federal budget, Social Security, Medicare and 
other domestic priorities. Instead, they've got an undeclared war 
on their hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional officials said the administration was planning a  
series of briefings for lawmakers when Congress returns. The 
president is tentatively expected to host the top leaders at the 
White House on Monday night, and a larger group on Tuesday. 
Officials will be dispatched to the Capitol to provide information 
to rank-and-file lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two weeks ago, the United States had several very good options  
for dealing with the problem in Kosovo, '' said Rep. Christopher 
Cox, R-Calif., chairman of the House Republican Policy Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, there are none,'' Cox added. ``The bombing campaign  
with no 'Plan B' has left the United States very visibly 
responsible for the acceleration of misery in Kosovo. It is 
impossible now for President Clinton to fail without the United 
States failing as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ellen Tauscher, D-Calif., a member of the House Armed  
Services Committee, said in an interview that she looked forward to 
the trip with Cohen so she could look NATO military planners in the 
eye ``and see what their sense of the situation is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been increasingly concerned over the past ten days that  
ground forces may be necessary. I'm very interested in seeing where 
we are,'' Tauscher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen and the bipartisan group of lawmakers also planned to  
visit with some U.S. forces in the region on Thursday, including 
those stationed at Aviano Air Base in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a senior member of the Senate Armed  
Services Committee and a 2000 GOP presidential aspirant, has been 
outspoken among Republicans in recently urging Clinton not to rule 
out the use of ground forces. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are in it; now we must win,'' says McCain, a Navy fighter  
pilot who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam for 5 1/2 years. He also is 
traveling with Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John Warner, R-Va.,  
suggested the capture and imprisonment of the three American 
soldiers and the mounting refugee crisis had upped the stakes. 
``It's not just the credibility of NATO, it's the credibility of 
the United States in other very troubled areas of the world,'' said 
Warner. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Dick Lugar, R-Ind., a senior member of the Foreign  
Relations Committee, and Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, the senior 
Democrat on that panel, both have suggested recently that the 
Clinton administration's refusal to consider ground troops was a 
mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the apparent shift in sentiment, many lawmakers still  
oppose sending troops to the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., asked House Speaker Dennis Hastert,  
R-Ill., to convene a special session of Congress this week to 
consider such a vote. Campbell claims Clinton has exceeded his 
authority to use military force in Kosovo -- and that only Congress 
can make such a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Hastert had no plans to call Congress back before it  
returns next Monday, aides said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president has said he is not considering the use of ground  
troops. This should remain the case, ``particularly given the way 
the operation in the Balkans has been managed to this point,'' said 
Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo.

<HEADLINE> 3Com Nude Ad Under Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Some women are calling a high-tech  
company's advertisement displaying a nude woman sexist and a 
transportation agency has banned the ad from bus shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3Com Corp. ad features a photograph of a naked woman curled  
up in a fetal position while holding a Palm V hand-held electronic 
personal organizer. The ad, which shows no private body parts, is 
on 20 billboards and dozens of bus shelters in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar ads are running in Newsweek and Conde Nast Traveler  
magazines. 
</P>
<P>
	``It stereotypes the role of women as the object of desire, not  
just in selling liquor or pantyhose but computers,'' said Sylvia 
Paull of GraceNet, a group of San Francisco Bay area women who work 
in technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority refused to put  
the ads on bus shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt our overall ridership would not respond positively to  
its artistic intent,'' spokeswoman Doreen Moreno said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with Santa Clara-based 3Com argued the ads are  
tasteful, although more typical of tobacco and alcohol companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you wanted to be sexist, you'd have her like those images  
in car ads, slithering across the hoods,'' said David Hunter, of 
Foote, Cone &AMP; Belding, the firm that created the ads. 
</P>
<P>
	The ads have become popular fodder for parody on the Internet.  
One Web designer posted four salacious photographs of women holding 
the new Palm V under the title ``Simply Porn.'' He posted the mock 
ads next to a copy of 3Com's ad, which the company later ordered 
him to remove.

<HEADLINE>  Ford, Dole Criticize Kosovo Tactics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Miscalculations by the White House have made the use of ground  
troops in Kosovo the only option short of NATO's defeat, former 
President Ford said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration overemphasized the power of  
airstrikes and underestimated the magnitude of the humanitarian 
crisis, Ford said in a telephone interview from his home in Rancho 
Mirage, Calif. ``The net result is they have two choices,'' he 
said. ``One choice is to go all-out and win the war with ground 
troops, or two, to quit and admit defeat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Continuing on the current course ``I don't think is going to do  
anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The air campaign drew a mixed review Wednesday from former Sen.  
Bob Dole, who served President Clinton as an envoy in Yugoslavia. 
Dole said the effort was suffering from poor preparation but 
appeared finally to be achieving some goals. 
</P>
<P>
	He said in an interview he cannot understand why it is taking so  
long to get Apache helicopters in place and it appears military 
leaders are generally running into some political interference. He 
also questioned why Clinton would rule out ground troops -- 
``telegraph your punches'' -- at the outset of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I support the general effort,'' Dole said. ``I think it comes  
years too late and I kind of hoped we'd been better prepared. A lot 
of ... just basic preparation wasn't done. But that's history and 
we have to deal with where we are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The air attacks, he said, are ``beginning to have an impact''  
even if the effort ``is not quite as rapid or intense as some of us 
had hoped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford, who has not often commented on Clinton's policies, said he  
told Vice President Al Gore when they talked at the beginning of 
the air campaign that he would publicly support the president's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the interview, the former Republican president said the  
Kosovo mission was a humanitarian one, not a matter of national 
security for the United States until its forces got involved. He 
hoped Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic could be persuaded to 
let NATO forces in to monitor the return of displaced ethnic 
Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would just hope that the threat of NATO air and ground  
operations would shock him into doing what's right,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As special emissary for Clinton, Dole helped bring the ethnic  
Albanians over to supporting an agreement, which the Serbs refused 
to endorse. The Serb refusal led to the NATO bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole was also instrumental, as Senate majority leader, in  
helping Clinton win Republican congressional approval for sending

<HEADLINE>  Ford, Dole Criticize Kosovo Tactics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Miscalculations by the White House have made the use of ground  
troops in Kosovo the only option short of NATO's defeat, former 
President Ford said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration overemphasized the power of  
airstrikes and underestimated the magnitude of the humanitarian 
crisis, Ford said in a telephone interview from his home in Rancho 
Mirage, Calif. ``The net result is they have two choices,'' he 
said. ``One choice is to go all-out and win the war with ground 
troops, or two, to quit and admit defeat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Continuing on the current course ``I don't think is going to do  
anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The air campaign drew a mixed review Wednesday from former Sen.  
Bob Dole, who served President Clinton as an envoy in Yugoslavia. 
Dole said the effort was suffering from poor preparation but 
appeared finally to be achieving some goals. 
</P>
<P>
	He said in an interview he cannot understand why it is taking so  
long to get Apache helicopters in place and it appears military 
leaders are generally running into some political interference. He 
also questioned why Clinton would rule out ground troops -- 
``telegraph your punches'' -- at the outset of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I support the general effort,'' Dole said. ``I think it comes  
years too late and I kind of hoped we'd been better prepared. A lot 
of ... just basic preparation wasn't done. But that's history and 
we have to deal with where we are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The air attacks, he said, are ``beginning to have an impact''  
even if the effort ``is not quite as rapid or intense as some of us 
had hoped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford, who has not often commented on Clinton's policies, said he  
told Vice President Al Gore when they talked at the beginning of 
the air campaign that he would publicly support the president's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the interview, the former Republican president said the  
Kosovo mission was a humanitarian one, not a matter of national 
security for the United States until its forces got involved. He 
hoped Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic could be persuaded to 
let NATO forces in to monitor the return of displaced ethnic 
Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would just hope that the threat of NATO air and ground  
operations would shock him into doing what's right,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As special emissary for Clinton, Dole helped bring the ethnic  
Albanians over to supporting an agreement, which the Serbs refused 
to endorse. The Serb refusal led to the NATO bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole was also instrumental, as Senate majority leader, in  
helping Clinton win Republican congressional approval for sending 
ground troops to Bosnia to support the peace agreement reached in 
late 1995, just as the two men were preparing to go head to head in 
the 1996 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to start second-guessing,'' Dole said of the NATO  
effort, acknowledging decisions unavoidably take time when 19 
member countries are involved. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said plans should have been made at least to permit rapid  
deployment of Apache helicopters, said to be capable of closely 
engaging Serb units too scattered or small for bombers. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said it may take a week to put the German-based  
Apaches in use because of strains on air transport caused by 
humanitarian flights and the complex support units required by the 
helicopters.

<HEADLINE> NATO To Introduce Attack Choppers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After two weeks of bombing by high-flying  
jets, NATO is about to introduce into the Yugoslav air campaign the 
Apache helicopter gunship, one of the Army's most versatile killing 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding Apaches marks an escalation of NATO's war effort but also  
deepens the risk to American pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they go in aggressively -- which they will, because that's  
what they do -- then we're going to take losses,'' said retired Army 
Col. Harry Summers, an analyst who has written extensively about 
military affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The only allied plane that has gone down on Yugoslav territory  
since the start of the conflict was a U.S. Air Force F-117A stealth 
fighter-bomber on March 27. The Pentagon won't say what caused it 
to crash, but defense officials said privately it probably was hit 
by a surface-to-air missile. The pilot ejected and was rescued -- a 
happy ending less likely in the event an Apache goes down. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO already is using a wide variety of planes to strike  
military targets in and around Kosovo, but the Apache is more than 
just another aircraft. Designed to fly the ``nap of the earth'' -- 
just a few feet off the ground -- the Apache operates ``up close and 
personal'' with enemy troops, as Army pilots like to say. Some 
liken the attack helicopter to flying artillery, with the added 
edge of operating at night. 
</P>
<P>
	Apaches, flown with a crew of two, are armed with as many as 16  
Hellfire missiles designed to knock out tanks and other armor, as 
well as 70mm rockets that can be fired at a rate of 625 rounds per 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Using the heavily armed Apaches in Kosovo brings a new dimension  
to the conflict. It provides a greater opportunity for NATO to 
knock out Serb armor and disrupt assembly areas but also a greater 
chance that the Serbs will score successes with their thousands of 
anti-aircraft guns, which have been ineffective against the faster, 
higher-flying NATO fighters and bombers in action since March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	The threat to Apache helicopters is especially great because  
they fly low, well within range of shoulder-fired guns and 
anti-aircraft artillery that are deployed throughout Kosovo with 
Serb army units. 
</P>
<P>
	``For these Apache pilots to do the job they are going to have  
to get down and dirty,'' Summers said. That means coping with an 
air defense system that is considered the strength of the Serb 
military. 
</P>
<P>
	With the first word last week that the United States was  
offering to add Apaches to NATO's air armada, some said this marked 
the first step toward U.S. involvement in a ground war in Kosovo. 
The Clinton administration firmly denies this, stressing that none 
of the 2,600 soldiers expected to deploy to Albania with the 24 
Apaches will step foot in Yugoslavia. They may, however, be within 
range of Serb artillery. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO officials said Tuesday that the Albanian government has  
agreed to host the Apaches and their support units, but it likely 
will take more than a week before the helicopters are ready to 
operate over Kosovo. That is due in part to strains on air 
transport in Europe as the allies gear up humanitarian relief 
flights into Albania for the hundreds of thousands of displaced 
Kosovar Albanians. It also reflects the complications of assembling 
numerous support units for the Apaches -- including a battalion of 
multiple-launch rocket systems to provide protection against Serb 
air defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Apaches will come from the 11th Aviation Regiment of the  
Army's 5th Corps in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Helicopters have played a role in every major U.S. conflict  
since the 1950-53 Korean War, but it was in Vietnam that they began 
working in tandem with ground troops to attack enemy armor with 
rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	American helicopters flew an astounding 36 million sorties --  
defined as a single flight by a single aircraft -- during the 
Vietnam War, according to the Army Center for Military History. By 
Summers' count, only 10 U.S. helicopters were lost over North 
Vietnam, but 2,066 went down in hostile circumstances in the South. 
In all, 668 helicopter pilots and 1,471 crew members were killed in 
action. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1991 Persian Gulf War, the Apaches were star performers.  
On the opening night of the air war they punched a hole in Iraq's 
air defense network, opening a door for attacks by American fighter 
planes. In the war's final days, Iraqi soldiers actually 
surrendered to Apaches hovering over them.

<HEADLINE> Milstein Withdraws Redskins Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Heated emotions and cold cash doomed Howard  
Milstein's bid for the Washington Redskins. Now the search is on -- 
again -- for a new owner of the NFL team. 
</P>
<P>
	Milstein, saying he wanted to get out before the process got  
``protracted'' and ``contentious'' when it already was both, 
withdrew his group's $800 million bid to buy the Redskins on 
Wednesday when it became clear he lacked the necessary support from 
NFL owners. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have withdrawn with great sadness. ... In the end we  
complied with all the league's stated requirements and agreed to 
all of the league's additional conditions,'' Milstein said in a 
statement released at a special owners' meeting. ``But we recognize 
that a protracted, contentious dispute over ownership would cripple 
the Redskins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milstein's bid, which would have set a record for a U.S. sports  
franchise, was dogged from the start over questions about his 
finances and concerns that he would be a litigious, maverick owner. 
Although worth an estimated $500 million, Milstein has his fortune 
tied up in real estate and did not have enough ready cash on hand 
to satisfy many of the owners. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Milstein got his father to supply $125 million for  
the deal, but many owners viewed that as a loan rather than as 
liquid capital from the buyer. In a crucial vote, the league's 
finance committee met for 4 1/2 hours Wednesday and failed to 
recommend approval of the sale, splitting 3-3 with one abstention. 
Without a positive recommendation, the sale was virtually certain 
not to get the 24 of 31 votes needed from the full ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	Milstein, a New York real estate developer and part-owner of the  
NHL's Islanders, then briefly addressed the full ownership to make 
his case one final time before offering to pull out under an 
agreement brokered with input from commissioner Paul Tagliabue. 
Milstein left the room, and the owners voted 28-2-1 to accept the 
withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, Milstein promised not to sue the league. In  
return, the league agreed to assume responsibility for a 
non-refundable $30 million deposit Milstein was required to make 
when his bid was selected by the trustees of the estate of the late 
Jack Kent Cooke on Jan. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	However, as owners left the hotel, it quickly became clear that  
money wasn't the only thing at issue. Tagliabue said some owners 
were concerned about Milstein's confrontational stewardship of the 
Islanders, who are involved in multiple lawsuits in a fight for a 
new arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``Emotion may gotten invovled in it to some degree,'' said  
Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who supported the bid. ``They did 
have past experience, and I think some of those issues were 
perceived negatively, fairly or unfairly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finance committee chairman Bob Kraft, owner of the New England  
Patriots and another supporter of the bid, said a number of owners 
found the concept of the $30 million deposit ``quite offensive'' 
because it almost boxed the league into a corner. 
</P>
<P>
	``The method the trustees used to sell the team sort of picked  
our owner for us,'' Kraft said. ``The owners want to feel that 
we're picking who our new partner is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There will now be a new round of bidding conducted by the  
trustees. Milstein's minority partner, Washington-area 
communications executive Daniel Snyder, intends to be first in line 
-- this time as the person leading the group. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder, who would become the league's youngest owner at age 34,  
has more than $150 million cash available to mount a bid and left a 
positive impression with many NFL owners. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's logical,'' Jones said of a Snyder bid. ``Because he was a  
very positive and important part of this bid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Snyder nor Milstein were available for comment after the  
withdrawal was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Also re-entering the race will be Redskins president John Kent  
Cooke, son of the late owner. Cooke had vowed to keep the team in 
his family, but was outbid by an estimated $120 million in the 
first round. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today I have notified executors of my father's estate that my  
offer is still on the table,'' Cooke said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new round of bidding could be completed in about two months.  
Meanwhile, Cooke will continue to run the team, retaining coach 
Norv Turner and general manager Charley Casserly.

<HEADLINE> American, Pilots Resume Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- AMR Corp., parent company to American  
Airlines, resumed mediated talks with the carrier's pilots union on 
Wednesday to work on resolving a dispute over the acquisition of 
Reno Air. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is the integration of Reno into American and when  
Reno's pilots will be upgraded to American's pay levels. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, about 6,600 flights were canceled over a 10-day  
stretch as thousands of American pilots, frustrated with the talks, 
called in sick. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR and the Allied Pilots Association had agreed to a temporary  
recess in negotiations in March to accommodate the schedule of 
mediator George Nicolau. 
</P>
<P>
	In a press release Wednesday, Nicolau said talks would resume at  
his call. Both sides agreed not to discuss the details of the 
negotiations until they are concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	The parties met for three days in March and on Monday and  
Tuesday of this week, according to the release.

<HEADLINE> New Format for 2000 Fed Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The Fed Cup, the premier team event in women's  
tennis, is changing its format for the second time in five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Next year's competition will feature a 13-nation World Group,  
with 12 teams competing in a round-robin stage for three semifinal 
spots and the defending champion earning an automatic berth in the 
final four. 
</P>
<P>
	The round-robin phase will take place over one week. The finals  
will be staged in another week at a venue selected by the defending 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Tennis Federation announced the new structure  
Wednesday, although specific details will not be released until the 
first-round draw for World Groups One and Two on April 16. 
</P>
<P>
	ITF Fed Cup executive director Deborah Jevans said the new  
format would put the event on a stronger commercial footing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The changes are beneficial to all the constituent parts of the  
women's game,'' she said. ``The ITF will continue to run the 
regional qualifying groups which allow every nation the opportunity 
to gain promotion to the World Group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the new format, the eight teams in the 1999 World Group One  
will automatically go into the qualifying round along with the four 
winning teams from World Group Two. 
</P>
<P>
	The final spot will go to the winner of a playoff between the  
four remaining World Group Two nations and the four regional 
qualifying Group One winners. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed Cup format was changed in 1995 when the world groups  
were introduced and the previous tournament schedule was abolished.

<HEADLINE> Tenn. LB Ramseur Leaves School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tennessee linebacker Chris Ramseur  
withdrew from school for personal reasons, coach Phillip Fulmer 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A junior from Maiden, N.C., Ramseur was suspended in the  
offseason for academic reasons and entered spring practice with the 
question unresolved.

	Fulmer said he hasn't given up on Ramseur yet, and hopes he will  
be able to return to the squad later. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramseur is a backup middle linebacker who started two games in  
the Volunteers' national championship season last year in place of 
injured All-American Al Wilson. He had 42 tackles, two sacks and a

<HEADLINE> Dow Closes at New High: 10,085.31 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average soared in the  
last hour of trading today and hit a new high as investors, nervous 
about upcoming earnings reports, sought the relative safety of 
blue-chip stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was up 121.82 at 10,085.31. It was the Dow's third close 
above 10,000, and eclipsed the previous high close of 10,007.33, 
reached Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed, reflecting the fact that  
investors are for the time being turning away from unpredictable 
technology stocks and moving their money to blue-chips that are 
seen as surer bets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite index, heavily weighted in technology  
issues, fell 18.81 to 2,544.36, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index 
fell 9.00 to 2,560.29. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks opened strongly as aluminum maker Alcoa released  
first-quarter earnings that soundly beat analysts' expectations. 
The good news from Alcoa, a component of the Dow, helped many 
blue-chips move higher. Alcoa itself was up 2 13/16 to 43 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T, another Dow stock, was up 4 13/16 at 84 15/16.  
</P>
<P>
	The financial sector was mostly higher as analysts said banks  
and brokerages have hinted they will report strong earnings when 
they begin releasing first-quarter results next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Ned Riley, chief investment officer at BankBoston, said  
investors may be rewarding those companies for weathering the 
global financial crises of 1998. The financial companies are also 
benefiting from stable interest rates, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chase Manhattan rose 5 1/8 to 84 3/8, and Merrill Lynch rose 5 1/8 to  
96 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong sales report from Ford Motor sent its shares up 2 1/2 to  
60 3/4. The automaker said in its report Tuesday it plans to increase 
production in the coming months. The news enticed investors with 
hints of future strength. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip stocks easily outperformed technology stocks  
today. Computer companies held the market in check for much the 
afternoon after Merrill Lynch analysts warned of some tough times 
ahead for the high-tech sector. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem, according to William Meehan, chief market analyst  
at Cantor Fitzgerald, is that stocks are too overvalued to 
withstand even the slightest hint of caution. ``It doesn't take 
much to trigger any kind of stampede,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Software maker Novell slipped 1 1/8 to 22 15/16, and Sun  
Microsystems fell 1 7/8 to 138 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, traders were optimistically looking ahead to an  
after-hours earnings release from Yahoo!, which was expected to 
beat analyst estimates -- and did so, by three cents a share. Yahoo! 
ended lower in profit-taking after rising more than 16 points 
earlier in the day.

<HEADLINE> McDougal Closing Arguments Heard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The trial of President Clinton's former  
business partner, Susan McDougal, neared its close Wednesday with 
her lawyer comparing Kenneth Starr's tactics to the Third Reich and 
a prosecutor bristling at inflammatory allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury deliberations were expected to begin Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	In closing arguments, defense attorney Mark Geragos mocked  
testimony from Whitewater prosecutors who said they only wanted the 
truth from Mrs. McDougal and were not out to get the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something so offensive for them to say with a straight  
face they wanted to look to see if they could clear the president. 
How dumb do they think we are?'' he asked. Geragos added later: 
``Their goal is to crush everything between them and President and 
Mrs. Clinton'' 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the five-week trial, Mrs. McDougal's defense has been  
based on attacking the independent counsel's office. Mrs. McDougal, 
charged with twice refusing to answer questions before a federal 
grand jury, testified that she feared prosecutors would charge her 
with perjury if she told the truth and did not implicate the 
Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the courthouse, prosecutors noted ``there are lingering  
questions'' in the Whitewater investigation even though Mrs. 
McDougal answered some of the questions related to the Clintons. 
However, prosecutor Mark Barrett added, ``In terms of Mr. and Mrs. 
Clinton, I heard nothing that would have tended to show 
wrongdoing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Julie Myers told jurors that they had to weigh Mrs.  
McDougal's credibility against that of two of Starr's prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who is more credible? Two career federal prosecutors versus  
the defendant who is convicted of four felonies?'' Myers asked, 
referring to her own co-workers on Starr's staff, Ray Jahn and 
Hickman Ewing, who testified in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	She portrayed Mrs. McDougal, who was convicted of fraud for her  
role in the Whitewater case, as a chronic liar and publicity-seeker 
who reveled in telling a phony story of persecution in TV 
interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	``She craved the spotlight. She enjoyed the attention. And that  
was probably her real reason for not testifying, not those lame 
excuses,'' Myers told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal, who was convicted of four Whitewater-related  
felonies in 1996, testified that her former husband, James 
McDougal, later urged her to say she had sex with the president to 
mollify prosecutors eager to get Clinton for something and thereby 
escape further prosecution herself. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something you expect to see in the Third Reich,''  
Geragos told the jury. Mrs. McDougal has denied any intimate 
relationship with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``If she was the con artist, the liar, that Ms. Myers made her  
out to be, wouldn't it have been easier to say `I slept with 
President Clinton?''' Geragos asked. ``She could have gotten on any 
talk show she wanted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also noted that Mrs. McDougal had already served 18 months in  
jail for civil contempt because of her refusal to ``become a tool 
for out of control prosecutors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Myers said the suggestion that prosecutors wanted Mrs. McDougal  
to reveal a relationship with the president was an ``inflammatory 
allegation, an astounding allegation, an allegation that's 
absolutely unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal is charged with obstruction of justice and two  
counts of criminal contempt . The judge has limited what the jury 
can consider as her defense. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegation that prosecutors pressured her to implicate the  
Clintons can only be considered in relation to the obstruction 
charge, not the other two counts, U.S. District Judge George Howard 
ruled Tuesday in approving written instructions to the jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Myers noted that Mrs. McDougal said she appreciated Clinton  
providing testimony at her 1996 trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``But when she had information that, according to her, would  
help demonstrate the president's innocence, she selfishly refused 
to provide it to the grand jury or to anyone,'' Myers said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Olivetti Pushes Telecom Italia Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Olivetti SpA shareholders approved issuing an  
additional $2.8 billion in stock to help finance the Italian 
company's hostile bid for its larger rival, Telecom Italia SpA. 
</P>
<P>
	The shareholders' meeting Wednesday in Ivrea, Italy, marked an  
escalation in the biggest takeover battle ever launched in Europe's 
telecommunications industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti last month increased its offer for Telecom shares by 15  
percent to 60.4 billion euros, or $65.2 billion at current exchange 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to authorizing Olivetti's board to issue more stock,  
shareholders also approved the sale of bonds worth up to $4.5 
billion over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti chief executive Roberto Colaninno on Wednesday also  
attempted to clarify the company's strategy for pursuing Telecom 
Italia, which is five times Olivetti's size. 
</P>
<P>
	Colaninno said that Olivetti needs at least 35 percent of  
Telecom's shares in order to manage the bigger company effectively. 
</P>
<P>
	``With 6 percent, one cannot manage. With 35 percent, you can,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Colaninno had said Tuesday that Olivetti would not accept less  
than 35 percent of Telecom's ordinary voting shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Later that day, he backed off from that specific level, saying  
that Olivetti ``reserves the right to decide'' whether to honor its 
takeover offer if its bid gathers between 35 percent and 67 percent 
of Telecom's ordinary voting shares. If Olivetti accepted just 35 
percent of Telecom shares, it would pay about $22.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Colaninno was responding to requests by the Italian stock market  
regulator Consob that Olivetti clarify the minimum level of Telecom 
shares it would accept. Consob said Wednesday that it was still 
evaluating Olivetti's recent declarations regarding its bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom accused Olivetti on Tuesday of ``rewriting the takeover  
rules'' by refusing to clarify the minimum level of shares it was 
seeking. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom said the wide range between 35 percent and 67 percent  
doesn't give its shareholders a clear idea about Telecom's future 
capital structure and ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shareholders ... must be aware that they still are facing a  
takeover bid whose essential elements are absolutely uncertain,'' 
Telecom said. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom chief executive Franco Bernabe has called a  
shareholders' meeting of his own this weekend to consider measures 
aimed at boosting Telecom's value and making a takeover 
prohibitively expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	The measures include converting nonvoting savings shares into  
voting shares; buying back 10 percent of Telecom's outstanding 
shares; and spending some $24 billion to buy the 40 percent of 
Telecom's mobile phone subsidiary, Telecom Italia Mobila SpA, that 
it doesn't already own. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom, a former state-run monopoly, was privatized in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Open Higher; Dow Up 37.46 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened higher Wednesday as aluminum maker  
Alcoa released first-quarter earnings that soundly beat analysts' 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 37.46 at 10,000.95. Broader stock indicators were mostly higher. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent sessions, the fortunes of the Dow have turned on early  
indications of companies' first-quarter earnings. On Tuesday, 
Gillette's announcement that it expects to miss analysts' estimates 
by one penny depressed consumer stocks all day and prompted 
investors to send Gillette down 7 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow slipped 43.84 Tuesday to close at 9,963.49.  
</P>
<P>
	Today, Alcoa offered a different story. The metals company, a  
component of the Dow, said it earned 60 cents a share in the first 
quarter, while analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had expected 
earnings of 54 cents a share. Alcoa shares rose 1 1/16 to 42 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders were eagerly anticipating the after-hours earnings  
release from Yahoo!, which is also expected to beat estimates. Its 
shares rose 9/16 to 215 7/16. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. stock market also drew strength today from overseas.  
European markets were strong for a second consecutive session. 
Japan's Nikkei index increased a solid 0.5 percent, and Hong Kong's 
Hang Seng soared 5 percent after a long holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 7.81 at 1,325.70, and the  
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was up 23.99 at 2,587.16. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 99.5 million 
shares, well ahead of Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 1.99 at 614.31, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was down 0.66 at 714.55. 
</P>
<P>
	In afternoon trading overseas, Germany's DAX index was up 1.0  
percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 1.4 percent, and France's 
CAC-40 was up 1.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals: Vina Deal Is Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Middle reliever Manny Aybar and a minor league  
pitcher for Brewers All-Star second baseman Fernando Vina sounds 
like a pretty good deal for the St. Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Not to general manager Walt Jocketty, who says the Cardinals are  
just as strapped for pitchers as the team that wants to take Aybar 
off their hands. Thus, that deal likely won't happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't sacrifice any more pitching,'' Jocketty said. ``If you  
do that, then you open another hole. Right now, anything we do is 
going to be for pitching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals' winter game plan had been to acquire a No. 1  
starter and quality shortstop and then fill in at second base with 
a lesser talent such as Polanco, David Howard or Pat Kelly, who was 
the final roster cut. They got the shortstop they wanted in Edgar 
Renteria, but not the No. 1 pitcher, yet the fill-in plan at second 
remains. 
</P>
<P>
	Aybar, 24, hasn't done much at the major-league but remains a  
hot property for the Cardinals. He was 10-0 at Triple-A Memphis and 
6-6 with a 5.98 ERA with St. Louis, including 14 starts, and was 
guaranteed a roster spot because he's out of options. 
</P>
<P>
	Jocketty is hopeful a combination of Polanco and Howard, who is  
on the 15-day disabled list with an injured groin, can be 
effective. 
</P>
<P>
	``Polanco, I think, will surprise some people if he gets a  
chance to play enough,'' Jocketty said. ``He can do a lot of little 
things and he takes a great at-bat up there all the time. Howard 
gives us great defense and is a switch-hitter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Polanco, 23, batted .254 with one homer and 11 RBIs in 114  
at-bats last season. Howard, 32, missed the second half of the 
season with a shoulder injury and batted .245 with two homers and 
12 RBIs in 102 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard injured his groin in the final inning of the final spring  
game on Saturday. He said Wednesday he could play, but the 
Cardinals couldn't afford to risk keeping him on the roster since 
Renteria is getting limited duty from a bone bruise that kept him 
out all spring.

<HEADLINE> Flyers' Lindros Status Uncertain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Eric Lindros is coming home. Will the memory  
of his last game of the season stay in Nashville? 
</P>
<P>
	The Philadelphia Flyers star, recovering from a collapsed lung  
in a Nashville, Tenn., hospital, is scheduled to be flown home 
Thursday. His status for the playoffs is still uncertain, with one 
doctor acknowledging that Lindros will need at least 3-4 weeks to 
regenerate the blood he lost. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talked to him today and to the doctors,'' Flyers physician  
Dr. Jeff Hartzell said. ``He's feeling a lot better. His condition 
is perfectly satisfactory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Well, satisfactory for a guy with a desk job, not for one of the  
most talented, ferocious players in hockey. It may be quite some 
time before Lindros gets to put on a burst of speed at the blue 
line again, smack the puck past a goaltender or drop the gloves and 
give the Flyers the boost needed to make a run in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	This is not a chipped tooth, sprained knee or fat lip, the most  
common injuries in Lindros' brutal sport. His collapsed lung, which 
filled with about three liters of blood, was termed 
life-threatening if it hadn't been treated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to wait for the doctors to convince me that he is going  
to be playing in the near future,'' said his father and agent, Carl 
Lindros, who is concerned about his son being rushed back. ``Eric 
is going to make the final decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hartzell spoke with Lindros' father Tuesday and reassured him  
that nothing would be done to jeopardize his son's health. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no rush,'' Flyers general manager Bob Clarke said.  
``We want Eric to come back when the doctors say he's ready. It 
hasn't changed since day 1.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros will get a sendoff in the form of a news conference at  
11 a.m. EDT before he leaves Nashville's Baptist Hospital. He will 
be examined by doctors and accompanied by renowned chest surgeon 
Larry Kaiser of the University of Pennsylvania hospitals. Kaiser 
will have the final say as to whether Lindros is ready to travel. 
</P>
<P>
	If all goes as planned, he will be flown to Philadelphia on team  
chairman Ed Snider's jet and sent home to recover. Doctors are 
being tight-lipped about Lindros' prospects for playing again this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``My opinion is, I think nobody really knows,'' Hartzell said.  
``In my own view, two things have to happen. One, Eric has to feel 
strong and ready to play. Two, doctors would have to say there's no 
risk for him to play, and I don't know when that's going to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Gary Dorshimer, another Flyers doctor, said Lindros'  
temperature spiking above 100 degrees Tuesday night was not a 
setback. Lindros had mucous removed from one of his bronchial 
tubes, which could have caused the fever. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros never had a blood transfusion during the ordeal that  
began early Friday morning after a 2-1 victory over the Nashville 
Predators. Doctors are still doing tests to determine what caused 
the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros is on numerous medications, including epogen, a hormone  
that stimulates bone marrow to produce red blood cells. Hartzell 
said Lindros' red blood count is increasing. But he acknowledged 
that Lindros can't begin to contemplate playing hockey until 
``virtually all'' of the red blood cells he lost are replenished. 
</P>
<P>
	``You do the math,'' Hartzell said. ``Three to four weeks, and  
then he has to have his conditioning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers, once considered a favorite to contend for the  
Stanley Cup, have been without Lindros and three other top players. 
John LeClair, Mark Recchi and Eric Desjardins have been cleared to 
play Thursday night against Pittsburgh.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Exchange Index Climbs / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's benchmark stock index climbed to its  
highest level in nearly nine months today, spurred by continued 
buying by foreign investors. The U.S. dollar fell against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.78 yen at late afternoon, down 0.28 yen  
from late Tuesday in Tokyo but above its late New York level of 
120.62 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 74.79 points, or 0.45  
percent, closing at 16,554.50 points, its highest close since July 
21, when the average closed at 16,556.69. The average has now 
gained for the third straight day, fetching 264.31 points in three 
days, including Tuesday's 144.93-point gain, or 0.89 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei average moved into positive territory toward the  
closing bell with gains in high technology issues, including Sony 
and Toshiba. 
</P>
<P>
	Miyoshi Okano, manager of the equity department with Cosmo  
Securities, said continued buying by U.S. investment funds led the 
way as they considered Japanese stocks still priced relatively low, 
compared to their U.S. and European counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 709  
million shares, up from Tuesday's 568 million shares. Advancers 
outnumbered declines 762 to 466, with 98 issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 2.03 points, or 0.15 percent, to 1,324.64. The 
TOPIX closed up 15.44 points, or 1.18 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar slipped against the yen after  
the euro strengthened as Yugoslavia announced a unilateral 
cease-fire in its battle against Kosovo rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslav action was rejected by Western leaders, who said  
the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia would continue. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar, often regarded as a haven in times of international  
unrest, had been rising against the euro since the bombing began on 
March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	In today's trading, the dollar ranged between 120.43 yen and  
121.20 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo trading, the euro bought $1.0775, up from its late  
Tuesday rate in Tokyo of $1.0715. The euro also bought 130.20 yen, 
up from 130.19 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 211 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.675 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.795 percent, 
driving its price up to 101.08 yen from 100.04 yen.

<HEADLINE> Computer Recycling Program in Mass. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Tired of keeping up on the information  
superhighway? Not to worry, old computers may soon be part of the 
highway -- as pothole filler. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Department of Environmental Protection has joined  
forces with the American Plastics Council to promote the recycling 
and marketing of plastics from electronics. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want people to take those computers out of the attics, get  
them out of the landfills and make use of the good parts,'' said 
Rick Lombardi, spokesman for the department. ``And God knows, we 
have plenty of potholes to fill in New England.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A lightweight, asphalt-type mix can be made with the plastic  
portions of computers, along with such equipment as printers, paper 
trays and scanners. 
</P>
<P>
	A pothole filler has been developed by Conigliaro Industries  
Inc. of Framingham, which processes up to 12.5 tons of computer and 
other plastic housings from across the Northeast every day. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting Sept. 1, Massachusetts residents will be prohibited  
from dumping computers and cathode-ray tubes -- which are contained 
in TVs -- in landfills. 
</P>
<P>
	The department estimated Tuesday that more then 1 million  
computers and televisions -- which account for an increasing amount 
of the state's waste -- will become obsolete in the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
	Discarded electronics account for 75,000 tons per year of solid  
waste in Massachusetts, the department said. By 2006, the volume of 
waste generated is expected to be 300,000 tons per year.

<HEADLINE>  Neil Armstrong Launches First Pitch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Neil Armstrong isn't much for public appearances,  
but the space pioneer made an exception for the start of the 
Astrodome's farewell baseball season. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, among 23 astronauts who simultaneously threw out  
ceremonial first pitches when the Astrodome opened April 12, 1965, 
did the job solo today before Houston's opener against the Chicago 
Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I called him, and he said, `I don't do public events,' ''  
Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr. said. Armstrong, fiercely 
protective of his privacy in recent years, relented after McLane 
explained the historic significance of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be club's 35th and final season in the Astrodome, the  
world's first indoor stadium. Next April, the Astros will move into 
a new retractable-roof ballpark downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	Acting as de facto spokesman for Armstrong, who rarely does  
interviews, McLane said Armstrong was a fixture at Colt .45s and 
Astros games when he lived in the area for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	``He loved living in Houston. He had such a great experience  
living here,'' said McLane, who was host to the Ohio native in his 
field-level box. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong was escorted onto the field by Jimmy Wynn and Bob  
Aspromonte, members of the 1965 Astros. About 70 current astronauts 
lined both baselines while Armstrong waved twice to a standing 
ovation and delivered a one-hop pitch to Craig Biggio.

	Armstrong will mark the 30th anniversary of his landmark moon  
walk July 20.

<HEADLINE> Boston Winner Hits $197M Jackpot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- There was just one winning ticket in the six-state  
Big Game's record $197 million jackpot, and it was sold in Boston, 
lottery officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The ticket -- bearing the winning numbers drawn Tuesday of 12,  
17, 22, 33 and 44, with the Big Money Ball of 25 -- was sold at a 
Star Market supermarket near Fenway Park, lottery officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	No one had come forward to claim the prize as of late morning.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're all thrilled,'' said Linda Marino, a Star Market  
employee. ``It's just pure excitement here. Now we're waiting to 
see who won the money. Hopefully, an employee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The store will get $50,000 for selling the winning ticket.  
</P>
<P>
	The jackpot had been growing since Feb. 2. The jackpot had been  
estimated at $190 million Tuesday night, but the final flood of 
ticket sales raised it by $7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Big Game is played in Georgia, Illinois, Maryland,  
Massachusetts, Michigan and Virginia, and the drawing is held in 
Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. record for a lottery prize is the $295.7 million  
jackpot last July in the Powerball lottery, played in 20 states and 
the District of Columbia. It was shared by 13 workers at an Ohio 
machine shop.

<HEADLINE> Condren, Zito Seek 3rd Derby Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- William Condren is content. He's in  
Kentucky in the spring with a Derby hopeful, and he is involved 
with two men he calls friends. 
</P>
<P>
	One is George M. Steinbrenner, the boss of the New York Yankees,  
who sold Condren an interest in Wondertross, who was bred in 
Kentucky by Steinbrenner's Kinsman Farm. 
</P>
<P>
	The other is trainer Nick Zito.  
</P>
<P>
	``Nick knows a lot about the first Saturday in May,'' Condren  
said Wednesday outside of Zito's barn at Keeneland. 
</P>
<P>
	If Wondertross, second by a nose to Vicar in the Florida Derby  
March 13, runs well in the Toyota Blue Grass on Saturday, on May 1 
he will parade to the strains of ``My Kentucky Home.'' Condren and 
Zito will wait anxiously to see if the colt can put them into the 
Derby winner's circle for a third time. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be a first Derby victory for Steinbrenner, who has  
owned three starters and co-owned another. 
</P>
<P>
	Zito won the race in 1991 with Strike the Gold and in 1994 with  
Go for Gin. Condren co-owned both colts. 
</P>
<P>
	It's doubtful if anybody gets more of a kick out of the Derby  
than Zito, who grew up on the streets of New York. Some trainers 
will tell you, or try to tell you, the Derby is not that big a 
deal. Zito is not one of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Zito can get emotional just talking about the Derby.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to finish off the `90s the right way,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	That would be by snapping a tie with trainers Bob Baffert and D.  
Wayne Lukas for the most Derby wins in the 1990s. Baffert, of 
course, won the last two Derbies with Silver Charm and Real Quiet. 
Lukas won with Thunder Gulch in 1994 and with Grindstone in 1996. 
He also won with the filly Winning Colors in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Finishing off the `90s the right way for Zito might not be the  
right way for Condren and Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	Zito could also win the Derby with Stephen Go Even, owned by  
Stephen Hilbert. Stephen Go Even has won all three starts this 
year, including an impressive win in the Gallery Furniture.com 
Stakes on March 27 at Turfway Park. His next start will be in the 
Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert has two Derby starters in General Challenge and Prime  
Timber, 1-2, respectively, in last Saturday's Santa Anita Derby. 
Lukas has Charismatic, fourth at Santa Anita, in the Derby and he 
probably will have Cat Thief, who will start in the Blue Grass. 
</P>
<P>
	Condren got into this year's Derby picture because of Zito and  
Steinbrenner's son, Hank, who runs his father's racing and breeding 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	After Wondertross finished second in the Remsen on Nov. 28 at  
Aqueduct in the final start of his four-race 2-year-old campaign -- 
during which he won twice -- Steinbrenner got offers to sell an 
interest in the colt. 
</P>
<P>
	``George was not interested in a partnership,'' Condren said.  
``But Hank convinced his father that it was commercially prudent to 
sell a portion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Condren recalled that Steinbrenner told his son, ``Call Nick  
Zito,'' with whom Steinbrenner has had horses. Zito called Condren, 
and when Condren bought an interest in Wondertross, the colt was 
taken from trainer John Tammaro Jr. and given to Zito. 
</P>
<P>
	Under his deal with Steinbrenner, Condren said, ``I am the  
managing co-owner and the horse runs in my colors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Should Wondertross win the Kentucky Derby, you can bet Condren's  
colors would look like pinstripes to his partner -- the Boss.

<HEADLINE> Austin School District Indicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- The Austin school district and a deputy  
superintendent have been indicted on charges of manipulating 
statewide test results in a scheme to boost school performance 
ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Parents in our district and throughout the state have a right  
to know the truth about their children's schools,'' prosecutor Ken 
Oden said Tuesday. ``The goal of our enforcement efforts is to see 
that the system is not covering up the truth to make itself look 
good while the students' needs are overlooked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oden said the indictments mark the first time in Texas history  
that criminal charges have been filed against a school district. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted of tampering with a government record, the Austin  
Independent School District could face fines of up to $160,000. The 
deputy superintendent, Margaret Kay Psencik, could face up to a 
year in jail, a $4,000 fine or both. 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer, Roy Minton, said she did nothing wrong.  
</P>
<P>
	``We'll certainly be ready to go to trial on this. The lady has  
not done a single thing that's a violation of any law, nor anything 
that's improper,'' Minton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation was launched in September after reports that  
student identification numbers were changed on some Texas 
Assessment of Academic Skills tests, which are used to rate and 
compare schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas Education Agency lowered some Austin schools' ratings  
after an audit suggested school officials changed the numbers of 
students who performed poorly on the test in order to raise 
ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	Oden said the district can be held legally liable for the  
criminal acts of its employees. He emphasized that the indictment 
didn't charge or imply personal wrongdoing by school board members. 
</P>
<P>
	``On behalf of the board of trustees, let me reiterate that we  
do not condone these behaviors which have brought us to this 
point,'' Superintendent A.C. Gonzalez said.

<HEADLINE> Johnny Cash Returns To Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Johnny Cash made it back on stage for the first  
time in more than a year and a half of illness. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels good, it feels good, it feels good,'' Cash said  
Tuesday night, his voice clear and strong as he sang ``Folsom 
Prison Blues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	TNT taped the all-star show, which featured Willie Nelson, Bruce  
Springsteen, Bob Dylan, U2, Sheryl Crow, Emmylou Harris and Wyclef 
Jean, for a special to air April 18. Cash's appearance in 
Manhattan's Hammerstein Ballroom was unannounced. 
</P>
<P>
	There was some question if he'd ever make it on stage again.  
Cash, 67, has Shy-Drager Syndrome, a rare neurological disorder 
that causes progressive damage to the nervous system. 
</P>
<P>
	Each performer paid sartorial tribute to ``The Man in Black'' by  
dressing in the color. 
</P>
<P>
	Near the show's end, the lights dimmed and actor Tim Robbins  
read a Cash essay about life in prison. The lights rose to reveal 
the author on stage, breaking into song after his traditional 
introduction: ``Hello, I'm Johnny Cash.''

<HEADLINE> Ripken Misses Start Due to Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- After going 2,632 games without a day off, Cal  
Ripken is suddenly getting in the habit of watching from the 
dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time since 1982, the Baltimore Orioles third  
baseman missed a game because of injury Wednesday. Saddled with a 
stiff lower back, Ripken decided it would be better to take a seat 
than to take a chance. 
</P>
<P>
	So he never picked up a bat and watched the Orioles lose to  
Tampa Bay 8-5. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second time in the Orioles' last 10 games Ripken  
failed to play. Last Sept. 20, he voluntarily ended his record 
consecutive games streak by sitting out Baltimore's final home game 
against the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, who left the Orioles' season opener Monday in the third  
inning with painful back spasms, began Wednesday night's game in 
the dugout while Willis Otanez took over at third base. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could beat my head against the wall and go do it today, but  
it doesn't make sense,'' Ripken said. ```We're going to just work 
toward being ready tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hours before the game, Ripken told manager Ray Miller that he  
wasn't quite 100 percent. So Miller decided to give Ripken the day 
off, even though he had already written the third baseman into the 
starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him I'd rather err on the side of caution and give him  
another 24 hours,'' Miller said. ``In my heart I know he never 
played a game just because of the streak. Fortunately for us it's 
not there anymore, so we can use a little better judgment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the streak were still alive, it probably would have come to a  
dramatic conclusion Wednesday night. Although Ripken's back felt a 
lot better than it did Monday, it was far from peak condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it was 90 percent, playing would be a no-brainer,'' he  
said. ``Every situation is different, but I doubt I'd play tonight 
regardless if the streak was still alive. ... I want to be able to 
contribute this whole season, and it wouldn't make sense to push it 
just to play one game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Ripken missed a game because of injury was on May  
3, 1982 after he got beaned by Seattle rookie Mike Moore. His 
record streak began later that month and survived two ankle 
injuries, a twisted knee and a herniated disc in his back in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	None of those ailments affected him the way his injury did  
Monday, when he was rendered helpless by stiffness, tightness and 
spasms in his lower back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't consider myself superhuman. But I never reached a  
point where I couldn't play until the other day,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Otanez, meanwhile, was delighted to get his third major league  
start, but would have preferred it occurred under different 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice for me, I was happy to see I'm playing,'' he said.  
``But I don't want my teammate to get hurt like that. That's not 
good. I hope he gets well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Otanez hit his first major league homer and doubled in a 2-for-5  
night.

<HEADLINE> Self-Employed Top IRS Audit Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The computer formula used by the IRS to pick  
income tax returns for audit rivals a nuclear launch code in its 
secrecy. But some red flags are known: The self-employed and people 
claiming unusually high itemized deductions are among those more 
likely to face an audit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internal Revenue Service audits less than 2 percent of the  
returns it receives and won't disclose precisely how it targets 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, what you're going to see is people who have  
something out of the ordinary on the return,'' said Mike 
Szalkowski, senior manager at Ernst &AMP; Young accountants in Atlanta. 
``For instance, a high mortgage interest deduction and low income. 
They look for things that don't make sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From the IRS standpoint, the only people who should fear an  
audit are those who are trying to cheat or those who don't have 
documentation for their deductions or other claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're entitled to a deduction, and you have the records to  
back it up, by all means you should take it,'' said IRS spokesman 
Don Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-thirds of audited tax returns are picked by IRS computers in  
Martinsburg, W.Va., using what is called the ``discriminant 
function,'' or DIF. These are top secret formulas designed to 
screen for returns that have a higher potential for payment of more 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Other audits are selected through referrals from state and local  
governments, from criminal cases and by special enforcement 
programs such as those aimed at cutting down questionable tax 
shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	New York accountant Nick Morrow said statistics show two broad  
categories of tax returns are frequently flagged by the computers: 
Schedule C returns filed by the self-employed where deductions 
exceed 63 percent of income and Schedule A itemized deductions that 
are over 44 percent of adjusted gross income. 
</P>
<P>
	Because final audit decisions are made by humans at IRS and not  
machines, Morrow said people who fall into these categories should 
make sure their returns are not sloppy and that numbers are not too 
rounded, so they appear designed to just meet legal requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	Other red flags include big deductions such as those for medical  
expenses, which must exceed 7.5 percent of a taxpayer's gross 
income, unusually large charitable contributions or casualty 
losses, large moving expenses or hobby losses and claims for 
business use of the home. The IRS has also occasionally targeted 
certain professions for extra scrutiny, such as lawyers and taxi 
drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	Each year, 1 million to 2 million individual returns are  
audited. By far the most common is the correspondence audit, in 
which the taxpayer receives an IRS letter asking for more 
information about one or two relatively simple items. 
</P>
<P>
	If the claims are documented, usually the case is closed. If  
not, the taxpayer gets another letter describing the additional 
taxes to be paid. A key reminder for taxpayers: Respond promptly in 
writing to every IRS letter. 
</P>
<P>
	``They love to see paper,'' said Morrow, personal finance  
director at Martin Geller CPA. ``Give them plenty of it, as long as 
it's relevant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More complex audits, often those involving business returns or  
investments, are handled in IRS district offices by revenue agents 
or tax auditors with greater training. Most professional preparers 
say taxpayers are better off if they have a lawyer or accountant on 
hand to help them. 
</P>
<P>
	But taxpayers who meet with the IRS alone should remember to  
take only the documents the government wants. It's not wise to 
start volunteering information. 
</P>
<P>
	``People start blabbing about stuff the IRS wasn't  
questioning,'' said Ernst &AMP; Young's Szalkowski. ``They definitely 
won't lend a deaf ear if you start talking about what you've 
done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two IRS documents, Publications 5 and 556, detail what happens  
in an audit, describe taxpayer rights and show how to appeal an 
audit. Both are available on the Internet at 
http://www.irs.ustreas.gov. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the IRS Taxpayer Advocate's Office has a Problem  
Resolution Program available toll-free at 1-877-777-4778 to help 
resolve thorny tax disputes.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed; Dow Up 16.93 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed Wednesday after technology  
shares, falling on a pessimistic earnings outlook, pulled the rest 
of the market lower. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
16.93 at 9,980.42. Broader stock indicators mostly fell. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks opened strongly today as aluminum maker Alcoa released  
first-quarter earnings that soundly beat analysts' expectations. 
The good news from Alcoa, a component of the Dow, propped up a 
number of blue-chip companies. 
</P>
<P>
	But at midmorning, said William Meehan, chief market analyst at  
Cantor Fitzgerald, many Dow stocks gave up their gains. Alcoa 
continued to rise, advancing 1 1/2 to 42 9/16, and financial-services 
companies rose as well. But technology companies began to falter, 
with IBM falling 3 7/16 to 179 9/16, and Hewlett Packard falling 1 
11/16 to 68 5/16. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem, Meehan said, is that stocks are too overvalued to  
withstand even the slightest hint of caution. ``It doesn't take 
much to trigger any kind of stampede,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's catalyst was a warning from Merrill Lynch analysts  
warning of some tough times ahead for the high-tech sector. 
</P>
<P>
	But traders were optimistically looking ahead to an after-hours  
earnings release from Yahoo!, which was expected to beat analyst 
estimates. Yahoo! rose 1 1/8 to 216. 
</P>
<P>
	Revlon rose 2 5/8 to 22 5/8 after the cosmetics maker said it is  
considering the sale of one or more of its businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 3.12 at 1,314.77, and  
the Nasdaq composite index, which is heavily weighted with 
technology stocks, was down 46.36 at 2,516.81. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues were ahead of advancers by a 6-to-5 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 376.1 million 
shares, ahead of Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 0.40 at 612.72, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 0.98 at 716.19.

Tuesday, but was lower against the euro, which rose to $1.0795 from 
$1.0728. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
	The British pound was quoted at $1.5949, down from $1.5992.

Swiss francs and 1,5008 Canadian dollars. The euro was worth 
$1.0789 and the British pound was worth $1.5973. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately, though they remain in use. Based on 
Wednesday's euro rates, the dollar is worth: 1.8118 German marks, 
down from 1.8231; 6.0765 French francs, down from 6.1144; and 
1,793.67 Italian lire, down from 1,804.88.

<TEXT>
<P>
	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil, led by strikers Fabio Junior and  
Denilson, routed the United States 7-0 in a under-23 game 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team, missing several players who are with Major League  
Soccer teams, spent most of the game trying vainly to keep up with 
their tricky, fitter-looking opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	Two slipups by U.S. goalie Matt Napoleon in the first half gave  
Brazil a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	He brought down Fabio Junior, of Italy's AC Roma, in the penalty  
box after 23 minutes. Denilson, of Spain's Betis, swept in the 
penalty kick. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, 12 minutes later, Napoleon failed to hold a curling free  
kick and Marcos Paulo pounced on it to score. 
</P>
<P>
	As the U.S. team started to tire in the second half, an unmarked  
Warley steered a header into the net for Brazil at 60 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Six minutes later, substitute Roni scored his first goal for the  
national team. He added his second 12 minutes later, driving a 
left-footed shot home. 
</P>
<P>
	Arujo chipped a ball over Napoleon as the keeper came off his  
line for the sixth goal. Rodrigo made it seven right at the end 
with a penalty kick.

<HEADLINE> Teens Plead Guilty in Nev. Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATTLE MOUNTAIN, Nev. (AP) -- A teen-age boy who said his mom  
made him mad because she wouldn't let him ``do stuff'' and a friend 
pleaded guilty Wednesday to killing the boy's family. 
</P>
<P>
	Kyle Ray and Colby Becker plotted the killings and traded off  
pulling the trigger, killing Ray's parents and 12-year-old sister 
in June, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Charged as adults, Ray pleaded guilty to two counts of murder  
with use of a deadly weapon and Becker pleaded guilty to one count 
of the same charge. 
</P>
<P>
	The boys were both 15 at the time of the killings in this mining  
town about 220 miles east of Reno. They face up to life in prison 
with or without the possibility of parole when they are sentenced 
in June. 
</P>
<P>
	They are too young for the death penalty.  
</P>
<P>
	When Ray and Becker entered their pleas in district court and  
were asked by the judge to tell him what happened, ``Becker said 'I 
shot Kyle's dad in the back of the head,''' prosecutor Robert Estes 
said. ``And Kyle Ray said 'I shot my mom and my sister.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``Ever since I got this case I've been looking for a reason and  
there isn't one,'' said prosecutor Robert Estes said. 
</P>
<P>
	The best explanation he could find was a statement Ray made to  
police about how his mom made him mad because ``she wouldn't let me 
do stuff,'' Estes said. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for their pleas, Estes said he will not oppose the  
chance for parole.

<HEADLINE> Sex Offenders Map Plan Under Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A plan to distribute maps that vaguely show  
where sex offenders live near elementary schools has triggered 
criticism from civil liberties activists who fear ex-cons could 
become targets of vigilantism and harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	Police in South Gate, a city of 87,000 southeast of Los Angeles,  
want to pass out the maps to children in 13 elementary schools. The 
maps are tailored for each school, with black dots showing the 
general location of the offenders' homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The fliers don't provide names or addresses.  
</P>
<P>
	Teachers expected to begin passing out the maps to students  
Tuesday. But the Los Angeles Unified School District, which 
presides over 10 of South Gate's grade schools, ordered teachers to 
hold off so administrators could review the fliers. 
</P>
<P>
	The map project is patterned after one in the Northern  
California city of Fremont. In 1997, about 80 elementary and junior 
high schools in that city's school district distributed similar 
maps to parents and students. Police there call their program 
``very successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But critics say residents could use the fliers to harass or  
attack the sex offenders. They also say the maps are based on a 
state computer database of sex offenders plagued in the past with 
inaccurate information. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no guarantee that this map will be accurate the day  
after it's published, but you forever branded the home where that 
person previously lived,'' said Elizabeth Schroeder, associate 
director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Megan's Law, Californians can learn from police the names  
and descriptions of nearly 64,000 convicted sex offenders living in 
their communities. The law is named for Megan Kanka, a 7-year-old 
New Jersey girl raped and strangled in 1994 by a twice-convicted 
sex offender. 
</P>
<P>
	Many states like California keep such information on a computer  
database accessible at computer terminals in police and sheriff's 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
	In Fremont, the maps prompted many parents to familiarize  
themselves with local molesters, although just one ``high-risk'' 
sex offender remains in the area, said Detective Dennis Madsen. 
</P>
<P>
	``It raised the interest of parents,'' he said. ``They lined up  
four or five hours to get onto that computer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Madsen said detectives check the map's accuracy, and there's  
little danger of vigilantism because the black dots represent an 
area too vague for possible harassment.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Leader Seeks More Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- President Hugo Chavez has warned  
Congress may be dissolved and rejected a law giving him sweeping 
new powers, saying it doesn't go far enough. At the same time, his 
secret police chief arrested the son of a key opposition leader. 
</P>
<P>
	The former coup plotter turned president denies any political  
repression, but critics say Venezuela is descending into old-style 
Latin American authoritarianism. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez, 44, called reporters to the presidential palace late  
Tuesday to announce he was vetoing a law that would have given him 
broad powers to revive Venezuela's flagging economy. 
</P>
<P>
	He warned that Congress would be ``as good as dissolved'' if it  
tries to ``sabotage'' his efforts to get the economy back on track. 
A constituent assembly rewriting the constitution would dissolve 
it, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	As the president spoke, Congress convened an extraordinary  
session just blocks away to denounce the arrest this week of the 
son of Lewis Perez, secretary general of the Democratic Action 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are living with a government of persecution, of  
intimidation,'' Perez said a few hours before his 24-year-old son, 
Daniel, was released while authorities investigate what Chavez 
opponents say are trumped-up charges of illegal arms trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez insisted he had nothing to do with Daniel Perez's arrest  
and that his calls for greater powers are merely an attempt to 
honor his campaign promise to bring a ``social revolution'' to 
Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
	``Allow us to transform the country,'' he said. ``Our intentions  
are good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez, who took office in February, isn't the first Venezuelan  
president to ask for fast-track legislative authority. But because 
of his coup attempt seven years ago, the world is watching him more 
closely. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say the president, who enjoys widespread popularity  
among Venezuela's 23 million citizens, is sending ominous signals. 
</P>
<P>
	The army is taking on a greater role in society, with tens of  
thousands of soldiers traveling around the country to repair roads 
and tend to the sick. 
</P>
<P>
	Venezuelan Jewish leaders have expressed concern over Chavez's  
friendship with Norberto Ceresole, an Argentine writer who says the 
Holocaust never happened and espouses a ``leader-army-masses'' 
troika that excludes political parties. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez may have already bought into that idea, distancing  
himself even from his own party. On Tuesday, congressmen from his 
Fifth Republic Movement added their voices to the protests against 
Daniel Perez's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	State governors from many parts of the country have said the  
Chavez administration is angling to gain control over their budgets 
-- an affront, they say, to the ongoing process of decentralization. 
</P>
<P>
	And Chavez's rejection of the law allowing him to rule by decree  
for six months on issues ranging from tax collection to deficit 
reduction, was seen by some as just another power grab. 
</P>
<P>
	Time is running short for Chavez because of Venezuela's acute  
economic crisis, caused by a drop in world oil prices, the 
country's main export. This year's budget deficit is estimated at 
$8 billion, and hundreds of businesses have gone bankrupt, 
exacerbating unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez says his proposal to rewrite the constitution -- to be  
voted on in a referendum later this month -- will go a long way 
toward improving economic conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, he says, he needs far greater powers. The law  
approved by Congress 10 days ago was insufficient, he argues, 
because it failed to give him a mandate to renegotiate Venezuela's 
$22 billion foreign debt and to trim the bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Chavez's policies have been relatively market friendly,  
putting to rest the worst fears of investors. But analysts say 
Chavez's style could be a big drag on the economy by creating 
uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the president again conjured images of a Latin  
American strongman, stressing that he has the power to declare a 
state of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope Congress doesn't force me to do that,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Hanford Contractors Sued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- Two contractors have been accused in a  
federal lawsuit of overcharging the Department of Energy by at 
least $85 million for cleanup work at the Hanford nuclear 
reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	Westinghouse Hanford Co. and Fluor Daniel Hanford Inc. used a  
computerized accounting scheme involving wages, according to the 
lawsuit filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court here. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department has not joined the suit filed by David  
Carbaugh, an accountant who worked for both contractors. Carbaugh 
claims his complaints to supervisors eventually led to his 
dismissal by Fluor. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit seeks $240 million in damages.  
</P>
<P>
	Hanford, built in 1943 as part of the secret World War II  
Manhattan Project, produced plutonium for the U.S. nuclear arsenal 
into the 1980s. The 560-square-mile Department of Energy site in 
southeastern Washington is considered the nation's most 
contaminated nuclear site. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit claims the contractors were allowed to bill the  
government 14 cents for every dollar paid workers in straight time, 
in order to cover vacation, sick time and holiday pay. However, 
they allegedly added the surcharge to overtime wages -- and used 
inflated labor costs to calculate pensions, benefits and general 
overhead. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Westinghouse said the charges were similar to  
ones Carbaugh filed in a 1996 lawsuit and were untrue. A spokesman 
for Fluor said the company was not aware of the suit.

<HEADLINE> Defense Rests in Lakers' Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- The Los Angeles Lakers are defenseless  
on their home court against the Utah Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
	And that might not bode well come playoff time, assuming the  
teams meet. 
</P>
<P>
	With everyone doing his own thing, the Lakers lost 106-93  
Tuesday night to the team that swept them in last season's Western 
Conference finals. The Jazz have beaten the Lakers twice at the 
Forum this season, with Los Angeles winning once in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	``They started falling asleep and coming up with their own  
system of how to play defense instead of sticking to what we had in 
mind,'' Lakers coach Kurt Rambis said. ``They weren't focused, 
weren't concentrating on what we had to do defensively.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Karl Malone scored 30 points, hitting all 12 of his  
field goal attempts, and Shandon Anderson burned Los Angeles' 
defense for 12 points in the fourth quarter. Anderson repeatedly 
drove for layups the Lakers couldn't stop. 
</P>
<P>
	``Defense is where we are breaking down,'' Lakers guard Derek  
Harper said. ``When you are playing catchup against a team like 
Utah in the fourth quarter, you are really, really going to be in 
trouble. That's where we were. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until we can get defensive stops, we are not going to be able  
to beat the elite teams,'' Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaquille O'Neal led the Lakers with 24 points, but was rendered  
nearly useless in the second half because of five fouls, and scored 
just three points in the final 24 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal and Dennis Rodman were hit with technical fouls.  
</P>
<P>
	``We need to stick with the team rather than try to do stuff on  
our own,'' O'Neal said. ``We had a lack of concentration, a lack of 
mental toughness. We just have to get it done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once again, the Lakers had trouble with their veteran guards.  
Harper started, and had just two points and two assists in 17 
minutes. Backup Derek Fisher left for good in the second quarter 
because of tendinitis in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Kobe Bryant was contained, held to 15 points after  
scoring 17 of his 26 in the fourth quarter Monday night in a 
117-104 victory over Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, Denver isn't Utah.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our mentality is an offensive mentality,'' Harper said. ``You  
have to think defense, especially down the stretch. We didn't come 
up with any stops and as a result, we came in second. If we are 
going to be a good basketball team, we have to find a way to make 
stops.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie point guard Tyronn Lue provided a spark, getting 12  
points and six assists in only his second game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't execute on the offensive end or the defensive end,''  
said Lue, activated from the injured list Monday. ``They picked us 
apart. Our defense didn't step up and meet the challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz controlled the boards 42-36 and outscored the Lakers  
32-18 during the fourth quarter in which Los Angeles shot just 33 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why does that not surprise me? It figures,'' said Rodman, who  
had 12 rebounds. ``If you are going to commit yourself to play 
basketball, then play basketball. If you are not going to play, 
then you should sit down and don't play. Don't even bother 
coming.''

<HEADLINE> Washington, Jefferson and Gardening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SLEEPY HOLLOW, N.Y. (AP) -- George Washington as a profit-making  
whiskey distiller was a role you might not have suspected of the 
Father of Our Country. 
</P>
<P>
	Nor might you have known him for his Potomac River fishery or as  
the designer of a 16-sided barn where horses treaded wheat. This 
building was so unique it has now been recreated at Mount Vernon 
featuring daily shows of how it worked. 
</P>
<P>
	While Rip Van Winkle was sleeping here in legend, Washington was  
fighting Hudson River Valley battles. But his thoughts turned 
constantly to his Virginia plantation. His life as a farmer rather 
than soldier was re-enacted here in this 200th anniversary year of 
his death. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate lecture at historic Philipsburg Manor, Thomas  
Jefferson was hailed as a super gardener who said ``there's not a 
shoot of grass that springs uninteresting to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two presidents' ties to the good earth were evoked by Dennis  
Pogue, director of restoration at Mount Vernon, and Peter Hatch, 
director of gardens and grounds for Monticello, Jefferson's 
Virginia home. The lectures were sponsored by the Lyndhurst site of 
the National Trust for Historic reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	Pogue said Washington went into the whiskey business when his  
Scottish plantation master convinced him that a distillery would be 
very profitable. 
</P>
<P>
	``In fact, it was,'' Pogue said. ``In the first year of  
operation, they made over $7,000.'' That would be the equivalent of 
about $63,000 today. 
</P>
<P>
	His fishery on the river, a major enterprise, was one of  
Washington's most profitable operations, Pogue said. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington, who marketed grain broadly, decided to bring his  
wheat-threshing operation indoors to a specially-designed barn 
because both the weather and theft were causing him losses 
outdoors, Pogue said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the slave labor plantations of the Chesapeake area of that  
time, wheat was either flailed by hand or laid out in a large 
circle for horses to tread on it. The action of the hooves threshed 
out the grain. 
</P>
<P>
	Unhappy with the results outdoors, Washington built a barn with  
a floor on the second level large enough to accommodate horses. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington ``conceived the innovation of leaving spaces between  
the floorboards so that the grain would fall through to the granary 
below,'' Pogue said. ``There, it could be kept stored in bins and 
sent on to the mills to be ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That barn and other farm structures have been meticulously  
recreated at Mount Vernon as part of a $3 million project. The 
American lumber industry ``helped us come remarkably close to the 
kinds of wood used in Washington's time,'' Pogue said. (Online 
essays on the reconstruction are available on www. 
mountvernon.org). 
</P>
<P>
	Washington ``worked on his farms virtually every day,'' Pogue  
said. ``He would ride around all the different farms and inspect 
them and talk to the overseers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was very much a hands-on guy. All the time he was going out  
and marking trees that needed to be cut down or relocated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two days before he died in 1799, he had been marking trees and  
came down with strep throat that killed him, Pogue said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson, long celebrated for his Monticello farming and  
gardening, was pictured in Hatch's lecture as seeing ``plants as a 
vehicle for social intercourse, as a way of relating to people. 
</P>
<P>
	``Throughout his gardening letters there is this sort of union  
of gardening and sociability, particularly in his letters to his 
daughters and granddaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole family would get together to plant tulip bulbs and  
hyacinth bulbs. Jefferson's job was to label the plants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch said Jefferson suggested adding gardening to the fine arts  
not as horticulture ``but as the art of embellishing grounds by 
fancy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``As a young man, he dreamed up futuristic and romantic grottos.  
He also had plans for cascading waterfalls and fish ponds.'' Hatch 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson pictured flower seasons as acts in a play, the tulips  
doing their acts and receiving their applause, to be followed by 
the iris and then the lilies, Hatch said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Jefferson referred to the flowers themselves ``as being  
what he called the belles of the day, who after flowering retired 
to the more interesting office of reproducing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A great grower of vegetables and flowers, Jefferson also set out  
1,400 fruit trees in the south orchard alone, Hatch said. He 
explained that for most Americans before 1850 horticulture meant 
fruit growing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pioneers began planting their orchards before building their  
houses,'' he said. One reason was the importance of peach brandy 
and apple cider. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans began drinking the fruit rather than eating it,''  
Hatch said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ex-Rebels Shine for Blazers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Nearly a decade after UNLV's Runnin'  
Rebels ran roughshod over college basketball, two stars from that 
team find themselves in pursuit of another championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Anthony and Stacey Augmon are still the best defenders on  
their team, but their roles are decidedly different as reserves for 
the Portland Trail Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
	They have emerged from a crowded Blazers roster to become the  
crunch-time leaders for a team with the NBA's best record (27-6). 
</P>
<P>
	Often they're playing crucial minutes in the fourth quarter  
while starting guards Damon Stoudamire and Isaiah Rider -- and their 
combined annual salaries of $13.8 million -- ride the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were two of the best defensive players we ever had,''  
said former UNLV coach Jerry Tarkanian, who coached Anthony and 
Augmon when the Rebels won the national title in 1990. ``It started 
with Greg pressuring the ball, and Stacey taking the other team's 
best scorer out of the game. They were two tough guys. They 
understand what hard work meant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last Saturday, in a hard-fought 98-93 victory over Phoenix,  
Anthony scored a season-high 17 points and Augmon hit two big shots 
late, including a jumper with 1:53 left that put the Blazers ahead 
for good. Stoudamire sat the final 15:40 of the game, Rider the 
last 16:34. 
</P>
<P>
	The night before against Seattle, Anthony held Gary Payton  
scoreless for the first seven minutes of the fourth quarter, and 
Augmon had two steals in the period as the Blazers forced 10 
Seattle turnovers and went on to win 107-95. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps their best late-game performance was in a victory over  
the Philadelphia 76ers on March 21, when Anthony scored 11 of his 
13 points in the fourth quarter and contained Allen Iverson, the 
league's leading scorer. Augmon, meanwhile, had season highs of 10 
points and seven rebounds and shut down Sixers point guard Eric 
Snow. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had four or five possessions in a row where, boom, boom,  
boom, they steal and we score,'' Portland coach Mike Dunleavy said. 
``It was tremendous. Back in the old days with the Knicks and Walt 
Frazier, they would come up with big steals. Still, I don't know 
that I saw a sequence like that, the way they just totally 
dominated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The newfound success comes for players who are only a couple  
years removed from NBA obscurity. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony, 31, was drafted by New York in 1991 and stayed there  
for four years, but then was shipped to Vancouver in the 1995 
expansion draft. He put up his best numbers, averaging 11.8 points 
and 6.6 assists, but the Grizzlies won just 29 games in his two 
seasons there. 
</P>
<P>
	After a year backing up Payton in Seattle, he signed with  
Portland for the $1 million salary-cap exception, making Anthony 
one of the season's great bargains. 
</P>
<P>
	Augmon's career was revived when he was traded to the Blazers  
from Detroit in 1997. He had been a five-year starter for Atlanta, 
but was dealt to Detroit and traded six months later after a 
shouting match with fiery coach Doug Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	Augmon, 30, averaged just 4.7 points in 71 games last season,  
and his scoring has bottomed out to a career-low 3.9 points this 
year. But he's started seven of the last 12 games at small forward, 
giving the Blazers an aggressive presence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stacey's built to defend,'' Anthony said. ``He's got those  
long arms and great agility. He's a prototype defender. He's just 
very disruptive. He's not the kind of guy you want on you at crunch 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony said he and Augmon have learned to anticipate each  
other's moves on the court, and that the Blazers as a team are 
beginning to think alike. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to take the floor expecting to win,'' he said. ``We  
are approaching that.''

<HEADLINE> Anti-Gay Attacks Said More Violent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Anti-gay attacks in the United States dropped 4  
percent last year, but the assaults were more violent and led to 
more hospitalizations, an advocacy group says. 
</P>
<P>
	A report by the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs  
released Tuesday showed the number of attacks dropped from 2,665 in 
1997 to 2,552 in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the number of victims requiring inpatient  
hospitalization more than doubled, from 53 in 1997 to 110 last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The group also reported a 71 percent rise in assaults and  
attempted assaults with guns. Incidents in which bats, clubs and 
other blunt objects were used rose by 47 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``What this may be indicating is that perpetrators are getting  
bolder, and their actions are becoming more premeditated, since ... 
you have to make a decision to leave your house with a baseball 
bat,'' said Richard Haymes, executive director of the Anti-Violence 
Project. 
</P>
<P>
	The group highlighted several cases, in particular the murder  
last fall of gay college student Matthew Shepard in Wyoming. The 
slaying prompted calls for legislative change nationally and in 
Wyoming, one of eight states without a hate crimes law. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Henderson pleaded guilty Monday to kidnapping and felony  
murder in the case. Co-defendant Aaron McKinney still faces a 
murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The report covered recorded incidents of anti-gay violence in 16  
regions across the country. It came on the same day that President 
Clinton asked Congress to expand federal hate crimes law to include 
offenses based on sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
	Haymes applauded Clinton's proposal.  
</P>
<P>
	``In New York state, for example, there are 502 jurisdictions  
that could report bias crimes, and currently only 35 do because 
it's not mandatory,'' Haymes said. ``Multiply that kind of 
underreporting nationally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the severity of anti-gay violence rose last year, the  
report said, police response ``did not rise as much in 
consequence'' in terms of bias crime classification, arrests and 
processing of complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	The report suggested a national study of hate-motivated  
violence, harsher penalties at the state level for hate crimes and 
federal funding for law enforcement to states that pass hate crime 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also recommended increasing the hiring of gay police  
officers and establishing anti-bias units in every police force. 
</P>
<P>
	The coalition is a voluntary network of 26 community-based  
organizations.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft To Stay in Charlotte </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. on Tuesday rejected thoughts of  
moving its East Coast technical support center to South Carolina 
and will search for a new Charlotte site. 
</P>
<P>
	``Microsoft has decided it will look at real estate  
opportunities in North Carolina,'' company spokesman Dan Leach 
said. ``It was an exceptionally difficult decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Redmond, Wash.-based software giant said it planned to pick  
a site in the Charlotte area this summer and occupy new quarters by 
fall 2000 for its East Coast Product Support Center, which now 
employs nearly 1,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Leach refused to characterize Microsoft's plans as expansion.  
Gov. Jim Hunt's office said the company is searching for 325,000 
square feet of office space for expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's center is currently housed in five buildings near  
the Charlotte Coliseum. It is facing expiring leases and new 
product releases later this year, The Charlotte Observer reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Leach declined to specify South Carolina sites Microsoft had  
considered. He praised South Carolina's vision for developing the 
Interstate 77 corridor between Charlotte and Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's Charlotte employees were told of the decision at  
meetings Tuesday, Leach said.

<HEADLINE> Elderly Tell of High Drug Costs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Jo Sayward, 78, thought she might save some money  
if she asked her doctor for a less expensive medication for her 
cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why don't you give me something else?'' she told the doctor.  
</P>
<P>
	She tried an alternative -- with poor results. After three  
months, her cholesterol had shot up so high her doctor called her a 
``walking time bomb.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, she says, ``I have to go back, unless I want to die'' -- to  
the old medicine that cost $400 for every prescription refill. 
</P>
<P>
	Sayward's story was just one of many harrowing tales of high  
prescription costs for the elderly told at a recent Statehouse 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	How did the prescription crisis arise?  
</P>
<P>
	Medicare patients, who are entitled to health care because they  
are 65 and over, can either use a traditional health insurance plan 
or they can join a Medicare HMO. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, there were about 211,500 elderly people in Medicare  
HMOs in Massachusetts, about a quarter of the total people eligible 
for Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts had a unique law requiring the HMOs to offer at  
least one plan that provided unlimited prescription drug coverage, 
but a federal judge in Boston ruled in October that, under federal 
law, the HMOs didn't have to provide that plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The major HMOs -- Tufts, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, Fallon  
Community Health Plan, and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of 
Massachusetts -- have now instituted limited drug benefits and 
special plans to help low-income people pay for their drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	But Geoff Wilkinson, executive director of the Massachusetts  
Senior Action Council, estimated that perhaps 15,000 elderly 
residents are going to have to pay more because their drug costs 
exceed the limited benefits offered by the HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
	Some will have to pay a little more; others, like a woman who  
estimated her yearly drug expenses at $10,000, could have to pay a 
lot more. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State William Galvin, who has been nettled by the  
HMOs' withdrawal of the benefit, called the situation a ``public 
health crisis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Attorney General Thomas Reilly said he plans to launch an  
examination of pricing and sales practices of pharmaceutical 
companies in Massachusetts. His office will report its findings 
later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're up against an avalanche that we cannot hold back, the  
rising price of drugs,'' said Reilly, whose office is fighting to 
reverse the federal ruling on unlimited prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Trewhitt, a spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Researchers  
and Manufacturers of America, said drug prices were high because 
they reflected the rising price of developing new drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Like other witnesses at the hearing, Reilly said he supported  
loosening the eligibility requirements and increasing the benefits 
from an existing state program that provides prescription help to 
low-income elderly people. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Harriette Chandler, the House chairman of the Health Care  
Committee, said she supported that, as well as a ``catastrophic'' 
drug program that would cover people, even those with moderate 
incomes, if they face massive prescription costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Patty Blake, vice president in charge of the Tufts Health Plan  
Medicare HMO, applauded the committee's discussion of government 
help in paying for prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's really a positive step forward,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Blake said, however, the ``root cause'' was that Medicare  
doesn't cover prescription drugs.

<HEADLINE> Real Estate Co. Settles ADA Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department announced Wednesday  
that a Toronto-based real estate company agreed to pay a nonprofit 
organization and the federal government $560,000 to settle a 
dispute alleging it discriminated against people with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	TrizecHahn has agreed to pay $550,000 to the EndDependence  
Center and $10,000 in civil penalties to the government, said 
Allison Nichol, deputy chief of the Justice Department's 
Disabilities Rights Section. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichol said the EndDependence Center, an independent living  
center for people with disabilities, filed a complaint against 
TrizecHahn last year for allegedly refusing to lease the 
organization space in its suburban Arlington, Va., building. 
</P>
<P>
	``They refused to negotiate with the center,'' Nichol said.  
``The reason was they didn't want people with disabilities in their 
building.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nichol said anecdotal evidence indicates groups who work with  
people with disabilities often have problems renting commercial 
space, but she said people are often hesitant to file complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes people don't know it's discrimination,'' she said.  
``It may be discrimination with a smile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms of the agreement reached Wednesday, TrizecHahn  
did not admit wrongdoing but promised not to discriminate when 
leasing space. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also agreed to instruct employees on the  
requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act that pertain to 
the leasing of commercial real estate. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was an isolated incident. It in no way reflects  
TrizecHahn's corporate values or policies. In fact, the Department 
of Justice determined that their finding was not based on any 
pattern or practice of discrimination by our company, said Tabb 
Davis, a spokeswoman for the company. She said it made every effort 
to deal with the allegation quickly and to cooperate with the 
Department of Justice fully.

<HEADLINE> Macedonia Criticizes NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLACE, Macedonia (AP) -- Macedonian authorities early today  
emptied a border enclave where tens of thousands of Kosovo refugees 
had been trapped for days in squalid, chaotic conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Macedonia had been busing refugees out of the teeming Blace camp  
for days, but the pace was sharply stepped up late Tuesday and 
early today. Many of the Blace refugees, who had numbered in the 
tens of thousands the day before, were taken to NATO-run camps, but 
aid workers scrambled to track the others. 
</P>
<P>
	The fate of a miles-long line of ethnic Albanian refugees who  
had been waiting on the other side of Macedonia's frontier with 
Yugoslavia was not known, and there were fears they had been turned 
back to Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The move to swiftly empty the Blace (pronounced blah-TSAY)  
encampment came against a backdrop of growing tensions between 
Western aid and alliance officials and authorities in Macedonia, a 
former Yugoslav republic. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Macedonia's prime minister, Llubco Georgievski,  
criticized NATO as ``completely irresponsible'' for ignoring 
warnings that airstrikes on Yugoslavia could trigger a humanitarian 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations and other Western aid agencies, for their  
part, have accused Macedonia of using bureaucratic delays to slow 
the influx of both refugees and aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Macedonia, flooded with more than 130,000 refugees since the  
NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia began two weeks ago, has 
said it can take in 20,000 and wants the rest quickly shipped to 
other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Macedonia fears the flood of refugees will destabilize its  
ethnic balance and lead to calls for Albanian autonomy in this 
country of 2.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Paramilitary police kept journalists at a distance today from  
what had been a sprawling encampment. All that remained at the site 
was a giant, smoldering pit, with garbage fires burning and muddy 
clothing and plastic sheeting strewn about. 
</P>
<P>
	Filthy, primitive conditions in the camp had led to an outbreak  
of illness and some deaths in recent days. Serbian troops and 
police have been accused of forcing the refugees out of their homes 
in Kosovo, sending many on arduous treks by foot to the border. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who made it into Macedonia said they believed people on  
the Yugoslav side of the border at Blace, where a line of waiting 
cars stretched for 6 miles, had been pushed back into Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``People saw them being turned back,'' said Rronn Qena, 20, a  
Kosovar painter who arrived at a NATO-run tent camp at Stankovac, a 
suburb of the Macedonian capital, Skopje. 
</P>
<P>
	An Associated Press Television News crew at another crossing,  
Jazince, saw empty Yugoslav buses waiting on the other side of the 
border, apparently preparing to transport refugees from the border 
back into Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Aid workers arriving early today at the emptied Blace site said  
they were trying to track where refugees had been taken. 
</P>
<P>
	Paula Ghedini, a spokeswoman for the U.N. refugee agency, said  
about 15,000 of the refugees from Blace had been taken to a transit 
camp near Macedonia's capital but officials were not sure what 
happened to the others. 
</P>
<P>
	In Albania, a spokesman for the Organization for Security and  
Cooperation in Europe, Andrea Angeli, said about 10,000 Kosovo 
refugees had been transported overnight from Macedonia into 
Albania. It was not known whether any were the same refugees taken 
from the Blace camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Western aid agencies, meanwhile, were looking into reports that  
Macedonia may be forcing Kosovo Albanians to leave the country in a 
Western-organized airlift. 
</P>
<P>
	Flights to Norway and Turkey that began Monday have carried out  
only a few thousand refugees. Another planeload of refugees landed 
in Norway today with 78 refugees, including about 20 children. 
</P>
<P>
	Macedonian authorities also have apparently discouraged the  
reunion of any arriving ethnic Albanian refugees with relatives in 
Macedonia. Refugee Nebi Qena, 21, said he had family in the former 
Yugoslav republic, but his relatives had not been allowed to visit 
the camp where he was staying. 
</P>
<P>
	In a news release late Tuesday, the government hinted it would  
take steps to ensure any arrivals did not stay long. It said they 
would go directly to camps ``where they will be transferred to 
other countries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-NATO sentiment has been growing among Macedonian  
nationalists angry at both the airstrikes against fellow Orthodox 
Serbs and the refugee inflow. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO troops in Macedonia have been working day and night to set  
up nine tent cities to temporarily house refugees. The alliance 
said it had ferried into Macedonia more than 1,373 tons of aid, 
including 350 tons of food and water and 250 tons of tents and 
other supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Private and military aircraft were scheduled to begin flying  
Kosovo refugees today from Macedonia to Germany, which has promised 
to provide temporary shelter to 10,000.

<HEADLINE> Symantec Chief Goes To Oblix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) -- After 15 years as chairman of Symantec  
Corp., Gordon Eubanks is resigning to become CEO of Oblix Inc., a 
maker of business directory software. 
</P>
<P>
	Eubanks said Tuesday that he will stay with Symantec until a  
successor is found. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oblix is a pioneer that has tremendous potential and upside,''  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eubanks, 52, announced in January that he was launching a search  
for his own successor to take over the day-to-day operations of 
Symantec, maker of the Norton brand of computer utilities software. 
</P>
<P>
	Eubanks, who wants to bring in an executive from outside the  
company, said the search is still on and would not say when he 
would step down or move to Oblix. 
</P>
<P>
	The privately held Oblix, based in Mountain View, is a  
3-year-old company that produces automated software that is used by 
corporations like Kinko's and Hitachi to keep track of employees 
and services over a network. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Todd Chipman of Giga Information Group said Oblix is a  
pioneer in the field of directory software, which will be an 
increasingly important product as companies turn to electronic 
commerce for revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gordon Eubanks brings instant clout to Oblix,'' Chipman said.  
``It is an absolute grand slam for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eubanks founded C&AMP;E Software in 1983, and that company purchased  
Symantec in 1984.

<HEADLINE> Baby I'm Only 'Society's Child' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cradling the huge guitar, she looked prim in her  
blue turtleneck, white A-line jumper that brushed the tops of her 
knees, black tights and low-heel, pointy-toe black pumps with 
buckles. Her long, dark curly hair was parted and tied back, as if 
to tame it. Then she let loose her dangerous song. 
</P>
<P>
	``Come to my door, baby. Face is clean and shining, black as  
night. ... She called you 'boy' instead of your name!'' Janis Ian's 
sweet, strong soprano achingly sang out that she was ``only 
society's child.'' After mom, teachers and friends let her know a 
white girl must not cherish a black boy, she was resigned: ``I 
don't want to see you anymore, baby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This was no mere folk song. With her grief-stricken hymn to love  
crushed by bigotry, the white teen-ager indicted America for its 
racism and hypocrisy. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the 1960s, a time of race riots and civil rights  
struggles, and right before the U.S. Supreme Court struck down 
state laws that barred interracial marriage. The song brought a 
rash of hate mail and many radio stations would not play it. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``Society's Child'' also attracted more positive things.  
Leonard Bernstein, composer, conductor and music teacher to a 
nation expressed only awe when he presented Ian on national 
television April 25, 1967, in a CBS special, ``Inside Pop: The Rock 
Revolution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That voice! Those words! That key change!'' Bernstein gushed.  
``Oh Janis, how did you ever write such a thing at the age of 15? 
You're a great creature!'' Predicting ``a brilliant career,'' he 
delicately lifted her hand to his lips for a kiss. 
</P>
<P>
	This past January, on a chilly night sticky with fog, Janis Ian  
stood alone on the stage of a Jewish community center in Whippany, 
N.J. Deep in the suburbs 25 miles from New York City, she took 
another step in what has become one long, continuous comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, you look friendly,'' she said with a nervous smile.  
Gaunt and fragile-looking at 47, she was still recovering from 
surgery to excise a benign tumor from her liver. ``I haven't done a 
show in two months,'' she told the mostly fortysomething audience 
of 350. 
</P>
<P>
	The voice is deeper, and richer. In performance she drapes her 4  
feet 10 inches in an oversized black T-shirt that declares 
``Godlike'' in white letters. Underneath, she wears shiny black 
leggings and black high-heel sneakers. Her curly hair is short and 
brushed out to frame her somber, intense face. She breaks into a 
radiant grin only when the audience applauds -- and it's always 
huge, thundering applause. 
</P>
<P>
	Ian's audiences stretch over generations. Some come out of  
nostalgia; they bring their teen-agers and grandchildren. Others 
are just discovering her. 
</P>
<P>
	Still best known is her biggest hit, ``At Seventeen.'' Released  
in 1975, her frank reflection on adolescence has proved so durable 
and true, its wordsare still recited by gray-haired women and 
balding men: ``I learned the truth at 17, that love was meant for 
beauty queens ... those of us with ravaged faces, lacking in the 
social graces, desperately remained at home, inventing lovers on 
the phone, who called to say come dance with me. ... It isn't all 
it seems, at 17.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There have been many more songs, including tunes for TV  
commercials and movies. Writing words and music has been her only 
constant in a turbulent life. That, and her courage. She has walked 
away from fame, twice. She survived a suicide attempt, a stormy 
marriage and ugly divorce, frail health, the theft of her childhood 
guitar, financial ruin and her mother's slow death from multiple 
sclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
	And she started over in Nashville, Tenn., where she has found  
enduring love with another woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaking off a touch of rust on the high notes, Ian opened the  
Whippany show with ``This Train Still Runs'': ``It doesn't matter 
where it's gone, this train still runs. And though the baggage 
weighs a ton, we carry on. Nothing is forever young -- I'm not done. 
This train still runs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Janis Ian was back.  
</P>
<P>
	Two days later she played Madison Square Garden, one of eight  
performers in a benefit concert for Zero Population Growth that 
included Jewel, Paula Cole, Odetta and Phoebe Snow. She got a 
standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	A few weeks later, she was back in New York City for the 25th  
anniversary show at The Bottom Line, a Greenwich Village relic from 
the folk scene heyday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be really happy if I could write songs the rest of my  
life, and do little concerts, and other people would record my 
songs,'' Ian said in an interview. Wearing dark sweat pants and a 
roomy shirt the color of lilacs, she sat on a chair in a hotel near 
Wall Street. Ruby-colored eyeglasses set off her brown eyes. Smoke 
from her pungent cigarettes -- a pricey brand free of additives -- 
drifted around the small, plain room. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite her Buddha-like composure, her conversation leapt  
between clipped replies and chatty streams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't need to be playing for 20,000 people,'' she said.  
``I'd be very happy to have another hit record. ... But I'm not 
going to spend the next 20 years spinning my wheels. ... This is a 
harsh business that I'm in, and it gets harsher every year. '' 
</P>
<P>
	Janis Ian was never society's child.  
</P>
<P>
	Born Janis Fink, a granddaughter of Russian immigrants, she  
spent her first years on the New Jersey chicken farm where her 
father grew up and worked until he became a music teacher. Her 
parents were patriotic Americans and fervent socialists, agitating 
for equality, whether it was voting rights or fair wages. Their 
activities filled FBI files. As a result, she said, her father was 
denied tenure in public schools and they moved a lot. 
</P>
<P>
	Brave and single-minded, at age 2 1/2 she connected her father to  
the sound coming from their piano when he played ``Clair de Lune.'' 
She wanted lessons. Her father insisted she first learn the 
alphabet, count to 10 and tell time. Piano lessons led to the 
organ, flute and French horn. 
</P>
<P>
	Even her name had to be her own making. She discarded Fink, for  
the middle name of her younger brother, Eric. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 she picked up her father's guitar, a battered Martin D-18  
he had bought in 1948 from a farmer's widow for $25. In a few years 
her song, ``Hair of Spun Gold,'' was published in the folk magazine 
Broadside. 
</P>
<P>
	Living in East Orange, N.J., she was part of a small white  
minority when she wrote ``Society's Child.'' It wasn't 
autobiographical or based on anyone she knew, just her response to 
a world in social agony. It grabbed the attention of a record 
producer in New York City, where she had become a regular on the 
folk scene. He put ``Society's Child'' out as a single. 
</P>
<P>
	By now she was a sophomore at New York's competitive High School  
of Music &AMP; Art. But she quit when she turned 16. ``It wasn't for 
me. I don't like organizations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heroes like Paul Revere were her standard. Her parents  
encouraged their daughter's spirit and potential. She credits them 
with her self-confidence, and with the honesty of her songs. 
</P>
<P>
	They ``never punished me for telling the truth, no matter how  
awful it was. I was punished for lying -- and you can't be a hero 
and lie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That honesty, its eloquence and depth may be her chief legacy to  
contemporary music. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, as a writer, I have very meager strengths,'' she said.  
``I don't write great choruses. I don't have the gift of an Irving 
Berlin, you know, to just write something that everyone can sing. I 
don't have the gift for simplicity of a lot of country writers I 
know have. But I do honesty really well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the time she fell under Leonard Bernstein's adoring gaze, she  
had begun touring. From ``The Tonight Show'' to Time magazine she 
was a sensation. Her debut album, ``Janis Ian,'' won the first of 
seven Grammy Award nominations. 
</P>
<P>
	There were also hard lessons, and frightening, ugly moments. She  
was 16 and playing Escondido, Calif., whena group in the audience 
screamed racial obscenities. Upset, she left the stage. The 
promoter found her crying in the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, 'I'm not going back out there.' ... And the promoter  
looked at me and said, 'You've got to go back out there. If you 
don't go back out, they've won.' '' She went back on stage and 
picked up where she left off. 
</P>
<P>
	Making her solitary way in the world cost heavily, though. At 17  
she suffered a nervous breakdown and attempted suicide with pills. 
Her parents were getting a divorce, she was having difficulties 
with the record producer. She checked out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to go to sleep 'til it was over and then wake up  
different. I think that's what most kids who try that want. You 
don't want to die, you just want things to stop for a while, until 
you can cope with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In psychotherapy, she began to pull herself together, almost  
literally. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until then I was all these different people: I was this  
songwriter. I was this hero to a generation. I was this publicity 
machine. I was this recording artist. I was this kid on TV. I was 
my parents' daughter, I was my brother's sister, I was my 
boyfriend's girlfriend. It was all very confusing.'' Therapy helped 
her integrate all those facets of her life. 
</P>
<P>
	She had given much of her money to charity and needy friends.  
``When you're that young, you figure you could always make more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Broke, barely out of her teens and already washed up, she was  
living with her mother when she read a New York Times article about 
a debutante. It began, she recalls, ``I learned the truth at 18.'' 
The result several months later was the autobiographical ``At 
Seventeen.'' Her first comeback was about to begin. 
</P>
<P>
	Her early 20s produced three popular albums: ``Stars'' (1973),  
with the ballad ``Jesse,'' later a hit for Roberta Flack; ``Between 
the Lines'' (1975), which featured ``At Seventeen''; and 
``Aftertones'' (1976). 
</P>
<P>
	``At Seventeen'' sold more than 1 million copies and earned a  
Grammy for best pop vocal performance of 1975. It also got her a 
spot on the inaugural ``NBC's Saturday Night'' -- later renamed 
``Saturday Night Live'' -- her sober songs an odd if moving contrast 
to the wackiness of George Carlin, John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd and 
Jane Curtin. 
</P>
<P>
	Based at various times in Los Angeles, Philadelphia and New  
York, through much of the 1970s she lived out of suitcases, touring 
the world and pouring out albums. She fell in love with a longtime 
friend and married in 1978, hoping to raise a family. 
</P>
<P>
	Then in 1982, ending a tour in South Africa, she took a break.  
No records. No shows. Then the troubles started. The hiatus would 
lapse into a decade. Janis Ian vanished. 
</P>
<P>
	She studied acting, ballet and piano. But this was also when her  
marriage soured, ending in divorce after a decade. And suspicion 
that she couldn't bear children was confirmed; the cause was 
massive fibroids, and at 35 she had a hysterectomy. 
</P>
<P>
	Her former accountant, now dead, had stopped paying her taxes in  
1979, and the IRS caught up with her in 1986. At the time, Ian was 
hospitalized in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., with a burst intestine. The 
IRS shut down her bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Good in business, she had made lucrative real estate buys and  
smart stock market investments. The problem was being on the road 
10 months of the year, leaving someone else to pay bills. 
</P>
<P>
	She owed the IRS $1.2 million, New York State $350,000, debts  
she finally paid off last year. It meant liquidating what she 
could, selling instruments and even rights to her songs. And 
slowly, she laid the ground for another comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	Ready for a spell of composing, she was living in Los Angeles in  
1986 when a music publisher recommended Nashville. The town teems 
with professional songwriters and this folk artist with a jazzy 
bent found there a haven of kindred artists. Two years later, she 
made the move permanent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's made me a lot simpler, made me a lot cleaner writer, less  
inclined to go off and wander,'' she said of her new hometown. 
``It's forced me to develop my craft.'' In that Southern city, 
she's ``just another grunt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nashville was also where 10 years ago she met her love, Pat  
Snyder. The warm, quiet and witty redhead offered company with 
chess games when Ian was emerging from a six-month bout of chronic 
fatigue syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon they moved in together. Ian put Snyder, a former university  
archivist, through law school, just as she paid for the education 
of her mother, Pearl Yadoff, who in middle-age earned undergraduate 
and graduate degrees from Goddard College. She died in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Once Ian was back on her feet, albums and concerts followed  
early in this decade. She counts 300 songs to her credit. She's 
also been branching out. 
</P>
<P>
	She gives master classes to college musicians. Venturing into  
prose, she become a columnist, first for a gay magazine, The 
Advocate, and now for a trade journal, The Professional Songwriter. 
She has a website, and a company, Rude Girl Inc., that sells her 
songbook and T-shirts and imports her CDs from Europe to sell at 
lower cost. As she turned 48 on April 7, she was in Los Angeles 
recording her 17th album, for Windham Hill Records. 
</P>
<P>
	And she got her Martin D-18 back.  
</P>
<P>
	The venerable 1937 guitar on which she wrote ``Society's Child''  
and ``Jesse,'' the instrument she used to wow Leonard Bernstein, 
was stolen from her apartment soon after she moved to Los Angeles 
in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	She posted wanted notices on her albums. Then last year, an  
e-mail arrived. A guitar shop in California had a customer. The 
customer had her guitar, identified by its serial number. He had 
bought it from a store in Berkeley, Calif., 26 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, she seldom lets the guitar out of sight. ``It sleeps in  
the bedroom with me,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	With her life in a pleasant equilibrium, Ian spends mornings  
doing business, afternoons writing. For fun she reads, and watches 
``King of the Hill'' and ``The X-Files.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And she contemplates taking new, bold directions and satisfying  
old hankerings, like performing at Radio City Music Hall, nailing a 
writing gig at Time or Newsweek or starting her autobiography. And 
then there's her dream of teaming with Paul McCartney or Billy 
Joel. 
</P>
<P>
	Janis Ian once thanked her mother for indulging her daughter's  
ambition for stardom and fame. Her mother replied: ``We had no 
choice. Nothing would have stopped you.''

<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Youngsters convicted of murder could  
now face life in prison under a new state law passed in response to 
last year's deadly school shooting in Jonesboro. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Mike Huckabee signed the measure on Wednesday. Under the  
new law, children of any age who are convicted of first-degree 
murder can receive adult punishment, including life in prison, but 
not the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	State law previously protected children under 14 from facing  
adult punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of that, Mitchell Johnson, then 13, and Andrew Golden,  
then 11, were sentenced to a juvenile detention center for the 
Jonesboro shootings and must be released by the time they turn 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Four students and a teacher were killed in the March 24, 1998,  
shootings at Westside Middle School.

<HEADLINE> Dem. Fund-Raiser Sought By House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House committee investigating Democratic  
fund raising in the 1996 campaign wants to hear from Johnny Chung, 
who says he funneled illegal contributions from China to help 
re-elect President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that it is in the public interest for the facts  
about Chinese government efforts to subvert our elections to be 
brought to light,'' said Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the 
House Government Reform and Oversight Committee. ``The American 
people have a right to know the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burton made his comments Wednesday in a letter to Attorney  
General Janet Reno, seeking her help in getting Chung to testify at 
a public hearing of the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that we must act to restore the confidence of the  
American people that their interests are being protected,'' Burton 
wrote. ``It is imperative that we shine the light of day on the 
facts surrounding Chinese government involvement in funneling 
public money into our political system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department officials did not return a call seeking  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung reportedly has told federal investigators that China's  
chief military intelligence officer sent him $300,000 to give to 
the Democratic Party. The Chinese government has denied the 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Chung said he received $300,000 from a Chinese  
aerospace official, Liu Chao-ying, who also is a lieutenant colonel 
in the Chinese army. Chung told prosecutors that Ms. Liu, whose 
company is owned by the Chinese government, told him that the funds 
came from Chinese intelligence and were for political 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from both the Clinton campaign and the Democratic  
National Committee have said they did not know of any connection 
between Chung's contributions and the Chinese government. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung, a Taiwanese-born businessman who is now a U.S. citizen,  
donated nearly $400,000 to Democratic candidates and causes from 
1994 to 1996, but the money was returned after questions arose 
about its legality. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been a frequent visitor to the White House, once  
escorting Chinese businessmen to watch Clinton deliver a radio 
address. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung admitted making nearly $30,000 in illegal contributions to  
Democrats, including $20,000 to Clinton's re-election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	In December he was sentenced to five years probation and 3,000  
hours of community service as part of a plea bargain. He also has 
been cooperating with the Justice Department campaign finance task 
force.

<HEADLINE> Guard El-Amin To Return to UConn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Khalid El-Amin is passing up a shot at  
the NBA draft and will reurn for his junior year, hoping to lead 
Connecticut to another national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-foot-10 point guard helped the Huskies (36-2) to their  
first national championship with a 77-74 victory over Duke last 
week. It was the school's first trip to the Final Four in 21 tries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think doing it a second time would be even better,'' El-Amin  
said. ``I want to come back and try to relive the great memories 
and experiences we all shared in the recent NCAA championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very interested in playing with a different group of guys  
... and helping introduce them to the highest level of college 
basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the past three years, the end of basketball season has meant  
decision time for the portly sophomore from Minneapolis, a married 
man with two children. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jim Calhoun said the extra year will allow El-Amin to  
further develop. 
</P>
<P>
	``Khalid obviously played a major role in our national  
championship journey,'' Calhoun said. ``I believe he will enjoy an 
even more dynamic year as he expands his wonderful leadership 
qualities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scoring leader Richard Hamilton still was considering whether to  
return for his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gave me no indication about any kind of announcement  
anytime soon,'' Calhoun said. ``He's enjoying the fruits of his 
accomplishment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	El-Amin has been a starter in 71 games and became the third  
UConn player to reach 1,000 points as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past two seasons, he has averaged 14.9 points and 4.1  
assists. He finished second on the team this season in scoring at 
13.8 points a game and led the squad in assists with 140. 
</P>
<P>
	El-Amin was placed on the Final Four all-tournament team after  
scoring 30 points and dishing out 10 assists in victories over Ohio 
State in the semifinals and Duke in the title game.

<HEADLINE> Study: Amazon Forest Fading Faster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Brazil's Amazon rain forest is being destroyed or badly damaged  
more than twice as fast as normally believed, according to a study 
that relied on airplane surveys and on-the-ground interviews 
instead of satellite images. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers said their method more accurately measured the  
effects of logging and burning in the 1.3 million-square-mile rain 
forest. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's perhaps even more frightening,'' said Bill Mankin,  
director of the Global Forest Policy Project of two major 
environmental groups. ``It's going to creep up on us, and people 
may not even be crafting a solution because they don't realize 
there's a problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study was carried out largely by ecologist Daniel C. Nepstad  
of the Woods Hole Research Center in Massachusetts, and colleagues 
at the Institute of Environmental Research in Belem, Brazil. They 
interviewed 1,393 wood mill operators and 202 landholders, and 
checked the effect of fires from an airplane at 1,104 sample 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Their findings were published in Thursday's issue of the journal  
Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	They concluded that analysts who study satellite images -- the  
main tool for gauging deforestation -- are missing much of the 
damage from logging and fires set to clear land for farming or 
pasture. Selective logging is difficult to detect by satellite, and 
new growth quickly hides fire damage as viewed from above. 
</P>
<P>
	Nepstad put the loss at 17,000 square miles last year, or three  
times the official Brazilian estimate of 5,700. But 1998 was an 
especially bad year because of an El Nino drought. He estimated 
that in an average year, actual damage is at least twice the 
official, satellite-based estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	Nepstad estimated that 217,000 square miles, or 16 percent, of  
the original rain forest has been spoiled over the years. The 
official Brazilian estimate is 13 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``All these estimates are quite conservative. The problem could  
be bigger,'' Nepstad said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no comment Wednesday from environmental authorities in  
the Brazilian government. Environment Minister Jose Sarney Filho 
was in Paris and unavailable for comment, his office said. Eduardo 
Martins, head of Brazil's environmental protection agency, said he 
had not seen the study and declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings trouble some scientists and environmentalists  
because perhaps a third of the world's plant and animal species 
live in the rain forest. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we lose species, we don't know which one is the critical  
one, the keystone species that results in the whole system falling 
apart,'' said Robert L. Sanford Jr., a University of Denver 
ecologist. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers also worry about huge quantities of carbon  
dioxide entering the atmosphere from the fires and rotting wood 
left by loggers. Carbon dioxide is thought to cause global warming. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, some scientists fear that damage to the rain forest, which  
gives off enormous amounts of water vapor and keeps the ground from 
drying out, could throw the Earth's climate out of balance. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers called for more judicious logging, more  
prevention of accidental fires, and curbs on roads, power grids and 
water systems. 
</P>
<P>
	But some experts are doubtful about the prospects of controlling  
development in the rain forest, where the law of the jungle often 
prevails. 
</P>
<P>
	``How can you control development in an area where there's no  
control? It is the Wild West,'' said Compton Tucker, a NASA 
biologist.

<HEADLINE> Defense Rests in Lakers' Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- The Los Angeles Lakers are defenseless  
on their home court against the Utah Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
	And that might not bode well come playoff time, assuming the  
teams meet. 
</P>
<P>
	With everyone doing his own thing, the Lakers lost 106-93  
Tuesday night to the team that swept them in last season's Western 
Conference finals. The Jazz have beaten the Lakers twice at the 
Forum this season, with Los Angeles winning once in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	``They started falling asleep and coming up with their own  
system of how to play defense instead of sticking to what we had in 
mind,'' Lakers coach Kurt Rambis said. ``They weren't focused, 
weren't concentrating on what we had to do defensively.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Karl Malone scored 30 points, hitting all 12 of his  
field goal attempts, and Shandon Anderson burned Los Angeles' 
defense for 12 points in the fourth quarter. Anderson repeatedly 
drove for layups the Lakers couldn't stop. 
</P>
<P>
	``Defense is where we are breaking down,'' Lakers guard Derek  
Harper said. ``When you are playing catchup against a team like 
Utah in the fourth quarter, you are really, really going to be in 
trouble. That's where we were. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until we can get defensive stops, we are not going to be able  
to beat the elite teams,'' Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaquille O'Neal led the Lakers with 24 points, but was rendered  
nearly useless in the second half because of five fouls, and scored 
just three points in the final 24 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal and Dennis Rodman were hit with technical fouls.  
</P>
<P>
	``We need to stick with the team rather than try to do stuff on  
our own,'' O'Neal said. ``We had a lack of concentration, a lack of 
mental toughness. We just have to get it done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once again, the Lakers had trouble with their veteran guards.  
Harper started, and had just two points and two assists in 17 
minutes. Backup Derek Fisher left for good in the second quarter 
because of tendinitis in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Kobe Bryant was contained, held to 15 points after  
scoring 17 of his 26 in the fourth quarter Monday night in a 
117-104 victory over Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, Denver isn't Utah.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our mentality is an offensive mentality,'' Harper said. ``You  
have to think defense, especially down the stretch. We didn't come 
up with any stops and as a result, we came in second. If we are 
going to be a good basketball team, we have to find a way to make 
stops.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie point guard Tyronn Lue provided a spark, getting 12  
points and six assists in only his second game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't execute on the offensive end or the defensive end,''  
said Lue, activated from the injured list Monday. ``They picked us 
apart. Our defense didn't step up and meet the challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz controlled the boards 42-36 and outscored the Lakers  
32-18 during the fourth quarter in which Los Angeles shot just 33 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why does that not surprise me? It figures,'' said Rodman, who  
had 12 rebounds. ``If you are going to commit yourself to play 
basketball, then play basketball. If you are not going to play, 
then you should sit down and don't play. Don't even bother 
coming.''

<HEADLINE> Utility Barred From Seeking Damages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge has blocked a major Midwestern  
utility from seeking potentially huge civil damages from the 
federal government for not taking its commercial nuclear reactor 
waste. 
</P>
<P>
	While the case involved only the Northern States Power Co. in  
Minnesota, government and industry representatives acknowledged 
Wednesday it could influence similar cases involving other 
utilities seeking billions of dollars from the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge John P. Wiese of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims ruled  
that Northern States should pursue its claim administratively by 
seeking an adjustment in its contract with the Energy Department, 
not through a civil suit seeking damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department has refused to transfer nearly 40,000 tons  
of reactor waste now at power plants in 34 states, although it 
agreed years ago to begin to accept such waste. The industry has 
claimed the refusal could lead to as much as $56 billion in damage 
claims as a result of civil litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wiese, in a 24-page opinion issued late Tuesday and made  
public on Wednesday, said that while the department may be 
obligated to accept the waste, any compensation for its delays 
should be pursued ``thorough the administrative remedies 
established in the standard contract'' with the Energy Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Northern States was among four utilities that sought about $4  
billion in damages from the federal government because it has 
refused to deal with the waste problem. The cases of the other 
three -- Florida Power &AMP; Light, Duke Power and Indiana-Michigan 
Power -- remain to be decided. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiese's ruling contradicts a ruling by another judge in the U.S.  
Court of Federal Claims last year involving three closed New 
England reactors. In that case the judge said the reactor owners 
could pursue a court claim, although no monetary amount was 
stipulated. The New England utilities have sought $268 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department had no comment on Wiese's decision,  
although senior department officials privately welcomed the ruling 
and were optimistic it might foreshadow similar rulings in the 
other pending cases. Dozens of utilities have been watching the 
early cases to determine whether they too should file claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``The court now has decided we are interpreting the contract and  
its provisions correctly,'' said one DOE official, speaking on 
condition he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Silberg, the attorney for Northern States Power, said no  
decision had been made on whether to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were not surprised, although disappointed. We're evaluating  
what our next step will be,'' said Silberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Government lawyers said the Northern States decision was  
significant in that it was the first one involving operating 
reactors whose owners are continuing to pay into a federal nuclear 
waste disposal fund. The New England case involved three reactors 
that were already shut down. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department had argued any claim of damages should be  
resolved by reducing payments into the federal waste fund -- an 
approach Wiese endorsed in his legal opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, another federal court ruled that the government need  
not take the waste until it has a safe place to put it, but also 
gave a green light for utilities to file claims with the court of 
claims for breach of contract. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1982, Congress assured utilities that the government would  
find a central storage site for spent reactor fuel and begin 
accepting the waste by 1998. The deadline passed, but the 
government is not expected to have a central waste storage facility 
until 2010 at the earliest.

	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- A chemical explosion rocked a laboratory  
at San Jose State University Wednesday morning, injuring six

<HEADLINE> Plastic Nixed in Making of IV Bags </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Baxter International Inc. has announced plans to  
stop making intravenous bags from polyvinyl chloride because of 
concern over exposing patients to dangerous chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement Tuesday follows the release of a study  
commissioned by several health groups that concluded the chemical 
DEHP never fully bonds with polyvinyl chloride and can leach into 
fluids in IV bags. 
</P>
<P>
	The government classifies DEHP as a probable carcinogen, based  
on studies of animals given high doses. The Food and Drug 
Administration, however, said it is unclear whether hospital 
patients are exposed to sufficient quantities of DEHP to warrant 
concern. 
</P>
<P>
	Polyvinyl chloride, or PVC, is a plastic used widely in products  
ranging from shower curtains to medical devices. Environmentalists 
dislike it because the manufacture and incineration of PVC can 
cause dioxin pollution. 
</P>
<P>
	Many IV bags are made of PVC plastic and thus contain DEHP.  
</P>
<P>
	Deerfield-based Baxter, a major producer of medical supplies,  
did not address the concerns over PVC. 
</P>
<P>
	``In instances where the overall performance and safety of  
another material is proven superior to PVC and regulatory clearance 
is obtained, Baxter will offer an alternative,'' Baxter Vice 
President Jack McGinley said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes Equal Pay for Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton renewed his call Wednesday  
for equal pay for working women, saying the country has ``the 
opportunity of a generation'' to correct the inequity during good 
economic times. 
</P>
<P>
	The president, along with first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and  
Labor Secretary Alexis Herman, played host to a roundtable 
discussion with four women who related their battles to address 
salary disputes with lawsuits as well as on-the-job diplomacy. The 
event was held to commemorate Equal Pay Day on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are still those who claim that this is a made-up  
problem, that any wage gap between men and women can be explained 
away by the choices women make,'' Mrs. Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is still a sizeable gap between men's and women's  
salaries that can best be explained by one phenomenon: the 
continuing presence and the persistent effect of discrimination, 
sometimes in very subtle ways,'' said the first lady, who practiced 
law in Arkansas while her husband pursued his public service 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton -- who counted himself among ``a small but vocal radical  
caucus'' of husbands whose wives have outearned them -- said 
Congress should take advantage of the nation's low unemployment and 
booming economy and pass the Paycheck Fairness Act introduced last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would allow women to sue their employers for  
unlimited compensatory and punitive damages, in addition to the 
limited damages and back-pay awards now available under federal law 
to remedy pay violations. That would bring women on par with other 
minorities in wage discrimination matters. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's Council of Economic Advisers reported last year  
that women earn about 75 cents for every dollar a man earns, a 
narrower gap than in 1963, when President Kennedy signed the 
original Equal Pay Act. Then, women workers earned 58 cents for 
every dollar paid to male workers. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of his fiscal 2000 budget, Clinton has requested $14  
million for efforts to close the wage gap between men and women. 
</P>
<P>
	He wants $10 million for training Equal Employment Opportunity  
Commission employees to identify and respond to wage 
discrimination, and $4 million for a Department of Labor program to 
help contractors hire and promote women in non-traditional jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sonya Tyler, women's basketball coach at Howard University, said  
the greatest degrees of bias often are found in nontraditional 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
	She filed a Title IX complaint against the school in 1991 when  
she learned that the newly hired men's basketball coach was being 
paid four times more than she, based on professional basketball 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't really look at the comparison between he and I ...  
until I was told that I had not played in the NBA,'' Tyler said. 
``I'm not building NBA players, and neither are our men. What was 
happening wasn't fair. Once fair was not going to be addressed, ... 
I took them to the institution I thought they respected most, and 
that was the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A jury awarded Tyler $2.39 million. She is still coaching at  
Howard. She said her case has improved conditions for women coaches 
elsewhere, in terms of contracts, practice hours and lower 
coach-to-athlete ratios.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Lay Out China Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji already in the  
United States for the start of a nine-day visit, President Clinton 
was laying out his administration's China policy in a speech today. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu's six-city tour, which began Tuesday in Los Angeles, comes  
at a time of particularly tense relations between Beijing and 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	China has called for an immediate halt to the NATO airstrikes  
and Chinese leaders even considered postponing Zhu's visit. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Zhu hopes to close a deal with the Clinton administration  
to allow Beijing to join the World Trade Organization, which 
regulates international trade, after 13 years of trying. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators worked furiously to try to  
strike a deal that could be announced during Zhu's visit to 
Washington on Thursday and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu also will visit Denver, Chicago, New York and Boston,  
courting the political and business elite at each stop. He may 
observe financial markets, possibly the New York Stock Exchange and 
the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	China hopes to attract the foreign investment needed to help its  
slowing economy. 
</P>
<P>
	While in Washington, Zhu was to dine with Clinton on Thursday  
evening, hold meetings with officials of the World Bank and 
International Monetary Fund and meet on Friday with a handful of 
lawmakers back early from the two-week congressional recess. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that they will understand better the importance of  
China-U.S. relations,'' said Yu Shuning, a spokesman for the 
Chinese Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
	Criticism in Congress of China's human rights record is  
bipartisan and widespread. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the tensions are concerns -- particularly among  
Republicans who see it as a good 2000 campaign issue -- over alleged 
Chinese nuclear espionage, Pentagon reports of a missile buildup 
against Taiwan and alleged Chinese campaign contributions to 
Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese, in turn, resent a U.S. initiative to provide a  
missile-defense shield for Japan and Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	China also strongly opposes U.S. sponsorship at the annual U.N.  
Human Rights Commission meeting in Geneva of a resolution 
condemning Beijing's human rights record -- a step taken by the 
administration only after extensive prodding from Congress.

<HEADLINE> Noted Jazz Musician Red Norvo Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- Red Norvo, who performed with such  
greats as Charles Mingus and Frank Sinatra and is credited with 
introducing the xylophone to jazz, has died. He was 91. 
</P>
<P>
	Norvo died Tuesday at the Fireside Convalescent Home, grandson  
Aaron Corlin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a fabulous man,'' Corlin said. ``He was always thinking  
about music, it was his life. ... His position in jazz history says 
a lot for itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born Kenneth Norville in Beardstown, Ill., he taught himself how  
to play piano and xylophone. By age 17, he was touring with a 
vaudeville show and later joined the Paul Ash Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
	His last name changed to Norvo after Ash mispronounced it to a  
reporter and Norvo's manager decided the shorter name was more 
fitting. 
</P>
<P>
	During Norvo's tenure with Paul Whiteman's Orchestra, which he  
joined in 1932, he met singer Mildred Bailey, whom he later 
married. By 1935, he formed his own sextet that played in clubs on 
New York City's 52nd Street. 
</P>
<P>
	In subsequent years, Norvo and his wife, who were known as ``Mr.  
and Mrs. Swing,'' formed several groups in New York and Chicago. 
Among their hits in the 1930s were ``Rockin' Chair,'' ``Please Be 
Kind,'' ``Says My Heart'' and ``Have You Forgotten So Soon?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1943, he switched from xylophone to vibraphone, which he  
played almost exclusively for the rest of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1945, Norvo joined the Benny Goodman orchestra, and a year  
later played with Woody Herman's orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to leading his own small groups, forming a trio in  
1950 that included Tal Farlow on guitar and Mingus on bass. He also 
toured and appeared on television with Sinatra. 
</P>
<P>
	Norvo continued to perform through the early 1990s, when he  
suffered a stroke that ended his public performances. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bailey, whose likeness was featured on a 1996 U.S. postage  
stamp, died in 1951. Norvo later married Eve Rogers, who died in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides his grandson, Norvo is survived by his daughter, Portia.  
Funeral arrangements were pending.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Chiquita Lawyer on Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A reporter who promised to protect the  
identity of a source at the Chiquita banana company is legally 
bound to keep that agreement, according to the source himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for George G. Ventura made the argument Tuesday to try  
to prevent two former reporters for The Cincinnati Enquirer from 
linking him to the illegal intrusion into Chiquita's internal 
voice-mail system. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense is trying to persuade a judge to throw out all 10  
felony charges against Ventura, a former lawyer for Chiquita Brands 
International Inc. who is now in private practice in Salt Lake 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Ann Marie Tracey didn't say when she will decide.  
</P>
<P>
	Ventura has pleaded innocent to unlawful interception of  
communications and unauthorized access to computer systems. He 
could get 12 1/2 years in prison if convicted. His trial begins July 
6. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the former Enquirer reporters identified Ventura in court  
this week as a source -- and the attorney's lawyers referred to the 
disclosure Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	They argued that a reporter who promises anonymity to a source  
has effectively entered into a legally binding contract that 
protects the source against being exposed later by the reporter, 
even under pressure of prosecution. They said Ohio's shield law, 
which allows reporters to protect the identities of confidential 
sources, also protects the sources. 
</P>
<P>
	``If one (reporter) decides he is going to become an arm of the  
prosecutor and divulge the identity of a confidential source, then 
he has done journalism a tremendous disservice, because then no 
confidential source is ever going to cooperate with a reporter 
again,'' said Marc Mezibov, a lawyer for Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Breyer, the prosecutor, said he saw no reason to legally  
protect the identity of sources. He said that could have the effect 
of releasing sources from any accountability for their actions. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters Michael Gallagher and Cameron McWhirter relied on the  
voice mail messages in an Enquirer package of stories last May 
accusing Cincinnati-based Chiquita of improper dealings in Central 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, the Enquirer fired Gallagher, apologized on its front  
page to Chiquita and said it was paying Chiquita more than $10 
million to settle any claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallagher pleaded guilty in September to felony charges and is  
awaiting sentencing that could range from 2 1/2 years in prison to 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
	McWhirter has not been charged and now works for The Detroit  
News. He has said he did not access Chiquita's system but got codes 
from a source and gave them to Gallagher.

<HEADLINE> Gambling Commission Prepares Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Members of a federal panel studying gambling  
seem largely united against ``convenience gambling'' -- via the 
Internet, or on slot machines in supermarkets -- and against slot 
machines at racetracks, bars and food stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Six members of the nine-member National Gambling Impact Study  
Commission attending a meeting here Wednesday seemed to agree on an 
overriding goal: to maintain gambling as a destination activity -- a 
reason to travel to places like Las Vegas or Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are wide divisions among commission members on the  
overall tone of the report they are drafting for Congress, the 
president, state governments and tribal governments on the economic 
and social impacts of legalized gambling. After two years of work, 
they face a June 18 deadline to submit that report. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner John Wilhelm, general president of the Hotel  
Employees and Restaurant Employees Union, said the theme should be 
informational -- what is known about the effects of gambling 
expansion and what should be monitored. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe a prohibitionist view of gambling is not going to  
work,'' Wilhelm said. ``History demonstrates that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But commissioner Richard Leone, a former state treasurer of New  
Jersey, said the report should acknowledge that the nation is ``on 
a slippery slope'' that could bring gambling outlets to every 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would not be surprised,'' Leone said, ``if a commission  
(studying gambling) in 20 years has to deal with franchise wars, 
between 'McGambling' and 'TGIGambling.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The two-day meeting that began Wednesday was billed as a session  
of the panel's three-member report subcommittee. But with the 
commission nearing its final report, six of the nine commissioners 
showed up. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioners reached some consensus regarding pari-mutuel  
betting -- betting on horse and dog racing and jai-alai -- that 
betting from home is a problem and that 21 should be the minimum 
age to wager at tracks, up from 18 in some states. 
</P>
<P>
	On state lotteries, commissioners generally agreed that states  
should spend more on addiction treatment and education programs, 
that lotteries should not branch into ``casino-type activities'' 
such as video poker, that advertising should be restrained and that 
lotteries should examine whether their marketing targets poor 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	As for casinos, commissioners voiced concern about the easy  
availability of credit and alcohol to gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's topics include Internet gambling, advertising, Indian  
gambling, compulsive gambling, gambling by minors, economic 
development and crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not making final conclusions,'' cautioned commission  
chairwoman Kay James. ``We are having a discussion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The discussion often returned to arguments over federalism --  
what power Washington should yield, and what authority states 
should retain. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilhelm said the report should make clear that federal oversight  
is limited to tribal and Internet gaming, and that states control 
lotteries and commercial casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	Also arguing against an increased role for Washington was  
William Bible, former chairman of the Nevada gaming control board, 
who said the federal government has ``absolutely abrogated (its) 
responsibility'' over Indian gaming. 
</P>
<P>
	But Leone took a more skeptical view toward states, saying they  
are predominantly concerned with blocking organized crime and 
making sure their treasuries get a fair share of gambling revenue.

<HEADLINE> Northwestern Opens Internet Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Imagine you have a rare disease and the one  
doctor who knows how to cure you is on the other side of the 
planet. 
</P>
<P>
	If this is the kind of news that might keep you from buying that  
rod and reel for next year's fishing season, take heart. On 
Tuesday, Northwestern University and several corporate partners 
launched a project that could save the life of anyone in just such 
a spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Located on Northwestern's Evanston campus, the International  
Center for Advanced Internet Research will be the receiving point 
for computer-based research going on all over the world. The 
center, which participants call the first of its kind, cost $10 
million to open and will be manned by about two dozen people, 
including IBM engineers, Northwestern researchers and students. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is very interesting cutting-edge work taking place all  
over the world,'' said Andy Schmidt, a senior product manager with 
Ameritech, which is providing equipment and services to the center. 
``What Northwestern has done is create an institute that focuses 
this work and provides resources to collaborate on all sorts of 
projects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the center ``will accelerate the pace with which  
advanced Internet applications are brought to market,'' said the 
center's director, Joel Mambretti. 
</P>
<P>
	One field that Northwestern and its corporate partners hope to  
affect dramatically is medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have a rare kind of cancer and the expert is in  
Shanghai, it's not going to do you a lot of good if he can't view 
X-rays, mammograms and so forth in real time,'' said Tim Blair, an 
IBM spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the center, participants hope, physicians would be able  
to transmit images via the Internet instantaneously that today 
might take several hours to process. A high-speed network available 
to all those working on a specific case would transform the 
practice of medicine, Schmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Such high-speed networks already exist, but the center will  
allow researchers from all over the world to tap into them and 
collaborate on projects in telecommunications, health care, 
education, financial services, manufacturing and more, Blair said. 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, researchers from Northwestern and Allied Signal are  
using such a network to collaborate on the design and development 
of new airline braking systems, said Susan Andrews, a Northwestern 
spokeswoman.

	Cypriot Hopes To Free US Servicemen  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. officials indicated that NATO bombing of  
Belgrade would cease long enough tomorrow to allow a Cypriot leader 
to fly in with the hope of bringing back the three U.S. soldiers 
held by Yugoslavia. Earlier, a pentagon spokesman said NATO would 
not stop its current operations because of the effort by Cypriot 
parliament leader Spyros Kyprianou to gain the release of the 
servicemen. But he said, ``We have total control of the operations 
and certainly if it's necessary to have an aircraft fly into an 
area or out of an area at any time, that could be arranged.''

explanation, forcing tens of thousands of people back toward the 
burned villages they had been escaping. More than 400,000 refugees 
have already been forced to flee to neighboring countries. 
Meanwhile, NATO intensified its airstrikes, announcing the ``first 
major breakthrough against armored forces in the field'' in 
Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Virtual Life: Jack Nicklaus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With the latest Jack Nicklaus signature computer  
golf game, the Golden Bear knocks it stiff. 
</P>
<P>
	After years spent trailing its golf simulator nemesis ``Links,''  
which stars perennial Nicklaus rival Arnold Palmer, ``Jack Nicklaus 
Presents: Golden Bear Challenge'' is finally competing for a top 
spot on the leaderboard. 
</P>
<P>
	It is no small feat. Going after ``Links'' means taking the  
computer golf sim to a new level. 
</P>
<P>
	``Golden Bear,'' the sixth Nicklaus digital golf game, makes its  
move by vastly improving player graphics, the addition of 
customizing features that accent individual skills and spicing up 
the somewhat stagnant genre with irreverent commentary from 
wisecracking TV golf analyst Gary McCord. 
</P>
<P>
	There are new shot options, enhanced virtual golf ball physics  
and an unobtrusive yet handy interface that combine to bring added 
realism and ease of play to computer golf. 
</P>
<P>
	In perhaps the game's most significant new feature, players can  
assign skill points to various aspects of golf play: power, 
accuracy, the short game shots, sand play and putting. The number 
of skill points available to a player depends on the difficulty 
level he or she chooses. 
</P>
<P>
	Players can step into Nicklaus' shoes and play as the living  
legend, or they can play against him. There are also several other 
player animations to choose from, allowing players to choose a 
gender, body type and ethnicity. 
</P>
<P>
	Graphics quality stands out as another major improvement,  
including superb shimmering water hazards and flocks of birds 
flying out of trees hit by stray shots. It's all achieved through 
software, so having one of the latest 3-D video accelerators isn't 
required. 
</P>
<P>
	Game play can be viewed through a wide array of cameras,  
mimicking the many perspectives offered by televised golf coverage. 
Picture-in-picture setups can be modified at will, creating 
interesting possibilities like joining close-up and overhead views. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet play is supported, so people can arrange matches on the  
World Wide Web and compete via modem. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broadcast booth with McCord, the colorful former pro with  
a handlebar mustache, is stalwart CBS colleague Jim Nantz. Both 
evaluate play during games. 
</P>
<P>
	McCord, the teacher chosen to prepare Kevin Costner for his role  
in ``Tin Cup,'' isn't all fun and games, though. Good shots bring 
comments like telling players their ``swing should be hung in The 
Louvre,'' while bad shots bring remarks like ``call the coroner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The game features only courses designed by Nicklaus, whose  
renowned course architecture skills, on display all over the world, 
rival his playing prowess. The five offerings include Muirfield 
Village, site of the annual Memorial Golf Tournament, Shoal Creek, 
which was host to the PGA Championship in 1990, and the Cochise 
Course at Desert Mountain, home of The Tradition, a senior tour 
major tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Rounding out the offerings are Sherwood Country Club, site of  
the annual Greg Norman Shark Shootout, Sherry Montecastillo in 
Spain, where the Volvo Masters is played, and Nicklaus North in 
Whistler, British Columbia, site of the 1997 Canadian Skins Game. 
</P>
<P>
	Like previous Nicklaus games, the new version has a built-in  
course designer, a unique feature giving players the chance to 
create their own playable cyberspace layouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite relatively minor problems like somewhat slow graphics  
loading and often misleading putting information on the greens, 
Nicklaus wins this round, just as the Golden Bear did many times 
during his long rivalry with Palmer. Other digital golf contenders, 
including the highly touted ``Tiger Woods '99,'' don't even come 
close. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jack Nicklaus Presents: Golden Bear Challenge'' (Activision,  
CD-ROM for Windows95-98, $49.95) is as gifted as its namesake, 
pushing the envelope in an overcrowded sports software genre by 
taking dead aim and refusing to leave anything in the bag.

<HEADLINE> EU To Comply With WTO Banana Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Union said Wednesday it  
will abide by the decision of the World Trade Organization 
supporting U.S. claims that EU banana import rules violate WTO 
regulations. . 
</P>
<P>
	The WTO on Tuesday authorized the United States to impose $191  
million in 100 percent tariffs on European goods -- anything from 
sweaters to handbags and coffee makers. 
</P>
<P>
	The amount of tariffs authorized was one-third of the U.S.  
demand of $520 million. The United States will be able to choose 
from a list of products which will get the tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Leon Brittan, trade commissioner for the EU's executive body,  
continued to criticize the U.S. tariffs Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, ``we will naturally abide by the rules applicable  
in the case of such decisions, as we have consistently said we 
would,'' Brittan said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	During the six-year battle, the United States has contended that  
EU rules unfairly discriminate against bananas grown by Chiquita 
Brands International Inc. and Dole Food Co. in order to favor 
bananas grown by former European colonies in Africa and in the 
Caribbean. The American companies have plantations in Latin 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials said the smaller amount of tariffs authorized by  
the WTO still represents the largest amount of trade sanctions it 
has ever authorized. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States will decide on the final list of targeted  
products in a few days, U.S. officials said. They will be selected 
from the original target list, which covered products ranging from 
Scottish cashmere sweaters and Italian cheese to French handbags 
and German coffee makers. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to the WTO decision the U.S. had attempted to impose the  
full $520 million in sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States ``must now in any event immediately end  
sanctions and the threat of sanctions on over half the trade 
currently subject to them,'' said Brittan, the EU's acting trade 
commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
	Brittan's spokesman, Simon Fraser, told reporters that after  
reading the complicated 150-page WTO report, the Commission would 
consult with the 15 EU members before deciding whether to appeal. 
He added, though, that the trade bloc had ``no intention of 
dragging this out.''

<HEADLINE> Pettitte Scratched From Spring Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- New York Yankees left-hander Andy  
Pettitte was scratched from an extended spring training start 
Wednesday because of a sprained ankle, and is not expected to pitch 
for at least another 3-5 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Pettitte, on the 15-day disabled list with a stiff left elbow,  
sprained his right ankle Tuesday while doing agility drills at the 
Yankees' spring training complex in Tampa, Fla. X-rays were 
negative, but the sore ankle forced him to skip Wednesday's start. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees had hoped Pettitte would be ready to return for an  
April 17 game against Detroit, but that plan now looks less likely.

<HEADLINE> Starr To Testify at Senate Panel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and the  
three-judge panel that appointed him will testify April 14 before a 
Senate committee considering whether Congress should renew the 
Watergate-inspired law that provided for his job. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, chaired by Sen. Fred  
Thompson, R-Tenn., will hear from Starr and federal judges Richard 
D. Cudahy, Peter T. Fay and David B. Sentelle, the panel announced 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In his own statement, Starr confirmed that he would testify and  
said he looked forward to it. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson has pledged to keep the hearings from focusing on  
Starr's controversial, five-year investigation of President 
Clinton, which led to only the second presidential impeachment in 
history. The Senate acquitted Clinton on Feb. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Thompson has called former independent counsels and  
scholars to three hearings on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is Starr's efforts that brought Democrats into line with  
Republicans long infuriated with loopholes in the 1978 statute and 
built momentum for letting the law expire June 30 or renewing it 
only with a major overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the statute's weaknesses, critics say, is that it doesn't  
hold independent counsels accountable for the money they spend or 
the tactics they use. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, critics contend the three-judge Special Division of  
the Court of Appeals, which hires independent counsels, is 
ill-equipped to make such appointments. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence Walsh, the independent counsel who's Iran-Contra probe  
of President Reagan soured Republicans on the law, told Thompson's 
panel last month that a special agency within the Justice 
Department, not a three-judge panel, should appoint independent 
counsels. The members of that panel should be subject to 
confirmation by the Senate, Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the Independent Counsel law, such probes would revert to  
the Justice Department -- which is how they were handled until the 
``Saturday Night Massacre'' in October 1973, when the department's 
top two officials lost their jobs for refusing to carry out 
President Nixon's order to fire special prosecutor Archibald Cox. 
Attorney General Elliot Richardson quit and Deputy Attorney General 
William Ruckelshaus was fired. Solicitor General Robert Bork fired 
Cox. 
</P>
<P>
	Several committee members predict that no Justice Department  
probe, headed by a politically appointed attorney general, would 
carry credibility with the public.

<HEADLINE> US To Impose Tariffs in Banana Spat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States has been given the go-ahead  
to impose penalty tariffs on $191.4 million worth of European 
imports annually, getting to choose from a list that includes 
Scottish cashmere sweaters, fancy French handbags and German coffee 
makers. 
</P>
<P>
	The 100 percent tariffs, which are designed to eliminate the  
targeted products from U.S. stores, were awarded by the World Trade 
Organization on Tuesday as a fallout from a nasty trade war between 
the United States and Europe over bananas. 
</P>
<P>
	The WTO ruled that U.S. banana companies were suffering $191.4  
million in lost sales annually because of unfair European 
restrictions that favor bananas grown in former European colonies 
in the Caribbean and Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	While this represented a reduction of nearly two-thirds from the  
original U.S. damage claim of $520 million, the Clinton 
administration said the smaller figure was still the largest damage 
award ever approved by the WTO, the Geneva-based organization that 
sets the rules for world trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``This decision is an important victory for the WTO dispute  
settlement process and sends a clear message that the WTO cannot be 
used to engage in endless litigation,'' U.S. Trade Representative 
Charlene Barshefsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the final list of targeted products would be selected  
from the original target list and would be published within the 
next few days in the Federal Register. 
</P>
<P>
	EU officials have charged political motivations were behind the  
U.S. determination to start a trade war over a product that 
accounts for a minuscule amount of trade between the world's two 
biggest trading partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Two American companies, Chiquita Brands International and Dole  
Food Co., grow their bananas on plantations in South America. Carl 
Lindner, the head of Chiquita, has been a major campaign 
contributor to both Democrats and Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Clinton administration insisted that it has been  
fighting to uphold the principal that countries that lose cases 
before the WTO must either eliminate their unfair barriers or face 
economic penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Scher, America's top negotiator on agriculture matters,  
said the United States had prevailed on every major point in 
contention. EU officials said late Tuesday they were still studying 
the 150-plus-page WTO ruling and would have no immediate comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States began requiring importers to post 100 percent  
bonds on March 3 on the larger $520 million list of products but 
said it would reduce the ultimate penalties once the WTO ruled on 
the appropriate level of damages. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, EU Trade minister Leon Brittan charged that the  
United States was acting in an ``unacceptable and unlawful'' manner 
in requiring importers to post bonds before the WTO arbitration 
decision was made. 
</P>
<P>
	Scher said the banana ruling set an important precedent for a  
second trade fight the United States is waging with Europe over its 
ban on American beef containing growth hormones. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has published a separate list  
covering more than $900 million in imports and will hold a hearing 
on April 21 to receive public comments on what products should be 
targeted in the beef dispute. American cattle producers contend 
they are losing $500 million annually because of the hormone ban. 
</P>
<P>
	The original $520 million sanction list in the banana fight  
covered Louis Vitton handbags from France, sweet biscuits from 
Britain, Parma ham and pecorino cheese from Italy, German coffee 
makers and less fancy imports ranging from plastic packaging 
material to electric batteries. 
</P>
<P>
	The $900 million preliminary target list in the beef dispute  
included truffles and foie gras, Evian and Perrier mineral waters, 
Danish ham and Belgian chocolates.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks rose moderately Thursday morning as  
the market was supported by more foreign buying. The dollar was 
higher against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average gained 78.47 points, or 0.47 percent,  
to 16,632.97 points at the end of the morning session. On 
Wednesday, the average closed up 74.79 points, or 0.45 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.16 yen in late morning, up 0.38 yen from  
late Wednesday in Tokyo but below its level of 121.35 in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices started lower on profit-taking  
following recent gains, but buying of steel and communications 
issues reversed the course. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Thursday's session, the Nikkei index had gained a total  
of 264.31 points in the three previous trading days, mostly on 
buying from foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the market was also buoyed by a surge in New York,  
where the Dow Jones industrial average rose 121.82 points to close 
at 10,085.31. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the Dow's third close above 10,000 points and eclipsed  
the previous high of 10,007.33 hit Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 3.26 points, or 0.25 percent, to 1,327.90. The 
TOPIX closed up 2.03 points, or 0.15 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar was slightly higher on bids by  
Japanese trust banks and investment trust management firms, traders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	They added, however, that the U.S. currency remained somewhat  
top-heavy on selling offers from Japanese exporters. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 130.66 yen, up from  
130.20 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond dropped to  
1.640 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.685 percent, pushing its 
price up to 101.39 yen from 100.99 yen.

<HEADLINE> Jockey Julie Krone Set To Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Julie Krone, thoroughbred racing's most  
successful female jockey, is expected to announce her retirement on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Krone, who has won more than 3,500 races and is the only female  
rider to win a Triple Crown race, called a news conference for 
Thursday at Aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's retiring,'' Joey DiAngelo, Krone's agent, said  
Wednesday. ``It's time for her to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krone, 35, who just completed riding at the Fair Grounds in New  
Orleans, wasn't immediately available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``She'll explain it all at the news conference,'' DiAngelo said.  
</P>
<P>
	For years, Krone has been one of racing's most recognizable  
figures. Her distinctive squeaky-pitched voice belied a fearless 
approach to riding, which helped her win meet titles at some of the 
nation's toughest race tracks. However, her career was plagued by 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Last November, Krone broke her right knee at the Meadowlands.  
She won the race in which she was injured and then added two more 
winners before the fracture was diagnosed the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	Krone was back racing three months later and on Feb. 16, she  
posted her 3,500th victory, guiding May B A Walk to a win at the 
Fair Grounds. She was the first female jockey to reach that 
milestone and celebrated with a backward handspring. 
</P>
<P>
	DiAngelo said Krone would honor her riding commitments through  
April 18. He added that Krone would ride in the Kentucky Derby on 
May 1 if Desert Demon, a long shot prospect at best, is entered in 
the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Krone began her impressive run of success in 1987, five years  
after winning her first riding title at Atlantic City. Krone became 
the first female to win riding titles at major tracks such as 
Monmouth Park and the Meadowlands in New Jersey. In 1992 and 1993, 
Krone won riding titles at Gulfstream Park, one of the premier 
meets in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	In June 1993, she guided Colonial Affair to victory in the  
Belmont for trainer Scotty Schulhofer. It was the high point of her 
career. Just months later, at Saratoga, her career took a terrible 
turn. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 30, she went down in a spill and severely fractured her  
right ankle, which required two plates and 14 screws to 
reconstruct. Nine months later, she was riding again. Then on Jan. 
13, 1995, she was thrown from her horse again, this time at 
Gulfstream. She broke both hands. 
</P>
<P>
	When she was ready to come back, there was talk she had lost her  
nerve, and trainers who used to hire her without hesitation were 
suddenly gone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can you imagine what it's like to feel every time you go out  
that you're going to die?'' Krone told The New York Daily News in a 
recent article. 
</P>
<P>
	Krone had one other serious spill, at the Meadowlands in  
November 1989. She fractured her left arm, which required a plate 
and seven screws to repair. 
</P>
<P>
	Krone, 4-foot-10 1/2 and 100 pounds, became the winningest female  
jockey on March 6, 1988, when she won aboard the filly Squawter at 
Aqueduct -- win No. 1,205. 
</P>
<P>
	Krone's career purse earnings are now close to $80 million, more  
than four times the total of No. 2 female jockey Donna Barton. 
Krone was the top-earning female rider from 1986-96 with a career 
high of $9.1 million in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Krone is one of only three riders to win five races in a day at  
Saratoga, pulling off the feat on Aug. 20, 1993. Angel Cordero Jr. 
and Ron Turcotte were the others. 
</P>
<P>
	Krone, married since 1995 to Matt Muzikar, won her first race  
with Lord Farkle at Tampa Bay Downs on Feb. 12, 1981.

</P>
<P>
	CLAREMONT, N.H. (AP) -- Frederick W. Carr, a World War II pilot  
and prisoner of war, died Monday at age 77. 
</P>
<P>
	Carr enlisted in the Army Air Corps when he turned 21 and then  
joined the 8th Army Air Force, 489th Bomber Group and the 846th 
Squadron, flying out of England. 
</P>
<P>
	On June 25, 1944, while flying his 18th mission, Carr was shot  
down near Gisors, France. He survived, and the French Underground 
hid him in Etrepagney, providing him with false identity papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Carr worked for a time in the laboratory of E.J. Hugel, mayor of  
Etrepagney and a leader in the underground. But during an attempt 
to escape occupied territory and rejoin the Allied Forces, he was 
captured by the Gestapo. 
</P>
<P>
	He was incarcerated in Fresnes Prison in Paris, then sent to the  
Buchenwald concentration camp in Germany. After four months, he was 
transferred to a prisoner of war camp in Poland, Stalag Luft III. 
</P>
<P>
	With other prisoners, he walked 500 miles to Munich to be  
liberated by U.S. Gen. George Patton on April 27, 1945. He later 
testified at the Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	Carr, who left the Air Force with the rank of captain, later  
became a high school principal.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Michael Manuel, a director and writer who worked  
with the Metropolitan Opera for a decade, died Monday of lung 
cancer. He was 70. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in London, Manuel briefly attended the Royal Academy of  
Music in 1928. Twenty years later he joined the Royal Opera 
company, Covent Garden, as an assistant stage manager. Within three 
years he was stage manager for the Royal Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined the Met in 1957 as executive stage manager, and  
directed Gluck's ``Orfeo and Eurydice'' and ``Alcestis,'' and 
Strauss' ``Elektra.'' In 1964 Manuel was appointed co-general 
manager of the Metropolitan Opera National Company, which played 
240 performances in 72 cities in its first season. 
</P>
<P>
	Manuel left the Met after the company's dissolution following

	BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) -- Robert B. Miller Sr., who served as  
publisher of the Battle Creek Enquirer and News for 27 years, died 
Tuesday at age 92. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller was in the newspaper business for 50 years and also was a  
philanthropist and major investor in rebuilding downtown Battle 
Creek. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller's father, Albert Miller, became editor and publisher of  
C.W. Post's Morning Enquirer, one of three newspapers in the city 
in 1910. In 1918, Albert Miller merged the Morning Enquirer and the 
Evening News into the Battle Creek Enquirer and News. 
</P>
<P>
	His son became a reporter for the Battle Creek Enquirer and News

third generation of Millers to run the newspaper. He served as 
publisher until 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper, now called the Battle Creek Enquirer, changed its  
name in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years the family acquired six other newspapers, forming  
Federated Publications. Federated was purchased by Gannett Co. Inc. 
in 1971.

</P>
<P>
	SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- Red Norvo, who performed with such  
greats as Charles Mingus and Frank Sinatra and is credited with 
introducing the xylophone to jazz, died Tuesday at age 91. 
</P>
<P>
	He taught himself how to play piano and xylophone. By age 17, he  
was touring with a vaudeville show and later joined the Paul Ash 
Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
	Born Kenneth Norville, his last name changed to Norvo after Ash  
mispronounced it to a reporter and his manager decided the shorter 
name was more fitting. 
</P>
<P>
	During Norvo's tenure with Paul Whiteman's Orchestra, which he  
joined in 1932, he met singer Mildred Bailey, whom he later 
married. By 1935, he formed his own sextet that played in clubs on 
New York City's 52nd Street. 
</P>
<P>
	In subsequent years, Norvo and his wife, who were known as ``Mr.  
and Mrs. Swing,'' formed several groups in New York and Chicago. 
Among their hits in the 1930s were ``Rockin' Chair,'' ``Please Be 
Kind,'' ``Says My Heart'' and ``Have You Forgotten So Soon?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1943, he switched from xylophone to vibraphone, which he  
played almost exclusively for the rest of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Norvo continued to perform until he suffered a stroke in the  
early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bailey, whose likeness was featured on a 1996 U.S. postage  
stamp, died in 1951. Norvo later married Eve Rogers, who died in 
1992.

cultural groups and liberal political causes, died Friday on her 
84th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with her late brother, Mrs. Russell co-founded the  
Columbia Foundation, which distributed grants totaling about $3.5 
million in the last fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	One of her earliest grants after World War II went to the  
Emergency Committee of Atomic Scientists to help discourage the 
further use of nuclear weapons and energy. She later was active in 
causes that included the abolition of the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	She was a major contributor to Democratic candidates and the  
Democratic Party, supporting U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, President 
Clinton, Rep. Nancy Pelosi and many others. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Russell also was a prominent supporter of the arts. Her  
foundation recently made large donations to the San Francisco 
Opera, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the Asian Art 
Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	The current home of KQED, San Francisco's public TV and radio  
station, bears her name. 
</P>
<P>
	She was a great-grandniece of the Bavarian immigrant who crafted  
the first pair of blue jeans.

<HEADLINE> China Dissident Kept From Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- An exiled Chinese dissident was  
prevented from flying to Hong Kong on Wednesday, two days after 
China refused him permission to travel to Beijing on a flight from 
South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Wang Xizhe has sought to return to China to pay his respects at  
the grave of his father and simultaneously test Beijing's policy of 
barring unwanted exiles and politically active foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
	Rebuffed, Wang left Bangkok Wednesday night on a flight bound  
for the United States via Seoul, South Korea, said a friend who saw 
him off at the airport, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Wang, a veteran dissident active for 25 years, said the apparent  
refusal of Hong Kong authorities to allow him entry proved that 
China was exercising undue influence over the former British colony 
it regained control of in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very angry,'' Wang told reporters. ``They say it's one  
nation, two systems, but first the Chinese government does not 
allow me to go, and now the Hong Kong government. How can this 
be?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wang, who has spent years in prison, sneaked out of China three  
years ago to evade arrest and carries no passport, only a ``refugee 
travel document'' issued by the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the 50-year-old Wang got as far as Seoul on an Asiana  
flight from New York before he was informed that China would not 
let him fly to Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	He then headed to Bangkok, accepting conditions set by Thai  
officials that he would not engage in anti-China protests. 
</P>
<P>
	Wang booked himself on a Thai Airways flight Wednesday to Hong  
Kong but was not allowed to check in when he arrived at Bangkok's 
international airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Thai Airways staff told Wang he did not have the required  
transit visa to stay in Hong Kong. As he was arguing his case, a 
telex arrived from the airline's Hong Kong office saying that 
authorities had no intention of offending China by allowing him 
entry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really want to leave,'' Wang said.  
</P>
<P>
	Although Asiana's flights to Seoul and New York were packed,  
space was made to get Wang out of Bangkok. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement by the Hong Kong government denied that its  
officials ``had been in touch with Thai authorities over the entry 
or transit of Mr. Wang in Hong Kong.'' But it did not say whether 
it had contacted airline officials. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the Supreme People's Court in China on Tuesday  
Wang said that barring him contradicted government claims to be 
building a society based on a clear system of laws.

<HEADLINE> Yahoo! Reports $16M Quarter Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Yahoo! Inc.'s first-quarter earnings easily  
surpassed analysts' expectations, helped by a surge of Web visitors 
and new deals with online businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! earned $16 million, or 7 cents a share, in the three  
months ended March 31. That was up from a profit of $3.3 million, 
or 2 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Excluding one-time 
charges, the Santa Clara, Calif-.based company would have earned 
$25.1 million, or 11 cents a share, in the recent quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call had predicted earnings of 8  
cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterly revenues nearly tripled to $86.1 million from $30.6  
million as the number of visitors to its Web sites grew 5.4 percent 
in February alone. Yahoo! struck numerous new deals with online 
businesses, including retailers who paid for links on Yahoo!'s Web 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo!, one of the few Internet companies that actually makes  
money, said it is well positioned for further growth with its 
recent purchase of broadcast.com, the top provider of TV and radio 
programming on the Web, and its purchase of GeoCities, which hosts 
Web pages created by individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect both of these acquisitions, which are not reflected  
in our first quarter results, to add substantially to the breadth 
of services we offer our global users, and advertising, merchant 
and business partners,'' said Yahoo! chief executive Tim Koogle. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Balderston, an industry analyst with Redwood City-based Zona  
Research, said that big Internet companies like Yahoo! -- which has 
a market value of nearly $42 billion -- will have to begin 
generating bigger revenue if they are to maintain an investor 
enthusiasm that's pushed the Dow over 10,000 and made such 
businesses worth much more than they are actually producing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now Yahoo! and a lot of the Internet stocks still enjoy  
valuation based on infinite possibilities,'' Balderston said. ``At 
some point those are going to have to become probabilities and 
plausibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo!, the second most popular Internet destination, has sites  
with a range of features from chat rooms to news and search 
services. It announced a deal Monday to deliver its content and 
services to hand-held computers and devices for viewing the Web on 
TV. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal with Online Anywhere, Yahoo! will provide e-mail,  
personal calendars, weather and stock quotes. Online Anywhere's 
technology automatically formats the information to fit whatever 
device the subscriber is using, be it a large-screen television or 
a pocket-size, hand-held computer.

<TEXT>
<P>
 *Celebrity Spotlight &AMP; Birthdays    	
</P>
<P>
	In the spotlight: Andy Garcia  
</P>
<P>
	 *Personal stats:* Andy Garcia was born April 12, 1956, in  
Havana, Cuba. His father was a prominent lawyer and his mother 
taught English. The family left Cuba when he was 5 and settled in 
Miami Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia liked movies as a child but felt no special desire to act  
until he went to Florida International University. After college, 
he moved to Los Angeles, hoping to break into movies. First came a 
spot in the TV pilot for ``Hill Street Blues.'' Theater work 
followed, with appearances in ``Anastasia,'' ``The Cherry 
Orchard,'' ``Don't Trust Life'' and other works. 
</P>
<P>
	Movies began in 1983 with ``Blue Skies Again'' and ``A Night in  
Heaven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agents wanted him to abandon his Latin roots.  
</P>
<P>
	``Change my name, yeah, that was an immediate suggestion by  
early agents I was attempting to get,'' he said. ``They said 
`change your name, fix your nose, cut your hair, lift some weights' 
-- stuff like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia refused.  
</P>
<P>
	 *Breakthrough:* Garcia hit the big time playing sidekick to  
mob-busters Kevin Costner and Sean Connery in ``The Untouchables'' 
(1987) and then three years later in Francis Ford Coppola's ``The 
Godfather: Part III.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia became a top draw. He was often cast either as a cop or  
as a hood. 
</P>
<P>
	He and Meg Ryan were co-stars in ``When a Man Loves a Woman.''  
He then worked in quirkier films like ``Things to Do in Denver When 
You're Dead'' and ``The Disappearance of Garcia Lorca,'' about the 
famed Spanish poet. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, Garcia stars opposite Andie MacDowell in ``Just the  
Ticket.'' Garcia was a producer for the movie, which was 10 years 
in the making, and also wrote songs for the film's Latin-influenced 
soundtrack. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Quote:* ``There's nothing that I cherish more than my culture  
and what I am. But to call me the great Hispanic actor is 
ridiculous; it's racism. They don't call Dustin Hoffman the great 
Jewish-American actor.''

<HEADLINE> At Home To Expand Into Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDWOOD CITY, Calif. (AP) -- At Home Corp. announced today that  
it will form a joint venture to bring its high-speed cable 
Internet-access service to 5 million homes in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The venture, called At Home Japan, will also be partly owned by  
Japanese cable operator Jupiter Telecommunications and one of that 
company's owners, trading giant Sumitomo Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``With roughly 15 million Internet users, Japan is an extremely  
promising market for high-speed cable Internet services and a 
tremendous next step in At Home's international expansion,'' John 
O'Farrell, senior vice president of international operations for At 
Home, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	At Home will own 43 percent of the venture, Jupiter  
Telecommunications will hold 36 percent and Sumitomo will own a 21 
percent stake, O'Farrell said. 
</P>
<P>
	At Home now has about 330,000 customers in the United States and  
Canada who use its high-speed Internet access. But it has 
partnerships with 21 cable operators that give it exclusive access 
to sell to about 60 million homes. Analysts expect At Home to have 
1 million subscribers by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	At Home plans to launch a service in the Netherlands this fall  
aimed at 1.4 million users. That venture is co-owned by At Home, 
Dutch cable operators and Intel Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	About 11 percent of Japanese households had access to the  
Internet at the end of March, nearly double the amount of a year 
ago, according to Japan's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
	Jupiter Telecommunications, founded in 1995, is a joint venture  
between Sumitomo and Liberty Media International Inc. Liberty is 
part of a spinoff of Tele-Communications Inc., which was recently 
purchased by AT&AMP;T Corp. AT&AMP;T holds a controlling stake in At Home. 
</P>
<P>
	Jupiter Telecommunications provides cable TV to 348,000 homes in  
Japan. Its franchise, including Sumitomo's cable systems, covers 
5.1 million homes in 29 cable systems.

<HEADLINE> Some in Oregon Scapegoat California </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Listeners jammed the radio station  
switchboard to complain about ``them'' and their funny-talking, 
bad-driving ways. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're glad you like Oregon. Now pack up and get out!'' one  
caller fumed. 
</P>
<P>
	This wasn't some fringe forum for supremacists. It was KOTK-AM  
Hot Talk in Portland, and the Oregonians calling in were griping 
about their favorite target: Californians. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the much-maligned migration from the Golden State to  
its rainy neighbor to the north has slowed by the thousands from 
its peak in the early 1990s, an anti-California undercurrent 
courses through Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	As the state struggles to absorb an estimated 1 million more  
residents over the next 20 years, there's a new effort under way to 
revive the ``stay-out'' sentiment made famous in 1971 by then-Gov. 
Tom McCall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Come and visit us again and again,'' McCall said at the time.  
``But for heaven's sake, don't come here to live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, state Sen. John Lim, himself an immigrant from Korea,  
introduced a bill to erect signs at the state line telling 
motorists: ``You are welcome to visit Oregon, but please don't 
stay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lim said the bill is a first step toward preserving Oregon's  
livability, which he believes is threatened by growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Californians represent about a third of new residents, though  
the numbers have been steadily dropping as that state's economy has 
improved. Using driver's licenses as a rough indicator, the net 
migration from California to Oregon is half of what it was: 23,000 
in 1993 vs. 11,000 in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet most of the growth-related blame remains focused on the  
Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of a scapegoating thing,'' said John Findlay, a  
University of Washington history professor. ``It's these outsiders 
coming in, especially Californians, that are forcing up home 
prices, clogging freeways and bringing gangs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Findlay teaches a course in Northwest history. Over the past 10  
years, when he has asked his students for words associated with 
California, they've consistently come up with: bad drivers, 
pollution, overcrowded, pushy, vain, rude, disrespectful and 
superficial. 
</P>
<P>
	``Californians learn pretty quickly when they get here to change  
their plates and take off their UCLA sweatshirt,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Judy Combs said she became well aware of how native Oregonians  
felt after she moved to Lake Oswego from San Jose, Calif., in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was just this attitude,'' she said. ``We were very  
cautious about who we would tell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She quickly changed license plates and anxiously awaited her new  
driver's license in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just hated to go into a grocery store and have to drag out  
your California license,'' Ms. Combs said. ``You could just see 
them thinking, `Oh no, not another California transplant.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Even those from other places quickly learn the value of  
disassociation. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I need to say is `I'm not from California' and no one  
gives me any trouble,'' said Allana Morgan, a waitress who moved to 
Oregon 5 1/2 years ago from Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Rick Emerson, who as host of the KOTK show hears his share  
of outrageous things, said he was taken aback by Oregonians' 
dislike of Californians. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't expect it to be quite so vitriolic,'' he said. ``I've  
lived in a lot of places and they all have a feeling of propriety 
over their state. But I have never seen such a rabid fear. It 
almost causes them physical pain to see these Californians coming 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. John Kitzhaber himself repeatedly cites Southern California  
as an example of what Oregon doesn't want to become. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the issue of growth management, we've done it right,'' said  
Kitzhaber's spokesman Bob Applegate. ``If that means pointing out 
that our neighbors to the south have not done it right, then our 
apologies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, the governor believes that growth and prosperity go  
hand in hand and has nothing against Californians who choose to 
move here, Applegate said: ``They came to the right state.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Closes at New High: 10,085.31 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average soared in the  
last hour of trading today and hit a new record high as investors, 
nervous about upcoming earnings reports, sought the relative safety 
of blue-chip stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was up 121.82 at 10,085.31. It was the Dow's third close 
above 10,000, and eclipsed the previous high close of 10,007.33, 
reached Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed, reflecting the fact that  
investors are for the time being turning away from unpredictable 
technology stocks and moving their money to blue-chips that are 
seen as surer bets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite index, heavily weighted in technology  
issues, fell 18.81 to 2,544.36, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index 
rose 8.86 to 1,326.75. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks opened strongly as aluminum maker Alcoa released  
first-quarter earnings that soundly beat analysts' expectations. 
The good news from Alcoa, a component of the Dow, helped many 
blue-chips move higher. Alcoa itself was up 2 13/16 to 43 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T, another Dow stock, was up 4 13/16 at 84 15/16.  
</P>
<P>
	The financial sector was mostly higher as analysts said banks  
and brokerages have hinted they will report strong earnings when 
they begin releasing first-quarter results next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Ned Riley, chief investment officer at BankBoston, said  
investors may be rewarding those companies for weathering the 
global financial crises of 1998. The financial companies are also 
benefiting from stable interest rates, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chase Manhattan rose 5 1/8 to 84 3/8, and Merrill Lynch rose 5 1/8 to  
96 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong sales report from Ford Motor sent its shares up 2 1/2 to  
60 3/4. The automaker said in its report Tuesday it plans to increase 
production in the coming months. The news enticed investors with 
hints of future strength. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip stocks easily outperformed technology stocks  
today. Computer companies held the market in check for much the 
afternoon after Merrill Lynch analysts warned of some tough times 
ahead for the high-tech sector. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem, according to William Meehan, chief market analyst  
at Cantor Fitzgerald, is that stocks are too overvalued to 
withstand even the slightest hint of caution. ``It doesn't take 
much to trigger any kind of stampede,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Software maker Novell slipped 1 1/8 to 22 15/16, and Sun  
Microsystems fell 1 7/8 to 138 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, traders were optimistically looking ahead to an  
after-hours earnings release from Yahoo!, which was expected to 
beat analyst estimates -- and did so, by three cents a share. Yahoo! 
ended lower in profit-taking after rising more than 16 points 
earlier in the day.

<HEADLINE> Know Tax Rules in Picking Insurance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Choosing a private long-term care insurance policy  
can be a difficult task. One of the most confusing areas for buyers 
concerns the differences between policies that qualify for tax 
breaks (called ``qualified'') and those that don't (or 
``nonqualified''). 
</P>
<P>
	``There are advantages and disadvantages to each that buyers  
should know about, though I think people usually are better off 
buying a tax-qualified policy,'' says Sam Van Why, an academic 
associate at the College for Financial Planning. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax issues involve two areas: deduction of premiums paid to  
buy a long-term care policy, and the benefits you receive if you 
use the policy to pay for a stay in a nursing home, other long-term 
care facility, or at-home care. 
</P>
<P>
	Premiums you pay for a long-term care policy are tax deductible  
if they meet one of two standards: The premiums are for a policy 
you bought before Jan. 1, 1997, or in the case of a policy bought 
after that date it meets the federal criteria for a tax-qualified 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The amount of premiums you can deduct depend on your age and are  
indexed for inflation. For tax year 1999, the deductible amounts 
are up slightly in some cases from 1998. At age 40 or less, you can 
deduct $210; from age 41-50, $400; from age 51-60, $790; age 61-70, 
$2,120; age 71 and older, $2,660. 
</P>
<P>
	However, you can claim a premium deduction only if your total  
qualified medical expenses for the year exceed 7.5 percent of your 
adjusted gross income. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Why says the far more important tax issue concerns the  
ability to exclude long-term care benefits as taxable income. ``In 
light of the fact that a policy might pay out benefits of tens of 
thousands of dollars in a year, keeping all or most of those 
benefits from being treated as taxable income is significant,'' Van 
Why says. 
</P>
<P>
	There is a limit as to how much in benefits from a qualified  
long-term care policy a taxpayer can exclude from income. For 1999, 
the maximum amount is $190 a day, or $69,350 a year. Any benefits 
that exceed that amount would be subject to income tax, Van Why 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Life insurance policies that provide long-term care benefits as  
a rider also can be treated under the same tax rules as a qualified 
long-term care policy. Benefits paid out from a policy whose 
premiums have been paid for by an employer also are not taxable as 
long as the policy was not chosen under a ``cafeteria'' plan. 
</P>
<P>
	What makes a long-term care policy qualified for tax breaks? Van  
Why lists several requirements. A doctor must certify that you are 
unable to perform -- without substantial assistance from another 
person -- at least two out of five or six activities of daily living 
for at least 90 days. These ADLs are eating, dressing, transferring 
(say bed to chair), toileting, continence and bathing. 
</P>
<P>
	In the case of cognitive impairment, such as Alzheimer's, the  
impairment must be considered ``severe'' and require ``substantial 
supervision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Benefits cannot be triggered by a ``medical necessity,'' which  
is when a doctor orders or certifies that care is medically 
necessary, and which may not qualify under the 90-day ADL 
requirement. 
</P>
<P>
	The policy must offer a nonforfeiture option. This option allows  
you to receive limited benefits in the event you are unable to pay 
the current premiums. For example, the policy might not pay out 
benefits for as long as you originally contracted, or the daily 
benefits might be smaller. The policy cannot pay for Medicare 
deductibles or co-insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonqualified long-term care policies generally are less  
restrictive than qualified policies, Van Why says. For example, a 
policy might not have a 90-day requirement for ADLs, the cognitive 
impairment is not described as ``severe,'' or it may pay for 
deductibles for a certain number of days. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Van Why cautions that the benefits of these less  
restrictive nonqualified policies must be weighed against the very 
substantial benefits of not having your benefits taxed. He also 
emphasizes that tax breaks have not officially been ruled out for 
nonqualified plans. The Treasury Department simply has not issued 
tax guidelines for nonqualified plans. 
</P>
<P>
	However, most financial advisers are operating on the basis that  
until the tax issues are clarified, one should assume that premiums 
for these policies won't be deductible and that the benefits will 
be taxable. 
</P>
<P>
	For more information on long-term care policies, Van Why  
recommends ``A Shopper's Guide to Long-Term Care Insurance,'' 
published by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners 
(tel. 816-842-3600). 
</P>
<P>
	You can also ask your state insurance commissioner or agency on  
aging for guides that compare long-term care policies offered by 
companies within your state.

<HEADLINE> Russian Business Paper To Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Wall Street Journal, The Financial Times of  
London and the Moscow Times announced plans Wednesday to launch a 
Russian-language business newspaper for the Russian market. 
</P>
<P>
	The yet-to-be-named publication is to debut in August,  
publishing Tuesday through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	A staff of 20 Russian reporters and editors will staff the  
newspaper, which also will draw content, translated into Russian, 
from The Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper will be owned one-third each by Dow Jones &AMP;  
Company, publisher of The Wall Street Journal; Pearson PLC, 
publisher of The Financial Times; and Independent Media, publisher 
of The Moscow Times and the Russian editions of Cosmopolitan, Good 
Housekeeping, and Men's Health magazines. 
</P>
<P>
	Distribution of the new business newspaper will center on Moscow  
and St. Petersburg at first, with the expectation the paper will 
eventually become a national daily, the three companies said in a 
joint statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Russia poses some unique challenges and opportunities that  
require a unique response -- and that's what this venture is,'' said 
David Bell, chairman of The Financial Times Group. ``Joining forces 
both with Independent Media and Dow Jones &AMP; Company is an effective 
and relatively low risk way of creating the best business newspaper 
for Russia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Karen Elliott House, president of Dow Jones' international  
group, said, ``We think this new venture positions Dow Jones and 
The Wall Street Journal to take advantage of the vast potential of 
Eastern Europe's largest market, while maximizing our chances for 
success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leonid Bershidsky, 27, the business editor of the Moscow Times,  
was named editor of the new publication. Derk Sauer, CEO of 
Independent Media, will be managing director and publisher. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Robinson, former Moscow bureau chief for The Financial  
Times, will serve as consulting editor, overseeing the newspaper's 
use of Wall Street Journal and Financial Times news content on a 
day-to-day basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street Journal Europe editor Frederick Kempe will serve as  
supervisory editor. 
</P>
<P>
	The joint venture will be overseen by a six-person board of  
directors, with two representatives each from Independent Media, 
Pearson and Dow Jones.

<HEADLINE> Star Watch: Claire Danes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The doodles gave her away.  
</P>
<P>
	Try as she might, Claire Danes, the oh-so-serious actress who  
favors doomed and angst-ridden young women, just couldn't keep the 
sober act up much longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Exhibit A: Danes' hotel writing pad, currently filled with puffy  
hearts speared by Cupid's arrows, three puffy thingamajigs and a 
bunch of cute stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearts and stars?  
</P>
<P>
	``When people first meet me, they're automatically  
disillusioned,'' she says with a laugh as she inspects her 
handiwork. ``It doesn't take them long to be demystified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She may have a Golden Globe, she may go to Yale University and  
count Steven Spielberg among her devoted fans, but Claire Danes is 
still very much a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
	You were expecting something else?  
</P>
<P>
	``The trick to dealing with Claire is that you have to remind  
yourself that she's only 19,'' says Scott Silver, who directed 
Danes in her current film, ``The Mod Squad,'' a poorly reviewed 
copy of the acclaimed 1960s TV show about three 
youths-turned-undercover cops. 
</P>
<P>
	``On one level, she's completely composed. And on another level,  
a teen-ager. You have both these things in the same person -- which 
is remarkable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The newsstands agree. Last month, Danes' mugged her way onto the  
cover of teeny-bopper YM magazine, alongside articles on ``41 Ways 
to Make Him Swoon'' and ``Five Tasty First-Kiss Tips.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, wasn't she also gracing the cover of Jane magazine, with  
its mature stories on embattled abortion clinics, the confessions 
of an ex-Hooters girl and fashion tips for Venezuela? 
</P>
<P>
	Now a few weeks shy of her 20th birthday, Danes, an awkward  
beauty with eyes as wide as bird baths, admits she won't be doing 
this tightrope walk between adolescence and adulthood too much 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my last bout of being a reckless teen-ager,'' she  
says. ``My actions will still be excused for the next year or so, 
so I should take advantage of the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That explains her odd foray into action-adventure in ``The Mod  
Squad,'' in which Danes gets to strut around as an ex-druggie in 
Urban Outfitters-like jackets, boot-cut jeans and midriff-bearing 
tops. 
</P>
<P>
	Plus, she gets to blow stuff up.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've never tackled this genre before,'' she says. ``I was  
craving some levity. A huge motivation for me to do the project was 
people's surprised reaction to my decision. They were practically 
appalled!'' 
</P>
<P>
	To be sure, Danes' screen characters haven't lived long or happy  
lives. Danes sprung to fame at age 15 as the hyper-observant star 
of the TV drama ``My So-Called Life,'' a critically acclaimed -- yet 
short-lived -- series about high school angst. 
</P>
<P>
	``I exhausted the idea of adolescence making that show,'' she  
says. ``I explored so many different facets of being a teen-ager, I 
was done! I got it! I was satiated! So when the next crop of films 
came along, I just didn't have an interest discussing those themes 
any more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Danes made her movie debut in ``Little Women,'' and  
co-starred in the tough-to-take dramas ``How to Make an American 
Quilt'' and ``Home for the Holidays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her darker path continued, playing a daughter whose mother has  
died in ``To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday,'' the doomed female lead 
in ``William Shakespeare's Romeo &AMP; Juliet,'' an abused wife in 
``The Rainmaker'' and the melancholy Cosette in ``Les Miserables.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The work I've done has been some intense projects. The  
characters are in real periods of crisis and are in true turmoil -- 
so that's just what I've been exploring lately. I wasn't providing 
escapism,'' she says. ``I wanted to hit straight-on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the time Spielberg singled her out as ``one of the most  
exciting actresses to debut in 10 years,'' Danes-mania was in full 
gear. She made Entertainment Weekly's list of the 12 best actresses 
of the coming decade, and People magazine's 50-most-beautiful list. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's flattering. It's nice,'' she says, unconvincingly.  
</P>
<P>
	``Well, it's just that I'm so hard on myself that whatever  
expectation other people are throwing out at me, I can outdo them. 
It's not something I'm proud of. I want to loosen up a little bit 
and be less harsh on myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Could Yale offer Danes a necessary refuge -- a new beginning?  
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, it's really good for me to be there at the moment. I'm  
fine when I'm completely immersed in either one of the two worlds: 
Hollywood or academia,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they start to conflict or merge, I start feeling  
fractured and confused and I don't know how to handle either of 
them. I've met some amazing people who are my age and I'm not 
shielded anymore by what I experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although she admits loving John Hughes' bubble-gum films as a  
child, as an actress Danes could be the anti-Molly Ringwald, never 
willing to act her age for an easy buck. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really easy to exploit teen-agers because they have  
relatively little power and are adorable,'' she says. Of the 
current crop of teen-orientated fare, she adds, ``It's a phase. The 
interest and infatuation will pass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of her own current phase, Danes is ambivalent. ``I'm meditating  
on where I want to go next. I think I've reached a kind of plateau. 
I'm curious to see what sort of effect my going to school will have 
on my future acting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked what she most fears, Danes responds with a story. She  
recalls being driven one morning to the set of ``Les Miserables'' 
in the Czech Republic. The script that day was filled with grueling 
scenes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were passing through the gates of the studio and I thought,  
'Why do I do this to myself? I really want to be the driver right 
now. I really want to be the make-up person right now! Why am I 
putting myself through this utter torture?' 
</P>
<P>
	``I always refer to that moment when I'm freaked out,'' Danes  
says. ``I always think, 'Well, when am I going to become impervious 
to this nervousness?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Probably never. Welcome to adulthood, Claire.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Woman Survives Fox Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKSVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- A 79-year-old woman was knocked down,  
bitten and clawed by a rabid fox but managed to grab the crazed 
animal and clutch it for 12 hours until her landlord came by and 
beat it to death with a stick. 
</P>
<P>
	``Either she knew what she was doing or she got lucky,''  
sheriff's officer Cathy Lee said.

	Lucy Dover was hospitalized in serious condition and will need  
rabies shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Dover told authorities she was attacked Monday night when  
she went outside her mobile home to smoke a cigarette. The 15-pound 
fox knocked her to the ground, breaking her hip. 
</P>

	She said she seized the animal behind the neck and near the tail  
and held it until her landlord happened to come by in the morning.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed; Dow Up 16.93 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed Wednesday after technology  
shares, falling on a pessimistic earnings outlook, pulled the rest 
of the market lower. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
16.93 at 9,980.42. Broader stock indicators mostly fell. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks opened strongly today as aluminum maker Alcoa released  
first-quarter earnings that soundly beat analysts' expectations. 
The good news from Alcoa, a component of the Dow, propped up a 
number of blue-chip companies. 
</P>
<P>
	But at midmorning, said William Meehan, chief market analyst at  
Cantor Fitzgerald, many Dow stocks gave up their gains. Alcoa 
continued to rise, advancing 1 1/2 to 42 9/16, and financial-services 
companies rose as well. But technology companies began to falter, 
with IBM falling 3 7/16 to 179 9/16, and Hewlett Packard falling 1 
11/16 to 68 5/16. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem, Meehan said, is that stocks are too overvalued to  
withstand even the slightest hint of caution. ``It doesn't take 
much to trigger any kind of stampede,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's catalyst was a warning from Merrill Lynch analysts  
warning of some tough times ahead for the high-tech sector. 
</P>
<P>
	But traders were optimistically looking ahead to an after-hours  
earnings release from Yahoo!, which was expected to beat analyst 
estimates. Yahoo! rose 1 1/8 to 216. 
</P>
<P>
	Revlon rose 2 5/8 to 22 5/8 after the cosmetics maker said it is  
considering the sale of one or more of its businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 3.12 at 1,314.77, and  
the Nasdaq composite index, which is heavily weighted with 
technology stocks, was down 46.36 at 2,516.81. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues were ahead of advancers by a 6-to-5 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 376.1 million 
shares, ahead of Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 0.40 at 612.72, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 0.98 at 716.19.

<HEADLINE> Jury Awards Ex-Anchor More Than $7M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- An anchorwoman who was demoted then fired  
after she went on disability leave has won $7.3 million in a 
discrimination lawsuit against her former station. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that it sends a wake-up call to television stations  
around the country who believe that they may be omnipotent, who 
believe that they're above the law,'' Sara Lee Kessler said after 
the jury's verdict Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does not serve communities for television stations to  
practice corporate discrimination and retaliation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jury ordered WWOR-TV in Secaucus to pay Kessler for demoting  
her and forcing her to take a disability leave after she injured 
her tailbone. 
</P>
<P>
	WWOR attorney John D. Arsenault called the amount of the award  
``ludicrous'' and said the station would appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors rejected the 47-year-old woman's claims that the station  
demoted, then dismissed her because of her age, sex and religion. 
Kessler, an Orthodox Jew, had claimed managers frequently made her 
work past sundown on the Jewish Sabbath. 
</P>
<P>
	Kessler was hired by WWOR in 1976 and became anchor of the  
``News Noon'' show in 1989. She won an Emmy for anchoring coverage 
of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	The award includes more than $2.8 million in lost wages. Kessler  
now works as a reporter at New Jersey Network, where her lawyers 
said she makes about $50,000, compared to $300,000 at WWOR.

	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Former gubernatorial candidate and  
Rep. Jane Harman has decided not to seek her old congressional seat 
in the Los Angeles coastal suburbs next year.

<P>
	The Democrat will focus her energies on her family, teaching at  
UCLA and helping Gov. Gray Davis with fundraising and other 
political activities, a longtime associate said.

</P>
<P>
	Harman, a 53-year-old mother of four, was first elected to

<HEADLINE> 2 Conn. Cops Arrested in Sex Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Two police officers were arrested today  
for allegedly forcing prostitutes to engage in sex under the threat 
of arrest, and a former officer was arrested and immediately 
pleaded guilty to related charges. 
</P>
<P>
	A fourth arrest was possible today, said Sgt. Stephen Adams, the  
police department's executive officer on duty this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers Michael Basile, 41, and Jesus Rivera, 30, pleaded  
innocent to multiple federal charges of violating the civil rights 
of prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
	They were released on $100,000 bail each.  
</P>
<P>
	``If the allegations, in fact, are true, then it's very  
regrettable,'' said Sgt. Michael Wood, president of the Hartford 
Police Union. ``I've known both of the officers involved to be very 
dedicated professionals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former officer, Jose Pizarro, 35, pleaded guilty today to  
one count of aiding and abetting, the U.S. Attorney's office said. 
Pizarro, who resigned from the 480-member department earlier this 
year, admitted providing fellow officers with a camera used to take 
nude pictures of the prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate word on sentencing for Pizarro.  
</P>
<P>
	A federal grand jury has been investigating alleged corruption  
in the police department, including allegations that officers 
pressured prostitutes into providing sexual favors. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 20 police officers have been ordered to appear before  
the panel, The Hartford Courant has reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators also reportedly have been looking into whether  
several officers were involved in two unrelated, unsolved slayings.

<HEADLINE> Mold Delays Senate Day Care Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Inside the building that was supposed to be  
filled by now with the sounds of young children, a potentially 
deadly mold is eating through the walls. After a year of tests and 
much hand-wringing, parents hope the new building can be salvaged 
as the new day care center for children of Senate employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The stachybotrys mold, discovered during an inspection in March  
1998, is especially dangerous to infants -- devastating news for the 
nonprofit center's board of directors, because the new facility is 
to add infants to its young population. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the discovery, everything has moved in slow motion. The  
Capitol architect's office has spent a year testing the mold and 
trying to figure out what to do. The nervous parents have hired an 
environmental consultant with their own money. The National 
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has been asked for 
advice. 
</P>
<P>
	The black mold, still growing in the unfinished building a few  
blocks from the Capitol, is another embarrassment for the Architect 
of the Capitol -- the office that maintains congressional grounds 
and buildings. The office has struggled for a year to comply with 
workplace safety rules imposed elsewhere in America and stumbled in 
attempts to revive a moribund waste recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
	Herb Franklin,spokesman for the architect's office, has moved  
cautiously concerning the day care center, but says it is now ready 
with a plan to eradicate the mold -- a suspect in the deaths of at 
least 12 infants in Cleveland in the past six years and 140 
illnesses nationally. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents, whose children are currently in a smaller building on  
Capitol Hill, remain skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had concerns over the length of time it has taken to get  
things moving,'' said Lisa Tuite, who is president of the day care 
center's board of directors, made up of parents. ``How long does it 
take to come up with a ... plan? We wish we were higher on the 
priority list.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new center, being constructed with taxpayers' money under a  
$1.9 million contract, is slated to care for 68 children, compared 
with 47 now. The center is mainly for children of Senate employees, 
who pay tuition to operate the day care program; no senators now 
have children there. The House has a separate child care facility. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not clear why the mold, which typically grows on  
water-soaked ceilings and walls, appeared in the building. Ms. 
Tuite, a Senate employee, blames both the architect's office and 
the contractor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The contractor didn't do well enough to keep water out of the  
building, and the architect's office was not monitoring the problem 
while it got as big as it did,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents were tipped off about the mold through an unofficial  
phone call to a board member from someone in the architect's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Franklin said officials decided to notify the parents quickly  
when the mold was discovered. If there was a delay, he said, 
``we're talking about a half a day or a day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We had several meetings with the parents' board,'' he said.  
``We decided they would become our partners to make sure a ... plan 
was acceptable to them and to us. We want to make sure that no one 
has the slightest hesitancy to occupy the building,'' which is now 
due to open in September, a year behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Franklin said the parents' consultant and the U.S. occupational  
safety agency, which has been consulted, have agreed the 
architect's plans for ridding the building of the mold appear to be 
sound. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dr. Dorr G. Dearborn of Cleveland, a professor of pediatrics  
at Case Western Reserve Medical School who has researched

	U.S. Lawmakers Get NATO Briefings  
</P>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- NATO allies are exhibiting ``greater  
resolve'' toward continuing air attacks against Yugoslavia, Defense 
Secretary William Cohen suggested as he led a delegation of U.S. 
lawmakers here today for special briefings on the conflict. He 
sought to brace Congress, and the nation, for a possibly extended 
period of further air attacks against Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic's government. He said Milosevic's offer of a temporary 
cease-fire was a charade intended to undermine NATO solidarity.

	Release for U.S. Soldiers Sought  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The speaker of the Cypriot  
parliament said today he was close to arranging the release of 
three U.S. soldiers captured by Yugoslav forces. NATO, meanwhile, 
stepped up its ``surgical'' airstrikes after rejecting President 
Slobodan Milosevic's cease-fire offer. Sandy Berger, the U.S. 
national security adviser, said he was aware of former Cypriot 
President Spyros Kyprianou's efforts to free the Americans but 
urged caution about any imminent breakthrough. And in Macedonia, a 
border enclave where tens of thousands of Kosovo refugees had been 
trapped for days in squalid conditions was emptied.

	New FAA Radar Said To Be Slow  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new $1 billion Federal Aviation  
Administration computer system is proving to be so slow in tests 
that it takes at least twice as long as the equipment it is 
supposed to replace. Agency officials, however, say the slowness is 
a result of design changes suggested by technicians and air traffic 
controllers and are being remedied. Citing an internal report on 
tests conducted last month, USA Today reported today that the 
system was two to three times slower than existing equipment in 
displaying aircraft radar positions and responding to air traffic 
controllers' commands.

	Boston Winner Hits $197M Jackpot  
</P>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- There was just one winning ticket in the six-state  
Big Game's record $197 million jackpot, and it was sold in Boston, 
lottery officials said today. The ticket was sold at a Star Market 
supermarket near Fenway Park, lottery officials said. No one had 
come forward to claim the prize as of late morning. The U.S. record 
for a lottery prize is the $295.7 million jackpot last July in the 
Powerball lottery, played in 20 states and the District of 
Columbia. It was shared by 13 workers at an Ohio machine shop.

	Study Cites 4th Grade Beer Drinking

<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Some of the nation's fourth-grade students  
have already started drinking beer and wine coolers or sniffing 
inhalants on a monthly basis, a national organization that monitors 
drug use among youths reported today. In a self-reported survey of 
26,086 fourth-, fifth- and sixth-grade students nationwide, fourth 
graders said they had used cigarettes (4.1 percent), beer (7.7 
percent) and inhalants (6.3 percent) at some time. Of those fourth 
graders, 2.1 percent said they drink beer, 2.2 percent drink wine 
coolers and 2.2 percent use inhalants on a monthly basis.

researcher said he still had to verify the world record claim of 
the Israeli couple, Dror Orpaz and Karmit Tsubera. The previous

	Redskins Sale To Be Decided

<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- After months of juggling finances and weeks of  
intense lobbying, Howard Milstein was to find out today whether he 
would achieve his goal of owning the Washington Redskins. Or 
whether he would become the first prospective buyer rejected by NFL 
owners in a bid for an established franchise. It appears that 
Milstein and bid partner Daniel Snyder do not have the support of 
24 of the 31 owners needed to purchase the Redskins for a record 
$800 million.

<HEADLINE> McDougal Closing Arguments Begin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Susan McDougal owed it to President  
Clinton to testify if she could have helped clear his name during 
the Whitewater investigation, a prosecutor argued today at the 
close of Mrs. McDougal's trial for refusing to answer grand jury 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Associate Independent Counsel Julie Myers noted that Mrs.  
McDougal was glad that Clinton testified on her behalf in 1996, 
when she was convicted of fraud related to Whitewater business 
deals. 
</P>
<P>
	``But when she had information that according to her would help  
demonstrate the president's innocence ... she selfishly refused to 
provide it to the grand jury or anyone,'' Myers told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
	She also noted that first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton had  
testified when called by the Whitewater grand jury spurned by Mrs. 
McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
	Myers told jurors they would have to weigh the credibility of  
Mrs. McDougal, who says she refused to testify because she feared 
Kenneth Starr's team, against the word of Whitewater prosecutors 
Hickman Ewing and Ray Jahn, who testified in the trial that they 
only wanted the truth. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who is more credible? Two career federal prosecutors vs. the  
defendant who is convicted of four felonies?'' Myers asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal's attorneys have argued that Starr's office was  
out to get President and Mrs. Clinton and wanted Mrs. McDougal to 
falsely implicate them. Mrs. McDougal said she feared being charged 
with perjury if her testimony did not suit Starr's team. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal arrived this morning with her parents, five of her  
six brothers and sisters and other relatives. A member of the 
California jury that acquitted her on unrelated embezzlement 
charges was also in the courtroom to show support. 
</P>
<P>
	Myers said Mrs. McDougal had a duty to testify because she was  
``central to the grand jury's investigation.'' Yet she refused to 
comply with the court order and kept demanding new protections even 
after being granted limited immunity from prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not Burger King. The defendant can't have it her way,''  
Myers said. 
</P>
<P>
	She told jurors that Mrs. McDougal planned to break the law,  
even calling the jail the day before her 1996 grand jury appearance 
to inquire about what she could bring with her. 
</P>
<P>
	``She knew what she was doing,'' Myers argued, describing Mrs.  
McDougal as a stubborn woman who craved public attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal's defense may be hampered by instructions to the  
jury. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr. ruled Tuesday that in  
deciding the criminal contempt charges, jurors cannot consider 
evidence that prosecutors wanted something other than Mrs. 
McDougal's truthful testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury may consider her accusations against Starr only on the  
companion obstruction of justice charge, the judge added. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury instructions, which the judge put in writing Tuesday, were  
to be delivered after closing arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were pleased overall'' with the instructions, Associate  
Independent Counsel Mark Barrett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal, the Clintons' former business partner in the  
Whitewater real estate venture, was indicted after she refused on 
two occasions to answer grand jury questions about the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett said the prosecution was able to block a defense request  
for an instruction that jurors could acquit Mrs. McDougal of 
criminal contempt if she proved she had ``just cause'' to refuse to 
answer the grand jury questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Harris, Mrs. McDougal's fiance and co-counsel for the  
defense, had a matter-of-fact response. ``Some of them we got. Some 
of them we didn't,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Saints Want Ricky Williams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Just when Mike Ditka thought he'd never love  
again, the New Orleans Saints coach saw Ricky Williams and fell 
hard. 
</P>
<P>
	How hard? Well, the man who judges all running backs by Walter  
Payton is willing to give up every draft pick this year, some from 
next year, and a few players as well to get the Heisman Trophy 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to talk to the five teams one through five and see  
who has an interest in taking all of our picks,'' Saints general 
manager Bill Kuharich said on Wednesday. ``Maybe all our picks and 
some other things. We want him. We think he can have an immediate 
impact on our whole team and our season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints don't have a second-round pick; that was traded to  
St. Louis for wide receiver Eddie Kennison. Kuharich said that 
could be a deal breaker. But if a deal can be made, the Saints want 
to make it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this player has an opportunity to make us better all  
around,'' Kuharich said. ``He'll make our receivers better, our 
line better, our quarterback better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams arrived at the Saints camp in the afternoon with little  
knowledge of the team -- ``I know they never won a playoff game, 
right?'' -- and worries about meeting Ditka. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I knew about him was just what I'd seen of him walking up  
and down the sidelines -- yelling,'' Williams said. ``I didn't like 
the look on his face. You know, that mean expression he has. He 
never looked happy, ever. I thought I'd hate to play for him, he 
doesn't smile. I was even afraid of him at the combine, I didn't 
want to meet him. But he's the nicest guy in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ditka spent some time reminiscing about the glory years in  
Chicago, the days when Payton was carrying the ball and the Bears 
were dominating the NFC Central. He also told Williams he wants to 
transfer that game plan to the Saints. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said that when he had Walter, they needed a quarterback,''  
Williams said. ``And he said, `It wouldn't have mattered because 
any quarterback I had was just going to hand the ball off to 
Walter.' 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he likes to run the ball. He's not going throw the  
ball around and turn the it over, he's just going to run the ball. 
They'll get mad at him and it'll be boring but he'll win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints' offense was 28th in the NFL last season, dead last  
in rushing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints are scheduled to pick 12th in the first round. They  
have picks in ever round except the second. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to get a feel for who would be interested in dropping  
down to the 12th spot,'' Kuharich said. ``In dropping down to that 
spot, you get a very different group of players than you get in the 
top 10.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said he hoped the Saints could work out a deal, but  
didn't believe it would happen. He speculated he'd go on the fifth 
or sixth pick. Cleveland Browns director of football operations 
Dwight Clark said Williams impressed him during the workout, and 
Cleveland is the first team New Orleans should talk to. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Saints want to make sure they get him, that's the place  
to go,'' Clark said. ``To me, you've got a great player with little 
knowns vs. a quarterback with a larger amount of unknowns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' agent agreed. Leland Hardy said he believed after  
seeing Williams on Tuesday, the Browns will need only about five 
seconds to make him the No. 1 pick on draft day. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is all about minimizing risk,'' Hardy said. ``Now you  
tell me, what's the greater risk, an unproven quarterback who might 
work out, or a proven running back who was the greatest college 
player in the history of the sport?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kuharich said if a deal can't be made with the Browns, that  
doesn't mean there won't be a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Browns are where we start, but that doesn't mean we have  
to go that high,'' Kuharich said. ``Speculation is that the first 
three teams will take quarterbacks. Of course, the closer you get 
to the sixth spot, the more problematic it becomes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams went to St. Louis Wednesday morning. He was going to  
Washington and Philadelphia on Thursday and Cleveland and 
Indianapolis of Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	He would like to be headed back to New Orleans after the draft,  
however. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's going to happen,'' Williams said of the  
deal the Saints hope to work. ``I want it to. Ideally for me, the 
Saints trade to No. 1 and I'm the No. 1 pick.''

<HEADLINE> A Longer, Meaner Augusta National  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Augusta National tried its new set of teeth  
on 96 players in the first round of the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Mark O'Meara predicted tougher times for the  
field because of Augusta National's get-tough policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of new places to get into trouble we've never  
had before,'' O'Meara said. ``It will be interesting to see what 
happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Augusta National has struck back, retaliating against graphite  
shafts, titanium drivers and souped-up golf balls with the most 
sweeping changes in the course's 68-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	Pine trees have been planted, rough grown, tees moved back,  
bunkers reshaped, greens raised and mounds shaved in a new Masters 
examination of golfing skills. 
</P>
<P>
	The facelift, presided over by new Masters chairman Hootie  
Johnson, created instant criticism. Most players think that far 
from ``Tiger-proofing'' Augusta National it has reinforced its 
reputation as a long-hitter's paradise. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17th hole in particular has been toughened. It's no longer a  
drive and a wedge 400-yard par-4. The tee was moved back 25 yards 
and pine trees planted left and right of the fairway. 
</P>
<P>
	Three-time Masters champion Gary Player said of the hole:  
``Bobby Jones would turn over in his grave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, players could easily drive over the ``Eisenhower  
Tree'' at the edge of the left fairway and have a short iron to the 
green. Now, short hitters have to rifle the ball between Ike's tree 
on the left and the new pines on the right. 
</P>
<P>
	Players were caroming balls off the tree during practice and  
shaking their heads. 
</P>
<P>
	``They hit the tree and it's like a light bulb goes off over  
their head,'' said a spectator, watching the show. ``It's a harder 
hole now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Power hitters, however, might have a solution. John Daly pulled  
out his driver in a practice round, took a mighty swing and the 
ball cleared ``Ike's Tree'' on the 17th hole and landed some 300 
yards down the fairway. 
</P>
<P>
	President Eisenhower hated the pine tree that continually  
blocked his shots on the 17th fairway. He suggested one time that 
the offensive tree be sawed down. 
</P>
<P>
	Clifford Roberts, the late Masters chairman, heard Eisenhower's  
complaint and replied by naming the tree ``Ike's Tree'' and 
ordering more fertilizer and water for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Modern technology and livelier golf balls made the tree a  
non-factor until the tees were moved back. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiger Woods, the 1997 Masters champion, smiles the smile of a  
sly young fox when he talks about the changes. He believes the 
``Tiger-proofing'' has only served to help him. 
</P>
<P>
	``No. 17 in particular is a huge advantage for the long  
hitter,'' Woods said. ``The Eisenhower tree doesn't bother me. I 
just hit the ball over it without even thinking about it. The 
shorter hitters have to work the ball around the tree and probably 
hit 5-irons to the green.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six-times Masters champion Jack Nicklaus wishes officials hadn't  
given a facelift to golf's Mona Lisa. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told Hootie Johnson I wish he hadn't made them, but the  
changes he made are quite good,'' Nicklaus said. ``I like what they 
did on 17. It's played too short and too easy for too long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Meara birdied No. 17 on the way to his Masters title last  
year. He said the hole now demands more respect. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't hit it over the top of the tree now,'' O'Meara said.  
``The course is longer now and it favors the longer hitters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Norman said changes on No. 17 made it a ``dogleg straight  
hole.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It definitely favors the longer hitter who can carry the  
tree,'' Norman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other changes:  
</P>
<P>
	--Moving the tee back 25 yards on the 575-yard, par-5 No. 2 and  
shifting a fairway bunker to the right. 
</P>
<P>
	--Raising the green 2 feet on the 455-yard, par-4 No. 11;  
removing two bunkers; and creating a large bunker in the back. 
Rae's Creek to the left of the green was widened and raised a foot. 
</P>
<P>
	--Grading the mounds to the right of the 500-yard, par-5 No. 15;  
planting 20 pine trees on the right; removing the mound on the 
right of the green and planting six pine trees. 
</P>
<P>
	The course has been remeasured from 6,925 to 6,985 yards.  
</P>
<P>
	The rough is 1 3/8 inches high and will create devilish flying  
lies. It's still far below the 4-inch rough at the U.S. Open or the 
3-inch rough at the PGA. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rough creates a little uncertainty when you're playing the  
ball into the greens,'' Nicklaus said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said the changes were made to ``try to keep up with the  
world of golf. It's the most significant changes ever made at 
Augusta and we're just trying to stay in tune with the times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the motive for the changes was to ``require greater  
accuracy off the tee and put certain hazards back into play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Couples, the 1992 Masters champion, said the manipulations  
will raise scores. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody is going to shoot 18-under again like Tiger did,''  
Couples said. 
</P>
<P>
	His prediction for the winning score?  
</P>
<P>
	``Eight or 10-under will be a great score,'' he said. ``The  
course is really playing mean and tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just the way members at Augusta National want it.

<HEADLINE> Marchment Suspended for Remark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bryan Marchment's mouth got him in trouble and  
gave the San Jose Sharks' defenseman an unwanted night off. 
</P>
<P>
	Marchment sat out Tuesday night's 1-0 victory over Phoenix under  
an NHL suspension for an offensive remark directed at a member of 
the Vancouver Canucks. 
</P>
<P>
	During the second period of a 5-2 victory over the Canucks on  
Saturday in San Jose, Marchment called Donald Brashear, who is 
black, a ``big monkey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Marchment has admitted making the remark,'' NHL hockey  
operations director Colin Campbell said. ``While we accept that 
there was no inappropriate intent on Mr. Marchment's part, we 
cannot excuse the conduct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marchment has been quoted as saying he uses ``big monkey'' to  
describe a bruising, physical player, such as Brashear, who is 
6-feet-2 and weighs 225 pounds.

<HEADLINE> Talk Show Slaying Case Going Slow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- The judge presiding over the $50 million  
wrongful death lawsuit against ``The Jenny Jones Show'' grew so 
exasperated with the slow pace that he pleaded with the lawyers to 
stop bickering. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you guys would just stop the hyperbole this would move  
along a lot quicker -- please,'' Judge Gene Schnelz said before 
adjourning Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The family of Scott Amedure sued the show, claiming its  
``ambush'' tactics humiliated Jonathan Schmitz and drove him to 
shoot Amedure in March 1995, three days after they appeared on the 
program. Amedure revealed he had a crush on Schmitz. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz was convicted in 1996 of murdering Amedure. The verdict  
was overturned because of an error in jury selection, and a retrial 
is set for Aug. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Only four out of a potential 100 witnesses have testified since  
the trial began March 29, and the judge has said repeatedly ``one 
at a time'' while the two lead attorneys argue various points. 
</P>
<P>
	Amedure's family is represented by Geoffrey Fieger, known for  
bombastic and successful defenses of Dr. Jack Kevorkian. The show 
and its producer, Warner Bros., are represented by James Feeney, 
who has defended General Motors Corp. and DaimlerChrysler AG in 
product lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Jenny Jones was to testify today, but lawyers now say she likely  
will not take the stand before next week. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Patricia Cielinski testified that she sat next to  
Schmitz on a 90-minute plane ride after the show and that he was 
disappointed and surprised. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he wasn't mad right there at that point in time, but  
if he thought about it long enough, he'd get mad,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Feeney and Fieger spent 30 minutes fighting over whether Ms.  
Cielinski should testify at all, with Fieger ultimately prevailing.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Faith Hill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Faith Hill still bubbles over with  
enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
	A lot has happened since the country music singer from Star,  
Miss., became an instant star with ``Wild One'' in 1993. Then, she 
sang the praises of role model Reba McEntire and swore she had 
never heard Janis Joplin's classic record of ``Piece of My Heart,'' 
her second single. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill, 31, now rivals McEntire as a country music icon. She's  
collected seven No. 1 hits, culminating with the massive success of 
``This Kiss,'' which crossed over last year to get airplay on rock 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Her fame dramatically increased in 1996 when she married singer  
Tim McGraw. Country music fans haven't had such a high-profile star 
couple since the 1970s and the glory days of George Jones and Tammy 
Wynette. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill and McGraw have recorded two highly successful duets and  
will probably do more. But first, Hill is using her first year 
untouched by pregnancy since 1995 to launch an overdue headlining 
tour. The 21-date first leg begins Friday (April 9) at the Orpheum 
Theater in Minneapolis, and includes Chicago, Milwaukee, Seattle, 
Los Angeles and Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	1. How do you feel about finally being a headliner instead of an  
opening act? 
</P>
<P>
	Hill: Nervous. Excited. Oh gosh, I could go on! ... When I saw  
the stage the other day, I just cried. I can't believe all that 
stuff is mine. And I get to tell it when to move, you know? ... 
There'll be some surprises, but I'm not going to be flying from the 
ceiling or that sort of thing. That would be fun, but I'm not going 
to do it this time around. 
</P>
<P>
	2. You've been a star for five years. Why didn't you headline  
sooner? 
</P>
<P>
	Hill: I wanted to do it right, you know what I'm saying? ... And  
that's why we waited. Now, I can have the things I always wanted. 
I've never even had my own backdrop in all the years I've been 
working. Isn't that funny? Plus, I've had so many opportunities in 
the past to work on some incredible tours. Last year I was part of 
the George Strait festival that played stadiums. I've been able to 
play in front of a million people or so in the five years I've 
worked. 
</P>
<P>
	3. You're asking fans to donate books at each of your shows.  
Why? 
</P>
<P>
	Hill: My father was one of 13 children, and he had to quit  
school at a very young age, and he never learned to read. He had to 
work on the family farm. When I became an adult, I realized what he 
had missed out on. I don't know how he made it. There's such a 
world out there that I want him to discover. So I started this 
foundation, The Family Literacy Project, just to bring awareness to 
illiteracy in our country. ... We're asking the fans to bring a 
book when they come to the show, and the next day they're going to 
be distributed to inner-city schools and hospitals and libraries -- 
just places that need books to read to children. Volunteers from 
America's Promise: The Alliance for Youth will collect the books 
and distribute them. 
</P>
<P>
	3 1/2. What is Volunteers from America's Promise?  
</P>
<P>
	Hill: America's Promise is Gen. Colin Powell's organization that  
is about mentoring children, so they know that they have got a 
chance in this world. ... And also, when you donate a book, you'll 
sign a little card, and before the show we'll have a drawing and I 
get to meet that person. 
</P>
<P>
	4. ``This Kiss'' seems to have put you into another league by  
getting airplay on rock stations. Did that catch you by surprise? 
</P>
<P>
	Hill: Yeah, I was very surprised. I think a station in Seattle  
was the first rock station to play `This Kiss.' I think their 
sister station was a country station and they started playing it, 
and their listeners just responded. Other stations followed suit, 
and we just went for it from there. It's still going. I spoke to a 
radio station yesterday in South Africa, where it's a huge single. 
Isn't that amazing? That just blows my mind for some reason. 
</P>
<P>
	5. You've got two young daughters and a husband with a very busy  
career. How do you balance all of it? 
</P>
<P>
	Hill: Together, we make it work. Our family comes first, and  
from there everything seems to work out. People do it every day. 
The only difference with us is we travel. ... It's definitely like 
a Rubik's Cube. Our organizations work so hard to put our schedules 
together. ... We're never apart for more than three days. 
</P>
<P>
	5 1/2. You've had two wildly popular duets with Tim (``It's Your  
Love,'' ``Just to Hear You Say That You Love Me''). Are there more 
coming, and perhaps a concert tour together? 
</P>
<P>
	Hill: We certainly want to do more of that in the future, and  
possibly even an album together. We just enjoy singing together, 
it's really a beautiful thing. And it would be great to bring it 
all together. It would be a lot of fun. There are no concrete 
plans, but I think that's in the future. We just don't know when.

<HEADLINE> Elderly Residents Are Being Moved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- By most accounts, the relocation of the  
Atlasta Mobile Home Park in Idaho's capital city should have been a 
relatively snag-free, smooth process for its mainly elderly 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
	The ingredients were all there. A patient developer willing to  
postpone construction to move residents and pay some of the costs, 
a mayor who said he wanted to help and a governor who lent his 
clout to get the ball rolling. 
</P>
<P>
	But nearly a year and $500,000 later, the deal is mired in  
court. And the elderly residents do not know where they are going 
to live or whether they will be fortunate enough to be moved as a 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the residents have lived here since the park was brand  
new,'' said Archie Thornton, 65, who has lived there for four 
years. ``A lot of the old-timers give it its flavor and 
complexion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their misfortune has served to underscore the increasing problem  
people, often elderly, are facing across Idaho and other rapidly 
growing states in finding suitable housing. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's Affordable Housing Task Force, set up by former Gov.  
Phil Batt, has won approval of a number of statutory changes to 
make moving older mobile homes feasible as development crowds them 
out of existing parks. 
</P>
<P>
	But affordable housing advocates contend that more and more  
communities are essentially zoning out mobile homes in response to 
the kind of angry home-owning neighbors who oppose the relocation 
of the Atlasta residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Some have called Atlasta their home for more than two decades.  
All were told last June that the land their mobile homes were on 
had been sold by a California company to make way for a strip mall. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we got our first eviction notice last summer, it was just  
unbelievable,'' Thornton said. ``A lot of the older residents took 
it the hardest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With many in their 80s and 90s, residents worried about how they  
would come up with the $2,000 to $3,000 or more to move their 
mobile homes and bring them up to code if a new site was found. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people are just overwhelmed. They don't know what to  
do,'' said 78-year-old Doris Allison, who has lived in the park for 
more than 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The development company that bought the land, Dakota Co.,  
allayed those fears by agreeing to help find a new site and pay the 
associated costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the very beginning, we've put a real priority on keeping  
these people together as a community,'' said Larry Durkin, who 
works for Dakota. ``Several of the homes couldn't be moved or 
upgraded so we bought those homes from them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company's cooperation and an offer from the governor to help  
the residents launched the search for suitable site. Boise Mayor 
Brent Coles, officials with the city's Department of Housing and 
Community Development, the Boise Neighborhood Housing Services and 
the Boise City-Ada County Housing Authority got involved. 
</P>
<P>
	A 10-acre site was eventually found and purchased, but neighbors  
quickly went to court to block the new park. 
</P>
<P>
	About 75 people voiced frequent and angry objections at one  
meeting. Most feared that the relocation would depress the value of 
their homes, some worth more than $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	But Durkin, who checked with assessors, maintained that there is  
no evidence mobile home parks decrease property values. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a claim people use to keep another group of people out  
of a neighborhood,'' Durkin said. ``There's lots of different kinds 
of mobile home parks. These will be fine, well-maintained homes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allison said the legal delaying tactic has put him and his  
neighbors against the wall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Time is of the essence. Our park has been sold,'' Allison  
said. ``We're being stopped by a group of vicious people. To be 
told you're undesirable is not pleasant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dakota, which spent the $500,000 so far, had planned to start  
construction in March. The timetable has slipped to the middle or 
end of June. 
</P>
<P>
	The opposition has prompted some to question how involved the  
mayor's office was after coming on the scene last summer. But Coles 
spokeswoman Suzanne Burton said the city's involvement has never 
waned. 
</P>
<P>
	``City officials are committed to developing a mobile home park  
for these people,'' Burton said. ``They, however, because they are 
not the developer, must let the process run its course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for the persisting complaints about inadequate affordable  
housing stocks, Burton admitted no new mobile home parks have been 
approved in the city for some time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly don't know of the last time we had a new mobile  
home park in the county,'' she said. ``And it's been ages since 
we've had an application for one in the city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Burton said, the mayor ``thinks mobile home living is a  
good form of housing and the city ought to provide means for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But for Thornton, Allison and their neighbors, any effort by the  
city may not come soon enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``They will eventually have to start construction,'' Allison  
said. ``At that time, I truly don't know what we'll do.''

<HEADLINE> Hamed Hires Steward as Boxing Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, England (AP) -- Emanuel Steward, one of boxing's most  
respected trainers, has been hired as a corner coach by Prince 
Naseem Hamed for his fight Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamad will be defending his WBO featherweight title against Paul  
Ingle in Manchester. 
</P>
<P>
	Steward, who has trained WBC heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis  
and 26 other world champions, agreed to be in Hamed's corner for 
his 12th title defense after being asked by Hamed's brother and 
manager Raith Hamed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it would be a good idea to ask Manny, who is the  
best in the world at what he does, if he would work with Naz,'' 
Raith Hamed told the tabloid Sun newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Steward is in England with Thomas ``Hit Man'' Hearns, who is  
fighting fellow American Nate Millar in a cruiserweight bout on the 
undercard. 
</P>
<P>
	Steward will work with Hamed's new trainer Oscar Suarez.  
</P>
<P>
	Saurez is taking charge of his first bout for Hamed since the  
undefeated Briton's acrimonious split with long-time promoter Frank 
Warren. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is possible Manny will be involved with us in the future  
but we are not going to talk about that until after the fight,'' 
Raith Hamed said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ingles' manager, Frank Maloney, who also manages Lewis, said  
Hamed's hiring Steward was a ``gimmick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If Hamed really was serious about having Steward in his corner  
he would have hired him from day one,'' Maloney said Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Westwood: Golf's Globe-Trotter  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- About the only difference Lee Westwood sees  
between himself and David Duval is the places they play. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, they'll play only a group apart as the two hottest  
golfers on each side of the Atlantic tee off in search of their 
first major championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody who wants to be the best in the world has to keep up  
with the one setting the standard,'' Westwood said. ``Tiger and 
David may be the best two at the moment, but I'm not that far 
behind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Westwood comes into the Masters with credentials almost as  
impeccable as those of Duval, who has won 11 of his last 34 starts, 
including his last two. 
</P>
<P>
	Westwood has won 11 times himself in the last two years. But,  
outside of a win in New Orleans last year, they have all come in 
Europe or Asia, keeping Westwood from moving up further from his 
spot as the No. 7-ranked player in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a situation Westwood doesn't think is quite fair, although  
he shies away from staking a claim to the No. 1 spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I've got a good record over the last couple of years.  
I wouldn't compare it to David's,'' Westwood said. ``You know, he 
plays in America. People might say the tournaments are bigger over 
here, but they play in the same conditions as we do. Maybe it 
doesn't test your game as much as playing all around the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Duval is coming off wins at The Players Championship and  
BellSouth Classic a few hours down Interstate 20 from Augusta, 
Westwood's resume is littered with names from more exotic locales. 
</P>
<P>
	The 25-year-old Englishman has won in Malaysia and in the  
Japanese cities of Gotemba and Miyazaki. Last year, he had 
victories in Belgium, Scotland, Germany, England and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like playing all around the world and experiencing all the  
different cultures and such,'' said Westwood, who will play in the 
MCI Classic next week to complete a three tournament PGA swing 
before heading back to the European tour. 
</P>
<P>
	But his only win in America was last year in the  
Freeport-McDermott Classic, and he doesn't play the PGA Tour enough 
to get the added weight of American tour wins into the rankings 
that determine the world's top players. 
</P>
<P>
	He played in only eight PGA tournaments last year, but had three  
top-10 finishes, including the win in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's easier to do it over here because the American rankings  
is loaded in the Americans' favor,'' Westwood said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though they play different tours, Duval and Westwood do have one  
thing in common. Neither has won a major. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval came close last year, losing on Mark O'Meara's 20-footer  
for a birdie on the last hole of the Masters. But Westwood has 
finished over par on both his appearances at Augusta National, and 
has a spotty record in the other majors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to be ready for the tournament this time, where I  
wore myself out the last couple of years doing my preparation,'' 
Westwood said. ``This year I'm going into it only playing nine 
holes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Faldo, the 1996 winner, struggling mightily, and other  
Europeans playing erratically, Westwood may be the best foreign 
chance in the field of 96 at Augusta National. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Americans have won the last two Masters, Europeans won 10  
of the 18 before that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not really trying to beat the rest of the Europeans. I'm  
trying to beat the rest of the field,'' Westwood said. ``Whether 
I'm the European favorite or not doesn't concern me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the field, of course, includes Woods and Duval, who  
will hit his first tee shot Thursday afternoon as Westwood walks to 
the first green. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to keep up with who is playing the best,'' Westwood  
said. ``Whoever is playing the best is going to drag everyone else 
along.''

<HEADLINE> Birth Defects Moms Have Good Babies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Women with birth defects have normal babies a surprisingly high  
96 percent of the time, a Norwegian study found. 
</P>
<P>
	Since many birth defects are at least partly genetic,  
researchers expected to find more of them among babies whose 
mothers had defects. 
</P>
<P>
	What surprised them was that the difference was so small: Birth  
defects were seen in 3.8 percent of babies whose mothers had birth 
defects vs. 2.4 percent of those born to normal mothers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the usual finding of everything looks dark for that  
family,'' said researcher Rolv Skjaerven of the University of 
Bergen. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings are reassuring and fill a major gap in knowledge  
for experts who counsel couples on genetic risks, said Dr. Donald 
R. Mattison of Chicago, medical director for the March of Dimes. 
</P>
<P>
	``While there is an increased risk, it's at a level many people  
might feel comfortable with -- not a huge risk overall,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was published in Thursday's New England Journal of  
Medicine. It was based on records of nearly 460,000 females born 
between 1967 and 1982 in Norway, which maintains a national 
registry that lists birth defects found in the baby's first five 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings mean that mothers with birth defects are 60 percent  
more likely than other women to have children with birth defects. 
But that's 60 percent of a small risk to begin with. 
</P>
<P>
	When such birth defects do occur, they are often the same ones  
that the mothers have, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of the 1,100 mothers had relatively minor  
defects, such as a clubfoot or a cleft lip or palate. Females with 
severe defects often do not make it to adulthood, and those who are 
survive are less likely than other women to have children. 
</P>
<P>
	Skjaerven said he was surprised that the figures were so low,  
because a 1994 study found that if one child in a family had a 
birth defect, the next baby was 7.6 times more likely than normal 
to have the same defect, and 1.5 times as likely to have other 
problems.

<HEADLINE>  Williams Impresses NFL Types </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- There was less of Ricky Williams on display  
during his personal workout for NFL scouts, which was a good thing 
with the draft less than two weeks away. 
</P>
<P>
	The running back was fast and 20 pounds trimmer than in  
mid-February, when he showed up at the NFL scouting combine 
weighing 244 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We liked it,'' said coach Chris Palmer of the Cleveland  
Browns, who hold the first pick in the draft April 17-18. ``What he 
did today was allow a lot of scouts, general managers and head 
coaches to rest easy tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That said, Browns officials don't have a clear-cut choice in  
mind. They are considering Kentucky quarterback Tim Couch, Oregon 
quarterback Akili Smith and Williams. The Browns are scheduled to 
work out Couch in Lexington, Ky., on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, the Heisman Trophy winner from Texas, went though a  
2-hour workout Tuesday at UC San Diego for scouts, coaches and 
general managers. With his dreadlocks tied back in two pigtails, he 
ran three 40-yard dashes, did some agility drills and pass-catching 
drills. 
</P>
<P>
	The proceedings then moved inside, and, with dozens of students  
looking on, Williams bench-pressed 225 pounds 22 times. 
</P>
<P>
	The big moment came when he weighed in at 224 pounds.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just worked really hard,'' said Williams, who went to high  
school in San Diego. ``We had to concentrate so much on losing the 
weight that maybe it took away from speed work, but I mean, I think 
the main thing was getting my weight down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, the NCAA career rushing leader with 6,279 yards, also  
made an impression with coach Andy Reid of the Philadelphia Eagles, 
who have the second pick in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``The No. 1 thing was that he has dropped the weight,'' Reid  
said. ``That's always a concern, somebody's up 20 pounds from a 
normal playing weight. You've just got to (come and) see. We 
understood that he had been on the banquet circuit. But he lost it 
and he looked sharp. That showed me a little something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Being on the rubber-chicken circuit was tough ``only because  
you're not working out,'' Williams said. ``Eating wasn't that bad, 
it's just that you're traveling so much that it's really hard to 
take time to work out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for his diet, ``I just kind of made up stuff,'' Williams  
said. ``I got by. It changed almost every day. I had to work 
extremely hard. It wasn't just strictly diet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hardest thing he gave up?  
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, all sweets. Doughnuts, cheesecake. That's about it. Just  
sweets. Right now I'm going to a doughnut shop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer said Williams was timed anywhere from 4.6 seconds to 4.72  
running against the wind in the 40, and anywhere from 4.43 to 4.52 
in two heats with the wind. Two other college players who were 
being timed, including Smith's cousin, Marquis, suffered hamstring 
injuries on the cold, blustery day. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those in the crowd of 200 watching the workout were  
Cleveland general manager Dwight Clark; Indianapolis GM Bill Polian 
and coach Jim Mora; New Orleans Saints GM Bill Kuharich; and 
Minnesota Vikings coach Dennis Green. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams is so highly regarded that Saints coach Mike Ditka said  
he would trade all six 1999 draft picks and additional future picks 
to move up in the first round and get him. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuharich said the Saints haven't had any discussions yet with  
other teams, ``but that will be part of the package.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams would like to go to Cleveland as the first pick.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great organization,'' he said. ``They have the best  
fans in the NFL. I just see myself fitting in in Cleveland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams and his agent, Leland Hardy, are scheduled to visit six  
teams in three days -- St. Louis and New Orleans today, Washington 
and Philadelphia on Thursday and Cleveland and Indianapolis on 
Friday.

</P>
<P>
	``The No. 1 thing was that he has dropped the weight,'' Reid  
said. ``That's always a concern, somebody's up 20 pounds from a 
normal playing weight. You've just got to (come and) see. We 
understood that he had been on the banquet circuit. But he lost it 
and he looked sharp. That showed me a little something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Being on the rubber-chicken circuit was tough ``only because  
you're not working out,'' Williams said. ``Eating wasn't that bad, 
it's just that you're traveling so much that it's really hard to 
take time to work out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for his diet, ``I just kind of made up stuff,'' Williams  
said. ``I got by. It changed almost every day. I had to work 
extremely hard. It wasn't just strictly diet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hardest thing he gave up?  
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, all sweets. Doughnuts, cheesecake. That's about it. Just  
sweets. Right now I'm going to a doughnut shop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer said Williams was timed anywhere from 4.6 seconds to 4.72  
running against the wind in the 40, and anywhere from 4.43 to 4.52 
in two heats with the wind. Two other college players who were 
being timed, including Smith's cousin, Marquis, suffered hamstring 
injuries on the cold, blustery day. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those in the crowd of 200 watching the workout were  
Cleveland general manager Dwight Clark; Indianapolis GM Bill Polian 
and coach Jim Mora; New Orleans Saints GM Bill Kuharich; and 
Minnesota Vikings coach Dennis Green. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams is so highly regarded that Saints coach Mike Ditka said  
he would trade all six 1999 draft picks and additional future picks 
to move up in the first round and get him. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuharich said the Saints haven't had any discussions yet with  
other teams, ``but that will be part of the package.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams would like to go to Cleveland as the first pick.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great organization,'' he said. ``They have the best  
fans in the NFL. I just see myself fitting in in Cleveland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams and his agent, Leland Hardy, are scheduled to visit six  
teams in three days -- St. Louis and New Orleans today, Washington 
and Philadelphia on Thursday and Cleveland and Indianapolis on 
Friday.

<HEADLINE>  Duke Assistant Succeeds Stewart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) -- The job of revitalizing Missouri goes to a  
man exactly half Norm Stewart's age. 
</P>
<P>
	The school is hoping Duke assistant Quin Snyder, a boyish  
32-year-old hired to a five-year contract on Wednesday, will relate 
to players his predecessor might have driven away in the past. 
Unlike Stewart, who resigned under pressure six days earlier after 
32 seasons -- saying his style was not to be a social worker -- 
Snyder believes the coach-player relationship doesn't have to be 
adversarial. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the same thing to his players in an informal first chat  
a few minutes before a campus news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told them I'll treat them with respect and I know they'll  
treat me with respect,'' Snyder said. ``I hope I can be many things 
to them. Yes, I hope I'm their friend. Being their friend doesn't 
preclude you from disciplining them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players liked what they heard, and gave their new leader a  
standing ovation, along with the rest of the fans in attendance at 
the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Freshman point guard Keyon Dooling, who clashed with Stewart  
last season and considered transferring, didn't attend Stewart's 
farewell news conference. He was all smiles Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could feel the vibes,'' Dooling said. ``There were a  
number of good vibes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For another freshman, center Pat Schumacher, the generation gap  
had suddenly dissolved. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe he knows some of our music,'' Schumacher said. ``That  
would be pretty cool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder is the youngest coach in the Big 12, and one of the  
youngest in the nation. But Missouri athletic director Mike Alden 
didn't mind that Snyder has no head-coaching experience, and the 
former Duke point guard -- only 10 years removed from his playing 
career -- believes his youth can be an advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	He's also proved himself as the top assistant and recruiting  
coordinator the last four years under Mike Krzyzewski at one of the 
nation's perennial powers. Duke lost in the NCAA championship game 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder heeded advice from Krzyzewski, whom he called his mentor,  
and sought a school ``worthy of my passion.'' He also had been 
considered by Vanderbilt, San Diego State and Notre Dame, but knew 
he'd made the right choice when he surveyed the adoring crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``Seeing this here today, I'm convinced it's my turn to show you  
I'm worthy of your passion,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski, who underwent hip replacement surgery on Sunday,  
said during the Final Four he felt Snyder was ready to become a 
head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have had incredible high expectations for him as a player,  
then a coach, and as a friend,'' Krzyzewski said. ``He has 
surpassed my expectations in every way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder doesn't exactly inherit a team on the skids. Missouri was  
20-9 last season and lost to New Mexico in the first round of the 
NCAA tournament. At least three starters return, and there could be 
four if Albert White, who led the team in scoring, rebounding and 
assists, changes his mind about skipping his senior season to try 
the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	But the previous three seasons signaled the end for Stewart, who  
was a combined 51-47 in that period. Another sign he'd lost touch 
because of his gruff demeanor: in the last five years, nine players 
have transferred. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, who has been involved in more than half of Missouri's  
games in 41 years as a player, assistant coach and head coach, was 
not consulted about the hire and did not attend the news 
conference. Alden said Stewart was at his winter home in Palm 
Springs, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Other finalists were John Calipari, recently fired by the New  
Jersey Nets, and Bill Self of Tulsa. Longtime Stewart assistant Kim 
Anderson also was interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	It's no coincidence the hire came on the first day of the late  
signing period, which continues through May 15. Missouri is hoping 
to close the deal on three top recruits. 
</P>
<P>
	Alden said he met Snyder for the first time on April 1, the day  
Stewart resigned, and that there was an immediate connection. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder was the Duke point guard from 1986-89, a period that  
included three trips to the Final Four. He is third on the school's 
career assist list with 575. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder was respectful of his predecessor, to a point.  
</P>
<P>
	``What an unbelievable job he did,'' Snyder said. ``I'm very  
fortunate to have an opportunity to be his successor, to hopefully 
build on that foundation that his sweat and hard work laid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, Stewart's half-court offense is headed for  
the history pages along with the coach who rolled up 634 victories 
at Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to see us push the ball,'' Snyder said. ``I want to  
run. Can we run, guys?''

<HEADLINE> Media Giants To Sell Music Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hoping to beef up their presence online, media  
conglomerates Seagram Co. and Bertelsmann AG are banding together 
to sell music over the Internet. Their efforts will face tough 
competition from the likes of Amazon.com and CDnow, however. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies, through their respective music subsidiaries  
Universal Music Group and BMG Entertainment, plan to leverage their 
relationships with hundreds of musicians to attract Web surfers 
with access to stars, video and audio clips and other proprietary 
content. 
</P>
<P>
	The joint venture announced in New York Wednesday would add  
Universal artists to five existing Web sites run by BMG which cater 
to specific musical tastes, such as peeps.com for hip-hop artists 
and twangthis.com for country music. 
</P>
<P>
	The sites are linked to a new online music store, getmusic.com,  
which would also offer CDs from other labels. All the sites are 
currently running, but the companies expect to launch revamped 
versions this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Publishing under labels such as Geffen, A&AMP;M, Arista and RCA, the  
two companies control about 40 percent of the American music 
market, representing artists across many genres including Beck, 
Kenny G, Motley Crue, Shania Twain and TLC. 
</P>
<P>
	Record companies have been scrambling to come up with online  
music strategies as it becomes easier to download bootleg music 
from the Internet. They are hoping to agree on a digital standard 
that would allow them to control the downloading of music and 
ensure that the companies and artists receive royalties. 
</P>
<P>
	So far the companies are not talking about letting users  
download music themselves, although the move to establish a 
platform in cyberspace could clearly set the stage for such efforts 
in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement of the project received lukewarm views from  
industry analysts, who say that the effort may need to evolve 
before finding success with new consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``In terms of building an online sales site around specific  
music genres, record companies may be putting the cart before the 
horse,'' said Melissa Blane, an analyst with the Yankee Group 
consulting company in Boston. ``First-time online music shoppers 
are more likely to go to a general music site.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If I were Amazon, I wouldn't be afraid right now,'' agreed  
James McQuivey, a senior analyst with the consulting group 
Forrester Research. 
</P>
<P>
	One challenge for the companies is to make sure their online  
sales efforts don't hurt relations with their traditional sales 
outlets. Leading music retailer Musicland Stores Corp. said it 
didn't necessarily see the BMG-Universal project as a threat, but 
Tower Records vice president Mike Farrace said: ``We're never happy 
when a supplier goes into competition with us. We think it's a bad 
idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	BMG already runs a mail order music club, which competes with  
the Columbia House direct sales unit run by Time Warner Inc. and 
Sony Corp. The online operations of BMG's music club would not be 
affected by the arrangement with Universal. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to BMG, Germany-based Bertelsmann also owns the  
publishing houses Random House and Bantam Doubleday Dell, and has a 
half interest in Barnes &AMP; Noble's online bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
	The Montreal-based Seagram, traditionally known as a whiskey  
maker, has been building up its entertainment holdings, which 
include the Universal movie studio.

<HEADLINE> Bell Chiefs, FCC To Discuss Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- SBC Communications Corp. and Ameritech Corp.  
said Wednesday that they are willing to explore with federal 
regulators the possibility of placing conditions on their planned 
merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Communications Commission Chairman Bill Kennard asked  
the chiefs of both local Bell telephone companies last week to do 
that after raising ``serious concerns'' about whether their merger 
would benefit consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are willing to meet with commission staff to explore the  
issues that you have identified,'' SBC Chairman Edward Whitacre Jr. 
and Ameritech Chairman Richard Notebaert said in a joint letter to 
Kennard. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the chiefs said their companies have been providing  
detailed information about their merger to the FCC and continue to 
believe that the merger should be approved without conditions. 
Neither they nor Kennard said what conditions might be set. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC approval is the last major regulatory hurdle for the deal,  
which has been cleared by the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger, valued at $57 billion when it was announced last  
year, would create the nation's largest local phone company. It 
would control 57 million, or one-third, of the nation's local phone 
lines spread across 13 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard, in letters to the companies' chiefs last week, wanted  
to know how the FCC can be assured that the public will receive the 
benefits the companies say will result from the union. He said 
Wednesday he was ``pleased'' the companies had decided to 
participate in the process he had outlined and looked forward ``to 
resolving this matter expeditiously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, Kennard asked how the commission can be  
assured that the merger won't interfere with the companies' 
willingness and ability to open their local phone markets to other 
companies that want to provide competing local phone and other 
communications services. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitacre and Notebaert, in their letter, said the merger ``can  
only increase our willingness to open our local markets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A key component of the merged company's strategy, the chiefs  
said, would be providing long-distance services to local phone 
customers. To do obtain FCC permission to do that, the company must 
open its local markets to rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	The chiefs also said the merged company's plan to provide local  
phone and other services in 30 markets outside its combined 
13-state local region also would boost competition. Such a move 
would have SBC-Ameritech competing against fellow Bell companies. 
</P>
<P>
	By merging, the new company will become more efficient and  
financially able to invade markets outside its region, the chiefs 
said. It will also be in a stronger position to provide new 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	The chiefs said the merger also would increase competition  
inside their 13-state local phone region. One the merger is 
approved, Ameritech will provide competing local phone service in 
four Ohio cities where it doesn't provide such service now, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard wants discussions to begin this month and to conclude by  
late June. The FCC could make a decision on the matter shortly 
thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
	``The process outlined by the FCC puts us in uncharted waters,  
since no other companies have ever had to go through this,'' SBC 
Executive Vice President Jim Ellis said in a statement. But he 
added: ``We expect that we can and will satisfy the FCC and get to 
yes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ameritech also is confident the FCC will approve the merger,  
said spokeswoman Lisa Kim. 
</P>
<P>
	The 13 states involved in the proposed merger are Arkansas,  
California, Connecticut, Kansas, Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma, Texas, 
Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin.
