<HEADLINE> UN Envoy Coming To Nigeria To Assess Bakassi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 9 (Xinhua) -- A special envoy of the United Nations
Secretary-general Boutros Boutros-Ghali may be in Nigeria "in
the next couple of days" on a goodwill mission to follow up
the UN fact-finding team to the country from March 29 to
April 13.
</P>
<P>
Local Press reports said today that during the trip, Mr.
Lakhadar Brahimi would also assess the situation in the Bakasi
Peninsula and report to the Sectretary-general "with a view to
settling the dispute beween Nigergia and Cameroun".
</P>
<P>
"The head of state of Nigeria has welcomed Brahimi's mission,"
the reports quoted UN spokeswoman Sylvana Foa as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria and Cameroun, both claiming to possess the oil-rich
Bakassi Peninsula, have been trading accusations since April 21,
when the fragile peace in Bakassi collapsed.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the UN Security Council, Cameroun's Foreign
Minister Ferdinand Oyono demanded the dispatch of a fact-finding
mission to Bakassi.
</P>
<P>
The letter said Nigeria's deployment of more and more troops
and military equipment during the past few weeks is a clear
indication of its intention to launch a large-scale offensive as
part of its plan to annex the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
And Cameroun would make the "supreme sacrifice" to defend its
territorial integrity, he warned in the letter sent to the UN on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has also accused Cameroun of aggravating the situation
in the peninsula, where forcs of both countries have clashed
intermittently since 1994.
</P>
<P>
The federal government of Nigeria alerted the world on Tuesday
that Cameroun had declared full-scale war against Nigera over the
disputed penisula, announcing that Nigeria would continue to
defend its territorial integrity, especially in Bakassi
Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
According to Nigeria's defence spokesman Brigadier-general Fred
Chijuka, Nigeria has enough envidence to show that Cameroun
has violated all agreements reached on the issue.

<HEADLINE> SDLP to Take Seats in Ulster Peace Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The Social Democratic and Labor Party
(SDLP), the largest Catholic political party in Northern Ireland,
confirmed today that it would take its seats in the peace forum
produced through elections on May 30, reported BBC TV.
</P>
<P>
But the party, which stands for reunification of the whole
island of Ireland but opposes the campaign of violence by the
Irish Republican Army (IRA), declared that it did not consider the
forum as important as the all-party negotiations on the future of
the conflict-torn Ulster to be convened on June 10.
</P>
<P>
The SDLP said it would not have anything to do with any forum
business which might hinder or replace the talks process on
Ulster's future.
</P>
<P>
The SDLP feared that the forum would be dominated by the Ulster
Unionist Party (UUP), the biggest Protestant party in Northern
Ireland in favor of British rule over the crisis-laden region.
</P>
<P>
However, it has still nominated 76 candidates in all 18
constituencies for the peace forum which is composed of 110
representatives to be elected from different parties.
</P>
<P>
In order to placate the Catholics who make up a minority of the
population in Northern Ireland, the British government has
announced that the peace forum will be just a consultative body
and it will have no legislative, juridical or administrative
powers.
</P>
<P>
The British government has also decided the forum will exist at
most for two years.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the IRA's political wing Sinn Fein has put
forth 70 candidates to contest the elections, but it will not take
its seats in the forum.

<HEADLINE> Anti-terrorism Police Units Formally Launched in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Japan today formally launched
anti-terrorism police squads dubbed "special assault teams" (SAT),
ending the long-time secrecy surrounding their existence.
</P>
<P>
The 20-member teams, stationed in seven prefectures including
Tokyo and Osaka, are trained to handle emergencies such as
hijackings and hostage situations, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
SAT squads have been serving in Tokyo and Osaka for almost two
decades, but the matter had been kept top secret even within
police circles.
</P>
<P>
However, faced with a widespread feeling of insecurity among
the public due to homebred terrorism such as last year's sarin gas
attack on Tokyo subways, more openness seemed advisable.
</P>
<P>
"We concluded that people would feel reassured if they knew
about the existence of the teams and that SATs would have a
deterring effect on terrorists," Kyodo quoted a National Police
Agency official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The teams, based in the agency and the prefectural police
headquarters of Osaka, Hokkaido, Chiba, Kanagawa, Aichi and
Fukuoka, are armed with rifles and equipped with high-vision
glasses and other special tools, Kyodo said.

<HEADLINE> OAU-EU Consultative Meeting Ends In Addis Ababa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- A two-day consultative meeting
between the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the European
Union (EU) ended here today, an OAU press release said.
</P>
<P>
The release said that the purpose of the consultation, which
is held bi-annually, is to review areas of cooperation between the
OAU and the EU.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which was led under the joint-chair of Konjit
Sinegiogis, Permanent Representative of Ethiopia to the OAU and
Alberto Balboni, Director for Africa of the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs of Italy, focussed on conflict prevention, management and
resolution in Africa.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, both sides reviewed the efforts made by the OAU
in preventive diplomacy and peacekeeping and underscored the need
for appropriate coordination of the various initiatives undertaken
by the OAU and the EU in these important issues.
</P>
<P>
The release said there is also an exhaustive consideration of
how the EU could support OAU efforts in conflict prevention,
management and resolution, particularly with respect to assistance
to the OAU peace fund and the four specific projects which were
submitted by the OAU for funding by EU.
</P>
<P>
There was a comprehensive review of the situation of conflicts
in different parts of Africa, focusing in particular on the Great
Lakes region, West Africa, southern Africa and the Horn of Africa,
the release said.
</P>
<P>
Both sides pledged to continue to do everything possible to
promote the process of dialogue, peace and stability through
preventive and other forms of peaceful and diplomatic actions, the
release added.

<HEADLINE> Canada Faces Risk of Deflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- After years of fight against
inflation, Canada now faces the danger of deflation, which could
also have devastating effects on the economy.
</P>
<P>
Gordon Thiessen, governor of the Bank of Canada, warned that
there is a risk that the inflation rate will soon fall below 1
percent, the low end of the bank's target.
</P>
<P>
"We felt there was a risk, that's why we pointed it out,"
Thiessen said Wednesday after releasing the bank's semi-annual
Monetary Policy Report.
</P>
<P>
In a low inflation environment, consumers will delay purchases
of big-ticket items on the expectation of even lower prices. "And
that, of course, can have devastating effects on the economy," the
governor said.
</P>
<P>
The federal government and the bank agreed in December, 1993,
to try to keep inflation between 1 and 3 percent, believing that
this level is essential to fostering sustained economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
Consumer prices are now running at an annual pace of only 1.4
percent, close to the 40-year lows hit this decade. In some
fields, such as housing, prices have been dropping, according to
today's local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Just as rising prices can trigger an inflationary spiral,
falling prices can spark the opposite, with the delay in purchases
forcing businesses to cut prices even more. Eventually, businesses
go under or lay off workers who then have no money to spend,
further depressing prices.
</P>
<P>
To stimulate the economy, the central bank has made six
one-quarter-points cuts in short-term rates over the past half
year, pulling the prime rate down to a two-year low of 6.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
Right now, there has been no indication from the bank that it
is willing to cut interest rates faster or deeper. Cutting rates
now might send the wrong signal to investors, Thiessen insisted.
</P>
<P>
The next several months will be the key to how the economy will
perform in 1997 and 1998, he said, adding that consumer confidence
will play a vital role in this process.

<HEADLINE> War Crimes Tribunal to Open Liaison Office in Belgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Deputy Prosecutor of the
International War Crimes Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia Graham
Blewitt said today the tribunal would open a liaison office in
Belgrade next week.
</P>
<P>
Blewitt told local pressmen before leaving Belgrade that the
opening of the liaison office would "greatly facilitate contacts
with victims and witnesses" of crimes committed against Serbs.
</P>
<P>
He said the tribunal had not been able to conduct all the
necessary investigations into crimes committed against Serbs by
Croats and Muslims partly because there was no such an office on
the Serb side.
</P>
<P>
The Hague-based war crimes tribunal was founded under a U.N.
Security Council resolution in May 1993. Since then, 57 people
have been listed so far by the tribunal as war criminals of the
former Yugoslavia, of whom 46 are Serbs, eight Croats and three
Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Blewitt said it was obvious that a one-sided investigation of
war crimes was not conducive to peace in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Bringing war criminals into justice was "very important for the
reconciliation process" of local people in the war-torn Bosnia, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prosecutor also noted the last thing the tribunal
wanted to see was to turn a trial of one man charged with war
crimes into a trial of an entire people and it was absolutely
necessary to avoid mentioning collective guilt in any way.
</P>
<P>
Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his military chief Ratko
Mladic have been indicted by the international war tribunal as war
criminals but the Serb authorities have ruled out sending their
leaders to the court to stand on trial.

<HEADLINE> Central American Presidents Meet to Promote Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTELIMAR, NICARAGUA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Nicaragua's President
today called on Central American countries to make up for the
"lost decade" of the 1980s and strive to make sustainable
development and tourism a reality.
</P>
<P>
With the armed conflicts of the 1980s now over and peace having
returned to most of the region, Central America should take
advantage of its natural attractions and culture to build itself
into a major world tourist destination, said President Violetta
Chamorro.
</P>
<P>
The president was speaking at the opening ceremony of the 18th
Central American Summit on Tourism and Sustainable Development in
the beach resort of Montelimar on the Pacific coast of Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
The presidents of Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras
and Panama and leaders from El Salvador and Belize attended the
summit and German President Roman Herzog was a special guest.
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguan president said that in 1990, Central American
leaders met in the same place, but under quite different
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
"Today, six years later, there have been enormous
transformations in Central America. Total peace has been reached
in Nicaragua and El Salvador. Guatemala has continued its
dialogue process and is currently in the final stage of its quest
for peace," she said.
</P>
<P>
In an increasingly competitive world, Central Americans "must
make up for the time that we lost in the decade of the 1980s" due
to the civil wars.
</P>
<P>
"We must take advantage of our privileged geographical
position, our natural tourist attractions and our cultural
attractions to offer the world a tourist destination with a
regional character," she said.
</P>
<P>
The German president told the conference that after the bloody
fighting which marked image of Central American in the 1980s, the
region is now a model of a successful process of peace and
democratization.
</P>
<P>
Herzog said that "the European Union and Germany back Central
Americans with all the means within their reach because they are
convinced that there is no other alternative to association among
regions."
</P>
<P>
This afternoon, the Central American presidents will discuss
concrete action to promote regional tourism. The final documents
of the summit are expected to be signed Thursday.

<HEADLINE> EU Partners Unlikely to Back Easing of Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Britain's European Union (EU)
partners are unlikely to support an EU Commission proposal to seek
an easing of the global ban on British beef product exports.
</P>
<P>
The EU Commission decided early Wednesday to recommend easing
the ban on British beef products to allow the export of gelatine,
tallow and semen.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, Britain would be required to comply with
strict processing conditions for the by-products and once the
measures were fullly implemented, the EU Commission would consider
lifting the six-week-old ban.
</P>
<P>
However, Germany, France and other EU countries remained
opposed to any softening of the by-products for the time being,
according British press reports.
</P>
<P>
German Agriculture Minister Jochen Borchet, reportedly said
that Germany would oppose any easing of the strict restrictions on
British beef and by-products until more scientific evidence was
produced to confirm their safety.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, French Agriculture Minister Philippe Vasseur also
made it clear that any such move would be premature and could
trigger a consumer boycott of all French beef.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts say that EU officials are striving to defuse the
beef crisis before the EU summit to be held in Florence in June to
avoid a confrontation between Britain and its EU partners.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister John Major has called on the EU
Commission president early this week to hold an emergency EU
summit to seek a quick solution to the beef crisis.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed the global ban on British beef exports in March
when the British government admitted that there was some possible
link between BSE or mad cow disease and its human equivalent CJD
disease.

<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's state radio claimed
on Wednesday that over 100 civilians were killed on Monday by
rebels at Bendu-Malen in the Pujehun district, 46 miles from Bo
in the South.
</P>
<P>
The radio said the "massacre" was reported on Wednesday by
local hunters who returned to Bo from Bendu Malen where they had
gone to monitor the current ceasefire between the government and
the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels.
</P>
<P>
The civilians who died were mainly between 50 and 75 years old
while teenage captives were taken to the main rebel base called
Camp Libya in the south.
</P>
<P>
One journalist who accompanied the hunters said children under
five years were abandoned by the rebels who later moved on to
Mattru, two miles from Jimmy Bagbor chiefdom also in the south
where 16 other civilians were beaten to death by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
There has been no any other independent confirmation of the
report.
</P>
<P>
Reliable sources said a government statement on the incident
is to be made shortly.

STOCKHOLM, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto today met with her Swedish counterpart, Goran Persson, to
discuss trade relations and request more Swedish aid.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Persson told Bhutto that Sweden's strong

<P>
Bhutto is scheduled to visit the Stockholm headquarters of

According to official sources, Swedish exports to Pakistan,
including telecommunications equipment, forestry products and
trucks, reached 79.4 million dollars in 1995, while its imports,
mainly textiles, amounted to 74.3 million dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Business confidence in Britain is
down in most regions, with engineering employers saying that
economic recovery would be a "long and slow process," according to
the latest survey by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI).
</P>
<P>
In its latest regional industrial trends survey, the CBI said
that confidence fell in all but two areas of Britain, the South
East and the North West.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing orders fell sharply in six regions in the four
months to April, the survey said, with firms in Wales, Yorkshire
and Humberside showing the greatest fall in orders.
</P>
<P>
The survey, produced jointly with the consultancy firm Business
Strategies and covering more than 1,200 companies, also showed
that manufacturing employment is expected to fall in six regions,
and is flat in four others, with only marginal growth in Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
CBI leaders said that while investment in the Midlands and
Wales is expected to grow the fastest in the UK, in all but four
areas of Britain a net majority of firms said they are working
below capacity.
</P>
<P>
Richard Holt, a CBI director, said that the survey results are
consistent with slow economic growth and have confirmed the
generally gloomy outlook for UK manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
He said the CBI is reviewing its UK GDP growth forecast and is
likely to revise it downwards to about 2 to 2.5 percent. However,
he said businesses are optimistic for the second half of the year.

<HEADLINE> US Asia Society Annual Conference Opens in Seoul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Asia-Pacific countries and regions
need to liberalize trade and investment more to greet the coming
century, South Korean President Kim Young-sam said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the seventh annual conference of the Asia Society
of the United States opened here Thursday evening, Kim proposed
Asia-Pacific nations should strengthen regional cooperation,
expand exchanges with other parts of the world and increase dialogue
on security issues.
</P>
<P>
"The forthcoming century will bring challenges as well as
opportunities for Asians. Lest it should let such challenges and
opportunities pass by, I believe, Asia must further open up and
actively move toward globalization," he said at the three-day
conference which was attended by representatives of a dozen
countries and regions including China, Japan, Singapore, Vietnam
and Hongkong.
</P>
<P>
Kim also reiterated South Korea's determination to expand
cooperation with other developing countries, saying, "Korea will
be at the forefront of the move to implement the ideal of
liberalizing investment and trade and will help build a bridge
between advanced and developing countries."
</P>
<P>
The Asia Society was founded in 1956 by U.S. business tycoon
John Rockefeller Jr. with the purpose of increasing understanding
and communication between the Americans and Asians.

<HEADLINE> 11 Israeli Arabs Arrested in East Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Eleven Israeli Arabs from east
Jerusalem have been arrested by the Israeli General Security
Services (GSS) on suspicion of helping the terrorists involving
in the recent suicide bombing attacks, Israel Radio reported
today.
</P>
<P>
They were suspected of helping the terrorists who carried out
the two suicide bombing attacks in Jerusalem and the Ashkelon
junction attack in February and March, which killed at least 40
people and wounded dozens of others.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance Movement, or Hamas, claimed
responsibility for the three attacks, as well as another suicide
bombing attack in the Dizengoff shopping center in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
The 11 men were arrested shortly after the suicide attacks,
but until today the Israeli police had been refusing to release
the details of the story, the report said.
</P>
<P>
They were recruited to Hamas in the Gaza Strip, where they
undertook military training, said the report, adding that some of
them transferred explosives from Gaza to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
It was also disclosed today that the GSS has arrested Akram
Salameh, brother of the Hamas fugitive Hassan Salameh, who
recruited and operated the suicide bombers responsible for the
Jerusalem and Ashkelon attacks.
</P>
<P>
Akram Salameh, 23, a resident of Khan Yunis refugee camp in
the Gaza Strip, was arrested in April when he returned to Gaza
following a trip to Sudan.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that his brother, as well as himself, had
undertaken military training in a camp of Ahmed Jibril's PFLP
(Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine) General Command,
when they were deportees in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, also in east Jerusalem today, a 41-year-old
Palestinian was shot and wounded by Israeli border police close to
the Damascus Gate of the old city of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
According to an Israel Radio report, the shooting occurred as
dozens of Palestinians threw stones and bottles at the border
police patrolling around the Damascus Gate.
</P>
<P>
The man was evacuated to hospital, where his wounds were
described as light.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli police are reportedly investigating the
circumstances of the incident, and a few Palestinians were
detained at the scene for questioning.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Prospects are bright for South Korea
and Russia to expand cooperation in the 21st century, visiting
South Korean Foreign Minister Gong Ro-myung said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing students of the Moscow International Relations
Institute, Gong said that South Korea, which has become one of the
most affluent countries in the Asia-Pacific, wants to be a good
friend of Russia.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that Russia "will become a good
neighbor of the Republic of Korea."
</P>
<P>
On economic relations, Gong said a special effort should be
made to overcome the gap between rapidly-growing trade between the
two countries and the slow growth of South Korean investment in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Trade between South Korea and Russia totaled 3.3 billion
U.S. dollars in 1995 and is expected to reach five billion dollars
this year.
</P>
<P>
The minister also called for more political cooperation between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Gong, who arrived in Moscow on Monday for a four-day official
visit, has met several high-ranking Russian officials including
his counterpart, Yevgeny Primakov, Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly
Ignatenko and Federation Council (upper house of parliament)
Speaker Yegor Stroyev.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Foes Yet to Agree on Boundary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The two foes of Bosnia, the
Muslim-Croat federation and the Serb republic, still have not
resolved all the disputes on their boundary, a peace
Implementation Force (IFOR) spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
Major Simon Haselock of the NATO-led IFOR said at the daily
briefing that representatives of the two parties met with IFOR
arbitrators for seven hours Wednesday at the 25th such meeting
since negotiations began earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
"Disappointedly, while some of disputed areas have reached the
stage of setting talks for apparent settlement and some documents
have begun circulating for government-level signature, some of the
areas have fallen back to dispute," Haselock said.
</P>
<P>
Haselock said that negotiation on the demarcation line in the
Sarajevo area of Dobrinja is particularly difficult and the matter
will be taken over by IFOR commander General Smith and the
international community's High Representative Carl Bildt.
</P>
<P>
During the peace negotiations last year, the Bosnian warring
factions agreed in general to the so-called "inter-entity boundary
line," but since it cuts through blocks and even apartments,
certain adjustment has to be negotiated.
</P>
<P>
However, because of opposition from local residents, both sides
have stiffened their positions during the negotiation, according
to NATO officials.

<HEADLINE> World Bank to Provide More Loans to Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank is to provide Vietnam
with loans worth about 500 million U.S. dollars over the next
three years to help economic reform, a local official report said
today.
</P>
<P>
The bank's president, James Wolfensohn, said continuing
financial support for Vietnam has been made possible thanks to the
positive results of the economic reform program.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn, who is paying a four-day working visit to Vietnam,
said the country ranks second in a list of states receiving
preferential loans from the bank.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet
Monday, Wolfsensohn said more private companies would benefit from
financial support to be provided by the International Financial
Corporation(IFC), the bank's private sector funding arm.
</P>
<P>
The IFC, which has lent money to a number of infrastructure,
hotel and manufacturing projects in Vietnam, is looking for
potential sponsors for establishing eight loan schemes worth an
estimated 135.2 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
IFC investment in Vietnam is expected to rise to 375 million
U.S. dollars in near future.

<HEADLINE> UK Tory Party Hit by Corrupting Votes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Britain's ruling Tory party was hit
today by an independent inquiry that six leading figures in
London's Westminster council guilty of a 31 million pound (47
million U.S. dollar) homes-for-votes scandal.
</P>
<P>
A report made by Westminster district Auditor John Magill
stirred up a huge row in the House of Commons as it underlined an
atmosphere of corruption within the Conservative party in the
run-up to the general election scheduled for next May.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the Westminster council, a banner-bearer
council of the Conservative party in London, deliberately cleared
tenants from council houses in marginal voting districts and then
sold them off cheap to people more likely to vote Conservative.
</P>
<P>
The intention and purpose of the strategy was to seek to
manipulate the composition of the electorate to gain an unfair
advantage for the Conservative party, the report maintained.
</P>
<P>
The report ordered former council leader Lady Shirley Porter,
two other former councillors and three officials to repay the
money spent on the scheme.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Major refused to condemn the six leading
members of the Westminster council and said that they had made
"clear-cut protestations of innocence."
</P>
<P>
Major indicated that he would wait for the outcomes of their
appeals before passing judgement.
</P>
<P>
But Labor leader Tony Blair claimed that the six had acted with
the "knowledge of the Conservative party," and urged Major to
condemn the six.
</P>
<P>
Blair said that the prime minister had promised that he would
condemn them if the preliminary findings were confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Labor local government spokesman Frank Dobson threatened that
if the government would not hold a public inquiry into the
scandal, an incoming Labor government would.
</P>
<P>
Lady Shirley Porter, once a close ally of former Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher, attacked Margill's report as an "extraordinary
and unfair decision" and said that she would make a legal appeal
against it.
</P>
<P>
During the past four years, the Conservative party has already
suffered a series of sexual and financial scandals among its
parliament members and its popularity has fallen steeply.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Sees No Possibility Of OAU Action Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
today said he saw no possibility of Nigeria's suspension from the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) at its forthcoming summit in
Cameroon as punishment over human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held on Thursday, he said Nigeria which
has been suspended its Commonwealth membership, would not be
punished by the group of African states.
</P>
<P>
"The spirit of brotherliness prevails even where wrongs are
recognized and taking measures against a brotherly state is not
easy," he said.
</P>
<P>
"African states have a problem that we are not strong enough
to criticize ourselves, so Nigeria will not be punished by OAU
unless some sanctions become United Nations-imposed," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mugabe said Zimbabwe would not take an individual
stance against Nigeria until discussions with other southern
African Development Community (SADC) countries.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking at how our region will react to the
recommendations made by the group. The SADC countries will get
together and respond to the call for tougher measures against
Nigeria," he said.

HARARE, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mubabe
said today that his government will not rush into privatization
if the process turns out to benefit foreigners at the expense of

He said that the privatization should not sacrifice state

</P>
<P>
He ruled out the privatization of public enterprises through

a time the country is trying to facilitate participation by

<HEADLINE> Malaria Spreads Rapidly in Azerbaijan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Malaria is spreading once again at an
alarming rate in Azerbaijan after being practically eradicated in
the eastern European country for more than a quarter of a century,
the World Health Organization (WHO) said today.
</P>
<P>
According to epidemiological data reported by the government of
Azerbaijan to the WHO, malaria cases reached 2,802 in 1995 in the
country where the disease was practically eradicated in 1960. As
recently as 1993 only 23 indigenous cases were reported in
Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
The WHO said that the main cause for the epidemic was the
recent influx of large numbers of displaced persons into the
southern parts of the country where the disease is endemic.
</P>
<P>
As many as 900,000 Azerbaijanis have fled their homes as a
result of the military conflict and resettled mainly in the
southern districts. As living conditions there are extremely poor
for the displaced, many of them roam widely around Azerbaijan in
search of work, which helps to spread the disease into other
mosquito-infested areas.
</P>
<P>
In the view of WHO experts, further deterioration in the
situation may nullify past efforts in the region that successfully
prevented and controlled the disease, and could lead to
reintroduction of malaria infection into neighboring countries
such as Armenia, Georgia and the Russian Federation.
</P>
<P>
The WHO said that it was working closely with the U.N.
Children's Fund (UNICEF) to improve the capabilities of
Azerbaijan's health personnel in malaria control and the provision
of drugs for treating the disease.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Forces Shell South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli occupation forces fired
artillery shells at the heights opposite the Israeli
self-proclaimed "security zone" in south Lebanon earlier today,
causing no casualties.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said that the Israeli forces, from their
positions at Aishiyeh and Zafateh in the buffer zone, shelled
Iglim Al-Toffah, the heights used to be a springboard for Moslem
guerrillas to launch cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
They said that 15 120mm and 150mm artillery shells hit Jebal
Al-Rafih, Harj Al-Wazani and Wadi Akhdar around 9:00 a.m. (06:00
GMT), and columns of black smoke were seen rising over the
bombarded venues.
</P>
<P>
Following the bombardment, Israeli warplanes carried out
intensive reconnaissance flights over the areas of Nabatiyeh and
Iglim Al-Toffah.
</P>
<P>
Local military observers noted that today's bombardment came
on the eve of a scheduled meeting in Washington of the five member
states of a proposed committee assigned to monitor the cease-fire
in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The first meeting of the committee, which groups Lebanon,
Syria, Israel, the United States and France, scheduled for Friday
was called for by the United States in a bid to iron out their
differences regarding the formation of the committee which was set
up as part of the April 26 understanding that ended Israel's
17-day military strikes in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Israeli gunships intercepted in
eastern Mediterranean water near the Lebanese coast this morning
a cargo of used cars from Germany.
</P>
<P>
The cargo was checked and released seven hours later to
continue its voyage to the southern Lebanese port city of Sour.
</P>
<P>
Militants of the Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of
God, launched an attack on a patrol of the Israeli-backed South
Lebanon Army (SLA) militia inside the Israeli-occupied border
strip this morning. Security sources said two militiamen were
seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Islamic Resistance, the military wing of
the Shiite Hezbollah, said that one group of its fighters
detonated an explosive device targeting an SLA patrol on the road
between the villages of Tahra and Dabsheh at 8:45 a.m. (05:45 GMT).
</P>
<P>
"The attack led to the killing and wounding of all the members
of the patrol," the organization said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwea White Farmers Warned Not To Undermine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe government has warned
white commercial farmers not to frustrate the land acquisition
exercise.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here on Thursday, President
Robert Mugabe said his government would fulfil the recent
presidential promises to acquire more land and resettle peasants
in ecologically fragile communal lands.
</P>
<P>
"We will not tolerate any resistance at all to land
acquisition," Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would only pay what it considered to be
"fair" compensation for the farms to be acquired, and this would
only apply to developments such as property and irrigation
systems.
</P>
<P>
In a recent notice, the government said it would compulsorily
acquire 23 large scale commercial farms with a total of about
50,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
But most of the 23 white farmers have lodged their objections
with the Ministry Of Lands and Water Resources. They claimed
their farms were fully utilized, highly productive and employed
up to 120 people each.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese President Calls for Israel's Trustworthy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi
tonight called for "a trustworthy and delicate implementation" of
the cease-fire understanding reached on April 26, stressing that
it would be "a test for Israel's intentions" before the world.
</P>
<P>
In his address to a regional conference in the American
University of Beirut, Hrawi said, "A trustworthy and delicate
implementation of the April understanding is a test for
Israel's intentions in respecting the world will."
</P>
<P>
More than 160 Lebanese civilians were killed and some 400
wounded in 16 days of Israeli bombardment in south Lebanon last
month before the cease-fire understanding was reached.
</P>
<P>
Opening the 31st Middle East Medical Conference, the Lebanese
president stressed that a major step in enforcing the April 26
understanding was to prohibit Israel from repeating the "crimes"
like the one it committed against Lebanese refugees in a camp of
U.N. peacekeeping force in south Lebanon last month.
</P>
<P>
"First, Israel should be forbidden from committing the crimes
for which it is famous, with the evidence that it has angered the
United Nations to show the organization's shame at some (crimes)
Israel perpetrated against Lebanon and the international law and
human rights," Hrawi said.
</P>
<P>
In a report issued Tuesday, the international body said
Israel's shelling of the U.N. camp at the southern Lebanese town
of Kana, which killed more than 100 civilians who had sought
shelter in the camp, was "unlikely the result of gross technical
or procedural errors."
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese President underlined that his country would never
abandon its decision to pursue the just and comprehensive peace in
the Middle East no matter the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
"We are with the just and comprehensive peace," Hrawi said,
"this is our decision and we will never depart from it no matter
how the maneuvers multiplied and how the instigations and
pressures varied."
</P>
<P>
"We will not delay this peace, because we want the liberation
of our land, but we will not hasten the peace at the cost of the
right and honor."
</P>
<P>
Hrawi pointed out that the peace could not be realized by one
side, or between the two sides when one of them was allowed to
launch aggressions without supervision or limitation and the
other was deprived of its right on its land, its life and honor.
</P>
<P>
Calling for the Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon, the
Lebanese President reiterated that after the withdrawal, "the
Lebanese state will guarantee the security in south Lebanon and
western Bekaa."

WASHINGTON, May 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton today
called on Greece and Turkey to resolve their disputes peacefully.
</P>
<P>
"We believe a lot of progress can be made in that part of the
world," Clinton said when welcoming visiting Greek President
Constantinos Stephanopoulos at the White House.
</P>
<P>
The meeting has been the first one between the U.S. and Greek
presidents in more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Stephanopoulos said that Greece is willing to resolve its
regional conflicts without force.
</P>
<P>
"Greece is confronted with certain obstacles. My country deals
with them in a peaceful manner," he said.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both members of the U.S.-led North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO), have long been at odds over
territorial waters, airspace and mineral rights in the Aegean and
the divided island of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a Greek coast guard patrol boat opened fire on a
Turkish fishing boat that had supposedly smuggled illegal immigrants
onto an islet in the eastern Aegean Sea.
</P>

Washington has been trying to mediate between its two NATO
allies in an effort to strengthen the southeastern flank of the

<HEADLINE> Grants for Drug Courts Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno
announced today grants for new "drug courts" that allow
first-time, non-violent drug users to choose rehabilitation over
prison.
</P>
<P>
About 80 drug courts are in operation with major funding from
the Clinton administration, and Republicans have criticized it as
a misplaced priority.
</P>
<P>
Reno announced 8.5 million dollars in grants for 16
communities, including Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Fulton County,
Georgia, and Kalamazoo, Michigan.
</P>
<P>
The administration's new director of the Office of National
Drug Control Policy, retired Army General Barry McCaffrey, joined
Reno for the announcement.
</P>
<P>
McCaffrey was optimistic despite remarks Representative William
Zeliff, Republican from New Hampshire, made at an oversight panel
hearing Wednesday at which the anti-drug fighter testified on the
administration's new policy against drugs.
</P>
<P>
Zeliff, who chairs the panel, said President Clinton's drug
strategy over the last three years was "a major policy failure."
</P>
<P>
"Instead of making prevention and education the cornerstone of
his strategy, the president has favored treatment programs with a
weak track record," he added.
</P>
<P>
Reno and McCaffrey said today the track record was anything but
weak.
</P>
<P>
The attorney general said the recidivism rate reported by the
existing drug courts ranges "from zero to 20 percent."
</P>
<P>
McCaffrey said treatment instead of imprisonment makes economic
sense for first-time, non-violent drug users -- drug traffickers
or repeat offenders are not processed through drug courts.
</P>
<P>
McCaffrey said that untreated drug offenders simply put in
prison were a danger to society.

<HEADLINE> Some Canadian Investors to Be Barred From US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Canadians who have invested in Cuba
would know within a month whether they will be barred from
entering the United States, today's Ottawa Citizen newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
A blacklist of Canadians who could be denied entry into the
U.S. is expected to be made public shortly after the U.S.
publishes the implementing regulations of the Helms-Burton act,
which was passed on March 12.
</P>
<P>
"After the guidelines have been published, the names of
individuals associated with trafficking will be added to the list
of people who are excluded aliens maintained by the State
Department and Immigration and Naturalization Service," Nick
Burns, U.S. state department spokesman, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the act will not affect visas for Canadians who began
operating on "confiscated property" before March 12.
</P>
<P>
"In general we're seeking to maximize pressure on the Castro
regime, but we want to minimize the impact on our allies and our
trading partners," Burns added.
</P>
<P>
This list will be shorter than expected, consisting of a
handful of "key investors" that the U.S. wants to serve as an
example to those who are intended to invest in the Caribbean
island of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Ian Delaney, chief executive of the Toronto-based Sherrit Inc.,
could be included on the blacklist, the paper said. The company is
the biggest Canadian mining concern in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Canada has maintained close economic and trade ties with Cuba.
It is one of Cuba's biggest sources of investment, and the two-way
trade between the two countries approached 450 million U.S.
dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government has protested vehemently against the
Helms-Burton act, accusing it of violating the North American
Free-Trade Agreement and the principles of the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
Canada has also hinted that it could retaliate directly against
U.S. firms that sue Canadians.

LONDON, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Queen Elizabeth II is to serve
British beef at a state dinner in honor of President Jacques
Chirac at the Buckingham Palace next week when the French guest
visits Britain, announced a Buckingham Palace spokesman this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The queen personally chose to put beef on the menu at the start
of President Chirac's four-day state visit next Tuesday, despite
the scare caused by BSE, known as mad cow disease among Britons,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
And it was the custom on state visits to serve the "best
examples of British cuisine" and beef would be among the choices,
he added.
</P>
<P>
On April 29, Prime Minister John Major also served British beef
in honor of his German counterpart, Helmut Kohl, when he paid a
one-day visit to Britain.
</P>
<P>
Britain is trying every means to urge the European Union to
lift its worldwide ban on British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
But Germany, France, Italy and a number of other EU member
states still oppose lifting of the ban unless Britain takes tough
measures to overcome the BSE crisis.

<HEADLINE> Serbian President: Economic Development, Primary Task </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 9 (Xinhua) -- President of the Yugoslav Republic
of Serbia Slobodan Milosevic said today that economic recovery and
development were the primary tasks of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
While touring the Yugoslav town of Smederevo, Milosevic said
conditions had been created for a successful fulfillment of the
task, which would help improve the standard of living and overall
quality of life.
</P>
<P>
After visiting the Sartid 1913 metallurgical complex, he said,
"An increase in production and successful development have been
registered after the suspension of the international community's
sanctions."
</P>
<P>
The three and half year-long U.N.-endorsed sanction that was
ended in November of last year had devastated the Yugoslav economy
and driven most people into poverty. The Yugoslav government
estimated that the direct economic losses amounted to 50 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian president also said Sartid's management and workers
had succeeded, despite great pressure and sanctions, in preserving
the company's facilities and maintaining the necessary production
and had now restarted regular production at a level never realized
before, according to the Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Sartid plans to produce between 700,000 and 750,000
tons of iron, steel, steel bands and sheets, 90 percent of which
will be exported for about 300 million dollars, the agency said.

LUSAKA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
stressed today that there is no political crisis in Zambia over
the adoption of the draft constitution.
</P>
<P>
President Chiluba told reporters at state house here that if
there was a crisis, Zambia would call for an international summit

</P>
<P>
The current problem is that the opposition parties are not

<HEADLINE> Former Turkish Premier Faces Second Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Parliament this evening
backed a second motion by the Islamist opposition for an
investigation against former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller
concerning corruption allegations during the sale of state-owned
shares in Turkey's leading automobile plant TOFAS.
</P>
<P>
The motion, tabled by the Welfare Party (RP), was passed by a
majority of 376 votes to 141 in the 550-seat parliament.
</P>
<P>
Just two weeks ago, the assembly passed a RP motion to probe
into Ciller over alleged irregularities in government contracts
concerning the electricity distribution company DEDAS, delivering
a blow to Turkey's first woman prime minister, now the chairwoman
of the True Path Party (DYP).
</P>
<P>
Changing the tactics in defending her political career, Ciller
this time "asked" the parliament to open the inquiry and told the
assembly that she herself would cast a "yes" vote for such an
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
She made a speech before the voting, claiming that she had
done everything for the country.
</P>
<P>
"If it is for the interests of the state, I'll still do it for
hundred and thousand times." she said.
</P>
<P>
The inquiry motion says DYP leader Ciller, then prime
minister, allegedly opened the TOFAS tenders in her office prior
to the official opening and contacted related companies on the
sale of the plant's shares.
</P>
<P>
Ciller challenged the pro-Islamic Welfare Party, saying "if
you look for a way to power, you should do it by a more
straightforward and honest means."
</P>
<P>
She maintained that the inquiry motions were "political plot"
designed to prevent her from becoming the rotating prime minister
in 1997 for two years in accordance with the coalition protocol
reached between her DYP and another center-right party, the
Motherland Party (ANAP).
</P>
<P>
But the RP leader Necmettin Erbakan, told local reporters after
the assembly that they had no intention to do that other than
fulfilling their "constitutional duty."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister and ANAP leader Mesut Yilmaz, whose deputies
voted for the inquiry motion, refused to make any comment on the
result.
</P>
<P>
A parliament committee will be set up for the investigation
and prepare a conclusion report in two months. The assembly then
will debate and vote for whether or not to send Ciller to the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
According to Turkish law, a person who faces trail in the
Supreme Court cannot be assigned as prime minister.

ATHENS, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Greece today offered assistance

A Hellenic air force c-130 cargo plane carrying eight navy

Fourteen Albanian students and their teacher drowned after
their overloaded boat sank in the lake, on the border between

<HEADLINE> NATO Chief to Visit Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana
will pay an official visit to Turkey at the end of this month,
the Anatolia news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Solana is expected to concentrate on the disputes between the
two NATO members, Turkey and Greece, during his stay in Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Tensions between the two countries mounted in late January when
Turkish journalists flew to the disputed islet of Imia (or Kardak
as the Turks call it) by helicopter, took down the Greek flag and
raised their own national flag.
</P>
<P>
Imia, which is claimed by both countries, is about 11 nautical
miles from the Greek island of Kalimnos and less than four miles
off the Turkish coast.
</P>
<P>
It is anticipated that the NATO chief will discuss confidence
building measures in the Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
Ankara recently proposed unarmed flying over the Aegean Sea of
each country's Air Force planes for a period of several months.
</P>
<P>
But no positive reply coming from the Greek side has prevented
such a measure from being carried out.
</P>
<P>
However, Greek sources in Ankara stated that Greek Prime
Minister Costas Simitis is a realistic politician and sooner or
later he would favor these confidence building measures.

said here today that Chinese President Jiang Zemin's current
visit to Kenya confirms the close and special friendship between
Kenya and China.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a state banquet in honor of Jiang, Moi welcomed
Jiang to begin this "historic visit" to Africa in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
As developing countries, he said, Kenya and China share
identical perceptions and views on international issues. He added
that he hopes the visit will provide the two countries with an
opportunity to explore new areas of common concern that will
strengthen their partnership in the international arena and in
substantive bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In his return speech, Jiang, who is on a six-country visit in
Africa, said the Chinese and Kenyan peoples have enjoyed a
time-honored traditional friendship.
</P>
<P>
"My delegation and I have come to Kenya to make it clear to
your government and people that the Chinese government and people
cherish the friendly relations and cooperation between the two
countries and stand ready to enhance bilateral cooperation in
international affairs, explore and open up new areas and new ways
of mutually-beneficial cooperation," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
President Moi, who last visited China in 1994, also gave
tribute to the Chinese people and Jiang himself for "taking bold
steps which have brought about spectacular advances in economic
and social development."
</P>
<P>
Moi extended congratulations to China for successfully hosting
the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women last year.
</P>
<P>
Also, he noted that China, as a member of the UN Security
Council, can play a useful role in the search for a comprehensive
solution to regional problems in order to consolidate security
and stability.
</P>
<P>
The president went on, "We look forward to continued
consultations on South-South cooperation and on other matters of
concern to us in the international forum."
</P>
<P>
Jiang, in his speech, pointed out the the changes in the
international arena have presented Africa with both new
challenges and opportunities.
</P>
<P>
He said Africa has already become an important force in the
international political arena and "We are convinced that the
people of Africa who were able to smash the shackles of
colonialism will be able to build a brilliant future for their
own nations."

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Two Canadian banks are set to launch
their personal computer banking systems that will let clients do
much of their banking at home.
</P>
<P>
Canada Trust is expected to unveil its new product, which will
be available nationally, as early as today.
</P>
<P>
Within days, Toronto Dominion Bank expects to show off its PC
offering, rolling it out across the country on a region-by-region
basis, today's Financial Post newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
PC banking will allow customers to connect their home computers
with a bank over secure direct telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
They will be able to pay bills, transfer funds and get account
updates, while displaying information on the computer screen and
manipulating it to do analysis and financial planning, according
to the paper.
</P>
<P>
At present, most banks in Canada have extensive phone banking
facilities, through which transactions are performed using
telephones.
</P>
<P>
PC banking has many more analytical and planning tools, and
allows electronic mail communication with bank staff.
</P>
<P>
The only major financial institution in Canada to have a PC
banking system already up and running is Vancouver City Savings
Credit Union.
</P>
<P>
Other Canadian banks, such as Bank of Nova Scotia, Royal Bank
of Canada and Bank of Montreal, are expected to offer PC banking
services at the end of this year or early next year, the paper
said.

<HEADLINE> President Clinton welcomes GOP Budget Plan for 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
welcomed the Republican budget proposal for 1997 today as a
"movement in the right direction" but admitted there still is
"significant differences".
</P>
<P>
The Republicans in U.S. Congress put forward on Wednesday a new
plan to balance the budget by the year 2002 and the Senate Budget
Committee began considering the plan today.
</P>
<P>
The GOP package included a scaled-back tax cut and smaller
reductions in social programs than they had pushed in last
winter's bitter standoff that forced two lengthy shutdowns of the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference today with Greek President Constantinos
Stephanopoulos, Clinton said he was encouraged by the GOP proposal
but that "we still have significant differences".
</P>
<P>
He criticized the proposed reductions in education and
environmental spending as still too large. He said the new plan
continued to put forward unacceptable reductions in Medicaid, the
health program for poor people.
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of things in there that I don't agree with,
but it is a movement in the right direction," the president told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The packages would trim taxes and pluck savings from Medicare,
Medicaid, welfare and a host of other domestic programs. And
though details were sparse, GOP aides said their plans would
reduce planned expenditures by 700 billion dollars over the next
six years. That will be about 100 billion more than President
Clinton wants to cut.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Congressional budgets are nonbinding guides that do not
require the president's signature and must be followed by bills
making actual changes in spending and taxes. But in spelling out
lawmakers' overall fiscal priorities, they achieve major political
significance, especially in a election year.

<HEADLINE> British Interest Rates Remain Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Kenneth Clarke, British Chancellor of
the Exchequer, and Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England,
held their monthly monetary meeting Wednesday and no cut in
interest rates was announced in the immediate aftermath of the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Speculation that Clarke would cut rates had increased over
recent weeks after the publication of economic data showing
sluggish GDP growth of 0.4 percent in the first quarter of the
year and a manufacturing sector on the brink of recession.
</P>
<P>
But the Bank of England is believed to have opposed any cut in
rates, pointing to data which shows consumer spending is
accelerating, raising the threat of higher inflation.
</P>
<P>
Clarke also made it clear that defeating inflation remains a
prime objective. Speaking on radio before his meeting with George,
he said: "I am determined to keep up a successful policy on
inflation."
</P>
<P>
But many economists believe that political pressure for a rate
cut, to help to stimulate the economy, may still grow ahead of the
general election to be held by May 1997.

WASHINGTON, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages
averaged 8.24 percent in U.S. this week, the highest in a year,
according to a national survey released today by the Federal Home
Loan Mortgage Corp.
</P>
<P>
The average is up from 7.99 percent last week and is the
highest since May 4, 1995, when rates averaged 8.27 percent.

The rates had dropped below 8 percent in the country and

But in recent weeks, they have risen into the upper 7 percent
range and hit 8.04 percent on April 11.

On one-year adjustable rate mortgages, lenders were asking an
average initial rate of 5.80 percent, up from 5.76 percent last
week.

<HEADLINE> Bank Chief Reiterates His Doubts upon EMU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Eddie George, the governor of the
Bank of England, Warned UK MPs Wednesday that a
politically-inspired rush to the European economic and monetary
union (EMU) could lead to economic disaster.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the powerful Treasury select committee, George
reiterated previously expressed reservations about the whole EMU
project, describing it as an "extremely ambitious" undertaking
which carried serious risks.
</P>
<P>
He said that the recent economic slowdown on the continent had
left him "more doubtful than a year ago" whether the conditions
would be in place for healthy monetary union in 1999, the current
planned starting date.
</P>
<P>
The governor pointed out that the high unemployment levels in
Europe, and the variation between countries, were key factors
threatening the viability of the single currency project.
</P>
<P>
It was "hugely important" for countries not only to achieve the
Maastricht convergence criteria in the run-up to a single currency
but to sustain convergence afterwards, he said.
</P>
<P>
George went on by saying that with European-wide interest rates
set in Frankfurt, conflicts could arise between nations at
different points in the economic cycle or with differing rates of
joblessness. The risks are that it would be difficult to get
agreement on a single monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
He added that there would be some dangers associated with
opting out but Britain could always decide to join at a later
date, while an immediate commitment to go in would be
irreversible.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv has
asked American citizens to avoid public transportation waiting at
bus stops, reported Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
The embassy travel advisory has issued a general warning
following a Federal court ruling to extradite Hamas political
leader Mousa Mohammed Abu Marzook from the U.S. to Israel.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government is anticipating anti-American violence as a
result of the ruling.
</P>
<P>
Hamas, an acronym for Islamic Resistance Movement, a radical
Palestinian group, was formed in late 1987 in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Kevin Duffy ruled in New York Wednesday
that Abu Marzook can be extradited to Israel, saying there is
reasonable cause to believe that he is connected with violence.
</P>
<P>
But Abu Marzook, 45, contended that he is the leader of the
Hamas political bureau and that he has no control over the
activities of the military wing. He has also denied involvement in
terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
A Hamas leader in Gaza condemned the decision as "criminal."
"This, as a minimum, can be described as criminal act, and it has
political and election dimensions for both (U.S. President Bill)
Clinton and (Prime Minister Shimon) Peres," said Sayyed Abu
Musameh.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat's adviser Babil
Abu Rdainah said the PA has always opposed to Abu Marzook's
extradition. "If he is extradited, he should be handed over to
the PA and not to Israel," he declared.

<HEADLINE> EU Consumes 4.7 Percent More Natural Gas in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, May 10 (Xinhua) -- European Union(EU) gross inland
consumption of natural gas last year rose considerably by 4.7
percent to around 300 million tons of oil equivalent(TOE).
</P>
<P>
This is showed by today's provisional data from EUROSTAT, the
Statistical Office of the European Communities in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
The reports said: "This increase of 14 million TOE represents a
level of growth well in excess of that observed over the last few
years."
</P>
<P>
Today's figures suggested that natural gas recorded the highest
increase of all energy sources in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The rise seems due to greater penetration by natural gas of the
industrial and domestic sectors and its increasing use in
conventional thermal power stations, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Spain recorded a 21 percent rise, although its share of total
EU consumption is less than three percent.
</P>
<P>
Sweden's consumption was up by over a quarter but still forms a
tiny 0.3 percent of all EU consumption.
</P>
<P>
More significant was Italy's 9.9 percent increase, it consumes
almost 17 percent of the EU.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Budget Secretary Salvador
Enriquez today urged Congress to pass the Comprehensive Tax Reform
Program to support the government's 1997 socio-economic
development plan.
</P>
<P>
He said the ongoing evaluation of budget proposals for 1997 of
government departments and agencies would only be a futile
exercise unless the tax measure is enacted by Congress.
</P>
<P>
He warned that without the additional revenues, the government
would have difficulty in drawing up a national budget for the next
year.
</P>
<P>
"Right now the Department of Budget and Management is
experiencing difficulties deciding on department proposals that
should be supported in the 1997 budget that President (Fidel)
Ramos will propose to Congress," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Ramos is expected to formally propose the 1997 national budget
of 470.2 billion pesos (18.08 billion US dollars) in his State of
the Nation address when Congress reopens its session in July.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Exports to Hong Kong Go up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's exports to Hong Kong
in the last 10 months rose 43 percent over the corresponding
period a year ago, the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) said
today.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the country's traditional export items like yarn
and fabrics, non-traditional exports like fish and fish
preparation, fresh fruit, leather, precious and semi-precious
stones also registered substantial increases.
</P>
<P>
Rising from its previous fifth position, Hong Kong now ranks as
the second most important destination for Pakistan's exports after
the United States, informed sources were quoted as saying by the
APP.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has set the target for its exports to Hong Kong at 700
million US dollars for the current financial year from July 1995
to June 1996.
</P>
<P>
The two-way trade between Pakistan and Hong Kong is expected to
reach 800 million dollars in this fiscal year with the balance of
trade titled to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's interaction with a large number of multinational
companies located in Hong Kong contributes more than one billion
dollars of exports to the US and Europe that are not reflected in
the export figures of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are now actively negotiating direct air
connections between Pakistan and Hong Kong, establishment of a
Pakistan-Hong Kong businessmen council and single-country
exhibitions for 1997, said the APP.

<HEADLINE> UN Police Attacked By Bosnian Serbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Angry Bosnian Serbs Thursday
attacked a UN international patrol car escorting some 60 Muslim
refugees on a visit to their family graves near Doboj, northern
Bosnia, a UN spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
This was apparently the first attack on the UN-organized
International Police Task Force (IPTF) since it came to Bosnia to
carry out the Dayton peace agreement signed last December.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations considers this incident an extremely
serious one" and will protest to the Serb authorities, IPTF
spokesman Alexander Ivanko, said at the daily briefing here. No
one was seriously injuried in the incident.
</P>
<P>
According IPTF account cited by Ivanko, the incident occurred
Thursday morning when some 60 Muslims on their way to the village
of Donje Rjecica was blocked by 50 Serb civilians.
</P>
<P>
The Serbs attacked the patrol car, damaging the roof by jumping
on it and smashing the windscreen, while two IPTF members were
forced to lock themselves inside the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
The UN police also witnessed a group of reporters being
threatened and assaulted, with their films confiscated and cameras
destroyed, Ivanko said.
</P>
<P>
The Serb mobs also threatened those present with sniper fires
from set positions and surrounding hills, he said.
</P>
<P>
When the UN policemen called for help from NATO-led
Implementation Force (IFOR), it took more than one hour for the
first IFOR vehicle to arrive on the scene. The incident ended in
two hours when Muslims were forced to cancel the visit later,
Ivanko said.
</P>
<P>
Describing it a behavior of "highly unprofessional", the UN
spokesman said that approximately 20 Serb policemen including the
deputy police chief of Doboj were present, but they failed to
restrain the crowd.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that this visit was previously agreed by the
Serb authorities and the Serb police did intervene in the incident.
</P>
<P>
This was the lastest of the incidents in which the three former
warring factions tried to prevent refugees of other ethnic groups
from returning.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese President Receives Message from Iranian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi
received here today a message from his Iranian counterpart
Hashemi Rafsanjani, which was conveyed to the Beirut Presidential
Palace by Iranian Housing Minister Abbas Akhundi.
</P>
<P>
At the end of his meeting with the Lebanese president, the
Iranian minister, who arrived here thursday on an official visit,
announced that the message expressed Iran's position of "standing
on the side of Lebanon's government and people in all difficult
circumstances."
</P>
<P>
He said that the principal aim of his visit was the "necessary
coordination on the Iranian assistances for reconstructing what
was ruined by Israel" in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel launched its air, naval and artillery attacks against
south Lebanon last month, leaving 160 people killed and some 400
wounded, most of them civilians. The 17-day Israeli bombardment
caused severe destruction.
</P>
<P>
Akhundi said that he would left behind him Mohammed Kazem
Khansari, director of the Middle East and Northern Africa
Department in the Iranian Foreign Ministry, to stay in Lebanon in
order to go on the procedures regarding the assistances which
Iran would provide for Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
At the end of his talks with Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri earlier today, the Iranian minister stressed his country's
"readiness to offer any help which Lebanon demands in
reconstructing the infrastructures damaged by Israel" in the
recent Israeli aggressions in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that he and the Lebanese prime minister had
agreed to the revival of the Iranian-Lebanese bilateral
cooperation committee "as soon as possible."

NEW DELHI, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government, led by
Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao, resigned today in view of the
elections results which showed that the ruling Congress Party was
heading for its worst ever performance in a general election.
</P>
<P>
According to the Press Trust of India, Rao tendered resignation
of his Council of Ministers to President Shankar Dayal Sharma this
evening and recommended the dissolution of the 10th Lok Sabha
(lower house of parliament).
</P>
<P>
Rao called on the president at his residence here soon after a
cabinet meeting and conveyed the recommendation of his cabinet on
the dissolution of the 10th Lok Sabha.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued by the Presidential House said the
president has accepted the resignation and asked Rao to continue
in office till alternative arrangements were made.
</P>
<P>
The resignation of the government came when the counting of
votes showed that none of the political parties in the country
could win a working majority in the current elections for 11th Lok
Sabha, making a hung parliament inevitable. The move will pave
the way for the formation of a new government.

<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Agriculture has
ordered a ban on the import of fruit from an epidemic-stricken
area in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has also called on animal and plants quarantine
departments at all Chinese ports to strengthen the quarantine
checks of imported fruits and goods brought in by passengers.
</P>
<P>
Auckland on New Zealand's north island is reported to be
experiencing an outbreak of Mediterranean fruit fly pest. Several
countries and districts have already taken measures to control the
import of fruits from there.
</P>
<P>
The Mediterranean fruit fly, known as "killer of fruits," is
destructive to fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
Yao Wenguo, deputy director of the Animals and Plants
Quarantine Bureau under the China's Ministry, said that the fly
has long been an insect subject to quarantine in the country.
</P>
<P>
China has uncovered the "killer of fruits" four times, three of
which were seized in the fruits and vegetables carried by
international tourists, Yao said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, China imports apples, pears, citrus fruits, grapes
and other fruits worth hundreds of thousands of NZ dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
Since May 8, China has banned imports of fruit from the NZ's
north island.
</P>

MACAO, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Macao government has enacted a
new set of regulations from May 1 governing the running of hotels
in Macao, officials announced.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations adjust the star level of hotels and make

facilities, room heights and per capita using space, among others.
</P>
<P>
The previous star-level hotels of five ranges are adjusted to
four, with the one-star rank canceled. Those leasing apartments
previously marked with a four-star rank system will be reduced to
a two-star system, with the four-star apartments turning to hotels
 and the one-star canceled.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the new regulations set star level for bars and
demand that bar-owners should make standard for customer's
minimum expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Those who fail regular checks by the government will be liable
to reduction to a lower rank.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that hotels and similar businesses will have six
 months as the transitional period, and after that they must abide
 by the new regulations aiming at standard management of hotels.
</P>

Macao now has more than 40 star-rank hotels, with the number of
 guest rooms topping 10,000.
</P>

Tourism is one of the leading sources of income for the Macao
government. Some eight million travelers visited Macao last

at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Briefing Intertanko members on Articles 124 to 127 of the Basic

<HEADLINE> World Bank Pledges Support for East Asia's Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank promised here
today that it would continue to play a supportive role in the
future development of East Asia, as countries in this region are
facing "formidable challenges" in sustaining their rapid growth.
</P>
<P>
"The World Bank has been involved in a supportive role at every
stage. I want to ensure that we continue this role," President of
the World Bank James D. Wolfensohn said at a public lecture.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn, who assumed the presidency of the World Bank nearly
a year ago, is on a tour of several East Asian countries,
including Vietnam, Singapore and Indonesia, to see at first hand
the work of the World Bank in the region and also to meet with
government leaders.
</P>
<P>
He said that despite the remarkable successes, East Asian
economies are confronted with formidable challenges in sustaining
their development in the face of large-scale changes taking place
throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
Highlighting five aspects of the challenges facing the region,
Wolfensohn noted that East Asian economies are principal
beneficiaries of the massive increase underway in international
private investment.
</P>
<P>
Of the roughly 170 billion US dollars in private capital flows
to all developing economies last year, nearly 60 percent, or 100
billion US dollars, went to East Asia and brought significant
benefits, he said.
</P>
<P>
But as the Mexico crisis demonstrated last year, recipient
countries must strengthen their capacity to manage effectively the
more volatile components of these flows, he warned.
</P>
<P>
The other aspects of the challenges, he said, are a major
increase in regional integration into the world trading system, a
transition from predominantly rural to increasingly urban
societies, an ongoing social transition and a transition from
planned to market economies.
</P>
<P>
To meet these challenges, "a deepened relationship" could
benefit both the countries of the East Asian region and the World
Bank, said Wolfensohn.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized several areas where partnership would be
"particularly beneficial."
</P>
<P>
The first is the need for more collaboration in analyzing
development experience and the second is that East Asia and the
World Bank should continue their joint attack on poverty and human
suffering, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, East Asian economies and the World Bank can work
together in developing infrastructure and human resources,
fostering well-functioning financial systems, sharing information,
providing adequate social insurance and protecting the
environment, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto today ruled out the possibility of an early dissolution
of the House of Representatives for a snap election.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto said he is so preoccupied with a heap of urgent
problems that he cannot give any serious consideration to the
dissolution of the lower house.
</P>
<P>
The imminent task of his tripartite coalition government is to
put the budding economic recovery firmly on track, said the prime
minister at a nationally televised press conference following the
passage of the fiscal 1996 budget at the Diet.
</P>
<P>
Although the economy is gradually picking up, the jobless rate
is still high and small and medium-sized companies are facing
unfavorable business conditions, Hashimoto said.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated that he wants to maintain the current
framework of the ruling coalition, which is composed of his
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the Social Democratic Party and
New Party Sakigake.
</P>
<P>
He denied speculation over any possible LDP alliance with the
leading opposition Shinshinto (New Frontier) party.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Order Restored in HK Detention Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Some 2,000 police and
correctional services officers of Hong Kong have finally restored
order inside the Whitehead Detention Center where a violent
incident broke out early this morning.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese Migrants (VMs) set fire on the center and staged a
sitting protest at about 4:15 a.m., and some 200 of them escaped
the center. So far only 70 of the escapees have been recaptured.
</P>
<P>
During the incident many detention huts and several buildings
in the vicinity were burned down. A total of 53 vehicles were
either burned or damaged. In addition, 43 police, correctional and
fire services officers as well as three VMs were injured.
</P>
<P>
To keep the situation under control, the police fired about
1,800 tear-gas canisters at the detention center, while firemen
used 12 jets and two helicopters to put out the fire at 3:29 p.m.
</P>
<P>
Following the incident, 928 VMs have been transferred from the
troubled center to High Island Detention Center. However, some 400
VMs still remained on the rooftops of the detention huts.
</P>
<P>
The police authorities have called on local residents to report
on the escapees. Search efforts for the runaway VMs have seriously
hampered traffic on some of Hong Kong's major roads.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Junsheng, vice director of Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong
Branch, said today that it is irresponsible for the British
government to receive Vietnamese migrants in Hong Kong while
failing to properly handle them for so many years.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the British government will be able
to deal with this problem in all sincerity and with a sense of
responsibility in the days before mid-1997 when China resumes the
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Seminar On Asian Energy Development in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Dynamic Asian economies are
facing the challenge of sustainable energy development, which has
become the theme of an international symposium here over the past
two days.
</P>
<P>
As Guy F. Caruso, director of the Office of Non-member
Countries of the International Energy Agency (IEA) described in
his keynote paper presented at the meeting, sustainable energy
development means energy growth that is achieved in an
environmentally-sound way, and that promotes economic growth
without threatening energy supply and security.
</P>
<P>
He put the concept in short as "the three Es" -- economic
growth, energy security and environment. The IEA official said
that the issue is more challenging for Asia where economic growth
is so rapid.
</P>
<P>
The two-day seminar addressed a wide range of topics from
promotion of energy efficiency to financing of energy projects,
and technology transfer.
</P>
<P>
Lack of funds and technology was acknowledged as the main
restraint for Asia's developing economies to implement sustainable
energy policies. Participants believed that developing economies
can learn a lot from the experiences of developed countries, who
have gone through successes and failures over the past decades.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 energy experts, officials from Asian-Pacific
countries and regions as well as international and regional
organizations attended the seminar, organized by the Hong Kong
Institution of Engineers.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Madame Han Suyin, a 79-year-old
British Writer, has been conferred with the title of "Friendship
Envoy" in Beijing today by the Chinese People's Association
for Friendship With Foreign Countries (CPAFFC).
</P>
<P>
Lei Jieqiong, vice-chairperson of the Chinese National People's
Congress Standing Committee, Zheng Bijian, deputy head of the
Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist
Party of China and CPAFFC President Qi Huaiyuan presented warm
speeches at the ceremony, praising Han Suyin for her remarkable
contributions to promoting cultural and scientific exchanges
between China and other nations.
</P>
<P>
Han has visited China almost every year since 1956. She has now
completed more than 40 books, most of them depicting the Chinese
revolution process and the construction achievements of New
China. In 1994, she was given the "Second International Literature
Prize for Understanding and Friendship" by the China Literature
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1960s Han has delivered more than 2,000 lectures in
European and American countries, through which she described
China's construction achievements to the West by citing lively and
concrete facts.
</P>
<P>
In 1986 she established the "Han Suyin Fund for Scientific
Exchanges between China and the West", which has so far sponsored
more than 20 Chinese scholars to study abroad, and foreign
scholars to lecture in China.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Han Suyin established "Rainbow Prize" and "Han
Suyin Young Translators Prize" to introduce Chinese literature
works to other nations, and to encourage the translation of foreign
literature works into Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Han's husband Vincent Ruthnaswamy was conferred with the title
of "Friendship Envoy" in 1990. Today's ceremony has made them the
first couple to be both awarded the distinguished honor.
</P>
<P>
Han said at the ceremony that she would continue to work for
cultural exchange between China and other countries.

<P>
The propsoed joint venture will acquire all the existing
assets of the Eritrea's national soft drinks factory in Asmara
and will invest some 8 million Dollars over the next 12 months

SHENZHEN, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen and Hong Kong have held a

the two cities.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, organized by the Shenzhen Branch of the People's
Bank of China, the country's central bank, was aimed at finding
ways of letting commercial instruments sent from one city to be
handled the day they are received in the other.
</P>
<P>
More than 210,000 transactions, involving capital of 103
billion yuan, has been conducted between the two cites so far this
year, according to statistics released by five banks in Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 7,000 enterprises in Shenzhen are wholly or partially
funded by Hong Kong entrepreneurs, and about 80 percent of
Shenzhen's imports and exports, valued at billions of US dollars,
have been transhipped through Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
But many intermediary links and the long turnover period have
hampered further economic and trade integration between the two
cities.
</P>
<P>
It is the first such seminar that financiers in Shenzhen and
Hong Kong have taken part in to discuss still deeper financial
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
More than ten representatives from the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority, Hong Kong Inter-bank Clearance Co.Ltd, Nangyang

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official Urges Further Crackdown on Major Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official today
called for a nationwide campaign against major crime to be stepped
up to maintain social stability.
</P>
<P>
Ren Jianxin, member of the Secretariat of the Chinese Communist
Party's (CPC) Central Committee and Secretary of the Political
Science and Law Committee under the CPC Central Committee, urged
officials to attach greater importance to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
Ren, also Director of the Central Committee for Comprehensive
Management of Public Security, made the call at the 18th plenary
session of the committee in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
The crackdown Ren talked about was launched by the Chinese
central authorities on April 28, focusing on robbery and theft and
crimes that targeted financial institutions and urban residential
areas. The call urged improvements in social order in problem
areas, smashing drug-trafficking and prostitution, and
confiscating illegal firearms and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
Ren said that during the past 12 days, a batch of major cases
have been cracked, and many mafia-style criminals apprehended.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a number of long term criminals on the run from
police have been netted, and a number of major criminals have been
punished under the law, he said.
</P>
<P>
The campaign has been welcomed by people from all walks of
life, Ren noted, adding that the crackdown has only just begun and
will be followed by more action.
</P>
<P>
"Sorting out the problem of social security and public safety
has a major bearing on the nation's reform, development and
stability. We must be fully aware of the special importance of the
crackdown," he said.
</P>
<P>
He asked departments in the field of political science and law
to continue to push forward the drive with concerted efforts and
work hard for substantial successes in the crackdown.
</P>
<P>
The departments should also carry out the campaign under the
unified leadership of party committees and governments at various
levels, with assistance from other departments and organizations,
Ren added.
</P>
<P>
He accused some officials of lacking sufficient consciousness
about the importance of the crackdown, and claimed they had not
taken sufficient, prompt action so far.
</P>
<P>
"Such a situation cannot be tolerated and should be changed at
once, or the officials will be held responsible," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ren also stressed that the campaign has provided a favorable
condition for implementing other measures in comprehensive
management of public security, and all departments and localities
should take advantage of this to improve public order.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Macao Tourism Targets Asia Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Macao's tourism industry has enhanced
 its publicity work in east and southeast Asia and is expected to
grow by 10 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
According to officials with the Tourism Department of the Macao
 Government, the leading tourism markets to be developed this year
 will include China's mainland, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan,
Singapore and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The second level market will cover Europe, the United States
and Canada.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the targeted markets were chosen because they
have direct air links with Macao.
</P>
<P>
"Gambling, which makes Macao well known, is most attractive to
people in Asia," said an official. "Now they have an easier way to
 come via the international airport."
</P>
<P>
The tourism department will establish representative offices in
 those areas to introduce Macao to local people and travel
agencies.
</P>
<P>
Officials said they will also keep contact with travel agencies
 and hotels in those regions, invite tourism officials of those
regions or countries to visit Macao, and attend regional tourism
fairs.
</P>
<P>
A leading source of income for the Macao Government, the
tourism industry has been growing fast over the past decade. About
 eight million people visited Macao last year.
</P>
<P>
Most of the travelers came from Hong Kong, China's mainland,
Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, southeast Asia, Europe and north
America.
</P>
<P>
"We have re-organized the tourism department so that we could
concentrate our efforts to cultivate the tourism market," said an
official with the tourism department. "We will increase investment
 in the publicity work to attract more visitors."
</P>
<P>
The department plans to develop more tourism attractions in
Macao. Apart from the existing scenic spots, grand prix and
dragon-boat contests, several specialized museums and parks have
also been built.
</P>
<P>
Experts say Macao's tourism industry is expected to grow by 10
percent this year, but the pace will be lower than the 15 percent
previously projected following the opening of the Macao
international airport last November.

<HEADLINE> India's BJP to Stake Claim to Forming Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 10 (Xinhua) -- India's main opposition Bharatiya
Janata Party (BJP) today decided to stake a claim to forming its
government while keeping open the options of either having the BJP
government with outside support or forming a coalition with its
allies.
</P>
<P>
According to the Press Trust of India, the party took the
"unanimous decision" at a joint meeting of its parliamentary board
and major office bearers.
</P>
<P>
BJP President L.K. Advani presided over the meeting attended by
most of the senior party leaders, including its prime ministerial
candidate Atal Behari Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
BJP General Secretary Pramod Mahajan told reporters that
regional parties across the country made "very positive" responses
to the BJP's move to seek their support in forming the government.
</P>
<P>
However, he declined to identify the possible allies.
</P>
<P>
But the party has yet to reach a stage where it could decide
whether to form a BJP government with outside support or go for a
coalition with its allies, he said.
</P>
<P>
The joint meeting authorized Advani and Vajpayee to make a
final decision on the choice of allies.
</P>
<P>
The BJP leadership made the decision in view of the fact that
the party is emerging as the single largest party in the current
general elections with the counting of votes going on.
</P>
<P>
Winning 101 of the 365 seats declared, the BJP established
leads in more constituencies than the ruling Congress Party in
Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh.
</P>
<P>
The Congress Party is leading the list with 106 seats.

<P>
NEW DELHI, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Indian cabinet met this
evening and decided to recommend to President Shankar Dayal Sharma
to dissolve the 10th Lok Sabha (lower house of parliament), the
Press Trust of India (PTI) said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao presided over the cabinet
meeting that lasted 35 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The full council of ministers met later and decided that the
prime minister should submit his resignation and that of the
council.
</P>
<P>
Rao is expected to meet the president late in the evening and
tender his resignation, said the PTI.
</P>
<P>
A resolution adopted by the cabinet praised Rao for his
services in laying a strong economic foundation for India.
</P>
<P>
Vote counting results and trends for the remaining seats
suggested that the ruling Congress Party suffered massive losses
in the general elections and that a hung parliament looks to be

<HEADLINE> Major Bangladeshi Party Puts out Election Manifesto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's former largest
opposition party, the Awami (People's) League (AL), today
announced its election manifesto for the country's parliamentary
elections scheduled for June 12.
</P>
<P>
The AL said in the manifesto that it "is determined to restore
peace and stability in the country along with ensuring
development, human rights and the rule of law."
</P>
<P>
Announcing the manifesto, AL chief Sheikh Hasina said if voted
to power, her party would establish the rule of law and ensure
accountability and transparency of the administration in the great
interest of the nation.
</P>
<P>
"Necessary laws will be enacted for ascertaining appointment
and service conditions of the employees of the republic under
constitutional provisions to build up an efficient and disciplined
administrative system in the country," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The army, navy, airforce and the Bangladesh rifles will be
made well-equipped befitting to the time to help them carry out
their respective responsibilities," Hasina added.
</P>
<P>
On the country's foreign policy, the AL chief said her party
would administer foreign affairs in the light of "friendship to
all, malice to none."
</P>
<P>
Hasina also promised to strengthen regional cooperation by
maintaining good and cordial relations with neighboring countries.
 But she reiterated that the 1972 Bangladesh-India Friendship
Treaty would not be renewed when it expires next year.
</P>
<P>
She said the treaty "was of special importance in 1972 for
maintaining security and upholding independence and sovereignty of
the new-born Bangladesh."

<P>
TOKYO, April 10 (Xinhua) -- European soccer officials suggested
that Japan and South Korea co-host the 2002 World Cup to defuse an
intense competition between the two countries over the event, a
newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lennart Johansson, president of European soccer ruling body
UEFA, reiterated his proposal in a telephone interview Thursday,
The Asahi Evening News said.
</P>
<P>
Johansson first suggested in April that Japan and South Korea
share the event.
</P>
<P>
The Asahi Evening News quoted Johansson as saying that a change
in soccer statutes "can be easily done in a congress" and that "we
can arrange it so that co-hosting is possible."
</P>
<P>
"This is more than a bid for the World Cup," Johansson said.
"This is a fight between two countries and it could have a
political impact. We would feel terrible if the relations between
the countries were damaged because of this."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Manila to Punish Child Abusers Sternly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
inflict severe punishment on child abusers, including death
penalty for those who engage in sexual acts with minors.
</P>
<P>
The move came after an Olangapo city court sentenced an
Australian citizen eight to 17 years imprisonment for the sexual
abuse of a 12-year-old girl last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This was the first conviction under the 1992 Special Protection
for Children Act.
</P>
<P>
Over 260 prosecutions had been made against child abusers in
the country in the past decade but none had led to a conviction.
</P>
<P>
The case has drawn a telling reminder from the Social Welfare
Department, the need to speed up the prosecution of 22 other cases
against child abusers.
</P>
<P>
Social Welfare Secretary Lina Laigo said, "I would like to
appeal to the prosecutors and judges to speed up the process for
the sake of our children."
</P>
<P>
"The conviction would serve as a strong deterrent to foreigners
who continue to prey our innocent children," she added.
</P>
<P>
Since March this year, 2,277 cases of child abuse and
exploitation have been reported to and handled by the Social
Welfare Department.
</P>
<P>
Of this number, 45 percent (1,015) are rape victims, 27 percent
(616) are incest victims and eight percent (175) are prostitution
victims.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives Wednesday unanimously approved on
second reading a bill declaring child prostitution a heinous
crime.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, pimps and other persons involved in the sex
trafficking of children will be given stiff punishment, including
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
According to an estimate of the Bangkok-based End Child
Prostitution in Asian Tourism Pressure Group, the Philippines has
some 300,000 children working as prostitutes.

<HEADLINE> China to Open Wider to Outside World: Senior Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 10 (Xinhua) -- China will open wider to the outside
world to adapt itself to the development of the world economy, a
senior Chinese official said here today.
</P>
<P>
"To build a socialist market economy and to bring it in line
with the international norms, we will continue to deepen the
reform on our economic system and foreign trade regime," Li
Guohua, China's deputy foreign trade minister, said at the
three-day seventh annual conference of the Asia Society of the
United States which started here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We firmly believe that reform and opening-up is a must for
economic development and that only by maintaining social and
political stability, can we make reform and opening-up possible,"
Li pointed out.
</P>
<P>
She said that China will also modify irregular policies to
increase their unity and transparency.
</P>
<P>
As a member of the Asian family, she noted, China will not only
promote its own economic development, but also contribute to the
development of regional and global economy.
</P>
<P>
China will actively participate in regional economic
cooperation with other Asian countries to achieve common stability
and prosperity in Asia, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on intellectual property rights (IPR) protection, the
vice-minister said that China, which has strengthened its
legislation, law enforcement and publicity work on IPR protection,
has scored remarkable achievements.
</P>
<P>
She added that the Chinese government will further improve its
legislative system and law enforcement regime on IPR protection,
and unswervingly crack down on illegal activities of IPR
infringements.
</P>
<P>
The conference, attended by representatives from the U.S. and
nine Asian countries and regions, is addressing the Asian region's
recently-acquired dominance in the world economy and South Korea's
globalization plans and prospects.
</P>
<P>
The Asia Society, established in 1956, is the leading
U.S. institution dedicated to fostering public understanding of
Asia and communication between Americans and the peoples of Asia
and the Pacific.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Steps up Anti-Drug Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Singapore is stepping up its
efforts to clamp down on drug abuse as the Central Narcotics
Bureau (CNB) issued a warning today to licensees of night clubs,
lounges and discos against ongoing illegal drug activities.
</P>
<P>
CNB Director Sim Poh Heng said that owners of these outlets
could no longer plead ignorance of such activities following
today's warning.
</P>
<P>
Local television said senior CNB and police officials met 72
licensees today and warned them against drug pushing and drug
taking activities among young people gathering in large numbers.
</P>
<P>
Sim said that since the beginning of last year, the CNB has
received many public complaints about drug abuse at these places,
where illicit drug activities, like cannabis smoking and ecstasy
abuse, were found to be taking place.
</P>
<P>
CNB Deputy Director Masbollah Fazal told a press conference
that the CNB seized 230 grams of heroin in an island-wide
operation Thursday and rounded up 127 drug pushers and addicts, 91
of whom had positive urine results.
</P>
<P>
Masbollah added that all the addicts were sent to Drug
Rehabilitation Centers (DRCs) and five of them would be charged in
court for drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Community Development of Singapore said last
year that the number of addicts in the DRCs went up from 4,652 in
1987 to 8,130 in 1993, an increase of almost 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
The majority, or 84 percent of the addicts were repeat cases
who had been admitted to the DRCs for two or more times, said the
ministry.

<HEADLINE> Shengli Wins Bid for Oil Development in Xinjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JI'NAN, May 10 (Xinhua) -- State-owned Shengli Oilfield,
China's second largest petroleum producer, has won oil exploration
and development rights in a new oilfield thousands of kilometers
from its home base.
</P>
<P>
Staff from the administration have now been sent to Hotan
Prefecture in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in northwest
China to start exploratory work on the new field.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that the oilfield administration, located
in east China's Shandong Province, has extended its business to
other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Current output of the existing 37,000-sq-km oilfield tops 30
million tons annually. Besides tapping the potential in its older
blocks, the oilfield management has been seeking new areas to
explore and develop.
</P>
<P>
Western parts of China, especially Xinjiang, are an area of
great potential for the country's oil industry development.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC)
offered five blocks in Xinjiang to large home-based oilfield
operators to compete through bidding.
</P>
<P>
Winners of the bidding were required to explore oil with their
own funding, technology and personnel. When new oilfields are
discovered, extraction rights go to the winners, who obtain
management and exploration rights, oil output and profits.
</P>
<P>
After heated competition in the bidding, the Shengli oilfield
won a major oilfield block in Hotan - larger than the
administration's current blocks added together. Initial estimates
of oil reserves in Hotan put the level at 900 million tons.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Hung Parliament Appears Inevitable in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 10 (Xinhua) -- None of India's political parties
looks able to muster a majority in the parliamentary elections, as
is indicated by the bulk of results declared so far and the trends
for the rest, as the counting of votes entered the third day
today.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Congress Party is still ahead of others, according
to the latest results available for 365 of the 537 seats of the
Lok Sabha (lower house of parliament) contested in the first three
phases of polling of the general elections.
</P>
<P>
The Congress Party bagged 106 seats, followed by the Bharatiya
Janata Party (BJP) 101, the Janata Dal 29 and others 129.
</P>
<P>
However, the results and the trends for the remaining seats
showed that the Congress Party was suffering unprecedented losses
in both the Lok Sabha and the assembly elections.
</P>
<P>
It experienced its worst setbacks in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and
Madhya Pradesh. In Karnakatak, where the party had won 23 of the
28 seats in the last elections, it secured only four seats this
time finishing a poor third.
</P>
<P>
In Tamil Nadu, the opposition is heading toward a landslide
victory by garnering all the 20 seats declared.  In 1991, the
Congress Party and its ally the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra
Kazhagam (AIADMK) collected all the 39 Lok Sabha seats in the
state.
</P>
<P>
An earlier analysis of 136 Lok Sabha seats, of which results
were then available, suggested that the Congress Party lost more
than one seat it had held for every seat it won this time.
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of the Congress Party's massive losses, the
major opposition BJP and the National Front-Left Front (NF-LF)
Combine continued to gain and make inroads into the ruling party's
erstwhile strongholds.
</P>
<P>
While the BJP has scored its major gains in Maharashtra with
its ally the Shive Sena and in Madhya Pradesh, the Janata Dal -- a
main component of the NF-LF Combine -- is doing well in Karnataka
and its stronghold Bihar.
</P>
<P>
The Left Front, including the Communist Party of India
(Marxist) and the Communist Party of India, and their partners are
also doing well in West Bengal and Kerala.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an anti-establishment mood prevailed in the assembly
elections in six states that were held simultaneously with the
general polls.
</P>
<P>
Ruling parties in five states -- Haryana, Assam, Tamil Nadu,
Kerala and Pondicherry -- have lost in the race, with the ruling
Left Front alone set to retain power in West Bengal.
</P>
<P>
The Congress Party was the ruling party in Haryana, Assam,
Kerala and Pondicherry.
</P>
<P>
As the prospect of a hung parliament looms large, political
parties, especially the BJP and NF-LF Combine, have initiated a
series of contacts and meetings to explore the possibility of
forming a new government.
</P>
<P>
The BJP Parliamentary Board and its central office bearers met
here today to formulate the strategy to stake its claim to the
formation of government and identify possible allies in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
Senior leaders of the Janata Dal also met here this morning to
discuss the party's post-poll strategy.  The party has vowed to
prevent at any cost the BJP from forming the new government.
</P>
<P>
The Congress Party, which appears to have adopted a policy of
wait-and-watch, has also stated that it will have no truck with
the BJP to form a coalition government.

<P>
Beijing, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Industrial and Commercial Bank
of China (ICBC), the largest State bank in the country, announced
here today that the balance of its savings deposits by urban
residents had topped 1,000 billion yuan to reach 1,020.5 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
"The substantial increase in savings deposits has not only
enhanced the bank's own capital strength, but also boosted the
withdrawal of currency, thus playing an important role in helping
curb price rises," said an official of the bank.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, while focusing on taking deposits,
the bank has also made great efforts to develop a variety of
intermediary and agent services, with the aim of expanding its
business scope and providing multiple financial services to

<HEADLINE> Imported Waste Case under Investigation (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese authorities are about
to launch a detailed investigation to check out how nearly 640
tons of garbage was imported into China from the United States.
</P>
<P>
The investigation will be carried out jointly by nine
government departments, including the State Bureau for
Environmental Protection, the Ministry of Public Security, the
National Administration of Industry and Commerce, and the National
Administration of Customs.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made today at a joint meeting of the nine
government departments.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Beijing Municipal People's Government and
Qingdao City People's Government have been asked to set up special
working groups to investigate the case.
</P>
<P>
Concerned government departments will deal harshly with those
who are found responsible for the import of the waste, in
accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
The case of imported waste has aroused close attention from the
Chinese government. Vice-Premier Li Lanqing wrote an instruction
asking concerned departments to quickly investigate the case and
severely punish those who were responsible.
</P>
<P>
An official with the State Bureau for Environmental Protection
told Xinhua today about the current state of the case:
</P>
<P>
The garbage was shipped from Long Beach in the US State of
California and unloaded at the Qingdao port in July 1995. It was
imported from a US company by the Zhiqiang Straw Fiber Company
under the description of "waste paper" through the China Oceanic
Shipping Company.
</P>
<P>
The garbage, shipped in 29 containers weighing 639.4 tons, was
transported to the Jinghua Paper Mill of the Zhiqiang Straw Fiber
Company in Xishan Village, Pinggu County on Beijing's outskirts in
September 1995, after going through concerned customs procedures.
</P>
<P>
After receiving the containers, the Zhiqiang Company found that
water and impurity substances contained in the "waste paper"
exceeded 20 percent, and the "waste paper" was actually urban
domestic waste from the US. But the Zhiqiang Company did not make
any report to concerned departments.

<HEADLINE> VMs in HK Transferred from Troubled Detention Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 10 (Xinhua) -- More than 800 Vietnamese migrants
(VMs) have been transferred from Whitehead Detention Center to
High Island Detention Center this evening, according to the latest
official information.
</P>
<P>
The transfer was carried out after an incident broke out at the
 Whitehead Detention Center early this morning with some 200 VMs
escaping. The VMs set fire on the center and staged a sitting
protest.
</P>
<P>
Official information said that so far 61 escaped VMs have been
recaptured, while the others are still at large.
</P>
<P>
Three police officers, eight officers of the Correctional
Services Department (CSD) and six VMs have been treated in
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
In the fire which broke out at 4:57 a.m., a number of detention
huts, offices, barracks, storerooms and 53 vehicles were severely
damaged. Firemen used 12 jets and two helicopters to put out the
fire at 3:29 p.m.
</P>
<P>
During the incident, 15 CSD officers were taken hostage by a
group of VMs but were released four hours later.
</P>
<P>
Police and CSD officers fired tear gas canisters to get the
situation under control.
</P>
<P>
The perimeter of the center has now been secured. Police and
CSD have now entered the center and are conducting a head count
with a view to determining the number of escapees.

<HEADLINE> Imported Waste Case under Investigation (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During on-the-spot investigations, the State Bureau for
Environmental Protection found that there were only 651 bundles of
so-called "waste paper" left, weighing about 520.8 tons.
</P>
<P>
Tests show that 325 out of the 651 bundles of "waste paper"
were basically domestic waste, 269 bundles were mixture of waste
paper and garbage, and only 57 bundles were mainly waste paper.
</P>
<P>
Opening these bundles, the bureau found that impurity
substances contained in the "waste paper" exceeded 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
These impurity substances included dirty plastic bags, sewage,
pieces of waste fabric, used disposable syringes, discarded pill
bottles, worn rubber gloves, and unidentified white powder.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, toadstools and worms were found in all the bundles
of "waste paper".
</P>
<P>
The bureau officials said that, according to the relevant
international treaty, 47 kinds of waste are strictly forbidden
from export, with medical waste on the top of the list.
</P>
<P>
After finding medical waste in the "waste paper", the State
Bureau for Environmental Protection ordered the Beijing Municipal
Bureau for Environmental Protection to fence off the waste, take
necessary anti-pollution measures and make preparations for
sending back the garbage after further investigation into the case.
</P>
<P>
The official pointed out that this case seriously violates
relevant international treaties and China's related laws.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the case has also shown that there are
some unscrupulous businessmen who will stop at nothing to make
money, even by damaging the state's interest, and there are some
weak points in the Chinese customs setup.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Washington Meeting on Ceasefire in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The five-party meeting opens in
Washington today to discuss the formation of a committee charged
with monitoring a ceasefire understanding reached between Israeli
forces and Lebanon's guerrillas of Hezbollah, or Party of God,
last month.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, to be attended by representatives from the United
States, France, Israel, Syria and Lebanon, is expected to witness
heated debates due to the differences among the parties.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be at the ambassadorial level and under the
chairmanship of Dennis Ross, American coordinator of the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources in Damascus disclosed that Syria has decided
to send its ambassador in Washington Walid al-Muallem to the
meeting that would examine ways of supervising the implementation
of the ceasefire agreement, which put an end to 16 days of Israeli
military offensives in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The meeting would discuss at least three different proposals
regarding the composition, level, headquarters, prerogative and
funding of the committee.
</P>
<P>
Two of the three proposals have been presented by the U.S. and
France respectively, and the other one put forward jointly by
Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Lebanon submitted their proposal as a challenge to
the U.S. one against the background that Damascus and Washington
have expressed their skepticism about each other's credibility in
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, for the first time,
recently has publicly expressed his doubt over Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad's seriousness about peace, accusing Assad of being
in a state of wavering toward making peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to Christopher's remarks, Syria questioned the
credibility of Washington as an honest broker in the regional
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Both Syria and Lebanon oppose applying any political nature or
dimension to the proposed monitoring committee or its five member
states, upholding that the committee be restricted to the military
and technical aspects of supervision of the ceasefire
understanding.
</P>
<P>
They also demand that the chairmanship of the committee be
alternating, its headquarters be in the region, and that it should
not become an alternative to Arab-Israeli peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Lebanon have also proposed that the committee be
formed at the level of military officers, and should work in
cooperation with the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL).
</P>
<P>
In addition to differences between the U.S. on the one hand and
Syria and Lebanon on the other hand, the Washington meeting would
also be marked by differences between the U.S. and France.
</P>
<P>
France stands for a balanced composition of the committee
instead of a US-dominated one, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the differences, all parties would be trying to reach a
compromise acceptable to all, they said.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Diet Approves Budget for Fiscal 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese Diet (Parliament) today
finally approved the fiscal 1996 state budget that includes a
controversial government scheme to liquidate seven failed housing
loan companies known as "jusen".
</P>
<P>
The 75.1 trillion yen (751 billion U.S. dollars) budget for
fiscal 1996 that started from April 1 has been overdue for nearly
six weeks, obliging the government to rely on a 50-day stopgap
budget.
</P>
<P>
At its plenary session, the House of Councillors, the upper
house of Japan's parliament, voted to pass the budget, which had
already cleared the more powerful lower house, the House of
Representatives, a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
Amid strong public criticism of the use of taxpayers' money,
the government is now seeking to offset the outlay by seeking
additional contributions from private financial institutions to
the liquidation scheme.
</P>
<P>
After top-level discussions, the ruling parties -- the Liberal
Democratic Party, the Social Democratic Party and New Party
Sakigake -- finally agreed that all efforts should be made to have
the "jusen" loans reclaimed and call on financial institutions
connected with the "jusen" fiasco to make new contributions.
</P>
<P>
Under Japan's constitutional rules, even without any vote in
the upper house, the fiscal 1996 budget was set to automatically
become law by the end of the day today as it cleared the lower
house on April 11.
</P>
<P>
Following the passage of the budget, Shinshinto, the leading
opposition party, released a statement renewing its vow to cancel
the planned use of the tax money by killing bills on legislating
the liquidation scheme when a new special Diet panel on financial
issues begins debating the bills.
</P>
<P>
The party accused the government of having decided the use of
the 685 billion yen in tax money in closed-door discussions and
for allowing those who should take the burden for the fiasco of
the "jusen" evade their responsibility.

<HEADLINE> Australian Gold Production To Surge This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Gold production in Australia, the
world's third largest gold producer, is expected to reach a record
high this year.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Associated Press (AAP) quoted a world-wide
survey by Gold Fields Mineral Services Ltd. as saying that
Australia's gold production dropped 0.5 percent to 254 tons in
1995.
</P>
<P>
But the survey said that the decrease of production was mainly
due to natural disasters, such as a cyclone that drenched many
gold mines in West Australia in March last year.
</P>
<P>
There had been sizable increase of reserve in existing deposits
in Australia since early 1995 and new discoveries were still
growing, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
These factors were expected to boost the country's gold
production to a record high this year.
</P>
<P>
Australia is among the top three gold producers in the world,
following South Africa and the United States.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's gold production slid by more than 10 percent to
522 tons in 1995, while the US turned out 329 tons last year.
</P>
<P>
Cost of gold production was on the rise, the survey said.

DAR ES SALAAM, May 10 (Xinhua) -- A Finnish traing company,
Ecotec International, has expressed its intention to run and
develop the state-owned rubber plantations in the isles, reports

</P>
<P>
Director of Ecotec International, which ferries oil to
Zanzibar and neighboring countries on joint ventures with the

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania Hotels Investment
Ltd (TAHI) is to build a second five-star hotel here to be called
Novotel Dar across Avalon cinema.
</P>
<P>
TAHI Marketing Representative Mariam Issa told reporters here
on Thursday that studies for the world class hotel will be
commissioned soon.
</P>
<P>
The area overlooking Avalon cinema has for many years been of
interest to many world class hotel chains, among them Sheraton,
Intercontinental, Hilton and Serena hotels.
</P>
<P>
The Sheraton ceased to be a contender after acquiring the plot
on Ohio Street where it has built Tanzania's first five-star
hotel, the Sheraton Hotel.
</P>
<P>
Novotel Dar will join a family of hotels comprising Novotel
Mount Meru, Lake Manyara Hotel, Ngorongoro, Seronera and Lobo
Safari Lodges and Mafia Island Lodge.
</P>
<P>
TAHI recently completed major rehabilitation and refurbishment
of its lodges and hotels at a cost of US Dollars 15 million.
</P>
<P>
The group's operations manager Randolph Edmonds claimed the
Dar es Salaam venture will set the pace for world class hotel
standrds in Tanzania as well as stimulate visitor interest to
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
TAHI is jointly owned by the Tanzanian government and the
France-based Accor Group of Hotes. The group owns and manages
over 2000 hotels worldwide.

DAR ES SALAAM, May 10 (Xinhua) -- South African investors have
shown growing interest in moving their capital to Tanzania, an
Investment Promotion Centre (IPC) offical has disclosed today.
</P>
<P>
The official said the mining sector had especially aroused big
interest amongst South African companies. Willcroft Company
Limited of South Africa, the main shareholder in the Williamson
Diamonds Limited, has invested US dollars 12 million into Mwadui
of Tanzania, after reaching an agreement with the Tanzanian
government in October 1994.
</P>

Three more companies have indicated interest to invest in the
mining sector. They are Anglo-American mining conglomerate,
Johannesburg Consolidated Investment and the Randbold. All the
companies are listed in the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, the IPC
official explained. They will invest Rand 32 million (about 8.75
million US dollars) between now and next year.
</P>
<P>
They will join pioneer companies in Tanzania, such as South
African Breweries, which successfully concluded a joint venture
with the Tanzania government at the end of 1993.
</P>
<P>
South African Breweries now own 45.8 percent of the Tanzania
Breweries Limited while Tanzania government has 40.4 percent. The
rest of shares is distributed between the International Finance
Corporation, Propaco of France, Dresner of Germany and a Dutch
development finance house.
</P>
<P>
A South African company has bought Kwanza bottlers located in
Dar es Salaam which produces coca cola soda. This company is

<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- A symposium on "Young Volunteers'
Activities and the Promotion of Socialist Ethincs and Cultural
Development" was held here today.
</P>
<P>
Gong Xinhan, deputy head of the Propaganda Department of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), said that
the young volunteers' activities have promoted the construction
work of socialist spiritual civilization in China.
</P>
<P>
Millions of young Chinese people have participated in the
nationwide "Young Volunteers Activity" campaign since it was
launched by the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of
China (CYLC) at the end of 1993.
</P>

The campaign is aimed at encouraging more people, especially
young people, to volunteer to lend a hand to the needy and do more

people, those in want and need, and old people living alone. They
also offer financial help to those residents living in the
country's poorest areas and aid rescue and reconstruction work in
disaster-stricken regions.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, they provide a series of technological,
scientific and educational programs for farmers and herdsmen with
the aim of helping them become better off.
</P>
<P>
There have been many countrywide volunteer drives launched for
large-scale events, including the Sixth Far East and South Pacific
Games for the Disabled, the UN Fourth World Conference on Women
and the 43rd World Table-Tennis Championships.
</P>
<P>
A group of local young people agreed at the symposium that they
will make still greater efforts in the drive and serve the country
and its people better.

<HEADLINE> Korea To Build Largest Zinc Smelter In Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Republic of Korea will build
the world's largest zinc smelter in Australia.
</P>
<P>
Queensland state Minister for Economic Development and Trade
Doug Slack announced today that construction of the
one-billion-Australian-dollar (800-million-US-dollar) smelter
would begin later this year.
</P>
<P>
The smelter will produce 170,000 tons of zinc metal annually,
making it the largest zinc smelter in the world. The majority of
the production, or 225 million Australian dollar (180 million US
dollar) worth of zinc metal, will be exported every year.
</P>
<P>
"It will add approximately 50 percent to the tonnage of refined
zinc metal exported from Australia, and represents an increase of
20 percent in the proportion of Australia's zinc raw material that
will be processed domestically, rather than shipped offshore in
raw material form," Slack said.
</P>
<P>
At present, only 30 percent of the ore is refined in Australia.
</P>
<P>
The Korea zinc smelter is wholly owned by the Korea Zinc Group,
one of the top metallurgical producers in the Republic of Korea.
It will be located in the mining and metallurgical town of
Townsville, about 2,400 km north of Sydney.
</P>
<P>
"The Korea zinc smelter has the potential to make Queensland
the largest zinc producing region in the world," Slack said.

opportunities in manufacturing and other fields.
</P>

improvement in trade and investment linkages between the two

presence felt in Malaysia, given Malaysia's rapid and successful
economic growth.

Anwar also told Hashim of Malaysia's current move away from
labor-intensive industries to capital-intensive and
high-technology industries as well as information technology as
part of its strategy to achieve industrialization targets under

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Foreign Affairs and
Trade Department forecast that China's economy would expand 50
percent in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
In its latest newsletter on Asian business, the department said
that China's economic growth rate would slow down to a more
sustainable level this year from a "very high" level.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the economy registered a 10.2 percent annual growth
rate.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has set a target of achieving a
nine-percent economic expansion this year.
</P>
<P>
The Australian newsletter said that inflation would decline in
1996 as China's central government held on to the existing tight
monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
"The challenges ahead are significant, involving major
structural and institutional changes, but China's long-term
economic fundamentals continue to improve," the newsletter said.
</P>
<P>
It said that high level of savings and investment would
continue to be the driving forces of economic expansion in China.

<HEADLINE> Reconvening Of Zambia's Inter-Party Summit Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 10 (Xinhua)-- The Law Association of Zambia (LAZ)
has written letters to President Frederick Chiluba and the ruling
party chief, asking to reconvene the aborted inter-party summit
as a matter of urgency to defuse tension, Times of Zambia
reported today.
</P>
<P>
LAZ Chairman George Kunda was quoted as saying that his
organization wrote letters to President Chiluba and National
Secreatry of the ruling Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD)
Michael Sata, expressing concerns about the breakdown of the
inter-party meeting.
</P>
<P>
The inter-party meeting was aborted shortly after it began on
May 6 due to the opposition parties' refusal to allow President
Chiluba to chair the meeting. The opposition has demanded that a
neutral body should chair the meeting and LAZ was chosen as the
chairman.
</P>
<P>
Kunda said LAZ wanted to keep the spirit of dialogue alive
between the ruling and opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
It was not too late to discuss the constitution bill although
it was being tabled in parliament, he added.
</P>
<P>
The inter-party summit, attended by heads of all political
parties, was designed to discuss inportant national issues
including the adoption of the draft constitution and the process
of the coming general elections. enditem

<HEADLINE> Hubei Improves Road Networks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Hubei Province in central China has
witnessed a major improvement in its road networks in the last
five years.
</P>
<P>
Information provided by the local Department of Communications
shows that in the 1991-1995 period the province built 6,300 km of
new highways, bringing its total highway length to more than
30,000 km.
</P>
<P>
The showpieces of the five years are the 350-km-long expressway
linking Yichang City, the site of the Three Gorges Dam, with
Huangshi City, and a bridge over the Yangtze River near Huangshi.
</P>
<P>
Besides investment by the central and provincial governments,
more and more funds came from the local governments and bank loans
for highway construction, according to officials from the
department.
</P>
<P>
In the last five years more than 2.6 billion yuan was thus
raised from local governments and bank loans, accounting for a
quarter of the money spent on road construction.
</P>
<P>
Overseas funds were also used. The construction of the Huangshi
Yangtze River Bridge used a loan of 3.7 billion Japanese yen. The
upgrading of the No.107 and No.106 national highways used 100
million yuan from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
More recently, the province has granted the operation of the
Wuhan-Huangshi Expressway to a Malaysian business, in return for
more capital for new road projects.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that this bold move will open up a new source of
capital for the province's road expansion drive.

<HEADLINE> 16 Beijing Hospitals Set Up Anti-Smoking Clinics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital has opened a
number of anti-smoking clinics in its 16 hospitals in the run-up
to a ban on smoking in public places scheduled for May 15.
</P>
<P>
This move is aimed at teaching smokers how to quit the habit,
instead of the traditional way of only publicizing the adverse
effects of smoking.
</P>
<P>
Experts said Beijing will thus boast the largest number of such
clinics in the country, though some other major cities have
started to restrict smoking in public places.
</P>
<P>
These clinics will teach people how to stop smoking with the
help of some special methods and medicines, as a survey has
shown that almost 90 percent of smokers wish to quit smoking.
</P>
<P>
This is part of a massive anti-smoking drive in Beijing, as
all local officials and residents are urged to do their bit in
the fight against smoking.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Beijing Medical College announced that it would
no longer recruit students who smoke, nor employ graduates who
smoke to teach at the school or work in hospitals attached to the
college.
</P>
<P>
China, a country with a population of 1.2 billion, has 350
million smokers, including five million teenage smokers whose
number is on the rise.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Opposition Leader Says Syria Not Ready </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Israel's opposition leader
Binyamin Netanyahu has said that he does not believe the Syrians
are ready for peace with Israel, The Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who heads the country's main opposition party Likud
in the upcoming general elections scheduled for May 29, made the
remarks Thursday in an interview with the English-language
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"Syria is not ripe," said Netanyahu, who runs for the premier
in the elections. "I do not think a peace treaty is achievable
with Syria at this time."
</P>
<P>
He said that he was not giving up on normalization of ties with
Syria, but that he believed Israel should try to reach agreements
with Syria that do not involve its withdrawal from the Golan
Heights.
</P>
<P>
Syria has demanded a total Israeli pullout from the Golan
Heights, captured by the Israeli army from the Syrians during the
1967 Middle East war, and has put it as a precondition for any
peace agreement with Israel.
</P>
<P>
On the Palestinian track of the Middle East peace process, the
Likud leader said that for Israel's security or the maintenance of
peace, he would not rule out the possibility of dealing with
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat if he
becomes prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"But I do not want to run after Arafat," he said. "And I do not
think that he (Arafat) deserves the right now for a clear response
to that question since he has not fulfilled any of his
obligations."
</P>
<P>
On the domestic front, Netanyahu asserted that a government
under his leadership would invest more money in infrastructure,
transportation, education and settlement activity in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he said, the government would be "weaned away
from" 1.2 billion U.S. dollars of U.S. non-military assistance to
Israel and lower taxes.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's interview came as the election campaigns switched
into high gear, with the propaganda broadcasts of the political
parties running in the elections began on television Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
For the next three weeks before the election day, campaign
"commercials" will fill the airwaves, and activities on the
street will be intensified.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and Prime Minister Shimon Peres, the two candidates
for the new prime minister which will be directly elected for the
first time in Israel's history, will face off directly on May 26,
when they hold a debate on television.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Leather Industries Perform Successfully </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian leather
industries, which were in the verge of collpase three years ago,
are now performing well after privatisation.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released here on Thursday by the
Ministry of Industry and Trade, production in the Moshi Leather
Industries Ltd. had trippled from 1.3 million sq. meters in 1994
to over 3 million sq. meters in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Moshi, which laid off all its workers, had now re-employed 75
workers. It is expected that the number of workers would increase
up to 120 workers this year.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the industry, which was privatised two
years ago, had 75 shares owned by the Industrial Promotion
Services (IPS) and the government remained with only 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Another leather company, African Leather Industries (ATD) also
recorded positive signs. It operated at 40 percent of its
production capacity in 1993/94 and 70 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
ATD owns 60 percent of its shares while the government owns 40
percent. Before starting the joint venture in 1993, the
enterprise was producing at 10 percent of its installed capacity.
</P>
<P>
The Morogoro Shoe Company, which is now called G and T Shoe
Co. Ltd. has increased its production from 45 pairs of shoes in
1993 to 2,000 pairs last year.
</P>
<P>
The report said, the industry had increased employment from 35
workers before the establishment of the joint-venture to 260 at
present.
</P>
<P>
Other leather industries which recorded success include
Tanzania Leather Industries, formerly called Morogoro Tanneries
and Bora Industries Ltd. It managed to employ 20 workers in 1993
after suspension of production for four years.
</P>
<P>
ATD owns 55 percent while Tanzania Investment Bank (TIB) owns
45 percent of its shares, and its workers will increase to 250
in number in near future, according to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Rehabilitation of Bora Shoe, which was wholly privatised, was
over and production of rubber sandals started in March this year,
the ministry said. enditem

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Hopes to Eliminate Poverty by 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 10 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong Province
intends to help local 800,000 destitute people cast off poverty by
the end of 1997, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the province's nearly ten years of efforts at
abolishing poverty, the number of poor people in local mountainous
areas have been reduced from four one million to 800,000,
according to governor Lu Ruihua.
</P>
<P>
And 61 percent of the destitute live in 16 seriously
poverty-stricken counties, hampering local economic development.
</P>
<P>
In order to boost the anti-poverty project, local authorities
will allocate 400 million yuan in aid-the-poor funds to the 16
counties.
</P>
<P>
Eight coastal cities, including Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai and
Shantou, will shoulder the responsibility of supporting the 16
counties.

DALIAN, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Seven towns in the Ganjinzi District
in the suburbs of Dalian, a port city in northeast China's
Liaoning Province, have had more than 60,000 tons of waste removed
by 62 street cleaning teams, with more than 500 workers, since the
teams were organized in March last year.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, many farmers in suburban Dalian have built new
homes, making the need for workers to clear waste in the streets
more urgent.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities placed emphasis on improving sanitation. They
invested more than five million yuan to set up professional
environmental sanitation teams for each village.
</P>
<P>
These teams are equipped with 82 waste trucks, tractors, and
handcarts. More than 800 dustbins and waste collection points have
been established.

<HEADLINE> Shenyang Catches 400,000 Rats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 10 (Xinhua) -- This capital of northeast China's
Liaoning Province has eliminated a total of 400,000 rats since it
started a massive rodent-control campaign in late March this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the "Yangcheng Evening News" Wednesday, the local
residents have handed over 400,000 rat tails to the government,
in return for one yuan (one US dollar is 8.3 yuan) each.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the number of rats caught has surpassed the local
government's expectation.
</P>
<P>
A worker at a local grain depot provided some 6,000 rats tails,
while a six-member farming family captured a total of 1,000 rats
in one night.
</P>
<P>
The campaign will end May 20, and the local health-care
department has spent 400,000 yuan on it. But this has still saved
some money, compared with the usual practice of the government
each year providing rat poison free of charge.
</P>
<P>
The campaign is aimed at eradicating rats and making local life
a lot healthier, as rats have caused great losses for the city and
the number of incidents of rat-related diseases has increased by
17 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
In January, the pilot reform city of Shenzhen in south China's
Guangdong Province, which neighbors Hong Kong, launched a similar
campaign, offering the local people five yuan for each rat tail.
</P>
<P>
This year is the "Year of the Mouse" by the traditional Chinese
calendar.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Vows To Crush Any Uprising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 10 (Xinhua)-- Ugandan incumbent President Yoweri
Museveni has vowed to crush any uprising that may erupt in the
wake of the country's first direct presidential elections held on
May 9, reported the local newspaper the Monitor today.
</P>
<P>
The president was quoted as saying, "they may attempt but they
will be crushed. We have deployed security personnel massively
including militias and we shall contain the situation in case of
any uprising."
</P>
<P>
Museveni who was accompanied by his wife arrived at the
polling station in his home district, over 300 kilometres
southwest of Kampala at 3:10 p.m. yesterday, an hour later than
the scheduled.
</P>
<P>
He explained that he was forced to come late because he had to
ensure that there was enough security in the capital city since
there had been a lot of rumors that some people were planning to
cause chaos in towns during and after the elections.
</P>
<P>
After voting, Museveni told pressmen that he is sure of a
clear win but declined to estimate figures.
</P>
<P>
He also denied reports that he had declared that he would not
leave power.
</P>
<P>
"What I said is that the rest (opponents) are not capable and
it is only me who is capable of leading this country, but if the
people decide otherwise I will go home and do my other work."

<HEADLINE> Cross-Straits Guangdong-Hainan Communications Facility Proposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese engineers have proposed
setting up a fixed communications facility across the Qiongzhou
Straits that separates south China's Guangdong and Hainan
provinces.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary feasibility study of the project was passed by
a group of experts from the Chinese Academy of Engineering and the
Ministry of Communications Thursday in Haikou, the capital of
Hainan.
</P>
<P>
The study had been organized by the Guangdong Humen Technology
Service Company, with the participation of eight domestic
professional units and a Japanese firm.
</P>
<P>
Hainan was formerly a part of Guangdong. Since it became an
independent province and the largest special economic zone in
China in 1988, the island province in the South China Sea has seen
rapid economic growth.
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the straits is Guangdong Province, one of
the largest and most dynamic regional economies in China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ministries of railways and communications both have
plans to link up Hainan with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Communications plans to build a national
highway from Heilongjiang Province in the northeast of China to
Sanya City in the south of Hainan.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Railways is now building a ferry system that
will link the railway on the island with the mainland railway
network by 1999.
</P>
<P>
At present there are 46 ferry boats which can carry a total of
1,041 vehicles, and 20 passenger vessels with 130,000 seats
operating in the straits. Each year these boats can ferry 1.91
million vehicles and 20 million passengers.
</P>
<P>
The experts estimate that the current ferry capacity will be
saturated by the year 2003. Considering the operation of the
railway ferry system and the expansion of the current ferry
berths, traffic across the straits is likely to become congested
again in 2010.
</P>
<P>
Options given by the experts include a bridge, tunnels and
combined bridge and tunnels.
</P>
<P>
Though technological difficulties exist, they can be overcome,
the study says.
</P>
<P>
The study urges that preparations for the work should start
right now. The construction work should be started in 2010 and be
completed by 2020.
</P>
<P>
It holds an optimistic view on the huge sum of capital involved
in such a project, suggesting that the expanding regional economy
and overseas businesses may ease the fund-raising work.

<HEADLINE> China to Investigate, Deal with "Foreign Waste" Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese authorities will
investigate and deal harshly with those who are responsible for
the import of nearly 640 tons of urban life garbage from the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made today at a joint meeting of nine
government departments, including the State Bureau of Environment
Protection, the Ministry of Public Security, the State
Administration for Industry and Commerce and the General
Administration of Customs.
</P>
<P>
The garbage was shipped from the United States and unloaded at
the Qingdao port in east China's Shandong Province, officials of
the State Bureau of Environmental Protection said, adding that it
is the first time that so much imported garbage has been
discovered in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The garbage, weighing 639 tons, was discovered by the Beijing
Municipal Bureau for Environmental Protection near Dahuashan
Township in Pinggu County on April 30. It had been imported from
the US by the Zhiqiang Straw Fiber Company under the name of
"waste paper" through the China Ocean Shipping Company.
</P>
<P>
Packed in containers, the garbage passed through the Qingdao
Customs last July and arrived at the paper mill last September,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Dirty plastic bags, sewage, pieces of waste fabric, used
disposable syringes, discarded pill bottles, worn rubber gloves,
and unidentified white powder were found in the bundles.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the spread of pollution and an outbreak of endemic
diseases, the authorities have ordered the closure of the site where
the garbage was found and taken disease-prevention measures.
</P>
<P>
The incident is a violation of international conventions as
well as Chinese laws, and the joint inspection team will conduct
further investigations and deal strictly with the culprits,
officials said.

economic centre, should achieve an average per capita gdp of 1,500
U.S. dollars a year by the turn of the century, said a political

<HEADLINE> Swan-song for 469 of the Xinjiang Birds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, May 10 (Xinhua) -- A total of 469 swans were killed by
the biggest snowstorm in almost 50 years in the southwestern part
of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Local wildlife organizations are making an effort to rescue
those birds which are still alive and try to provide enough food
for them. Some rare animals are still in danger, however, as water
remains frozen.
</P>
<P>
An examination of the swans revealed that they weighed four to
five kg, half their normal body weight, because of lack of
food. The females had no eggs, meaning that there will be few
young ones born in June.
</P>
<P>
According to Gu Zhengqin, head of a local animal protection
organization, it is difficult to get into local nature reserves,
and the total number of various wild animals killed is still not
known. He urged everyone to lend a hand or donate money and
materials to help reduce losses.
</P>
<P>
The storm deposited between 40 and 80 cm of snow on the three
major nature reserves in the region, and posed a threat to other
wildlife, such as leopards, ibexes, pseudois nayaurs, ovis ammons,
and snow pheasants. It also cut a local county's number of
livestock in half.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the local swan reserve is the largest in Asia and
plays host to over 16,000 swans each spring. But this year, there
are only 7,600 of the birds there.
</P>
<P>
In April, the biggest snowstorm hit the southern part of the
region, causing a great deal of trouble locally, but there were no
reports of human casualties.
</P>
<P>
Gu noted that the number of deaths is less than expected
because of help people gave the wildlife after the snowstorm hit,

<HEADLINE> China Invests More in Fixed Assets This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- China invested 129.87 billion yuan
in fixed assets during the first quarter of this year, a rise of
16.2 percent over the same period of last year, according to
preliminary statistics issued by the State Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate is 21 percentage points down from the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
A bureau official said that the structure of the investment was
not very rational as investment in technical upgrading and
renovation grew too slowly while real estate investment rose too
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
China's investment in real estate amounted to 28.51 billion
yuan during the first quarter, an increase of 35 percent over the
same period of last year. However, investment in technical
upgrading and renovation improved by only 1.6 percent,
representing a drop of 24 percentage points from the corresponding
period of last year in terms of growth rate.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, investment in capital construction rose by 8.7
percent during the first quarter, a drop of 35.9 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
Also during the first quarter, China started construction of
4,000 projects in the field of capital construction, technical
upgrading and renovation, 605 less than in the same period of last
year.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the State Planning Commission said that 454 big
and medium-sized capital construction projects, which were
initiated during the Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995),
stride over into the ninth five-year plan period.
</P>
<P>
"The total scale of investment for these projects surpasses
1.55 trillion yuan," he said. "Counting the amount of money
already invested, a total of 1.1 trillion yuan is yet to be
invested."
</P>
<P>
He added that these 454 projects are invested by the state
sector, and that if those of the non-state sector is considered,
the total scale of China's fixed assets investment would be more
than five trillion yuan, with 2.8 trillion yuan to be invested
during this year and later.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that China will strengthen its macro-control
of fixed assets investment this year.
</P>
<P>
China's fixed assets investment developed at annual rates of
42.6 percent and 58.6 percent in 1992 and 1993, respectively. The
rate slowed down to 31.4 percent in 1994 and 18.8 percent last
year.

<P>
XINING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Qinghai Province
has created a minor miracle with 20,000 successful afforestation
projects on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, 4,000 meters above sea
level, over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
They include planting trees on 2,520 hectares, fencing more
than 78,000 hectares of hilly land for tree planting, planting
more than one million trees in courtyards, and planting trees
across more than 70 patches of hilly land, with ninety-eight
percent of the trees surviving.
</P>
<P>
The projects were mostly in Yushu and Chindu counties in the
Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Yushu, and Baima county in the
Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Golog. They have done a lot to
halt the ecological deterioration along the upper reaches of the
Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
There are 156,000 square kilometers of areas covered by the
upper reaches of the Yangtze River in Qinghai, but part of the
areas suffered serious soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
More than 30,000 local people, 43 percent of the total
population in the areas, participated in tree planting in the
areas each year over the past five years.

<HEADLINE> News Background:  Sino-Ethiopian Cooperation In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin's forthcoming visit to Addis Ababa has been seen as another
important event in the friendship annals between China and Ethiopia.
His visit will open a new chapter in the development of freindly
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The friendship and cooperation between China and Ethiopia
could be traced back to 60 years ago when peoples of the two
countries supported each other in their national-defending
struggles against foreign invaders.
</P>
<P>
In 1935, residents in Shanghai, China's largest industrial
city, formed the Society of Ethiopia's Friends which raised funds
to support the Ethiopian people in their fight against the
Italian invaders.
</P>
<P>
And stimulated by the Ethiopian people's struggle, the Chinese
Red Army, on its Long March against the Japanese invaders, sent a
letter to the Ethiopians, expressing its support for their
struggle agaisnt the Italian invaders.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the founding of the People's Republic of China in
1949, the Chinese government has been attaching great importance
to the development of the Sino-Ethiopian relations.
</P>
<P>
In 1964, Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai visited Ethiopia at the
invitation of Emperor Haile Selassie. Zhou's tour laid the
foundation for the establishing of the diplomatic ties between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the establishment of the diplomatic ties between
China and Ethiopia in November, 1970, Emperor Haile Selassie paid
a state visit to China in 1971.
</P>
<P>
After the Ethiopian government led by Meles Zenawi took power
in 1991, the friendly relations continued to progress.
</P>
<P>
Reasons for the steady progress of the Sino-Ethiopian
relations lie in several factors. They include:
</P>
<P>
-- Both countries do not intend to interfere with each other's
internal affairs. The Ethiopian government has always stuck to
the "One China" policy while it is China's policy that the
Ethiopian people have the ability to solve their own problems.
</P>
<P>
-- The two countries have mutual respect to each other's
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
-- China and Ethiopia are willing to develop bilateral
economic cooperation based on the principles of equality and
mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
-- Both countries have similar historical and cultural
experiences. Both hold similar political views over most of the
world affairs.
</P>
<P>
During the recent years, the two countries have been promoting
their economic cooperation with the bilateral trade volume rising
to 31.88 million U.S. Dollars in 1995 from 7.36 million U.S.
Dollars in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi paid a visit to Beijing
last year. During his visit, an agreement on Sino-Ethiopian
economic and technological cooperation was signed.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian government has expressed its hope to draw from
China the successful experience in the development of
agriculture, small-scaled irrigation and electric projects.
</P>
<P>
China has been maintaining a medical team to render services
to Ethiopians. China also provided assistance to Ethiopia in
constructon of water supply and irrigation projects.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Ethiopian cooperation has enormous potentials and a
bright future. And President Jiang's visit to Ethiopia will serve
as a milestone in the development of bilateral relationship
between the two countries.

<P>
HONG KONG, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The police have arrested 55
Vietnamese migrants who had escaped from Whitehead Detention
Center (WHDC) in the early hours this morning, a spokesman of the
Hong Kong Government Information Services (GIS) said here today.
</P>
<P>
At about 4:15 a.m., a number of Vietnamese migrants broke out
of Section 3 of WHDC and set alight several buildings in the
vicinity before heading for the administration block where they
torched most of the structures and a large number of vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the breakout at Section 3, another group of
Vietnamese migrants broke through the perimeter fence of Section 5
and escaped.
</P>
<P>
In an early GIS report, the number of the escaped migrants was
about 200.
</P>
<P>
At about same time, 15 officers from the Correctional Services
Department (CSD) were taken hostage by a group of Vietnamese
migrants in Section 5 but were released some four hours later. One
of the officers was stabbed in the leg but the rest were freed
unhurt.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that to restore order inside the center,
police and CSD officers fired a number of tear gas canisters to
control the situation.
</P>
<P>
In total, 17 huts were gutted and 43 vehicles, including 18
government vehicles, were destroyed, he said.
</P>
<P>
Twelve CSD officers, five policemen and five fire services
officers were injured in the incident, none of them seriously.
</P>
<P>
The perimeter of the center has now been secured. Police and
CSD have now entered the center and are conducting a head count
with a view to determining the number of escapees, he said.
</P>
<P>
There are now over 19,000 Vietnamese migrants in Hong Kong's
five detention centers including WHDC, Highland Detention Center
and Tai A Chau Detention Center.

<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Latin America's foreign debt grew to
574 billion U.S. dollars in 1995, or more than 1,270 dollars for
every man, woman and child on the continent.
</P>
<P>
Brazil and Mexico are the region's most indebted countries,
followed by Argentina, Peru, Chile and Colombia.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics, Brazil's foreign debt
reached 119 billion dollars at the end of 1994, accounting for 23
percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) and 2.7 times more
than the value of its exports which totaled 43.5 billion dollars
in 1994.

Mexico's foreign debt was about 101 billion dollars in 1995, an
18.13 percent increase over 1994, and the GDP/debt ratio rose to
40.7 percent from 32.7 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-seven percent of the debt is owed by the Mexican
government and 32.9 percent of the total debt is owed to
U.S. creditors.
</P>
<P>
An increase in Argentina's exports has lowered the debt-export

billion dollars in capital and interest in 1995, 2 billion dollars
more than in 1994.
</P>
<P>

approximately 40 percent of its GDP and 3.5 times the value of its
annual exports.

SHANGHAI, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's state-owned industrial
firms raised their assets to 183 billion yuan from 149.8 billion
yuan by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The share-holding corporations added 10.7 billion yuan to their
capital, reduced debts by 1.5 billion yuan, and lowered the
debt-asset ratio to 72.9 percent from 80 percent, local officials
said at an international seminar on this subject in Shanghai
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai established corporations in which the state
controls most of the shares, as part of efforts to revitalise
state enterprises by streamlining their structures and making
better use of capital.
</P>
<P>
It helped increase the value of state assets and steer
enterprises from direct government administration, vice-mayor
Jiang Yiren pointed out.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, Shanghai had authorised 33 such
corporations to manage 50 percent of locally-managed state assets
in the city, while drawing up regulations and putting in place a
responsibility mechanism to control the movement of state assets.
</P>
<P>
Capital and production materials have flown into industries and
enterprises with advantages, promoting a coalition between
different departments, industries and regions, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
State-controlled corporations in sectors such as machinery and
electronics, textiles, metallurgy, light industry and retail have

<HEADLINE> France To Boost Trade, Economic Ties With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 10 (Xinhua) -- French Ambassador to Tanzania,
Alain Du Boispean has said that France was all set to increase
its trade and other economic ties with Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here on Thursday, the envoy said
that the move follows the reality that trade between tanzania and
France was not as voluminous as it should be considering the great
potentiality of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"We have known each other for sometime but the trade volume is
still not that much sizeable. I think we have to open more doors for
these two countries to trade and involve themselves in other
economic activities", he suggested.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures show that the volume of trade between Tanzania
and France stands at between 150 million Francs or US dollars 13
million, too low compared to other countries like Kenya which had
more commercial links with France.
</P>
<P>
Such volume was small as it was not near that between Tanzania
and other European countries like the United Kingdom whose trade
links with Tanzania were quite significant, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Mr. du Boispean said the previous political-economic climate in
Tanzania as well as the fact that Tanzania was not France's
immediate trade partner like Franco-phone African countries were the
main reasons for the slow growth in the trade ties.
</P>
<P>
"But now political and economic doors in Tanzania have been
opened and international assistance has to be turned into commercial
partnership", he elaborated.

<HEADLINE> Tax Evasion Accounts for Half France's Deficits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Tax evasion accounts for half of
France's annual public deficits, according to a report submitted
by parliament to Prime Minister Alain Juppe today.
</P>
<P>
The report said most tax evaders are owners of businesses in
the "underground economy", illegal immigrants, unemployed people
who make false claims and others who don't pay all or part of
their taxes. Their unpaid taxes amount to 175 to 235 billion
francs (about 34 to 45.6 billion US dollars) in losses to the
state treasury.
</P>
<P>
The report said that of the 1.8 million people working in
factories and sweatshops in the underground economy, 40 percent
are illegal immigrants. Their unpaid taxes - 100 to 160 billion
francs (about 19 to 31 billion dollars) - account for 66 percent
of the losses from tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
Benefits paid to France's three million unemployed also account
for a large proportion of the deficits.
</P>
<P>
Of the 3.3 million people who collect unemployment benefits,
only 75 percent are actually jobless, the report said. A quarter
of unemployment benefits go to people who made false claims, it
said.
</P>
<P>
France's public deficits have remained high, with the 1994
figure rising to six percent of gross domestic product (GDP) from
five percent in 1995, but predicted to fall to 4.5 percent this
year and 3.5 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
The report recommended tax reforms, curbs on illegal
immigration, a public education campaign and stiffer penalties.
</P>
<P>
Juppe said the cabinet will discuss the report before July this
year and consider the recommendations.

<HEADLINE> Makinen Takes Early in Indoensia Auto Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Tommi Makinen of Finland raced to
an early lead on the first day of Asia's first world championship
motor rally on Friday, but was under intense pressure from British
World Champion Colin McRae.
</P>
<P>
Makinen, who has won the first two rounds of the World Rally
Championship, spun his Mitsubishi Lancer twice on plantation
roads in Indonesia's north Sumatra made treacherous by heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
He completed the first five stages of the three-day, 1,288-km
(761-mile) third championship leg in 44 minutes and 32 seconds,
five seconds less than McRae and 39 seconds ahead of Kenneth
Eriksson of Sweden.
</P>
<P>
After just five of the 27 stages, the rally has developed into
a duel between Makinen, McRae and Eriksson, both of them driving
Subaru.
</P>
<P>
The Mitsubishi team suffered a setback when young British
driver Richard Burns went off the road and damaged his oil
system, retiring with a sick engine on the third stage.
</P>
<P>
Spaniard Carlos Sainz hit trouble on his first visit to
Indonesia when his Ford lost third and fourth gears on the fifth
stage.
</P>
<P>
British team-mate Gwyndaf Evans was immediately knocked out of
the running when his Ford lost its brakes and then the power
steering failed.
</P>
<P>
The rally was next heading for Parapat before returning to the
north Sumatran capital of Medan for the finish on Sunday evening.

<HEADLINE> Peres Lashes Out At UN Over Report On Qana Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Shimon Peres has
challenged the U.N. by saying that its influence in Israel would
be undermined as a result of what he termed as "scandalous" and
"one-sided" report on the Qana incident, Israel Radio reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Peres made the statement when speaking to reporters during a
tour of north Israel Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
"It is very strange that UNIFIL allowed shots to be fired from
150 meters away from the camp, and that it allowed Hezbollah
members and their families to hide within the camp ... This
report is one sided, instigating great anger in Israel. I think as
a result, the influence of the U.N. in Israel will be greatly
weakened," he said.
</P>
<P>
The row between Israel and U.N. over Qana event appears to have
escalated when the U.N. report by investigator Maj.-Gen. Frank Van
Kappen, of the Netherlands, contended that the shelling, which
killed more than 100 Lebanese refugees, was not accidental as
Israel put it.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's U.N. ambassador, Samir Moubarak, is seeking to have
the Security Council condemn Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Acting Ambassador to the U.N. David Peleg charged
that the U.N. is at fault for failing to prevent more than 30
Hezbollah attacks from areas adjacent to U.N. camps and for
sheltering terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Chief Artillery Officer Brig.-Gen. Dan Harel went so far as
to say in New York that "U.N. deliberately sheltered Hezbollah
at Qana compound."
</P>
<P>
He charged that the U.N. had contributed to the incident by
sheltering Hezbollah.

<HEADLINE> Growth of State-Owned Assets Accelerates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- China's market economy drive has
accelerated the increase in the value of the country's state-owned
property, according to a national meeting which concluded here
today.
</P>
<P>
A press release quoted the latest statistics as showing that
the value of China's state-owned property has reached 5.192
trillion yuan (about 618 billion US dollars). The amount breaks
down into 4.132 trillion yuan in productive assets and 1.06
trillion yuan in non-productive assets.
</P>
<P>
The value of state-owned assets has grown by an average of 12.4
percent since 1949, when the People's Republic of China was
established. The annual growth rate is 14.5 percent for the years
since 1980, shortly after China launched its reform and opening-up
drive. Since 1990 the growth rate has averaged 17.9 percent a
year.
</P>
<P>
China's state-owned assets were valued at a mere 20 billion
yuan in 1949.
</P>
<P>
The release also shows that China's state-owned enterprises,
numbering 302,000, currently have assets worth 7.2873 trillion
yuan and liabilities of 5.1762 trillion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which started Wednesday, was attended by officials
from the Ministry of Finance, the State Economic And Trade
Commission, the State Administration of State Property and the
State Administration of Taxation.

<HEADLINE> Research on Grassland Degradation in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- China has worked out a series of
research programs to save the grassland of the 2.5-million-sq-km
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, located in the southwest part of China.
</P>
<P>
Over the past several decades, the grassland has deteriorated
because of increasing population, the development of animal
husbandry and other economic activities, rats and plant diseases.
</P>
<P>
The programs will focus on causes of grassland degradation,
namely, developing animal husbandry while improving the grassland,
getting rid of rats, and establishing experimental zones of
grassland recovery.
</P>
<P>
The plateau has a total population of 9.38 million, covering
the Tibet Autonomous Region, Qinghai, and parts of Gansu, Sichuan,
and Yunnan provinces, and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
It is more than 4,000 meters above sea level, and 3,000
kilometers from east to west and 1,600 from north to south. It
accounts for one-fourth of the country's area, and its natural
pasture area, 150 million hectares in total, accounts for
one-third of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
Experts point out that it now has 50 million hectares of
degraded grassland, one-third of the plateau's total area, and
that keeps growing.
</P>
<P>
The plateau is rich in grassland, forests, water, and mineral
resources, as well as rare plants and animals. It is also one of
the major animal husbandry bases in the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The Shougang Hierro Peru S.A., a
subsidiary of a Chinese iron and steel giant, today denied the
report that it was considering departure from Peru.
</P>
<P>
The company has no plans to leave Peru and will instead seek to
complete negotiations with Peruvian authorities to reschedule
investments in the country, company executives said.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the Beijing-based Shougang, or the Capital
Iron and Steel General Corporation, will meet in the next few days
with a commission appointed by Peru's private investment promotion
committee.
</P>
<P>
The plan for building a new plant is expected to be approved
during the meetings, said Shougang executives, who are running the
first iron and steel venture in this South American country.
</P>
<P>
The statements by Shougang, a major iron and steel producer in
China, were in response to a Western wire service report saying
that the company "was studying" its exit from Peru.
</P>
<P>
However, executives at the company's Peruvian operation and a
spokesman at its headquarters, who was contacted over the phone,
categorically denied the report and termed it as "rumor."
</P>
<P>
Shougang is poised to invest 230 million dollars in Peru
between now and 1999, company executives said.

<HEADLINE> Canada Passes Gay Rights Amendment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The parliament here passed an
amendment to the Canadian Human Rights Act this evening to
prohibit discrimination against gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
The controversial bill, known as Bill C-33, was passed with 153
votes for and 76 against it.
</P>
<P>
For weeks, there has been a fierce and bitter debate in Canada
on the bill, which bans discrimination on the grounds of sexual
orientation in federally regulated work places.
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the government bill argue that it would protect
about 10 percent of the country's work force from being
discriminated against for being homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
But opponents contend that it would lead to much more extensive
reforms, including same-sex benefits, more gay marriages and
adoptions by people in the gay community.

<HEADLINE> Double-Cropping in China's Northernmost Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese agronomists have found a way
to get two crops per year in areas as far north as 45 degrees
north latitude, in China's northernmost Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
This major breakthrough in a part of the country that used to
see only one harvest each year is the result of joint efforts by
Professors Wu Zongpu and Li Weixiong from the Northeast China
University of Agronomy. They have succeeded in developing
early-maturing varieties of soybeans and wheat.
</P>
<P>
Wu's "Dongnong 41" is the world's best early-maturing variety
of soybean, with only 80 days until maturity, while Li's "Dongnong
7757" can be harvested some 20 days earlier than other strains of
wheat.
</P>
<P>
"Dongnong 7757" is planted around March 25 each year and
harvested in early July. The soybeans are a late autumn crop.
</P>
<P>
Field trials for three consecutive years show that annual wheat
and soybean yields for each hectare of land with these strains
yielded as much as 4500 and 2400 kg, respectively, twice the
single crop output yearly.
</P>
<P>
The old record of frigid zone cultivation was set by the
Americans, who succeeded in wheat-soybean double-cropping on land
at 43 degrees north latitude.

<HEADLINE> TV Series on China's First Hydro-Electric Power Station </HEADLINE>

<P>
KUNMING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Filming of a 20-part TV series on
China's first hydro-electric power station that will air in the
first half of 1997, will start in the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
"Shilong Heaven Fire" tells the true story of the Chinese who
worked on the Shilongba Power Station, 40 kilometers from Kunming,
capital of southwest China's Yunnan Province, and reflects the
spirit of Chinese on revitalizing national industry in the early
20th century.
</P>
<P>
Local governments and people of various national groups in the
province established a company and started construction work on
the Shilongba Hydro-electric Power Station in 1910. The
480-kilowatt station began to generate electricity in 1912.
</P>
<P>
Over the next several decades, the station developed a total
installed capacity of 7,040 kilowatts, and attracted the attention
of hundreds of foreign experts and scholars.
</P>
<P>
Senior Chinese Communist Party and central government leaders
also followed construction work on the power station closely.
</P>
<P>
The series will be made jointly by Yunnan Provincial Television
Station and a Shanghai company at a cost of six million yuan.

<HEADLINE> Computers for 10 Percent of Chinese Families in Five Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Ten percent of Chinese families are
expected to possess computers in the next five years, bringing the
total personal computer (PC) market capacity to 10 million.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that about two million PCs are expected to enter
Chinese families each year on average, 10 times the figure in 1995.
</P>
<P>
It is common in the developed countries that when the PC
popularization rate hits 10 percent market sales tend to soar.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Electronics Industry (MEI), the
computer sales volume in 1995 stood at 1.1 million, some 200,000
of which had been bought by families.
</P>
<P>
In 1994 the sales volume was 700,000, some 100,000 of which
owned by families.
</P>
<P>
The MEI said that China's computer market capacity is expected
to soar to 1.5 million this year, 40 percent of which will enter
families, threefold the 1995 figure.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that five percent of the families in Shanghai,
China's largest city, have computers.
</P>
<P>
An MEI official said that automobiles, houses and computers
will become future hot-selling items among Chinese urbanites, who
find it hard to afford the former two at present because of such
factors as high prices.
</P>
<P>
But quite a few of them can afford computers, since the prices
have been on the decline steadily, he said.
</P>
<P>
The prices of various types of computers have reportedly
maintained a downward movement in China since the beginning of
this year.
</P>
<P>
The Legend Group, China's computer heavyweight, cut its
computer prices by eight to 30 percent in March this year.
</P>
<P>
Its Pentium computers cost less than 10,000 yuan (about 1,220
US dollars) each.

The province also plans to import more sophisticated technology
and equipment in the coming five years, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We plan to spend more money on research and development in
high-tech industries like new energy, new materials, biological
engineering, laser and optical fiber telecommunications, space and
marine engineering," he said.
</P>
<P>
Research institutes are being encouraged to cooperate with
enterprises and colleges in dealing with technical problems and
applying research to production, he added, while efforts will
continue to speed up construction of high-tech development zones
to use technology.
</P>
<P>
He said the provincial government has decided to improve
traditional industries such as textiles, clothing, and iron and
steel by using technology. High-tech industries over the past five
years developed 1,000 products, including LCD instruments,
telephone switchboards with 60,000 lines, large transformers, and
semi-conductor refrigeration instruments.
</P>
<P>
The province spent one billion yuan on electronics and
telecommunications equipment production during the 1991-95 period,
three times the amount of the previous 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The nearly 500 high-tech companies in development zones in
Hebei earned ten billion yuan from industrial production, and
trade and technology transfers last year, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Chirac: European Construction to Remain Top Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The European construction has been and
will continue to be his most important target of action, French
President Jacques Chirac said in a statement issued on Schuman
Day, the European Union's only homegrown holiday.
</P>
<P>
Celebrated each year on March 9, the holiday, sometimes called
Europe Day, marks the 1950 call by former French Foreign Minister
Robert Schuman for Germany and France to merge their coal and
steel industries.
</P>
<P>
The idea led to the six-nation European Coal and Steel
Community, the precursor of today's 15-nation EU.
</P>
<P>
President Chirac's statement, read out at a symposium on Europe
held here, stressed that the European construction should take
into account the concerns of European men and women, such as
employment, security, their children's future and fighting against
drug abuse and other contemporary social maladies.
</P>
<P>
The European construction has traversed an extraordinary course
since 1950, and Europe will "embrace a single European currency"
in two years, Chirac said.
</P>
<P>
But the undertaking of building up Europe is far from being
completed, he said, calling on all people supporting the cause to
put aside their quarrels over EU structures and make effort to
promote the advancement of Europe.
</P>
<P>
To lay out a common foreign and security policy and enhance
cooperation among member states in internal and judicial affairs
should be the new objectives of the European construction, Chirac
said.

<HEADLINE> Jakarta Asks US Compensation for Contaminated Cotton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian textile businesses have
demanded the US government take concrete measures to make the
cotton suppliers to pay for the damages caused by exporting
contaminated cotton to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian textile businessmen made the demand Thursday
when they were told that their imported cotton from the United
States was adulterated with cavitoma, Antara news agency reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The Japan Spinners Inspecting Foundation in a research last
month found cavitoma in the cotton sent to Indonesia by an
American supplier.
</P>
<P>
Cavitoma is a micro-organism which causes cotton fiber to
disintegrate and become brittle and deprives it of its absorbing
capacity. Consequently, production dropped drastically by up to 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
As a toxin, cavitoma may spread to other farm commodities in
Indonesia, textile producers said.
</P>
<P>
The cavitoma-affected cotton came from the farms in Yuma and
Imperial valley, California and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has been importing 45 percent of its cotton needs
from the United States. In 1995, Indonesia's total cotton imports
reached 2.4 million bales, including 925,000 bales from the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The cotton from the two areas in America has never been
exported to industrialized countries, such as Japan and South
Korea, business community here said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, spinners in Indonesia felt to have fallen victim to
discriminatory treatment by the American cotton suppliers.

DHAKA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE)
witnessed a buoyant trading during the week by Thursday with a
34.21-point gain in price index.
</P>
<P>
The market capital jumped by TK 2.33 billion (about 58.2
million US dollars) with the value increasing by TK 56.4 million
(1.41 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Sources said that the price index, market capital and value
advanced significantly though the volume declined by 64,248 shares

closing day of the week, amid a continuous rise during the week.
</P>
<P>
Some market players viewed the market as steady while others
differed, saying that the buoyant trend was a temporary phenomenon
as most of the small investors were not active in an organized
way.

There is no alternative of institutional support to small

<HEADLINE> Thailand Demands Share on Farm Products from EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is trying to enhance its
campaign, asking the European Union to grant it the same trade
tariff concessions as other countries.
</P>
<P>
The EU's new Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) on
agricultural imports would seriously affect Thai farm products,
local newspaper The Bangkok Post today quoted Thai Deputy Commerce
Minister Montri Danphaibul as saying.
</P>
<P>
Montri said the issue would be taken up through the World Trade
Organization (WTO) instead of the EU.
</P>
<P>
Thailand would cite the WTO agreement in asking the EU to treat
it the same way as 11 other countries which have been granted full
GSP privileges on the grounds they are combating the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
These are Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia,
Guatemala, Honduras, EL Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and
Panama.
</P>
<P>
Boontipa Simasakul, deputy director-general of Foreign Trade
Department, said a clause in the WTO agreement stated programs
helping developing countries must be applied without
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
Boontipa showed Thursday a document presented to the EU as
evidence of Thailand's commitment to effective action against drug
production and trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has budgeted 870 million baht (34.8 million US
dollars) for the fight against drug trafficking this year and will
spend 2.33 billion baht (93 million US dollars) on the campaign
next year.
</P>
<P>
According to the document, Thailand's efforts in the fight
against the drug trade may be comparable to the efforts made by
the Andean and Central American countries. Therefore, the EU
should apply its GSP scheme to Thailand in an objective and non-
discriminatory manner as it treats other countries.
</P>
<P>
Bangkok has also told the EU that cutting GSP benefits would
adversely affect more than 90 percent of Thai farm product sales
to the group, especially fish, vegetables, fruit and processed
foods.
</P>
<P>
Thailand also pointed out that its farming sector is not as
advanced as the EU believes, because farmers have a per capita
annual income of only 400 US dollars, compared with the 2,000 US
dollars national average.
</P>
<P>
Income figures are among criteria the EU considers in deciding
whether to withdraw GSP benefits from countries where economic
development has reached a certain level.

<HEADLINE> Thai Power Agency Moves to Prevent Blackouts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Electricity Generating
Authority of Thailand (EGAT) has launched an urgent program to
avert possible blackouts due to higher than expected power demand
growth under the pending Eighth National Development Plan
(1997-2001).
</P>
<P>
The recently revised load forecast for Thailand between 1997
and 2001 points to annual demand growth of 1,600 megawatts, 400 MW
higher than estimated.
</P>
<P>
Over the course of the eighth plan, this would mean demand for
an extra 2,000 MW not accounted for under the original estimates.
</P>
<P>
To meet this demand, the EGAT must boost its investment in
projects to create new power generation capacity, local newspaper
Bangkok Post today quoted EGAT Governor Preecha Chungwatana as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Preecha said that the EGAT would have to budget 280 billion
baht (11.2 billion US dollars) rather than the 240 billion baht
(9.6 billion US dollars) set aside earlier.
</P>
<P>
he said additional generating capacity would be needed to solve
possible power supply shortage in the country as well as to
provide some reserves.
</P>
<P>
Under the urgent adjustment to the EGAT's short-term power
development plan, endorsed by the EGAT board Wednesday, the
authority will secure additional power supplies by increasing its
purchases from independent power producers and small power
producers in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The EGAT will boost its power purchases from independent power
producers from the current limit of 4,200 MW under the stage I and
II programs (for supplies between now and 2002) to 4,900-5,000 MW.
At the same time, it will boost purchases from small power
producers to 3,000 MW.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, The EGAT board also discussed the possibility of
doubling power purchases from neighboring countries such as Laos,
Myanmar and China, to 3,000 MW.
</P>
<P>
An agreement made through the EGAT already allows Thailand to
buy 1,500 MW of electricity from Laos.

<HEADLINE> IMF Warns Of Overheating in Fast Growing Economies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has warned of the danger of overheating in fast growing
economies in the Asian region and called for necessary pre-emptive
policy measures to be taken in this regard.
</P>
<P>
According to a communique issued at the end of the 31st
Conference of Governors of South East Asian Central Banks and made
available here today, Dr. J.E. Ismael, IMF executive director for
South East Asia, called on the central bank governors to consider
the implications of the rapid pace of growth in the economies of
the Asian region.
</P>
<P>
In his presentation on "The Recurring Issue of Overheating in
Fast Growing Economies," Dr. Ismael warned that price pressures
and widening current account deficits in some economies were
forewarnings of overheating.
</P>
<P>
He observed that the authorities of member countries and IMF
staff were in broad agreement over the dangers of overheating and
the necessity of pre-emptive policy measures to avoid an even more
disruptive policy adjustment at a later stage.
</P>
<P>
He also noted the dilemma faced by some economies participating
in the conference between the need to raise interest rates as a
means of dampening domestic demand and the resultant surge in
capital inflows and upward pressure on exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
Some economies had responded by imposing administrative
measures to deter capital inflow, he said, adding that the IMF was
sympathetic to these short-term measures.
</P>
<P>
He said the IMF was also urging greater flexibility of the
exchange rate, though it noted the concern about the
competitiveness of the export sector.
</P>
<P>
The two-day 31st Conference of Governors of South East Asian
Central Banks was held here Wednesday and Thursday. The next
conference will be held in Thailand in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Singaporeans Spend 4.1 Billion Dollars Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Encouraged by the strong
Singapore dollar and growing affluence, Singaporeans spent about
4.1 billion US dollars abroad last year, which accounted for
almost 12 percent of total private consumption expenditure, the
Business Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the overseas spending, at current market prices,
has grown 20.6 percent a year over the last 25 years. As a
percentage of total private spending, Singaporeans' expenditure
abroad surged from 1.4 percent in 1970 to 11.9 percent in 1995, it
said.
</P>
<P>
In 1970, the overseas spending, at current prices, was just
about 38.3 million US dollars, compared to the 4.1 billion US
dollars spent overseas in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"This reflects the increase in Singaporeans traveling overseas
due to the strong Singapore dollar and growing affluence, as well
as greater emphasis on globalization," the Depart of Statistics
(DOS) was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the total private consumption
expenditure, which accounted for 41 percent of the Gross Domestic
Production last year, amounted to about 34.37 billion US dollars
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The components of private spending have changed significantly
over the last three decades, the DOS noted.
</P>
<P>
Basic necessities like food, which accounted for one-third of
total spending in 1960, took up only 12 percent in 1995, while the
shares of expenditure on cars, education and recreation, on the
other hand, have become increasingly more significant, the report
said.

magnetic suspension railway from Hamburg to Berlin.
</P>
<P>
The railway is for high-speed electric trains that are

</P>
<P>
The opposition Social Democratic Party and the Green party

money and a threat to the environment.
</P>
<P>
Ground-breaking for the 8.9 billion Deutsche Mark (5.86 billion
U.S dollars) railway is scheduled for 1998 and its completion for
2005. The funds will come from the federal government and the

<HEADLINE> Nobel Prize Winner's Novel To Be Published in Argentina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The most recent novel written
by Colombia's Nobel prize winner Gabriel Garcia Marquez will be
published in Argentina at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
The manuscript of the novel, "Noticias de un Secuestro," or
News of a Kidnapping, is already at the "Sudamericana" publishing
house, the publisher announced today.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the publisher said that Garcia Marquez's
literary agent arrived here last Sunday to deliver the manuscript
to the publishing house's representatives.
</P>
<P>
The new novel's style is "closer to detective stories than to
literature," the source said.
</P>
<P>
"Noticias de un Secuestro" is about an exhaustive journalistic
investigation into 10 kidnappings ordered in 1990 by Pablo Escobar
Gaviria, the Medellin cocaine cartel kingpin killed by police in
December 1993.
</P>
<P>
Although the novel tells about real life events, the author
himself says it is "more of a novel than any of my other novels,"
because of the extraordinary occurrences.
</P>
<P>
Garcia Marquez, who began writing books in 1946 and published
first novel in 1957, won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1982.
He was the first Colombian to win the prize.
</P>
<P>
Now at 68, Garcia Marquez's most famous novel is Cien anos de
Soledad, or One Hundred Years of Solitude, which was published in
1967.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Ruling Party's New Chief Elected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Senior leader Girija Prasad
Koirala was elected late Thursday the Nepali Congress (NC) party's
new president at the 9th NC general convention being held here.
</P>
<P>
Voting for the NC presidency was held Thursday evening although
efforts among top party leaders to reach a consensus on a
candidate were made until the last minute.
</P>
<P>
The results were announced by the NC party office nearly
midnight showing that Koirala won more than 80 percent of the
total votes in the election.
</P>
<P>
About 1,500 NC representatives from all over the country cast
their votes in the election for the party presidency, for which
three candidates including Koirala were running.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that the NC party chose its president by
ballot in its 50-year history.
</P>
<P>
The party at present leads a three-party coalition government
with its parliamentary leader Sher Bahadur Deuba as prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
After his overwhelming victory was announced, the 72-year-old
Koirala told reporters that he would make efforts to strengthen
his party's organizational work and cooperate with the coalition
government to help it complete its full term.
</P>
<P>
The NC president-elect had led a majority NC government from
1991 but was forced to step down three years later mainly due to
intra-party rivalries.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Expands Tapioca Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is seeking expansion of
its overseas tapioca markets while Russia and the Czech Republic
are to become new buyers of Thai tapioca flour.
</P>
<P>
Russia imports 250,000 tons of tapioca flour every year while
40 percent of the Czech Republic's tapioca demand is imported.
</P>
<P>
Tapioca products, an important export item of Thailand, are
suitable for many industries like latex, sweeteners and alcohol
production.
</P>
<P>
Thai tapioca products will be a substitute for potato and maize
flour which will soon be priced higher following cost rises for
grain production in the world market, which has resulted in a
reduction of subsidies by the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Belgium has agreed to allow Thailand a 10,000-ton
quota of tapioca flour at tariffs cheaper than the normal rate of
100 ECU (European Currency Units) per ton.
</P>
<P>
The European Union grants 10,500 tons of cheap duty quotas
globally to every country on a first come, first served basis.
Thailand has tried to encourage Thai exporters to use global
quotas before using the country's own quota.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Stock Exchange Index
(Phisix) has surged to a 28-month high this week as foreign and
local investors continue buying the blue chip stocks.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, bullish sentiments presided over the Philippine
stock exchange with the composite index closing at 3,014.27 points
from 2,975.56 points recorded last Friday.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time that the Phisix broke the psychological
barrier of 3,000 points.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, heavy-buying of key-index stocks caused the
Phisix to soar to an 18-month high of 3,066.05 points.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the Phisix continued to hit a 28-month high of
3,129.08 points.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that investors reacted favorably to the 11.3
percent inflation in April, which was lower than the 11.8 percent
in March.
</P>
<P>
Other factors included the strong economic and corporate growth
projections, as well as stability in the interest rates and
foreign exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
The market will now test the highest recorded closing index of
3,362.48 points registered on January 4, 1994.
</P>
<P>
Several market analysts expressed optimistic outlook for the
country's capital market this year.
</P>

level by the end of 1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI)
commander gen. Feisal Tanjung said the authority will pursue
fugitive Eddy Tansil through the Interpol network if he had
escaped abroad.
</P>
<P>
"We will pursue him until we get him. If he has managed to get
abroad, we will still go after him," Antara news agency today
quoted the commander as saying on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
If he had fled abroad, the army forces would keep up the search
through the Interpol network or journalists' help, Tanjung said,
When asked about possible difficulties in apprehending the former
businessman, who was sentenced to 20 years in jail for a 1.3
trillion (620 million U.S. dollars) loan scam.

Meanwhile, police Thursday named nine more suspects in their
investigations into the escape case, bringing the total number of

the nine suspects were members of a well-planned conspiracy that
facilitated the escape.

Tansil, the owner of the Golden Key business group, managed to
escape from a jail near Jakarta Saturday evening. Since then the

<HEADLINE> Bulgarians Commemorate Victory Against Nazi Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarians attended mass rallies all
over the country today to commemorate the 51st anniversary of the
victory over Nazi Germany in World War II, the Bulgarian Telegraph
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The victory on May 9, 1945, against Fascism was a historic day
not only for Europe but for mankind, said Velko Walkanov, chairman
of the Committee for Fighters against Fascism, at a rally in
Plovdi, Bulgaria's second biggest city.
</P>
<P>
The rally - organized by the Committee For Fighters against
Fascism, the Bulgarian Socialist Party and other bodies - was held
around a monument to Soviet troops who helped liberate Bulgaria
from Nazi Germany.
</P>
<P>
The monument was earlier the center of a controversy when the
Union of Democratic Forces of Bulgaria tried to dismantle it.
</P>
<P>
The incident prompted the Russian embassy in Sofia to present a
note to the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry, saying a few people were
attempting to undermine the friendship between the Russian and
Bulgarian peoples.
</P>
<P>
In response, the Bulgarian government said the monument would
be kept intact as it symbolized the victory of the peoples of the
two countries against Fascism.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Postal Officials Bust Child Porn Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Postal Service has shut
down what it calls the largest commercial distributor of child
pornography in U.S. history following a two-year investigation,
officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chief Postal Inspector Kenneth J. Hunter said the owner of a
San Diego-based company called "Overseas Male," was arrested,
along with 45 of his customers. Another 70 customers were
expected to be prosecuted. The man who allegedly made the porn
tapes in Mexico has committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
The investigation began in early 1994 after people complained
to the Postal Service and U.S. Customs about receiving unsolicited
video catalogs from "Overseas Male," which distributed videotapes
produced in Mexico showing children as young as 7 years old in
explicit sexual acts with adults and other children.
</P>
<P>
A few months later, company owner James Leroy Kemmish was
arrested in San Diego. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to five
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
Postal inspectors changed the company's name to Island Male and
ran it almost identically to the way Overseas Male did. As orders
from 36 states came into investigators' post office box in San
Diego, they processed and delivered them, searching the buyers'
residences once the packages were signed for.
</P>
<P>
Prosecution is in various stages for arrests resulting from the
130 searches, and at least 23 suspects were identified as having
been involved in current or past sexual abuse.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economy To Maintain Growth, Business leaders Say </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Top U.S. business leaders said
that the U.S. economy will continue to grow at a moderate pace
through 1997 with overall inflation remaining at low levels.
</P>
<P>
The Business Council, composed of chief executives from 100 of
the largest U.S. corporations, said in a latest economic forecast
that it saw no recession on the horizon, even though the current
expansion is already the second-longest peacetime recovery.
</P>
<P>
But the forecast said that the nation's total output of goods
and services, the gross domestic product (GDP), should only grow
by 2.2 percent this year and in 1997, a slight improvement from
the 2 percent increase during 1995.
</P>
<P>
Inflation at the consumer level, which has been well-behaved
for the past four years, should remain under control, the Business
Council predicted. It saw consumer prices rising by 2.9 percent
this year and 3 percent in 1997, little change from the 2.8
percent increase in 1995.
</P>
<P>
On the recently soaring gasoline prices in the United States,
business leaders blamed the increase on unusually low levels of
crude oil inventories because of heavy demand for heating oil
during the cold winter and believed it would be short-lived.
</P>
<P>
The group said the benign outlook on inflation should allow the
U.S. Federal Reserve to hold monetary policies relatively steady
over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
The economic outlook of the business executives was very
similar to the latest survey released by Blue Chip Economic
Indicators, which predicted the GDP would grow 2.1 percent this
year.
</P>
<P>
In other predictions, the Business Council said unemployment,
which averaged 5.6 percent in 1995, will remain at that level
through this year and increase only slightly to 5.7 percent in
1997.
</P>
<P>
The group said the U.S. trade deficit, which hit a seven-year
high of 111 billion dollars in 1995, should begin to show
improvement this year, narrowing to 97 billion and then declining
to 88 billion dollars in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Polls Have 50-50 Chance of Success: OSCE Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Free elections in Bosnia have a 50-50
chance of going ahead as planned in mid-September, Robert Frowick,
head of the mission of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, said today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. diplomat, who was charged with organizing the polls,
is due to make a recommendation in June as to whether polling can
go forward by the September 14 deadline set out in the Dayton
peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Among thorny issues remain to be resolved are the participation
of some 900,000 refugees who have the right to cast ballots, free
access to the media by qualified campaigners as well as the
electoral funds.
</P>
<P>
"These elections are going to be difficult and imperfect,"
Frowick said. "They are going to be the most difficult elections
held in history."
</P>
<P>
In a related development, U.S. Ambassador to Austria Swannee
Hunt said here that the mission of U.S. troops in Bosnia would not
be extended very long after it ends at the end of the year due to
a reduced budget.

VIENNA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Interior Minister Caspar
Einem told a press conference today that up to 16,000 Bosnian
refugees now in the country can stay for another year if they are

</P>
<P>
At least 30 percent of the Bosnian refugees came from the
self-styled "Serbian Republic" and their return could be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
Previously, the refugees were supposed to live in Austria until
June this year.
</P>
<P>
Einem said they now can stay here until August 1997 because
real peace has not yet been achieved in Bosnia and the refugees
need more time to prepare for their return home.

TIRANA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- U.N. special envoy in Bosnia Carl
Bildt today called on the Yugoslav government and ethnic Albanians
in Kosovo to hold talks to ease mounting tensions in the province.
</P>
<P>
Unrest in Kosovo, an autonomous province in the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia, could threaten peace in the Balkans, said
Bildt in an interview with a newspaper published in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have been increasing in Kosovo since an ethnic
Albanian student was killed there by a bomb on April 21. The next
day, five Serbs were shot dead and four wounded in a reprisal
attack. Authorities immediately arrested a group of ethnic
Albanians, worsening the situation.
</P>
<P>
Relations between ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of
Kosovo's population of two million, and Serbs have long been
tense.
</P>
<P>
Since 1989, about 150 people have died in clashes between the
two ethnic communities and in 1991, ethnic Albanians there
proclaimed an independent "Republic of Kosovo".

BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- A total of 1,050 more public
toilets have been built or renovated in the Chinese capital this
year, bringing the number of W.C.s to more than 7,000.
</P>
<P>
According to today's "Beijing Daily", these new public toilets
are more modern, and 50 more even better toilets are to be built
this year.
</P>
<P>
With its population of 12 million, and 60 million tourists,
Beijing is reported to have the largest number of toilets in the
world.
</P>
<P>
As a reflection of a city's level of culture these symbols have
aroused increasing concern about their scarcity, poor quality, and
unreasonable location, and have been a big headache for overseas
tourists and local residents alike.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government came up with a three-year plan to deal
with the matter in 1994 and more toilets have been built at
tourist sites, including the Great Wall and the Ming Tombs.
</P>
<P>
A public toilet design competition is scheduled in the capital
in early June. So far, 38 sample toilets have been put into
operation in Beijing.

<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Lushan Mountain, a scenic spot in
east China's Jiangxi Province, is on the way to a world fame, as
it is applying for a place in United Nations' "World Heritage
List", reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Two experts sent by the UN's Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization finished on-the-spot investigations of the
mountain on Wednesday, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
With support from the State Council, Lushan authorities applied
last October for inclusion on the "World Heritage List," which
names places and antiquities and relics of worldwide significance
and in need of particular protection.
</P>
<P>
Lushan has a double advantage in this evaluation, as it boasts
both cultural and natural distinctions, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
It has the most glacial remains in East Asia, and is recognized
as one of only three examples of Quaternary Period glacial traces
in the world, along with the Alps and the Rocky Mountains.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Lushan, the Yangtze River and the Poyang Lake are the
nesting grounds of the largest colony of white cranes in the world.
</P>
<P>
By June of 1994, 411 cultural and historical sites were named
to the "World Heritage List," including 16 double heritage sites
of nature and culture.
</P>
<P>
Huangshan Mountain in Anhui Province has been included on the
UN list as one of the double heritage sites.

<HEADLINE> Indian PM May Resign Today Over Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Narasimha
Rao and his cabinet may quit today because the ruling party Indian
National Congress suffered serious setbacks in the current general
elections, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Indian cabinet is scheduled to meet for the last time today
prior to resignation, bringing down the curtain on Rao's
five-year-old government which is likely to pave the way for a
coalition cabinet to take office, the PTI said.
</P>
<P>
According to the PTI, Rao met with President Shankar Dayal
Sharma last night and told him that he would resign today as the
results and trends of the parliamentary elections pointed towards
a hung parliament.
</P>
<P>
Although the counting of votes continued for the third day
today, an analysis of results of a quarter of parliamentary
constituencies showed that the Congress Party has lost more than
one seat it had held before for every seat it won this time.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the political activities in New Delhi picked up
intensity with both Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the National
Front-Left (NF-LF) combine planning to stake separate claims for
forming a government at the center.
</P>
<P>
The BJP is harping on the like-minded allies while the NF-LF
combine is wanting to thwart its moves with a rainbow alliance of
secular parties. However, the two forces have already initiated
talks with various regional parties and other obscure backbenchers
in the parliament who now hold the key to making the new
government.
</P>
<P>
Of the 288 results declared so far, the Congress was still
ahead as a single party with 94 seats, while the Bharatiya Janata
Party bagged 80, Janata Dal 22, Communist Party of India (Marxist)
7, Communist Party of India 5 and other regional groupings and
independents accounting for the rest.

<HEADLINE> China to Inspect Medicinal Foods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Public Health
has asked manufacturers of medicinal foods to apply for a licence
and have their products tested beginning next month.
</P>
<P>
Foreign companies and agencies who want to export such products
to China will also have to report to the top health authority and
receive inspections conducted by the National Food Hygiene
Inspection Institute, the "China Daily" quoted a ministerial
regulation as saying.
</P>
<P>
Medicinal foods include products that are able to adjust the
functions of human organs, yet are not targeted at specific
ailments, the report said.
</P>
<P>
There are currently more than 3,000 enterprises producing these
foods. About 3,000 varieties of such foods are on sale across the
country, but some have never been inspected, said Su Zhi, division
chief in charge of food hygiene inspection under the ministry.
</P>
<P>
"Some do not contain the nutrients described in their
advertisements or lists of ingredients," the report claimed.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has received an increasing number of letters
complaining about the quality of medicinal foods in the past
several years, it said.
</P>
<P>
The regulation, the first of its kind in the country, is
designed to standardize industrial practices in the field and
upgrade the quality fo medicinal foods to benefit consumers.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has issued a circular asking all factories
concerned to examine their working facilities, conditions and the
quality of their products over the next six months, the report
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Haikou's population has doubled to
half a million since it became the capital of the island province
of Hainan in 1988, according to the city's statistics bureau.
</P>
<P>
Hainan is China's largest special economic zone, whose flexible
policies are meant to encourage overseas investors including those
from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
An official with the statistics bureau said that the city
government has spent 1.6 billion yuan on infrastructure
construction since 1988. As a result, Haikou's urban area has
grown to 40 sq km from 18 sq km, and total floor space has doubled
to 13.58 million sq m.
</P>
<P>
On average, Haikou's airport handles 100 flights daily, the
official said, adding that the city is linked by 51 air routes to
200 major cities in China and four air routes to Hong Kong and
southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
There are now 42.5 telephones for every 100 Haikou residents,
more than any other provincial capital city in China.
</P>
<P>
"The city government has always paid close attention to urban
planning and environmental protection," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, 78 km of sewage pipelines have been
laid, a number of sewage treatment plants built, and 1.13 million
trees and 1.83 million sq m of lawn planted.
</P>
<P>
As a result, tree coverage in urban areas has risen to 37.7
percent and per-capita green space to 8.3 sq m.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Beats Slovakia 2-1 in Exhibition Match </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Klas Ingesson scored on a shot
from close range that deflected off a defender with only five
minutes left to give Sweden a 2-1 victory over Slovakia in a
soccer exhibition in Helsingborg, Sweden on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The victory extended the unbeaten streak to 12 games for coach
Tommy Svensson's side.
</P>
<P>
Martin Dahlin, one of the top scorers in the German Bundesliga
with Borussia Moenchengladbach this season, opened the scoring in
the 51st minute. It was his 24th goal for Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Par Zetterberg, who came on for Jonas Thern in midfield after
the break, set up the goal. Zetterberg, who has played nine years
for Anderlecht and Charleroi in Belgium but seldom used on the
national team, also had two powerful shots blocked by goalie
Ladislav Molnar.
</P>
<P>
Bari's Kennet Andersson, one of Sweden's goalscoring heroes in
the 1994 World Cup finals in the United States, and Dahlin also had
excellent scoring opportunities later in the half.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Marian Zeman tied it in the 65th minute after Anders
Limpar had left the Slovakian defender unmarked on the left side.
</P>
<P>
Limpar left the field nine minutes later and was replaced by
Henrik Larsson, playing his first game here since he transfered
from Helsingborg to Feyenoord in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Substitute Vladislav Zvara came close late in the match,
watched by 10,798 fans at Olympia Stadium, when his left-foot
drive hit Swedish backup goalie Bengt Andersson's crossbar.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Ravelli, the most capped goalkeeper in the world, did
not play because of an injury.
</P>
<P>
It was the first home game of the season for Sweden, which
finished third in the 1994 World Cup finals but surprisingly
failed to qualify for next month's European Championship finals in
England.
</P>
<P>
Sweden faces Belarus June 1 in Stockholm in its first qualifier
for the 1998 World Cup finals in France.

<HEADLINE> China's Petrochemical Giant to Have 20 Billion Yuan in Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai Petrochemical plans to
raise its annual sales to 20 billion yuan and gross profits to
five billion yuan in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Ranked first in China's petrochemical sector, Shanghai
Petrochemical notched up 12.06 billion yuan in sales and 3.6
billion yuan in gross profits last year.
</P>
<P>
Over the previous three years, its gross profit soared by 96.4
percent, 71.6 percent and 47.4 percent, respectively, a record
rarely seen in the world's petrochemical industry.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Petrochemical issued A shares, strictly for domestic
investors, and B shares, targeted at overseas investors, on the
Shanghai bourse, and floated B shares in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
To realize its grand goal, Shanghai Petrochemical is expected
to pour 4.7 billion yuan into 11 major technical renovation
projects to produce more products with high profit margins over
the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Seven of the projects have been approved by the government and
are under construction, and feasibility research is being carried
out for the other four.
</P>
<P>
The seven projects will raise Shanghai Petrochemical's annual
output of ethylene to 550,000 tons, that of propylene to 200,000
tons, install production lines to turn out more polyester fiber
and polypropylene fiber, build a 10,000-ton holder for
liquefied-ethylene, and construct a 75,000-ton dock.
</P>
<P>
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000), Shanghai
Petrochemical will invest more than 10 billion yuan in its
expansion program, which will enable it to produce one million
tons of ethylene and one million tons of synthetic fiber annually
by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Petrochemical will make use of its own funds, and will
use loans from banks, and raise funds on international capital
markets for the expansion program.

a showdown against Swiss teenager Martina Hingis in the
quarter-finals of the Italian Open tennis tournament after
straight sets victory here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
On a day when rain delayed the action for four-and-a-half
hours, Graf needed barely an hour to dispatch Argentina's Paola
Suarez 6-2, 6-4, while sixth-seeded Hingis beat Italy's Sandra
Cecchini 6-2, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Graf was impressive in the first set but her game went awry in
the second as she surrendered a 3-0 lead and allowed Suarez to
level at 3-3.
</P>
<P>
The turning point came in the seventh game when world No.1 made
a decisive break for 4-3, allowing her to serve out for the
match. She clinched the win when Suarez netted a backhand return.
</P>
<P>
Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, winner of last week's Hamburg
tournament, had a fright before continuing her unbeaten run with
a 7-6 (7/5), 6-2 victory over Argentina's Bettina Fulco Villella.
</P>
<P>
The third seeded Spaniard trailed 3-5 in the first set and
faced the Argentine's serve in the ninth, before raising her game
to make the vital break for 4-5.
</P>
<P>
She served out to square the set at 5-5, but the erratic
performance continued in the tie-break as she needed four set
points before finally pulling through.
</P>
<P>
After losing serve in the opening game in the second set,
Sanchez Vicario immediately broke back, held serve and broke
again to love as she accelerated into a 4-1 lead and on to
victory.
</P>
<P>
She now meets Romanian Irina Spirlea in the last eight.
</P>
<P>
Fellow Spaniard Conchita Martinez, who is looking to win this
tournament for the fourth year in succession, opens Friday's
programme against Magdalena Maleeva.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian was a 6-7 (4/7), 6-1, 6-4 winner on Thursday over
Austrian Judith Wiesner, the ninth seed.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Posts $1.846 Billion Trade Surplus in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Mexico had a 1.846 billion
U.S. dollars trade surplus while registering the highest exporting
volume during the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Finance and Public Credit Ministry today, the
January-March period was the fifth quarter in a row with a
positive result in the balance of trade.
</P>
<P>
Mexico's total exports during the first three months of the
year reached 21.781 billion dollars, the highest quarterly level
in the country's foreign trade history.
</P>
<P>
Exports of manufactured products were 17.938 billion dollars, a
20.5 percent increase over the same period of 1995; and those of
oil were 2.451 billion dollars, a 23.3 percent rise.
</P>
<P>
However, agricultural and livestock exports were 1.283 billion
dollars, down 28.1 percent from the same period of last year, due
to adverse weather conditions in some regions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, total imports amounted to 19.935 billion dollars, a
9.6 percent rise over the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican Finance and Public Credit Secretariat attributed
the quarterly import increase to the bigger demand of intermediate
goods by national industry.

<HEADLINE> Schaller Beats Becker in German Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Schaller of Austria surprised
top-seeded Boris Becker with a 6-2, 6-2 victory in the third round
of the German Open in Hamburg on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian stunned Pete Sampras in the first round of the
French Open last year and is always dangerous on the slower
courts that Becker detests.
</P>
<P>
Becker, winner of the Australian Open title in January, prefers
a fast court and sunshine to the heavy and overcast conditions he
experienced on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The German failed to adapt his game both to either the surface
or the abilities of his opponent. The German played serve and
volley tennis -- often to little effect -- and was little short of
suicidal in the number of times he came to the net only to see a
Schaller passing shot flash by him.
</P>
<P>
Former finalist Yevgeny Kafelnikov, seeded third, dropped the
second set against Carlos Moya of Spain but the Russian rallied
to win 6-3, 2-6, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Sixth-seed Sergi Bruguera overcame fellow Spaniard Jordi
Burillo 6-2, 7-6 (7/5), and fifth-seeded Marcelo Rios of Chile
comfortably overcame last week's Munich champion, Slava Dosedel,
6-3, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
South African Wayne Ferreira, seeded fourth, progressed 6-4,
6-3 at the expense of 14th-seeded Dutchman Richard Krajicek.
</P>
<P>
Two other seeds also fell. Frenchman Arnaud Boetsch, seeded
No.7, was beaten 6-4, 6-1 by qualifier Roberto Carretero of Spain,
and 8th-seeded Marc Rosset of Switzerland lost 6-3, 6-2 against
another Spaniard, Alex Corretja.
</P>
<P>
The quarter-final line-up wil take Schaller against Carretero,
Kafelnikov against Bruguera, Rios against Ferreira and Corretja
against Magnus Larsson of Sweden.

<HEADLINE> Water Wasters Punished in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,700 householders in
China's capital of Beijing have been fined 785,000 yuan for
wasting precious water since 1995..
</P>
<P>
Beijing is gradually marching towards its goal of becoming a
water-saving city thanks to great efforts made by local government
departments and people from all walks of life.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Beijing saved 60.66 million cubic meters
of water in 1995, including 15.56 million cubic meters of running
water, 6.82 million cubic meters of private well water and 34
million cubic meters of river water.
</P>
<P>
More than 84 percent of water for industrial use was re-cycled,
and 13,200 hectares of farmland fed with sprinkler or drip
irrigation systems.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has always been a city short of water. With the
increase in population, the per capita water quota reduced from
former 400 cubic meters to 300 cubic meters, much lower than the
world's average.
</P>
<P>
Local governments have promoted knowledge about water
preservation and have set up water-saving systems in various local
units.

WASHINGTON, May 9 (Xinhua) -- China defeated the United States
3-1 in the opening of four-match women's volleyball series
Wednesday night in southern California.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese girls scored 7-15, 15-12, 15-10 and 15-6 in the
four sets at Bren Events Center on the University of California
Irvine Campus.
</P>
<P>
Team USA cruised to an easy win in the first set, and was
comfortably ahead in the second. But China suddenly came to life,
digging seemingly everything hit over the net and scoring points
in transition.
</P>
<P>
Contributing to the victory, Outside hitter Sun Yue, who was
named to the 1995 FIVB Wold All-Star Team, helped lead the
comeback and finished with a team-high 18 kills. Teammate Wang Yi
contributed eight kills and led a potent Chinese block with four
stuffs.
</P>
<P>
"They started digging a lot of balls and playing very well,"
said USA head coach Terry Liskevych. "But we didn't keep up with
them by stepping up our game. Bottom line, we didn't play wel
after the second game."
</P>
<P>
On the American side, USA captain and outside hitter Tammy
Liley was the kill leader of the match, with 20. Sisters Elaina
and Bev Oden tied for the U.S. blocking honors, with four stuffs
apiece.

<HEADLINE> Anhui Trains Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, May 10 (Xinhua) -- A large-scale program to train
farmers was launched early this year in east China's Anhui
Province, one of the major agricultural bases in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, by the year 2000 the province will try
to train all young farm workers and five million employees in
township enterprises.
</P>
<P>
By then, one farmer out of 25 to 30 households will hold a
"green certificate", issued nationwide for farmer training, and
every village will have three to five agricultural technicians.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that there is one agricultural technician for
every 200 ha of arable land in the country, on average. But in
Anhui there is only one for every 300 ha.
</P>
<P>
Because of a scarcity of agrotechnicians 70 percent of
agricultural technological findings cannot be promoted on a large
scale, and the average per ha output of grain in the province is
750 kg lower than in surrounding provinces.
</P>
<P>
The training plan will give importance to the setting up of an
all-round agro-technique service network in the province.
</P>
<P>
Graduates of middle- and high schools who fail to pass
examinations for further education will be trained in practical
agricultural techniques, according to the plan.
</P>
<P>
Preferential loans and other types of support will be available
for those who gain "green certificates".

BELGRADE, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb Representatives today
signed agreements with representatives of U.S. agency PMG Barenc
and with Swiss agency Interkem on extending assistance to the
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
The aid would mainly be put on privatization, rebuilding the
power supply network, industries, roads repair and on health care
in the Serb state Republika Srpska, Tanjug news agency said.

Milojevic, and the Minister of Health Care, Labor and Welfare,
Dragan Kalinic.

Serb President Radovan Karadzic, who attended the signing
ceremony, said he hoped the two eminent world agencies will help
the Serbs establish a market economy, modern health care and
infrastructure systems.

LONDON, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The British goernment today defeated
a cross-party Commons bid to lift the ban on homosexuals serving
in the British armed forces, according to a BBC TV report today.
</P>
<P>
The move, which was sponsored by Edwina Currie, a former
cabinet minister in the ruling Conservative Party, was defeated by
188 votes to 120, leaving the government with a majority of 68.
</P>
<P>
Currie argued that the ban was based on "prejudice, pure and
simple".
</P>
<P>
But service chiefs and defence ministers believed that to lift
the ban on homosexuals would damage morale and the operational
effectiveness of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
At present, while overt homosexuals are dismissed from the
British armed services, those who do not disclose their sexuality
have been able to continue their careers.

</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Qin said that the Security Council
discussed the U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's

</P>
<P>
"The council members expressed deep concern at the worsening

</P>
<P>
The U.N. secretary-general put forward a report on the
situation in Burundi on May 3. The report noted that the security
situation in Burundi has continued to deteriorate and tension
remains high as Hutu armed bands are intensifying their attacks
throughout the country. The Burundian Army has reponded vigorously
to these attacks. Civilian casualties caused by both sides are
reported to be high and over 100,000 have been displaced as a
result.

<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, May 9 (Xinhua) -- UN High Commissioner For Refugees
Sadako Ogata on Thursday scaled down the possible repatriation of
of Bosnian refugees for 1996 to almost half of the level she
predicted earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Ogata, who was near the end of her trip throughout Bosnia, said
at a press conference here that only 70,000 out of more than two
million refugees or displaced persons have returned since the end
of the war, but almost exclusively to places where their ethnics
are in majority.
</P>
<P>
"It is a very difficult job to really return refugees," Ogata
said, referring to blocking the return of refugees by the former
warring factions to their controlled areas.
</P>
<P>
The UN refugee agency has set a "working target" of
repatriating 900,000 Bosnian refugees for this year, Ogata said,
adding that "I am quite aware that the real number will be far
less, half a million will be the best".
</P>
<P>
The difficulty of return of refugees was highlighted on
Thursday by the incident in the village of Donje Rjecica, near the
northern Bosnia town of Maglaj.

<HEADLINE> World Community Urged to Stop Rapid Loss of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW York, May 9 (Xinhua) -- A two-week-long environmental
leaders forum ended here today, calling on the world community to
take urgent actions to stop the rapid loss of biodiversity on the
globe.
</P>
<P>
A formal declaration on the state of biodiversity on the planet
was signed by the participants from China, Brazil, Belize, Costa
Rica, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Peru, Sri lanka, Tanzania, St.
Lucia, Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
The declaration, or a call for action, read out at the news
briefing in Columbia University, called on all nations that have
not yet signed the Convention on Biological Diversity, including
the United States, to join the world community, ratify this treaty
and take action in its implementation at all levels.
</P>
<P>
It said, "four years after the signing of the Convention on
Biological Diversity(Rio, June 1992), we still face the rapid loss
of biological diversity, the non-sustainable use of these
fundmental natural resources, and the lack of partnerships for
equitable distribution of their resulting benefits."
</P>
<P>
"We do not have time to lose in meeting our obligations to
present and future generations," it stressed.
</P>
<P>
For this sake, the declaration called for increased funding for
important conservation projects, more widespread development of
strategic management plans for natural protected areas and the
extension of those plans beyond already protected areas, better
access for wildlife managers and government policy-makers to the
latest academic research, greater investment by governments in
training and education concerning environmental protection and
creation of more mechanisms to ensure that existing environmental
legislation is enforced.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Denies Involvement in Illegal Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
flatly denied in a videotaped testimony presented in the
Whitewater trial in Little Rock, Arkansas, on Thursday that he had
ever pressured key Whitewater witness David Hale to make any loans
to defendants in the case.
</P>
<P>
The videotape showed Clinton answering questions from defense
attorneys and prosecutors as he sat in a chair in the Map Room of
the White House, according to media reports.
</P>
<P>
In the testimony videotaped on April 28, and was not made
public until Thursday, Clinton responded to Hale's allegations
that he was pressured by Clinton, who was then Arkansas governor,
to make an illegal loan of 300,000 dollars to defendants.
</P>
<P>
"I did not put any pressure on David Hale," Clinton said. "Any
suggestion I tried to get money, or keep anything secret, or put
pressure -- these things are not true. It just didn't happened."
</P>
<P>
Clinton smiled and appeared at ease as he was questioned by
defense attorneys who subpoenaed him to testify for McDougal, his
former wife, Susan, and Arkansas Governor Jim Guy Tucker, the
defendants in the federal fraud and conspiracy trial.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, were partners
with the McDougals in the ill-fated Whitewater development in
northern Arkansas, which has given its name to the independent
counsel's investigation.
</P>
<P>
The Clintons have not been charged in the case.
</P>
<P>
The McDougals and Tucker are accused of fraud and conspiracy in
obtaining illegal loans at Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan and
at Capital Management Services. McDougal ran Madison and Hale ran
Capital Management.

<HEADLINE> New York Stocks Edged Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Stocks managed slight gains today
after trailing lower as interest rates rose and investors grew
anxious about Friday's report on inflation.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 1.08 points to
5,475.14. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 4 to 3
on the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,335 up, 995 down and 802
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume totaled 403.71 million shares, down from 427.81
million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index rose 0.63 to 346.61. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.66 to 645.44.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 4.11 to 1,187.54.
</P>
<P>
At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose
0.63 to 346.61.
</P>
<P>
Today, bonds moved lower and the yield on 30-year Treasuries
edged above 7 percent after hovering at 6.99 percent for most of
the session.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the Dow and broader blue-chip indexes have been
struggling in recent weeks amid inflation worries and the
persistent rise of interest rates, which threatens corporate
profit growth and makes bonds an increasingly attractive
investment.
</P>
<P>
Despite the rise in interest rates today, broad stock measures
were positive.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts had expected a slight increase in last week's
claims. The current range may indicate continuing modest job
growth.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Defends U.S. Backing to Israeli Shelling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton today
defended the U.S. backing to recent Israeli military attacks at a
U.N. civilian refugee camp in southern Lebanon, alleging that the
U.S. support would not undermine America's broker role in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"The people in the Arab world will look at what we have
done...and I think they will see that the United States has been
fair and honest," Clinton said during a joint press conference
with visiting Greek President Constantinos Staephanopoulos at the
White House.
</P>
<P>
More and more Arab nations have reportedly been complaining
about the U.S. support to the Israeli shelling of the refugee camp
which killed more than 90 civilians.
</P>
<P>
"People make mistakes in wartime," Clinton alleged. "There is no
such thing as perfect weapons" in the age of high technology on
the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Greek-Turkish disputes over territorial waters and
airspace in the Aegean Sea, the U.S. president said he hoped to
undertake a new initiative this year to end the longstanding
disputes between the two U.S. NATO allies.
</P>
<P>
"We do not favour any threats of the use of force," the
president said. "I don't expect there to be situation where force
comes into play. I think wisdom will prevail over passion."
