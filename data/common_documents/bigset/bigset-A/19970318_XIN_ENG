<HEADLINE> Roundup: Manila Declares All-Out War Against Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
recently declared an all-out war against organized crimes
including kidnappings, bank robbery, drug trafficking and other
illegal activities in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a handwritten directive issued on March 14, Ramos ordered
Secretary of Interior and Local Governments Robert Barbers to
intensify the anti-kidnap, anti-crime drive by utilizing the
entire criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
Ramos also ordered the Philippine National Police (PNP), the
Department of National Defense, the Armed Forces of the
Philippines, the Department of Justice and the National Bureau of
Investigation to provide all necessary assistance to Secretary
Barbers.
</P>
<P>
The president told the PNP to disband all private armed groups,
thereby gathering, collecting and accounting for all unlicensed
firearms. He also directed the national police to coordinate more
closely with all intelligence agencies to ensure the success of
the anti-crime campaign.
</P>
<P>
The president also emphasized that he wants a community network
firmly established and mobilized as a preventive strategy in the
campaign against all forms of lawlessness and as a tool for the
arrest and prosecution of criminals.
</P>
<P>
He added the community, one of the pillars of the justice
system, must be tapped in gathering information against kidnappers
and other suspicious characters.
</P>
<P>
President Ramos declared the nationwide war against crimes
after a prestigious magazine of the United States recently
published a story about the seriousness of the kidnapping problem
in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Fortune, a publication widely read by executives of the world's
biggest corporations, reported in an article entitled
"Philippines' Kidnapping Problem Spreads" that 241 people were
kidnapped for ransom in 1996, nearly double the official figure a
year before.
</P>
<P>
The figure was estimated 40 times more than in Thailand, a
country with roughly the same population, the story said, adding
that kidnap victims were convinced that some bad military and
police officers are kidnappers themselves or protectors of
kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
Fortune also revealed that wealthy Filipino-Chinese are no
longer the only target to be abducted, Filipinos or foreigners now
are also not immune in the country.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the article quoted Philippine Vice President
Joseph Estrada as saying that kidnapping statistics are "greatly
understated" because many victims are too frightened to report to
the police.
</P>
<P>
The story touched off a heated debate in the Philippines. Press
Secretary Hector Villanueva disputed it as "unfair and baseless"
while expressing President Fidel Ramos' resentment at the story.
</P>
<P>
The PNP also flatly denied the report. It said that the crime
rate in the country has dropped by nine percent since 1990,
attracting more foreign investments to spur the growth of the
national economy.
</P>
<P>
Some crime-watch groups, however, said the actual situation in
the country is "much worse" than reported. They revealed that a
total of 179 kidnapping cases happened and 22 of the victims died
last year. For the first two months this year, 41 kidnapping
incidents have been documented.
</P>
<P>
But what is important now is that the Philippine government has
begun to take actions. Following Ramos' order, the Presidential
Anti-crime Commission submitted a bill before the Congress for
approval over the weekend, proposing the passage of a law making
non-reporting of kidnap incidents and non-cooperation on the part
of the victims' families be considered a crime.
</P>
<P>
To stop kidnappings, the bill also recommended imposing
stricter penalty; prohibiting the use of heavily tinted car
windows which are often used by kidnappers as protection; allowing
law enforcers as the only persons authorized to possess or carry
firearms and permitting policemen to arrest kidnapping suspects
even without warrants.
</P>
<P>
The PNP will also hold a consultative meeting on March 20 with
leaders of the Congress and representatives from all walks of life
to map out some key strategies for the coming battle against
crimes.
</P>
<P>
President Ramos' commitment to fighting against crimes received
a warm welcome across the country. The Filipinos expressed
optimism that the Ramos administration would win the war if all
government agencies take concerted and resolute actions.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Appoints New First Deputy PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
appointed Boris Nemtsov, governor of the Nizhny Novgorod region,
the first deputy prime minister today.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin made the offer to 37-year-old Nemtsov when he met him
in the Kremlin, where Yeltsin praised Nemtsov as a man who was
"experienced, had authority and is capable."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin was expected to announce the revamped government before
he heads to Helsinki, Finland, for a summit with President Clinton
on Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
Nemtsov has won praise as a dynamic governor of the Nizhny
Novgorod region near Moscow, turning the territory into a
laboratory for economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
The area has been used for a variety of pilot projects, with
the World Bank and other international institutions, involving
privatization and enterprise reforms.
</P>
<P>
Nemtsov would handle social welfare policy and the
restructuring of government monopolies such as natural gas and
electricity, Yeltsin said in an interview with several television
networks.
</P>
<P>
With Russia suffering from a host of economic and social
problems, Yeltsin ordered a sweeping government shakeup last
week. But so far, Yeltsin has named only two people to new posts
-- Nemtsov, and Anatoly Chubais, 41, who will also hold the title
of first deputy prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president asked Nemtsov to join hands with
Chernomyrdin and Chubais to form a young and capable new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
"Two young men -- you and Anatoly Chubais -- create a fresh
young team in the government -- from scratch. No one (else) has
been appointed yet," Yeltsin was quoted by Interfax as saying.
</P>
<P>
Interfax said Nemtsov had accepted the offer and would return
to his home region on the Volga River to make a formal
announcement.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Yeltsin announced that the new cabinet would have
only one first deputy prime minister and seven vice-premiers, a
lower rank.
</P>
<P>
His remarks, made during a meeting with media chiefs, were
widely seen as a sign of protracted bargaining between
Chernomyrdin and Chubais over the extent of their control over the
government.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin was due to meet Chernomyrdin and Chubais later Tuesday
to discuss the government reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
Nemtsov was born in October 1959. A physics graduate, he
worked for more than 10 years at a radio and physics institute.
He has been governor of the Nizhny Novgorod region since 1991.

<HEADLINE> Khamenei Announces Makeup of Expediency Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Supreme Leader Ali
Khamenei today announced the new makeup of Iran's Committee to
Determine the Expediency of the Islamic Order headed by President
Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
The committee is composed of 25 members, including noted
theologians and high-ranking government officials, the state-run
Tehran Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The committee is one of the most important and powerful
political organs of the Islamic regime, which was first brought
into existence by the late Iranian spiritual leader Ruhollah
Khomeini in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the decree announced by Khamenei
could be interpreted into a signal that Rafsanjani's position in
the Islamic regime is confirmed as No. 2 man just after Khamenei
even though Rafsanjani steps down as president after two-term
service in the office this August.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the new composition of the committee would
also pave the way for Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri
to have greater possibility of winning the 7th presidential
election scheduled for May 23.
</P>
<P>
The committee has the responsibility of arbitrating disputes
between Parliament and the Guardian Council. It also decides
about the general outlines of Iran's domestic and foreign
policies as well as proposing solution for the country's major
problems.
</P>
<P>
In his decree, Khamenei announced his decision to expand the
present makeup of membership of the organ with additional
"officials, statesmen and prominent theologians" to respond to
the needs of Iran at the present time.
</P>
<P>
However, the report gave no details about how many new
members have entered the committee and who have been removed from
it. The appointed 25 members will serve for a period of five
years.
</P>
<P>
Based on the decree, active in the organ are heads of the
three branches of the regime, ranking theologians of the
Guardian Council as well as ministers or directors of government
agencies.

<HEADLINE> Over 2000 Journalists Gather to Cover US-Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Helsinki, March 17 (Xinhua) -- More than 2100 journalists,
technicians are gathering here to cover the summit between U.S.
President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin here on
March 20-21.
</P>
<P>
Half of the accredited journalists are from the Finnish media,
and the others are from various countries in the world, a Finnish
official told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 700 news agencies, newspapers, magazines, TV and radios
from around the world will report the historical summit, Antti
Kuusela, first secretary of the Finnish Foreign Ministry, told
Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
Finland, which hosted the 1990 summit between former Soviet
Union President Mikhail Gorbachev and his then U.S. counterpart
George Bush, spent a budget of nearly five million Finnish marks
(about one million U.S. dollars) solely for the press covering
Yeltsin-Clinton summit.
</P>
<P>
Ilkka Rautakivi, a technician for the summit, told Xinhua that
40 kilometers optical fiber cables have been installed for the
press.
</P>
<P>
He said that more than 1,000 mobile telephones will be provided
for three press centers, one of which is specially for TV and
radios. At least 70 pentium-200HZ computers are free for
journalists to use.
</P>
<P>
The presidential summit, the 11th between presidents of Russia
and the U.S., had been scheduled on Wednesday and Thursday, but
postponed one day later due to Clinton's knee injury.
</P>
<P>
The summit was described by Western media as a meeting between
two "invalids". Clinton will be on crutches or in a wheelchair to
the summit while Yeltsin just recovered from his heart by-pass
surgery. The summit was widely regarded as the most important one
between Russia and the U.S. after the end of the Cold War since it
may open a new chapter of the U.S.-Russian relations.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian First PM Warning About King's Abdication </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's First Prime
Minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, warned today that if King
Norodom Sihanouk really abdicates, Cambodia will plunge into
trouble.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh said: "I have repeated many times that if my father
abdicates, there will be trouble in the political situation in
Cambodia."
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh described the King's intended abdication as
"unrealistic," and said he "does not believe it."
</P>
<P>
King Sihanouk made his intention of abdication known in a
bulletin released by the royal palace on February 26. It said he
was "seriously envisaging abdicating without intending to go to
live in another country."
</P>
<P>
The Prince also said if the King gave up the throne, his
Funcinpec party would have no choice but to join the King.
"Ninety percent of people in the country will join him," he added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the General Elections scheduled for 1998,
Ranariddh said that "nobody has the right to cancel them."
</P>
<P>
"Only a two-thirds majority vote by the National Assembly can
decide whether to postpone or cancel the elections," he said.
</P>
<P>
Second Prime Minister Hun Sen said Saturday that if the King
abdicated from the throne, both regional and national elections
must be cancelled.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 17 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian woman was sentenced to
death and her Vietnamese mother was jailed for life by a Hanoi
court today for trafficking in heroin.
</P>
<P>
Nguyen Thi Hiep, a 40-year-old naturalized Canadian and her
71-year-old mother, Tran Thi Cam, were arrested last April at
Hanoi airport as they checked in for a flight to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
They were carrying 5.45 kilograms of heroin, packed in small
bags and hidden behind five lacquer paintings in their luggage,
court officials said.
</P>
<P>
The court also fined the 40-year-old Canadian woman one billion
dong (86,000 U.S. dollars) and her 70-year-old mother 500 million
dong (43,000 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The two had 15 days to appeal against the sentences.
</P>
<P>
Under Vietnamese law, trafficking with as little as one
kilogram of heroin is punishable by death.
</P>
<P>
Hiep, who was reported by local newspapers to have left Vietnam
in 1982 and gained Canadian nationality in 1985, is the fourth
foreigner to receive the death sentence for drug-related crimes in
Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe on Alert for Letter Bombs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 16 (xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Posts and
Telecommunications Corporation (PTC) has been put on alert for
letter bombs allegedly being sent to U.S. targets throughout the
world including Zimbabwe, the Sunday Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
The letter bombs are believed to be coming from Egyptian
terrorists but an official at the Egyptian embassy in Harare said
joint efforts by Egyptian and American security agents to trace
the origin of the letters in Cairo were not successful.
</P>
<P>
He said this was being done by people bent on tarnishing
Egypt. "But these people are forging Egyptian stamps and postal
marks. It's very easy to forge these things and make them appear
authentic. Evidence shows that nothing was coming out of Cairo,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he confirmed that the letter bombs were being
targeted at Americans and most of the bombs were sent to New York
and one had exploded at a New York newspaper office, injuring two
people who were trying to open or examine the letters.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials within the PTC confirmed to the Sunday Mail
that a warning has been sent out by the Switzerland-based
Universal Postal Union for all postal centers to look out for the
letter bombs.
</P>
<P>
The PTC security department has been on alert and all mail
with Egyptian postal marks or stamps is being treated with
extreme caution and subjected to "extensive security testing",
they said.

PARIS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- France today again appealed on all
the players involved in the crisis of Zaire to support the peace
plan of the United Nations special envoy for the Great Lakes
region, Mohamed Sahnoun, which calls for an immediate ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
"We persist in hoping that all the parties will end up
rallying themselves around the plan of Mr. Sahnoun," said French
Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
He said that France continued to support the approach of
Sahnoun "as pursuit of military confrontations will bring about
nothing but destruction."
</P>
<P>
Zairean rebels took the strategic city of Kisangani last
Saturday and are preparing to capture Lubumbashi, the capital of
the mineral-rich province of Shaba in southern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman refused to comment on the health situation of
Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko, who was hospitalized in Monaco
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
But he pointed out that "the health of President Mobutu is a
subject of supplementary preoccupation in the Zairean crisis."

He also refused to comment on a statement made by Belgian
Foreign Minister Erik Derijcke that there would not be a solution
for the war in Zaire without taking into account the role of the

<HEADLINE> Record 561 Foreign Banks Have Branches in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The number of foreign banks in
London continued to increase sharply in 1996, with a record total
of 561 having branches, subsidiaries or representative offices,
reflecting the growth of London as a financial center.
</P>
<P>
An annual survey by Noel Alexander, a London-based banking
consultancy, showed that there was a net increase of 20 overseas
banks in London last year, with 16 leaving and 36 moving in.
</P>
<P>
There were 14 overseas banks which opened substantial
operations, meaning branches or subsidiaries as opposed to
representative offices, last year compared with eight in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Growth was particularly strong among European banks, with 28
moving in and seven moving out.
</P>
<P>
There was also a sharp influx of Russian banks, nine of which
opened representative offices in 1996, with only two leaving the
city.
</P>
<P>
The number of US banks is slowly increasing once again after a
decline in the 1980s, with Prudential-Bache International opening
operations here last year and shifting its overseas headquarters
to London from Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
The survey said that among the 561 foreign banks now in London,
53 are US and 249 are European.

<HEADLINE> EU Approves German, France EMU Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- European Union finance ministers
on Monday approved German and French economic convergency plans
and reaffirmed their belief that the Economic and Monetary
Union(EMU) would start on time in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"They were both convincing to their colleagues that they would
meet the goals of the EMU convergence criteria," Dutch finance
minister Gerrit Zalm told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
The ministers, facing mounting speculation of a delay to the
launch of a single currency, had been considering the credibility
of the two countries' EMU plans.
</P>
<P>
Their meeting comes amid record unemployment in Germany, and
doubts over whether Bonn itself could strictly adhere to the
budgetary targets outlined in the Maastricht Treaty.
</P>
<P>
"Both programs are based on realistic and credible
assumptions," EU Commissioner for monetary affairs Yves-Thibault
de Silguy said.
</P>
<P>
Germany and France also assured the other 13 EU countries their
commitment to take additional measures in case they stray from
their budgetary plan during 1997, the year when they will be
judged for EMU fitness.
</P>
<P>
The new German convergence plan provides for average GDP(Gross
Domestic Product) growth of 2.5 percent, inflation of 1.5 percent
and a 6.2 percent yield on long-term government bonds.
</P>
<P>
As concerns the budget deficit, German authorities are
determined to bring it down to 2.5 percent of GDP in 1998 and 1.5
percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
De debt, meanwhile, will reach something like 60 percent of
GDP. In 1997, it will hit 61.5 percent, compared to 60.2 percent
in 1996. During the following years, the German debt is expected
to fall and to reach 59.7 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The French program assumes GDP growth of 2.3 percent in 1997
and 2.5 percent on an annual basis between 1998 and 2001.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Women Still Marginalized: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe will not develop as long
as women are marginalized and denied access to land and credit to
start their own businesses, a senior government official has
said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a function to celebrate International Women's Day
on Sunday, Secretary for National Affairs, Employment Creation
and Cooperatives Ministry Tendai Bare-Machirori said there is
need to intensify efforts to economically empower women and
eradicate poverty in the country.
</P>
<P>
She said since women constitute more than half of Zimbabwe's
population of 11 million people, they are an important human
resource base and excluding them from positions of power would
retard development of society.
</P>
<P>
She said her ministry would soon come up with a three-year
project to help women enter politics.
</P>
<P>
The project is aimed at increasing participation of all women
in political life, and particular focus would be on this year's
urban females to pave the way for the general elections in the
year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe, S. Africa Agree on Duty Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe and South Africa have
agreed to scrap duty on most agricultural exports, paving the way
for increased exports by Zimbabwe to its largest trading partner.
</P>
<P>
Co-Chairman of the Agricultural Committee formed last year to
negotiate tariffs on all primary agricultural products, Dave
Hasluck said today it was agreed Zimbabwe would have duty-free
access to such products as beef, poultry, pork and mutton.
</P>
<P>
However, such agricultural products as vegetables, cut flowers
and sub-tropical fruits were excluded from the agreement because
they did not fall within the 1964 trade pact which Zimbabwe and
South Africa were currently re-negotiating.
</P>
<P>
Hasluck said three agreements -- on tariffs, phytosanitary
arrangements and veterinary controls -- had been reached by the
Agricultural Committee and these should be ready for submission
for formal signing before the end of this month.

<P>
LONDON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The total number of recorded
crimes in Britain fell 1.3 percent last year, the fourth drop in a
row, but violent crime rose 11 percent, according to the Home
Office Monday.
</P>
<P>
Police recorded 5,033,800 crimes in 1996 compared with
5,100,200 the year before, Home Office figures reveal today.
</P>
<P>
Home Secretary Michael Howard said the figures showed the tide
of rising crime was turning and underlined the ruling Conservative
Party's reputation for being tough on crime.
</P>
<P>
However, the main opposition Labor Party claimed that crime had
actually doubled since the Conservatives came to power in 1979.
And the Liberal Democratic Party also accused Tories of cutting
the number of police.

<HEADLINE> All Is Ready for All-Africa Trade Fair, Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria today urged countries in
the world to participate in the All-African Trade Fair it will
host at the end of this month, saying that all preparations have
been made.
</P>
<P>
Rear Admiral Jibrila Ayinla, Minister of Commerce and Tourism,
announced here that all facilities are ready at the Kaduna
International Trade Fair Complex in northern Nigeria for the
event, which is jointly sponsored by the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) and African Economic Community (AEC).
</P>
<P>
The organizing committee under the ministry has made
significant progress in areas, like logistics and protocol,
provision of medical facilities, security and publicity, for the
successful hosting of the fair, he said.
</P>
<P>
The fair, officially known as the 7th OAU/AEC All-Africa Trade
and Tourism Fair, is aimed at providing a forum for the exchange
and dissemination of information on intro-African trade.
</P>
<P>
"It is believed that the potential for intra-Africa trade can
be immediately developed by concerted efforts to exchange facts,
ideas and existing resources through an appropriate forum like
the one provided by the All-Africa Trade Fair," the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, "as big brother, Nigeria should pull other African
countries along together to boost trade and tourism," he told
newsmen at a forum.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, 20 OAU member states and about 100
multi-national companies, including such big company as General
Motors of the United States, have booked their stands at the
fair. Some of them are installing pavilions for their exhibits.
</P>
<P>
He called on all OAU member states, the international business
community and collaborating international agencies to "actively
and effectively" participate in the fair, which will be declared
open by Nigeria's Head of State General Sani Abacha on March 29.
</P>
<P>
The OAU Council of Ministers has formally passed a 12-point
resolution urging all member states to effectively participate in
the fair, he said.
</P>
<P>
The fair, held once every four years, was approved by OAU
Council of Ministers at its ninth ordinary session in Kinshasa,
Zaire, in 1967. The last one was held in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, in
1992.
</P>
<P>
Due to some problems in preparations, this fair was postponed
from November last year to between March 29 and April 6 this
year.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe on Alert for Letter Bombs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 17 (xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Posts and
Telecommunications Corporation (PTC) has been put on alert for
letter bombs allegedly being sent to U.S. targets throughout the
world including Zimbabwe, the Sunday Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
The letter bombs are believed to be coming from Egyptian
terrorists but an official at the Egyptian embassy in Harare said
joint efforts by Egyptian and American security agents to trace
the origin of the letters in Cairo were not successful.
</P>
<P>
He said this was being done by people bent on tarnishing
Egypt. "But these people are forging Egyptian stamps and postal
marks. It's very easy to forge these things and make them appear
authentic. Evidence shows that nothing was coming out of Cairo,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he confirmed that the letter bombs were being
targeted at Americans and most of the bombs were sent to New York
and one had exploded at a New York newspaper office, injuring two
people who were trying to open or examine the letters.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials within the PTC confirmed to the Sunday Mail
that a warning has been sent out by the Switzerland-based
Universal Postal Union for all postal centers to look out for the
letter bombs.
</P>
<P>
The PTC security department has been on alert and all mail
with Egyptian postal marks or stamps is being treated with
extreme caution and subjected to "extensive security testing",
they said.

HARARE, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The strike by Air Zimbabwe pilots

continuing to be inconvenienced by disrupted flights.
</P>
<P>
Air Zimbabwe spokesman David Mwenga said today the four leased
aircraft from South africa continued to carry passengers to most
of the local and regional destinations while the London flight
remained canceled since the start of the strike last Friday.
</P>
<P>
"So far there has been no progress on the strike and the team
comprising members of the airline's management and striking
pilots and flight engineers has not been set up yet," he said.
</P>
<P>
The estimated 70 pilots and flight engineers are demanding
higher salaries and perks.
</P>
<P>
It is understood that they are demanding an annual salary of
about 350,000 Zimbabwe Dollars (31,818 U.S. Dollars), excluding
allowances for a captain.
</P>
<P>
The airline's management said it cannot, at this stage, afford
the increments due to the low profits the airline had made.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Attacks Netanyahu's Settlement Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today expressed his indignation at the Israeli settlement policy
which "has gravely jeopardized the peace process".
</P>
<P>
In an interview here with the American B.B.S. network, carried
by the Egyptian T.V., the president warned continuation of the
Israeli policy would not lead to just peace but would rather
provoke violence and absolutely grave consequences.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli negotiations have virtually frozen over
the recent Israeli decisions to build 6,500 Jewish homes in East
Jerusalem and withdraw from only 9 percent of the West Bank in the
first stage of further pullback, falling far less than 30 percent
Palestinians had demanded at the moment.
</P>
<P>
"I think that things are plunging," Mubarak said, demanding the
Israelis' commitment to the pledges they made and the agreements
they signed with the Palestinian National Authority.
</P>
<P>
"I had asked all Israeli leaders including Netanyahu and his
predecessors Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin not to ignore the
great significance of Jerusalem," he added.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he sympathizes with Netanyahu who was subject to
strong criticism by hardliners in his coalition government during
the talks on Hebron, Mubarak said peace is much more important
than "the ongoings in the Israeli coalition."
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said that he would resign if he were in the same
predicament faced by Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu,
whose policies have enraged the Arab world and failed to pacify
the hardliners.
</P>
<P>
"If I were in his place and found troubles with the
right wingers and opposition to the agreements signed by previous
Israeli government, I would have resigned," he said. "Peace will
continue with or without Netanyahu," he added.
</P>
<P>
After meeting Jordanian King Hussein Sunday night, Netanyahu
vowed to stick to its plans to begin building the Jewish
neighborhood this week in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
While ruling out the possibility of convening an Arab summit at
this moment, Mubarak said the Al-Quds(Jerusalem) Committee will
hold a meeting chaired by King Hassan II of Morocco in Rabat this
month.
</P>
<P>
On talks between Syria and Israel, the president told the
American network that these talks started and continued during the
Rabin and Peres governments because Syrians felt that the Israelis
respect their agreements with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
But the current negative developments have eaten into the
trust, he said, adding that Syria is ready to restart talks from
the point they stopped in the previous rounds.

<HEADLINE> UK Crimes Total at Twice Official Level: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The real number of crimes
committed in Britain is at nearly twice the level suggested by
official figures, according to a latest survey conducted by MORI
for the magazine, Reader's Digest.
</P>
<P>
The survey, based on interviews with just over 2,000 people all
over the country, estimated that the genuine total number of
offences is around 10 million, compared with the official figures,
which in recent years have put it at just over five million.
</P>
<P>
The survey was released just before the Home Office's
announcement of the figures for 1996 on Monday, which it said
stood at 5,033,800, a fall of 1.3 percent compared with the year
before and the fourth drop in a row.
</P>
<P>
However, the survey said that despite the falling figures,
almost nine out of 10 people surveyed said their concern about
crime had increased in recent years.
</P>
<P>
About 47 percent of those interviewed said they had been
victims of crime in the past year, and 44 percent of those had
failed to report it.
</P>
<P>
They told the survey they had not reported crimes because they
did not think the police would do anything about it, had no
confidence that the criminals would be caught, or because they
felt the offences were too trivial.

</P>
<P>
The figure was up six percent over the record set in 1995, with
turnover increasing by 15 percent to 16.3 billion marks, reports
reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Overseas sales totaled 10.8 billion marks, up 19 percent from
1995, with highest growth being reported in Asia and Australia, at
56 percent, followed by Latin America, 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
Hans-Dietrich Winkhaus, chairman of the Duesseldorf-based
company, attributed increased turnover to the results of
newly-acquired cosmetics company Schwarzkopf in Hamburg.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped that the new U.S. acquisitions, Loctite and
Novamax Technologies, would bring Henkel profits up to a new
record in 1997. Their results will be included in Henkel turnover
this year for the first time.
</P>
<P>
In the first two months this year, Henkel had already
registered both sales and profits growth, according to him.

<HEADLINE> Africans Speak Between 1,250 and 2,100 Languages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Africans today speak between
1,250 and 2,100 languages and dialects, according to a press
release issued here today by the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
</P>
<P>
Linguistic scholars and governmental experts representing more
than 45 African countries are advocating strategies for
multi-lingual educational and cultural policies at a
UNESCO-organized conference convened from March 17 to 21 in
Harare, Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The release said the five-day inter-governmental conference on
linguistic policies in Africa will critically evaluate national
policies and the obstacles multi-lingualism can pose on
education, health, communication and development in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Referring to African languages, the release said: "Cameroun's
eight million citizens share 185, an average of 50,000 speakers
per language," adding that about 410 languages are spoken in
Nigeria, 206 in Zaire and 97 in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
At the other extreme, the release noted, more than 90 percent
of the populations in Botswana (Tswana), Lesotho (Sotho),
Madagascar (Malgache) or Somalia (Somali) share a common
language.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the conference will evaluate language policies
and practices and highlight experiences in multi-lingual
societies, including those outside Africa.
</P>
<P>
"They will also propose regional and sub-regional cooperation
projects and recommend strategies to better integrate
multi-lingualism into political, educational and cultural life,"
the release said.
</P>
<P>
It added that following the meeting of experts, African
ministers will meet in Harare from March 20 to 21 to examine a
final report and adopt a declaration on linguistic policy.

<HEADLINE> Paper: Mercedes Seeks to Triple Business in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Germany's luxury carmaker
Mercedes-Benz AG is seeking to triple its business in Asia over
the next 10 years, the Berlin daily Die Welt reported today.
</P>
<P>
Citing internal company documents, the newspaper said Mercedes
aims to achieve annual sales turnover of 15 billion marks (8.8
billion U.S. dollars) in the Asian region by the year 2006.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the company sold 87,900 cars there, totaling about
5.2 billion marks.
</P>
<P>
Peter Fietzek, a Mercedes manager, told Die Welt that Asia,
particularly China, was considered as a region of growth for the
company. However, Mercedes sold only 1,500 passenger cars and 800
commercial vehicles on the Chinese market in 1996, short of
expected sales volume of 3,000 units.
</P>
<P>
The company is currently shifting its emphasis towards the sale
of commercial vehicles in the region. Its share now of the
regional market for commercial vehicles is less than one percent.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Condemns Israel's Har Homa Building Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat today once again condemned the
Israeli government's decision to go ahead with the construction
of a new Jewish neighborhood in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said that Israel's insistence on building new Jewish
homes in Har Homa (Jabal Abu Ghneim) on the southeastern outskirts
of Jerusalem "violates the signed accords and contradicts the
Middle East peace process."
</P>
<P>
The PNA president was speaking at a press conference following
talks with Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan Ibn Talal and Prime
Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti, who arrived in Gaza this morning.
</P>
<P>
Hassan's visit to the Gaza Strip today was set up in phone
conversation between King Hussein of Jordan and Arafat Sunday
while the king was meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Hassan warned at the press conference against
the danger of renewal of violence in the region, and urged Israel
to understand that there was no alternative to peace.
</P>
<P>
Arafat praised what he called "the Jordanian initiative to
rescue the peace process."
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Hussein paid a condolence visit to the families of
the seven school girls who were shot dead by a Jordanian soldier
in Naharayim in the Jordan Valley Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He also visited a girl pupil and a teacher who were injured
during the shooting incident, at Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem,
as well as President Ezer Weizman, who underwent surgery
Friday after a fall.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Netanyahu, King Hussein arranged a
phone call to Arafat, which, in fact, resumed contacts between
Israel and the Palestinians following disputes over the Har Homa
settlement and other issues.
</P>
<P>
It was also agreed at the phone conversation that Arafat could
fly his plane in and out of the Dahaniya Airport in the Gaza Strip
without special permission from Israel.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that Hassan had carried an important message
today from King Hussein to Arafat on the current situation in the
region, following the visit by Hussein to Israel Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials said that there was an attempt to set up
a three-way meeting between Arafat, Hussein and Netanyahu in the
coming days, which is aimed at resolving differences between
them.

<HEADLINE> Cameroun Launches Campaign Against Female </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Cameroun's Minister of Social
and Women's Affairs Aissatou Yaou launched here today a
campaign against female circumcision.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), sponsor of
the campaign, female circumcision is a major problem affecting
the lives of more than 100 million girls and women in Africa. It
is practised in 27 out of the 46 African countries where WHO
operates.
</P>
<P>
Though not a disease, female circumcision, which partially or
totally removes the clitoris or other sexual organs of a girl, is
considered as a form of violence against women as it causes
excessive bleeding, serious infections, painful or risky delivery
and even death.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in case of group circumcision, the risk of HIV
infection are very high.
</P>
<P>
The minister also called for all women in Cameroun to condemn
female circumcision and to improve women's life.
</P>
<P>
Female circumcision exists mainly in the southwestern and the
extreme northern regions in Cameroun, and constitute a serious
health problem in most African countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- An envoy of the European Union
(EU) threatened here today to withhold its additional financial
investment in the wildlife and tourism sector of Zambia if
nothing is done to "unsuitable tourism developments" in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Head of a delegation of the European Commission Charles Brook
made the warning at the opening of a five-day logical framework
analysis workshop on development of a sustainable wildlife
management system project.
</P>
<P>
He said that at present there is an acute danger of
indiscriminate exploitation of the wildlife estates, exacerbated
by accelerating population growth and proliferation of sometimes
unsuitable tourism developments.
</P>
<P>
If an effective management system is put in place, Zambia will
be in a position to seek additional investment, said Brook.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has been financially and materially
assisting the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Service
of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
At the workshop, Zambian Tourism Minister Amusaa Mwanamwambwa
said the Zambian government is committed to seeing that the
restructuring and re-organization of the wildlife sector succeed.

BEIRUT, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Irish Defense Minister Sean
Barrett inspected today the Irish contingent in the U.N. Interim
Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) at the Irish battalion's headquarters
in Tibnine, Bint Jbeil, in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Barrett, accompanied by General Gerald MacMahon, the Irish
army's chief of staff, and Kenneth Thompson, the Middle East
consultant to the Irish foreign ministry, attended a ceremony of
awarding medals to a number of officers and soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The Irish delegation arrived in south Lebanon Sunday to
celebrate Ireland's National Day with the 80-member Irish troops
taking part in the peacekeeping missions in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
After a parade, the Irish defense minister addressed his
battalion, saying that a rapid change of the situation has been
witnessed in Lebanon since the UNIFIL was established in 1978.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Lebanese people and the Lebanese authorities
have shown a "strong desire" to develop their national army in all
parts of south Lebanon, and the UNIFIL is supported by the
Lebanese authorities in order to fulfill its basical missions.
</P>
<P>
The Irish defense minister noted that the UNIFIl is widely
accepted in the region.
</P>
<P>
Major General Stanislaw Franciszek Wozniak, commander of the
UNIFIL, and Timor Goksel, spokesman of the international force,
attended the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The UNIFIL, comprising contingents from Fiji, Finland, France,
Ghana, Ireland, Italy, Nepal, Norway and Poland, was set up in
March 1978 after Israel's first invasion into Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan recommended another six-month

<HEADLINE> Turkey Hails EU Statement on Ankara's Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today welcomed a statement
by the European Union (EU), which confirmed the perspective of
Turkey's full membership to the group.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that the EU mentioned the possibility of
Turkey's membership in the Union and it would pave the way for
Turkey to take up a position, Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister and
Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller said at a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
She said her country would make new efforts toward full EU
membership. "Our struggle will start from now on," she said.
</P>
<P>
The EU statement was issued Sunday at the end of a meeting of
EU foreign ministers in Apeldoorn, the Netherlands. It said
that Turkey was recognized as having a European future and it
would be treated in the same way as others seeking the EU
membership.
</P>
<P>
The statement came following a March 4 statement by the EU
Christian Democrats which called Turkey's membership application
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Ciller stressed that Turkey had been a NATO member for 46 years
and was the only customs union member among the EU, adding that it
was impossible to exclude Turkey, which applied for full
membership in the Union in 1987, from the expansion process of the
EU.
</P>
<P>
Turkey currently has a customs union agreement with the EU,
which removed some trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel has also expressed his
satisfaction over the EU message, saying that "Turkey's European
horizon has been opened."

<P>
LAGOS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- At least 100 people were killed
after meningitis broke out in northern Ghana since the beginning
of the year, said a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The situation has been worsened due to shortage of vaccine
there, the report said, quoting medical workers in Accra, capital
of Ghana.
</P>
<P>
In the Upper East Region alone, about 80 people have died so
far this year, and the viral disease particularly hit the
regional capital of Bawku, 830 km north of Accra.
</P>
<P>
In Koforidua, a town 85 km north of the regional capital, six
people were killed by cerebro-spinal meningitis (CSM) after an
infected woman traveled from Bawku to attend a funeral.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, Health Minister Eunice Brookman-Amissah went to
Bawku with Defense Minister Alhaji Mahama Iddrisu in an air force
jet, carrying vaccines and mattresses, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the health minister, the World Health
Organization has so far supplied 250,000 CSM vaccines, out of a
required three million.
</P>
<P>
The viral disease has struck earlier than expected, the
minister added.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Army Stresses Coordination With Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese army reiterated
today a coordination with the "brotherly Syrian Arab army" in
confronting any possible Israeli aggression against this country,
and accused the Jewish state of shaking Lebanon's stability.
</P>
<P>
In a directive to its officers and soldiers, the Lebanese army
command noted that Israel is still following "sabotaging plans" by
various means in order to isolate Lebanon and to separate the
Lebanese and the Syrian tracks.
</P>
<P>
The full text of the directive was carried this evening by the
state-run Lebanese National News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The army command underlined that its eye is "always open" and
it "is conscious of the real situation and is coordinating with
the brotherly Syrian Arab army in confronting any possible
Israeli aggression."
</P>
<P>
It accused Israel of "always attempting to shake the stability
and the internal unity in Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
About one year has passed since a suspension of the peace
talks on the Lebanon-Israeli and the Syrian-Israeli tracks, the
command noted.
</P>
<P>
During this period and especially after the Israeli Likud
government taking power, it added, the Jewish state has
witnessedly "gone backward in the peace process and has broken its
promises and agreements of principle it previously reached" with
Arab states.
</P>
<P>
As far as Lebanon concerned, the directive pointed out, Israel
"has not hidden its intentions toward Lebanon and its sabotaging
plans against Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
"Israel is still making efforts by various means in a purpose
to isolate Lebanon and to separate the Syrian and Lebanese tracks
from each other," the command said, putting the so-called Lebanon
First" proposal raised by Israel as an example.
</P>
<P>
Beirut has argued that the "Lebanon First," put forward by the
Likud government after taking power in June 1996, was aimed at
"driving a wedge" between Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon upholds an interlock of the Lebanese and Syrian
tracks, and refuses to sign a separate peace agreement with
Israel before Syria does so.

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Palestinian Negotiators Meet In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
officials met here this evening in an attempt to get the
troublous negotiations back on track, according to a report of
the state-run Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh and Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Minister of Local Government Saeb Erekat
discussed, among other things, an arrangement of a summit
between Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Today's talks came following an intervention by King Hussein
of Jordan in the stalled Israeli-Palestinian talks during a
visit here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Netanyahu, Hussein arranged a phone
call with Arafat, which resulted in the resumption of contacts
between the negotiators of the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Early in the afternoon, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai and Palestinian Minister of Planning and International
Cooperation Nabil Sha'ath met in Tel Aviv. They agreed that
Arafat could fly his plane in and out of the Dahaniya Airport in
Gaza without special permission from Israel. Until now his plane
would take off from Egyptian territory.
</P>
<P>
However, overall agreement on general operation of the airport
is still to be reached. Israel demands security control for the
facility.
</P>
<P>
Sha'ath told reporters after the meeting that the arrangement
for President Arafat's flights is a small, but an important
one. He hoped that the airport will be opened up very soon,
adding that conclusion of an agreement on its utilization for
all passengers and cargo is very important for the Palestinian
people and their economy.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai made it clear that there was no connection between
today's achievement and other outstanding issues.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy said in an interview with
Israel Radio today that Netanyahu and Arafat would probably meet
this week. He said that the construction of New Jewish homes in
Har Homa in East Jerusalem should not affect the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The groundwork of the Har Homa settlement is expected to
begin in a couple of days. But the Palestinians would not budge
in its opposition to the construction.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Welcomes EU Decision on Accession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government considered
"positive" a European Union (EU) Council decision concerning
accession talks, Government Spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the decision reaffirming the start of accession
talks with Cyprus, made by the EU Ministerial Council in Apeldorn
of the Netherlands on Sunday, Cassoulides told his daily press
briefing that Cyprus' course to the EU is "irreversible."
</P>
<P>
EU Council decided two years ago that EU accession talks with
Cyprus will begin six months after the end of the
Intergovernmental Conference.
</P>
<P>
But some EU members has preferred to a Cyprus solution before
accession talks. Last month, Germany, Britain and France made a
proposal that the Turkish Cypriots should participate in the
EU-Cyprus accession talks, which was rejected by the Cypriot
government.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman pointed out that the relevant EU decision of
March 6, 1995 does not consider a Cyprus solution as a
precondition for the island's EU membership.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that "accession negotiations would be less
complicated and easier if a solution were reached beforehand."
</P>
<P>
He said that Cyprus could facilitate the improvement of
Greco-Turkish relations as well as EU-Turkish relations.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Foreign Minister Alecos Michaelides said last
Sunday's EU Council decision "will facilitate to a significant
extent our course to Europe."
</P>
<P>
The Apeldorn meeting also urged Turkey to show flexibility
in the Cyprus question to overcome the obstacles for closer
ties between Turkey and the EU, as called for in the customs
union agreement the EU has concluded with Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, divided since the 1974 Turkish invasion, applied for
full EU membership in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Le Pen Asks Court to Hold Controversial Book </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Jean-Marie Le Pen, the president of
France's extreme-right National Front (FN) party, has asked the
15th Tribunal of Grand Instance of Paris to impose prior restraint
on the book "Roman d'un President", announced today its
publisher Librairie Plon.
</P>
<P>
In this biography of President Jacques Chirac written by
journalists Maurice Szafran and Nicolas Domenach, Le Pen was
quoted as saying that Chirac was taken hostage by Jews, such as
the B'nai Brith, by promising not to ally with the FN in exchange
for "an enormous sum of money and exceptional international
support."
</P>
<P>
Le Pen described the passage carrying the quotes as defamatory,
and asked the court to suppress all the disputed passages in its
sample editions being sold, besides demanding a 100,000 francs
(20,000 U.S. dollars) compensation from the book's publisher and
authors.
</P>
<P>
The B'nai Brith has threatened to sue Le Pen for defamation and
anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
The 15th Tribunal of Grand Instance of Paris will study the
issue on March 24.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Warns of Liquidating Palestinian Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said today that the Arab world would never accept a peace
dictated by Israel, an action that might liquidate the Palestinian
problem rather than solve it.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference at the Presidential headquarters, Moussa
said that most Arab countries are committed to the last Arab
summit statement that peace had to be established on the
principles of the Oslo and Madrid agreements.
</P>
<P>
"Any deviation from this line would mean succumbing to Israel
and would also lead to Arab division," he said, adding that "We
will never accept anything that challenges it."
</P>
<P>
On Sunday Israel vowed to break ground for a new settlement in
Arab East Jerusalem this week.
</P>
<P>
"No matter how great the pressures are exerted on the
Palestinians, to accept a peace dictated by Israel, through
mediation or any other way, will not be acceptable," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the Gaza international conference held at the
weekend on the Har Homa settlement in Jerusalem would bear
pressure on Israel, Moussa said that international pressure was
actually there but "Israel just did not care about these
pressures."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Moussa denied reports that Palestinian National
Authority President Yasser Arafat, on a visit here early this
month, was so pessimistic about peace talks with the Israelis that
he thought of moving from Gaza to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
He also slammed a threat made by Israel's Justice Minister
Tzahi Hanegbi against Arafat that he faced possible expulsion from
the self-ruled Gaza Strip should a wave of unrest erupts. "It is
extremely insolent," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Secretariat staged today a comprehensive structural and
organizational reform, with Secretary-General Kofi Annan
announcing the integration into one of three departments for
economic and social affairs.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, the secretary-general said the new
secretariat arrangements should serve to bolster support for
Africa's development, South-South cooperation and the sustainable
development of small island developing states.
</P>
<P>
The three departments to be merged are the Department for
Policy Coordination and Sustainable Development, the Department
for Economic and Social Information and Policy Analysis and the
Department for Development Support and Management Services.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the latest efforts by the secretary-general to
reform the United Nations in areas that fall within his
authorities. Previous measures included the creation of a policy
coordination group, an executive coordinator for U.N. reform and
reform groups by all relevant entities.
</P>
<P>
In staging the comprehensive structural and organizational
reform, the secretary-general also proposed a 123 million U.S.
dollar cut for the regular budget for the biennium 1998-1999
compared with the previous biennium. In this connection, he
proposed a reduction of approximately 1,000 posts in the program
budget for the biennium 1998-1999.

LUANDA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-nine UNITA 's members of

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan is determined to call a direct meeting between leaders of
two Cypriot communities before the end of June, according to a
European Union (EU) official.
</P>
<P>
EU presidency representative for Cyprus, Kester Heaslip, said
he himself believed such a meeting between President Glafcos
Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash to solve the
protracted Cyprus problem is possible.
</P>
<P>
Heaslip is currently in Cyprus to attend the 11th meeting of
the EU-Cyprus Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Annan "is very determined" to see the two leaders meeting
before the end of June, he said.
</P>
<P>
Last week the U.N. Chief's Resident Representative in Cyprus
Gustave Feissel began indirect talks through bi-weekly separate
meetings with Clerides and Denktash to break current deadlock and
pave the way for face-to-face talks.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied 37 percent of the island in the wake of a short-lived
Greek Cypriot coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-sponsored peace talks aimed at reuniting the island
under a bizonal and bicommunal federal state, have been held on
and off for the past 23 years, but so far no tangible results have
been achieved.
</P>
<P>
Clerides and Denktash have not met sine October 1994 when the
two men held two round of informal talks in Nicosia under the
U.N. auspicies, which reached a deadlock.

<HEADLINE> Four Killed, 30 Wounded in Car Bomb Attacks in Algiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Four people were killed and about
30 wounded this afternoon in the Algerian capital in three car
bomb attacks which were apparently staged by Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
The state radio quoted a communique of Algerian security forces
as saying that soldiers were immediately dispatched to the scenes
of the attacks to rescue the victims.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in two months for Algiers to be again
subjected to terrorist attacks, after the militant Armed Islamic
Group (sIA) carried out a spate of attacks in the capital from
December 23, 1996 to January 21, killing 48 people and wounding
more than 200.
</P>
<P>
The bombings coincided with an extensive operation being
launched by the Algerian army against the members of the GIA in
the central Algerois region and in Algiers, which was in
preparation for the country's legislative elections scheduled for
June 5.
</P>
<P>
The explosions, which took place separately within one hour,
hit the popular district of Kouba from 15:00 local time (1400
GMT), according to witnesses.
</P>
<P>
A bus stop highly frequented by local people in Ben Omar, near
Kouba, was targeted, while two other bombs blew up beside a house
in the town of Coopemad of the Anassers district and by a road in
the same district.
</P>
<P>
The GIA announced on February 22 in a fax sent to the Arabic
language newspaper Al-Hayat that it would start a "new phase" of
war to "cut the throat of all the apostates and their allies in
the cities and in the villages."

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine military and the
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) were urged today to reach an
overall ceasefire agreement following the resumption of
hostilities in Buldon, Maguindanao province in the southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Government chief peace negotiator Fortunato Abat said that
instead of blaming each other of who first violated local
ceasefire, the two sides should start to talk about the general
cessation of hostilities.
</P>
<P>
Abat suggested a sub-committee meeting be held immediately
before the scheduled third round of low-level talks between the
two sides in April to include the general cessation matter in the
proposed agenda of both panels.
</P>
<P>
At least three government soldiers were killed in mortar
attacks launched by MILF rebels last Saturday and Sunday against a
military detachment located in Buldon.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Al Haj Murad, MILF vice-chairman for
military affairs, said that a teacher and 10 high school students
were killed inside the MILF's camp by government troops.
</P>
<P>
Murad added that the MILF is waiting for appropriate actions
from the government to address properly the latest rash of
atrocities in Buldon.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is a breakaway faction of the mainstream Moro National
Liberation Front, which signed a peace agreement with the
government last year.
</P>
<P>
The government and the MILF had held two rounds of preliminary
talks since the beginning of the year. They have agreed to form a
third independent party to oversee the temporary ceasefire between
the two sides.

<HEADLINE> ESCAP Marks Fiftieth Anniversary in Shanghai (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Nation's Economic and
Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) marked its
fiftieth anniversary by holding an international symposium here
today.
</P>
<P>
The three-day symposium, under the theme of "development
challenges and opportunities for Asia and the Pacific in the 21st
century and the role of the ESCAP," will discuss such issues as
development of human resources, environment and sustainable
development, trade and investment. It is attended by over 100
delegates from members and alternative members of the ESCAP,
including Japan, Thailand, Malaysia, Chile, Singapore and India.
</P>
<P>
During the symposium, the delegates will visit the historical
site of the ESCAP office and the Pudong New Area in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Half a century ago, the UN set up in Shanghai the Economic
Commission for Asia and the Far East (ECAFE), the predecessor of
the ESCAP.
</P>
<P>
In his keynote speech at the opening of the symposium, Chinese
Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said that in the
past five decades, after winning political independence, more and
more developing countries in Asia and the Pacific have embarked on
an independent development road and begun their economic takeoff.
</P>
<P>
By the early 1990s, the per capita GNP of some major developing
countries in this region had exceeded 2,000 US dollars, he
said. In 1995, the export of the goods manufactured in Asia took
40 percent of the world's total, exceeding that of Western Europe
and North America combined.
</P>
<P>
In the past ten years or more, he said, the economies of Asian
countries have enjoyed an annual average economic growth rate of
8.1 percent, four times that of the developed countries in the
same period. Asia, and East Asia in particular, has become one of
the areas with the most dynamic and fastest growing economy in the
world.
</P>
<P>
He said that the convocation of the Asia-Europe Meeting last
year reflected a historic change in Asia-Europe relationship and
the move of the world toward multipolarity. It further enhanced
economic links among the two continents and ended the past unequal
relationship between Asian and European states.

<P>
Qian said that the ESCAP brings together 3.2 billion people
with different development levels, political and social systems
and cultural traditions. As the oldest inter-governmental
organization for multilateral economic and political cooperation
with the broadest representation, the ESCAP has played a unique
role in promoting development in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
He said that today, with necessary reform in light of the
actual needs, the ESCAP will gain fresh vitality and improved
efficiency, and will make even greater contribution to the
economic and social development in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has for years supported the ESCAP in its
work and received useful help from the ESCAP in carrying forward
its economic development and the reform and opening up
program. The two sides have maintained a good relationship of
cooperation. In future, China will unswervingly adhere to the
policy of reform and opening-up, make new efforts and enhance
cooperation in all fields with the ESCAP and its members.
</P>
<P>
Adrianus Mooy, executive secretary of the ESCAP, said at the
opening of the symposium that as the unique intergovernmental
forum covering the vast Asia-Pacific region, the ESCAP has forged
a sense of regional identity through its efforts.
</P>
<P>
"As we look ahead, I have every confidence that ESCAP's role in
promoting regional cooperation in the economic and social fields
will be further strengthened and reinforced," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li Zhaoxing, China's vice-minister of foreign affairs, made a
theme speech under the title of "work together for a peaceful,
stable and prosperous Asia-Pacific region in the 21st century" at

<P>
He pointed out that as the human being is about to ring in the
21st century, the Asia-Pacific region faces rare historic
opportunities:
</P>
<P>
-- The post-Cold War world in which peace, development and
cooperation have become the major theme provides favorable
external conditions for enhanced economic cooperation between this
region and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
-- Asia and the Pacific have entered a period of prolonged
peace and development, which serves as the political foundation
for long-term growth of all countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
-- Rapid economic growth in this region in the past 20 years or
more has brought about the material basis for developing countries
to move to a new high in their economic and social development in
the next century.
</P>
<P>
-- Growing multi-channeled and multi-tiered intra- and
inter-regional cooperation in Asia and the Pacific opens a broad
prospect for mutually beneficial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Qian stressed that at the same time, the Asia-Pacific region is
facing severe challenges. There are still destabilizing factors in
the region and the economic growth in the region is uneven. Most
countries in the region, where 72 percent of the world's poor
population live, are developing countries. They have a weak
science and technology foundation, and lag behind developed
countries in Europe and America, particularly in such hi-tech
fields as the information technology. As the economy grows, the
restraining factors such as pressure on the environment,
inadequate infrastructure and population explosion have become
more and more salient.
</P>
<P>
He said that how to rise up to these challenges and bring an
Asia-Pacific region of long-term stability and prosperity into the
21st century is a major historic task facing every country in the
region. Experience that can be drawn from the regional countries'
endeavor in the past five decades can be summed up as follows:
</P>
<P>
-- First and foremost, peace must be maintained. Without peace
and stability, economic development means nothing but empty
rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
-- Countries should adopt a road of development suitable to
their respective national conditions, and this is the basis for
successful economic development in the region.
</P>
<P>
-- Diversity in the region should be respected and translated
into a driving force for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
-- Vigorous efforts should be made to promote scientific and
technological cooperation and achieve development through science
and technology. ESCAP members differ greatly in terms of science
and technology level, and they are also highly complementary to
one another. Therefore, they should enhance scientific and
technological cooperation and technology transfer so as to
facilitate common prosperity.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Parliament speaker and
presidential hopeful Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri today pledged no
interference in the internal affairs of other countries.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here, the 54-year-old speaker, the most
serious candidate for the 7th presidential elections scheduled for
May 23, declared that he will follow the domestic and foreign
policy of President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Constitution bars the present president from running for
a third consecutive term, so the 64-year-old president has to
step down from the office in August.
</P>
<P>
While outlining his foreign policy in the future, Nateq-Nouri
said that Iran maintains good relations with most of the
countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
He denied any problem with the Central Asian states, Pakistan
and Persian Gulf countries regards to the issue of the Islamic
revolution.
</P>
<P>
Observers here say that Nateq-Nouri is now trying to modify his
image from a hardliner to a moderate in the Iranian society and
the world.
</P>
<P>
As to Nateq-Nouri's foreign policy, Mohammad Javad Larijani,
vice-chairman of the Iranian Parliament Foreign Policy Commission,
said at the press conference that Nateq-Nouri has made two trips
to the Persian Gulf, adding that "this means he (Nateq-Nouri)
attaches an enormous importance to the region."
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran and other countries of the Persian Gulf
should have a collective cooperation for security and development.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is the priority of Iran's foreign policy to
expand its ties with Asian countries.

<HEADLINE> WFP Official Leaves DPRK After Inspection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The executive director of the
World Food program (WFP), Catherine Bertini, left here today after
a four-day inspection in which the WFP agreed to donate 100,000
tons of emergency food aid to the flood-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
Bertini inspected the flood-ravaged Unpha, Rinsan and Phyongsan
counties in northern Hwanghae Province of the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
The executive director was accompanied by vice-chairwoman of
the State Agricultural Commission Kim Yong Suk, and involved
officials.
</P>
<P>
She toured Unpha Bridge and residential districts nearby
devastated by floods, and was informed of the damage scale.
</P>
<P>
The WFP official also met and talked with farmers at sites for
the rehabilitation of devastated farm lands, which is progressing
with the WFP's assistance. She visited a nursery, a kindergarten
and houses.
</P>
<P>
She said the inspection made her a witness of the catastrophic
consequences of two years of natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
Bertini stressed that for the devastated arable lands to be
restored to the original state, and for provisions to be made to
decrease possible flood damage in future, a lot of work such as
afforestation and embankmenting should be done.
</P>
<P>
She added that the efforts to restore farming and production to
normal required additional food supplies from the world community.
</P>
<P>
In her speech at a banquet given to mark the end of her visit
here Monday, she said the visit allowed her to confirm at first
hand that the materials donated for WFP activities in the DPRK had
been successfully used.
</P>
<P>
It was important, above anything, else to render emergency
food supplies amounting to 100,000 tons as called for by the WFP,
she said.
</P>
<P>
She called once again upon the donor nations and the
international community to give much more humanitarian assistance
for improving the food situation.

<P>
Charles Stevens, Microsoft's vice president in charge of Far
East operations, said, "We have always taken a close interest in
the accelerated development of the information technology industry
through collaboration with China's PC manufacturers."
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Legend paid a total of 50 million yuan in licensing
fees to Microsoft and other companies so that legitimate software
could be installed in its computers.
</P>
<P>
Legend, which was established in 1984 by 11 CAS computer
experts with an investment of 200,000 yuan, topped the list of
computer companies in sales last year. It had ten percent of the
Chinese PC market in 1996, leading all other major Chinese and
foreign computer manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Simplified Chinese Windows 95-based Legend systems will also
come with Microsoft's Certificate of Authenticity but with no
price increase for new products, Legend's officials said.
</P>
<P>
"By offering computers with Windows 95 at no extra cost," the
company's vice president said, "we not only ensure the true and
genuine application of legitimate software, but also reduce the
consumer's initial investment and protect the value."
</P>
<P>
Legend last year joined in promoting Pentium-based PC's in
China with Intel Corporation, another major American computer
manufacturer.

<P>
BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The computer software giant
Microsoft bit a profitable chunk out of the Chinese computer cake
by selling 400,000 copies of Simplified Chinese Windows 95, which
are to be used in Legend personal computers from now on.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft reached an agreement with the Legend Group, China's
largest computer manufacturer. That is the largest deal since
China and the United States reached an agreement on intellectual
property rights last March.
</P>
<P>
The deal gives Legend the right to install Microsoft's
Simplified Chinese Windows 95 in its PC's. Legend officials
declined to give the exact details of the contract, saying only
that it will be tied to sales of Legend PC's in 1997 and is
expected to be worth over 100 million yuan (12 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
"Most important," Li Qin, vice president of Legend, said, "We
can play a part in raising the nation's technology level to
internationally competitive standards."
</P>
<P>
The vice president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Bai
Chunli, said that the contract demonstrates the determination of
the Chinese government and enterprises to enforce the intellectual
property rights agreement.
</P>
<P>
The contract also confirms the Legend Group's place as the
first local computer manufacturer to install Simplified Chinese
Windows 95 and to pass Microsoft's "Designed for Windows 95"
test.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Philippines Ends Textile Row with U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- After eight months of hard
bargaining, the Philippines and the United States have finally
reached a compromise to end a dispute over a new U.S. rule which
restricts imports of textile products.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed in Washington earlier this month by
Antonio Basilio, deputy chief of the Philippine negotiating
mission, and Rita Hayes, chief U.S. textile negotiator, the
Philippine Garment and Textile Export Board said Monday.
</P>
<P>
But the deal has been kept under wraps by Washington in an
apparent bid to prevent other trading partners from demanding
similar concessions, according to officials at the board.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the United States will take a series of
compensation measures to offset losses the Philippines would incur
by implementing the rules of origin.
</P>
<P>
The deal, which is retroactively effective to January 1 this
year, requires the United States to lift its quotas on competitive
Philippine exports of infant apparel.
</P>
<P>
The deal also allows the Philippines to increase its garment
exports to the U.S. by 60 million U.S. dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
An 11 percent increase will be given to exports of Philippine
garment products classified in Group 2 which includes non-apparel
items such as table cloth.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the U.S. will increase by 15 percent annual
quota for certain Philippine products in Group 1, which includes
T-shirts, blouses, jeans, jackets and sweaters.
</P>
<P>
In exchange, the Philippine government agreed to withdraw its
unfair trade practice suit filed in July 1996 with the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
In a sign of the government's satisfaction with the agreement,
Escolastica Segovia, executive director of the Garment and Textile
Export Board, said the U.S. concession was "an unlimited
opportunity for local garment exporters to tap."
</P>
<P>
The trade dispute between Manila and Washington erupted last
July when the U.S. unilaterally implemented its new mark of origin
rule for its garment imports in violation of the WTO's own rules.
</P>
<P>
Under the WTO's rules, the U.S. is not supposed to formulate
the mark of origin rule. The WTO is the only international body
entitled to formulate and standardize such rules acceptable to all
members, including the Philippines and the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The WTO's Agreement on Textile and Clothing requires WTO
members to observe common mark of origin rules for garment
products.
</P>
<P>
Under the WTO agreement, the apparel exports to the U.S. are
credited against the quota of the exporting country. But the U.S.
new rule provided that finished garment exports are credited
against the quota of the country that produced the fabric.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. rule requires textile-exporting countries like the
Philippines to obtain export visas from third countries, if
imported fabrics from third countries would be used in making
final garment products bound for the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
A failure to produce such export visas will serve as ground for
U.S. Customs officials to impound affected shipments.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines, which relies heavily on imported fabrics to
produce garment products, considers the requirement an unfair
trade practice, because third countries are reluctant to issue
such visas which may deduct their own quota garment exports to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Philippines filed a complaint before the WTO
soon after the United States implemented the new rule on July 1
last year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has long been the biggest market for the Philippine
textile products, which are one of the major foreign reserves
earners for the country.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the Philippines exported 1.67 billion dollars worth of
textile products to the U.S., accounting for 60.8 percent of its
total textile exports that year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Philippine government, the U.S. rule would
deal a heavy blow to its textile industry which employs directly
and indirectly five million workers.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. rule will adversely affect some 50 medium-size
companies exporting home furnishing and made-up textile products,
which account for at least 30 million dollars in export receipts.
</P>
<P>
Unlike Segovia's optimistic reaction to the just-concluded
agreement, trade experts here believed the agreement can only
temporarily end the garment row between the two countries since
most of the concessions granted by the U.S. will last only until
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines will have to re-negotiate with the U.S. to
extend these concessions before the year ends.
</P>
<P>
The experts said the only way to avoid a new trade dispute
between Manila and Washington is to fully implement the WTO's
Agreement on Textile and Clothing.
</P>
<P>
Under this 10-year agreement, developed countries, like the
U.S. and Japan, are committed to phasing out quotas imposed to
developing nations on textile and articles of clothing until the
year 2004.

<HEADLINE> Track-Laying Completed on Major Southwest China Railway Line (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng and
Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua attended a ceremony today in Baise City in
the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region to mark the completion of
track-laying on the Nanning-Kunming Railway line.
</P>
<P>
One of the country's key construction projects, the line was
completed more than three months ahead of schedule. It will be
put into use at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Workers joined the tracks at 9:39 a.m. at Badu station on the
Nanpan River, on the border of Guangxi and Guizhou Province,
after receiving the go-ahead from Zou, an event that Li described
as "a glorious achievement in China's railway-building history."
</P>
<P>
The 898.7-kilometer Nanning-Kunming (Nankun) Railway starts in
Nanning, capital of Guangxi, and ends at Kunming, capital of
Yunnan. One section of the line runs north to Hongguo, in Guizhou
Province.
</P>
<P>
The Nankun is a single-track electrified line with a designed
speed of 80-120 km per hour, a short-term carrying capacity of ten
million tons and a long-term one of 30 million tons annually.
</P>
<P>
So far, nearly 20 billion yuan has been spent on the project,
with the central government being the largest backer. Also
involved were Guangxi and Guizhou, which contributed 200 million
yuan each, Yunnan, which spent 600 million yuan, as well as a
Japanese loan equivalent to 4.6 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The line had the largest unit cost of any railway in China,
because geological conditions made construction work difficult,
according to Zhou Zhenyuan, director of the Construction
Department of the Ministry of Railways.
</P>
<P>
"The line is the hardest that has ever been built in the
country" said Zeng Derong, an engineer at the construction
headquarters.

WASHINGTON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Russia's Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov said in
Washington that while Russia wanted "normal relations" with NATO
regardless of its form, it would never approve of NATO's
enlargement.
</P>
<P>
-- Secretary General Kofi Annan outlined concrete plans for
streamlining the United Nations. The proposals entail reducing
budget and staff levels in parts of the United Nations and moving
200 million U.S. dollars from bureaucratic spending to development
aid.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Anthony Lake suddenly withdrew as President Clinton's
nominee to be CIA director on Monday, saying that continued
Republican opposition led him to conclude over the weekend that
there was no end in sight for his confirmation process.
</P>
<P>
-- British Prime Minister John Major announced on Monday that
general elections will be held on May 1, kicking off a formal
campaign that is widely viewed here as the most Americanized in
the country's history -- longer, more expensive and more
personality-oriented than ever.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States is suddenly eager to clear up exactly
where in the Gulf of Mexico the boundary lies between U.S. and
Mexican territory, an issue the United States is taking on new
urgency now that offshore-drilling technologies allow oil
companies to explore deeper and deeper seas.
</P>
<P>
-- The Japanese are coming to India, a fast-growing market
where U.S. multinationals have been the dominant foreign
companies.

<P>
MOSCOW, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin,
recently recovered from double pneumonia, decided to take a
two-day rest before leaving for Helsinki for the summit with his
United States counterpart, Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The president's press secretary, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, said
today that before going to his suburban residence, Gorki-9,
Yeltsin will be briefed for the Russia-U.S. summit by Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
Primakov returned today from a three-day visit to Washington.
</P>
<P>
During his U.S. visit, aimed at paving the way for the Thursday

Defense Secretary William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister maintained Russia's opposition against the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) enlargement, and
demanded a legally-binding document from NATO which would provide
security guarantees.
</P>

But NATO only offered a NATO-Russia charter in which Russia
would be given a major role in Europe's security order in the next
century.
</P>
<P>
NATO expansion will be a critical issue at the Helsinki summit,
the 11th between presidents of the two powers.
</P>
<P>
Despite Russia's opposition, the U.S. insists on allowing
applicants to enter NATO as from 1999, and NATO leaders plan to
issue formal invitations to some ex-Warsaw Pact states at the July
summit in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
Both sides hoped to make compromises at the summit but admitted
it would be "tough". President Yeltsin said it "will be the
hardest one in the history of Russian-American relations."
</P>
<P>
Apart from the NATO issue, the reduction of strategic offensive
weapons and economic relations between the two countries will also
be on the summit agenda.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, hospitalized for double pneumonia on January 8,
returned to Kremlin just over two weeks ago after a five-months
absence following heart bypass surgery last November.

<HEADLINE> OAU Chief Arrives in Nairobi for Summit on Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-general of the
Organization of African Unity Salim Ahamed Salim said here today
that "the time is ripe" for the warring parties of Zaire to
"effectively end hostilities and begin negotiations".
</P>
<P>
He stated that he does not think that Zaire will break apart,
saying that "we are totally committed to the unity, stability,
security and territorial integrity of Zaire."
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief made the remarks to reporters after arriving
here today to attend a regional summit meeting on the Zaire
crisis to be opened on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The summit, to be hosted by Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi,
is a continuation of the peace efforts made before by regional
leaders to find a peaceful solution to the conflict, said Salim.
</P>
<P>
He noted that this particular summit assumes great importance
and comes just a week before an OAU special summit on Zaire
crisis to be held in Lome, Togo.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the Nairobi summit will be briefed on the
Zaire conflict by African foreign ministers who have made a peace
mission to Zaire and special envoy of the United Nations and the
OAU Mohamed Sahnoun who has been touring to Goma, headquarters of
the Zairean rebels, Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi, he added.
</P>
<P>
The regional leaders are trying to make conditions for peace,
and "it is up to the warring parties to make peace", he stressed.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Prime Minister of Zaire Kango wa Dongo
will join Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, President Paul Biya
of Cameroun, South African Deputy President Thabo Mbaki and
Congolese President Pascal Lissouba at the summit tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time for Zaire to attend such a regional
summit meeting on its internal crisis.
</P>
<P>
The third largest African country has refused to be present at
the Nairobi Summit I and II because of the attendance of Uganda
and Rwanda accused of supporting the Zaire rebels.
</P>
<P>
This time, President Moi did not invite the Zairean rebels,
Uganda and Rwanda to the meeting. The rebels led by Laurent
Kabila, advancing on several fronts in Zaire, has refused to end
hostilities before negotiations proposed by the UN and also
dismissed the Nairobi summit as pointless.

<HEADLINE> Manila Maintains 1st-level Alert on Mayon Volcano </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Institute of
Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) maintained the first-level
alert on Mayon Volcano after a three-day thorough study and
observation of its activities.
</P>
<P>
Phivolcs volcanologist Eduardo Laguerta said today that the
study found a possible magnetic disturbance and a slight increase
in the overall level of Mayon's activities.
</P>
<P>
These activities include a persistent crater glow, an increase
in the number of earthquakes recorded daily, and an increased
sulfur dioxide output, Laguerta added.
</P>
<P>
Volcanologists had recorded a significant crater glow since
January 21 and a relatively high level of earthquakes that picked
22 events on February 28.
</P>
<P>
They also found that sulfur dioxide emission has increased from
the background level of less than 200 tons per day to around 1,000
tons per day, prompting them to warn residents against entering
the 6-kilometer radius danger zone around Mayon Volcano in Labay
province, the central Philippines.
</P>
<P>
At least 78 people were killed when the volcano erupted on
February 2, 1993.

<HEADLINE> Syria Wants US to Be Honest Peace Broker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Labor Minister Ali Khalil
today stressed the importance of the role played by the United
States in the Mideast peace process, urging it to act as an honest
broker.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian minister made the remarks in an interview with the
Cairo-based Voice of Arab radio, following the U.S. move to veto a
U.N. Security Council draft resolution to bar a new Jewish
settlement in East Jerusalem, which has damaged its credibility as
a fair mediator in the peace march.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian minister praised Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
for stressing the Arab position during recent talks with
U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian president said earlier that he took new ideas to
Washington for consultations with Clinton on ways to resume
Syrian-Israeli peace talks. He is expected to brief Arab leaders
on the results of his U.S. trip in a couple of days, according to
the radio.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. has not informed Syria so far of any new
proposals on bringing the Syrian-Israeli talks back on track,
said the Syrian minister.
</P>
<P>
No improvement appeared in the Syrian-Israeli talks, which had
been suspended since last February and deadlocked over the fate
of the Golan Heights. Syria asks for a full return of the
strategic plateau for peace with the Jewish state, a request
accepted by the former Israeli Labor government but turned down
by incumbent Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
"Syria will only resume negotiations with Israel from the
point they broke off and on the basis of the land for peace
principle," he affirmed.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian labor minister held Israel responsible for the
current stalemate in the peace process, adding that its
insistence on constructing a Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem
means it is pushing the region headway to instability and anarchy.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace process, which could have run on
track after the Hebron deal, was stuck again over the recent
Israeli decision to build 6,500 homes for Jews and close four
Palestinian offices in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Palestinians were also angered by an Israeli
promised withdraw from only 9 percent of the rural West Bank as
the first step of further pullbacks, while the Palestinians
demanded a 30 percent pullout.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: China Invests Heavily in Ethnic Minority Areas (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- During the Ninth Five-Year Plan
(1996-2000) period, China will invest some 800 billion yuan in the
ethnic minority-inhabited areas, according to the State
Nationalities Affairs Commission.
</P>
<P>
The investment will focus on infrastructure and resource
development. A new wave of construction will surge through the
ethnic areas, say analysts.
</P>
<P>
China invested a total of 364 billion yuan in infrastructure
construction and key projects during the Eighth Five-Year Plan
(1991-1995) period.
</P>
<P>
China's ethnic minority-inhabited areas consist of Guangxi
Zhuang, Tibet, Xinjiang Uygur, Inner Mongolia and Ningxia Hui
autonomous regions, 30 autonomous prefectures and 121 autonomous
counties with a combined population of 103 million people.
</P>
<P>
The ultimate goal of the Communist Party of China is to help
all ethnic groups progress together and shrug off backward status,
a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has made efforts to develop the economy
in the ethnic areas since the founding of the People's Republic of
China in 1949. The development of the economy in the areas and
common prosperity for all ethnic groups are mandated by law.
</P>
<P>
The government has implemented a wide range of preferential
policies, and placed more than 100 billion yuan worth of subsidies
in the ethnic areas in the past several decades.

<TEXT>
<P>
In northwest China, the plural line of Lanzhou-Xinjiang railway
has been completed and the construction of a six billion-yuan
railway running through southern Xinjiang has started. In
southwest China, the track-laying on the 20 billion-yuan
Nanning-Kunming railway completed today. The railway arteries are
expected to greatly improve the macro-economic environment of the
ethnic minority areas.
</P>
<P>
In southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region,
high-grade highways between Nanning, Wuzhou and Beihai are in
operation. A dozen ports with a handling capacity of 10,000 tons
have been completed in port cities. Five airports are being
renovated or under construction.
</P>
<P>
In the coming five years, some 40 percent of resource
development and infrastructure construction projects and about 60
percent of the foreign-funded projects will be in the ethnic areas.
</P>
<P>
The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which accounts for about
one-sixth of the nation's territory, has been listed as a new
growth area of the national economy. In 1996, the central and
local governments spent 12.2 billion yuan embarking on 33 major
projects, covering cotton, petrochemicals, and gas prospecting and
development. The region is expected to become China's largest
cotton base and important non-ferrous metals, petroleum and
natural gas industrial bases in the early next century.
</P>
<P>
In the 1991-1995 period, the central government had put 11
billion yuan in the electric power industry in Inner Mongolia,
which is rich in coal resources. More investment will be made in
Inner Mongolia in the 1996-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
The support from developed east areas in terms of talents,
funds and technology has opened up a bright future for the ethnic
areas. The State Council stipulated last year that Beijing,
Guangdong, Shandong and Tianjin pair up with Inner Mongolia,
Guangxi, Xinjiang and Ningxia to advance the economy of the
latter. And special plans are jointly carried out by various
ministries as well as provinces and municipalities to advance the
economy of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The overall growth rate of the five autonomous regions has
surpassed the national average, statistics indicate. The growth
rate of the gross domestic product in the regions exceeded ten
percent last year, surpassing the national average level for the
sixth consecutive year. The growth rate of per capita net income
of the farmers in the autonomous regions has also surpassed the
national average level.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Scientist Develops Nose-Drop Flu Vaccine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 18 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli researcher has
developed the world's first influenza vaccine in the form of
nose drops, according to the Jerusalem Post today.
</P>
<P>
The successful clinical trials were announced Monday by Prof.
Zichria Zakay-Rones, a senior virologist at the Hebrew
University-Hadassah School of Medicine, who headed a team that
has worked on the new vaccine delivery system for six years.
</P>
<P>
The flu vaccine has been found safe and effective. One would
merely need to get a few drops in the nose each year for
protection.
</P>
<P>
Zakay-Rones said she didn't know when the nose-drop vaccine
would become commercially available, as process of getting
approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other
government bodies is expensive and laborious.
</P>
<P>
However, she added, negotiations are currently being conducted
by the university's research and development arm, Yissum, and an
application for a U.S. patent has been presented.
</P>
<P>
The vaccine previously was found effective against flu in
mice; it now has been tested on 51 medical students, 24 of
them given one dose and the others two doses.
</P>
<P>
The trials showed that none suffered side effects, and a single
dose was enough to provide immunity. Some of the students have
expressed interest in participating in further trials next
winter, which will involve more people, some of them over the
high-risk age of 65.
</P>
<P>
It was a complex procedure, using three current strains of
killed flu virus that can be absorbed through the mucous
membranes (instead of going directly into the blood stream).
</P>
<P>
In conventional flu vaccine, virus antibodies are created and
remain primarily in the blood; this only provides partial
protection because the virus first enters the body via the
respiratory system, where it begins to multiply.
</P>
<P>
Zakay-Rones said the preparation can be easily and quickly
produced, even when a new strain of flu virus emerges around
the world. It protected medical students suffering from colds
and sinusitis.
</P>
<P>
She will present results of the clinical trials at a
conference in Washington next month, and findings will be
published in a scientific journal after the patent application
is approved.

<HEADLINE> China: Human Rights Implementation Should Reflect National </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- A representative of China's human
rights delegation said here today that the implementation of
international human rights provisions should give full
consideration to different national conditions.
</P>
<P>
Xu Hong was speaking about the implementation of international
human rights instruments at the ongoing session of the United
Nations Commission on Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
The forum opened its annual six weeks meeting on March 10.
</P>
<P>
He said the treaty bodies, when considering the reports
submitted by states parties, "should take into full consideration
the different economic development levels and historic, social and
cultural backgrounds of different countries."
</P>
<P>
The principles of impartiality, objectivity and non-selectivity
should be observed in carrying our the mandates, Xu said. Only by
doing so could the effective implementation of human rights
instruments be further promoted.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government has always attached great importance to
international human rights instruments. Up to now, China has
already acceded to 17 human rights conventions, and has taken an
active part in the drafting and elaboration of new international
human rights instruments," Xu said.
</P>
<P>
In the implementation of human rights conventions, the Chinese
government had also exerted every effort in taking various
effective measures," Xu told the 53rd session.
</P>
<P>
"In the field of law enforcement, China's administrative and
judicial organs conduct their work strictly according to law and
fight against human rights violations resolutely. The Chinese
government has, at the same time, by various means given publicity
to human rights instruments so as to enhance the awareness of the
whole society to respect and protect human rights," Xu said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government pays great attention to its cooperation
with the treaty bodies, which could be well proved by its value to
the work of the report submission," the Chinese official said.
</P>
<P>
Xu said the Chinese government was ready to join other
countries in strengthening its cooperation with the human rights
organs of the United Nations, and in continuing its efforts for
the promotion of the normal functioning of the United Nations in
the field of human rights.
</P>
<P>
He said that the international human rights treaty bodies
should establish a relationship of mutual respect, mutual
cooperation and conduct dialogue on an equal footing with them.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was a very important part in the international
human rights activities to fully stress international human rights
instruments and to bring them into full play.
</P>
<P>
Xu said: "This should find its expression not only in
strengthening the treaty monitoring mechanisms, but also, and more
importantly, in the practical implementation of the provisions of
the existing conventions.
</P>
<P>
"And its realization should be promoted mainly through efforts
of the states parties to the conventions themselves," Xu said. He
stressed: "States parties are entitled to formulate implementation
measures in accordance with their own concrete national
conditions."

CANBERRA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar plunged
more than half a US cent as US investors sold the currency because

The local unit ended at 79.06 US cents from 79.75 at Monday's
close.
</P>
<P>
Colonial State Bank head of foreign exchange John Basile said,
the selling of the currency was because of weaker gold and
commodities prices, the currency has the potential to drop lower
if the gold price weakens further.
</P>
<P>
On the cross-rates, the Australian dollar closed at 97.61 yen
from Monday's 98.61 yen against the Japanese yen and it was 1.3387
marks from 1.3521 marks against the Deutsche mark.

<HEADLINE> Track-Laying Completed on Major Southwest China Railway Line (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Work on the railway started in December of 1990 and lasted more
than five years. The line climbs from Nanning, which is only 78
meters above sea level, to the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, which is as
high as over 2,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
Because of the swift rivers and precipitous mountains along the
line, workers had to build 477 bridges and 258 tunnels with a
combined length of 274 km, a figure that is more than three times
that of the Beijing-Kowloon railway, even though the Nankun is
only a third as long.
</P>
<P>
Two of the engineering feats are the 183-meter-tall Qingshuihe
bridge in Guizhou, the country's tallest railway bridge, and an
underground tunnel built near Xiaoyugu station on the Guizhou rail
section because of the landslides that occur frequently on both
sides of the line, Zhou told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"Though expensive and difficult, the line had to be built,"
Zhou said, explaining that it was a Chinese government effort that
gave priority to developing resources and building basic
facilities in central and western areas to boost the economic
growth there.
</P>
<P>
The railway is regarded as China's largest poverty-relief
project of the 1990s. There are 15 million people living in
poverty along the rail line, accounting for a quarter of the
country's total. There are also many ethnic groups living in the
area.
</P>
<P>
The Nankun connects up with the Changsha-Nanning and
Nanning-Fangcheng railway lines in the east and the
Chengdu-Kunming and Guiyang-Kunming railways in the west. When the
ports at Guangxi's Fangcheng, Qinzhou, and Beihai are considered,
the railway will become an important outlet to the sea for
southwest China's inland areas, Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
New regional economies in the southern and western part of
China will be formed by the railway, and opportunities will be
created for provinces to cooperate economically with Southeast
Asian countries, authorities point out.
</P>
<P>
Because southwest China is the country's largest source of
aluminum and phosphate, and is rich in other mineral resources,
the Nankun is expected to be a key "Development Road".
Construction work has begun on the Tianshengqiao hydropower
station in Guizhou's Qianxinan Prefecture, which has an installed
generating capacity of 2.52 million kilowatts, and on the Pingguo
Aluminum Plant in Guizhou.

<HEADLINE> Track-Laying Completed on Major Southwest China Railway Line (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng and Vice-Premier
Zou Jiahua attended a ceremony in Baise City in the Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region to mark the completion of track-laying on
the Nanning-Kunming Railway line.
</P>
<P>
One of the country's key construction projects, the line was
completed more than three months ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
Workers joined the tracks at 9:39 a.m. at Badu station on the
Nanpan River, on the border of Guangxi and Guizhou Province,
after receiving the go-ahead from Zou, an event that Li described
as "a glorious achievement in China's railway-building history."
</P>
<P>
The 898.7-kilometer Nanning-Kunming (Nankun) Railway starts in
Nanning, capital of Guangxi, and ends at Kunming, capital of
Yunnan. One section of the line runs north to Hongguo, in Guizhou
Province.
</P>
<P>
The Nankun is a single-track electrified line with a designed
speed of 80-120 km per hour, a short-term carrying capacity of ten
million tons and a long-term one of 30 million tons annually.
</P>
<P>
So far, nearly 20 billion yuan has been spent on the project,
with the central government being the largest backer. Also
involved were Guangxi and Guizhou, which contributed 200 million
yuan each, Yunnan, which spent 600 million yuan, as well as a
Japanese loan equivalent to 4.6 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The line had the largest unit cost of any railway in China,
because geological conditions made construction work difficult,
according to Zhou Zhenyuan, director of the Construction
Department of the Ministry of Railways.
</P>
<P>
"The line is the hardest that has ever been built in the
country" said Zeng Derong, an engineer at the construction
headquarters.

TIRANA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Albanian President Sali Berisha

food to the country in chaos, and to help restore order.
</P>
<P>
"Europe's immediate assistance is extremely crucial for Albania
to overcome current difficulties," Berisha said in a meeting with
the mission Monday night.
</P>
<P>
The delegation led by Dutch roving ambassador Jan Comte de
Marchant et d'Ansembourg, and comprising representatives from the
European Union (EU), the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe (OSCE), and Italy and Greece, flew into Albania earlier
Monday to assess how to best deliver aid to the country largely

<HEADLINE> Iran Reiterates Support to Palestine, Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Parliament Speaker Ali
Akbar Nateq-Nouri reiterated today Iran's support to the people
of Palestine and Lebanon in their struggle to "liberate" their
occupied lands.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with foreign reporters today, Nateq-Nouri said
Iran supports the people in Palestine and south Lebanon "within
the framework of the international laws and regulation."
</P>
<P>
"It is the responsibility of all nations to help the people in
Palestine and South Lebanon," he added.
</P>
<P>
But he did not specify what kind of support Iran is offering
to anti-Israeli organizations such as pro-Syrian Hezbollah, or
Party of God, and the Islamic Jihad.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that Iran will continue its opposition to the
Middle East peace process, which is in danger particularly after
the outbreak of Jewish settlement crisis.
</P>
<P>
Israeli government approved a plan on building a Jewish
settlement in Arab East Jerusalem late February, which sparked
widespread protest from the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Nateq-Nouri said Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani
stated earlier that Iran will continue to offer "all kinds of
support" to the Palestinian Intifada, or uprising.
</P>
<P>
"We rejected the Middle East peace process as defective from
the outset. It is a joint U.S.-Zionist move in a bid to serve
their own interests," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said "our interpretation of the essence of the peace
process came true just recently when the Israeli government
began to breach all previous agreements."
</P>
<P>
"We made it clear from the very beginning that it (the Middle
East peace process) is a game intended to deceive the people of
Arab world," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian parliament speaker said that Israel negotiated
with Syria but it refused to give back an inch of their land,
which refers to the Golan Heights the Jewish state seized during
the 1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
Despite its opposition to the Middle East peace process, Iran
has openly declared that it is not going to do anything to disrupt
the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Speaker: Iran to Invite Mubarak for OIC Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Iranian parliament speaker Ali
Akbar Nateq-Nouri declared here today that Iran is to invite
Egyptian President Muhammed Hosni Mubarak to a summit meeting of
the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) due in Tehran in
December.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made here today by Nateq-Nouri, who is
also the front-runner of the 7th presidential elections scheduled
for May 23.
</P>
<P>
While answering a question posed by Xinhua in a joint
interview in the parliament, Nateq-Nouri said that All Islamic
heads of state will be invited and those include Egypt and its
President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
"We expect all of them to attend the OIC summit meeting in
Tehran and this is our natural expectation," he added in the 70-
minute-interview given to Xinhua, the German News Agency (DPA),
the Japanese News Service (Kyodo) and the Korean Central News
Agency (KCNA).
</P>
<P>
A building for holding the summit is near completion at the
Sadabad Palace in the northwestern suburb of Tehran and about 42
heads of state of the Islamic world is supposed to attended.
</P>
<P>
As to the question when Iran will extend the invitation to
Mubarak, the 54-year-old speaker said "the schedule on the
delivery of the invitation is with the Foreign Ministry and it
is their job to decide."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Foreign Ministry will also decide whether
the foreign minister himself or other people to do the job.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that Iran is launching an active drive
to seek support from the heads of state from other Islamic
countries for the OIC summit in its capital in a bid to form a
united front among them against foreign powers such as the United
States and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati is currently on
his 10-nation tour carrying messages of President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani to his counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Velayati has been to some of the 42-member-OIC states, namely
Turkey, Malaysia, Indonesia, Uganda, Sudan, Oman and Saudi
Arabia. He is currently in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
King Fahd of Saudi Arabia expressed earlier his thanks to
the invitation extended by Rafsanjani. But he was reported not to
have promised to come to Tehran for the OIC summit.
</P>
<P>
But, Nateq-Nouri said "We regard King Fahd's response as a
positive one. We anticipate he would take part in the conference
if his health allows."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian speaker said that the gathering of heads of the
Islamic states does not mean "we have planned to conspire
against the United States."
</P>
<P>
"... We plan to get together and talk (with) each other to
make uniform of our policies in an attempt to serve our interests
best," he added.

<HEADLINE> Row over Liberia's New Elections Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lagos, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Dispute over new appointment in
Liberia's elections commission between the interim government
leader and her colleagues has caused concern over the peace
process in the country.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, four of the six members of Liberia's ruling Council
of State published a statement denouncing a decision taken by
council chairman Ruth Perry on new appointment in the elections
commission of the country.
</P>
<P>
In her announcement at the weekend, Mrs. Perry made known the
names of new members chosen for the elections commission and the
appointment of a new commission chairman.
</P>
<P>
According to her statement, the appointee of the National
Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL), Gloria Scott, who headed the
commission until now, had been replaced by veteran journalist
Henry Andrews.
</P>
<P>
But no sooner had the statement come than her colleagues,
mainly females on the council, denounced it as a dangerous
manipulation and unilateral decision.
</P>
<P>
No details of the issue are immediately available at the
moment, but analysts noted it would have some negative impact on
the forthcoming general elections slated for May 30 this year, if
not properly resolved.
</P>
<P>
Liberia's existing Council of State was reshuffled last August
when a peace agreement was signed by parties concerned to end the
Liberian crisis in Abuja, capital of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Ruth Perry was on the occasion made chairman of the council,
which also comprised major warlords Charles Taylor of NPFL,
Alhaji Kromah of the United Liberation Movement (ULIMO-K) and
George Boley of the Liberia Peace Council.
</P>
<P>
The three former factional leaders resigned their posts of
vice-chairmen of the interim government at the end of last month,
targeting at the presidency in the general elections.
</P>
<P>
The elections commission which had been under the influence of
the former warring factions was to be re-organized following the
requirement of a meeting of foreign ministers of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) held in mid-February.
</P>
<P>
According to the ECOWAS foreign ministers, the "independent
elections commission" would comprise seven members, with three of
them each appointed by the three former faction leaders and the
other four each rising from the alliance of seven political
parties, women's organizations, youth organizations and labor and
trade unions.
</P>
<P>
The elections commission would also include technical advisors
from ECOWAS, the United Nations and Organization of African
Unity. But they will not enjoy the power to vote.
</P>
<P>
With the successful disarmament and disbandment of Liberia
factional fighters that ended in January, the peace process has
kept its track.
</P>
<P>
The West African peacekeeping force, known as ECOMOG which
monitored the disarmament exercise, has started redeployment to
ensure that its troops be at all polling stations across the
country during the elections.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG is also working on a proposal to train about 500
Liberian police personnel who will be available for election
duties during the election period.
</P>
<P>
Despite the good environment to be created by ECOMOG to ensure
free and fair elections, analysts said the row between Mrs. Perry
and her colleagues over the elections commission members should
be appropriately settled.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, the peace process will be affected, they added.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia's Funcinpec Party Emphasizes Support for Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Cambodian Funcinpec Party
today emphasized that it strongly and solemnly supports and
encourages a free and fair elections scheduled for 1998, when the
present National Assembly ends its five-year mandate.
</P>
<P>
The Funcinpec Party, led by the Cambodian First Prime Minister,
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, said, "nobody and no party can interrupt
or hinder the scheduled free elections."
</P>
<P>
The statement was a rejection to the idea of Hun Sen, Vice
Chairman of the Cambodian People's Party (CPP), who warned last
week that there would be no elections if King Norodom Sihanouk
abdicated.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen also proposed a constitutional amendment that would
force royal family members to forgo their royal status if they
sought office.
</P>
<P>
The Funcinpec statement argued that the constitution has no
clause that prohibits the King from abdicating, and bans any
Cambodian citizen of the royal family from engaging in politics.
</P>
<P>
The Funcinpec statement demanded that the CPP clarify whether
Hun Sen's statement was his own belief as a Khmer citizen, or the
common position of the CPP.
</P>
<P>
At its Extraordinary Congress held in January, the CPP made
clear that it supports the commune and national elections due to
be held, respectively, later this year and next year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Khmer Nation Party president, Sam Rainsy, also
issued a press release today in opposition to Hun Sen's statement.
</P>
<P>
"Every citizen is entitled to the same civil and political
rights regardless of his or her descent," Sam Rainsy declared.

<HEADLINE> Steel Giant Krupp Plans to Take Over Rival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Five years after a merger with the
Hoesch steel company, German steel giant Krupp is now planning a
takeover of the rival Thyssen steel firm, German television
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Krupp's takeover plan is aimed at resolving its own financial
problems with Thyssen's capital reserve, Thyssen officials were
quoted by television as saying.
</P>
<P>
They also feared that the best parts of their company would be
destroyed and thousands of jobs axed because of the takeover.
</P>
<P>
In protest against the plan, Thyssen workers walked off their
jobs Tuesday morning and planned a demonstration at Krupp
headquarters in Essen later today.
</P>
<P>
Workers at Krupp also expressed their concern about the
development and announced they too would demonstrate against the
takeover bid.
</P>
<P>
With an annual turnover of nearly 39 billion German marks
(about 22 billion U.S. dollars) in 1996, Krupp-Hoesch is the
largest German steel producer, followed by Thyssen with a turnover
of about 24 billion marks. Both companies saw their profits
halved in 1996 because of heavy losses in steel production.

BONN, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Six German soldiers were arrested
Monday for beating up non-Germans in an organized racist attack in
downtown Detmold, a town halfway between Cologne and Hamburg, said

<HEADLINE> Manila Calls for Cease-fire With Muslim Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government chief peace
negotiator Fortunato Abat today called for a general cease-fire
agreement between the military and the Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF).
</P>
<P>
Abat made the call over a local radio following the resumption
of hostilities between the military and the MILF in Buldon in the
southern province of Maguindanao.
</P>
<P>
"Instead of blaming each other as to who first violated local
cease-fires in certain areas in Maguindanao, why don't we talk on
the general cessation of hostilities first," Abat said.
</P>
<P>
Abat also suggested that a subcommittee meeting be held
immediately before the scheduled third round of low-level talks in
April to include the general cessation matter in the proposed
agendas of both panels.
</P>
<P>
At least three government soldiers were killed in mortar
attacks launched by MILF rebels over the weekend against a
military detachment in Buldon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Al Haj Murad, MILF vice-chairman for military
affairs, said a teacher and 10 students of a school inside Camp
Abubakar, the MILF's biggest camp, were killed and one was wounded
when the military shelled the school building.
</P>
<P>
Murad said they are waiting for appropriate actions from the
government to address properly the latest clashes in Buldon.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government and the MILF signed a local
cease-fire agreement last month after a week of fighting in Buldon
claimed more than 50 lives.

<P>
The center, which is expected to operate officially next year,
will also receive financial support from users. The initial
research topics of the center will include computer crime and
retail trade technology.
</P>
<P>
There will be five to ten experts working at the center,
including some from Australia, Japan and Canada, but some will not
stay in Thailand as they work with other experts through computer
network, the agency said.

<HEADLINE> Italian PM Arrives in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano
Prodi arrived here from Damascus, the capital of Syria, this
morning in an effort to upgrade Italy's role in the region.
</P>
<P>
Prodi was received at the airport by his Lebanese counterpart
Rafik Hariri and the two left the airport immediately after the
Italian prime minister arrival for official talks in the
Governmental Palace.
</P>
<P>
This is the first visit by an Italian prime minister to
Lebanon although Italy is Lebanon's biggest European trade
partner.
</P>
<P>
Prodi is also due to have meetings with Lebanese President
Elias Hrawi and House Speaker Nabih Berri and then will hold a
press conference before flying back to Rome from his 10-hour stop
in Beirut, the second and last leg of his trip to the region,
where the Italian prime minister will bypass Israel, which is
normally included in standard diplomatic tours in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of his arrival here, Prodi believed that his talks
with his Lebanese counterpart will be "decisive in laying down
permanently energetic relations" between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Beirut's An-Nahar daily, Prodi said he
admires the "combative spirit" that the Lebanese people never
give up, and describes Beirut as "the amazing city" which is
"closer to Rome than Berlin."
</P>
<P>
He said his government planned to upgrade its political role
in Lebanon and in the Middle East to a level matching its
position as the number one economic and trade partner.
</P>
<P>
"Italy's political and economic weight enables it to take up
an important role in the peace process and observe the
principles of democracy and the basis of economic development,"
Prodi said.
</P>
<P>
"The Middle East is the flashpoint of the Mediterranean
region," he added. "We want to serve the cause of peace and the
progress in the Palestinian area and Lebanon. We enjoy great
credibility in the region because we are not biased."

Chi, also Vice-Chairman of the Central Military Commission and
State Councillor, made the remarks at a meeting with New Zealand
Defense Secretary Jerald Hensley in the Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
Chi extended a welcome to Hensley and described him as an "old

chapter to the Sino-NZ military exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Hensley is the first senior NZ military officer visiting China

</P>
<P>
The promotion of China's relations with NZ and other South
Pacific countries benefits not only China and NZ but also promotes
peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The NZ guest arrived here Sunday at the invitation of Chinese
Defense Ministry. Gui Fulin, deputy chief of the general staff of
the Chinese People's Liberation Army, held talks Monday with

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Helsinki Summit Will Be Tough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The coming U.S.-Russian summit
will certainly be a tough one, due to the big difference between
the two countries over the proposed eastward expansion of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
</P>
<P>
The row over NATO's plan to expand into Central and Eastern
Europe is set to dominate the summit scheduled for Thursday and
Friday in Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton's second-term administration has
listed the alliance's enlargement as a top foreign policy goal,
while Russia has taken blocking the plan as its number one foreign
policy target.
</P>
<P>
Russia has long opposed the expansion, arguing that the move
will create a new divide in Europe following the end of the Cold
War and will militarily threaten its national security.
</P>
<P>
Russia insists on concluding a legally-binding document with
NATO which will provide security guarantees. But NATO only offers
a NATO-Russian charter in which Russia will be given a major role
in Europe's security order in the next century.
</P>
<P>
"A document on the parameters of Russia-NATO relations should
be binding," Russian President Boris Yeltsin told a Finnish
newspaper last week. "We intend to put it to ratification, because
we cannot, on past experience, be satisfied with non-binding
assurances."
</P>
<P>
The United States insists, on the other hand, that Russia has
no veto power on the expansion though Russia has a say in this
matter.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has vowed to allow the applicants to enter NATO as from
1999 and NATO leaders plan to issue formal invitations to some
ex-Warsaw Pact states, most possibly Poland, the Czech Republic
and Hungary, at the NATO summit scheduled for July in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats say that Washington will not accept Moscow's demand
that NATO be changed into a political organization.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Helsinki Summit Will Be Tough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Both Clinton and Yeltsin have admitted that the coming talks
would be tough. Earlier this month, Clinton told his second
post-inauguration news conference that the summit will be "a tough
debate" since the Russians have reasons "in their own psyche and
circumstances that make it a difficult one."
</P>
<P>
Noting that the differences could be unbridgeable, Yeltsin said
last week that the summit "will be the hardest in all the history
of Russian-American relations."
</P>
<P>
Despite these difficulties, the two sides may make some
progress in the discussion of the charter which will define the
future Russian-NATO relationship.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has promised that there will be no deployment of
nuclear weapons, nor a military build-up on the territories of new
NATO members, and these commitments might be written into the
future charter.
</P>
<P>
Some Western analysts believe that Russia, for its part, may
have to acquiesce in the expansion behind scenes while continuing
to attack it publicly.
</P>
<P>
On arms control, which is another topic high on the agenda, the
two leaders may pledge to implement START II, the second nuclear
weapons reduction treaty between Moscow and Washington.
</P>
<P>
But it will be difficult for them to start negotiations on a
START III treaty. This is because Russia's Duma, or parliament, is
still unwilling to ratify START II, arguing that the treaty was
signed in 1990 by taking advantage of the weakness of the then
Soviet Union.

in Europe's security order in the next century.
</P>
<P>
"A document on the parameters of Russia-NATO relations should
be binding," Russian President Boris Yeltsin told a Finnish
newspaper last week. "We intend to put it to ratification, because
we cannot, on past experience, be satisfied with non-binding
assurances."
</P>
<P>
The United States insists, on the other hand, that Russia has
no veto power on the expansion though Russia has a say in this
matter.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has vowed to allow the applicants to enter NATO as from
1999 and NATO leaders plan to issue formal invitations to some
ex-Warsaw Pact states, most possibly Poland, the Czech Republic
and Hungary, at the NATO summit scheduled for July in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats say that Washington will not accept Moscow's demand
that NATO be changed into a political organization.
</P>
<P>
Both Clinton and Yeltsin have admitted that the coming talks
would be tough. Earlier this month, Clinton told his second
post-inauguration news conference that the summit will be "a tough
debate" since the Russians have reasons "in their own psyche and
circumstances that make it a difficult one."
</P>
<P>
Noting that the differences could be unbridgeable, Yeltsin said
last week that the summit "will be the hardest in all the history
of Russian-American relations."
</P>
<P>
Despite these difficulties, the two sides may make some
progress in the discussion of the charter which will define the
future Russian-NATO relationship.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has promised that there will be no deployment of
nuclear weapons, nor a military build-up on the territories of new
NATO members, and these commitments might be written into the
future charter.
</P>
<P>
Some Western analysts believe that Russia, for its part, may
have to acquiesce in the expansion behind scenes while continuing
to attack it publicly.
</P>
<P>
On arms control, which is another topic high on the agenda, the
two leaders may pledge to implement START II, the second nuclear
weapons reduction treaty between Moscow and Washington.
</P>
<P>
But it will be difficult for them to start negotiations on a
START III treaty. This is because Russia's Duma, or parliament, is
still unwilling to ratify START II, arguing that the treaty was
signed in 1990 by taking advantage of the weakness of the then
Soviet Union.

<HEADLINE> Deadly Beef Bacteria Found Again in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 18 (Xinhua) -- A second beef sample from
Yaohan's Sha Tin store has tested positive for the deadly H7
strain of E-coli O-157 bacteria, according to local media reports
today.
</P>
<P>
The sample was one of 13 taken on March 8 after the local
department of health first detected the killer virus in beef at
the store a week earlier. Other samples taken from different
supermarkets all tested negative.
</P>
<P>
Health officials said that this suggested contamination was
occurring at the store, not the abattoir as first thought.
</P>
<P>
"The most likely thing is that the second E-coli sample was due
to contamination of equipment," a health official said.
</P>
<P>
The health department was quoted as saying that it could not
rule out that some pork might have been contaminated as the same
mincer was used for beef and pork, even though the department
could not find the bacteria on minced pork samples collected
later.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone's Ousted Rebel Leader Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Two key members of Sierra
Leone's rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) today in separate
interviews described the toppled RUF leader Foday Sankoh as
"unreliable and intransigent".
</P>
<P>
Michael Sandin, one of the four RUF representatives to the
eight-member Commission on Peace, said the change in the RUF
leadship was "premediated as it goes in the right direction
which would usher complete and positive changes."
</P>
<P>
Sandin denied that there was a power struggle within the RUF's
high command.
</P>
<P>
"Sankoh was the only stumbling block and as such there was a
need for him to be changed," he told an independent FM radio
station -- Sky 106.
</P>
<P>
"This was a decision taken at the highest level of the RUF as
it appears Sankoh did not want nor desire peace even though the
rest of the combatants demonstrated their willingness to give
peace a chance," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Appearing in the talk show at the same radio station, another
RUF member Agnes Deen Jalloh said that "after six years Sankoh
has proved unreliable."
</P>
<P>
Deen Jalloh, a former teacher at a training college in the
east of the country, claimed Sankoh wanted to become president of
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the RUF with new leadship would take up arms if
they are disillusioned in the near future, she said that "we have
vowed not to fight any more."
</P>
<P>
However, the RUF was "disappointed" with the attitude of
government troops, she said, referring to an incident in 1992 in
Bunumbu where returnee civilians were classified as rebel
collaboration and forced to dig their own graves and shot.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Portuguese JLG Convenes 28th Plenary Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison
Group (JLG) discussed five issues concerning the transition of
Macao in its 48th plenary session which started here today.
</P>
<P>
The five issues were the localization of civil service, of law,
the implementation of Chinese as an official language, the
nationality issues of some Macao residents and the "Oriental
Foundation."
</P>
<P>
Guo Jiading, chief representative of the Chinese side of the
Sino-Portuguese JLG, said after today's meeting that some progress
has been scored in the three leading issues of the transition,
namely the localization of civil service, of law and the
implementation of Chinese as an official language.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the two sides have been in good cooperation in
the localization of law, and evident achievements have been made,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"The consultation on the Criminal Law and the Code on Criminal
Procedure were finished," he said. "Based on that, this year we
will step up the process on the consultation of some other leading
laws, including the Civil Law, Code on the Civil Procedure and the
Commercial Law."
</P>
<P>
But he said that was not enough.
</P>
<P>
"There is less than three years time left before the handover
of power," he pointed out. "It is urgent for the Portuguese side
to quicken the process of the handling of the three leading issues
since the current progress lags behind the requirements of a
stable transition and smooth handover of power."
</P>
<P>
In particular, he said the localization of civil servants,
especially of those middle and senior-ranking officials, should
should enjoy high priority. A proper number of Chinese citizens
should assume those duties.
</P>
<P>
"The localization process should be handled step by step and
in accordance with a general plan," he stressed. "It cannot be
solved abruptly in the time just before December 19, 1999."
</P>
<P>
On the question of nationality, the ambassador said that that
question is only referred to those descendents of Portuguese who
were born in Macao. He pledged that they would be free to choose a
citizenship of either China or Portugal.
</P>
<P>
"Their wishes will be fully respected," he said. "They need
not worry and should live on in Macao, and continue to make their
contributions to the prosperity, stability and development of
Macao."
</P>
<P>
Antonio Santana Carlos, Guo's Portuguese counterpart, told
reporters that the Portuguese side has presented a detailed
material to the Chinese side, and that the Portuguese side is
conscientious in the localization process.
</P>
<P>
"The Portuguese side hopes that all localization process will
be finished before it leaves Macao in 1999," he said. "The
government (of the future Macao Special Administrative Region)
will continue to function well."
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said that the Portuguese side hopes to "achieve
good results" in the three leading issues with further exchange of
views and materials under an atmosphere of friendly cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Marks Birthday by Donating Blood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today marked his 69th birthday by donating 250 cc of blood to the
Philippine National Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
The new donation brought to three gallons the blood Ramos has
"shed" for a good cause since he started his annual donation of
blood as a young military officer way back in 1957.
</P>
<P>
Before blood was extracted from Ramos, the Red Cross asked
permission from Dr. Raul Fores, the president's personal physician
who headed the surgical team that operated on Ramos to remove a
blockage in his right carotid artery last December 23.
</P>
<P>
Rosal, head of the Red Cross blood donation program, said they
had to be "doubly sure" that the president could donate blood
without any adverse effect on his health, considering his recent
operation.
</P>
<P>
Ramos was in high spirits as the fluid was released from his
body, even jokingly telling Rosal and other Red Cross staffers to
check if what they were getting "was not red wine."

<HEADLINE> UNCP, DPN Lead in Nigerian Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lagos, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Nigeria Congress Party
(UNCP) and the Democratic Party of Nigeria continue to lead in
Saturday's local government elections on a party basis.
</P>
<P>
The latest reports said that the UNCP has won the chairmanship of
230 local government areas, out of a total of 464 in 29 of the 36
states, where the results have come out.
</P>
<P>
The DPN is the runner-up with 128 chairmanship seats, while the
other three parties, the National Centre Party of Nigeria, the
Grassroots Democratic Movement and the Congress of National Consesus
lagged far behind with 37, 34 and 35 seats, respectively.
</P>
<P>
A breakdown of the results show that the UNCP leads in 12 states,
including Lagos, Abuja, Kaduna, Delta and other politically critical
states.
</P>
<P>
The DPN is the majority party in seven states, including Oyo, Imo,
Osun, Adamawa, Kano, Zamfara and Sokoto.
</P>
<P>
Stalemate is reported in 147 local government areas, where a
run-off election will be held at a date to be decided by the National
Electoral Commission of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
As more reports on the elections are hitting the press, there
have been stories of isolated violences and protests over the
results of the elections.
</P>
<P>
In Delta State, a 18-year-old girl was killed while many were
injured in a protest which led to a conflict between the protesters
and the police. In Rivers State, a man was stabbed while voting.
</P>
<P>
But, generally, all the parties, including international observers,
have so far agreed that the election is free, fair and peaceful.
</P>
<P>
The final success of Saturday's election will mark a major
achievement of the military government's transition to civl rule
program, and will inject confidence into other events of the
program scheduled later this year, including the elections of
state assemblies and governors.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak, Netanyahu Exchange Views Over Phone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
and Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu had discussions on
the obstacles of the Middle East peace process over telephone
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian MENA news agency reported today that Mubarak
received the phone call from Netanyahu and they discussed the
difficulties and obstacles confronting the Palestinian-Israeli
peace track.
</P>
<P>
During the discussion, Mubarak asserted the necessity to
implement the Israeli troop redeployment agreement in Hebron and
to find a solution to the situation in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
According to another report, the Israeli leader informed the
Egyptian president that he had tried to have a meeting with the
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat Monday on ways and means to save
the peace process, but Arafat turned down the offer.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mubarak also received a phone call from the
Jordanian King Hussein. The two leaders exchanged views on the
latest developments on the Palestinian track and current contacts
under way on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have been mounting between the Palestinians and the
Israelis since the Israeli government decided in late February to
build a Jewish neighborhood in the Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, Israelis are to start building the
neighborhood today at Har Homa in East Jerusalem. The Israeli
military authorities Monday night declared the Palestinian areas
from Bethlehem to Beit Sahur a "closed military zone" which lies
close to Har Homa area. And the Palestinians have set up protest
tents on the slope of a nearby hill overlooking the construction
site.
</P>
<P>
On the confrontation, Mubarak Monday said to the Egyptian
Nile TV International that all Arabs, Muslims and Christians
were concerned of what was happening there.
</P>
<P>
"Jerusalem is a very delicate question not only for the
Israelis but also for all Muslims and Christians all over the
world," the president said.
</P>
<P>
"The issue should be dealt with the utmost care due to its
sensitivity and because it might bring out problems which could
lead to complicating the situation," he added.
</P>
<P>
He warned against the Israeli settlement policy and said the
consequences would be very grave. He urged Israel not to be
overconfident by insisting on the policy of building settlements
and said it should realize the reality of the situation and
properly re-evaluate the issue.
</P>
<P>
"Continuation in this policy will not contribute to achieving
a just peace but rather it will lead to violence and very grave
consequences," Mubarak stressed.

<HEADLINE> GNP Expected to Grow 8 Percent in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' gross national
product (GNP) is expected to hit 8 percent in the first half of
1997, the maximum level the government expects to attain by the
end of the year, according to the latest Business Expectations and
Perceptions Survey (BEPS).
</P>
<P>
The BEPS is a quarterly poll covering company performance of
the Philippines from July to December of the previous year and
businessmen's economic expectations for January to July of the
current year.
</P>
<P>
Businessmen in the country expect GNP to grow 8 percent by as
early as the first six months of the year, it said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the country's GNP grew 6.8 percent, slightly below
expectations but well above the 5 percent recorded in 1995. The
1996 GNP performance was comfortably within the official target of
6.5 to 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Aside from the positive prospects for GNP growth, the survey
said most businessmen interviewed seemed to be fully convinced
that prices of basic commodities and goods will remain stable in
the first two quarters of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The boost in confidence among businessmen in the country could
be traced to the economy's relatively stable situation during the
last six months of 1996 when almost all locally-based firms
experienced hefty growths in income partly due to increased demand
from the domestic market, it said.
</P>
<P>
The survey said 45 percent of respondents agreed that their
gross sales in the second half of 1996 rose significantly from the
previous semester and 37.5 percent of those interviewed reported
slight increases.
</P>
<P>
It said local businessmen were no longer as worried as they
used to be during the economy's fledgling years between the late
1980s and the early 1990s when the economy was still caught in a
boom-and-bust cycle.

<HEADLINE> Saudi King: Israeli Settlement Plan Violates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 18 (Xinhua) -- King Fahd of Saudi Arabia
has accused Israel of violating the Middle East peace process by
proceeding with the plan to establish a new Jewish settlement in
East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He told a cabinet meeting in the Saudi capital of Riyadh
Monday night that the Israeli decision runs counter to relevant
U.N. Security Council resolutions and that of the Madrid peace
conference, the Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) reported from Riyadh
today.
</P>
<P>
Fahd said that "the new settlement measures violated the
international community's concession towards maintaining the
demographic and geographic status of Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
Following its cabinet decision last week, Israel was reportedly
determined to start construction of the new Jewish settlement in
East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want as the capital of
their future independent state.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the plan, some 6,500 new housing units are
to be constructed for Jews in Har Homa, also known as Jabal Abu

The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states earlier this month

<HEADLINE> Abacha: Lapses in Council Polls to Be Corrected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Head of State General
Sani Abacha said on Monday that all lapses observed in last
Saturday's local council polls would be corrected to
avoid recurrence in subsequent elections in the country.
</P>
<P>
The government has received reports of some observed lapses,
especially organizational and logistics ones, according to
press reports today.
</P>
<P>
Such lapses will be minimized in the course of Nigeria's
transition to civil rule program, Abacha said when meeting with a
group of Americans observing Nigeria's elections in Abuja, the
capital.
</P>
<P>
The 38-member American election monitoring group has
complained of some problems in certain areas they visited during
the elections, but the group members have unanimously lauded the
polls as free and fair, giving the transition process a pass
mark.
</P>
<P>
Joan Wallace, the head of the delegation, said the lapses
observed were mainly organizational, lack of uniformity in
election procedures and logistics.
</P>
<P>
The secret balloting in which voters had to thumb-print their
ballot papers secretly was observed in some polling centers, but
in most places voting was done in the presence of electoral
officers, said Wallace.
</P>
<P>
Wallace is the leader of the Americans for Democracy in Africa
and was in the country a year ago to observe the local government
elections on zero-party basis.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, the election process observed last weekend was
so transparent that "there is no way we can deny the legitimacy of the
process," she added.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the meeting lasted for more than two hours and
every member of the delegation was allowed to air his or her views
about the elections.
</P>
<P>
The Americans promised to properly brief their government on
their findings and make it see reasons why it should support the
transition program as well as open its door for dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The group, who arrived in Nigeria last Wednesday, comprises
journalists, publishers, religious leaders, political activists
and members of non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
They have been in various parts of the country to monitor the
election.

<HEADLINE> Multi-Million-Rand Worth of Smuggled Goods Seized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Millions of Rands worth of
smuggled goods had been seized by the Customs in the past year, but
constituted just a fraction of the products being brought illegally
into South Africa, the local daily the Citizen reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the budget hearngs in the National Assembly on
Monday, South African Revenue Services (SARS) Commissioner Trevor
van Heerden said the customs had been seriously neglected in the
past and needed to be upgraded.
</P>
<P>
Seven tons of clothing seized by the Customs had been sent to
Rwanda, while a tender had gone out for another nine tons to be
exported, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Van Heerden said only 3.5 percent of containers coming into the
country were being inspected in 1996, an improvement compared with the
previous years but well below the international norm of five percent.
</P>
<P>
He also said customs experts from the United Kingdom and the United
States played a major role in advising the SARS on how to beef up
controls at international airports and border posts.
</P>
<P>
An earlier report said the government was planning to launch a
nationwide campaign, including the restructuring of the customs and
exercise department, to wipe out smuggling and improve trade revenue
collection.
</P>
<P>
The government also planned to cut the number of international
airports from the present 36 to about eight, and the border post would
be reduced from 118 to 16.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, SARS Chief Executive Piet Liebenberg said the SARS had
recommended that for import purposes the number of airports and border
posts be limited to 10 and 16 respectively. enditem

-- About 5 million people in the 15 member countries of the
European Union are carrying the virus of hepatitis C, with one
fourth of them being threatened with cancer to be developed from
the epidemic disease. France is among the worst hit by the
epidemic, because of lack of screenings in blood transfusion in
the 1980s.

<P>
-- At the age of 66, former U.S. secretary of state James Baker
accepted on Monday an extremely difficult mission: be the personal
envoy of the U.N. secretary general for West Sahara to "restart

between Morocco and Algeria-supported Front Polisario.

Le Figaro:

<P>

adolescents of 18 years old living in families with more than three
children from January 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
-- In France, 7.5 percent of the staff of the armed forces are
women, which is among the highest in European countries. The
percentage of women serving in the country's air force is 11
percent, higher than in other military forces.
</P>

as is shown by the on-going crisis of the Renault auto group, the
Japanese automaker Toyota is considering to open a new assembly
plant with an annual production capacity of 200,000 cars in France
with a 1.6 billion U.S. dollar investment. The decision will be
announced on May 10.

People's Consultative Assembly and have no reservation in this
connection," he said.

<P>
"We would like to remind the Iranian side that the two
countries are Muslim and neighboring each other," said Saedi,
calling for turning over a new page based on mutual respect
between Iraq and Iraq and non-interference with the internal
affairs each other.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Sri Lanka's Local Government Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka will hold its
twice-delayed local elections on Friday in all but two provinces
of the country for 238 government bodies, and all election
campaigns will end at midnight today.
</P>
<P>
Nominations were handed in last month from a record 18,586
candidates seeking election to 3,567 seats in 12 municipal, 31
urban and 195 village councils.
</P>
<P>
The last local government elections were held in 1991. The
polls had been scheduled for 1995, but were postponed twice for
security reasons.
</P>
<P>
The coming elections are being held throughout the country
except in the northern and Eastern provinces where a civil war is
going on with the Tamil rebels fighting a 14-year-old war for a
separate state there.
</P>
<P>
There are a total of 9,737,970 eligible and 8,248 polling
centers.
</P>
<P>
Twelve political parties and 136 independent groups are
contesting the elections, but the main battle will be fought
between the ruling People's Alliance (PA) comprising seven
political parties and the main opposition United National Party
(UNP).
</P>
<P>
The current elections are regarded as a test for the PA
government which assumed office in 1994. The government's main
plank during the election campaign has been allegations of 17
years of misrule by the previous UNP government.
</P>
<P>
The opposition, on the other hand, is using its campaign to
highlight a string of broken promises by the PA government to
bring relief to the poor, bring down the cost of living, ensure
media freedom and abolish the executive presidency.
</P>
<P>
President Chandrika Kumaratunga is scheduled to preside over
the PA's final rally in Colombo this evening while the Opposition
UNP leader, Ranil Wickremesinghe, is also due to address the UNP's
rival rally.
</P>
<P>
Since early last month, incidents of election-related violence
including murder, shooting, assault and arson have been on the
rise islandwide. The most serious one occurred on February 11 when
PA District Member of parliamentarian Nalanda Ellawala was killed
in a clash between government supporters and their opposition
rivals.
</P>
<P>
Since early last month, there have been a total of 1,481
complaints of election-related violence from the seven provinces
where the local government elections will be held, according to
the Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
The UNP has made 656 complaints while the PA has reported 597
incidents. Many complaints were also made by other political
parties.

<TEXT>
<P>
Manila, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and the
National Democratic Front (NDF) today resumed their formal peace
talks in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government's chief negotiator, Howard Dee, said
in a press statement that the two parties will sign a number of
documents, including a supplemental accord to the Joint Agreement
on the Reciprocal Working Committees during the talks.
</P>
<P>
Negotiating panels from the two sides also agreed to complete
their work by June 30 to reach a "tentative comprehensive and
acceptable agreement," Dee said.
</P>
<P>
"Upon the approval of their respective principles, these
agreements shall constitute the final peace settlement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dee said the two panels will continue their discussions on
various issues in the agenda and are expected to reach the first
comprehensive agreement on March 22.
</P>
<P>
The two panels will also tackle the unfinished panel business,
particularly the completion of security arrangements, he said.
</P>
<P>
The NDF, a major leftist party in the Philippines, has been
opposed to the government since it was established in the early
1970s.
</P>
<P>
The group weakened considerably after the government launched a
series of military offensives against its New People's Army during
the late 1980s. Most of the NDF leaders have fled to the
Netherlands.

<HEADLINE> Curb on Illegal Skin Exports Urged in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has been urged
to immediately put in a system to check rampant illegal exports of
game skins which have been going on unabated for a long time.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by a leather company's Managing Director Peter
Gross in Ndola, Copperbelt, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
A news dispatch from Ndola quoted Gross as saying that Zambia is
losing millions of Kwacha (1,300 kwach equal one US Dollar) in
foreign exchange every month through illegal exports of game skins to
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Most dealers have engaged local poachers who kill game
indiscriminately for meat and skins. The same skins are later brought
into Zambia as finished products and fetch away much money.
</P>
<P>
The illegal exports have greatly affected operations of the local
leather industry which is lacking vital raw materials for various
products.
</P>
<P>
Gross called for the screening of some game hunters who are
allegedly involved in the scourge to deprive the local leather
industry of raw materials. enditem

<HEADLINE> Coffee Demand Expected to Outstrip Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Coffee Board of Kenya
predicted that the demand for coffee in the world is expected to
outstrip supply this year, keeping prices high in coming months.
</P>
<P>
In a market report issued here on Monday, the board said that
the main coffee producing countries continue to tighten supplies
while the major consuming countries have a record low stock.
</P>
<P>
The prices are expected to be kept high by a smaller crop from
Brazil, the world biggest coffee producer, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Prices at the weekly coffee auction have been rising and, last
week hit a new record of 357 U.S. Dollars per 50-kg bag
and the new price trend is expected to be maintained in the
coming months, it pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Sources here from the coffee sector noted that prices had
risen sharply at Kenya's weekly coffee auction in recent weeks
due to an anticipated supply shortfalls on the international
market.
</P>
<P>
The current drought sweeping the east African country will
reduce Kenya's coffee production to about 78,000 tons for 1996/97
crop year, the lowest level in four years.
</P>
<P>
In January, the board forecast coffee production at 85,000
tons this year compared to 97,575 tons in 1995/96 and 95,806 tons
in 1994/95.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is Africa's fourth largest coffee producer after Uganda,
Cote d'Ivoire and Ethiopia, according to figures from the
Abidjan-based Inter-African Coffee Organization.

<HEADLINE> Indo-Bangladeshi Friendship Treaty Expires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's much-talked 25-year
friendship treaty with India quietly expired today while a
high-ranking official commented, "Let there be no song and music
signifying the expiry of the agreement."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, before coming to power last June,
had announced that her party would not renew the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad recently said: "The treaty
automatically ceased to exist as it became unworkable after the
emergence of SAARC (the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation)."
</P>
<P>
Almost all major opposition parties have spoken against its
renewal. Some top leaders of the largest opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party on several occasions have even termed it as an
"agreement of slavery."
</P>
<P>
The treaty between the two neighboring countries was signed
amidst much fanfare and publicity 25 years ago by the then Prime
Minister Bangabandhu Mujibur Rahman, father of Sheikh Hasina, and
his Indian counterpart, Indira Gandhi.
</P>
<P>
Officially called the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and
Peace Between India and Bangladesh, the agreement was signed in
Dhaka on March 19, 1972, three months after the country's
independence.
</P>
<P>
During most of the last 25 years, relationship between the two
countries, however, has been frustrated by some controversial
issues such as sharing of common rivers, border crime and
insurgency.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Executive Director Mohamed
Abdel-Rahman of the African Regional Centre for Engineering Design
and Manufacturing (ARCEDEM) has said continued lack of capacity to
adapt and develop local technologies in African countries will
continue to impede economic development on the continent.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in a speech read on his behalf at a workshop
here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Because African countries could not develop their own
technologies they spend huge amounts of foreign exchanges on
importing machinery, equipment and spare parts thus draining the
continent's financial resources, he said.
</P>
<P>
Arcedem of Nigeria has designed and developed 30 kinds of
machines and equipment and trained 750 engineers and technicians from
43 African countries in the design and manufacturing of machine
elements and spare parts, production management and productivity
improvement.
</P>
<P>
At the workshop, Zambian Commerce, Trade and Industry Ministry
official Daniel Mauzu emphasized the need for industrial
support institutions disseminating information on new processes and
technologies to quickly establish links with small enterprises.

<HEADLINE> USAID Budget for African Programs Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The budget of the US Agnecy for
International Development (USAID) for African social programs has been
cut by 20 percent, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Alex Ross, a senior public health adviser of the USAID Bureau for
Africa, told reporters about the cut in Dodoma, central Tanzania at
the weekend at the end of his two-day tour of the Tanzanian AIDS
Project -- Dodoma Cluster Projects.
</P>
<P>
Ross said that the budget cut, however, did not affect the budget
of the health sector which includes the anti-AIDS and immunisation
programs.
</P>
<P>
Sectors affected in the budget cut were the economic growth and the
education, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The USAID adviser further explained that USAID annually spent
between 15 million and 80 million US Dollars in 30 African countries
in health programs, and worldwide the expenditure stood at 100 million
US Dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The number of Africa countries covered by the USAID financial
support fluctuated as we had to stop assistance to countries with
economic stability or involved in civil wars or coup d'etats," he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to Ross, countries that had ceased to be USAID support
beneficiaries included Zimbabwe, Botswana, Zambia, Burkina
Faso, Togo, Cote d'Ivoire and Cameroun while those not covered by the
USAID support included Zaire, Sudan and Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Among the current USAID beneficiaries are Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda,
Mozambique, South Africa and Malawi.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the USAID adviser said that countries that were most
affected by AIDS were Zambia, Zimbabwe, Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya.
</P>
<P>
While the AIDS growth rate in Zambia and Zimbabwe rose to about 20
percent a year, the rate in Botswana rose by about 10 percent. enditem

</P>
<P>
The relay fast in the eastern Nepali town of Damak, about 240
kilometers from here, is an effort to urge the ongoing session of
the U.N. Commission on Human Rights in Geneva to consider taking a
resolution on the issue, the Bhutanese refugee group the Appeal
Movement Coordinating Council (AMCC) said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
A delegation of hunger strike participants Monday also
submitted a petition to the U.N. session through the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) office in Damak.
</P>
<P>
Stating that the United Nations is their last resort, the
refugees in the petition appealed to the session of the U.N.
Commission on Human Rights to adopt a resolution on the Bhutanese
refugee problem in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 100,000 Bhutanese refugees have been staying in East
Nepal since 1990 when the Bhutanese authorities began to force
those of Nepalese origin to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
Seven rounds of bilateral talks between Nepal and Bhutan in the
last four years have failed to make any breakthrough in efforts to
repatriate the refugees.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Tensions are continuing to
mount between the Israelis and the Palestinians over today's
projected start of construction at Har Homa in the Arab East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The military authorities Monday night declared the Palestinian
areas from Bethlehem to Beit Sahur a "closed military zone", which
lies close to Har Homa in south Jerusalem. According to Israeli
law, without special permission anybody who enters the area will
run the risk of his life.
</P>
<P>
Army and police have also reinforced their deployment in
the West Bank in anticipation of violent Palestinian opposition
to the construction at Har homa.
</P>
<P>
At the construction site of Har Homa, army and police
units remain in standby in case of confrontation with
Palestinian protesters once the ground breaking begins.
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, Security forces threatened to remove the
protest tents set up by PLO Executive Committee Member Faisal
Husseini earlier in the day on the slope of a nearby hill
overlooking the Har Homa site.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu is due to hold a special
cabinet session to assess with relevant ministers and security
chiefs the situation in the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
Surveyors are expected to arrive at Har Homa this morning
to begin charting the land for a squadron of bulldozers that
are standing ready nearby. The bulldozers will likely start work
afterwards.

<HEADLINE> Southern African Maize Crop to Rise: SADC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Southern Africa could see a
second successive bumper harvest of maize in 1997 although dry
weather and excessive rains in some parts of the region could affect
production, the local daily the Citizen reported today.
</P>
<P>
A tentative maize harvest of between 16.28 million and 20.50
million tons has been forecast for 1997 compared to 20.34 million
tons last year, the report quoted a latest bulletin by Southern
African Development Community (SADC) as saying.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 crop could be almost double that of 1995 when drought
reduced production to 11.1 million tons, the bulletin said.
</P>
<P>
However, SADC said prospects for a good harvest in South Afrcia,
the largest maize producer in the region, have been dampened by the
intermittent dry spells experienced in many parts of the summer
rainfall region.
</P>
<P>
South Africa could produce a maize crop of between 7.5 million and
9.8 millions tons -- considerably down on the 1996 crop of 9.93 million
tons, the bulletin said.
</P>
<P>
In Malawi, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe, flooding following
incessant rains could also reduce the potential maize yield, the
bulletin said. enditem

<HEADLINE> Chinese Naval Ships End Visit to Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUMUT (MALAYSIA), March 18 (Xinhua) -- Two Chinese PLA Navy
ships left here today for Manila at the end of a three-day
goodwill visit to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that Chinese naval ships visited
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The ships, one missile destroyer and one missile frigate, were
under the command of Vice Admiral Yang Yushu, commander of the
East China Sea Fleet of the Chinese PLA Navy.
</P>
<P>
The ships were accorded a warm welcome upon its arrival on
March 15 at the Lumut port, Malaysia's largest naval base located
in its northwest state of Perak, about 288 kilometers from Kuala
Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
"We come for friendship, we come for promoting mutual
understanding and exchanges, and we come for strengthening the
friendly relations between the two armed forces and especially
between the two navies," Yang said in a written statement upon his
arrival.
</P>
<P>
The visit would surely further enhance the continuous
development of the friendly relations between the two peoples, two
armed forces and two navies of the two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Yang met Malaysian Navy Chief Vice Admiral
Ahmad Ramli Mohamed Noor in Kuala Lumpur and both stressed the
need for more exchanges of visits between naval ships of the two
countries to strengthen the friendly relations between the two
navies.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the Chinese naval ships to Malaysia, Ramli said the
visit "opened a new page in the modern history of our relations."
</P>
<P>
Yang also met Malaysian Fleet Operations Commander Rear Admiral
Mohd Hussain bin Tamby at the naval base to exchange views on the
development of their respective navies.
</P>
<P>
Both emphasized the need for promoting mutual understanding and
strengthening friendship between the two navies through exchange
of visits to make contributions to the cementing of friendship
between the armed forces of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese naval ships were opened to the public on March 16
for a limited period of three hours but attracted an unprecedented
crowd of about 20,000 people from different parts of Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
A Malaysian Navy officer, Suihimi Mahmood, who served at the
base for 19 years, said in an interview with Xinhua, "I am
surprised to see such a big crowd. Our base received naval ships
from a number of countries like Bangladesh, America, New Zealand,
France and they were also opened to the public, but there were
never so many people as today."
</P>
<P>
He said this showed the deep friendship between the peoples of
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During their stay, Yang and the commanding officers of the two
ships visited a Malaysian Navy ship which was berthed side by side
with the Chinese ships at the port.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese sailors also had friendship football and basketball
matches with their Malaysian counterparts to promote the
friendship between the two navies.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ships came here after visiting Sattahib, Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Rejects Netanyahu Summit Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat apparently nixed a summit Monday
night with Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, despite an appeal by
Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan and efforts by the United States.
</P>
<P>
According to Israel Radio this morning, Hassan met with Arafat in
Gaza Monday to deliver a message from his brother King Hussein
that Netanyahu is ready for talks. Hassan then phoned Netanyahu
and briefed him about the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Later in the evening, Netanyahu phoned Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak and told him of efforts to hold a meeting with
Arafat, but he said no date for a meeting had been set.
</P>
<P>
There will be no meeting unless Netanyahu agrees to freeze
building plans on Har Homa, on the southeastern outskirts of
Jerusalem, PNA Justice Minister Freih Abu Meddein said.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu Monday repeated his promise that work
would start on Har Homa to build a new Jewish neighborhood
this week, warning if the Palestinians violate their obligation
to refrain from violence, "there will be no peace process."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to coalition members of the Knesset (Israel's
parliament), Netanyahu said Har Homa would be a test of the
peace process. "We are not looking for confrontations, but
stand firm on our right to build there and we do not
need anyone's permission."
</P>
<P>
He said if Israel gave in on Har Homa and Jerusalem,
there would be no end to the demands and pressures. "Who
knows where it would end, not even with the 1967 borders."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in talks between Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
and PNA Planning Minister Nabil Shaath Monday, Arafat won
permission to fly in and out of Gaza without security
inspections for himself and his family.
</P>
<P>
However, security arrangements at the airport have yet to
be finalized for general air traffic.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai also promised to expedite safe passage arrangements
between the West Bank and Gaza Strip, for which the
Palestinians have waited more than two years.

<HEADLINE> Official: Ukraine to Seek its Own Security System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Moscow's policy toward Kiev was
forcing Ukraine to search for a system that could guarantee its
own security, a Ukrainian official told Interfax news agency today.
</P>
<P>
Some Russian actions and rhetorics were also pushing Ukraine to
decide on integration with Europe, said Vladimir Gorbulin,
secretary of the Ukrainian State Committee of Security and Defense.
</P>
<P>
Gorbulin made the remarks while commenting on an television
interview on Monday night by Ukraine President Leonid Kuchma, who
blasted Moscow's "continued aggressive policy" to Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
The Russian policy, said the president, was driving Ukraine to
abandon its position as a non-aligned country and acquire
membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
On his part, Gorbulin said today that there were good prospects
for furthering Ukrainian-Russian relations, and that his country
would explore new ways to resolve existing disputes with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an official of Russia's institute of European and
American studies voiced his opposition to NATO's preparation of an
agreement to forge a special partnership with Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
The NATO move, the official reportedly said, was designed to
exert pressure on Russia's long-standing position against the
Western military alliance's eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Gennady Udovenko is scheduled to
visit NATO's headquarters in Brussels on March 20 to hold the
first round of talks with NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana on
drafting the document on the special partnership.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Injects Huge Funds to Spur Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has decided
to allocate 25 billion baht (about 1 billion U.S. dollars) to
establish a fund to help the manufacturing sector upgrade
technology and increase exports.
</P>
<P>
The fund, one-fourth of which is to be contributed by the Thai
central bank, will provide needy manufacturers with low-interest
loans through the Export-Import Bank of Thailand and the
Industrial Finance Corporation of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Amnuay Virawan
said Monday that the interest rates for the loans would range from
9 to 10 percent with a repayment period of up to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The textile and food industries will be the first sectors to
receive the boost to modernize their production, said Amnuay, who
took the initiative to set up the fund.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers obtaining the loans must seek new technology and
equipment to replace outdated production facilities to compete in
the changing world market, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to estimates by the Thai Industry Ministry, the
textile industry in the country alone needs 2 billion baht (80
million dollars) this year for machinery modification and
replacement and it will need more in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said that apart from the 25-billion-baht fund,
the government is expected to seek 10 billion baht (400 million
dollars) in dollar loans and 5 billion baht (200 million dollars)
from the private sector to nurture the manufacturing sector during
the next four years.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that with the establishment of the fund, the
Finance Ministry is using its main weapon - soft loan facilities -
to foster the manufacturing sector and seek a new breakthrough in
reviving the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government earlier this year put hundreds of billions
of baht in the country's ailing property and finance sectors, but
no improvement has been seen so far, they added.

<HEADLINE> Athletics Australia Says Capobianco Needs New Evidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Australian sprinter Dean
Capobianco will damage athletics if he fights a four-year ban for
a positive drug test without new evidence, his national ruling
body said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Capobianco has said he would apply to the International
Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) to have the ban overturned
after repeatedly stating his innocence.
</P>
<P>
But Athletics Australia (AA) said the case has been properly
heard and, as it stands, it would not be in the sport's interests
for Capobianco to further challenge the IAAF ruling, which was
announced in Monte Carlo on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In announcing the ban, the IAAF said Capobianco tested
positive for the anabolic steroid stanozolol at a meeting in the
Netherlands last May.
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old sprinter escaped an automatic four-year ban
when a subsequent AA tribunal cleared him on the grounds that the
testing procedures had been seriously flawed. The IAAF opposed
that decision.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Agrees to Withdraw Lake's Nomination for CIA Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today accepted Anthony Lake's request to withdraw his nomination
as director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), CNN reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Lake, a former national security adviser,
sent Clinton a letter late today, asking him to withdraw the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
A ABC-TV report quoted unnamed White House sources as saying
that Lake was concerned that an assault by legislators on his
integrity, management skills and fitness to head the CIA would
simply continue unabated.
</P>
<P>
Lake is one of the final members of Clinton's second-term team
awaiting Senate confirmation, and the Senate Intelligence
Committee was due to resume its confirmation hearings for Lake on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lake's nomination triggered three days of tough questioning
last week. The questions included Lake's support for a secret 1994
policy that allowed Iranian arms to flow to Bosnia and his failure
to sell 280,000 U.S. dollars worth of energy stock after being
told to do so to avoid possible conflicts of interest.

<HEADLINE> Thai Company to Develop Deep-Sea Port in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Sahaviriya Group Corporation
Limited of Thailand is planning to develop a deep-sea port in the
area of Bokpyin in Myanmar's Tanintharyi division to link a
neighboring sea port of Thailand -- Bagn Saphan.
</P>
<P>
According to a memorandum of understanding signed here on
Monday between the Thai group and Myanmar Port Authority, a
feasibility study on the Golden Gateways Project for development
of two sea ports -- one in Thailand's Bagn Saphan on the Gulf of
Thailand and another in Myanmar's Bokpyin area beside the Andaman
Sea -- will be carried out.
</P>
<P>
Today's official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar said
Thailand's Bagn Saphan Port will become the eastern gateway while
Myanmar's Bokpyin Port is to be the western gateway.
</P>
<P>
The two sea ports, after connection by a land bridge consisting
of a highway, a railway and natural gas pipelines, will open up an
ideal avenue for commerce between the Middle East and Europe on
the one hand and the Far East and America on the other, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The study is expected to be finalized within six months and the
Thai group will build and operate the project under the BOT
(Built-Operate-Transfer) system if proved feasible, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Tachilek-Kengtung Road in Shan state of Myanmar
bordering Thailand is being upgraded with a Thai loan. The road is
to lead through Chiang Rai up to Bangkok and also be used as a
connection infrastructure to China.

<HEADLINE> Czech PM Criticizes Russian Ambassador's Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Czech Prime Minister Vaclav
Klaus today criticized Russia's ambassador to the Czech Republic
for saying that Russia would reconsider its economic relations
with the country if it persisted in trying to join NATO.
</P>
<P>
He said he was disgusted with the remarks made by Russian
Ambassador Nikolai Rjabov and was waiting to hear what the Russian
government had to say on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Klaus, who arrived in Budapest today for one-day visit, was
speaking at a joint news briefing with his counterpart, Horn
Gyula.
</P>
<P>
The Czech prime minister said he hoped the ambassador's remarks
were his personal view. If they reflected the Russian government's
stance, they would only fuel the Czech Republic's desire to join
the western military alliance, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic is one of several former Warsaw Pact nations
who want to join NATO. Leaders of the alliance's member-nations
will decide at a summit in Madrid in July which countries will be
the first to be invited to join.
</P>
<P>
But Russia is strongly opposed to NATO's eastward expansion
plans, saying the move east will threaten its security.

JINAN, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Shandong Province in east China is
speeding up the exploitation of its forest resources through
industrialization.
</P>
<P>
The building of forestry product bases has provided a material
foundation for the development of the province's forestry economy,
adding 10,000 ha of fast-growing forests in the past two years,
and 130,000 ha of economic forests and about 6,000 ha of flowers.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian House Passes Bill on Amendment to Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's House of
Representatives at a plenary session Monday passed a bill on
amendment to the 1996/97 state budget (ending March 31) into law,
parliament sources said today.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad said at the session that the
1996/97 state budget has been amended, adjusting it to more
effective and efficient ways of achieving development targets.
</P>
<P>
The state budget was originally envisaged to balance at 90.6
trillion rupiah (39.39 billion U.S. dollars), but was later raised
to 95.8 trillion rupiah (one U.S. dollar equals 2,340 rupiah),
including the surplus budget of 817.9 billion rupiah (340 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Mar'ie said the higher-than-estimated revenues were due to the
realization of oil revenues, estimated at 40.7 percent higher than
budgeted.
</P>
<P>
"The government thanked the house for its understanding of the
adjustments to the 1996/97 national budget, including its support
to the use of the current year's budget surplus and the use of the
proceeds of the sale of shares of state-owned companies to shorten
the period of payment of high-interest offshore loans," the
minister said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Though only 898.7-km-long, the
Nanning-Kunming electrified Railway, which completed track-laying
today, is one of the most important railway projects in China's
rail-building history.
</P>
<P>
Linking Nanning, capital of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region, with Kunming, capital of Yunnan Province, the trunk line
traverses the three underdeveloped but resource-rich regions of
Guangxi, Guizhou, and Yunnan in southwest China. The rail line is
part of China's strategy to tap the economic potential of the
central and western areas.
</P>
<P>
Connected with several major rails, the new line is a major
passage leading the inland southwest to coastal areas in the
southeast.
</P>
<P>
Known as "China's largest poverty-relief project", the railway
can benefit 15 million people still living under the poverty line,
which is a quarter of the country's total poor population.
</P>
<P>
Over perilous mountains and tortuous waters, the railway
negotiates an altitude differential of more than 2,000 meters. The
20-billion-yuan (2.4096 billion US dollars) railway is considered
one of the most technically-sophisticated railway projects of the
country, a miracle of Chinese railway construction.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Introduces Rule to Curb Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet has approved a
rule governing the quality of imported products in a bid to curb
import volumes, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The approval of the regulation proposed by the Commerce
Ministry came at a time when Thailand is opening its market to
more foreign products under its commitment to the World Trade
Organization and regional trade liberalization.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has regulations to identify the quality of products
for export, but no rules to identify the quality of imported
products, officials from the Thai Commerce Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The new rule will help Thai importers and consumers to receive
quality-guaranteed imported products, they noted.
</P>
<P>
The officials also said that with the new rule introduced,
Thailand will have a bargaining counter in trade talks with those
countries which want to restrict imports from Thailand by
requiring high quality products.
</P>
<P>
The Thai cabinet Monday only approved the principle of the
regulation and the ministry is working on the details.
</P>
<P>
The rule will initially target at those sensitive products like
beans, maize and soy beans, but it will cover luxury goods in the
future, according to the officials.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Different cities in Guangdong
province of south China are working hard to sell
government-subsidized flats as they accumulate public funds for
more housing construction.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, the province had sold 55,000
government-subsidized flats, with a combined floor space of 3.85
million sq m, and collected 1.52 billion yuan from the sales.
</P>
<P>
Some 19 cities and 39 counties use a public accumulative
funding system for housing, with the participation of over 20,000
organizations and 1.9 million workers, which has helped pool 1.8
billion yuan into a special fund for housing.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Shenzhen, Shantou, Shanwei, Zhuhai, Jiangmen,
Zhanjiang and Shenzhen have been authorized to try the state's
"comfortable housing" program -- building apartments for urban
families with moderate and low income. They have pooled 850
million yuan for the purpose and have constructed 820,000 sq m of
economic flats.
</P>

Individual buyers, the main customers of the open housing
market, make up 70 percent of the total volume of the commercial

urban construction project in Shenyang, and the first road project
in northeast China financed by Cheung Kong, which is owned by the
tycoon Li Ka Shing.
</P>
<P>
The Hongkong investment project will cover construction of an
18-kilometer and a 12-kilometer road and two bridges.
</P>
<P>
The whole project calls for expansion and renovation of 64
kilometers of roads, and the building of five flyovers, seven
underpasses, and 6.2 kilometers of suspended roadway, and is
expected to be completed by the end of November.
</P>
<P>
"The funding indicates that Cheung Kong considers Shenyang a
primary choice in its shifting of investment focus from southeast
coastal cities to the north," according to one source.
</P>
<P>
"If the cooperation proves successful, Cheung Kong will inject
more funds into transportation and environmental projects in
Shenyang," the source added.

<HEADLINE> Peru, Ecuador to Hold Talks on Border Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Delegations from Ecuador and Peru
are due to meet in Brasilia next month for talks to resolve the
remaining border problems between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The meeting has twice been postponed. The first meeting,
scheduled for January was cancelled as Peruvian Foreign MInister
Francisco Tudela was among the hostages being held by Tupac Amaru
rebels in the Japanese embassy in Peru.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was rescheduled for February but had to be
postponed again because Ecuador's President Abdala Bucaram was
sacked by parliament.
</P>
<P>
Both sides now hope to meet up on April 15, but no detailed
agenda has been made available.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is being brokered by Argentina, Brazil, Chile and
the United States, the four guarantors of the 1942 Rio de Janeiro
Protocol of Peace, Friendship and Limits which was supposed to
settle boundary disputes once and for all.
</P>
<P>
The half-century-old border dispute between Peru and Ecuador
flared up at the beginning of 1995 when the two countries staged a
month-long conflict over a disputed 340 square-kilometer zone in
the Cordillera del Condor, a remote stretch of the Amazon jungle.
</P>
<P>
Scores of soldiers died and hundreds were injured in the
fighting which ended with a truce guaranteed by the U.S., Brazil,
Chile and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
However, the threat of another military conflict hasn't
disappeared as both sides keep accusing each other of troop
incursions, air space violations, arms purchases and
misinformation campaigns.

<HEADLINE> Albanian Socialist Party Leader Urges Support for Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Socialist Party Chairman
Fatos Nano has called on all his countrymen to support the newly
formed national reconciliation government.
</P>
<P>
All parties including the Socialist party should give their
support to the new government to help restore order and peace, as
it is the key authoritative organ today that could make the
country return to normal, Nano told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Nano also said that President Sali Berisha should resign.
</P>
<P>
"Since the majority of protesters continue to demand his
resignation it means he hasn't got the message. I would prefer to
shake hands with him as an Albanian citizen and not as president,"
said Nano.
</P>
<P>
Nano, who was sentenced for 12 years of imprisonment in 1993 on
alleged corruption charges, was amnestied by President Berisha
last week.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist chairman, briefly prime minister in 1991, is
considered the major challenger to Berisha.

<HEADLINE> Austrian Parliamentary Leader on Austrian-Chinese Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Austrian National Council
(parliament) President Heinz Fischer said today he believed
China will enjoy peaceful and stable development, and make
new economic and social progress.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Chinese reporters before his visit to
China on March 24, Fischer hoped the two countries would resort to
all effective measures to strengthen economic cooperation, expand
personnel exchanges and promote cultural exchanges.
</P>
<P>
He talked about his five visits to China since 1974 and the
1994 visit to Austria by Qiao Shi, Chairman of China's National
People's Congress (parliament).
</P>
<P>
He said these visits showed that long-term, stable and
mutually-beneficial relations exist between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
On his visit to China between March 24 and 29, Fischer said,
"The year 1997 is an important year for China, in which senior
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping passed away (in February), China will
resume sovereignty over Hong Kong (on July 1), and the Communist
Party of China will hold its 15th National Congress (in October)."
</P>
<P>
"I will see with my own eyes the great changes that have taken
place in China over recent years," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"My biggest hope is to promote bilateral relations through
friend-to-friend dialogue and exchanges," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said that China, with its fast-growing economy, has
become an increasingly important market in the world, and there
are broad prospects for developing economic ties between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
In addition, there are no outstanding problems between Austria
and China, and Austria respects the choices made by the Chinese
people and China's policies.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of human rights, he said, "We understand that all
nations attach importance to the principle of not interfering in
other countries' internal affairs."

<HEADLINE> Inflation in Italy to Bottom Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Economic analysts predicted that the
current downward trend of Italy's inflation rate is likely to
bottom out in the second quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Morgan Staley, of the United States, forecast that the average
inflation rate for the April-June period would be 1.9 percent,
while U.S.-based J.P. Morgan predicted 2.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
Deutsche Bank, of Germany, forecast a year-on-year rate of 1.9
percent in April and 1.8 percent in May and June.
</P>
<P>
Analysts associated with the three prominent institutions said
the inflation in Italy would start to creep up in the second half
of the year on some technical and seasonal factors.
</P>
<P>
However, their estimate for a low point between 1.8 and 2.0
percent still meant that this year's average inflation rate will
probably turn out between 2.2 and 2.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian Justice Minister Outlines Corruption Crackdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Bureaucrats inherited from the
Soviet era are the main source of corruption in Ukrainian society,
Justice Minister Sergiy Holovaty said at a press conference here
today.
</P>
<P>
But not for much longer. Holovaty said this group will be the
main target of an anti-corruption drive by the ministry in the
summer as part of President Leonid Kuchma's "Clean Hands" campaign
launched last month.
</P>
<P>
He said the best way to rid the civil service of corruption was
by wholesale reform of the government's administrative
apparatus. "If ministries and agencies are not reorganized, they
will continue to be ruled by wholely corrupt mid-level officials,"
Holovaty said.
</P>
<P>
He admitted there was corruption in his own ministry and said
audits of the ministry's central and regional organizations had
revealed many cases of abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
Heads of some organizations had unilaterally increased their
own monthly salaries by nearly 1,000 hryvnas (about 550
dollars). Some used their official positions to secure second jobs
in other organizations and the private sector. But he gave no
further details.
</P>
<P>
Holovaty called for an overhaul of the nation's approach to its
judiciary and blamed lack of government money for the increase in
corruption. "The courts are now treated worse than any sector of
the economy," he said. "Meanwhile, the courts are the third branch
of government."
</P>
<P>
He called on the government to give the judiciary the same
level of support provided to the executive and legislative
branches.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the government allocated just 38 percent of the
money needed by the judiciary, a cut that Holovaty said had
encouraged corruption.
</P>
<P>
He said it is now usual for local officials and businessmen to
buy the loyalty of judges by paying to heat their courtrooms in
the winter or even fund the day to day running of the courts.
</P>
<P>
'Clean Hands' must apply first to the justice system and the
judiciary, otherwise it will end up being all talk and no action,
Holovaty said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, Singapore Agree to Boost ASEAN Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto and
Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong agreed that ASEAN economic
cooperation should be enhanced and that Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar
should join ASEAN, an Indonesian spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders, in a private meeting held Monday on Karimun
island in Indonesia's Riau province, said that with a membership
of 10 countries, the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian
Nations) region would be a market of more than 500 million people,
Indonesian State Secretary Moerdiono said last night after the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Moerdiono said, "500 million is a high figure, higher than the
population of Europe." Economic growth in the ASEAN region was an
average of six to eight percent per year, the official said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN currently groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto and Goh also agreed to further develop ASEAN's
potentials and heighten its member countries' competitiveness,
especially in attracting foreign investment, Antara news agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Moerdiono said the two leaders also discussed the future of
intra-ASEAN cooperation and agreed to assign some of their
ministers to make a study on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the talks, Soeharto and Goh launched a giant marine
and industrial complex.
</P>
<P>
The Karimun Marine and Industrial Complex is the third major
industrial project developed by the Singapore and Indonesia
private sectors.
</P>
<P>
Investment in the complex is expected to reach 142.8 million
U.S. dollars over the next 10 years. About half of it is already
in place in the project's first phase which covers an area of 155
hectares.

<HEADLINE> Hostage Crisis in Lima Deadlocked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The hostage crisis in Lima has
dragged on for three months but there is no sign of a quick
solution.
</P>
<P>
The talks between the government and rebels of the Tupac Amaru
Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) that is holding 72 hostages have not
actually been broken off but the date of resumption remains in
suspense.
</P>
<P>
The talks are being supervised by a commission of guarantors
set up to negotiate an end to the crisis and made up of
representatives from the Vatican and the International Red Cross,
the Canadian ambassador to Peru and the Japanese ambassador to
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The government has declared a preference for a peaceful
solution, as a rescue attempt might cost lives among the hostages
including President Alberto Fujimori's brother, senior government
officials, foreign diplomats and Japanese businessmen.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, who stormed Japanese ambassador Morihisa Aoki's
residence on December 17, have demanded the release of some 400
jailed comrades. They also wanted an end to the free-market
economic policies and more state support for the poor.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori has flatly rejected all the demands, promising not to
storm the building if the guerrillas released the captives and
laid down their weapons.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have insisted they would not surrender until their
comrades were released.
</P>
<P>
The MRTA command appears to be prepared to prolong the crisis,
while relatives of the hostages said that they have gone through
three months of anguish and suffering.
</P>
<P>
The denunciation on March 6 by Nestor Cerpa Carolini, chief of
the MRTA command, that government forces were digging a tunnel to
enter the compound and to annihilate the rebels interrupted the
dialogue initiated on February 11.
</P>
<P>
The guarantors worked feverishly tried to re-establish
communications between the government and the MRTA and even
negotiated a meeting, but Education Minister Domingo Palermo, who
is the government envoy, did not show up.
</P>
<P>
Palermo said conditions were still not ripe for any new
face-to-face contact and demanded that MRTA members clarify
several points.
</P>
<P>
After the 10th round of talks on March 12, the two sides agreed
that a period of reflection was necessary during which the
commission of guarantors will try to come up with alternatives to
make a solution feasible.
</P>
<P>
On March 2, Fujimori visited the Dominican Republic and Cuba to
request political asylum for the rebels occupying the Japanese
ambassador's residence, and Cuban leader Fidel Castro agreed to
offer asylum under certain formal conditions.
</P>
<P>
Nestor Cerpa, however, rejected Fujimori's proposal to allow
the MRTA command to leave Peru.

<HEADLINE> Financial Reform in Rural China Under Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- China will step up the ongoing
reform of its rural financial system in order to reorganize rural
credit agencies into co-operative organizations, China Daily
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Duan Xiaoxing, deputy director of the State Council
Interdepartmental Co-ordinative Group on Rural Financial
Restructuring, was quoted as saying that the basic tasks of the
reform were scheduled for completion by the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Grassroots and country-level rural credit co-operatives are
required to further standardize their operating systems, said Duan.
</P>
<P>
Self-disciplinary units within the co-operatives also need to
be founded as soon as possible to assure the healthy development
of rural co-operative financing, Duan said.
</P>
<P>
China now has 52,000 rural credit agencies which can date back
to 1951. They now support 80 percent of the nation's farmers and
70 percent of all firms in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
China started to reform the sector in 1983, when it found that
as organizations run by the Agricultural Bank of China, they
couldn't operate independently or play a more active role in
financing agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
Two basic steps have been defined by the government to realize
the reform of the rural co-operative financial system, according
to Duan.
</P>
<P>
The first step is to separate rural credit co-operatives from
the ABC, and the task had been accomplished in most of the
co-operatives by the end of last year, said Duan.
</P>
<P>
The second step -- which is what the credit co-operatives are
currently working on -- is to establish a rural co-operative
financial system.
</P>
<P>
Credit co-operatives are structured on the basis of a
co-operative system admit farmers and rural firms as members upon
payment of a set fee.
</P>
<P>
And all fee-paying members vote in co-operative decisions, no
matter the amount of money each contributed, which makes it
different from a shareholding system, Duan emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Credit co-operatives are organized primarily to provide
financial services to their members. However, members can also
earn profits in proportion to their current deposits in the
co-operatives.
</P>
<P>
As Duan explained, much of the reform is devoted to
constructing a democratic management composed of a congress of
members, a board of directors that would elect the head of the
credit co-operative, and a supervisory commission.

<HEADLINE> EU Team Arrives in Crisis-hit Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- A top-level mission from the
European Union met Albania's Prime Minister Bashkim Fino for talks
on Monday to try to help the new government for national
reconciliation end the anarchy in the Balkan state.
</P>
<P>
The 11-member team, led by Dutch roving ambassador Jan de
Marchant et d'Ansembourg, flew into Tirana by helicopter from the
southern Italian port of Brindisi.
</P>
<P>
The team's primary task will be to help the Albanian
authorities recover administrative control over the country which
has been engulfed in violent protests for the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
EU foreign ministers turned down Albania's call for military
intervention but at a meeting on Sunday pledged to help the
country "restore civilian structures and law and order".
</P>
<P>
The European delegation will report back on the composition of
a planned advisory mission of experts on civil reconstruction,
police and military matters and humanitarian and financial
assistance.
</P>
<P>
The team is also expected to visit the west coast ports of
Durres and Vlore, key bridgeheads in any relief aid operation,
during its two-day stay. About 6,000 Albanians have fled across
the Adriatic Sea to Italy from these two ports.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said no meeting had been planned with
President Sali Berisha, whose resignation has been a key demand of
the rebels who have taken control of several towns in the south.
</P>
<P>
At least 100 people have died in more than a month of unrest
sparked by the collapse of the pyramid investment schemes in which
thousands of Albanians lost their life savings. The protests
mushroomed into a lawless anti-government revolt with widespread
looting of arms from army depots.
</P>
<P>
But there are signs that things are starting to return to a
semblance of normality. Although a state of emergency and a dusk
to dawn curfew are still in effect, shops in Tirana were open
again after five days of turmoil, public transport is running and
public employees obeyed a government order to return to work.

<HEADLINE> China to Standardize Manufacturing, Use of Pesticides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese health authorities will
working out national guidelines to standardize pest-elimination
approaches and restrict the manufacturing, keeping and use of
pesticides in the country, according to a report in today's "China
Daily".
</P>
<P>
The National Committee for Patriotic Health Campaigns (NCPHC)
-- in co-operation with other state departments in charge of
agriculture, the chemical industry and industrial and commercial
administration - is carrying out nationwide inspections of
pesticides including rat poisons, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The drive is expected to stamp out pesticides that have done
more harm to people than to pests and to recommend some safe
chemicals for the public.
</P>
<P>
The NCPHC's expert committee for pest elimination recently
granted certificates to 25 products. A total of 38 varieties of
pesticides including rat poisons were submitted for approval
during the first-ever action.
</P>
<P>
Anti-epidemic institutes across the country are being asked to
use only NCPHC-licensed pesticides, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
A report from the NCPHC said many township units and
self-employeed traders are manufacturing and selling unauthorized
poisons, ignoring bans and warnings against such products from ten
ministries and commissions since 1984.
</P>
<P>
Sixty percent of the 57 rat poisons, which were tested by the NCPHC
last year, were found to contain acutely poisonous chemicals
banned by the state.
</P>
<P>
"Such acute poisons kill relatively few rats as many such
rodents have learned to avoid them. But the widespread use of
unapproved poisons has cost human lives," the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
From 1989 to 1992, Beijing City, Hebei and other four provinces
registered 164 poisonings including 12 deaths of the people who
ate the pesticides by mistake, it said.

<HEADLINE> Panama to See Lunar Eclipse on Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Astronomy buffs in Panama
will get double treat on Sunday with the simultaneous occurrence
of a lunar eclipse and the appearance of the Hale-Bopp comet.
</P>
<P>
The eclipse will begin at 9.58 p.m. local time Sunday and end
at 1.21 a.m. on Monday, according to the Panama Canal Commission.
</P>
<P>
A lunar eclipse occurs when the earth passes between the moon
and the sun, blocking the sun's rays. But this will only be a
partical eclipse because the earth's shadow won't completely
obscure the moon.
</P>
<P>
At 11.39 p.m. local time, "only a very thin rim will be seen
over the orange face" of the moon, a color that will become
brighter in the shadow of the earth, the Panama Canal Commission
said.
</P>
<P>
The eclipse will be visible to the naked eye but experts say
buffs will get a better view if they use binoculars.

<HEADLINE> Rare Lampblack Ink Found in 800-year-old Tomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- A piece of rare lampblack ink
dating back 800 years has been found in a tomb in Jintan city in
east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
The ink, 13 cm by 2.5 cm by 0.8 cm, bears inscription of
"Youyan" (lampblack) and of the ink maker.
</P>
<P>
It is, according to the experts, "as shining as lacquer and as
hard as jade."
</P>
<P>
Historical records have shown that China's ink-making can be
traced back to the Shang Dynasty (16-11th Century BC) and reached
its peak in the Tang (618-907) and Song (960-1279) dynasties. But
few inks from the peak period remain.
</P>
<P>
The ink was found among over 50 relics in two tombs from the
Northern Song Dynasty (960-1127). The other relics include a
writing brush, a black-glazed vase with plum design, gold earings,
a silver hair pin, a bronze mirror, and different lacquers.

<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Two 2,000-year-old engraved stones
with images of the gods of spring and autumn have been found in
northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists say that the stones are the first of
their kind ever found in the country.
</P>
<P>
The God of Spring, Gou Mang, appears on a 1.03-m-high stone,
and has a human face and a bird's body. His left hand holds a red
sun with a black bird with three legs in it, and his right hand
holds a torch.
</P>
<P>
Green dragons, the symbol of wood, the east, and spring in
traditional Chinese culture, can be found under his feet and
behind him.
</P>
<P>
The God of Autumn, Ru Shou, also with a human face and a bird's
body, was carved on a 0.69-m-high stone. He has a snake in his
ears, a white moon with a toad with three legs, in his right hand
and a compass-like object in his left hand.
</P>
<P>
White tigers, the symbol of gold, the west, and autumn, are
found under his feet and at his back.
</P>
<P>
The two stones were among more than 60 engraved stones found at
13 tombs dating back to the Han Dynasty (206 BC-220 AD) in Shenmu
county in Shaanxi. They portray popular Chinese legends and
stories and were painted in a variety of colors such as pink, red,
white, brown, green, and purple.

Details such as human hair, strings on musical instruments,
carriage ornaments, and blood from a dog bite can be clearly seen.
</P>

ROME, March 17 (Xinhua) -- One in four Italian households and
nearly one in three children under 15 lived in poverty, a Bank
of Italy report published today says.
</P>

poverty line. Of the families living in poverty, 15.5 percent had
one child, 23.1 percent had two children, and 49.5 percent had
three or more children. Single-parent families are particularly
at risk, with 40.3 percent of them living in poverty.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Members Call for Conserving Historical City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Members of Guangzhou City
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) have made many proposals over the past few
years for protecting local cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou, the largest city in south China, has a more than
2,000-year history and a great number of cultural relics,
including city walls and imperial palace remains from the Qin
(221-206 BC) and Han (206 BC-220 AD) dynasties, a cemetery of
modern revolutionary martyrs, and old shops and stores that are
still in use.
</P>
<P>
Historical sites have, however, been threatened by large-scale
urban construction work and rapid economic growth over the past
decade. So, to deal with the situation, local CPPCC members
studied the problem, put forward proposals, and helped deal with
parties involved in relics-related disputes.
</P>
<P>
As a result of these efforts, the city government allocated
some 30 million yuan for a local company to move out of a building
used by China's first president, Sun Yat-sen, and to put it under
state protection.
</P>
<P>
A great number of historical sites under city protection have
been renovated and old shops and stores have been given priority
in moving back to original sites under construction.
</P>
<P>
Pushed by CPPCC members, the city decided to allocate some
eight million yuan for conservation of cultural relics and another
three million yuan for cultural relics collections each years,
from 1997 on.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- A New Zealand company claims
it has invented a new engine which outperforms conventional rivals
by virtually every measure, a local press report said today.
</P>
<P>
"This engine scores on every single aspect you measure engines
on - it's lighter in weight, it's easy and very cheap to make,
it's incredibly powerful, it's very low on emissions and it's
extremely fuel-efficient," claimed co-inventor Graeme Jerkins.
</P>
<P>
A small New Zealand company, Continuous Cycle Engine
Development (CCED), owns world patents and licensing rights of the
product.
</P>
<P>
The report said that two years ago, Ford NZ assessed the engine
and was interested enough to send details on to Ford in Detroit,
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Ford NZ initial inspection showed that the engine "had some
merit."
</P>
<P>
CCED has signed a memorandum of understanding with China's
Sichuan Donghua Machinery Works, which will manufacture the
engine, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Donghua has bought the technology and the deal includes a
licensing arrangement where CCED gets royalties based on the cubic
capacity of each unit produced, according to the report.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Latin America's banking sector
consolidated last year, with mergers and acquisitions (M&AMP;A) worth
4.8 billion U.S. dollars taking place, a study released today
shows.
</P>
<P>
The deals were made to strengthen banks' capital base and
enable them to face the radically different competitive scenario
which emerged following Mexican financial crisis in 1995, a study
by the Santiago Chamber of Commerce said.
</P>
<P>
Bank privatizations accounted for 16 percent of the value of
the M&AMP;A. European banks were also active on the financial scene,
some like Banco Santander expanding, some cutting back on their
Latin American operations.
</P>
<P>
In Chile, bank M&AMP;As worth 1.25 billion dollars took place last
year, accounting for 26 percent of the total value of bank M&AMP;As in
the region.
</P>
<P>
The most important operations in Chile were: Banco Santander's
purchase of Bancosorno for 495 million dollars and the merger
between the O'Higgins Bank and the Santiago Bank which created an
institution with more than 630 million dollars of assets.

<HEADLINE> Becker Leaves Germany for Good, Papers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 17 (Xinhua) -- German newspapers reported that
tennis star Boris Becker was leaving Germany for good on Monday,
flying to his home in the United States.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman at Frankfurt airport confirmed Becker was on his
way to Miami and that his wife Barbara, 31, and son Noah, 3, had
already left on Saturday on one-way tickets to Florida.
</P>
<P>
The triple Wimbledon champion said late last year he wanted to
move to the United States in about three years' time. But after
tax investigators raided his Munich house in December in his
absence, an angry Becker warned he could leave sooner.
</P>
<P>
The mass-circulation daily Bild said Becker had put his car up
for sale, that Noah's room in their villa was empty and that the
family had spent a farewell evening with Becker's parents.
</P>
<P>
Becker said last year he wanted to move to the United States
when his son Noah started school, so that the boy would avoid the
pressures in Germany of having a famous father and of not being
white.
</P>
<P>
Becker said he and his wife, who is black, believed their son
would be able to lead a more normal life in a multi-racial
society.

<HEADLINE> Pianegonda captures Tirreno-Adriatico lead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Gianluca Pianegonda of Italy came
from behind in the past two days to take the overall lead after
Monday's fifth stage competition in the Tirreno-Adriatico cycle
race.
</P>
<P>
The Italian colocked 20 hours 29 minutes and 32 second in the
first five stages.
</P>
<P>
Pianegonda finished the 187-kilometer fifth stage in the same
time as the pack and Italian Robert Petito but, assisted by his
team-mates, managed to pick up a two-second bonus on a day which
saw former world champion Maurizio Fondriest pull out.
</P>
<P>
Italian Andrea Ferrigato won the 5th stage with a time of four
hours 39 minutes and 15 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Fondriest, the 1988 road race world champion, pulled out
complaining of back pains, casting some doubt over whether he
would be competing in the Milan-San Remo classic on March 22. He
had been 11th overall, two minute and 49 seconds behind.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's hilly sixth stage is 168km to Montegranaro.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The legislature of China's island
province of Hainan has formulated 81 local laws and regulations
since the island became a special economic zone eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
The laws and regulations have helped form a legal framework
which facilitates the building of a socialist market economy,
according to officials with the Hainan Provincial People's
Congress.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the congress passed 20 laws and regulations on
gasoline tax, autonomy for the Li and Miao ethnic groups in
Baoting county, blood donations, and recruiting soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Approved by the National People's Congress, the Hainan People's
Congress has also adopted a regulation on law firms to link the
province with the regular international practice.

<HEADLINE> Kwan, Lipinski Win Groups in Figure Skating Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAUSANNE, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Americans Michelle Kwan and Tara
Lipinski took their qualifying groups in the World Figure Skating
Championships here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kwan had to scale down three jumps but was good enough to top
the 15 qualifiers in the group and advance to Friday's short
program. Saturday's long program ends the competition.
</P>
<P>
Kwan, bidding to defend her world title, is expected to meet a
strong challenge from 14-year-old Lipinski who snatched the
U.S. national championship from Kwan last month.
</P>
<P>
Lipinski looked in top form as she matched her seven-triple
jump performances that she used in winning the American title and
the Champions Series final.
</P>
<P>
Lipinski had another triple loop-triple loop combination --
something no other woman has ever done -- and looked solid on the
others to gain scores in the 5.7-5.8 range with a 5.4 mark.
</P>
<P>
Chen Lu of China, who narrowly lost to Kwan at last year's
world championships, finished a poor 11th with a disastrous
routine during which she singled out at four jumps and fell once.
</P>
<P>
In the men's qualifying on Monday, Todd Eldredge beat Elvis
Stojko in one group in a battle between the world champions of the
last three years.
</P>
<P>
Alexei Urmanov topped fellow Russian Ilya Kulik in the other
group with both completing quadruple jumps.
</P>
<P>
The main competition begins Tuesday with compulsory dances and
the pairs short program.

SHENZHEN, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The local legislature of
Shenzhen, China's special economic zone in Guangdong Province that
borders Hong Kong, passed 18 local laws and regulations last year,
and more will be adopted this year, according to a local

They cover management of the Futian bonded zone, tourism,

<HEADLINE> Clinton Meets With Primakov for Summit Preparation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov said today following his meeting with President
Bill Clinton that Russia would not change its position on the NATO
enlargement despite the pressure from the West.
</P>
<P>
"Russia will not change its position on the NATO enlargement.
But Russia understands that NATO is real force, and Russia would
like to have normal relations with NATO, which would serve the
cause of normalizing stability in Europe," Primakov said in the
White House driveway after his nearly one-hour talks with the
president.
</P>
<P>
Primakov believed that there should be a document with binding
character so that there could be normalized stability in Europe.
</P>
<P>
He was echoing President Boris Yeltsin, who said Sunday that
Russia had made "enough concessions to the United States," and it
was the "U.S. turn to move in order to preserve our partnership."
</P>
<P>
The Russian president insisted that he would demand a legally
binding treaty barring Western forces from ever deploying in
Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Like Yeltsin, Primakov, while emphasizing the unchanged
position of his country, wished that the United States could make
some change in its position toward the NATO enlargement.
</P>
<P>
"If the U.S. position on this one would change, I would applaud
it," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Primakov, who arrived in Washington Saturday for talks with
U.S. officials in preparation for a summit meeting in Helsinki,
Finland, between President Yeltsin and President Clinton, held
discussions with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Defense
Secretary William Cohen before meeting with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
State Department Spokesman Nicholas Burns said the
Primakov-Albright meetings were "interesting, cooperative and, in
some instances, productive." Bu he declined to elaborate the
meetings.
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry said after the
Clinton-Primakov meeting that they reviewed issues in three large
areas: European security; the future of arms control; and the
economic engagement that the West has with the Russian Federation.
</P>
<P>
McCurry acknowledged that there was no progress made on the
issue of NATO enlargement as both sides would not change their
position on it.
</P>
<P>
"There's still work to be done," he told reporters. "I can't
imagine that we will solve all the issues that are pending."
</P>
<P>
"There is a substantial amount of work that needs to be done to
clear away the residue of the Cold War period," he said. "A large
part of the work of this summit will be about that."
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-Russian summit has been pushed back on day as Clinton
is still recuperating from a knee surgery.

<HEADLINE> Mark Up on Worries About Single Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar fell against the
mark and ended mixed in other currencies today after a number of
senior German officials hinted that Europe's plans for single
currency might be delayed.
</P>
<P>
In New York, the dollar settled at 1.6894 marks, down from
1.6935 marks Friday. The dollar settled at 123.66 yen, up from
123.38 yen, due partly to the yen's weakness against the mark.
</P>
<P>
The demand for marks had the worst effect on the British pound,
which tumbled against most currencies and hit the lowest level
against the dollar since mid-October. In late New York trading, the
pound cost 1.5888 U.S. dollars, down from 1.6010 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York compared with late Friday:
1.4585 Swiss francs, up from 1.4570; 5.6995 French francs, down
from 5.7130; 1,693.00 Italian lire, up from 1,688.50; 1.3708
Canadian dollars, up from 1.3628.

<HEADLINE> UN Secretariat Stages Comprehensive Structural Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Secretariat staged today comprehensive structural and
organizational reforms, with Secretary-General Kofi Annan
announcing the integration into one of three departments for
economic and social affairs.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, the secretary-general said the new
secretariat arrangements should serve to bolster support for
Africa's development, South-South cooperation and the sustainable
development of small island developing states.
</P>
<P>
"Resources will be reallocated; departments integrated;
administrative costs reduced; functions streamlined; new methods
of work introduced; and maximum performance demanded of all
staff," said the secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
The three departments to be merged are the Department for
Policy Coordination and Sustainable Development, the Department
for Economic and Social Information and Policy Analysis and the
Department for Development Support and Management Services.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the latest efforts by the secretary-general to
reform the United Nations in areas that fall within his
authorities. Previous measures included the creation of a policy
coordination group, an executive coordinator for U.N. reform and
reform groups by all relevant entities.
</P>
<P>
In staging the comprehensive structural and organizational
reform, the secretary-general also proposed a 123 million U.S.
dollar cut for the regular budget for the biennium 1998-1999
compared with the previous biennium. In this connection, he
proposed a reduction of approximately 1,000 posts in the program
budget for the biennium 1998-1999.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he proposed establishment of a new Department of
General Assembly Affairs and Conference Services, integrating
major technical support services for the Assembly, the Economic
and Social Council and their subsidiary bodies.
</P>
<P>
To show more emphasis on development issues, the
secretary-general said he would cut one third of the proportion of
regular budget resources used for administrative and other
non-program costs, by the year of 2001, and make the savings
available for development activities.

NEW YORK, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Blue-chip issues on Wall Street
turned higher, but technology and smaller-company shares slid
today as interest rates edged toward 7 percent in the bond market
amid inflation worries.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average recovered from an 81-point
deficit to gain 20.02 to 6,955.48 at its closing.
</P>
<P>
Decliners outnumbered advancers by nearly a 2-to-1 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with NYSE volume totaling 494.43
million shares as against 486.96 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list rose 2.54 to 795.71, and
the NYSE's composite index rose 0.57 to 418.37.
</P>
<P>
But there were still sizable losses in the Nasdaq market and
other sectors dominated by technology and smaller-company shares.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index fell 13.54 to 1,279.43, having
recovered from a 26-point plunge. The American Stock Exchange
composite index, which also consists of a large amount of
technology issues and smaller companies, fell 4.23 to 596.24.
</P>
<P>
As bond prices fell today, the yield on the 30-year Treasury
bond rose from late Friday's 6.94 percent to as high as 6.98
percent before settling at about 6.95 percent. The long-bond yield
hasn't been above 7 percent since September.

<HEADLINE> James Baker Named UN Envoy for Western Sahara </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. Secretary of
State James Baker was named today as the personal envoy of U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan for Western Sahara
</P>
<P>
There has been long standing conflict between Morocco and the
local independent force of the Polisaria guerrilla movement over
Western Sahara since Spain withdraw in 1976.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Annan said Baker would assess whether the U.N.
plan of holding a referendum on the territory's future could be
implemented in its present form, whether adjustments acceptable to
the two sides might be possible or whether other ways of resolving
the conflict could be found.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Baker is a most distinguished statesman. He enjoys a high
international reputation and commands universal respect. His
appointment has been warmly welcomed by the parties," the
spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
He said Baker expected to visit the region soon for talks with
the Moroccan government, the leadership of Polisario and the
governments of Algeria and Mauritania, neighboring countries
closely involved in the issue. Polisario's main base is at
Tindouf, on the Algerian side of the border with Western Sahara.
</P>
<P>
Baker was secretary of state under President George Bush from
January 1989 to August 1992. He was secretary of the treasury from
1985 to 1989 under President Ronald Reagan and served as Reagan's
White House chief of staff from 1981 to 1985. He is a senior
partner in the law firm of Baker and Botts, with offices in
Houston and Washington.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after the announcement of his
appointment, Baker said, "I am pleased to do what I can to help
resolve this issue, and will explore with the parties all viable
options.... I will travel to the area next month for initial
contacts with the parties involved."

<HEADLINE> Sudan Accuses Uganda of Launching Military Actions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Minister of Foreign
Affairs Ali Osman Mohamed Taha today accused Uganda of seeking a
resolution of its border problems with Sudan in the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here, the Sudanese minister denounced
that "Uganda's aggressions against Kaya and Bazi have clearly
revealed that Uganda is pursuing its aggressive policy towards
Sudan."
</P>
<P>
He returned Sunday from the Ugandan capital city of Kampala
where a meeting of the foreign ministers of Iran, Sudan, Uganda
and Malawi called for by Iran late last week.
</P>
<P>
The meeting had not achieved any positive results.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese minister said at the press conference that despite
the efforts exerted to activate the situation, matters are still
at a standstill. However, an agreement has been reached on
convening another round of talks in Tehran during the first half
of this year.
</P>
<P>
The policy of Ugandan government in resolving bilateral
differences was categorically rejected, he said.
</P>
<P>
He called upon the Kampala government to withdraw its forces,
saying that the Sudanese rebels with the help of Uganda were in
control of the towns of Yei, Kaya and Bazi as well as other
garrisons as reported by foreign news agencies.
</P>
<P>
Sudan and Uganda have an old border conflict, and Sudan is
accusing Uganda of supporting the Sudanese opposition forces in
their military fight against the Sudanese government troops which
has erupted last January.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today voiced his intention to examine the partnership between
Russia and the United States during the summit meeting scheduled
for March 20-21 in Helsinki, according to Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with reporters, President Boris Yeltsin said
that there have not ever been such a difficult summit meeting
between Russia and the Unites States. The questions to be
discussed at the summit "are of principled character for Russia,"
Yeltsin noted.
</P>
<P>
The president said that he and U.S. President Bill Clinton will
examine "how far" the trust between the two countries has
progressed since th end of the cold war and "to what extent our
partnership is reciprocal."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said, "We must be facing each other and say why our
partnership is one-sided, why the anti-dumping restrictions are in
effect against Russia, why, against Russia's wishes, the United
States intends to hold exercises in the Black Sea, why Russia is
not a part of different world structures because of the U.S.
position, why Russia has not been recognized as a country with a
market economy although 70 percent of its economy is now in the
private sector."
</P>
<P>
The president also stressed the necessity at the summit to
discuss the problem of American investments in the Russian
economy, in which the United States "takes the place far from the
first."

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Armed Forces of the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) are considering the purchase of
diverse arms and are examining related offers by certain
countries.
</P>
<P>
This was announced here today by Colonel Obeid al Kutbi,
spokesman of the International Defense Exhibition (IDEX-97) which
opened in Abu Dhabi Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference at the exhibition grounds
that the UAE Armed Forces were considering offers for the
purchase of arms for the UAE land, sea and air forces. He said
the outcome would be announced in the course of the IDEX-97 or
sometime later.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman revealed that the UAE Armed Forces had concluded
ever since the IDEX-95 several military contracts worth 2 billion
U.S. dollars for the purchase of arms and equipment.
</P>
<P>
He said that competition was still on among US, French and
British companies for a deal of 60 to 80 warplanes, adding that a
decision by the UAE would be taken at the appropriate time after
thorough examination of the offers.
</P>
<P>
Asked about a possible deal for the purchase of six speed
naval patrol boats, the spokesman said that naval arms and
equipments were under consideration and the appropriate decision
would be taken shortly.
</P>
<P>
The IDEX-97 is currently taking place here and will
probably offer the opportunity for the UAE Armed Forces to
purchase the weapons it needs after careful comparison of the
arms and military equipment from various countries.

LONDON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Rolls-Royce and Associates, part
of the Rolls-Royce Industrial Power Group, was today nominated
sub-contractor to design and supply the reactor plants for the
Royal Navy's next order for Hunter Killer submarines.
</P>
<P>
Rolls-Royce and Associates will be part of a team of companies
working for GEC Marconi, the prime contractor for the Batch 2
Trafalgar Class submarines, according to a press release here by
the Industrial Power Group.
</P>
<P>
The contract for the nuclear steam raising plant will be the
largest single order ever won by Rolls-Royce and Associates, who
design, supply and support all the navy's nuclear plants.
</P>
<P>
The company would supply three PWR2 plants over the next 10
years together with spares and in-service support, the press
release said.
</P>
<P>
They will be fitted with the latest long-life reactor cores,
designed to operate for the life of the submarine, eliminating the
need for costly reactor refueling.
</P>
<P>
Testing of the first of the new cores will begin at the Vulcan
Naval Reactor Test Establishment at Dounreay in Scotland during
2000.
</P>
<P>
This testing forms part of another major contract awarded to
Rolls-Royce and Associates by the Ministry of Defense last month.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Will Remain Stable, Prosperous After </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 17 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official in charge
of Hong Kong affairs today assured German businessmen that Hong
Kong will remain stable and prosperous after being returned to
China on July 1 of 1997.
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered to over 100 German businessmen today in
Bonn, Lu Ping, director of China's State Council office in charge
of Hong Kong and Macao affairs, said that China's commitment to a
stable and prosperous Hong Kong has been clear for quite some
time.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it is not only in the interests of Hong Kong,
but also in the interests of China as a whole, to practice the
policy of "one country-two systems" in Hong Kong and let "Hong
Kong people govern Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
"China, in opening its economy to the world, needs a capitalist
enclave like Hong Kong to serve as a window to the Western world,
and vice versa, the Western world can also use Hong Kong as a
bridge to enter into the uncharted market on the mainland," Lu
said.
</P>
<P>
Lu also made it clear that China will hold on to the principles
laid out in the Basic Law of Hong Kong which seek to preserve the
Hong Kong way of life that has been the key to its success.
</P>
<P>
"While some people may have been skeptical about whether those
principles would be fully carried out, I think recent events have
shown those concerns to be unfounded," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
He said that as July 1 is approaching, people are more and more
convinced about the sincerity of the Chinese government in
carrying out the provisions under the Basic Law, which will serve
as a mini-constitution for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Lu also expressed the confidence that Hong Kong will remain
attractive for foreign investment and will remain the business
center of Asia and a world-class financial center after 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Political and economic stability, a reliable currency, a sound
legal system, and a favorable tax regime are all important factors
which will allow Hong Kong to maintain its position as a great
place to live in and the best place to invest in," he said. He
added that Hong Kong's stability and new relationship with China
mean that the investment environment will only get better.
</P>
<P>
"Now it is time (for foreign businessmen) to participate in the
prosperity and the economic opportunities that will continue well
beyond July 1 of this year," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Before making the speech, Lu met with German Minister in the
Chancellor's Office Friedrich Bohl. Both sides stressed the
importance of a smooth transfer of power in Hong Kong in order to
ensure its position as the economic and financial center of Asia.
</P>
<P>
Bohl also stressed Germany's continuing interest in Hong Kong
and expected that his country's economic link to Hong Kong will be
further deepened.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey revealed today by German economic
representative in Hong Kong Ekkehard Goetting, over three quarters
of German companies based in Hong Kong are confident that the
political and economic situation in Hong Kong will remain stable
or even be improved after 1997.

<HEADLINE> US Urges Palestinians Not to Resort to Drastic Actions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- With Israel and the
Palestinians preparing for a showdown over Israel's decision to
begin building a Jewish neighborhood in east Jerusalem, the United
States today urged the Palestinians not to take any action
involving violence.
</P>
<P>
"There can be no justification for anyone firing a gun or
throwing a bomb," State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said
at a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the situation in the Middle East "is troubled"
as the Israeli government "is going ahead" with the plan to break
ground Tuesday for 6,500 Jewish homes in historically Arab east
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Burns just repeated the U.S. position over the Israeli housing
construction, saying, "We don't think it was a good idea."
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has criticized the Israeli
government for the move, but when the issue went up to the U.N.
Security Council, its representative vetoed a resolution to
condemn Israel for its violation of the Israeli-Palestinian
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly of the United Nations later overwhelmingly
passed the resolution against the U.S. will.
