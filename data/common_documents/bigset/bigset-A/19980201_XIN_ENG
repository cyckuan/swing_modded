<HEADLINE> Kuchma Satisfied with Meeting with Yeltsin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid
Kuchma on Saturday said that he and Russian President Boris
Yeltsin have no differences on any issue, according to the
Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving Moscow for Kiev, Kuchma said he was in an
"excellent mood" after his informal meeting with Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma said he has reached an agreement with Yeltsin on issues
related to the transit of Turkmen gas across Russia to Ukraine. He
said that Russian shipments to Ukraine are insufficient and that
Ukraine "needs additional gas."
</P>
<P>
On Russian-Ukrainian relations, Kuchma said the main problem
"for all these years was the Black Sea Fleet." Now that "this
knot has been unraveled," all efforts must be concentrated on
further development of bilateral relations, Kuchma said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the development of the Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS), the Ukrainian president said "this union is still
needed," but its viability "depends on ourselves and no one else."
</P>
<P>
The main base for further development should be the "economic
component," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma voiced his supports for Russia's position on the Iraqi
problem.
</P>
<P>
"The clear-cut and tough position of Russia is justified," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Ukraine had been disputing on the issues of the
Black Sea Fleet since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. The two
countries' relations became better when the Russian and Ukrainian
premiers reached an accord on the Black Sea Fleet in Kiev in May
1997.

<HEADLINE> Iran Wastes 4 Billion Dollars in Energy annually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Annual energy waste in Iran
stands at 7,000 billion Rials (4 billion U.S. dollars), the
Persian daily Iran reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Automobiles and factories are the major sources of the waste,
Mohammad Rahmati, director general for energy affairs of the
Planning and Budget Organization, told the daily.
</P>
<P>
The world standard energy consumption for a car is 4-5 liters
of fuel for 100 kilometers, while the figure in Iran is 10-25
liters, he said.
</P>
<P>
Due to the high consumption of energy, Iran wastes nine dollars
for producing one tonne of steel and 100 dollars for producing one
tonne of aluminum, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran is one of the countries with the highest level of
energy waste in the world.
</P>
<P>
This phenomenon has set off serious concern of Iranian
officials, who have warned that the country will have to stop
exporting oil in 15 years with the current energy consumption
growth rate.
</P>
<P>
An official said earlier this month that Iran's daily fuel
consumption had increased by about 200 percent to 1.5 million
barrels of oil from 509,000 barrels during the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Iran's proven oil reserve stands at 93 billion barrels. It is
allowed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Counties to
produce 3.94 million barrels per day, of which 2.5 million barrels
are exported.

<HEADLINE> Gaullist RPR Holds Conference to Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 31 (Xinhua) -- France's Gaullist movement, the
Rally for the Republic (RPR), began a two-day conference Saturday
aimed at adopting a new political project to adapt the party to
the evolving political situation at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
In a message sent to the conference, President Jacques Chirac,
who is from the RPR, said that France "needs more than ever the
ideals of the Gaullist movement."
</P>
<P>
He called on RPR politicians to rally behind its new president,
former parliament speaker Philippe Seguin, a hawk in confronting
the Socialist-led majority and the government of Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Seguin accused Prime Minister Jospin of
"not governing but wavering" in his social and economic policy.
</P>
<P>
The daily Le Figaro, which is the mouthpiece for the RPR, said
that Gaullist militants will promote the idea of economic
liberalism and a free and dynamic economy in France, which they
think is the only way to tackle unemployment and guarantee social
cohesion in the face of economic globalization.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,280 Turkish
Cypriots Saturday crossed the Green Line into the
government-controlled south for a pilgrimage to Hala Sultan Tekke
Mosque in Larnaca on the southeastern coast.
</P>
<P>
Around 28 buses, provided by the Greek Cypriot side, took
the Turkish Cypriots to the Hala Sultan Tekke to celebrate Eid
El-Fitr, marking the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
The Hala Sultan Tekke, located on the shore of Larnaca's Salt
Lake, was built in memory of Umm Haram, an aunt of Prophet
Mohammed and is considered one of the holiest Islamic Shrines.
</P>
<P>
Last year Turkish Cypriots were also allowed on several
occasions to cross the U.N.-controlled Greek Line to visit the
Turkish Cypriot enclave of Kokkina, in the northeastern part of
the island, and pay a pilgrimage to Hala Sultan Tekke mosque
in Larnaca.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,650 Greek Cypriot pilgrims were also permitted
on two occasions to visit the Apostolos Andreas Monastery, at
the Turkish-controlled eastern tip of the island.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of visits was agreed upon by Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash during
their meetings in Nicosia Earlier last year.
</P>
<P>
This East Mediterranean island has been divided into Greek
Cypriot-dominated south and Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since
1974 when Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern
third of the island in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in
Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
People from the two sides have been prohibited to cross
the 180-kilometer-long U.N.-controlled buffer zone which separates
the island into two parts.

CAIRO, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
Saturday called for a solution to the Iraqi crisis, the Middle
East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The international community should make further efforts to
resolve the crisis, Mubarak said in an interview with the local
daily Al-Akhbar.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that military operations against Iraq would
aggravate the tension in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The current crisis came as Iraq denied the access of arms
inspectors of the United Nations Special Commission in charge of
eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction to presidential
palaces for reasons of national sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The United States has threatened to launch military strikes to
force Iraqi compliance with the U.N. Security Council resolutions.

people while saying that it is not appropriate to launch a

<HEADLINE> Somali Factions Reach Agreement on Opening Air, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The Somali factions meeting
here on Saturday have reached an agreement on opening air and
seaports in Mogadishu and the abolishing of all the green lines
that bisected the capital in the past seven years.
</P>
<P>
The meeting which took place at Hotel Kah at Yaqahid district
was attended by nearly one hundred politicians, traditional
leaders and religious scholars led by Ali Mahdi Mohamed, Hussein
Mohamed Aidid and Osman Ali Atto.
</P>
<P>
Outside the hotel were thousands of cheering people and dozens
of technical vehicles from all sides waiting for the outcome of
the meeting and eager for a peaceful settlement in the capital.
</P>
<P>
As the meeting was concluded in the afternoon, the faction
leaders held a joint press conference which was attended by local
and international media representatives.
</P>
<P>
On the security issue, Ali Mahdi said at the press conference
that all armed clan militiamen will be demobilized into
designated camps and a collective security force with one
commanding center will soon be formed to safeguard the security
in the capital.
</P>
<P>
"Mogadishu should be unified and pacified in every sense in a
common administrative body very soon," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Mohamed Aidid said that the pacification of the
capital and the formation of a common administration for
Mogadishu is key to the Baidoa National Reconciliation Conference
due to be held in mid February for the formation of a government
of national unity.
</P>
<P>
According to Junior Aidid, a long lasting solution is in the
reach of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
"The opening of the air and seaports of the capital will also
facilitate the international efforts in helping the flood, famine
and diseases stricken communities of Somalia," he added.
</P>
<P>
Faction leader Osman Ali Atto stressed that no more words are
remained, but work.
</P>
<P>
"We now crossed to the stage of the implementation for the
Cairo meeting," he said.
</P>
<P>
The faction leaders have also invited 30 members from each of
the Hawiye clans to attend the one-day conference on Monday at
the same hotel.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the meeting were a large delegation from the
Egyptian government led by Mohamud Mustafa, the Egyptian
ambassador to Somalia, and representatives from the Arab league
who are observatory guests.
</P>
<P>
This has been the first such meeting held jointly by
Mogadishu's politicians after the Cairo meeting.

<HEADLINE> UK, US Imminent for Fundamental Decisions on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Britain and the United States
warned Iraq today that all options, including the use of military
force, remained open if it did not comply with U.N. weapons
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The message came after U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook met in London.
Albright flew into London from Madrid earlier today to consult
with her British counterpart on the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a joint news conference with Albright after their
meeting, Cook said the time was nearing for "fundamental decisions
to be made."
</P>
<P>
Albright said the two countries "stood shoulder to shoulder"
over the crisis, which she said was very grave.
</P>
<P>
"The window is narrowing.... It looks as if diplomacy is not
working," Albright added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary of state, on a mission to Europe and the
Middle East to win support for possible U.S. strikes on Iraq,
later left for Israel and for talks with Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Albright warned, "We further agreed that the only standard for
a real diplomatic solution is full Iraqi compliance with the
Security Council and unconditional, unfettered access for UNSCOM
(arms inspectors)."
</P>
<P>
The deepening row between Iraq and the United Nations hinges on
Baghdad's dispute with inspectors searching for documents and
materials related to its weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
The inspectors have said they are convinced Iraq, which has
blocked them from eight "presidential sites," is concealing
evidence. But Iraq argues it has no nuclear, chemical or
biological weapons or ballistic missiles banned under terms of the
cease-fire ending the 1991 Gulf War in which U.S.-led forces drove
Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Italian Textile Factory to Launch Joint Venture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 31 (Xinhua) --The MCM Textile Industry,
an Italian private company, is to launch a joint venture to
establish a ginning, spinning and textile factory in northern
Ethiopia with two Ethiopian partners at a cost of 30 million U.S.
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
MCM Board Chairman Giovanni Lettieri today told Ethiopian
Prime Minister Meles Zenawi that the factory will be established
in Gondar Town and that the joint venture will be undertaken by
MCM, Caroga Food, and Beeverage and Endeavour, reported the
Ethiopian News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Giovanni said the availability in the Gondar Town of raw
materials (including cotton ) has made possible the establishment
of the joint venture.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the volume of cotton the factory needs
annually is 84,000 tons while only 30,000 tons of the item can be
produced in the area.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Meles said that his government will extend
necessary support to investors who are engaged in the development
of cotton plantations in the area with a view to boosting
production.
</P>
<P>
Meles said, ''What Ethiopia lacks is not raw materials but the
market. If we get the market, we will do everything possible to
boost production.''
</P>
<P>
MCM, estalbished in 1826, employs 1,200 people in Italy and
India and is engaged in the production of yarn, garment and
non-woven materials.

LONDON, January 31 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair today branded Iraqi President Saddam Hussein an "evil
dictator" and urged the West to get ready to take military action
against him.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said Saddam's games and attempts to divide

Saddam had to be stopped from hanging on to his weapons of mass
destruction and a diplomatic solution was not the only option to
stop him, he warned.
</P>
<P>
He added Britain and its allies would continue to look for
every way possible to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis
over Iraq's refusal to allow U.N. weapons inspectors free access
to suspected arms sites.
</P>
<P>
"It is vital for us to stop this evil dictator hanging on to
his remaining weapons of mass destruction or acquiring more," he
said.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Junta on Alert Against Alleged ECOMOG </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The military junta in Sierra
Leone has ordered all security personnel in the west of the
country, including the capital Freetown, to be on the alert.
</P>
<P>
The announcement, made by the Defense Department broadcast
first by the State Radio Friday night, gave no reason for the
move, the British Broadcasting Corporation reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
However, there has been speculation of possible military
strike against the junta by the west African peacekeeping force
known as ECOMOG, the report said.
</P>
<P>
But a junta spokesman said Saturday that the move was made
"because of the latest development that Nigeria is now resorting
to terrorism".
</P>
<P>
According to him, Nigerian soldiers serving in ECOMOG based
near Freetown have abducted a number of members of a Guinean
delegation which is on a fact-finding mission in the capital.
</P>
<P>
The people were abducted on a highway on the way back to their
own country, he alleged.
</P>
<P>
But so far no protest has been heard from Guinea over the
abduction of its citizens in neighboring Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The military government would not be afraid of anything
Nigeria can do to it, the spokesman said, adding the crisis in
the country could only be settled through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
He also claimed that Nigeria, which is reported to be the core
of ECOMOG, and ousted President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah were going to
use force for the final resolution of the Sierra Leone crisis,
disregarding the existing peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord signed last October in Conakry, Guinea, the
junta is to hand over power to Kabbah on April 22. But the junta
leader, Johnny Paul Koroma, has said the deadline is unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
Both the United Nations and west African countries, which have
imposed sanctions against the junta, are opposed to the change of
the deadline, and the former is to send military observers to the
country to monitor the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the civil defense group loyal to Kabbah, known as
the Kamajors, have been fighting for the restoration of the
ousted president in the eastern part of the country bordering
Liberia.

ABU DHABI, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates has
expressed optimism about the oil prices, the WAM news agency
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Oil and Mineral Resources of the UAE Obeid bin Saif
Al-Nasir told the WAM that he believed the world oil market will
recover after months of slump.
</P>
<P>
Al-Nasir's remarks came when world oil prices climbed to 16-17
dollars a barrel in the last four days from the lowest level of
14.78 dollars a barrel in 45 months.
</P>
<P>
Most oil-rich Gulf countries have based their 1998 budget on an
oil price at 16-17 dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that the concern about a military
confrontation between the United States and Iraq, which would
disrupt Iraq's oil export, led to the increase of the oil price.
</P>

The U.S. has threatened to launch a military strike to force
Iraqi compliance with the United Nations Security Council

<HEADLINE> Jordan Calls for Negotiations to End Iraqi-UNSCOM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Jordan Saturday called on the
concerned parties to end the crisis of arms inspection in Iraq
through negotiations rather than military confrontation, Jordan's
official news agency Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has insisted that the crisis between Iraq and the United
Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) be settled by negotiation, not
confrontation, to save the Iraqi people from tragedy and death,
Jordanian Minister of Foreign Affairs Fayez Tarawneh told the
Petra.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has expressed hope that negotiations and international
efforts would also help the UNSCOM exercise its mission without
any breach of Iraq's national sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM is to certify the elimination of Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction before the U.N. Security Council can lift the
sanctions imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has barred UNSCOM's inspectors from searching for the
banned weapons in presidential palaces for the reasons of national
security and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
And the United States has threatened to launch a military
strike to force Iraqi compliance with the U.N. Security Council
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's policy is based on the principle of solving conflicts
through "peaceful means and dialogue" instead of "resorting to the
language of destruction," the Jordanian foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
He called on the concerned parties to continue "diplomatic
efforts" to implement the U.N. Security Council resolutions,
which he said would help avoid "dangerous escalation" of the
crisis.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's exports
earnings rose to 81.5 million U.S. dollars in last December,
respresenting an increase of 12.6 percent over the previous
month.
</P>
<P>
In its monthly report, the Bank of Tanzania (BoT) said that
the earnings from traditional exports went up 31.2 percent, while
earnings from non-traditional exports increased 4.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
In December, earnings from the exports of most traditional
products increased in terms of both volume and prices, the BoT
said, with an exception of sisal, whose exports volume declined
by 76 percent.
</P>
<P>
Non-traditional export earnings increased from 23.8 million US
dollars in November to 24.8 million US dollars in December.
</P>
<P>
The increase has been attributed to high export earnings from
petroleum products, manufactured goods and other exports.

"Minerals, cotton, yarn, fish and fish produce, manufactured
tabacco and horticulture products recorded lower earnings when
compared with their respective receipts in the previous months, "
says the bank report.
</P>
<P>
However, when comparison is made between the December of 1997
and the corresponding period in the previous year, earnings of
traditional exports and non-traditional exports dropped 13.7
percent and 29.2 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The decrease in earnings from traditional and non-traditional
products has been caused by heavy rains which have played havoc
with both crops and transportation network.
</P>
<P>
On annual basis, the report says that export earnings for the
year of 1997 dropped by 5.6 percent from the previous year.
Earnings from traditional exports decreased to 360.5 million US
dollars from 447.3 million US dollars recorded in the previous
year.

<HEADLINE> East China Province Benefits From Foreign Expertise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Fuzhou Mawei Shipyard, a
century-old vessel manufacturer in Fuzhou, capital of Fujian
Province, has become a major exporter in this east China province,
with the help of foreign experts.
</P>
<P>
The shipyard is one of the local institutions that have
benefited from the province's strategy to introduce more foreign
expertise to boost the local development.
</P>
<P>
Fujian introduced more than 1,500 foreign experts in the last
seven years, and 513 projects have been launched in the province.
Three-fourth of the projects are in agriculture, key projects and
high-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture has been given top priority for foreign expertise
by the local government. Since 1993, Japanese experts have been
invited to give on-the-spot instruction on growing high-yield rice
paddies.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Japanese technology has been spread on more than
800,000 hectares of paddy fields to increase the output by 705
kilograms per hectare, which has resulted in an increase of more
than 1 billion yuan (120 million US dollars) for local farmers.

WASHINGTON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers Sunday:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- After talks with Madeleine K. Albright, Britain's Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook said he would ask for a Security Council
resolution to find Saddam Hussein "in breach of his obligations."
The request could be made this week and would precede an military
attack on Iraq. It may be coupled with an expansion of the
oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
-- Iran's president, Mohammad Khatami, is by far the most
popular man in Iran. But just a few months after his election, he
is surrounded by extraordinary obstacles. He lacks a knowledge of
economic affairs, and is without a political apparatus. He is
confronted by powerful enemies, and the constitution gives supreme
authority to another ayatollah.
</P>
<P>
-- Asia's financial crisis may well result in a greatly
expanded American business presence in Asia. Experts say the
Americans may find an open door in banking and other areas.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton has never been more popular with the
American people, despite the controversy now surrounding him, and
the country is feeling better about itself than it has in more
than two decades, according to a new Washington Post poll. The
nationwide poll, conducted Wednesday through Saturday, found that
67 percent of those interviewed said they approve of the job he's
doing as president.
</P>
<P>
-- In the budget plan he will submit to Congress Monday,
President Clinton will propose a package of tax and spending
measures he estimates will generate a 9.5 billion dollar surplus
in fiscal 1999, and nearly 1 trillion dollars in surpluses over
the next decade.
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton announced Saturday a five-year, 6.3
billion dollar package of tax incentives and research to spur
development of ultra fuel-efficient automobiles and other
energy-saving technologies.

<HEADLINE> WCU Studies SADC Regional Water Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The World Conservation Union
(WCU) has embarked on a study of water management in the Southern
Africa Development Community (SADC) countries, the WCU said in a
statement released here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
With financial assistance from the Swedish International
Development Agency, the WCU said it was undertaking an 18-month
regional research to investigate and establish water demand
management application in the region.
</P>
<P>
The research would be based on five case studies to be
conducted in South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Mozambique and
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The conventional approaches to water management had been to
build elaborate dams to meet the demand for supply, and in
general water had been under-priced, leading often to the abuse
and inefficient use of the resource.
</P>
<P>
Given that supply is likely to be limited, and the building of
dams now becoming an expensive option for countries of the
region, the WCU said there was a need to explore different water
management strategies.
</P>
<P>
The WCU said sustainable water resource management was an
important element of regional security and internal stability and
the region needed to develop effective mechanisms of managing
water.
</P>
<P>
''Water demand is a crucial concern to the countries of the
region because of the increasing human population and associated
demand for resources which require water, especially food,'' the
WCU said.
</P>
<P>
''Some states are already water stressed due to prolonged
droughts or low and unreliable rainfall and while others will
experience water scarcity in the not too distant future,'' it
said.
</P>
<P>
The water demand management (WDM) is a management approach
that aims to conserve water by controlling demand.
</P>
<P>
It involves the application of selective economic incentives
to promote efficient and equitable use of water as well as a
number of water conservation measures.

<HEADLINE> Lithuania, Estonia Become EU's Associated Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The agreements on associated
membership of Lithuania and Estonia in the European Union (EU)
went into effect on February 1, the Interfax news agency reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The two Baltic countries and the EU signed the agreements in
June, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Darius Dehutis, a senior official of Lithuania's Foreign
Ministry, said that the de jure status of Lithuania's associated
member of the EU marks the beginning of a new stage in Lithuania's
integration with the European organization.
</P>
<P>
The EU is opening new opportunities for the movement of goods,
services, capital and workforce with Lithuania, the official added.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, Lithuania actively took part in
multilateral cooperation with the EU. Statistics showed that the
EU accounted for 33 percent of Lithuania's exports before October
1, 1997, while the EU's share in Lithuania's imports stood at 44.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
Estonia also regarded the event as an important step to create
conditions for full integration with the European organization.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong CPPCC Suggests More Cooperation With Hong Kong, Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 1 (Xinhua) -- How to promote all-around
cooperations and exchanges among China's southern province of
Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao became a hot topic for members of
the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
At the first session of the Eighth CPPCC Guangdong Provincial
Committee that was held recently, participants set forth many
pertinent opinions on this issue. They also urged a higher level
of cooperation between Guangdong and the two regions with the
return of Hong Kong and Macao's imminent return.
</P>
<P>
Some Hong Kong and Macao members said an improving investment
environment and legal system as well as true national treatment to
investors will make them more confident about the province.
</P>
<P>
Since the reform and opening-up drive was launched in late
1970s, Guangdong has entered its "golden age" of economic
growth. Overseas funds worth over 81 billion U.S. dollars have
been introduced into the province, with 80 percent of that from
Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
As many Guangdong CPPCC members from Hong Kong and Macao are
investors in the province, they encouraged the provincial
government to continue introducing funds to maintain its fast
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Referring to high-tech development, they said, it is vital to
restructure industries and upgrade products in the province, and
to encourage such high-tech industries as electronic information.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Rejects Western views on Economic Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has rejected
views by certain Western observers that the economic downturn and
currency crisis faced by Asian countries is due to weak
management, corrupt practices and other negative elements,
according to an official media report.
</P>
<P>
"This outlook suggests that all negative elements are linked to
the East and the West is free from such weaknesses like
safeguarding businesses and cronyism, free from corruption and
social ills," the Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim
told reporters Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Hari Raya (Festival of Fast-breaking) open house
at his residence in northern Malaysia, Anwar said if the will is
there among the world community, including the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, to resolve these
weaknesses, then the community should do so with courage and
determination and not just rely on the developed nations alone,
the Bernama news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"They need not hide the fact that inequality and injustices
also occur in the West and they spring from an unfair
international system of trade," he said.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said the West should not deny that injustices favor rich
nations which make use of these to protect their own interests.
</P>
<P>
All factors should be taken into consideration for discussion
on world equality so that a fairer, more accurate discourse could
be reached, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This must be stressed upon because all our statements on
negative elements are related to developing nations. No nation
should be deemed most efficient. All countries should change,
progress and mature," Anwar added.
</P>
<P>
"We should help each other, not out of fear, if we are to have
an environment that is conducive to change," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad had visited Indonesia
and will visit Singapore, the Philippines and Thailand to
formulate a combined strategy to improve the regional economic
situation.

<HEADLINE> EU Concerned Over Zambia's Extension of State of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
expressed deep concern over Zambia's extension of the state of
emergency for another three months and urged the government to
complete investigations and charge or release all detainees.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released Saturday in Lusaka, the EU urged the
Zambian government to investigate the allegations of torture made
by some of the detainees picked up in connection with last year's
abortive October 28 coup, according to Sunday Times of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
"The European Union now strongly urges the government of
Zambia to complete their investigations with all possible speed,
to charge or release all the detainees and to end the state of
emergency at the earliest opportunity," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
On the extension of the state of emergency by parliament last
week for another three months, the EU pointed out that it had
hoped the probe into the coup would be completed within the
initial 90 days period of the state of emergency as the extension
would entail continued suspension of basic human rights.
</P>
<P>
However, the state-owned English paper quoted Homes Affairs
Minister Peter Machungwa who defended the parliament's decision
of the extension as saying Saturday that the Zambian government
is responsible for the security of its people and therefore wants
to do a "thorough and professional" job.
</P>
<P>
He added that it is not the wish of the government to delay
the investigation but the limited available resources and the
complexity of the case has caused the extension.
</P>
<P>
The state of emergency was declared by President Frederick
Chiluba last October to facilitate the investigations into the
failed coup but it is required to review and ratify by parliament
every three months.
</P>
<P>
Under the state of emergency, more than 90 people including
former president and opposition leader Kenneth Kaunda have been
detained and no one has been tried until now.

<HEADLINE> Croatian Priest Murdered in Rwandan Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 1 (Xinhua) -- A Roman Catholic priest from
Croatia, father Vjeko Curic, was assassinated in Kigali Saturday
night, the office of Rwandan Capital's police has said.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian priest who was in his forties has been living in
Rwanda for over 17 years, a release of Rwanda News Agency sent
specially for Xinhua said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He was vicar of Kivumu Parish, of Kabgayi Diocese in Central
Gitarama Province of Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Sources from Kabgayi have indicated that he was very much
involved in the reconstruction of his Diocese of which he was the
treasurer.
</P>
<P>
Much of the work related to the construction of houses for the
genocide survivors and the returnee in collaboration with the
Catholic non-governmental organizations (NGOs).
</P>
<P>
He reportedly saved many lives during the 1994 genocide which
claimed about one million Tutsis and Hutus lives from the
opposition who had sought refuge at Kabgayi.
</P>
<P>
"We have no clue about the identity of the murderer," the
Kigali Police told Rwanda News Agency, adding that investigations
have already started.
</P>
<P>
It is further reported that father Curic was shot dead by a
man who was travelling with him in his vehicle near Sainte
Famille Church, located near the main city round-about.
</P>
<P>
Security forces which rushed to the site of the crime found
eight pistol bullets in the father's body.
</P>
<P>
The murder of father Curic follows that of other clergy
people: a Belgian nun, a Canadian priest, and three sisters from
the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
Although no one has been so far arrested in connection with
the murder, well-informed sources in Gitarama have indicated that
father Curic had been receiving many death threats before.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, he miraculously escaped from an assassination attempt
at his residence in Kivumu.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the local army commander had provided him with an
armed guard that was watching over his home at night.
</P>
<P>
Armed Hutu militia, including remnants of the army of the
Hutu government overthrown in 1994, have been carrying out
attacks in Northern Rwanda in recent months, targeting Tutsis
and allied Hutus.
</P>
<P>
The conflict is a legacy of centuries of division between
the majority Hutu and the minority Tutsi who ruled Rwanda until
the monarchy was toppled in 1959.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of Tutsis fled into exile after the
monarchy was kicked out, but many returned after a Tutsi-led
armed group, which invaded from neighboring Uganda in 1990,
took power in 1994.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Tibet
Autonomous Region attracted a record high 350,000 travelers from
home and overseas last year.
</P>
<P>
The gross earnings for the tourist industry are estimated at
400 million yuan (48.2 million U.S. dollars), including 30 million
U.S. dollars, up 18 percent and 7 percent respectively over
1996. Pre-tax profits are expected to hit 37 million yuan (4.45
million U.S. dollars), up 12 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Tang Zhengqi, director of the tourism administrative bureau of
the Tibet Autonomous Region, attributed the increased profit to
the hard work and responsibility of the region's 4,000 staff
members engaged in the travel sector, as well as the economic
growth and social stability in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The local tourism departments intensified their market
promotion activities last year and started to publicize Tibet in
other parts of China and Southeast Asian countries, while
maintaining its traditional European and American markets.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the region established a department to supervise
tourism services, which has been a hit with travelers.

HANGZHOU, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Markets of various kinds
continue to expand, in a stable and healthy manner, in east
China's Zhejiang Province in the past year, according to the
provincial administration on industry and commerce.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, the province had established 4,488
marketplaces, 2.28 percent up over the previous year. Of them, 79
were productive means markets such as those dealing in real
estate, labor and intermediate agencies.
</P>
<P>
Last year, local commodity markets saw a total trading volume
of 279.8 billion yuan, up 9.93 percent year-on-year, while the
total transactions of local productive means markets reached 6.27
billion yuan, increasing by 20.07 percent over 1996.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, local authorities made great efforts to improve the
quality of markets by standardizing market activities and stepping
up macro-control over them so as to ensure their orderly
development.
</P>
<P>
Some markets that had failed to attract dealers and buyers were
closed down by the authorities, and, on the other hand, a number
of modern markets were built up in the province.

<HEADLINE> Rural Poor Decreasing in Chongqing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- A total of 1.1 million of the
rural poor in southwest China's Chongqing Municipality have risen
above the poverty line and are leading better lives because of
effective poverty relief measures.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing once was a city in southwest China's Sichuan
Province, but became the country's fourth municipality last March.
</P>
<P>
This young municipality has 21 poverty-stricken counties, with
a poor population of 3.66 million who are mainly living along the
Yangtze River and in the mountainous regions of Wuling and Daba
mountains. Transportation is inconvenient in these areas and the
agricultural infrastructure is backward.
</P>
<P>
To help more poor people lead better lives, the municipal
government mobilized more than 200 government departments and
institutions to form 21 separate poverty relief teams. Each team
was assigned tasks and goals in helping a specific
poverty-stricken county.
</P>
<P>
By the end of November, the poverty relief teams had helped
raise 230 million yuan for the poverty-hit areas, local sources
said. They also started 281 poverty-relief projects and helped
build 20 Project Hope primary schools.
</P>
<P>
The municipality has also adhered to the practice of executing
poverty relief work through development projects, and has
intensified construction of the agricultural infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Since last year, the municipality has invested 500 million yuan
in building roads, taming rivers, constructing power
stations, improving soil conditions and growing trees in these
areas.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Chongqing has vigorously spread application of
agronomics in its impoverished rural areas. Last year it sponsored
66 training courses for 6,000 poor farmers and spread the use of
70 practical farming techniques.
</P>
<P>
Advanced agricultural techniques have now become major factors
for poor farmers in the municipality to increase output and
income. Science and technology are credited with 40 percent of the
municipality's increased agricultural output.
</P>
<P>
Different areas have also grown many cash crops in accordance
with local conditions and engaged in processing businesses to
increase added value, said local sources.

BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- China today urged the United

interfere in the other countries' internal affairs.
</P>

When Asked to comment on the part concerning China in the

<P>
In conformity with the universal principles and China's
specific conditions, he said, the Chinese government has made big
efforts to realize the people's rights of subsistence and
development, kept improving the people's standards in enjoying
their political, economic, social and cultural rights while
protecting their rights of citizens and political rights in
accordance with law.
</P>
<P>
These efforts have brought about the unprecedented, all-round
improvement and continuous development of the people's human
rights conditions in China, Zhu noted.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, in disregard of the above-mentioned facts,
the US government, passing itself as the "guard of human rights,"
made irresponsible comments and fabricated unwarranted charges
upon China's human rights conditions while not uttering a single
word about cases of seriously violating human rights in its own
country.
</P>
<P>
"This is a typical example of applying dual standards on human
rights issue," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Obviously, he went on, "the real motive of the US side is to
interfere in China's internal affairs on the pretext of caring
about China's human rights."
</P>
<P>
"We hereby express our firm opposition to the US act of
seriously violating the basic norms of the international
relations," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the US government should respect the facts,
abide by the norms of the international laws, and stop using the
the so-called human rights issue to meddle in other countries'
internal affairs.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Bans Unapproved Trips Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
banned foreign trips by public officers without clearance and
approval of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
The officers are to get the clearance from the office of the
Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) through
written application which should reach the office not less than
three weeks to the departure date.
</P>
<P>
According to a circular signed by the SGF last week, public
officers must get approval from his office in spite of the source
of foreign exchange for the trip.
</P>
<P>
Such application must contain among other things "a clear
statement of the purpose of the trip, the duration and cost
implications" of the journey, the circular said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, accounting officers and internal auditors have been
cautioned to ensure compliance with the provisions of the
circular.
</P>
<P>
According to SGF Alhaji Gidado Idris, the government viewed
with serious concern the way and manner ministers and public
servants travel out on frivolous assignments.
</P>
<P>
In the circular, the SGF warned ministers to curb their
overseas travels or face the wrath of government, but he did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The allowances given to public officers for their travel
outside the country have been under tense criticism.
</P>
<P>
National Economic Intelligence Committee Chairman Sam Aluko
once disclosed that the officers are paid 360 U.S. Dollars a
night for their stay in foreign countries, which puts Nigeria
next only to the former Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Even the United Nations and the most developed countries do
not pay that much at public expense, according to him.

<HEADLINE> China's Non-State Economy Absorbing Surplus Laborers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- China's State Administration
for Industry and Commerce said that its non-state economy has
become an important source of job opportunities for unemployed
state-company workers.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 900,000 workers laid off by state-owned
enterprises found employment with private businesses last year,
and over 1.9 million more jobless workers became self-employed.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, about 55 million Chinese in urban and rural areas were
employed in small businesses, with a total registered capital of
250 billion yuan (30 billion US dollars). The number of private
enterprises increased to 800,000, with more than six million
employees.
</P>
<P>
The non-state economy has become a leading force in the
country's economy, helping maintain a stable social order, sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The non-state sector is expected to be able to develop at a
higher rate than the state economy during the 1996-2000 period,
although the state-owned enterprises play a dominant role in
China's economy.

<HEADLINE> Croatian Priest Murdered in Rwandan Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 1 (Xinhua) -- A Roman Catholic priest from
Croatia, father Vjeko Curic, was assassinated in Kigali Saturday
night, the office of Rwandan Capital's police has said.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian priest who was in his forties has been living in
Rwanda for over 17 years, a release of Rwanda News Agency sent
specially for Xinhua said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He was vicar of Kivumu Parish, of Kabgayi Diocese in Central
Gitarama Province of Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Sources from Kabgayi have indicated that he was very much
involved in the reconstruction of his Diocese of which he was the
treasurer.
</P>
<P>
Much of the work related to the construction of houses for the
genocide survivors and the returnee in collaboration with the
Catholic non-governmental organizations (NGOs).
</P>
<P>
He reportedly saved many lives during the 1994 genocide which
claimed about one million Tutsis and Hutus lives from the
opposition who had sought refuge at Kabgayi.
</P>
<P>
"We have no clue about the identity of the murderer," the
Kigali Police told Rwanda News Agency, adding that investigations
have already started.
</P>
<P>
It is further reported that father Curic was shot dead by a
man who was travelling with him in his vehicle near Sainte
Famille Church, located near the main city round-about.
</P>
<P>
Security forces which rushed to the site of the crime found
eight pistol bullets in the father's body.
</P>
<P>
The murder of father Curic follows that of other clergy
people: a Belgian nun, a Canadian priest, and three sisters from
the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
Although no one has been so far arrested in connection with
the murder, well-informed sources in Gitarama have indicated that
father Curic had been receiving many death threats before.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, he miraculously escaped from an assassination attempt
at his residence in Kivumu.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the local army commander had provided him with an
armed guard that was watching over his home at night.

<HEADLINE> Northwest China's Shaanxi Using More Direct Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Shaanxi
Province approved the establishment of 182 direct foreign
investment (DFI) projects in 1997.
</P>
<P>
These projects involved a contractual use of 644 million
U.S. dollars of overseas investment. The province's paid-in sum of
overseas investment for 1997 was 628 million U.S. dollars,
according to an official with the provincial bureau for foreign
trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the number of approved DFI projects and
contractual use of overseas investment decreased last year
compared with 1996, but the paid-in volume of foreign investment
increased by 97 percent.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi is a major scientific and technological research
center, ranking third in the country for its comprehensive
scientific and technological strength.
</P>
<P>
The province has introduced a wide range of measures and
strategies to turn scientific, technological and resource
advantages into economic advantages. It has organized many large
trade and economic activities to publicize the province.
</P>
<P>
It has also attached great importance to the use of overseas
funds and relied on market forces in the use of foreign funds
instead of its past practice of drawing foreign investment only by
offering preferential treatment.
</P>
<P>
So far, companies from more than 50 countries and regions,
including Coca Cola of the United States, Rolls Royce of Great
Britain and Siemens of Germany, have invested in the province.
</P>
<P>
The province has approved 2,500 foreign-invested projects which
involve contractual use of more than 4 billion U.S. dollars of
overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
The actual paid-in sum of overseas investment on these projects
stands at 1.6 billion U.S. dollars, placing the province far ahead
of the neighboring Xinjiang Uygur and Ningxia Hui autonomous
regions as well as Qinghai, Gansu and Shaanxi provinces.

<HEADLINE> Two New Parties Launched for Cambodia's July Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Two new political parties
were launched simultaneously here Sunday to head into Cambodia's
national elections scheduled for July 26.
</P>
<P>
One of the two parties, named the Reastr Niyum Party, or the
Populationalist Party, was led by First Prime Minister and Foreign
Minister Ung Huot.
</P>
<P>
The other was the Sangkum Thmei Party, or the New Society
Party, headed by First Vice Chairman of the National Assembly, or
parliament, Loy Sim Chheang.
</P>
<P>
Their members are from the royalist FUNCINPEC party, which has
been weakened after its leader, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, was
ousted from power in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh, son of King Norodom Sihanouk, led the FUNCINPEC to
gain a majority of parliamentary seats in the 1993 national
elections sponsored by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The FUNCINPEC won 58 seats out of a total of 120 in the top
legislature in the 1993 race, while its rival, the Cambodian
People's Party led by Hun Sen, gained 52 seats.
</P>
<P>
Ung Huot was elected last August as First Prime Minister to
replace Prince Ranariddh, who has been in exile ever since.
</P>
<P>
Five FUNCINPEC assembly members, including Industry Minister
Pou Sothir and Agriculture Minister Tao Seng Huor, have optioned
to join the Reastr Niyum Party of Ung Huot.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Sangkum Thmei Party of Loy Sim Chheang has
recruited five other former FUNCINPEC assembly members.
</P>
<P>
A political analyst here said the formation of the two parties
could be a sign that Prince Ranariddh was losing support from his
party members.
</P>
<P>
The two new parties' leaders were former FUNCINPEC standing
committee members, but were expelled after Prince Ranariddh
declared that they had colluded with Hun Sen's government.
</P>
<P>
Kann Man, a parliamentarian still loyal to Ranariddh, told
Xinhua that the formation of the new parties are only the options
to restore the reputations of their leaders ousted by the
FUNCINPEC.
</P>
<P>
Kann Man added that the two leaders, who used to have dignity
as high officials, wanted to keep up their own choice for stepping
forward in their political lives.
</P>
<P>
About Ung Huot and Loy Sim Chheang's move, Ky Lam Ang, another
FUNCINPEC parliamentarian, said they have rights to form new
parties, so as to avoid being blocked from political activities.
</P>
<P>
Even though some split inside the FUNCINPEC party does exist,
Ky Lam Ang said, the structure of the party is still firm and it
still gains support from the majority of the people.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony for launching his own party, Loy Sim Chheang
argued: "I do not quit from the FUNCINPEC but the leader expelled
me from the party, so I have to go and find a new roof."
</P>
<P>
So far, 41 political parties have been formed to contest in the
coming elections. In comparison, 20 parties were there in the 1993
elections.

<HEADLINE> System of Administering Water Resources Established </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, Feburary 1 (Xinhua) -- China has established a system
of administering water resources, according to reports at a recent
conference on water resources, in Suzhou, in east China's Jiangsu
Province.
</P>
<P>
A series of water resource laws and policies have provided
China with 80,000 people in supervisory positions.
</P>
<P>
The rule of law is the basic principle of the Chinese central
government, and senior Water Resource Ministry officials believe
that a fairly complete legal system on water resources will meet
the needs of the socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
The People's Congress, China's lawmaking body, has passed 70
laws and regulations, and provincial legislatures have approved
some 700 laws, policies and regulations on water resources.
</P>
<P>
In Jiangsu Province, provincial water administration workers
tore down 400 illegal buildings harming water resources protection
in 1997 in related work, and Guangdong Province and the Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region have gotten rid of 15,000 sq.m. and
23,000 sq.m. of illegal buildings respectively.
</P>
<P>
Water resource bureaus at all levels have launched a series of
publicity campaigns to enhance public awareness and the idea of
water resources in China to pave the way for a legal system
covering water resources.

Venables may stay in Australia to help the national prepare for
the 2000 Olympic Games tournament, reports said in Sydney on

</P>
<P>
Venables, who is contracted to coach the national side until

Soccer Australia chairman David Hill said Sunday that he had
hoped by now to put a detailed proposal to Venables to stay as
national coach to the 2002 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
The Briton's future has been in doubt after Australia failed
narrowly to make the World Cup finals. Since then he has been

Everton and Glasgow giant Rangers.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 1 (Xinhua) -- India's annual rate of
inflation moved up to 5.78 percent for the week that ended on
January 17, as prices of pulses and vegetables continued to
skyrocket, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The inflation, based on the wholesale price index (WPI) rose by
0.05 percentage points to 5.78 percent (provisional), the highest
in last six months.
</P>
<P>
The upsurge in inflation in recent weeks has been caused mainly
by the unusual behavior of the southwest Monsoon and the severe
cold conditions sweeping the north. As a result, in the last five
weeks alone, the prices of pulses and vegetables have gone up by a
massive 14.57 percent and 16.62 percent respectively.

<HEADLINE> China's Grand Canal Beginning to Attract Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu province
plans to turn the old Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal into a new
tourism site and is preparing a number of activities for tourists
to get in contact with Chinese farmers and enjoy sightseeing on
the canal.
</P>
<P>
To improve services, the local government will build pleasure
boats and train guides and will clear some of the trash along the
canal and plant trees.
</P>
<P>
The Grand Canal, a waterway more than 1,000 miles in length
built in Sui Dynasty (581-618 AD), was one of the two greatest
projects in Chinese history, along with the Great Wall. Now, a
millenium after it was built, the canal is still carrying boats,
but because of silting and pollution, it has lost much of its
former beauty and prominence.
</P>
<P>
The Jiangsu section of the canal passes by economically-booming
cities of Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, and Zhenjiang, and connects
with the Yangtze River, Taihu Lake system, and reaches Hangzhou
and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, the province has made an effort to
dredge the section to improve navigation and the canal can handle
500-tonnage boats now.

<HEADLINE> Southeast Asian Tourists Flocking to South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Some 120,000 from Southeast Asian
countries flocked to South Korea for skiing in the past 40 days,
up 50 percent from the same period last year, said the Korea
National Tourism Organization Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The number of tourists from the Southeast Asian region,
including from Hong Kong, Taiwan, is increasingly swelling, said
the organization.
</P>
<P>
The state-run tourism body attributed the increasing number to
South Korean won's sharp devaluation against the U.S. dollar,
which has made the nation a competitive tourist spot although the
winter started three weeks later than usual.
</P>
<P>
Since late 1997, South Korea has remained in a serious
financial crisis triggered by the failures of a slew of
conglomerates and bad loans of financial institutions, which has
sent the won plunge sharply against the U.S. dollar to new low.
</P>
<P>
Before the crisis, the Greenback equalled some 835 won, but it
has soared to 1,565 against the South Korean currency.

<HEADLINE> Changes in Livestock Feed Needed to Ease Grain Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, February 1 (Xinhua) -- An agricultural expert is
calling for changes in animal husbandry which separate food grain
from forage crops.
</P>
<P>
"China's tension over grain shortages will never ease with the
tradition of humans and livestock sharing grain," said Jiang
Yuming, a research fellow from China Rice Research Institute in
Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Jiang is now focusing on the subject of "how to feed more
people with limited land."
</P>
<P>
He also suggested harvesting forage crops at the end of their
mid-growth period, rather than waiting for crops to mature.
</P>
<P>
Forage crops harvested during this period maintain more
nutrients compared with crops harvested during other periods, he
said.
</P>
<P>
This practice also helps increase the multiple crops index and
makes full use of sunlight and land resources.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the country still follows the old tradition of
feeding livestock with food crops.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the China Forage Office show that 30 percent of
China's grain output, goes to feed livestock every year.
</P>
<P>
With an ever-increasing population and decreasing farmland,
China will begin to face grain shortages in coming years, Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
The improving living standard makes it more difficult, he said,
as China is consuming more and more meat.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, China will produce 170 million tons of forage crops
annually, accounting for 33 percent of the total grain output.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 1 (Xinhua) -- More than 300 Tamil rebels and
at least 20 army soldiers were killed in a fierce fighting in
Northern Sri Lanka early Sunday, a military spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Ink Dewage said a large number of Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels launched an attack on troops
stationed in Kilinochchi District in the north at 1:30 am (local
time).
</P>
<P>
Backed by artillery and aircraft, the troops repulsed the
rebels, the spokesman said. The fighting lasted till daybreak.
</P>
<P>
Latest military reports said that over 300 rebels were killed
and a large number of others wounded during the fighting.
</P>
<P>
At least 20 soldiers were killed and 86 others injured, Dewage
said. Observers here estimated that the army's casualties could be
higher.
</P>
<P>
Government troops were now in complete control of the area and
a search operation was in progress, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The latest fighting, the biggest in recent months in Sri Lanka,
took place one week after LTTE rebels mounted a bomb attack in the
central ancient city of Kandy in a bid to mar the 50th
independence day celebrations.
</P>
<P>
One day after the bombing, the Sri Lankan government announced
it outlawed the LTTE with immediate effect. The LTTE has been
fighting for an independent state of their own in the north and
east for more than 14 years.

<HEADLINE> China Provides Better Legal System, Investment Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, SWITZERLAND, January 31 (Xinhua) -- China's improved
legal system and investment environment have brought good returns
to both foreign investors and China itself, Chinese Vice Premier
Li Lanqing said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, China has, for the past 20 years or so, absorbed
a total of 220 billion U.S. dollars of direct foreign investment,"
Li told a panel session on China Economy of the ongoing annual
meeting of the World Economic Forum.
</P>
<P>
China has become the world's second largest recipient of direct
foreign investment, next only to the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Opening up is our long-term state policy," Li said. "We are
going to apply more favorable policies from January 1 this year
for equipment import to China by foreign investors. We welcome
more foreign investment in China."
</P>
<P>
With sustained development of industry and service sectors,
China's economy has turned "from a shortage economy to a buyer's
market" with a good supply of goods, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He also talked about the difficulties and challenges China is
facing, such as further economic restructuring and enterprise
reform.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that there exist problems during the transition
from the traditional planned economy to a socialist market one.
</P>
<P>
"However, we have gained rich experience through years of
reform," Li said. "We are confident that this difficult goal will
be reached by deepening the reform."

<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, SWITZERLAND, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong has
enjoyed a high degree of autonomy as a special administrative
region of China, Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The autonomy is mandated by the policies of "one country, two
systems" and "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" in practice
since the region's return to China last July, Li noted here.
</P>
<P>
"Thanks to the effective leadership and management of the
present Hong Kong government, Hong Kong has enjoyed social
stability with ever growing public confidence," he told a panel
session of the annual World Economic Forum meeting.
</P>
<P>
On the Asian financial crisis's impact, Li said Hong Kong will
be able to keep the adverse effects to the minimum, given its
sound economic fundamentals, tight financial supervision and
regulation, abundant foreign exchange reserves and prompt and
proper measures by the Hong Kong government.
</P>
<P>
"Facts have proven that as long as China maintains a steady
economic growth, Hong Kong will be able to maintain its prosperity
and stability," the vice premier said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government is fully supportive of the work and
measures of the present Hong Kong government to maintain Hong
Kong's financial stability and the Hong Kong dollar pegged to the
U.S. dollar," Li said. "We are confident of Hong Kong's future."

<HEADLINE> Neighborhood Committees in China's Urban Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Neighborhood committees in
China's urban areas, or "State Councils" as local residents often
call them, are in contact with as many as 700 households and get
their nickname from their close relations with local residents.
</P>
<P>
China's first neighborhood committee was set up in Shanghai's
Huangpu District in December of 1949, the year new China was
founded, and now there are more than 113,600 of them in urban
areas. The Chinese capital alone had at least 5,000.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Guixing, head of a grassroots political power section at
the Beijing Civil Affairs Bureau, said: neighborhood committees
are non-government organizations that play an important role in
maintaining social order and promoting socialist cultural and
ethical progress that can't be done by other government offices.
</P>
<P>
A neighborhood committee consists of six committees in charge
of social order, mediating disputes, social welfare, public
sanitation, family planning, and education.
</P>
<P>
Other tasks include publicizing celebrations of important
events, providing daily help for local residents, or mobilizing
people to kill mice, cockroaches, or mosquitos, according to Wang
Shiliang, director of the Qinan neighborhood committee in
Beijing's Western District.
</P>
<P>
There are a total of some 400,000 people working at
neighborhood committees in China's urban areas.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, there are 22,000 people working in local
neighborhood committees, whose heads include retired workers,
laid-off workers, intellectuals, and cadres at various levels,
1,900 of whom have diplomas or are polytechnic school grads.

<HEADLINE> Li Lanqing: China Should Join WTO at Earliest Possible Date </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, SWITZERLAND, January 31 (Xinhua) -- China's Vice Premier
Li Lanqing on Saturday expressed his hope that China will join the
World Trade Organization (WTO) at an earliest possible date.
</P>
<P>
"Now that major progress has been made in recent negotiations,
we hope the issue will be solved as soon as possible," Li told a
panel session on China Economy of the World Economic Forum meeting.
</P>
<P>
Regarding its entry into the WTO, Li said China has been
working in this direction over the past 11 years, has lowered its
tariff level five times since 1992 and will continue to do so.
</P>
<P>
China took part in the entire process of the Uruguay Round of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations and
signed the final package agreements with the WTO's predecessor.
</P>
<P>
"The principle for China's entry into the WTO is that China is
ready to undertake the obligations for a developing country and
should at the same time enjoy its due rights," Li stated.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice premier said he believes the notion that China
needs the WTO and vice versa, adding: "Without China's membership,
the WTO can hardly play a bigger role."

<HEADLINE> Arafat-Clinton Letter on Covenant Changes Ratified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Council
(PNC) has ratified the letter, which Palestinian National
Authority President Yasser Arafat gave to U.S. President Bill
Clinton last month detailing the changes in the Palestinian
Covenant.
</P>
<P>
Arafat convened the 18-member executive committee of the PNC in
the West Bank city of Ramallah Saturday night to discuss the
changed clauses in the covenant calling for Israel's
destruction, Israel Radio reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will consider publishing the amended version of the
covenant after the executive committee ratified the letter,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's communication
adviser David Bar-Illan said that convening the executive
committee is not enough, noting that "canceling the clauses must
be done by the PNC by a two-thirds majority."
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Clinton last month in Washington,
Netanyahu also insisted that the Palestinian Covenant, written
three decades ago, still contains clauses that call for the
destruction of Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians contend that those clauses were effectively
nullified by an extraordinary session of the PNC in 1996. But
Israel said the Palestinians had never formally followed up the
pledge to remove the clauses.
</P>
<P>
The Americans have indicated the U.S. administration recognizes
Arafat's letter to Clinton as a fulfillment of the Palestinian
commitment on that issue. And they accept that the drafting of a
new covenant will have to wait for a final settlement.
</P>
<P>
The ratification of the letter came on the eve of the scheduled
meeting on Sunday between Arafat and U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, who arrived here Saturday night on a visit to
the Middle East region.

</P>
<P>
"Through years of reform, we have found an operation model for
our macro economy .. with high growth and low inflation," he said.

Li told his audience that China, though till now has not been
directly affected, has prepared itself for the possible impact and
worked out counter measures in face of financial crisis.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Following the talks between
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the U  Albright, who arrived here from London Satu
rday night, headed
immediately into talks with Netanyahu on the Iraqi crisis and the
deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. The talks were
extended and lasted for five hours till early Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
Due to the extended talks, Albright canceled a scheduled news
conference Saturday night in the Laromme Hotel and she sent her
spokesman James Rubin to read a statement to the waiting
journalists.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said Albright and Netanyahu first dealt with the Iraqi
crisis at the start of their meeting. Albright briefed Netanyahu
about the U.S. plan on handling of the crisis and both leaders
agreed to continue to coordinate closely over the crisis as the
two countries did during the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
But Rubin refused to answer the question if the U.S. accepts
the sovereign right of Israel to retaliate any attack launched by
Iraq. During the Gulf War, Israel was pressured by Washington to
refrain from retaliating the missile attacks by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the two spent most of the time on the issues
concerning the Israeli-Palestinian deadlock, although he cautioned
against an expectation for a quick breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
"Not surprisingly, she (Albright) spent the bulk of the time on
how to break the stalemate between Israelis and Palestinians in
the Middle East peace process. She discussed the ideas that the
president (Bill Clinton) presented to the prime minister
(Netanyahu) and Chairman (Yasser) Arafat and the initial reactions
that both leaders have had to these ideas," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Albright also put forward some new ideas based
on those presented by Clinton during his separate talks with
Netanyahu and Arafat late last month in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Albright was refining the Clinton ideas "on a parallel and
step-by-step process where the two sides take spontaneous steps,"
the Palestinians on fighting terror and the Israelis on carrying
out the delayed redeployment in the West Bank, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. and Israel are dealing intensively with the
"quality, quantity and timing of the further redeployment," as
Washington is still pressing Israel to suspend its settlement
activities.
</P>
<P>
Albright is to continue talks with Israeli President Ezer
Weizman and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai Sunday morning
before travelling to the West Bank city of Ramallah to meet with
Arafat.

the city where new medical equipment was commissioned.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the country, said the minister, only 4 percent of
residents have their latrines.
</P>
<P>
Cholera was long overdue under such circumstances, he said,
referring to the recent outbreak of the epidemic from last
November to earlier January this year which killed at least 340
Ugandans.
</P>
<P>
Records in 1996 in his ministry said 50 percent of patients
contracted diseases related to poor sanitation, Kiyonga noted.
</P>
<P>
The government has so far spent 27 billions of Uganda
Shillings or 27 millions of U.S. Dollars in the fight against
poor sanitation related diseases, he told the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged health workers to launch an education
program to remind local people to improve their health and
hygienic conditions. It is a pity that 27 billions of Shillings
(some 27 million U.S. Dollars) have been used in fighting
preventive diseases, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
State-owned Mulago hospital has most sophisticated equipment
in the country. The new equipment commissioned includes a central
oxygen/vacuum supply room, a radiotherapy gamma camera room, an
intensive care unit, a radio-pharmacy laboratory and a
computerized tomographic scan.
</P>
<P>
These apparatus were funded by the Ugandan government and the
International Atomic Energy, ''the Monitor'' paper said in a
latest report.
</P>
<P>
Insufficient infrastructure is the problem bothering local
residents and Kampala city council. Infrastructure system in the
city was founded in 1950s when the city had 30,000 people.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho PM Asks to Resign from Ruling Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho Prime Minister
Ntsu Mokhehle has asked to be relieved of the ruling Lesotho
Congress for Democracy (LCD)'s leadership.
</P>
<P>
Addressing delegates Saturday at the party's first annual
general meeting since its formation last June, Mokhehle, 79, said
he believed it was time to hand the party's reigns to young
leaders.
</P>
<P>
Local daily Sunday Times quoted the ailing Mokhehle as saying
that he was "tired through illness and old age".
</P>
<P>
Mokhehle said in a messagee read on his behalf by Deputy Prime
Minister Pakalitha Mosisili that he had been instructed by his
doctors to rest for a few days before resuming work.
</P>
<P>
He reportedly received medical treatment at a hospital in
Bloemfontein, South Africa, last week.
</P>
<P>
The LCD's delegates are discussing preparations for the
mountain kingdom's upcoming general election, scheduled for late
April and early May, and the local government elections later.
</P>
<P>
Mokhehle had earlier announced that he did not intend
contesting the premiership in the general election.
</P>
<P>
"Even if I can continue working with the LCD leadership the
party should allocate me any other duties, aware that my time to
go has arrived," he said.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Urged to Work Together at Constitutional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Australian Republican Movement
(ARM) chairman Malcolm Turnbull Sunday warned his republican
colleagues to work together to prevent this week's constitutional
convention being used to frustrate progress towards a republic.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters ahead of the start of the convention
Monday, Turnbull also said a deadline for Australia becoming a
republic by the start of the Sydney 2000 Olympics was achievable.
</P>
<P>
"We feel we are getting very close to the time when a
referendum will be put to the Australian people," he said. "It
looks as though that is going to be able to be done, as long as
people working in this convention do so with goodwill."
</P>
<P>
"I said to our colleagues this morning that this convention
cannot create a republic. We can do no more than make a
recommendation to the government and to parliament for a
constitution amendment bill," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "The one thing this convention can do is
delay and frustrate the move to a republic, because if the
delegates ... fail to work in an open-minded constructive fashion
and fail to do the job the Australian people have asked them to
do, then the move to a republic will be delayed."
</P>
<P>
Turnbull said he was hopeful a consensus would be reached at
the conclusion of the two-week convention.
</P>
<P>
"I am highly confident of a consensus being achieved," he said,
adding that under the circumstances, a consensus need only be a
majority of delegates.
</P>
<P>
Turnbull said the ARM continued to oppose a popularly-elected
head of state, preferring a vote by two-thirds majority of
parliament.
</P>
<P>
"That would ensure the president had the support of both sides
of politics," he said.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Emergency Law to Affect Aid Inflow: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Zambia Association of
Chambers of Commerce and Industry (ZACCI) has said the extension
of the state of emergency will not help the country get the 35
percent of the budget expenditure to be financed by donors.
</P>
<P>
Sunday times paper Sunday quoted ZACCI Chairman George
Chabwera as saying at a budget analysis meeting here Saturday
that the extension of the state of emergency law imposed one day
after the October 28 abortive coup is regrettable as it allegedly
leaves little confidence on the business community.
</P>
<P>
He said since the government expects 35 percent of the 1998
budget to be sourced from the donors, the extension does not give
confidence that the money will be obtained.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper quoted Chabwera as further saying that in
1997 Zambia was supposed to get about 210 million U.S. Dollars
from the donors but only about 100 million Dollars was secured.
</P>
<P>
But Finance Minister Ronald Penza defended the extension,
saying that it is necessary to ensure the perpetrators of the
coup attempt are brought to book in time.
</P>
<P>
The issue of good governance is very difficult as this is not
defined and Zambia's cooperating partners can ask for certain
benchmarks but when these are met they raise other issues
relating to the good governance, said Penza, who presented the
1998 budget report last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Zambian parliament passed a government motion last Thursday to
extend the state of emergency law for another three months.
</P>
<P>
A total of 95 people have been arrested since the coup
including former president Kenneth Kaunda. Following
international appeals for Kaunda's immediate release or a charge
against him the government transferred Kaunda to under house
arrest on December 31 of 1997 six days after his arrest in
alleged involvement in the coup.

<HEADLINE> Korda Wins Australian Open Final (reopen) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The year 1998 is the best year
for Czech tennis star Petr Korda as his dream of becoming a grand
slam champion came true in Melbourne on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
At the age of 30, he scored an one-sided victory on Sunday over
his opponent in the Australian Open's Final.
</P>
<P>
Sixth-seeded Korda easily beat the error-prone ninth seed
Marcelo Rios of Chile Sunday in straight sets 6-2, 6-2, 6-2 in 82
minutes in the men's final.
</P>
<P>
"I've been waiting for this moment for a long time, it's really
my dream come true," Korda told reporters shortly after the match.
</P>
<P>
After hitting the winning forehand cross-court return past
Rios, Korda sank to his knees and held his head in both hands for
some time.
</P>
<P>
He than hurled his racquet high into the crowd before
scrambling up into the stands to embrace his wife, Regina.
</P>
<P>
Then came his trademark scissors kick after which he pulled his
shirt off and tossed that to the crowd, too.
</P>
<P>
Korda has been popular to spectators and cameramen as he often
do something entertaining on the spot to celebrate his victories.
</P>
<P>
He turned cartwheels on the court after he defeated Karol
Kucera in semi-finals and did scissor jumps in previous victories.
</P>
<P>
With a long-neck and short-cut hair, The skinny and long-limbed
Korda was described in Australia as a human toothbrush.
</P>
<P>
Korda's win was the most one-sided men's Australian final since
Ivan Lendl beat fellow Czech Miloslav Mecir by the same scoreline
in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Korda has now vaulted him to number two in the world,
supplanting Australia's Patrick Rafter while Rios has risen to
number five.
</P>
<P>
In his only other grand slam final, Korda lost to American Jim
Courier in the 1992 French Open in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Korda on Sunday earned 405,000 US dollars and Rios took home
202,900 US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Korda had an outstanding 1997, winning in Stuttgart and beating
world number one Pete Sampras of the United States in the fourth
round at the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
He is undefeated this year, winning in Qatar a fortnight ago,
and lifting his ranking into the top 10 for the first time in six
years.
</P>
<P>
For most of his career, Korda has languished in mediocrity. In
35 Grand Slam appearances, the left-hander had failed at the first
hurdle 12 times. On the big occasions the Czech used to falter.
</P>
<P>
This is Rios' first Grand Slam final and his third appearance
in the Australian Open. He lost in the first round in 1996 and in
the quarter-finals last year.
</P>
<P>
Rios, 22, said he was disappointed with the loss but had had "a
great week."

<P>
-- The "millennium bug" computer problem began to bite in

The Sunday Independent
</P>
<P>
-- As South African and European Union negotiators worked on
the details of a historic free-trade agreement in Pretoria this
week, signs of growing disquiet over the deal have been emerging
from other countries on the subcontinent. Botswana, Lesotho,
Namibia and Swaziland demanded an impact assessment as they
feared that they will lose fiscal income because of diminishing
tariffs and that their unemployment will rise.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Confidence-Building and Trend of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- After being hit by fresh
financial storms in early January, currency and stock markets in
Thailand, the Philippines and South Korea made a steady recovery
in the past few trading days.
</P>
<P>
With the encouraging development in the markets, some people
predict that the East Asia's financial crisis has entered its
final stage and could be over soon, while some argue that it will
persist for some time and the worst has yet to come.
</P>
<P>
Which is correct? Most analysts say it is still too early to
judge the trend of the crisis, which started last July.
</P>
<P>
However, as the crisis has entered its eighth month now,
international speculative activities are no longer the main threat
to market stabilization. Structure problems in some East Asian
economies, the major cause of the crisis, are unlikely to trigger
a new round of financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
To a great extent, analysts say, the trend of the
seven-month-old crisis would be determined by people's confidence
in economies of the region.
</P>
<P>
But, to regain investors' confidence is, among other
confidence-building factors, the most important for a brisk market
recovery in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
Since the Thai financial turmoil burst onto the scene seven
months ago, currencies of Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia,
Malaysia and South Korea have lost half of their value against the
greenback, and stock values in these countries have also declined
by 60 to 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
The crisis slowed the growth pace of the East Asian economy
with some countries' growth rates falling by 2 to 6 percent in
1997, and the slowdown will continue this year.
</P>
<P>
The economic slowdown will affect the return of investment
profits, but what could effectively frighten away investors now
are bad loans and huge foreign debts in East Asian nations. In
Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and South Korea,
bad loans are estimated at over 10 percent of the total bank
loans. South Korea's foreign debts have amounted to 150 billion
dollars, Indonesia 130 billion dollars and Thailand 100 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The bad loans will force more bank closures in the near future
and reschedules of debt repayment will threaten the survival of
some foreign creditors, especially Japanese banks, whose loans
account for 60 percent of the total received by East Asia nations.
</P>
<P>
Together with financial risks are potential political risks and
social instability in the region. Indonesia's presidential
election is scheduled for next month, and the Philippines' is set
for May. The change of guards in the two countries is creating
uncertainty about their political and economic future, which has
also made investors nervous.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, economic reforms under IMF programs are affecting
living standards of people, and creating more social problems.
After the IMF offered 117 billion dollars of loans to South Korea,
Indonesia and Thailand, the three countries are undertaking
economic reforms characterized by high interest rates, social
welfare cuts, financial austerity and layoffs. The belt-tightening
programs have already met the opposition of people with protests
and riots in these countries.
</P>
<P>
Coupled with financial risks and potential social instability
in the region, investors are expected to take some time to place
their confidence in the region, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Market stabilization also depends on East Asian nations'
confidence in their own economies. So far, governments in the
region have shown their determination to overcome the crisis by
cutting this year's budgets, including salaries of senior
officials. In South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand and the
Philippines, people donated their jewelry and changed dollars into
local currencies to help stabilize markets. All these actions
reflected people's confidence in their own economies and could
help make an early market recovery.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the trend of the crisis is also determined by
confidence of local companies in the economy. The speculative
activities by local companies was largely blamed for the market
turmoil early last month.
</P>
<P>
Because of lacking confidence in their own economies, local
companies last month hedged dollars to prepare debt repayment for
fear of further devaluation of local currencies. The speculation
rocked the markets, triggering a new round of financial turmoil in
the region.
</P>
<P>
At present, East Asian nations are trying one way and another
to readjust their economies, and the United States and other West
countries, for their own economic interests, are starting to join
rescue operations in the region. The joint operations are
strengthening people's confidence in the East Asian economy.
</P>
<P>
However, to regain confidence would take some time. During the
course of confidence-building, ups and downs in the financial
market are still unavoidable, and the end of the crisis would take
a longer time.

<HEADLINE> EU Concerned Over Zambia's Extension of State of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
expressed deep concern over Zambia's extension of the state of
emergency for another three months and urged the government to
complete investigations and charge or release all detainees.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released Saturday in Lusaka, the EU urged the
Zambian government to investigate the allegations of torture made
by some of the detainees picked up in connection with last year's
abortive October 28 coup, according to Sunday Times of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
"The European Union now strongly urges the government of
Zambia to complete their investigations with all possible speed,
to charge or release all the detainees and to end the state of
emergency at the earliest opportunity," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
On the extension of the state of emergency by parliament last
week for another three months, the EU pointed out that it had
hoped the probe into the coup would be completed within the
initial 90 days period of the state of emergency as the extension
would entail continued suspension of basic human rights.
</P>
<P>
However, the state-owned English paper quoted Homes Affairs
Minister Peter Machungwa who defended the parliament's decision
of the extension as saying Saturday that the Zambian government
is responsible for the security of its people and therefore wants
to do a "thorough and professional" job.
</P>
<P>
He added that it is not the wish of the government to delay
the investigation but the limited available resources and the
complexity of the case has caused the extension.
</P>
<P>
The state of emergency was declared by President Frederick
Chiluba last October to facilitate the investigations into the
failed coup but it is required to review and ratify by parliament
every three months.
</P>
<P>
Under the state of emergency, more than 90 people including
former president and opposition leader Kenneth Kaunda have been
detained and no one has been tried until now.

first division match between Portsmouth and Sheffield United on
Saturday, according to reports reaching here.

Edward Martin, who was described later as "comfortable", had
stayed overnight in the hospital but was expected to be allowed
home on Sunday.

The incident started just before halftime when Sheffield United
goalkeeper Simon Tracey handled outside his box.

The referee first appeared set to merely book Tracey but after
linesman Martin intervened he sent Tracey off.

The infuriated fan, believed to be a Sheffield United
supporter, then jumped out of the crowd and assaulted Martin.

The linesman lay unconscious for about five minutes before
coming round but appeared to slip into unconsciousness for a

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Life expectancy for people in
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is now up to 63
years, today's "People's Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
This means a real forward step from the figure of only 30 years
in the early years after liberation, the newspaper quoted sources
from the regional health bureau as saying.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang now has more than 100,000 people working in the field
of medicine, including over 10,000 doctors and health care workers
working in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
With better medical equipment and more health care workers,
Xinjiang has effectively halted the spread of various kinds of
infectious diseases like plague, cholera, and hepatitis.

TOKYO, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Star class yacht racing and
women's pentathlon will be included in the 2000 Olympic Games in
Sydney, Australia, the International Olympic Committee officials
said in Nagano, Japan, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
But the Sydney Olympics organizers said in order to maintain
the limitation on the number of the overall competitors, entries
for some other events have to be cut.
</P>
<P>
The normal 32-strong entry for men's modern pentathlon has been
halved and the same number will contest the women's event, while
reductions would have to be made to other yachting categories to
keep the number of sailors to a limit of around 400.

<HEADLINE> Korda Wins Australian Open Men's Singles Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The year 1998 is the best year
for 30 year-old Petr Korda as his dream came true Sunday following
his one-sided victory over his opponent in the Australian Open
final.
</P>
<P>
Sixth seed Korda of Czech Republic easily beat ninth seed
Marcelo Rios of Chile in the men's singles final in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
Korda, 30, defeated Rios, 22, in straight sets 6-2, 6-2, 6-2 in
82 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The victory was Korda's second Grand Slam final, having lost to
Jim Courier in Paris in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Korda had an outstanding 1997, winning in Stuttgart and beating
world number one Pete Sampras in the fourth round at the
U. S. Open.
</P>
<P>
He is undefeated this year, winning in Qatar a fortnight ago,
and lifting his ranking into the top 10 for the first time in six
years.
</P>
<P>
For most of his career, Korda has languished in mediocrity. In
35 Grand Slam appearances, the left-hander had failed at the first
hurdle 12 times. On the big occasions the Czech used to falter.
</P>
<P>
This is Rios' first Grand Slam final and his third appearance
in the Australian Open. He lost in the first round in 1996 and in
the quarter-finals last year.
</P>
<P>
Rios had not played a seed on his way to the final.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Requests World Bank Loan for Reemployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is seeking a 300
million U.S. dollar loan from the World Bank for a program to
create jobs for upcountry workers left unemployed by the economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The request was made during talks Saturday between Thai Finance
Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda and World Bank President James
Wolfensohn, who is on a nine-day trip of six Asian countries,
according to the Bangkok Post Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn expressed his full support for the loan request for
a proposed Social Investment Program and expected the World Bank
Board to approve the scheme shortly.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The true impact of crises comes less on the people in
the financial sector, but rather on the millions of people just
near the poverty line."
</P>
<P>
The 300-million dollar Social Investment Program will help
generate jobs in existing projects such as education and tourism.
</P>
<P>
The loan, if approved, will also support rural communities,
possibly including irrigation projects or supporting development
in food processing. Grants or loans would be given to small- and
medium-sized enterprises in upcountry communities, according to
Wolfensohn.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank estimates that 800,000 Thais have already been
left unemployed by the economic crisis. About 10 percent of the
country's 60 million population lives just above the international
poverty line, with daily income of 1-1.5 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has already committed 1.5 billion dollars in
structural adjustment loans to Thailand as part of the 17.2
billion dollar package arranged by the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) approved last August.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Hopes to Open New Tourism Route to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Tourism Authority of
Thailand (TAT) is hoping to pioneer a new overland route linking
northern Thailand and southern China in order to boost Thailand's
tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
TAT Governor Seree Wangpaichitr was quoted Sunday by local
press as saying that at the moment Chinese tourists can only visit
Thailand through designated airports.
</P>
<P>
He said if the land route is opened, there will be a big influx
of Chinese coming to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
He said traveling by road is the best way to see the region.
</P>
<P>
About half a million Chinese visited Thailand in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The governor said he expected an increase of 15 percent this
year, due mainly to the sharp appreciation of the Chinese currency
yuan against Thailand's beleaguered baht, which has lost more than
half its value in the past seven months.

<HEADLINE> Thai Education Ministry Moves to Curb School Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Believing drug abuse among
students is close to national-crisis level, Thailand's Education
Ministry is pushing for a stringent anti-drug policy in schools
nationwide, according to local press Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Education Minister Sonsak Prisnananthakul was quoted as
saying that the proposal would go before the cabinet for approval
this month.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is striving to make its "white school" policy a
national priority to be taken up by the current and future
government, Sonsak said.
</P>
<P>
One white school measure is to introduce drug testing in
schools.
</P>
<P>
"The ministry will push the policy to be adopted as a long-term
policy, not a temporary measure that fades away when the country
has a new government," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sonsak insisted that drug tests are needed to assess the extent
of the problem. "It's alarming when unfounded reports were
released that about five million Thai kids are drug addicts," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Italy Weak on Public Debt, Strong on GDP, Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Italy ranked third in gross
domestic product in 1996 among the 11 European Union countries
groomed for a place in European Monetary Union, and is weak only
in the public debt category, with a debt beyond 120 percent of its
GDP compared with the Maastricht target of 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the midst of talk around Europe on Italy's public finances
and qualifications for the EMU and the single currency, analysts
here noted that Italy, Germany and France together account for
three-quarters of the continent's wealth.
</P>
<P>
According to the figures compiled by the EU statistics office,
Eurostat, for 1996, German GDP ranked first at 1,855 billion ECU,
followed by France at 1,211 billion and Italy at 956 billion.
</P>
<P>
Out of the total GDP of 5,432 billion ECU for the 11 countries,
Germany accounted for 34.14 percent, France for 22.2 percent and
Italy for 17.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, Italy's national debt in 1996 came to 1,184 billion ECU
for 28.9 percent of its total debt, said the analysts. The French
debt weighed in at only 16.4 percent at 671.5 billion ECU, and
Spain's came to 323 billion ECU for 7.9 percent of its total.
</P>
<P>
As for balances of trade, the figures for October last year,
the latest available, show a surplus for Italy of 22.6 billion
ECU, more than triple Germany's surplus of 6.6 billion and
eightfold France's 2.78 billion.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The new Bosnian Serb
government headed by Milorad Dodik was sworn in on Saturday at a
ceremony held at a parliament session in the western town of Banja
Luka.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to parliament after the inaugural ceremony, Prime
Minister Dodik said his government will work hard for the
prosperity of the republic with the support of all the people and
parties in the republic and the support from international
communities.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Serb president Biljana Plavsic and Hanns Schumacher,
deputy to Bosnia's top international official, were present
during the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The new government, which was nominated by president Plavsic
and has pledged to implement the 1995 Dayton peace accords, was
appointed on January 18 by the Bosnian Serb parliament after a
walk-out by ultra-nationalist members of parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav News Agency reported the ultranationalist deputies
of the Serb Democratic party left the session before the ceremony
began.
</P>
<P>
Also on Saturday the Bosnia Serb parliament adopted a
government proposal to move the seat of government from the
hardliners' stronghold in Pale to Banja Luka.
</P>
<P>
It also cancelled 33 laws, concerning defense, the army and the
interior ministry, that were promulgated by the former
legislature, which had continued to meet despite its dissolution
by Plavsic last July.

KUALA LUMPUR, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Eight people were burnt to
death in Malaysia when the van they were traveling in skidded and
crashed into the divider on the North-South Highway near a toll
plaza south of here early Sunday morning, according to reports

<HEADLINE> IJO Approves Scientific Jute Cultivation Work Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Dhaka-based International
Jute Organization (IJO) has approved a work plan for scientific
jute cultivation in jute-growing countries for producing quality
jute, an IJO source said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The IJO has also launched a 400,000 U.S. dollar project for
introducing the newly-evolved jute varieties and jute-related farm
technologies to the growers, the source added.
</P>
<P>
The work plan for jute promotion was approved at a two-day IJO
session on the project late last month.
</P>
<P>
The meeting decided to continue all breeding activities and
related trials initiated under the project in order to release
suitable varieties at the national level as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
In the work plan, jute experts suggested identifying the most
suitable varieties, farmers and farmer groups, technologies and
cropping patterns for adaptive research trials and demonstration.
</P>
<P>
The experts also suggested that jute-growing training be
conducted through field trials, and dissemination work of the
jute-growing knowledge should include cultivation practices,
production of quality seeds and fibers, processing and seed
storing, grading and fiber storing.
</P>
<P>
Initiated early this year and funded by the Rome-based
International Fund for Agricultural Development, the project is
scheduled for completion at the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The project, apart from boosting jute and kenaf production, is
also expected to help generate income for the farmers through
application of improved technology.
</P>
<P>
The research systems of the project-participating countries --
Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Nepal and Thailand -- will
collaborate with the IJO in implementing the project, the source
said.
</P>
<P>
The IJO was established in January 1984 with its headquarters
in Dhaka, under the integrated program for commodities for the
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.

<HEADLINE> China Provides Better Legal System, Investment Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, SWITZERLAND, January 31 (Xinhua) -- China's improved
legal system and investment environment have brought good returns
to both foreign investors and China itself, Chinese Vice Premier
Li Lanqing said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, China has, for the past 20 years or so, absorbed
a total of 220 billion U.S. dollars of direct foreign investment,"
Li told a panel session on China Economy of the ongoing annual
meeting of the World Economic Forum.
</P>
<P>
China has become the world's second largest recipient of direct
foreign investment, next only to the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Opening up is our long-term state policy," Li said. "We are
going to apply more favorable policies from January 1 this year
for equipment import to China by foreign investors. We welcome
more foreign investment in China."
</P>
<P>
With sustained development of industry and service sectors,
China's economy has turned "from a shortage economy to a buyer's
market" with a good supply of goods, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He also talked about the difficulties and challenges China is
facing, such as further economic restructuring and enterprise
reform.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that there exist problems during the transition
from the traditional planned economy to a socialist market one.
</P>
<P>
"However, we have gained rich experience through years of
reform," Li said. "We are confident that this difficult goal will
be reached by deepening the reform."

<HEADLINE> Dini Urges More Diplomacy to End Iraqi Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini urged Saturday a further push in diplomatic efforts to
resolve the crisis over U,N. arms inspections in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Not all the diplomatic avenues have been fully explored yet, "
he said, "even though recent developments have created a situation
of grave difficulty in Iraq."
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan said Friday "force may
have to be used as a last resort" in the ongoing confrontation
with the Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
He added that it was "foolhardy" of Saddam to continue refusing
access of U.N. inspectors to suspected chemical and biological
weapons sites.
</P>
<P>
In recent days the United States has warned that it too is
prepared to use force against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
According to Dini, Washington is "in constant contact with
other countries" on the subject of the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
He himself would be in contact with U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright later Saturday to "give her our opinion, which,
I repeat, is that a diplomatic solution must be found," said
Dini.
</P>
<P>
Asked what Italy's attitude would be if diplomatic channels
were unfruitful, Dini said, "We'll cross that bridge when we come
to it. We are not there yet and I hope we won't get there. "

origin of the funds, and the fairness in the allotment of funds
for the political organizations.

<P>
Alternate ways will also be explored to coordinate efforts and
develop the mechanisms of international cooperation in the
allotment of funds for the political organizations.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Rapid Growth And High Returns For Pudong's Foreign-funded Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Large foreign-funded
industrial projects in the Pudong New Area of Shanghai have one of
the fastest growth rates and highest returns in China, market
analysts say.
</P>
<P>
A recent study of 157 industrial projects since the Pudong New
Area was opened to attract foreign investment seven years ago,
each with at least 10 million US dollars in investment, found that
73.9 percent were operational. The projects took an average of
17.2 months to build, which is considered efficient by experts.
</P>
<P>
A 410-million-US-dollar Sino-Japanese color television project,
for example, produced its first color TV 18 months after
construction work started.
</P>
<P>
The projects now in operation have also proven profitable, with
80 percent already generating a profit.
</P>
<P>
With an investment of 50 million US dollars, Shanghai-Hitachi
Electrical, began production within a year of start of
construction, 11 months ahead of schedule, so the Japanese decided
to add another 80 million US dollars of investment. Because the
construction work was faster than in Japan for a similar-size
project, Japanese investors dubbed it "Pudong speed and Pudong
efficiency."
</P>
<P>
Last year, 10 multinationals added 255 million US dollars in
investment, and market analysts attribute this to the good
investment environment.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of the 157 projects surveyed are in
high-tech manufacturing funded by leading multinationals.
</P>
<P>
A "Brand-name strategy" has also contributed to the success. Of
the 52 foreign brands and 50 Chinese in production, 25 foreign
brands and 17 Chinese have a good share of the market both in and
outside China.
</P>
<P>
A program-controlled telephone switchboard produced by the
Sino-Belgian Shanghai-Bell has more than 45 percent of the China
market. Its price per telephone line is less than 100 US dollars,
compared with 260 US dollars for some foreign-made products in
China.

MONTEVIDEO -- Paraguay's cotton production in 1998 will double
that of 1997 to 300,000 gross tons, which is to be the first
increase in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Due to bad weather and low prices on the international market,
the country's cotton production suffered reduction for years.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the government started to provide technical assistance
and fertilizers to small producers, which helped increase the area
of cultivation and the yield per hectare.
</P>
<P>
Creating some 500,000 jobs and bringing hard currency into the
country, cotton is one of the pillar economies in Paraguay.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, SWITZERLAND, January 31 (Xinhua) -- China's Vice Premier
Li Lanqing on Saturday expressed his hope that China will join the
World Trade Organization (WTO) at an earliest possible date.
</P>
<P>
"Now that major progress has been made in recent negotiations,

and signed the final package agreements.
</P>

He said he believes that China needs WTO and vice versa,
adding, "Without China's membership, WTO can hardly play a bigger
role."

WASHINGTON, January 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen said today that any U.S. military attack on Iraq
would be "significant" but would not aim to destroy the country
and topple President Saddam Hussein from power.
</P>
<P>
"Let's not raise unreasonable expectations," Cohen told
reporters at the Pentagon. "We do not have as a goal the toppling
of Saddam Hussein."
</P>
<P>
He said the purpose of military attacks on Iraq would be to
devastate Saddam's ability to make chemical or biological weapons
or threaten his neighbors, but not devastate Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said diplomatic efforts were still under way to get
Baghdad to accept unfettered U.N. inspections for chemical and
biological weapons. And he said no attack decision had been made.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to visit Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states next
week.

<HEADLINE> Albright Arrives in Israel on Mideast Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright arrived here Saturday evening from London for
a whirlwind visit apparently with primary objectives to nudge
Israeli and Palestinian leaders into peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after her arrival, Albright immediately entered into
talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the
later's Jerusalem residence.
</P>
<P>
The projected Israel's troop redeployment in the West Bank
will dominate this round of discussion, but Albright will also
update Netanyahu on the scope of the impending U.S. military
strikes against Iraq and to coordinate in the event that Israel
is drawn into the theater of operations, informed sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government has not made its final decision on
the scope of troop redeployment since the Washington talks held
last week, which is one of the biggest issue hindering the
peace talks right now.
</P>
<P>
During the Washington talks with netanyahu and U.S. President
Bill Clinton was in favor of Netanyahu's proposal that Israel
implements partial and gradual troop pullbacks in the West Bank,
should the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) fulfill its
obligations of the signed accords.
</P>
<P>
But PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat, upon his return from Egypt
on Tuesday, rejected this proposal, saying he "would definitely
not agree" to such an idea.
</P>
<P>
Albright is scheduled to hold talks on Sunday with Arafat
in Ramallah, the PNA controlled West bank city.
</P>
<P>
Besides asking Arafat to make more compromise in reviving
the peace talks, Albright's talks with Arafat is likely
to touch on the PNA's public support of Iraq.
