UNITED AIR SAYS IT MAY MAKE BID FOR AMERICA WEST
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Calif., Colo., Nev., Ohio)  (bl) 
By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   United Airlines, the largest U.S. airline, said Wednesday that
it was interested in buying America West Airlines, the nation's
ninth-largest carrier, a move that would escalate its battle with
American Airlines in the West.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement, made after the stock market closed, came after
rumors about the acquisition appeared on the Internet and shares of
America West Holdings Corp., the owner of America West, rose nearly
8 percent on unusually high trading volume.
</P>
<P>
   Issuing its own statement, the Phoenix-based America West said
that it had been approached by a number of airlines about a range
of potential deals from a strategic alliance to a merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be no assurance that America West will engage in
discussions or enter into an agreement with any other company,''
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Both airlines refused to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the talks leaked after James Goodwin, president of UAL
Corp., United's parent company, briefed the leaders of the
carrier's pilot's union on a possible acquisition of America West
at a previously scheduled union meeting in Hawaii earlier this
week.
</P>
<P>
   United's interest in America West is seen as a response to two
recent moves by American Airlines to shore up its presence in the
West. In November, American said it was buying the Nevada-based
Reno Air for $124 million. Last month, it said it would enter into
a marketing partnership with Alaska Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Both deals were seen as attempts by American to defend itself
against United, whose low-cost Shuttle by United service on the
West Coast has enabled it to woo lucrative transcontinental
customers from American and on to its main line service.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Harris, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, estimated in a
report this week that American's moves would add 32 cents a share
to the annual earnings of AMR Corp., American's parent, while
costing UAL 29 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   America West has 111 airplanes serving nearly 100 cities across
the country and in Mexico from hubs in Phoenix, Las Vegas and
Columbus, Ohio. Since emerging from bankruptcy in 1994, it has not
enjoyed the same financial success as the other major domestic
airlines and is facing a possible strike by flight attendants.
</P>
<P>
   However, the airline, which is currently valued at about $900
million, posted strong quarterly results Wednesday, exceeding
expectations. Texas Pacific Group, the investment partnership run
by the financier David Bonderman, owns 42 percent of America West's
voting stock.
</P>
<P>
   Acquiring the airline would easily make United, which already
has hubs in Denver, Los Angeles and San Francisco, the dominant
airline in the West. Indeed, some analysts believe that United
would divert some of America West's jets to the East Coast, where
it recently announced plans to increase its flights at Dulles
International Airport outside Washington by 60 percent to fend off
a challenge by U S Airways.
</P>
<P>
   Merging the fleets of both airlines would not present a problem.
American West, like United, flies Boeing 737s, Airbus A320s and
Boeing 757s, though America West's 757s have different engines than
United's.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the two airlines could successfully merge their two
labor groups _ always a difficult task in the airline industry,
where seniority rules _ is another story.
</P>
<P>
   And there is also the danger that the Justice Department, which
is already investigating possible antitrust violations in the
airline industry, would block the deal.

AFTER YEARS OF CIRCLING, SUITOR LANDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NAAMAN NICKELL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The rumors had been around before. America West is going to
merge with (fill in the blank). America West is going to be bought
by (fill in the blank). But those never seemed to be more than
someone's fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   This time it was different. The rumors and rumors of rumors
weren't narrowly contained in Phoenix and other America West hubs.
This time they were all over the map, including on a couple of Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   It would be hard to say there was any surprise that UAL was
being touted as the ultimate suitor, simply because most of the
major airlines, even Southwest, had at one time or another been
mentioned as moving toward some type of combination with America
West.
</P>
<P>
   The rumors cropped up again and again because it seemed clear
almost from the time the airline emerged from bankruptcy that it
would not be flying alone forever. Of course, the fear was that
when it happened, hundreds, perhaps thousands, of jobs and a
substantial payroll would go away. And another corporate identity
would be lost, something the Valley has become extremely sensitive
about. Then there is that new headquarters building going up in
Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   The official announcement from America West Holdings Corp.
followed the rumors late Wednesday, but gave no hint as to what
might actually be happening other than the airline is attracting a
lot of interest. However, UAL later said it had contacted America
West about a possible acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to piquing the interest of suitors, America West
also had been attracting a lot of interest recently from investors.
Maybe this time something really would happen.
</P>
<P>
   The airline's climb from bankruptcy court to an attractive
takeover candidate has been a financial success, but some scars
have been left along the way. For instance, mechanics, pilots and
flight attendants unions have let it be known _ more than once _
that they weren't happy with working conditions, pay scales or
senior management. Many employees said they had made sacrifices to
help the airline survive and when survival seemed assured, they
were left out of the party.
</P>
<P>
   Often the focus of their complaints was on William Franke, the
man selected by investors to lead the airline after it had filed
for bankruptcy court protection.
</P>
<P>
   Franke had earned a reputation as a bright, dedicated, tough,
no-nonsense manager during his years with Phoenix-based Southwest
Forest Industries. He ultimately rose to become chairman and chief
executive of the company, fighting off a couple of determined
takeover attempts and some stubborn union officials, before
eventually selling the company to Stone Container Corp. for $32.25
a share for stock that had been drifting between $12 and $18 a
share for a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   When Franke was asked to serve as chairman of the board at
America West, his supporters believed that the characteristics that
had made him successful at Southwest Forest Industries and in
subsequent business operations would be used in good stead to get
the airline back on a sound financial basis.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't easy. There were internal management struggles and
external battles with lenders. It seemed not everyone thought
Franke was the only man for the job. But he was the one who got it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, once again, he may find himself in the midst of
negotiations to bring the best results not only for shareholders
but for employees and customers as well.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it also would be nice if, in the event the airline is
acquired, the America West name, logo and ``Your hometown airline''
identification would remain.
</P>
<P>
   But I wouldn't bet on it. &QL;

EGGELING GETTING BETTER WITH AGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A year ago, Dale Eggeling admitted she was more or
less just going through the motions in her 23rd season on the LPGA
Tour.
</P>
<P>
   She was getting up in age without a lot of victories _ none in
the previous three seasons _ and battling frustration weekly on a
tour that seemed to be getting younger and better.
</P>
<P>
   Much of her perspective changed on one memorable weekend last
February at Glendale's Oakmont Country Club, where Eggeling
outlasted monsoon rains that threatened to wash out the Los Angeles
Women's Championship, then held off a field that included many of
those good young stars and some hot-shooting elders.
</P>
<P>
   Her Sunday playoff win over Hiromi Kobayashi in the
rain-shortened 36-hole event earned Eggeling her third tour win, a
big jump in earnings and _ most importantly, she says _ a ton of
new-found confidence in her game.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't make her any younger, but it made age seem no longer
as important to her career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me realize that at 43 (she is now 44) I could still
compete if I applied myself,'' Eggeling said during a recent outing
at Oakmont. ``Now, I feel like I can play at this level until I'm
50.''
</P>
<P>
   She'll be back at Oakmont to defend her title next month in the
renamed Valley of the Stars Championship, set for Feb. 12-14.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a great thrill to be a defending champion,''
Eggeling said. ``I haven't had a lot of chances to do that, but I
always have a great time. Oakmont is a great course, and I'm glad
it's a tough one, because I seem to play better on difficult
courses.''
</P>
<P>
   Super sophs: USC sophomore Jennifer Rosales, the current NCAA
women's champion, and Arizona State sophomore Grace Park, reigning
U.S. women's amateur champ, lead a strong field for the TRW
Regional Challenge women's collegiate tournament set for Feb. 7-10
at Palos Verdes Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth annual 18-team event includes defending NCAA team
champion Arizona State, No. 2-ranked Arizona and No. 3-ranked USC.
Tulsa, ranked No. 4 nationally, will defend its tournament title on
the par-71, 5,801-yard course.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA benefit: The UCLA men's golf program will host its second
annual four-ball stroke-play fund-raiser March 28-30 at Primm
Valley Golf Course in Stateline, Nev. The 36-hole competition
features two-player teams using one partner's better-ball score.
Prizes will be awarded in gross and net divisions. Entry deadline
is Feb. 12. Information: (310) 206-6588.
</P>
<P>
   Remembering Pete: Pierce College baseball coach Bob Lofrano will
honor longtime area sportswriter Pete Kokon on Feb. 8 with the
first Pete Kokon memorial golf tournament at Woodland Hills Country
Club. Cost is $125 for individuals or $450 for foursomes, with
proceeds benefiting the Pierce baseball program.
</P>
<P>
   Kokon, a Woodland Hills member who died last year, was a
constant supporter of Valley high school and college athletics,
dating back to the 1930s. Registration deadline is Feb. 5 and the
field will be limited to 144 players. Information: (818) 348-5255
or (818) 716-8850.
</P>
<P>
   Names in the game: Roger Gunn, Lake Lindero's teaching pro and
two-time participant in the U.S. Open final, is now also in the
custom club-fitting business. He says his line of True Custom irons
is designed with teaching professionals in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to design a club that incorporates the best
playability features available in golf clubs today without making
the clubs cost-prohibitive,'' said Gunn, whose clubs will be
available at $449 with steel shafts and $520 in graphite.
</P>
<P>
   Gunn also is offering Titanium drivers for $299 and low-profile
fairway woods for $149, all custom fitted. He will introduce his
clubs at this year's PGA merchandise show in Orlando, Fla.
Information: (818) 889-0970. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Pepper Martin, Scholl Canyon marshall and Scholl co-course
record-holder (with Verdugo Hills pro Rich Contreras, both at
9-under-par 51), is back at the Glendale course after an extended
illness. During Martin's absence, another of Scholl's marshalls _
Lowell Schwartz _ had his own round to remember with a Thanksgiving
Day hole-in-one, scoring his first ace ``in 56 years'' with an
89-yard wedge shot on No. 11. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Welcome aboard mates: When Eric Rosendahl and Paul Hughes joined
the Verdugo Hills men's club two weeks ago, they had no idea the
game could be this easy. Playing three holes apart, both hit
holes-in-one in their first club tournament. Two weeks earlier at
the Tujunga three-par course, Bill Thomas got his holiday gift
ahead of schedule, acing No. 9 on Christmas Eve. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Junior golf: Four area players were top-five finishers in the
Southern California PGA Tournament of Junior Champions. Michael
Park of La Crescenta placed second at 71 in the boys' age 14-15
final at Newport Beach Country Club. In the younger division finals
at Hacienda GC, Grace Woo of Burbank placed first in the 9-hole
girls' 11-under competition at 44; Brett Kanda of La Crescenta tied
for first at 39 in boys' age 11-under nine-hole play; and Anthony
Kim of Studio City was fourth at 76 in the boys' 12-13 final. &QL;

producer, living with his wife and children on a mountaintop dense
with redwoods _ and on many mornings shrouded with fog _ near
Sausalito in Marin County, Calif. To ease the transition from a
loft in SoHo to the quasi-wilderness of Marin County, Harrison and
his wife, Carol, bought a 1960s redwood house, gutted it and
replicated elements of their Prince Street loft _ white walls,
slate floors and a stainless-steel staircase _ in the rustic shell.

 IF AMWEST DEAL FLIES, WHERE WILL VALLEY LAND?

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For 16 years, America West Airlines has helped link the nation's
sixth-largest city to worldwide mar kets while fostering economic
growth in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   It has offered some of the best ticket prices in the nation,
spurred the expansion of Sky Harbor Inter national Airport and
contributed millions of dollars to charities.
</P>
<P>
   Now the question is, how will life in the Valley change if
United Airlines buys out America West?
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of answers from America West or United, here are
some early indications: &QL; 
Consumers &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. What effect would there be on ticket prices?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. The market imperative says prices go up when competition
declines. But without knowing Unit ed's plan for the Phoenix
market, there's no predicting the outlook on ticket prices. Best
bet: Expect to pay more.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. Would the number of available flights and destinations
change?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. Once again, that's up to United. The answer wouldn't be
clear until they formulated a man agement plan.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. What if I'm holding an America West ticket? Would it be
valid?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. The ticket would be honored by United.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. What would happen to Amer ica West customers' frequent-flyer
miles?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. It is typical in a major buyout for the new owner to absorb
commitments such as frequent-flyer miles or gift certificates.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. Would United work with Mesa Air to provide air service to
rural parts of Arizona, such as Page and Yuma?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. That probably depends on whether United saw those deals as
moneymakers. &QL; 
Employee outlook &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. How would a buyout affect America West's 8,100 employees _
and the local job market?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. There is no telling how many Valley workers might lose their
jobs. The airline ranks as one of the Valley's most prominent
companies, but it's hardly overwhelming in a metro area that counts
1.51 million jobs. In the words of Ron Simon, an economist for the
state Department of Economic Security: ``Yes, they're big, but not
big enough to have a large impact on the local economy.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. Would workers be encouraged to join a union?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. United Airlines is the biggest employee-owned airline and
most of its employees are in unions, as are those at America West.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. What's the outlook for travel agents?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. They see dollars flying away. America West offers incentives
that have become rare in the industry: extra bucks for agents who
sell a lot of tickets and special contests that let them win free
trips. And travel agents haven't forgotten that United Airlines led
the push to cut their commissions on selling airline tick ets. &QL; 
Economic consequences &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. What would happen to the value of America West stock?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. Most likely, stock would be converted to United Airlines
shares, which could be a boon for stock holders.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. Would Phoenix stop being an airline hub?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. The Valley would probably remain one of Southwest Airlines'
major destinations. It's hard to imagine the nation's sixth-largest
city being shorted on air transporta tion. But there's prestige and
mar keting significance in having a home-based air carrier, and
that will be lost.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. Would there be a drop in corporate contributions to local
arts and charities?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. Probably. Just look what happened when major Valley banks
were bought out. National chains have to spread their philanthropy,
and are less inclined to give hefty local handouts.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. What would happen to Amer ica West's new corporate headquar
ters and reservation offices in Tempe?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. It would be a setback to the city in terms of lost taxes and
status, but Mayor Neil Giuiliano offers a more hopeful spin: ``I
would think if United Airlines is doing this, they're doing it to
expand and grow,'' he said. &UR; ``It could be very positive, if it
means they want to focus a hub for United Airlines out here.'' &QL; 
Sports impact &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. What would we call the Suns' basketball arena?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. It's likely a new corporate sponsor would buy the naming
rights. (Note: United Airlines al ready has an arena named for it,
the United Center in Chicago.) &QL; 
Loose ends &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. What would happen to the balance of the $5 million fine im
posed against America West by the Federal Aviation Administration
over allegations of lax maintenance and operations violations?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. America West has paid $2.5 million of the fine. The rest was
to be forgiven if the company carried out reforms agreed upon in a
settlement. United presumably would have to live by those terms.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. Would United be bound by Sky Harbor contracts at Terminal 4?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. Work has been humming along at Terminal 4 on a dozen new
gates for America West. It's unclear what effect, if any, a merger
would have on the project, which is being paid for by the airline.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. What would happen to Amer ica West Cargo?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. United just expanded its cargo operations, but the answer is
un known.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. Who are the America West board members? What impact would
the merger have on them?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. The board members are Wil liam Franke, chairman and CEO of
America West Holdings; John Goolsby, CEO of The Howard Hughes
Corp.; Denise O'Leary, private investor; Frederick Bradley Jr.,
senior vice president of Citi bank; Walter Klenz, chairman of
Beringer Wine Estates; Richard Schifter, managing director of Texas
Pacific Group; James Coulter, man aging director of Texas Pacific
Group; Richard Kraemer, president Chartwell Capital; John Tierney,
managing director of Castletown Financial Services; and Richard
Goodmanson, CEO of America West Airlines. All own stock in the
airline and could do well with the right offer for shareholders.

BUOYED BY BURE'S PRESENCE, PANTHERS BURY THE ISLANDERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.) (mk) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ The asking price for Pavel Bure was too high
for the Islanders. The Vancouver Canucks wanted too many players in
return, and Bure wanted too many dollars.
</P>
<P>
   So the Islanders passed on one of the few players in the game
who can single-handedly turn around a team's season.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, the Islanders got an up-close look at Bure when
he made his debut for the Florida Panthers at Nassau Coliseum. And
Bure showed the Islanders what he's worth: two goals in a 5-2
victory before 11,283 frustrated fans.
</P>
<P>
   The game was another miserable showing for the Islanders, who
are 0-10-1 in their last 11. They have not won since December 26.
</P>
<P>
   On his first goal, Bure split the defense, took a heads-up pass
from defenseman Robert Svehla, and skated in on goalie Felix
Potvin. The Islanders' 6-foot-8-inch defenseman Zdeno Chara used
his long reach to swat Bure, but by the time Bure had blasted past
him, it was much too late.
</P>
<P>
   Then, displaying moves that he hasn't used in nine months, Bure
faked left, right, and left again before stuffing the puck
underneath Potvin, who lost his stick as he extended himself across
the goal line. It was Bure's first goal since he scored in the
Canucks' final regular-season game last April.
</P>
<P>
   Bure scored his second goal on a Panthers' 5-on-3 advantage
midway through the second period, giving Florida a 4-1 lead.
Standing at the right post, Bure tapped in a pass from Ray Whitney,
who scored the Panthers' third goal earlier in the period.
</P>
<P>
   A faint cheer was heard after Bure scored, but those polite
cheers for his artistry turned angry late in the game when a large
group took aim at Mike Milbury, the Islanders' coach and general
manager. ``Mike must go, Mike must go,'' they chanted.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Rocket landed in New York on Tuesday, but it was not
known until Wednesday afternoon, after Bure met with the Panthers'
coaching staff, that he was ready to face the Islanders. After he
was given a physical examination, Bure skated with his teammates
for the first time at a morning practice. He wore No. 10, the same
number he did in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two minutes into the game, Bure made his first NHL
appearance since last April, stepping onto the ice for a Panthers'
power play. At even strength, Bure, a left-handed right wing,
played with the Russians Viktor Kozlov and Oleg Kvasha.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Reichel scored the game's first goal at 6 minutes 42
seconds of the opening period to give the Islanders the lead. He
controlled a Panthers' turnover at the blue line and unleashed a
wicked slap shot that deflected off Kirk McLean's glove before
entering the net.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Islanders have proved this season, they can't hold a
lead. Less than a minute after Reichel's goal, Johan Garpenlov tied
the game 1-1 after poking the puck into the goal off Potvin's leg
pad. Potvin had stopped Jaroslav Spacek's shot, but was unaware
that the puck lay under his pad.
</P>
<P>
   In the third period, Oleg Kvasha scored the Panthers' fifth
goal, and Ted Crowley scored the Islanders' second goal late in the
game.

<P>
   Not Being Invited Was the Honor
</P>
<P>
   This has started out as a year of nots for ANDREW CUOMO, the
U.S. secretary of Housing and Urban Development.
</P>
<P>
   First there was the Senate seat he decided not to run for. Then
there was the speech he did not attend.
</P>
<P>
   The White House told him to stay away.
</P>
<P>
   Following a long Washington tradition, the administration orders
one Cabinet secretary to skip the State of the Union speech _ and
the handshaking and standing-ovation rituals in the House chamber _
each year. The idea is to keep everyone in the line of succession
to the presidency from being in the same room at the same time.
(Cuomo's job makes him 10th in line after the vice president, the
speaker of the House and the president pro tempore of the Senate.)
</P>
<P>
   So Cuomo watched the speech at home in McLean, Va.
</P>
<P>
   It was just as well. His wife, Kerry Kennedy Cuomo, was in
Ireland. ``He had baby-sitting duty,'' said a spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   His year-old daughter, Michela, was asleep long before the
speech began. His 4-year-old twins, Cara and Mariah, watched with
him. ``They applauded at the right moments,'' the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, Secret Service agents were posted outside, just in
case. ``The secretary didn't see them,'' a spokeswoman said. ``They
were in the car.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Side Of the Gavel
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ BURTON ROBERTS's retirement was short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts _ the irascible jurist who was the model for a central
character in Tom Wolfe's novel ``The Bonfire of the Vanities'' _
stepped down as the chief administrative judge of state Supreme
Court in the Bronx at the end of 1998, having reached the mandatory
retirement age of 76.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 25, he will unretire to become a lawyer in private
practice, working with Fischbein Badillo Wagner Harding, a
Manhattan law firm with a powerhouse reputation in municipal
affairs. He will tutor younger lawyers and maybe present a case or
two himself.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts spent five decades in the judicial system as a
prosecutor and judge, but he was never in private practice. Why
now?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that I could just sit around and not do
anything,'' Roberts said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   He said much the same thing at a breakfast a few days ago with
SCOTT MOLLEN, whose father, MILTON, also moved from a judgeship to
private practice. Mollen mentioned Fischbein Badillo and called one
of the partners, RICHARD FISCHBEIN.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Roberts promised not to forget which side of the
bench he is now on.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I appear in court,'' he said, ``there will only be one
judge. I will be Burton B. Roberts, Esquire.''
</P>
<P>
   That new title may have its rewards. Roberts made $117,000 a
year as a judge. Fischbein would say only, ``He'll do better
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Cabby Hails Mayor
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just like that, SAM GOLDSTEIN has a new taxi.
</P>
<P>
   His old one was crushed when a parking garage on the Lower East
Side collapsed last week. MAYOR RUDOLPH GIULIANI heard about how
Goldstein had fished his medallion out of the rubble, and so did a
dealer in Queens, who handed over a new Ford Crown Victoria with no
money down. The dealer agreed to wait until Goldstein's insurance
settlement comes through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been driving for six mayors,'' Goldstein said at City
Hall, where Giuliani gave him the keys to the new cab, ``and this
mayor is the best mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   This prompted the commissioner of the Taxi and Limousine
Commission, DIANE McGRATH-McKECHNIE, to say, ``How many more cabs
do you want?''
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein did not hesitate. ``I don't want nothing,'' he said.
``I just want one cab. I love this city. The city is the best city
in the world.'' And then, in a roomful of reporters, he said: ``You
guys, you don't know nothing. Ask me about the city, I can tell
you. Ask me questions, I'll give you the answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani seemed pleased. ``This is our next deputy mayor,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Goldstein wants such a job. ``You got the headaches, I
don't got the headaches,'' he said. ``I got my cab, I'm free.''
</P>
<P>
   Then a television reporter asked what Goldstein thought of the
Mayor's crackdown on taxi drivers. ``Should I tell you something?
He's right,'' Goldstein said as mayoral aides applauded.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Ms. McGrath-McKechnie (perhaps wondering whether
Goldstein was by now under consideration for her job) grabbed him
by the arm and escorted him out of the Blue Room.

AIRLINE ACQUISITIONS FLY IN FACE OF RECENT HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAX JARMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a lengthy hiatus, airline mergers are making a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas-based American Airlines broke the ice in November with
its announced acquisition of Nevada's Reno Air Inc.
</P>
<P>
   And now, Chicago's United Airlines has confirmed an interest in
acquiring Tempe-based America West Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   For almost a decade, instead of scooping one another up,
airlines have contented themselves with code-sharing agreements and
frequent-flyer alliances.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, last year's deal between Northwest and
Continental, in which Northwest bought a small stake in Continental
and cemented a code-sharing deal. Under the arrangement, Northwest
passengers can seamlessly arrange travel involving connections with
Continental flights.
</P>
<P>
   America West also has such an alliance with Continental, as well
as with Northwest and several smaller carriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alliances will be the rule, and mergers will be the
exception,'' Samuel Buttrick, airline industry analyst for
PaineWebber in New York, said last year of the growing trend toward
code-sharing alliances.
</P>
<P>
   But now analysts such as Buttrick believe mergers could be
coming back as well.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are reluctant to predict a return to the go-go days of
the early 1980s, when a spate of airline mergers ended in disaster
for many carriers. But, they believe the American deal and now
United's advances toward America West could signal a renewed
interest in consolidations as flush carriers move to fill in gaps
in their networks and enhance market share by buying up smaller
carriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (the American-Reno deal) could very well trigger a rapid
one-two-three realignment in the industry,'' Julius Maldutis, an
airline industry analyst at CIBC Oppenheimer, recently told the
``Wall Street Journal.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts believe United's overtures toward America West are in
response to American's Reno deal and growing insecurity about its
dominant position on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Besides filling in gaps in its Western route system, America
West's franchise would be a huge boost to United's West Coast
presence.
</P>
<P>
   American, United's biggest rival, announced in November that it
was buying Reno Air for $124 million. Later, it revealed a
code-sharing agreement and frequent-flyer linkup with Alaska
Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Both Reno and Alaska have extensive route networks in California
that spill over into other Western states and compete directly with
United's low-fare Shuttle by United.
</P>
<P>
   Besides ferrying people around the West, United's Shuttle feeds
passengers into the carrier's San Francisco hub and onto more
profitable long-haul and transcontinental flights.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts speculate that American's acquisition of Reno was
fueled by the prospect of feeding more passengers into long-haul
flights out of American's hub in Los Angeles. &QL;

COLUMN: PHAT CITY CAN'T LAST, FASHION ARCHAEOLOGISTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Why does the goose-down bubble jacket endure as a
staple of urban street fashion? Why has down been down for five
years? The customers at Dr. Jay's in downtown Brooklyn had no
trouble answering that question as they tried on the puffy jackets
Tuesday afternoon. Over and over they replied, ``It keeps you
warm.''
</P>
<P>
   This was true but unconvincing. The teen-agers were about to
spend $190 each for a North Face jacket to wear out on Fulton
Street, where the temperature was 54 degrees. Hypothermia was not
imminent. They demanded a bulky coat named after an icy mountain
slope _ the brand is known reverently as ``The Face'' _ even though
the most perilous ascent they faced on the way home would be the
subway stairs.
</P>
<P>
   You could try explaining the bubble jackets as merely a
manifestation of outdoors chic, like the Timberland boots that have
displaced Nike sneakers among teen-agers, or the Land Rovers that
suburbanites drive to the mall.
</P>
<P>
   But for true devotees of outdoors gear _ the people who actually
ascend mountain faces _ the trend has been toward a slimmer look,
with the Michelin-man down parkas of the 1970s giving way to
jackets insulated with sleek layers of Thinsulate and Polartec.
</P>
<P>
   Why, in an age that worships thinness, have young males in New
York (and their imitators across the country) brought back the
obese look? Perhaps the best answer comes from Jose Ysa, a
21-year-old clerk at Dr. Jay's, who is accustomed to customers
admiring the jackets by murmuring, ``Yo, the Face is phat.'' In
this instance, Ysa believes, fat is phat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys like jackets because it makes them look big,'' he
explained. ''It's a street thing. You want to look tough and pumped
up.''
</P>
<P>
   This jacket-as-steroid theory jibes with a variety of other
phenomena in biology and fashion. Males of all types, from
prehistoric animals to 16th-century courtiers to modern
businessmen, have prepared for confrontations by making themselves
look bigger.
</P>
<P>
   That's how the puffer fish got its name; that's why a bull
displays its flank to a matador. Gorillas thrust out their chests
in what's called a ``broadside display,'' which can provoke the
``looming effect,'' a surge of fear in the beholder that's
triggered by the sight of a large hairy object nearby.
</P>
<P>
   This broadside display is evident in the modern business suit.
The length of the jacket, the padded shoulders and the flare of the
lapels all make the upper torso look larger and stronger. By
wearing a tie along with it, the man avoids a classic display of
vulnerability, the exposed neck.
</P>
<P>
   The bubble jacket's padded body and high, thick collar achieve
these same effects, but more dramatically. The jacket brings to
mind a coat of armor _ or, more precisely, the 16th-century
fashions that evolved from the outfits of those armored soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Fashionable courtiers in the Renaissance adopted the doublet, a
jacket that had originally been worn as a protective layer beneath
a suit of armor. The cotton padding of this jacket, called bombast
(the source of the modern word meaning overinflated verbiage), was
gradually increased to give courtiers the pumped-up look.
</P>
<P>
   ``The puffy doublets gave rulers like Henry VIII the
broad-shouldered outline of a soldier in armor,'' said Anne
Hollander, an art historian and the author of ``Sex and Suits'' and
``Seeing Through Clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   That look, she said, ``persisted among kings and courtiers even
as armor itself was becoming outmoded. Like today's bubble jacket,
the clothes were a social armor. They sent a powerful, menacing
message: Don't trifle with me.''
</P>
<P>
   The fashion-conscious of the 16th century put slits in their
clothes (mimicking the damage inflicted during battle) and pulled
balls of fabric out through these slits to heighten the puffy
effect.
</P>
<P>
   The collar, which began as a thin fabric around the neck, grew
to the size of a bubble-jacket collar, and then kept growing into
an enormous pleated ruff.
</P>
<P>
   Could the bubble jacket follow a similar evolution toward the
rococo? Ysa, the clerk at Dr. Jay's, has his doubts. After looking
at pictures of Henry VIII and other 16th-century fashion plates, he
said, ``Maybe this would go over with the freaky people in the
Village. But trust me. This will not sell in Brooklyn.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hollander was willing to venture a couple of predictions.
First, that the women who have adopted the bubble jacket will soon
tire of looking fat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Puffing up their bodies is something that women will do
occasionally,'' she said. ``You saw it in the 16th century, too.
But the look doesn't last long.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hollander's second prediction is that men will eventually
abandon the neo-bombast look, too. No matter how powerful the
bubble jackets make them feel, they will eventually succumb to the
far greater force of fashion. ``Anything full is bound to slim
down,'' she said. ``We saw that in the 17th century, when the puffy
look collapsed and men began showing flat chests and narrow
shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   If that happens on the streets of Brooklyn, the customers of Dr.
Jay's will suddenly lose all interest in keeping warm.

PATAKI EMBARKS ON QUEST FOR NATIONAL IMAGE
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: N.Y., Va., Ill., Mo.) (bl) 
By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Less than three months after handily winning
re-election, Gov. George Pataki is taking his first concrete steps
toward bolstering his national presence. His aides announced
Wednesday that he had created two political action committees and
scheduled two speeches in the Midwest in February, the beginning of
a series around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has sought recently to establish an image as a
get-the-job-done politician who excels at such bedrock Republican
policies as cutting taxes while skirting contentious social issues.
In an unusual rift, he has upbraided congressional Republicans,
saying they have become so preoccupied with impeaching President
Clinton that they have failed to address the public's deepest
concerns. He says he has not made that mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki is believed to be testing his chances of landing a spot
on the Republican national ticket in 2000. And his aides said he
was hoping that by showing off his record in New York, he could
overcome what is seen as one of his biggest handicaps as he tries
to broaden his influence: his support for abortion rights and other
moderate social views, which clash with those of the dominant,
conservative wing of his party.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has scheduled a speech at the University of Chicago on
Feb. 5, and another about two weeks later before the Missouri
Republican State Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor will speak about a positive message that unites
not only Republicans but also the American people,'' said his
spokeswoman, Zenia Mucha. ``These types of discussions have not
been the focus of the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   The events are not the governor's first appearances around the
nation, but they are among the first for which he has courted
publicity. During his first term, he went to other states to
collect campaign contributions, but he rarely disclosed that he was
doing so. He also gave several speeches for pay, usually for around
$15,000 each, with his aides typically giving reporters no more
than a few hours' notice before he left the state.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki is the most successful political fund-raiser in New York
state's history, having reaped $35 million in his two gubernatorial
campaigns, and he is expected to have little difficulty filling the
coffers of his two new committees, both of which are called the
21st Century Freedom PAC.
</P>
<P>
   One of the committees is set up under federal rules and is to be
used to support federal candidates. The other is based in Virginia
and is to back state and local candidates. Virginia has some of the
loosest fund-raising restrictions in the country, including no
limit on contributions. Like Pataki, several presidential
contenders have also created PACs in Virginia in an effort to get
around the rules in their own states.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki could not spend the money from the two committees on a
formal bid for the Presidency; he would have to set up a separate
presidential account. But he can and intends to use the committees
to pay for travel, including the Midwest trips.

UNITED AIRLINES BIDS FOR AMERICA WEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAWN GILBERTSON  
 and PETER CORBETT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ America West Airlines, the hometown carrier that
soared into the airline major leagues, went bankrupt and prospered
again, is being pursued by United Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago-based carrier, responding to rumors swirling about
an impending marriage of the two carriers, said late Wednesday that
it's interested in buying America West.
</P>
<P>
   United is the nation's largest carrier; America West, the ninth
largest.
</P>
<P>
   America West officials said only that it has been contacted by
``a number of airlines'' about a possible merger or alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``America West will have no further comment unless and until it
enters into any such agreement or determines not to pursue such
transactions,'' a terse statement said.
</P>
<P>
   America West's stock, which has had a nice runup the past few
weeks, rose $1.38 a share Wednesday on three times the normal
trading volume.
</P>
<P>
   The rumor, which surfaced late in the trading day in a report on
TheStreet.com, a popular online financial news service, was no
doubt a factor as was America West's release of record earnings of
$108.6 million for 1998. At Wednesday's closing price of $19.50,
America West's market value is about $880 million. United's stock
fell $2.88, also on heavier than normal trading, closing at $61.19.
</P>
<P>
   A sale, which America West and analysts say there's no assurance
of, would have dramatic implications in Phoenix if it plays out
like a lot of mergers with layoffs, cost cutting and elimination of
duplicate service.
</P>
<P>
   America West is one of the Valley's largest employers, with
about 8,000 employees, and it's the largest airline at Sky Harbor
International with more than 200 daily departures.
</P>
<P>
   Its low costs and competition with Southwest Airlines, the No. 2
carrier at Sky Harbor, have given Phoenix travelers some of the
lowest airfares in the country, while its hub system offers the
nonstop service business travelers crave.
</P>
<P>
   If United does buy America West, Arizona would lose another
corporate headquarters and a chunk of the community involvement
that goes with it.
</P>
<P>
   America West is prominent around town and active in charities.
It's perhaps best known for paying to have its name on the
basketball and hockey arena in downtown Phoenix. Its buildings are
scattered throughout Tempe and it's finishing up a big new
headquarters complex off Mill Avenue in downtown Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   While the announcement seemed to catch industry analysts off
guard, they say the potential buyout of America West is no
surprise. Observers on Wall Street and elsewhere have long
speculated about a sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``America West has had a ``For sale'' sign on the door for
several years,'' said Samuel Buttrick, airline analyst with
PaineWebber Inc. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: The major investors who brought the airline out of
bankruptcy in 1994, including affiliates of Continental Airlines,
were buying into a turnaround story and the turnaround has long
since been accomplished. Some, including Texas financier David
Bonderman, have already cashed out some of their shares as America
West's stock price has risen.
</P>
<P>
   America West Chairman William Franke, who was brought in by then
Gov. Fife Symington to help run America West and has stayed on
longer than expected, has never ruled out a sale. But in an
interview with ``The Arizona Republic'' last year, he put the odds
of a buyout of America West at less than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   He said alliances, like the marketing pact between Northwest and
Continental and America West's own agreement with Continental, are
a better way to go because of the headaches of combining airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a much more complicated option than combining Bank A
with Bank B,'' he said. ``You have different airplanes, maintenance
and investor issues. You have different work rules because most of
the airline industry is unionized. You have a different theory on
who your market is and what your customer looks like.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Franke is a longtime number cruncher whose utmost concern
has always been shareholders' interests. He's one of the airline's
biggest shareholders, with more than 2 percent of the outstanding
Class B stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Left to their own devices I think America West management
would simply sell to the highest bidder,'' Buttrick said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say United's interest in the deal boils down to one
word: competition. Archrival American Airlines has been beefing up
its West Coast presence with the pending purchase of Reno Air and a
marketing pact with Alaska Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   United is the No. 1 carrier on the West Coast, so it's an
important stronghold to protect, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Holly Hegeman, who runs her own airline industry website but
broke the story on TheStreet.com, said in the story that United
needs planes and would shift many of America West's Airbus aircraft
to its hub in Washington, D.C., while keeping the other planes in
Phoenix to battle American.
</P>
<P>
   Hegeman didn't cite any sources in the story but later, in an
interview with ``The Republic,'' said she would not have gone with
her report on the merger if she had not been able to confirm it
from a number of reliable sources.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts don't think an America West-United deal will fly, or at
least hope it won't.
</P>
<P>
   Buttrick says a purchase of America West by United would face
tough scrutiny by antitrust regulators, as their route systems
heavily overlap. A more appropriate deal to fend off competition
would involve linking up frequent flyer programs or a similar
marketing pact.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Starkman, an analyst with Warburg Dillon Read, said it
would be tough to mesh United's high-cost structure with America
West's low-cost operation.
</P>
<P>
   With United's costs it would have a difficult time competing
with Southwest Airlines in the Phoenix market, he said, adding that
America West's Phoenix hub would duplicate what United already has
in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think America West would be a good fit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An airline executive, who did not wish to be identified, doubts
the merger will occur, saying Continental Airlines still controls
50 percent of the voting stock for America West and would not want
to compete with the combination of United and America West.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Boyd, an airline consultant with the Boyd Group in
Evergreen, Colo., is particularly wary of a United-America West
combination.
</P>
<P>
   He says it would a ``major league disaster'' for Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would reduce competition significantly,'' he said. ``It
would hurt the consumer. It would hurt the employees. The only
people that would benefit are the people involved in the stock
play.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple Valley travel agents agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be hell for consumers,'' said Barbara Klink, owner of
Lincoln Center Travel of Scottsdale. ``The airfares would be higher
out of Phoenix. There would be limited competition, especially from
Phoenix to Chicago (O'Hare), Los Angeles, San Francisco and
Denver.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix travel agent Jen Brown gasped in astonishment when she
heard of the proposed buyout of America West. Her next reaction:
``Oh gosh, that would be terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who works at Travelworks in Metrocenter, doesn't want to
lose a hometown airline that is generous to agents, with extra cash
and free trips for those who sell lots of tickets. United Airlines,
by contrast, has led the way in cutting commissions to travel
agents.
</P>
<P>
   And as a former America West employee, Brown is eligible to be
rehired, a privilege that might not survive a buyout. On the other
hand, Brown points out that United has a much higher pay scale for
its employees. &QL;

JOB'S NO FOX TROT, JUST HARD WORK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Third in an annual four-part series on the best and worst of Los
Angeles' sports media. Today: The analyst/colormen.
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jim Fox leans forward on the edge of one of the
orange loge seats in Section 27 of the Forum to take in a Kings
morning skate Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He wears a sportcoat and jeans, knows he needs a shave and his
hair isn't anywhere near perfect. But he's got time _ about nine
hours to go before he'll be on TV doing the Kings game against the
Colorado Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   Vanity can wait. This is content-gathering for the analyst who,
for the past nine seasons, has been Bob Miller's partner as well as
teacher on the Fox Sports West and KCAL Channel 9 telecasts.
</P>
<P>
   A three-hour game telecast is about a 12-hour process for Fox,
and it starts here with collecting as much information as he can on
both teams. That's weeding through stacks of statistics and
Internet story printouts and talking to players and coaches in both
locker rooms before he feels he's adequately prepared for the
telecast that starts with an intro before the 7:35 p.m. faceoff.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Fox's TV time begins a half-hour before that,
co-hosting the ``Break the Ice'' show with Bill Macdonald.
</P>
<P>
   And before that, there are production meetings starting at 4
p.m., taped interviews with players between 5 and 5:30 p.m.,
rehearsals and about 15 minutes to wolf down a dinner.
</P>
<P>
   It's game No. 44 of 82 on the schedule. But it's a work ethic
that Fox developed long ago as a right winger for the Kings during
a 10-year playing career cut short by injuries to both knees at age
29.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier and easier to get away from playing each year that
I'm a broadcaster,'' says the 38-year-old Fox. ``When I played, I
treated it as a 24-hour-a-day job. When the season was over, I was
already targeting the next training camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox was one of those steady hard-working players who may have
never led the team in scoring _ not with Marcel Dionne, Luc
Robitaille, Bernie Nicholls and, in his final season, Wayne Gretzky
around. But Fox ended up in every top 10 offensive category in
Kings history, currently seventh all-time in scoring.
</P>
<P>
   So, long days of hockey aren't anything new. Since he has eased
away from coordinating projects in the Kings' community relations
department, his attention has been strictly on the broadcasting end
the past few seasons. As a result, he's able to easily spot the
nuances of the game so he can explain them with the Telestrator
during replays and between periods.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the focus, intensity and that power of concentration
that a player has to see so many things happening on the ice that I
don't even think he can describe how it works _ but there he is,
having to describe plays,'' said Bob Borgen, the Kings' game
telecast producer who has known Fox since he first came to the team
as a first-round draft pick (10th overall) in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone handles the Telestrator better than Jim,
which in a telecast for an L.A. audience is critical,'' added
Borgen. ``Most times, he's seeing the replay for the first time,
but he knows where he's going with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still 30 years later, but we're teaching the sport to the
city, and Jim does it the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Miller, in his 26th year with the Kings: ``I learn
something new every game from Jim.''
</P>
<P>
   After retiring early in the '89-90 season after a year off and
an aborted comeback, Fox admits it took him about four years before
he even began to feel comfortable talking into a microphone and
feeding the right information into the broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   One of his tricks is producing a legal pad-sized information
sheet for each game to help him focus. During the hours before the
game, Fox tries to develop five storylines on each team. Even if he
uses only one or two on the air, it's worth the research and
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting team writers always look for Fox for updates on the
Kings _ a sign that he knows his stuff. On this Tuesday, Colorado
colorman and former NHL player Peter McNab spend almost an hour
exchanging information.
</P>
<P>
   After the Avalanche practice ends at about noon, Fox heads home
for lunch, a workout and arranges his notes again before he returns
to the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   It's a routine that new Kings radio analyst Cammi Granato pays
careful attention to as she tries to find her way around a
broadcasting career. Fox helped introduce her to all the players
and had her next to him as he did interviews to see how the Q-and-A
process went from the other side of the mike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was totally unprepared (when I first started),'' said Fox,
who relied on Miller when he first started. ``I thought all you had
to do was sound smart. It doesn't work that way.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, hard work is the only way Fox knows.
</P>
<P>
   THE TOP 10  &QL; 
1. Jim Fox, Kings TV: So good, they named the network after him. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2. Rich Marotta, boxing TV: (begin ital!You(end ital) work with
Tom Kelly and try to get a complete sentence in. Actually, on the
local boxing shows, Marotta and Kelly work as a pretty darn nice
team. Marotta continues to be the consummate professional in
whatever he does. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3. Brian Hayward, Ducks TV: He's a Cornell grad, and it shows. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4. Jim Hefner, USC basketball radio: At least he kept his job. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   5. Paul Sunderland, college basketball TV: Don't you wish pro
beach volleyball comes back someday? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   6. Stu Lantz, Lakers TV and radio: Ranked this high mostly as a
process of elimination. Can't wait to hear what lockout-related
take the ex-Laker has when he comes back. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   7. Sparky Anderson, Angels TV: We know he's been relieved of his
duties, but . . . it's too hard to let go. Expect Rex Hudler to
make the top five next year. But for now, let us have one last
fractured phrase from good ol' Sparky. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   8. John Jackson, high school football TV: Has helped give
polished exposure to a weekly event that's only going to get more
popular as a local TV event. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   9. Rick Davis, Galaxy TV: Network quality at the local level
helps many novices understand what's going on. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   10. Can't we get a colorman on UCLA basketball radio, or did all
the money in the athletic department go to the ``Keep Bob Toledo''
fund? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SPECIAL RECOGNITION  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cammi Granato, Kings radio: You gotta start somewhere. We
completely support the team's move to use the U.S. Olympic gold
medalist as a broadcaster, but until the time comes to where she
decides to stop playing (she's going next month to another
tournament and training for the 2002 Olympics), this will only be a
part-time thing and on-air improvement won't show. Granato has been
pulled between endorsement appearances, clinics and workouts, with
broadcasting fitting in there somewhere. During the All-Star break,
for example, she'll be in Tampa, Fla., wearing a mic while playing
in a Heroes game featured on ESPN Saturday. She's back Monday for a
Kings women's ice hockey clinic in Panorama City, then heads to
Dallas for Wednesday's start of a four-game road trip. She says
she's getting good feedback from those around here and has already
overcome a few early hurdles, but at this pace, it's going to be a
very difficult road. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE BOTTOM FIVE  &QL; 
1. Bill Walton, UCLA basketball TV: Picked up a case of Chick
Hearnia and referred to Travis Reed as Travis Grant the other day.
Which is better than Travis Fryman and, sure, isn't enough to give
him this black mark. But because he's seems to have so much
personally invested in each win and loss, his sometimes harsh
remarks sound almost as if he's trying to light a fire under
certain players. That's the coach's job, Bill. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2. Billy Ray Smith, UCLA football radio: His performance this
year was almost like the team's: entertaining first part, but by
the Rose Bowl, he lost all bodily functions. He actually screamed
on the air for someone to ``come in and smash (Wisconsin running
back Ron) Dayne in the mouth'' to stop him. And his crying during
the UCLA-Miami game was embarrassing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3. Darren Eliot, Ducks radio: Also a Cornell grad, but it
doesn't show. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4. Kurt Rambis, college basketball TV: Has a fine career as a
coach. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   5. George Raveling, college basketball TV: Had a fine career as
a coach. &QL;

JORDAN CAN STILL DRAW A CROWD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERMUDA DUNES _ Every year people would come to the desert for a
vaudeville show and a golf tournament would break out. In the
nascent years of the Bob Hope Classic two of the most illustrious
entertainers of their day enchanted their galleries by turning a
round of golf into a running gag.
</P>
<P>
   It was quite possibly their best gig, Hope and his good friend
Bing Crosby trading barbs and bogeys for a few days before
relinquishing the stage to a PGA Tour itinerant, some poker-faced
player who was just as apt to be named Maxwell or Nieporte as
Palmer or Nicklaus.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of the 40th running of the tournament it was
yesterday once more. The 10th group off the 10th tee at Bermuda
Dunes Country Club on Wednesday was so beguiling, the 95-year-old
host of the tournament was delivered to the tee in a golf cart just
in time to send the foursome off.
</P>
<P>
   The pairing of Payne Stewart with retired basketball superstar
Michael Jordan, unsigned basketball star Charles Barkley and former
All-Pro receiver Roy Green created more buzz in this retirement
enclave than did President Clinton's state-of-the-union promises to
shore up Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Jordan had finished hitting a practice bucket of
balls, more people than you'll find inside the Sports Arena the
next time the Clippers host the Chicago Bulls had surrounded the
414-yard, par-4 layout. White-haired fans, red-and-black-clad fans,
basketball-toting-fans and fans carrying infants wearing Air Jordan
sneakers, they all were standing four and five deep to eyeball
arguably the most transcendental celebrity of the late 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
   When Jordan stepped up to the tee for his first shot the fairway
appeared to get chill bumps. The blades of freshly mowed grass sure
looked like they were standing as straight as the hair on people's
arms.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, they simply might have been at full alert after
getting wind of Barkley's performance on the adjacent driving
range. Barkley's game is so laughable, he provided the perfect foil
for Jordan, the straight-hitting straight man.
</P>
<P>
   The two engaged in a repartee that they no doubt carried over to
the 19th hole. All either player had to do was open his mouth and
the crowd, as if on cue, broke out into belly laughs. If you didn't
know better, you would have thought the round came with its own
laugh track.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing,'' an exasperated Barkley told Jordan at one
point. ``They'll laugh at anything you say.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was never funnier than when he watched one of Barkley's
knee-high shots scream off the clubface and deadpanned, ``Watch
out, groundhogs!''
</P>
<P>
   A fan got into the act later in the round, yelling after Barkley
had defiled yet another drive, ``Don't quit your day job!''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, of course, did just that last week. Despite playing with
a torn tendon on his right pointer finger, he managed to look like
a million bucks (Nassau change for him) in his first post-NBA
competitive foray. His round featured two birdies, six bogeys, a
stretch of four pars and two DNFs (he twice picked up his ball
after hitting his drives out of bounds).
</P>
<P>
   As he did so often on the basketball court, Jordan saved his
best on the course for last, sinking a snaking 30-foot putt on the
9th green for a birdie 3.
</P>
<P>
   If that was vintage Jordan, Barkley's day (and game) was
capsulized by his approach shot on the foursome's ninth hole: It
left his club like the space shuttle at launchoff, flying the green
and sailing straight over the heads of the spectators in the stands
behind the hole.
</P>
<P>
   When Jordan saw that, he dropped to his knees, fell to the
ground and nearly swallowed his cigar. He rolled around on the
grass, laughing his ash off for as long as the final 20 seconds
take to play in your average NBA game.
</P>
<P>
   The God-awful truth is Barkley swings a club like Shaquille
O'Neal shoots free throws. When he's practicing, his swing is as
pretty as a sunny, cloudless desert day. But when the shot counts,
Barkley's mechanics become a herky-jerky, hitch-on-the-downswing
mess. Stewart tried repeatedly (and patiently) to help him but
eventually threw his hands up in defeat.
</P>
<P>
   It's not an exaggeration to say Barkley's club tosses traveled
farther than many of his shots. His playing partners practically
lost their voices yelling ``fore.''
</P>
<P>
   And to think Jordan turns to golf for peace and quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I love it,'' he said between shots toward the end
of the round. ``It's not peace and quiet today. But normally.''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed peculiar that David Duval, the hottest golfer on the
planet with eight wins in the past 16 months, could spit and not
hit a soul here while an amateur with a 10-handicap (or so they
said) needed a couple of bodyguards and a dozen security types to
navigate the few hundred yards from the last green to the
clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, though, summed up the phenomenon with a minimum of
fuss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's because he's M.J.,'' said Stewart, who gets our early
vote for Sportsman of the Year for staying calm in the circus-like
atmosphere that surrounded him. ``He's an icon.''
</P>
<P>
   Turns out he's a pretty fair golfer and a funny man, too.

$116 MILLION PUNITIVE AWARD AGAINST AETNA
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif.) (bl) 
By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A California jury on Wednesday awarded $116 million in punitive
damages to a patient's widow who contends her husband died after a
subsidiary of Aetna Inc., the nation's largest health insurer,
delayed approving treatment for stomach cancer that its own doctors
had recommended. Lawyers on both sides called it the largest such
verdict against a health maintenance organization.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna said it was confident that the damages would be overturned
on appeal, as would a finding by the jury in San Bernardino County
Superior Court last week awarding $4.5 million in actual damages in
the 1995 death of David Goodrich, 44, a local prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   The case, which comes against a growing national backlash
against the restrictive policies of HMOs, is unusual because most
Americans are barred by a 1974 federal law from suing their health
insurer or HMO for any damages except unpaid bills even if
treatment they are entitled to is refused. The 1974 law does not
even allow collection of legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   Goodrich's widow, Teresa, could sue because her husband was a
government employee not covered by the Employee Retirement and
Income Security Act.
</P>
<P>
   Goodrich collapsed in a courtroom in San Bernardino, 60 miles
east of Los Angeles, in 1992. His doctors in Aetna Health Plans of
California said that his illness was beyond their skills and
referred him for treatment to doctors outside the HMO.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at the City of Hope hospital in Duarte, Calif.,
recommended a bone-marrow transplant in October 1992 and the Aetna
doctors agreed, said Mike Bidart, Teresa Goodrich's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The standard for approval is 48 hours, but Aetna delayed for
six months until the cancer spread to his liver and it was too
late,'' Bidart said.
</P>
<P>
   David Simon, the chief legal officer of Aetna's managed care
subsidiary, Aetna U.S. Healthcare, said Wednesday night that the
HMO had acted promptly at all times, ``but when the question of
treatment was put to us, it was too late. It is unfortunate that
attorney Goodrich had terminal cancer, but we did nothing to hasten
his death.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Goodrich, the deceased's sister, said Wednesday night
that she was shocked by Simon's remarks. ``Aetna not only delayed,
but they admitted in court that they did not meet their own
standards for acting quickly,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Goodrich said that her brother died believing that his
chances of survival, while not good, were lost because of Aetna's
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Bidart, of the Shernoff, Bidart, Darras &AMP; Arkin law firm in
Claremont, Calif., said that Aetna had denied coverage on the
grounds that the bone-marrow treatment was experimental and thus
not covered, but that the insurance policy covering Goodrich had no
such exclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Simon said that the judge refused to allow Aetna to present
evidence showing that the treatment Goodrich and his doctors
proposed was excluded.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1995, when Goodrich was near death, he underwent
abdominal surgery at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, Calif.,
to relieve his pain. The next day Aetna hand-delivered a letter
denying payment for the surgery because it was done outside the HMO
network without advance approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aetna's position was that if you are disloyal, your benefits
are cut off,'' Bidart said.
</P>
<P>
   Simon said that the letter was required under California law and
was not a sign of callousness by the HMO.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the jury was never told that Goodrich had a second
insurance policy through his wife that covered his treatment. The
$775,000 in medical bills have since been paid by the two insurers,
another fact the jury was never told, Simon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an emotional verdict by an inflamed jury that we are
confident will be overturned when all of the evidence is heard by
dispassionate appellate judges,'' Simon said.
</P>
<P>
   Bidart had asked the jury to award about $32 million in punitive
damages, roughly the value of Aetna's surplus in California above
legally required reserves. Simon said the punitive damage award was
six times the California HMOs net worth.
</P>
<P>
   The largest previous award against an HMO, for $89 million in
April 1994, was returned by a jury in neighboring Riverside County,
also for refusing bone-marrow treatment. The patient, Nelene Fox,
died. Bidart said that case was later settled for a fraction of the
amount awarded.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Court, director of Consumers for Quality Care, a nonprofit
HMO watchdog group in Santa Monica, said the verdict was a message
to Congress as well as Aetna.
</P>
<P>
   ``Court cases like this are rare because most Americans, 125
million of them, cannot under federal law sue their HMO for bad
faith or denying treatment,'' he said. ``The jury was telling
Congress to pay attention to denial of rights that kill patients.''

`JUNK' GUNS HAVE L.A. COUNTY OFFICIALS TAKING AIM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUGLAS HABERMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Holding a cheaply made handgun, county Supervisor
Zev Yaroslavsky, joined by Sheriff Lee Baca, said barring gun
dealers from selling such weapons in unincorporated areas of Los
Angeles County would reduce crime.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a news conference Wednesday at the Beverly Hilton
Hotel, both officials denied that the proposed ban would
discriminate against people seeking inexpensive protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's discriminatory is people getting shot by two-bit
criminals carrying two-bit guns,'' Yaroslavsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Baca, ``The courts did not see this as being
discriminatory.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed ordinance is scheduled to be considered by the
county Board of Supervisors on Feb. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Three votes are needed for passage, and three of the five
supervisors -- Yaroslavsky, Gloria Molina and Yvonne Brathwaite
Burke -- support the ban. Supervisors Michael D. Antonovich and Don
Knabe oppose it.
</P>
<P>
   Courts have approved a similar ban adopted by the city of West
Hollywood. Last month, the state Supreme Court unanimously denied
review of an appeals court ruling that upheld the West Hollywood
ordinance, allowing the ban to remain in effect.
</P>
<P>
   Baca said a county ordinance would help deter gang violence, the
suppression of which he pledged to make his top priority as
sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am fed up with this carnage from gang members shooting each
other'' and killing innocent bystanders, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association opposes the ban, said Stephen
Helsley, a lobbyist for the group in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is absolutely a falsehood that people don't buy these guns
for protection,'' Helsley said. The proposed ordinance, he said, is
political buffoonery.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal lays out, in technical terms, the types of features
that make a firearm a ``junk gun'' whose sale by firearms dealers
would be prohibited. It specifies, for example, that parts of a
pistol or revolver must be made of heat-treated carbon steel,
forged alloy or other material of equal strength.
</P>
<P>
   Some handguns are so poorly made that they pose a danger to the
user, said Yaroslavsky, waving an unloaded pistol small enough to
hide in the palm of an adult's hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing won't protect you against an assailant,'' he said.
``You have as much chance of hurting yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guns, especially Saturday night specials, have been the
scourge of this county . . . for decades.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed law would affect only authorized gun dealers in the
unincorporated sections of the county. Yaroslavsky said there are
more than 100 such dealers.

   TULIKIVI-FIREPLACE (Bozeman, Mont.) _ The fire had burned down
to a heap of coals. With a gloved hand, Randy LaFerr opened the
oven door of his monumental Tulikivi soapstone fireplace from
Finland, and with a long-handle rake pushed the coals out the back
and into the stove below. The soapstone bricks that line the oven
were around 750 degrees, the perfect temperature, LaFerr said, to
start the hors d'oeuvres. He placed a plate of goat cheese and
cured olives with marinara sauce in the oven. In five minutes it
was bubbling gently behind the glass door. Tulikivi _ ``fire

PLUMMETING ROSTER `DEVASTATES' ASU DEPTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Arizona State basketball team is back in a familiar place.
</P>
<P>
   Gill Coliseum in Corvallis, Ore., which the Sun Devils visit
every year and where they play Oregon State tonight? Yes, but ASU
has returned to a more hostile environment, where the rough terrain
features academic difficulties and a reduced roster.
</P>
<P>
   ASU will be without swingman Derrick Davis tonight and probably
for the rest of the season, and might be without starting point
guard Alton Mason tonight. Both are junior college transfers who
have had a tough time adjusting to the classwork at ASU.
</P>
<P>
   Davis took courses during the recent intersession, but
apparently to no avail. The 6-foot-4 junior, who transferred from
Cowley County (Kan.) Community College, is on the brink of being
declared academically ineligible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a long shot,'' ASU Coach Rob Evans said of Davis
becoming eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Mason, who also took intersession courses, did not accompany the
team to Oregon on Thursday, but his prospects are brighter. He
might join the team today and play against Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may know something (today) or even next week,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   But Mason definitely won't play Saturday against Oregon, and not
because of academics. He has withstood a tragic array of personal
losses since transferring from Barton County (Kan.) Community
College. Two grandparents and an aunt have died since the school
year started in September, and last Thursday, Mason's father died
after a long illness. Even if he makes tonight's game, Mason will
fly back home to Nebraska for the funeral and miss the Oregon game.
</P>
<P>
   Showing steady improvement, Mason is averaging 7.7 points a game
with 71 assists. Davis is a valuable reserve, averaging 14.1
minutes a game.
</P>
<P>
   Without Mason, Evans said he will use senior Ron DuBois, a
former walk-on, along with freshman Kenny Crandall and junior Eddie
House at the point. The 5-foot-10 DuBois has played solidly if
unspectacularly in relief of Mason. Crandall and House have been
mainly wing players this year, although Crandall was a point guard
at Mesa Mountain View High School and House played a lot of point
during his freshman year.
</P>
<P>
   House suffered an injured knee and ribs in an auto accident last
week, but Evans expects him to play, and play well. But ASU's depth
will take a hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This absolutely devastates us with depth,'' Evans said.
``You're talking about a starting point guard, and a sixth or
seventh man. It really changes things for you. We were starting to
become a pretty good team. Now we go back to Square 1 somewhat.''
</P>
<P>
   Junior forward Okeme Oziwo, whose season has been marred by
ankle and knee injuries, will get more time, even though he isn't
at 100 percent efficiency. Evans believes he can contribute. But he
isn't so sure about juniors Jason Patton and Lohnnie Tape, who also
will play more.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they were the answer, they'd already be in there,'' Evans
said.
</P>
<P>
   Playing shorthanded is nothing new to the Sun Devils. Crandall
and Batiste started the season on the sidelines while attempting to
gain academic eligibility, and Oziwo missed nine games. Last year,
ASU ended up with just seven recruited players on scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to coach a little harder and get some wins,'' Evans
said. ``The bottom line is that nobody (else) really gives a
damn.''

COYOTES EXCELLING IN KILLER SITUATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
 KILL-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rob Murray, a guy who just set the American Hockey League's
all-time penalty-minute record, seems like the last guy you'd
expect to play a key role on one of the top-ranked penalty-killing
units in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   But with recent injuries to four of the Coyotes' top penalty
killers, the team had to turn elsewhere. Murray, a veteran
defensive-minded center who's made a career out of taking penalties
as well as killing them, is just one of many making the most of his
opportunity _ and keeping things in order.
</P>
<P>
   So what if he's spent most of his pro career trudging around the
minor leagues?
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys are out right now, and I've been asked to come in and
help out and I'll do whatever I can, whether it's on the penalty
kill or whatever,'' said Murray, who on the night of his promotion
from Springfield a week ago Saturday, surpassed Fred Glover's
50-year-old AHL penalty mark of 2,402 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Murray and other fill-ins, the Coyotes, entering
tonight's game at America West Arena against the Mighty Ducks of
Anaheim, own the second-best penalty-killing unit. They have
allowed just 22 goals in 181 total short-handed situations _ an
87.8 percent success rate. They barely trail the Buffalo Sabres,
who have allowed 26 power-play goals in 222 total chances (88.3
percent).
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix would have retained the No. 1 ranking, which it held
throughout most of the season, had St. Louis defenseman Al MacInnis
not slipped in a slap shot during the Coyotes' 4-2 win on Tuesday.
MacInnis snared it with one one-tenth of a second remaining in the
first period, on a disputed in-the-crease review, no less.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thankfully,'' said Murray, ``it didn't cost us.''
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully for the Coyotes, who have a four-day layoff after
tonight's game because of the All-Star break, neither have the
injuries to their regular penalty killers. Defenseman Gerald Diduck
(knee ligaments) and wing Mike Sullivan (broken rib) are out for at
least another three weeks. Two other key penalty killers, however,
centers Mike Stapleton (charley horse) and Bob Corkum (hip flexor),
are due back soon.
</P>
<P>
   Corkum is doubtful tonight, which explains the recall of center
Trevor Letowski from Springfield on Wednesday. But Stapleton said
he plans to play tonight against the Ducks, who had scored the
second-most power-play goals (43) behind Dallas (48).
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm ready to go,'' Stapleton said, ``but I've got
to say the guys who have stepped up have done a huge job.
Especially guys like Rob (Murray), not only for the penalty-killing
aspect of it, but for everything else he's doing. It's great to
see.''
</P>
<P>
   So is the play of other new penalty killers, including forward
Shane Doan, defenseman Oleg Tverdovsky, gritty forward Dallas Drake
and All-Star center Jeremy Roenick, who is back on short-handed
situations despite logging mega ice time as the team's No. 1
playmaker.
</P>
<P>
   The penalty-killing system is every bit as important as its
participants, however. Coach Jim Schoenfeld said he's used the
basic strategies of the format at previous coaching stops in
Washington, New Jersey and Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Never before has one of his teams finished first overall in the
league in penalty killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been the first guy off the bench (for penalty-killing
duty) in Springfield and I know what it's like,'' Murray said,
``but it's night and day compared to here. We've got a lot of youth
and inexperience down in Springfield. Here, we've got such skilled,
mobile defensemen who get things going. It's just a whole different
philosophy up here, a whole different system. And trust me, I've
been up here long enough to figure out how it works, and it works
good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks' star wings Teemu Selanne and Paul Kariya could make
dead ducks out of the Coyotes with too many man-advantage
situations. Along with center linemate Steven Rucchin, they had
combined for 17 power-play goals _ five shy of Phoenix's total. And
that was before their game Wednesday against New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to look at the personnel,'' Schoenfeld said,
describing his team's attack on the penalty kill. ``Anaheim, for
instance, is very dangerous with Kariya and Selanne. If Kariya's
playing the half-board position, he'll find Selanne in the slot. Or
vice versa. Selanne will find Kariya for the one-timer. They're
real good on the give and go. They're very good on the cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every team has its strength, but if you negate their strength,
they're not going to be as dangerous.'' &QL;

HONDAS LEAD FIELD INTO BOB  
 LUSK GRABS 2 WINS IN SUPERCROSS SERIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two races. Two Ezra Lusk wins.
</P>
<P>
   If Honda is intent on returning to the American Motorcyclist
Association Supercross Series podium, it couldn't have asked for a
better start.
</P>
<P>
   Honda riders swept the top four finishing positions in the 250cc
season opener two weeks ago at Anaheim, and Lusk leads Honda's Mike
LaRocco and Frenchman Mickael Pichon in the standings entering
Saturday's Round 3 at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Superstar Jeremy McGrath, who won four straight supercross
championships for Honda from 1993-96 and captured a fifth last
season for Team Chaparral Yamaha, might be in the best position to
challenge the Honda contingent.
</P>
<P>
   Although McGrath is No. 4 in the standings after last week's
runner-up finish to Lusk, it would be silly to discount the sport's
all-time leading rider. McGrath won seven of 16 races last season,
giving him 69 in his career, six more than Bob Hannah and Rick
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (McGrath) still has the desire,'' Team Yamaha Manager Keith
McCarty said. ``He's a guy that still can. I think he has his
sights set on another (championship).''
</P>
<P>
   Lusk has his eye on the same prize, which would be his first
after finishing runner-up last season to McGrath.
</P>
<P>
   Although McGrath was the preseason favorite to make it six
titles in the past seven seasons, it's been down one week and up
the next.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to an inadvertent collision with Kawasaki's Ricky
Carmichael, potentially the sport's next superstar, McGrath
finished seventh in the season opener.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last week at San Diego, McGrath and Lusk put on a
stupendous show, with Lusk rallying for the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``If neither one gets hurt, my guess is (Lusk) and (McGrath)
will be the two guys fighting for the championship,'' said
33-year-old rider John Dowd, who at age 32 last season became the
oldest 250cc supercross rider to win an event.
</P>
<P>
   Dowd may be right.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, however, Lusk has been bulletproof. Worse news
for the opposition is Lusk is the Valley's defending champion. But
that race was held at Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the main reasons we switched sites is (BOB) makes for a
more intimate setting,'' supercross spokesman Pat Schutte said.
``We're an outdoor sport, and to have a retractable roof means a
lot to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we run into foul weather, our dirt business quickly turns
into the mud business. That's not something we like.''
</P>
<P>
   What supercross officials do like are large crowds. Although the
63,565 in attendance two years ago at Sun Devil Stadium remains the
circuit's largest crowd of the 1990s _ last year's event attracted
50,225 _ Schutte expects BOB's estimated 50,000 capacity to be
close to a sellout.
</P>
<P>
   Among the expected 250cc entries are former Scottsdale resident
Jimmy Button, who now lives in Tuscany Hills, Calif., Ted Campbell
of Apache Junction, Robert Naughton of Flagstaff and Erik Anderson
of Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   Conspicuous by his absence will be Carmichael, who suffered a
gruesome leg injury in a crash last week and is expected to miss at
least two races.
</P>
<P>
   Carmichael, 19, suffered a deep puncture wound to his inner
right thigh, when he landed on the bike's foot peg and gouged some
flesh out of his leg, according to Kawasaki team manager Bruce
Stjernstrom. He also suffered a cracked pelvis.
</P>
<P>
   Carmichael, who last season became the first rider in series
history to win every 125cc race, could be out of action until the
Feb. 13 stop in Tampa Bay. &QL;

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA QUINTA, Calif. _ Michael Jordan has endorsed the Rockets'
acquisition of Scottie Pippen as a move that will bring more
championship banners to Houston, especially since Charles Barkley
now is set to go along for the ride.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley insisted Wednesday at the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic that
he would hold off on making a decision about which team he will
play for in the upcoming NBA season. However, several sources late
Wednesday said Barkley was preparing to sign a one-year contract
with the Rockets today, which would free the team to proceed with
other roster moves, including the acquisition of Pippen from
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets must get far enough under the salary cap to
accommodate Pippen's new salary, which will start at nearly $11
million. With Barkley signing for $1 million for this abbreviated
season, it will reduce his salary-cap slot by more than $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The signing of Barkley will allow the Rockets to consummate the
trade for Pippen, sending a draft pick and Roy Rogers to the Bulls.
That means the Rockets' new Big Three of Pippen, Barkley and Hakeem
Olajuwon will be in place for the start of training camp today,
although Barkley likely will remain in Southern California for the
next three days to continue playing in the pro-am portion of the
golf tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The Barkley-Olajuwon-Pippen triangle would make the Rockets the
preseason favorite for this year's NBA championship, Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just telling these guys how there's going to be three
more titles with Pippen in Houston,'' Jordan said in Barkley's
direction as the pair visited with galleryites and media members
during a lull in the tournament Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   To that, Barkley shot back: ``I don't have three years left in
this body. I don't even know if I have three months left.''
</P>
<P>
   It is uncertain how serious the threat was that Barkley might
have ended up somewhere other than Houston. The most likely
explanation is that his delay on Wednesday in announcing he was
ready to re-sign with the Rockets was simply because he did not
want to be taken away from the golf outing, which he, Jordan and
good friend Roy Green, the former NFL receiver, had been planning
for some time.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley said the lure of playing with Pippen and Olajuwon in the
same lineup is great. But he said there were other appealing
options as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting Scottie was a great pickup for the Rockets,'' Barkley
said. ``He's one of the greatest two or three players in the
league.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is more good news for the Rockets: Barkley is ready to
play basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley is about as close to buff as he can get with his stocky
frame. After ballooning to about 280 pounds, according to his
friends, soon after last season ended, Barkley has slimmed down and
is within a few Miller Lites of his playing weight, which is
advertised at 252 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in great shape,'' Barkley said. ``I've been working out
just to see if I could get myself in great shape and I feel really
good. I'm looking forward to playing this season.''
</P>
<P>
   So are the Rockets.

LEAFS WIN AS STARS CONTINUE STUPOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Fans last night at Reunion Arena found out just how
important defensemen Derian Hatcher and Richard Matvichuk are to
the fortunes of the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher and Matvichuk combined to have their worst performance
of the season, and there was no way for the Stars to overcome it.
Mix that with overall poor goaltending and a stunning performance
by Toronto Maple Leafs goalie Curtis Joseph and you have a 6-4
Maple Leafs' victory, sending the Stars into the All-Star Game
break with just a little bit to think about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Games like this frustrate you because it just wasted a great
effort,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``I thought this was the
best really since the undefeated streak that our forwards have
played.''
</P>
<P>
   But the defensemen _ specifically Hatcher and Matvichuk _ and
goalies didn't match that. Starter Roman Turek was pulled after
allowing three goals, and replacement Eddie Belfour was not much
better as he gave up a late goal to Steve Sullivan, thwarting a
strong Stars' comeback.
</P>
<P>
   And Hatcher and Matvichuk were on the ice for three of the goals
and in the penalty box for a fourth _ when they both took penalties
and handed the Maple Leafs a five-on-three power play with the
score 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   As strange as it sounds in a 6-4 game, the first Toronto goal
was the back-breaker. The Stars had played a near-perfect first
period and held a 1-0 lead, despite the heroics of Joseph, who
turned away countless scoring chances. But as the Stars were trying
to kill off the final seconds of the opening 20 minutes, Maple
Leafs winger Sergei Berezin showed up wide open on the blue line to
Hatcher's right.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Hatcher nor Matvichuk realized he was there and Berezin
slipped in to backhand a shot past Turek with 3.5 seconds left in
the first period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had played a perfect first period, it was their only
scoring chance,'' Hitchcock said. ``It sets you back emotionally.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock was actually very positive after the game, although he
did admit Hatcher and Matvichuk have been struggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, from the red line back, they have not been strong in
the last four or five games,'' Hitchcock said. ``A lot of it is
puck mistakes. That's the area, from their standpoint, that has to
get a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher and Matvichuk weren't alone, but being the Stars' top
two defensive defensemen, they carry the weight of the burden of
keeping goal-scoring down.
</P>
<P>
   While not speaking specifically about any defenseman, Stars
center Mike Modano said after the game, ``If we score four goals,
we should win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph allowed his team to take a lot of chances, and the Maple
Leafs cashed in with goals from six different players. Berezin had
a goal and two assists, as did defenseman Bryan Berard.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars received two goals from defenseman Darryl Sydor as
they tried to stage a frantic third-period rally. Sydor's second
goal made the score 5-4 with 10:05 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   But Sullivan scored, Joseph finished with 30 saves, and the
Maple Leafs moved to 26-16-3. After moving to the Eastern
Conference from the West this season, they are 15-2-1 against
Western teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars fell to 27-9-7 and take their longest slump _ 2-4-1 in
their past seven games _ into the six-day All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost the edge we had,'' center Guy Carbonneau said.
``Now, we have to take some time off and come back hard and get it
back.''

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Somewhere in Palm Springs, Calif., Charles Barkley will reach into
his golf bag and pull out an NBA contract today. And with that
somehow-fitting end to the NBA moratorium on signing free agents,
the Rockets' roster will fall into place.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barkley said again Wednesday he wanted to take the weekend to
consider his options, which he said he had narrowed to the Rockets,
Atlanta Hawks and Seattle SuperSonics. But the Rockets don't have
that kind of time, so Barkley will go ahead and re-sign with them
today.
</P>
<P>
   With the quirks of the new NBA collective-bargaining agreement,
the Rockets need Barkley to sign immediately so they can reduce the
$4.4 million he counts toward the salary cap to the $1 million he
said he would accept in a one-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   Once Barkley signs and the Rockets do a few steps of cap
dancing, the room will be cleared for the Bulls to sign Scottie
Pippen and then trade him to Houston. And with Pippen, Barkley,
their three signed players (Hakeem Olajuwon, Brent Price and
Rodrick Rhodes) and three rookies (Michael Dickerson, Cuttino
Mobley and Bryce Drew) all finally under contract, the Rockets will
fill their $30 million of cap space and begin signing four more of
their own free agents _ Othella Harrington, Matt Bullard, Matt
Maloney and Eddie Johnson _ as ``Bird exceptions.''
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds like a convoluted way to complete a roster, it
will be as it was drawn up in the second-floor war room in which
Rockets basketball management spent much of the six-month lockout
waiting for this afternoon's signing frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll say that when we sign everybody,'' Rockets coach Rudy
Tomjanovich said. ``But things are looking good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets will also add a pair of big men. Hawks free agent
Anthony ``Pig'' Miller arrived in Houston on Wednesday to sign with
the Rockets today. A 6-9, 255-pound fifth-year forward/center,
Miller was a frequent player in the Westside Tennis Club lockout
games and should add some inside strength to compensate for the
trade last spring of Kevin Willis and today's dealing of Roy Rogers
for Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in great condition; he's a worker; he's ready to rock and
roll,'' said Miller's agent, Charles Tucker, adding that his client
chose the Rockets over the Hawks and Magic. ``He should be able to
get a lot of time. He can run. He can back up both positions.
That's why I decided he's going to come there. I got a lot of
people mad at me in Atlanta, but I have to do what I feel is best
for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets will also bring in 7-1 center John Coker, giving
them 14 players under contract. Coker sat out last season after
aggravating a foot injury that had bothered him in two seasons of
limited action with the Suns. He averaged 12.3 points and 5.5
rebounds in four seasons at Boise State.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not a project,'' said Coker's agent, John Greig. ``The
talent is there right now. He's ready to contribute. People will be
very surprised when they see him. He's really changed a lot
physically since Phoenix. He's been playing outstanding up here (in
Seattle). He was killing (Jim) McIlvaine.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets' own free agents were also ready to sign Wednesday
and, with one exception, should be under contract in time to begin
training camp early this evening.
</P>
<P>
   That exception is Mario Elie, who was considering offers from
Utah, Miami and favorite San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Deals for Harrington, Bullard, Maloney and Johnson, however,
were all in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely confident Othella Harrington will remain a
Rocket next year and for a number of years,'' said Harrington's
agent, David Bauman. ``I'd be shocked if we didn't get that done
(today).''
</P>
<P>
   Bullard's agent, Herb Rudoy, said his client would sign a
three-year deal today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt will return to play for the Rockets for sure,'' Rudoy
said. ``Let's say we agreed to agree.''
</P>
<P>
   And though he would not announce the length of a contract until
today, Maloney's agent, Keith Glass, said the Rockets and the guard
have also reached an agreement on a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the lone free agent returning to the Rockets who was
not in town for the team physicals Wednesday, said he would be back
in time to sign today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a done deal, and I will sign (today),'' Johnson said.
``We took care of it, and I will be in there tomorrow. When you get
to a certain age, you want to be on a team with an opportunity to
win a championship and that caters to your strength. My only
disappointment is I didn't move to Houston, five, six years ago.''

COTTON ELIGIBLE FOR DIV. I
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOE STEVENS &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; Long Beach Press-Telegram &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   An unwanted chapter in the saga known as Schea Cotton's
basketball career closed on Wednesday when the NCAA deemed him
eligible to play Division I basketball.
</P>
<P>
   His reinstatement of eligibility comes after Cotton and his
family put pressure on the NCAA by filing a lawsuit against the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad it's finally over,'' Cotton said. ``Now, I can
focus on school, academically and athletically.''
</P>
<P>
   Cotton's eligibility was taken away after he passed the SAT on
his third attempt. He was taking the test with special
accommodations, no time limit and bigger print, because he was said
to suffer from a learning disability called test anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA deemed that the special accommodations were
unacceptable and made him ineligible for Division I basketball,
even though he nearly was enrolled at North Carolina State. After
the ruling, Cotton's family enlisted the legal services of the Long
Beach-based Rice and Rothenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Rice, Cotton's attorney, filed a lawsuit against the NCAA
in Sept. 1998. While Rice expected to win the lawsuit, he had
wished filing it were unnecessary. He added that the NCAA's
original ruling didn't make sense, considering that each time
Cotton took the test he had used the special accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected them to grant him his eligibility last spring,''
Rice said. `` ... Now, we're pleased that he has it back. It was
long overdo and a lengthy process to achieve it.''
</P>
<P>
   It could be that Cotton's roundabout past influenced the NCAA's
first ruling, deeming him ineligible. He signed an unprecedented
three letters of intent to play basketball at Long Beach State,
UCLA and N.C. State.
</P>
<P>
   He never ended up at any of the colleges. In high school, he
went from Mater Dei to St. Thomas More (Conn.) to St. John Bosco,
in which he graduated. Plus, rumors surfaced that there had been
NCAA violations when he was recruited.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these rumors and his many travels, Cotton said that when
all the facts are known, the NCAA's original ruling of
ineligibility is unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say they singled me out,'' Cotton said. ``But it's
important for the general public to see what happened and make up
their own opinion about the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Cotton, 20, is now leading Long Beach City College to an
undefeated record in junior-college basketball. He leads the South
Coast Conference with 26.8 points per game and has attracted NBA
scouts to LBCC's practices and games. He doesn't regret having to
enroll at the junior college and play under Coach Gary Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything happens for a reason,'' Cotton said. ``A lot of
good has happened from all of this. I got to play for Coach
Anderson and focus on basketball and academics again.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, upon hearing the news of the won lawsuit, was
ecstatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really been a great year, hasn't it?'' Anderson said.
``I'm proud of his family pursuing this and am proud of him. It's
very unusual for the NCAA to do what they did. Usually when they
take away eligibility, they'll keep it away for five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering the NCAA's ruling on Wednesday, it appears that
Cotton will transfer to a Division I school for next season.
However, the 6-foot-6 guard/forward said he is not ready to say
where he is interested in playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't even a recruit-able athlete until now, so I haven't
been thinking about it,'' Cotton said. ``Right now, I'm leaving my
options open.''

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
After an almost eight-month offseason, a six-month labor impasse,
and two weeks of painstaking haggling to translate a deal into
legalese, the NBA kicks into overdrive today.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The league needed half a year to come up with an agreement on
how to share its billions with its talent. Now, coaches and players
have 15 days to turn the past two weeks of telephone deal-making
into teams, beginning with today's start of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're only five, six, seven months behind,'' Rockets coach
Rudy Tomjanovich said.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of Scottie Pippen in the Chicago Bulls fire sale
might make on-court success more likely for the Rockets, but the
next two weeks won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   With Pippen, the Rockets are committed to their plan to ratchet
up the pace of their offense. Though they will continue to exploit
the inside strengths of Hakeem Olajuwon and Charles Barkley, there
will be changes in the half-court game to take advantage of the
newcomers added to the mix.
</P>
<P>
   The team got itself a few more days to put changes in place
before engaging in actual competition. The Rockets' exhibition game
with the San Antonio Spurs originally scheduled for Saturday has
been moved back to a 7:30 start Tuesday night at Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would have been a tough situation,'' Tomjanovich said.
``It was a little bit too soon with the conditioning factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Rockets, finally permitted to speak to players, had
them take physicals Wednesday and will begin signing contracts at 1
p.m. today. If all goes as expected, the Rockets will move on to
their first practice of the season this evening.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA schedule is expected to be completed by the end of the
week and is likely to begin Feb. 5. The Rockets had been scheduled
to visit the Lakers that night in the original schedule, indicating
the Great Western Forum would be available that night for a
national-television natural.
</P>
<P>
   The league got this far after agreements were finally reached on
the language of the collective-bargaining agreement and a dispute
over the duration of the ``middle-class exception'' to the salary
cap, which this season is worth $1.75 million. The sides agreed to
the union's contention that the exception remain in place
throughout the six years of the contract, rather than the three
years the owners wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it was coming soon,'' Tomjanovich said. ``In the
morning, we heard things had bogged down. Right after lunch, we
heard, `Get ready. You're probably going to do it tomorrow,' and
we've been scattering ever since. It's like a guy waiting in the
starting blocks, and the gun jams on the first one and then all of
a sudden goes off.''
</P>
<P>
   Once up and running, Tomjanovich will bring back two-a-days. But
he will have to balance the need to stuff a full training camp's
worth of conditioning, drills and scrimmages into roughly two weeks
without beating up the team too much. The season, after all, will
bring an average of four games per week.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he must address the need of adding to the Rockets'
system without sacrificing the basics.
</P>
<P>
   The training-camp balancing act will likely not be as unusual as
has been advertised since the end of the lockout. Though the threat
of injuries has been a constant issue as players rushed to get
ready in the two weeks since the lockout's end, coaches always must
weigh how hard and far to push players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always gauge how guys are feeling,'' Tomjanovich said. ``But
time is very valuable. I think I know how to evaluate a situation.
We want to get conditioning, but I don't want to wear guys out. The
time together and learning are the most important things. We're
going to have a good, tough training period, but also there's going
to be a lot of teaching. So it's not going to be full-blown
physical (work) for the whole duration of the practices. There's
going to be a lot of teaching the system.''
</P>
<P>
   While they bring rookies Michael Dickerson, Bryce Drew and
Cuttino Mobley up to speed on the old system, the Rockets will want
to add and test new wrinkles at a pace the veterans can handle.
They would like to get in as much as possible before the opener,
but the tinkering will likely continue into the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be affected by the lockout as much as anyone in
the league,'' Tomjanovich said. ``We want as much time as we can
get. We're probably not going to get it. We'll deal with that hand
and do the best we can.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to cut our stuff back to the core basics
and get a foundation we can work with. We don't even have our
schedule yet, so we don't know when we can plan ahead for a live
practice. We've got to get some things that are our meat and
potatoes and hopefully look for some breaks during the season to
add some parsley and carrots, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   With the trade for Pippen and rapid agreements with the bulk of
their own free agents, the ingredients would seem in place for the
Rockets. How quickly it all comes to a boil, especially with
rookies who will be expected to contribute and veterans who must
adapt to a new, albeit very pliable, talent, is the next question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they're going to be cramming a lot of stuff on us,''
Dickerson said. ``We're going to have to learn quickly.''

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THE Rockets strike a deal to bring Scottie Pippen to Houston, and
suddenly the air is heavy with championship aroma.
</P>
<P>
   But Hakeem Olajuwon smells something entirely different.
</P>
<P>
   Sharah.
</P>
<P>
   It is an oil made from the essence of flowers that he buys on
his annual trips to Saudi Arabia and uses frequently as a cologne.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1996 in Atlanta, it attracted the interest of several
other Olympians, and so Olajuwon became the unofficial perfumer of
the Dream Team. Gary Payton, Grant Hill and Pippen all took home
small vials of the oil along with their gold medals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since they could not buy it here, I told them I would give
them all refills whenever they ran out,'' Olajuwon said. ``Scottie
is the one who keeps coming back for more. During the last two
seasons, each time we would play the Bulls, I knew that before the
game he would send one of the ball boys into our locker room with
the empty bottle. So I guess he's hooked. I like his taste in
perfume.''
</P>
<P>
   Heaven nose, he also likes Pippen's basketball and the
intangibles he brings to the Rockets' table.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never knew Scottie until we made that TV commercial for
Visa,'' Olajuwon said. ``You know how sometimes you meet someone
and you know immediately that you like them? That's how it was with
Scottie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing the commercial, we laughed and joked, talked about the
game, and I enjoyed his personality. Then all through the Olympics,
I got to see the way he approaches basketball, and I liked him even
more. I'm talking about his work ethic in practice, his energy
level, how hard he plays all the time, and how much he wants to fit
in and become part of a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a short time that we were together, but a
friendship developed. I never thought about the idea of ever
playing together in the NBA, because I knew that I wasn't planning
on leaving Houston, and I thought he would play all of his career
in Chicago. To have him coming here now, to have this kind of
opportunity, it's exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   When you talk to Hakeem before the start of any season, you
learn never to expect anything except fierce determination and a
resolute belief that he will find a way to go the distance. Even in
those Dark Ages of the pre-title Rockets, when he was carrying half
the castoffs of Golden State on his back, he had hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never gone into any season when I did not think we were
a contender for a championship,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But this is different, not just pie-eyed optimism. His dark eyes
are as alive as Olajuwon himself spinning and moving down on the
baseline as he sits in the crowded restaurant, thinking out loud of
the possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen, with those long arms, playing suffocating defense in the
open court and using his height to make passes into the post.
Pippen along with rookie Michael Dickerson and Olajuwon running the
floor in the transition game, getting easy baskets.
</P>
<P>
   A waiter drops off a business card from a nearby table. On the
back is a note asking for another set of championship rings. Hakeem
grins.
</P>
<P>
   ``A championship isn't just talent,'' Olajuwon says. ``It is
chemistry, commitment and maturity, which we have. But it's not
guaranteed.''
</P>
<P>
   Not, he says, if the Rockets simply plug Pippen into the spot
vacated by Clyde Drexler and go back to their old pound-it-inside
ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a completely different system,'' he said. ``One that
takes the most advantage of Scottie's ability, his speed, his
versatility, and of mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon's ailing knees are strong, thanks to an offseason
conditioning program, and so, too, is his belief that he and team
owner Leslie Alexander are on the same page.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to give a lot of credit to Les and the coaching
staff,'' Olajuwon said, ``for their continuous efforts to go out
every year and get the best candidate available for our team.
They're not afraid to make moves. That takes vision and courage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with our injuries last year, we were the only team in the
West that could have beaten Utah. The lockout actually was a
benefit. It gave me time to get my health back. I've seen Charles
(Barkley), and he's in great shape. And we add Scottie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny. The last time we played the Bulls last year,
Scottie gave me his phone number, and we said we'd keep in touch.
When I went to Mecca over the summer, I was thinking about him, and
I bought him some of the oil he likes. A big bottle. I was planning
on giving it to him when we played them in November. Now, I guess,
we have a player who can help us win another championship, and I
have a welcome gift.''
</P>
<P>
   Together, they make perfect scents.

RECRUITS NARROW CHOICES  
 THURMAN, WADE LEAN TOWARD UA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Desert Vista tailback Bobby Wade and Avondale Westview receiver
Andrae Thurman, who call themselves a package deal, say they'll
likely play football at Arizona, although Wade added he may take a
trip to Washington this Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the family atmosphere there,'' Wade, the state's Big
School Player of the Year, said of Arizona, which he visited with
Thurman last weekend. ``You can tell it's real, unlike other
schools. As soon as you step on the campus, you can tell a
difference. These guys are very much together on and off the field.
It reminds me a lot of my high school team.''
</P>
<P>
   Wade said Wednesday he hasn't officially committed to the
Wildcats, although Thurman, who could soon be Wade's stepbrother,
seemed more ready to go out and buy red and blue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think (Wade) will decide to go (to Washington),''
Thurman said. ``I think he wants to stay in Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   Thurman said he was going to call other coaches this week to let
them know of his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next time I talk to (the Washington coaches), I'll tell
them that UA probably is going to be the best shot for me,''
Thurman said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Glendale Cactus All-Arizona outside linebacker Norman
Boebert, who grew up in the Valley rooting for Michigan, gave the
Wolverines an oral commitment Tuesday night and canceled a
scheduled trip to UA this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went up (to Michigan) this summer for their camp, and they
offered me then,'' said Boebert, who is 6-foot-5, 255 pounds and
runs 40 yards in 4.6 seconds. ``I got to know the D-line coach
(Brady Hoke) and the head coach (Lloyd Carr) and I trusted them
more than anyone else. Michigan has great tradition, and that's
something I want to be part of.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington Coach Rick Neuheisel is in hot pursuit of Wade and
Thurman, who made a pact that they'll play at the same school.
Wade's father dates Thurman's mother. The two players have been
best friends since junior high, when Wade lived in Avondale.
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel watched Thurman sink the game-winning shot in
Westview's basketball victory over Glendale Ironwood on Tuesday
night. After that, Neuheisel went to Wade's home and asked if a
trip for him to Seattle this weekend was possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked, `If I had to pick right now, who would it be?' ''
Wade said. ``I said Arizona. But I want to try to get up there (to
Washington).''
</P>
<P>
   Wade said he'll make his commitment official early next week. He
ran for 1,614 yards, had 720 receiving yards and scored a Class 5A
record 41 touchdowns. As a cornerback, he intercepted 12 passes.
And he scored the winning touchdown in three of the Thunder's four
state playoff games, leading his team to the title in only its
second year of varsity competition.
</P>
<P>
   Thurman caught 52 passes for 913 yards and 11 touchdowns and had
three interceptions, after picking off 13 passes his junior year.
</P>
<P>
   Wade said he hasn't yet ruled out ASU.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to make a decision that we can both benefit from,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In other recruiting news, North Canyon linebacker Alfred
Akinyemi and Trevor Browne defensive back Leondre Lewis, became the
third and fourth Valley players to commit to the University of
Nevada in Reno. Thunderbird tight end Jason Johnson and Avondale
Agua Fria offensive lineman Alan Parker also said they're headed to
the Wolfpack.
</P>
<P>

Quayle will file exploratory campaign papers today in Washingon,
and then make a public declaration on ``Larry King Live,'' the same
TV show that Ross Perot used to launch his presidential campaign.
Quayle discusses this and other things _ like his thinly-veiled jab
at George Bush _ in an interview with ``The Arizona Republic.'' By

KJ CONSIDERS ROCKETS AS POSSIBLE DESTINATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kevin Johnson and Charles Barkley together again?
</P>
<P>
   Don't rule it out.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Rockets apparently are among the front-runners to
sign KJ if he plays in this lockout-shortened season. But a KJ
friend who is fielding calls from NBA teams said, ``That's
definitely not a done deal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had some indirect conversations with the Rockets, but
there haven't been any further developments yet,'' said Kevin
Hiestand, who works for KJ's Kynship Enterprises. ``I know he's
interested in playing if it's a perfect situation and means having
a chance of winning a championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the acquisition of Scottie Pippen, Houston would be a
team that could compete for a championship.''
</P>
<P>
   By ``indirect contact,'' Hiestand said KJ had spoken with a
Houston player. KJ has a good relationship with former Suns guard
Eddie Johnson of the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   KJ, who acts as his own agent, had been rumored to be a
possibility for the Los Angeles Lakers and reports also have
surfaced that it's possible he would play for former Phoenix Coach
Paul Westphal in Seattle. The Lakers reportedly are prepared to
sign veteran point guard Derek Harper, meaning the SuperSonics and
Rockets are the most likely scenarios if KJ plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think at this point he's keeping all his options open,''
Hiestand said. ``Nothing has been ruled out.''
</P>
<P>
   KJ was on his way to Sacramento Wednesday, and Hiestand said he
probably will take 24 to 48 hours to make a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll wait to see if something makes perfectly good sense,''
he said. &QL;

LOSSES BRING OUT THE BEST IN BRUINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The UCLA Bruins have played poorly and they have
played well this season, and sometimes their performance changes
not by the game but by the minute.
</P>
<P>
   But in one aspect they have not wavered: The Bruins have played
their best games after losses. After losing to Maryland, they
played well against Kentucky. After losing to Oregon State _ their
worst game of the season _ they gave a taut, intense performance in
a critical victory at Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   And after a demoralizing finish against Stanford, the Bruins
played one of their best games of the season Wednesday at USC,
taking a 46-35 lead into the locker room and extending it to 20
early in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has to make us stronger,'' guard Baron Davis said Tuesday
afternoon. ``It's another point where we either fold or get
better.''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the Bruins played tough, physical defense, forcing the
Trojans into nine first-half turnovers. And although USC does not
defend like Stanford, the Bruins nevertheless executed their
half-court offense _ especially their zone offense _ with rarely
seen poise and precision.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Steve Lavin devoted nearly an hour of Tuesday's practice
to the zone offense, which failed the Bruins against Stanford.
Lavin emphasized spacing and ball movement, and in the first half
Wednesday, the Bruins did as designed.
</P>
<P>
   They used smooth-shooting forward Jerome Moiso at the foul line
to extend the defense. (If left uncovered, he will bury the
15-footer consistently.) More, they planted Davis on the baseline
and let him roam free in the soft seams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the half-court zone offense, all the (man-to-man)
universals carry over,'' Lavin said. ``You have ball movement, man
movement, flashing the gaps, hard cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   His heart's healthy: Sophomore guard Rico Hines, out 5-7 weeks
with a broken foot, has emerged as the Bruins' vocal leader. (Davis
and Earl Watson lead with their talent and performance.)
</P>
<P>
   Although he cannot contribute on the court, Hines plans to
maintain his verbal presence and will make the road trips to
Louisville and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have more effect in the locker room than on the court,
anyhow,'' he said. ``I'll help coach from the sidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   Do as they do: Stanford played defense Saturday night the way
UCLA wants to play defense: with its feet and its head, not its
arms and hands. There's a reason the Cardinal is holding teams to
36.8 percent shooting _ and doing it without excessive fouling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their defense is sound,'' Lavin said. ``They don't reach, they
don't lunge, and they don't foul a lot. They stay between their man
and the basket. It goes to fourth-grade, CYO principles.''
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers: The Bruins are 6-0 when scoring at least 80
points and 9-1 when outrebounding their opponent.
</P>
<P>
   How did UCLA rank in the Pacific-10 in the most important
statistical categories entering Wednesday's game?
</P>
<P>
   Shooting percentage: fourth (45.6).
</P>
<P>
   Defensive shooting percentage: fifth (40.7).
</P>
<P>
   Rebounding margin: fifth (plus-4.6).
</P>
<P>
   Turnover margin: second (plus-2.5).
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins rank last in free-throw percentage (60.6) and last in
3-point shooting percentage (27.4).
</P>
<P>
   In conference play, they're shooting 20.2 percent from 3-point
range.

QUAYLE TO ANNOUNCE PRESIDENTIAL BID TONIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former Vice President Dan Quayle tonight is expected to announce
plans to launch a Republican presidential primary campaign in 2000,
entering a crowded GOP race that could pit him against Arizona Sen.
John McCain and Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle said Wednesday that he will make a ``major political
announcement'' on CNN's ``Larry King Live'' this evening. He plans
to file papers next week establishing a presidential exploratory
committee that will allow him to begin raising funds and
campaigning in key primary states.
</P>
<P>
   In an extensive interview with ``The Arizona Republic,'' Quayle
vowed to present a different picture of the politician who once was
ridiculed in the media and lampooned by late-night comics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be different this time,'' he said. ``It's
different running for president than vice president. I'm in
control. It's my agenda, it's my staff, it's my campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll see the real Dan Quayle out there,'' he said, adding:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to underestimate the media's interest in going
back and rehashing a lot of the nonsense. That will probably
happen. But my focus is on going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle plans to step down as chairman of his political action
committee, Campaign America, to focus on the White House. The
Phoenix-based PAC has allowed him to travel the nation, campaigning
for GOP politicians and picking up support in key states.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle said he plans to make a formal announcement in April,
first in Indiana and then in Phoenix. He lives in Paradise Valley
with his wife, Marilyn.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to begin raising the $20 million necessary to run
in 2000 is forcing him to move up his timetable, Quayle said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the calendar, and every day that you miss is an
opportunity to raise money and get more support in Iowa and New
Hampshire,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle's fund-raising scramble became apparent this week in a
letter he sent to supporters attacking ``liberal Republicans'' and
the slogan, ``compassionate conservatism,'' that has been used
heavily by Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle and his campaign manager, Kyle McSlarrow, took strong
exception to a story in Wednesday's ``Arizona Republic'' that
suggested he was making veiled criticisms of Bush and of McCain.
His letter said he had ``had it up to here with Republican leaders
who are more interested in pleasing the ``New York'' ``Times'' and
appearing on ``Meet the Press'' than standing up for what is right
and the people they represent.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Quayle said he ``will not ever attack fellow
Republicans'' and said the news media are trying to create friction
between him and McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I say about John McCain publicly and privately has
been and will be positive, because I have nothing but positive
feelings toward him as a person and as a senator.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle, who was picked from political obscurity in 1988 to be
George Bush's running mate, skipped a run for the White House in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   He said this year's timing is right because two of his children
have graduated from college, and the third is a junior in college.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're what you call the proverbial empty-nesters. It makes a
lot of difference,'' he said. ``There's no pressure to go to their
basketball games, or their soccer games, or attend parent-teacher
conferences.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an entirely different family environment for me. That was
a major consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle's track record suggests he could overcome the pundits and
the political odds.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a powerful Indiana publishing family, Quayle first
ran for Congress in 1976, unseating a 16-year incumbent. After
serving two terms in the House, Quayle took on an institution in
the Senate, three-term incumbent Democrat Birch Bayh, and won with
55 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   He served eight years in the Senate, building a track record on
arms control, taxes and job training.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many believe Quayle still must overcome a lightweight image,
fueled by the media's constant repetition of his famous ``potatoe''
gaffe or the time he botched the United Negro College Fund slogan,
``A mind is a terrible thing to waste.'' Quayle said: ``What a
waste it is to lose one's mind, or not to have a mind.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, he caused a stir for his ``Murphy Brown'' speech, in
which he criticized the TV character for having a baby out of
wedlock. Yet even many liberals later applauded his strong position
on family values and the debate that it ignited.
</P>
<P>
   And his lightweight reputation was fought in a book by
``Washington Post'' reporters Bob Woodward and David Broder that
disputed the conventional media wisdom on Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Quayle is haunted by his gaffes, which appear on numerous
Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, he challenged the national media to follow him in
key early primary states.
</P>
<P>
   When reporters ``come with me in Iowa and New Hampshire and
start comparing me with others, I'm going to do very well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to re-engaging the media,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to focus on three key policy issues: combating an
``assault'' on middle-class values, foreign policy and economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe I am best qualified to deal with each one of those
issues,'' he said. ``On the values issues, I've been fighting for
the family and values ever since going into politics in 1976.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been there. I've taken the slings and arrows. You've got
to stand up for what you believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   He also cited his term as vice president in foreign policy, and
criticized the ``lack of moral authority we have in the Oval Office
today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take someone who know's what they're doing to
get elected,'' he said. ``No more on-the-job training.'
</P>
<P>
   And he said he plans to announce a major tax-reduction package
that he said would fuel growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people are yearning for right now is strong, honest
leadership. I believe I can give them that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also lashed out at Vice President Al Gore, the likely
Democratic front-runner in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   While they are the same age and generation, ``the similarities
stop there,'' Quayle said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most arrogant, most corrupt administration ever,
and Al Gore has been part and parcel of this administration. The
American people are going to want to change that. There's a lot of
things they will tolerate, but arrogance and corruption are not one
of them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle, 51, and his wife campaigned in 37 states last year for
GOP candidates through his Campaign America PAC. Quayle raised
millions, which allowed him to build support among Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle's move to Arizona, where he spent much of his childhood,
allows him to position himself as a Western candidate, although he
plans to formally kick off his campaign in Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, he has been teaching at the American Graduate School
of International Management in Glendale. He also is on the board of
directors of Central Newspapers Inc., which publishes ``The
Republic'' and two daily newspapers in Indianapolis, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning from Phoenix would allow him to be close to
cash-rich California, the biggest electoral prize in the states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being from Arizona is very helpful in getting to California,''
he said. ``The Republicans need to do a lot of spade work and
repair work in California. We got thumped this last go around.'' &QL;

LEHMAN AIMS FOR LA OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been a little over six weeks since Tom Lehman had surgery
on his right shoulder, the one he injured last summer in a freak
amusement-park accident before the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``My doctor and Doogie are really enthused,'' said Lehman,
referring to Dr. Lewis Yocum, his Los Angeles-based surgeon, and
Paul ``Doogie'' Hospenthal, his physical therapist from Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both feel like I'm doing really well, and that the shoulder is
coming along nicely. I'd say it's about 60 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   There's only one thing that would make the whole experience seem
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wish I was going to be ready in time for Phoenix,''
Lehman said of the Phoenix Open, which runs Jan. 28-31 at the TPC
of Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, I won't be. The doctor and Doogie both have
told me not to rock the boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, whose timetable for a return to the PGA Tour had been
targeted for Phoenix, now says he probably won't be back until late
February.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Nissan) LA Open would be a nice time to start,'' Lehman
said of the tournament that takes place Feb. 18-21.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman added that Hospenthal has given him the OK to begin
hitting 50- to 60-yard wedge shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't swung a club since the surgery, although I've been
working on my short game (putting),'' he said. ``Hopefully, that
part will be pretty sharp when I return.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman added that the worst of the ordeal has been sitting
around and waiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little bored,'' the Scottsdale pro said. ``And a little
disappointed about not getting to play here.''
</P>
<P>
   The reality, however, is that Lehman is extremely bummed that he
won't get a shot to win one of the tournaments he covets most.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah, I'd love to win one before the hometown fans,'' he
said. ``But you need to be strong to play the game, and my range of
motion is just not there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   So Lehman and his wife, Melissa, are taking their children and
``vamoosing'' to Mexico next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would drive me nuts to stay here and watch the tournament
updates each day,'' he said. ``There's just no way I could do
that.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Top teachers &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Golf Magazine recently released its annual list of ``Top 100
Teachers in America,'' and 13 from Arizona have earned the
distinction.
</P>
<P>

LaBauve of Kierland; Tim Mahoney of Talking Stick; Mike Malaska of
Superstition Mountain; Lynn Marriott of the Karsten Course at
Arizona State; Scott Sackett of Legend Trail and Resort Golf
Schools; and Paul Trittler of Grayhawk.
</P>

   Sackett and Trittler are among 10 instructors who joined the
list this year, while the others are repeats. &QL;

NORTHRIDGE RESIDENTS PROMISE FIGHT OVER STADIUM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ People who live near the proposed new 8,000-seat
football stadium at Cal State Northridge believe tonight's site
committee vote is a foregone conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-member site committee is scheduled to choose between a $1
million renovation project of Pierce College or a new $8 million
facility on the North Campus.
</P>
<P>
   A majority vote is needed to recommend a site. The neighboring
residential groups are bracing for an 8-3 or 9-2 vote in favor of
placing it on the North Campus. It would be approximately 75 yards
to the south of the current 7,500-seat football stadium, just north
of Lassen Street.
</P>
<P>
   Those opposing a new facility want to make one last stand before
organizing a lawsuit that would stop construction.
</P>
<P>
   The final meeting of the emotional process, which began in the
summer, is scheduled for 6:30 in the Grand Salon of the student
union.
</P>
<P>
   ``This leaves us to make some final statement,'' said Pat
LoPresti, a member of the Lindley West Coalition and wife of
committee member Bob LoPresti, a former CSUN baseball player.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to wait for the environmental impact report,'' Pat
LoPresti said. ``Once we document that, we can take it to the
courts.''
</P>
<P>
   Committee chairman David Honda, who does not hold a vote, said
the public would be allotted 30 minutes to speak before the vote is
taken.
</P>
<P>
   Residents from the Zelzah Coalition, the Northridge Townhome
Estate Homeowners, the Lindley West Coalition and the La Villa
Nueva Homeowners _ who combined claim a membership more than of
1,000 _ are providing vocal opposition in fear of what a new
stadium would do to the area. Those groups say the complex would
bring increased traffic, create a safety concern and be a nuisance
because of the noise.
</P>
<P>
   During the last meeting, CSUN campus architect Tom Tindall said
many of those concerns would be alleviated with landscape barriers.
Residents dismissed the natural barriers.
</P>
<P>
   Since that meeting, Alfred Mann, founder of seven electronics
and biomedical firms, asked for an additional four acres for his
planned MiniMed biotech facility. That land would surround the
stadium on three sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``The field will be buffered by buildings,'' Honda said after a
Tuesday meeting with CSUN president Blenda Wilson. ``You won't see
the lights and you won't hear the noise.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents are also worried the facility would also be used for
swap meets, rodeos, concerts and who knows what. The proposed
stadium also has an option to be expanded to 15,000 seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was just a football stadium, I would have a tough time
fighting that battle,'' said Jerry Lambert, co-founder of the
Zelzah Coalition. ``Blenda Wilson was not able to confirm that it
would only be for football.''
</P>
<P>
   Honda said a conference call with Pierce College representatives
is set for this morning, but since the school is searching for a
replacement to outgoing president Dr. E. Bing Inocencio, and since
it doesn't have a football coach, he didn't expect anything to
develop from it.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the intensity of the last site committee meeting _
which was filled with yelling and chanting _ Honda said several
committee members were not expected to attend. Instead, they'll
send in a write-in vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll have six to eight committee members in
attendance,'' Honda said. ``Business people thought it was so
(difficult) the last time, they don't want to go through it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   After the site committee's vote, Honda said he would need
approximately 30 days to write the recommendation to Wilson, which
would include notes and resident reaction from each of the nine
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The report will include a recommendation that a committee of
residents be established to discuss events that would take place in
the stadium, Honda said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with that is it'll be a committee that makes a
recommendation, but (Wilson) will have the final decision,''
Lambert said. ``If it's a committee of residents, all they have is
a recommendation to Blenda. I don't think it'll matter.''

 CAMP CREEK OFFERS CHALLENGE TO 4X4 VEHICLES, DRIVERS

 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sky was brilliantly blue, a gorgeous day in the desert. The
early morning had been nippy, but temperatures were climbing toward
the 70s.
</P>
<P>
   Even in an open Jeep, it was possible to shed some clothing and
be comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Fouts of Phoenix stared at the sky with admiration. ``When I
first saw that sky and the desert, I knew I wanted to live in
Arizona,'' Fouts said.
</P>
<P>
   That was in 1924 when Fouts was 8. He would have moved from
Indianapolis immediately, but his dad wouldn't let him. Fouts would
have to wait until he was too old to spank.
</P>
<P>
   Fouts, who will be 83 this spring, had decided to take a midweek
four-wheel-drive trip close to home. He would drive on Carefree
Highway to Bartlett Lake Road and head north toward the lake.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles down the road, he would encounter a huge sand wash.
Tire tracks in the sand headed in either direction from the
blacktop. This is Camp Creek, which is normally dry. It's also U.S.
Forest Service Road 413. That tells you how often the creek is dry.
</P>
<P>
   He would turn right and head south down the wash. It's an easy
drive for a 4x4, but the sand is loose and deep in places _ easy
for a two-wheel-drive vehicle to bury itself.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the weekend before, Fouts and companion Bill Atherton
had pulled out a two-wheel-drive pickup that was buried up to the
rear axle. The man had jacked up the truck and put rocks under the
tires, but it still wasn't moving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, that guy was really grateful,'' Fouts said. ``He walked
up afterward and put a twenty-dollar bill in my hand.''
</P>
<P>
   That was cheap enough for a custom towing job in the middle of
nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Fouts said he first made this trip in 1958. He was driving a
1957 International three-quarter-ton 4x4 pickup. That was a crude
truck by today's standards, but Fouts said it was one of the best
vehicles he ever owned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was easy to work on, had good ground clearance and had a
heavy-duty construction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This day he was driving a mid-70s CJ5 Jeep with front and rear
lockers. As usual, the old Jeep was piled so high with an amazing
assortment of gear that it was impossible to see out of the back.
There was everything from food rations, to camping gear, to tools _
even a toilet seat on legs. He has enough spare parts to fix almost
any minor mishap.
</P>
<P>
   The road winds its way about eight miles or so to the Verde
River. At that point a short stretch of blacktop along the river
joins Rio Verde Road north of Rio Verde. Drivers can continue south
and join the Beeline Highway or turn west back toward northern
Scottsdale by way of Reatta Pass.
</P>
<P>
   The scenery along Camp Creek isn't spectacular, but it's pretty.
Naturally, there are thick stands of vegetation and occasional rock
formations.
</P>
<P>
   This trip did turn spectacular when Fouts opted to go exploring
on a couple of side trails that he'd always wanted to take but
hadn't. Even after examining a topographical map, it was difficult
to locate the turnoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The first appeared to be a sand wash that joined Camp Creek from
the east. A sign with the 413 marking stands at the turnoff. A
single saguaro with no arms stands atop a hill next to the
intersection of the two washes.
</P>
<P>
   This trail wandered into some of the best stands of big saguaros
Fouts had seen. Some had eight or 10 arms. And they were thick.
</P>
<P>
   The trail began to narrow considerably and headed directly up a
steep hill. The Jeep climbed it without needing the front lockers,
but the trail was narrow with drop-offs to either side.
</P>
<P>
   After reaching the top, the panoramic view was excellent. Fouts
looked at the road going down the other side and had no idea what
he'd find except the steep ledge directly ahead. Since there was no
backup Jeep on this trip, he opted to turn around and go back.
Turning around on that narrow road proved a little difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Fouts liked the area so well that he decided he'd come back and
camp there in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was back to Camp Creek and a turn to the south. Not too
far from where the creek joins the river, rock cliffs rise along
another small wash that joins Camp Creek. Fouts again turned east
into this canyon.
</P>
<P>
   This drive turned out to be really exciting. The canyon walls
began pressing in on the trail. The passage got narrower and
narrower until Fouts almost wedged the Jeep between the walls. The
Jeep might have made it through if it hadn't had a five-gallon gas
can mounted on its side. The canyon walls would have claimed that
can.
</P>
<P>
   It was a beautiful place but not a beautiful situation. The was
no way to turn around. Fouts would have to back up about an eighth
of a mile or so along that winding trail and its unforgiving canyon
walls.
</P>
<P>
   It took some guidance and a lot of pulling forward and back
before the Jeep finally reached a spot where it could be turned.
</P>
<P>
   Camp Creek is used heavily by off-highway vehicles, so it's
necessary to be careful at the blind turns to avoid collisions. But
on this trip, Fouts encountered only one other vehicle _ two young
javelina hunters from Utah.
</P>
<P>
   It's not necessary to drive a million miles to experience good
four-wheel touring. And the desert at this time of year is a lovely
place to do it. &QL;

SUNS TURN ATTENTION TO GUGLIOTTA 
</HEADLINE>
 B-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With Antonio McDyess out of the picture, the Suns quickly turned
to Plan B _ a full-court pursuit of free-agent forward Tom
Gugliotta.
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta, a 6-foot-10 forward from the Minnesota Timberwolves,
became the No. 1 priority when McDyess stung Suns management with
his return to the Denver Nuggets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to be specific about any names, but we expect
to have some people on the horn, possibly in town, over the next
day or two,'' said Suns President Jerry Colangelo, who was
prohibited from identifying the free agents because of NBA lockout
prohibitions that are scheduled to expire today at noon.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns' interest in Gugliotta hasn't been a secret since late
last season, but it's not clear whether the feeling is mutual.
According to Suns sources, they were attempting to get him into
town today.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Colangelo referred to Gugliotta Wednesday night as the
third player in ``The Big Three'' free agents. The other two were
McDyess and Scottie Pippen. With McDyess in Denver and Pippen
headed for Houston, Gugliotta is the last domino standing.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Suns roster is in such disarray, they need an answer
quickly. If Gugliotta's interest appears to be in playing
elsewhere, the Suns would be left to divide up their available
salary and pick and choose from the free-agent leftovers _ which
might include their own Clifford Robinson, center Vlade Divac,
forward Jason Caffey and guard Brent Barry.
</P>
<P>
   It's been reported that Gugliotta was waiting on McDyess'
decision. After McDyess made his choice, speculation out of Denver
was that Gugliotta is leaning toward Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   There also was a report in Los Angeles that the Lakers were
trying to acquire Gugliotta in a sign-and-trade deal which would
send Elden Campbell, Eddie Jones and rookie Sam Jacobsen to the
Timberwolves. But Minnesota management dismissed the report,
because it says the deal's pieces would not fit under the cap.
</P>
<P>
   Cap restrictions could damage the Suns' chances at signing the
1998 NBA All-Star.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns best offer would appear to be six years for $52.8
million. Minnesota can offer a seven-year contract worth $87.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   There's a $1 million difference in the first year between each
offer, with Gugliotta getting $8 million from the Suns and $9
million from the Timberwolves.
</P>
<P>
   A potential advantage in the Suns offer is an option, an early
out, after the deal's fifth year. That would allow Gugliotta to
jump to a higher-salary tier in a system constructed by the new
agreement between owners and players.
</P>
<P>
   It also ensures a chance to shop for a new deal, if and when,
there are adjustments in the agreement. In an era of
rapidly-changing salary-cap restrictions, it provides some
flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   But there's little time to consider all the possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Timing is everything,'' said Suns Coach Danny Ainge, who will
not be able to open camp today because he will have only three
players, Jason Kidd, Danny Manning and Luc Longley, under contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns first move today will be the renouncing of their rights
to several of their own free agents, including guard Kevin Johnson
and center John ``Hot Rod'' Williams. The moves will give them $8
million under the cap.
</P>
<P>
   All of that will presumably be offered to Gugliotta. But here,
too, is a complication. Suns General Bryan Colangelo and Ainge said
Wednesday night that they want to re-sign Robinson, who had a
one-year contract for a $1 million exception to the cap.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns could offer him a 20 percent raise, $1.2 million,
without a hit to the cap. But Robinson wants a bigger deal. He was
attempting to get a five-year, $24 million from Detroit, but the
Pistons instead are expected to sign Loy Vaught and Christian
Laettner.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns are counting on the return of guard Rex Chapman, who
has said he will sign for the league average of $2.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   The timing question gets sticky if Gugliotta hesitates. If the
Suns wait and he stays in Minnesota, they could lose other players
who interest them. The option is to divide $8 million for next
season between a couple of younger players.
</P>
<P>
   If the option is youth, there are some possibilities under
discussion, namely Golden State's Caffey and Miami's Barry.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns also have a $1.75 million exception to the cap. They
have talked about veteran guard Terry Porter.
</P>
<P>
   Other considerations are veteran center Divac and forward Joe
Smith. Ainge said he is looking for a center and/or big forward to
go alongside Longley, whom the Suns will acquire today from Chicago
for Mark Bryant, Bubba Wells, Martin Muursepp and a conditional
draft pick. &QL;

DISSED BY DICE  
 MCDYESS RETURNS TO NUGGETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Antonio McDyess finally made up his mind. And his decision
wasn't what the Suns wanted to hear.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours after one of McDyess' agents fired several salvos at
Suns President Jerry Colangelo, McDyess spurned the Suns in favor
of the Denver Nuggets, who won 11 games last season and traded
McDyess to Phoenix in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know the real reason (he left),'' Suns Coach Danny
Ainge said. ``I've wracked my brain trying to figure out why he
wanted to go to Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been very strange, bizarre, not being able to
communicate. I'm not going to cry over this. We're going to move on
and try to do everything to get a good team. Hopefully, we'll be
looking at this in a few months and saying this is the best thing
that ever happened.''
</P>
<P>
   McDyess can get a maximum contract of about $67 million over six
years from the Nuggets. The Suns were dangling a seven-year
contract valued at $86.5 million. McDyess risks almost $20 million
in guaranteed money to return to the franchise where he started his
career.
</P>
<P>
   But he'll be back in Phoenix soon. The NBA regular season
schedule is expected to be announced today, and the Suns have been
told they'll host the Nuggets in their home opener.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, James Bryant _ who along with Houston-based
agent Tony Dutt represents McDyess _ accused Colangelo of breaking
rules of the NBA lockout by contacting McDyess on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He also denied a charge from Colangelo that he and Dutt have not
returned calls from the club.
</P>
<P>
   And he said Colangelo's critical comments about McDyess' agents
could push the player toward Denver.
</P>
<P>
   But Colangelo said he had a ``gut feeling'' a ``long, long time
ago'' that McDyess would not be back in a Phoenix uniform. At a
news conference Wednesday evening, Colangelo confirmed that he
talked with McDyess on Tuesday night before the NBA had cleared
teams to contact players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spoke to Antonio last night and had a very in-depth
conversation with him and was told by him that he would get back to
me by noon (Wednesday),'' Colangelo said. ``That did not happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm personally disappointed that it turned out the way it did.
He's a good young man. I think he's a guy of high character, and
he's made a decision to go to Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could analyze this until we're blue in the face regarding
the circumstances under which he left Denver, and his interest in
coming to Phoenix and his enthusiasm for doing so and the
experience he had in Phoenix his first year.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, as some have speculated, this is not about reasoning or
trying to figure out why. It just is. It just flat-out is, and so
we move on to other options.''
</P>
<P>
   McDyess was unavailable for comment Wednesday, one of his
representatives said.
</P>
<P>
   Through the last few weeks, the entire league has been on hold
awaiting decisions from the top free-agent players, including
McDyess, Scottie Pippen and the Suns' likely next target, forward
Tom Gugliotta. Pippen is headed to Houston in a trade, and the rest
of the free-agent signings are expected to fall into place once
Gugliotta reaches a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant called Colangelo's assertion that calls from the Suns had
not been returned an ``out-and-out mis-statement.''
</P>
<P>
   But Colangelo, General Manager Bryan Colangelo and Ainge all
said that even when contact was made with McDyess and his agents,
the Suns got little information.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant blasted Jerry Colangelo for attempting to ``strong-arm''
McDyess.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he thinks he can control the kid by berating him, or by
berating us, that's ridiculous,'' Bryant said. ``Maybe he just had
a bad day.''
</P>
<P>
   Rules of the lockout allowed clubs to negotiate with agents but
not have direct contact with players until Wednesday. Colangelo
expressed frustration Tuesday in not having access to McDyess
through Dutt and Bryant. Bryant said Colangelo called McDyess,
which would violate the lockout rule and probably would result in a
fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He talked to the kid,'' Bryant said. ``That's the report I got
from Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo said he wouldn't respond to Bryant's comments except
to say he did not ``berate the kid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been very frustrating over the last couple of weeks not
really knowing what's going on in his mind,'' Ainge said. ``The
most frustrating thing is, yes, there were returned phone calls,
but we got more information from (the media) and agents and other
(NBA) organizations than we did from Antonio's camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Ainge said he learned from others that McDyess apparently wasn't
happy with Ainge or his role in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that came out _ although when I talked to Antonio,
he didn't want to admit it _ was that he did not believe that I
thought he was a great player,'' Ainge said. ``A lot of that was
based on the fact he only played 30 minutes a game last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antonio had every opportunity to tell me that during the
course of the year. He never did.''
</P>
<P>
   Ainge said he talked often with McDyess about his role and how
he was playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``(I) never once had any inkling he was dissatisfied with his
role,'' he said. ``Sure, there are times when every player wishes
he was playing more. And I know he felt that, but when we had the
private conversations, it was all based on his wanting to play
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole coaching philosophy . . . the maximum (contract)
proposal, and our offense being designed around Jason Kidd and
Antonio is evidence of what we thought of Antonio and his
future.'' &QL;

SUNS PAY HEAVY PRICE FOR LOCKOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every war has its casualties, and here are the Suns, setting
when they should be rising, drifting off the horizon just when it
was time to break out the tanning oil.
</P>
<P>
   The lockout has killed the plan. The kid with springs in his
legs has left for the safety of losing in Denver. And you know
what? Good riddance. If Antonio McDyess doesn't care about winning
a championship, then maybe you can't win a championship with
Antonio McDyess.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the irony is thick and bitter because, of all the
owners, Jerry Colangelo didn't need this. He didn't need the new
collective bargaining agreement. He didn't need to fight the
owners' fight. He could've, in his words, ``lived happily ever
after'' with the old system.
</P>
<P>
   And so the owner who gains the least loses the most.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the saga of McDyess went from simmer to boil to
downright surreal. One of his agents claimed that Colangelo had
overreacted in questioning his client's logic, as if jumping from a
56-game winner in a swimsuit to an 11-game winner in snowshoes
makes perfect sense. One of them claimed Colangelo broke an NBA law
by contacting McDyess via telephone.
</P>
<P>
   It was spin control from a pair of vultures, agents who were
trying to deflect blame and criticism from McDyess. And themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns held a press conference out of disbelief on Wednesday
night, and while Colangelo held back the missiles, the anger beamed
from his eyes, turning his cheeks red. No, it doesn't make any
sense, turning down a winning team, a perfect climate, an
additional $18 million . . . unless you factor in the murky stuff. &QL; 
 &QL; 
McDyess drifts away
</P>
<P>
   Sometime this summer, McDyess drifted to Houston. He became best
friends with Nick Van Exel. He played basketball at the gymnasium
run by John Lucas, a newly hired assistant coach in Denver. He
fired Arn Tellem, the agent who helped broker a trade to Phoenix.
The agent who said, of course, McDyess would love a future in
Phoenix. He hired Tony Dutt, who happened to be Van Exel's agent.
And he started saying strange things, words that came down the
pipeline and landed in the ears of Suns Coach Danny Ainge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antonio did not believe I thought he was a great player,''
Ainge said.
</P>
<P>
   Because he had averaged only 30 minutes a game? Even though he
hadn't complained once during the regular season?
</P>
<P>
   ``They had to come up with something,'' Ainge said. ``I don't
think it's a vogue thing to say, `I want to be the man. I want to
score 20 points a game and win fewer games.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo is fuming because he's being played like a punk.
Months ago, he began hearing things. He smelled a scam in the air.
And you know what? All they had to do was tell him. Be honest with
a guy who has a book coming out in April. A book titled ``How You
Play the Game''.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they played hide-and-seek with McDyess. They were loose
in returning phone calls. And 24 hours ago, as everything came to a
head, Dutt changed the number on his cell phone. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Deck was stacked
</P>
<P>
   There are rumors to monitor, speculation that Dutt delivered
McDyess to Denver upon the promise that Van Exel will get a new
deal after the season. And there are little things, like the trade
the Nuggets made with Orlando for an obscure player, Keon Clark,
also a Dutt client.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a fair fight, we're going to win our share of battles,''
Colangelo said. ``But when the cards are stacked, when they're out
of your control . . .''
</P>
<P>
   That's all he would allow. Except one day, the principals in
this story will come full circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I have a long memory,'' Colangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two years, every decision revolved around this past
summer, the off-season when the Suns would buy their way into
championship clothing. They could've signed Scottie Pippen and Luc
Longley. They could've overwhelmed McDyess with dollar signs. They
would've been a contender.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they're stuck. Scrambling to fill a roster. Stung by an
apparent conflict of interests. Crippled by the fight. Unlikely
martyrs for the long-term health of the league. &QL;

BRUINS SHOW NO MERCY

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC's basketball team finally outdid its football
counterparts in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans have lost nine straight games to cross-town rival
UCLA, following Wednesday's 98-80 debacle at the Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   That's one more consecutive loss than the Trojans football team
has to the Bruins in this decade.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, USC seems on the verge of total collapse,
judging by the way the Trojans seemed to limp through most of the
contest. With seven of their final 11 games on the road, they might
be lucky to finish with a winning record.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the way they've looked lately, the Trojans might be
happy just to win another game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play smart at all. We didn't make good decisions,''
USC coach Henry Bibby said. ``We didn't do the things we needed to
do. It wasn't our night to win the basketball game.''
</P>
<P>
   USC (10-6, 2-5) picked up where it left off last Saturday in its
loss to California. The Trojans were utterly confused offensively,
with players not knowing if they should shoot or pass, and a
turnover often resulted.
</P>
<P>
   The loss completed a disastrous three-game homestand for the
Trojans, who lost to Stanford, California and UCLA. It also dropped
the Trojans to 1-4 at home in the Pacific-10 Conference.
</P>
<P>
   And to put it another way, the Trojans are 0-4 since Adam
Spanich's half-court shot at the buzzer defeated Oregon two weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Things were not nearly as dire for the Bruins (13-4, 5-2), who
breezed to another victory over the Trojans, and can now rest for
Saturday's contest at Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm most impressed with is the way we bounced back from
an emotional loss (to Stanford),'' UCLA coach Steve Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins still have a way to go before matching their longest
winning streak in the series. They won 18 straight from 1971-79.
</P>
<P>
   It was USC's most embarrassing loss at the Sports Arena in the
streak. The Trojans had never lost by more than nine points at home
to the Bruins during this current streak, and the 18-point loss was
USC's largest at home to UCLA since 1974, when the Trojans lost
82-52.
</P>
<P>
   Much like its football team, UCLA beat USC with offense.
</P>
<P>
   After building an 11-point halftime lead, the Bruins put the
game away with a 10-0 run to start the second half that gave them a
56-35 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The big player was freshman Ray Young, who had two impressive
dunks during the spurt and capped things with a 3-pointer that gave
UCLA a 59-37 lead.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the run was over, the only real entertainment left
was watching UCLA coach Steve Lavin's antics on the sideline, as he
jumped up and down every time the Bruins scored a basket.
</P>
<P>
   It was actually a competitive game early.
</P>
<P>
   After USC's Greg Lakey hit a short jumper to give the Trojans a
15-14 lead, the Bruins took over. UCLA went on a 15-2 run, as
Jerome Moiso made two jump shots, and Ryan Bailey, Young and Baron
Davis all hit 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   By the time USC called timeout, UCLA led 29-17 and rode the
advantage for the remainder of the half.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's outside shooting and rebounding were the difference in
the first half. The Bruins had 13 offensive rebounds, with Moiso
grabbing four, and outrebounded the Trojans 26-17.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA also made 6 of 11 shots from 3-point range, with JaRon Rush
a surprising 3 for 5. Rush led all scorers with 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   USC, meanwhile, was just 2 for 6 on 3-point shots.

DEVILS TOO HOT FOR DUCKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ The Mighty Ducks have depended on their goaltending
and special teams all season long _ perhaps too much if Wednesday's
game against the New Jersey Devils was any indication.
</P>
<P>
   With starting goalie Guy Hebert home in bed with the flu, backup
Dominic Roussel struggled as did Anaheim's vaunted power play in a
4-3 loss before 14,027 at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   Roussel had one goal bounce in off his glove, one deflect in off
his pads and another beat him from the blue line.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Ducks' third-ranked power play was 0 for 5
against the Devils' No. 20-ranked penalty unit.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim also gave up a power-play goal.
</P>
<P>
   After Roussel accidentally batted in Jason Arnott's knuckling
shot into his own net at 3:16 of the third period, Anaheim tied the
game 3-3 when Ted Drury's backhander banked in off of Martin
Brodeur at 6:05.
</P>
<P>
   But damage was fatal at 8:40 when the Devils' Vadim Sharifijanov
scored off a pass from Lyle Odelein after Teemu Selanne had been
pulled down and New Jersey broke out on a two-on-one.
</P>
<P>
   Just 39 seconds after the Devils had tied the game 1-1 early in
the second period, Steve Rucchin put the Ducks ahead 2-1 on pure
determination.
</P>
<P>
   Rucchin picked up his own rebound, played it off the back of the
New Jersey net, fell down, got up and still had the energy to stuff
a wraparound past Brodeur for his 14th goal of the year at 1:54.
</P>
<P>
   But the Devils tied the game again when when Petr Sykora scored
a fluke power-play goal at 13:27 while Matt Cullen was in the box
because of a questionable holding call.
</P>
<P>
   Sykora was behind the goal line when he attempted a centering
pass to Bobby Holik in front of the Ducks' net. The pass never made
it to New Jersey's leading scorer. Instead it deflected into the
net off the back of Roussel's pads.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils came within inches of taking the lead into the third
period, but Brian Rolston's shot from the right circle bounced off
the right post with 1:18 left in the second.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks took the early lead as quickly as Kariya could pick up
a loose puck in the neutral zone, skate down the left wing and fire
a shot that beat Brodeur from a steep angle at 3:05.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur certainly wasn't happy with that effort, but the New
Jersey goalie did stop Kariya twice and Rucchin once midway through
the opening period when Anaheim's top line was swarming the New
Jersey net.
</P>
<P>
   It was Roussel's turn to give up a bad goal at 1:15 of the
second period when New Jersey defenseman Scott Stevens beat the
Anaheim goalie on the glove side from 55 feet out.
</P>
<P>
   Coming into the game, Roussel was 2-3-1 with a 2.23
goals-against average and .933 save percentage, but he was pulled
in the first period of a Jan. 10 game versus Edmonton that the
Ducks rallied to win 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   As unhappy as coach Craig Hartsburg was about his team's defense
late in Monday's 5-3 win over Pittsburgh, the Ducks have
dramatically improved their defense. They allowed 3.18 goals a game
last season, while scoring only 2.5. This season, they were scoring
only 2.48 goals a game heading into Wednesday's game, but were
allowing only 2.35.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, New Jersey, long one of the NHL's most
defensive-minded teams, has opened things up under new coach Robbie
Ftorek. The Devils came into the game allowing 2.64 goals a game
this season. Last year they gave up only 2.02 a game. Offensively
they were averaging 2.90 goal a game, compared to 2.74 last year.

NORTHRIDGE PARLAYS MEETING INTO VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Cal State Northridge needed a leader. Not on the
court, but in the locker room, somewhere away from the gym.
</P>
<P>
   Derrick Higgins, the Matadors' lone senior, was the only one
qualified to be such a person.
</P>
<P>
   So he called a team meeting four days ago. Now, the Matadors
appear emotionally closer.
</P>
<P>
   And, according the Higgins, it's the reason they didn't crack
after lowly Sacramento State rallied from a 20-point deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Matadors countered with a defining spurt and sent
the Hornets to an 84-68 defeat Wednesday. It was their 32nd
straight loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not opposed (to meetings) at all,'' CSUN coach Bobby
Braswell said. ``I think there's times players have to show
leadership. Sometimes coaches have said everything they can say.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN (11-8, 3-4 Big Sky) stabilized its standing in the middle
of the conference, but could take a significant step toward
regaining respect in the league tonight when it hosts Weber State.
</P>
<P>
   What remains to be seen is whether junior guard Greg Minor is on
the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Minor, CSUN's best outside shooter and backup point
guard, nor reserve forward Jermar Welch were in attendance against
the Hornets. Both were home with the flu.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing that did work out for the Matadors was the
extended playing time Markus Carr received because of Minor's
absence. He took just one shot and had five points, but had a
career-high 13 assists, the third best total in CSUN history. He
played all but two minutes of the second half as Jason Crowe sat
the bench _ a coach's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second half he didn't have a lot of rest and he played
well, and I was just very pleased with him,'' Braswell said of
Carr. ``He's just a freshman, and this team is very young. I know
the expectations are big, but this team is young. We have one
senior on this team and six guys in their first year.''
</P>
<P>
   Higgins was the perfect guy to ask the coaches whether a
players'-only meeting was acceptable, and the only one with the
experience and savvy to know to do it.
</P>
<P>
   He's a sixth-year senior, in his fourth year at CSUN. And he's
also playing the best basketball of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins scored 20 points against the Hornets (0-15, 0-5), which
is comparable to what he's done since the Big Sky season began. But
he also hustled back on defense, blocked a few shots and made a
couple of nifty passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main focus (of the meeting) was that we have to make a
run,'' Higgins said. ``Some have said we're the most talented team
in the Big Sky. That's what they say. This was a reality check.''
</P>
<P>
   However, while the crux of Higgins' message was received by the
Matadors, another major portion remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Against a team that hasn't won in 13 months, not to mention one
playing on the road, the Matadors let a huge lead slip away. It
happened in the four-point win Sunday at Montana, which took place
a few hours after the aforementioned team meeting, and it
resurfaced again.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento State was so bad at the outset that CSUN had nine
points before the Hornets attempted a shot. At that same juncture,
Sacramento State got the ball past half court once.
</P>
<P>
   And the first three minutes produced five CSUN dunks and a 13-3
lead. And the Matadors extended that lead to 41-21 before the
Hornets cut the lead to 48-42 at the half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not being big-headed, but we knew we were going to pull it
out,'' Higgins said. ``We have to keep our focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento State pulled within 61-60 with 10:22 to play before
CSUN made its final run. Carl Holmes triggered it with a 3-pointer
and it ended on a free throw by Andre Larry, which gave CSUN an
80-62 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to maintain our focus,'' Carr said. ``When that happens
we have to get back on it, get our pressure back up. We bounced
back.''

FOX WILL STAY WITH LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Lockout limbo finally gave way to business as
usual in the NBA on Wednesday, and the Lakers wasted no time
putting the new labor agreement to use, re-signing free agent Rick
Fox.
</P>
<P>
   In the chaotic, post-lockout climate, the NBA's rules are still
sketchy, so contract terms are uncertain, and the deal may not even
be complete in time for Fox to participate in the opening of
training camp this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   All that's certain is he's staying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can confirm that Rick is returning to Los Angeles,'' Doug
Johnson, Fox's agent, told the Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   Details were still being worked out, and the deal cannot become
official until 11 a.m. today, when the NBA lifts the moratorium on
trades and signings. The Lakers will sign Fox using the new
middle-class exception, signing him for $1.75 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's good news if it turns out that way,'' coach Del Harris
said of Fox's return. ``He's a good, hard, tough player and a team
player. Keeping him and adding Derek Harper certainly will help us
in the toughness area.''
</P>
<P>
   Lakers executive Jerry West confirmed Fox's desire to stay but
said no deal has been consummated. West had yet to see a draft of
the NBA's new labor deal, signed Wednesday afternoon in New York,
making it difficult to nail down a contract for Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anything's official until you get to a certain
point in time,'' West cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   A seven-year veteran, Fox averaged 12 points, 4.4 rebounds and
3.4 assists as the Lakers' starting small forward last season. More
importantly, he brought maturity, intensity and a hard-nosed style
to a young team in need of all those elements.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is obviously someone we covet here, and we just think he is
a really good ballplayer, a tough-minded guy who really wants to
win,'' West said. ``He's one of the greatest people I've ever been
around. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to do what we can for him and try to keep him a Laker
until he wants to retire.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new labor deal, a team can offer one player the
middle-class exception, covering up to six years. More likely, Fox
will sign for one or two years to earn his Larry Bird rights or
``early Bird'' rights, then be eligible to re-sign for $3 million
or more.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, New York and Seattle all offered Fox similar deals and
at least one, unidentified team offered more money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough decision for him,'' said Fox representative
Mark Portnoy. ``But he loves L.A., he has great respect for the
management and ownership, he really likes his teammates and wants
to win a championship. He feels this is the best place to win
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, West confirmed that Harper, who agreed this week
to join the Lakers, will sign for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the latest trade rumor had the Lakers dealing Elden
Campbell, Eddie Jones and Sam Jacobson to Minnesota for Tom
Gugliotta. Jacobson's agent said the rookie isn't involved, while
sources close to the team scoffed at the rumor and indicated the
Lakers could obtain Gugliotta in a one-for-one deal.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, absent the last five days of voluntary workouts,
rejoined the team Wednesday and is expected to be at training camp
at UC Santa Barbara this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers open camp with 14 players under contract or otherwise
committed, and practices will run through Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   After several delays by the NBA this week, players were just
happy to get camp under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big relief,'' Robert Horry said. ``A lot of guys didn't
know what we were going to be doing. It's fun to start.''

EX-BYU RUNNING BACK TALKS TO NORTHRIDGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Former Brigham Young running back Ronney Jenkins,
who was granted a withdrawl last month after a second violation of
the school's code of honor, visited with Cal State Northridge
coaches earlier in the week, his uncle, Duke Hall, said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said he and Jenkins, a Hueneme High of Oxnard graduate,
wouldn't comment on the possibility of Jenkins enrolling at CSUN.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to Jenkins said Northern Arizona, Southern Utah
and South Florida are also interested in him. Also, Jenkins has had
several scholarship offers from Division I-A schools.
</P>
<P>
   If Jenkins _ who has two years of eligibility remaining _
transferred to a Division I-A school he would be forced to sit out
a year. Since he already redshirted a season, he would lose a year
of eligibility. Division I-AA rules do not prohibit a transfer from
playing immediately.
</P>
<P>
   A 5-foot-11, 170-pounder, Jenkins led the Western Athletic
Conference in rushing with 1,307 yards in 13 games last season. He
averaged 5.2 yards per carry, caught 34 passes for 349 yards and
scored 15 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins rushed for 733 yards and 11 touchdowns as a freshman in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Salt Lake Tribune, Jenkins allegedly committed
a sexual transgression of the school's code, which includes
prohibitions on premarital sex.
</P>
<P>
   Sources in Utah also said BYU freshman wide receiver Mike
Rigell, who led the WAC in kickoff returns with a 26.8 average, has
expressed interest in transferring to CSUN.
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano turns down WAC offer: One season of success at CSUN
caught the attention of some schools, particularly one in the
Western Athletic Conference. Ponciano, who went 7-4 in his first
season with the Matadors, said he recently turned down an offer to
be an assistant coach at a WAC school to remain with the Matadors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the kids,'' said Ponciano, who is fighting a low budget.
``I can't let my feelings get in the way of it. I have to be
unselfish. The kids, you look at the good things that are happening
here and what they're doing. There's unfinished business here.''
</P>
<P>
   Before being named Matadors coach a year ago, Ponciano was an
assistant at San Jose State.
</P>
<P>
   Pair from Highland commit: Running back Brandon McElvaine and
defensive lineman Edwin Reed, both seniors at Highland High, gave
oral commitments to attend CSUN next year.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-1, 205-pound McElvaine ran for 1,159 yards and 10
touchdowns for the Bulldogs. He was also being recruited by Fresno
State and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, but what pushed him toward the
Matadors was the quarterback. McElvaine used to live in San Diego
and played on the same baseball team as Marcus Brady.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's another plus, and he's a heckuva an athlete,''
McElvaine said. ``I think their program is on the way up. It looks
like they're getting a new stadium and I want to be one of the
first people to play in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed and McElvaine decided together to attend CSUN. Reed, who
doubled as a fullback for the Bulldogs (3-8), is just happy to
continue his football career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year I didn't get much playing time and I didn't think I
was going to play this year, but the coaches gave me a second
chance,'' said the 6-3, 240-pound Reed. ``I had an attitude last
year. I wasn't a good sport. I wasn't the best player. I changed
that this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed was also being recruited by Utah State, Cal Lutheran and
Sacramento State.

NANCY WILSON LEAVES SISTER HOME, ALONG WITH ELECTRONICS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANN POWERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``I used to do this a long time ago, when I was in
college,'' said Nancy Wilson _ the rock guitarist, not the jazz
singer _ as she strummed an acoustic guitar on a stage adorned with
roses at the Fez on Tuesday night. ``Then I joined the Army and saw
the world a few times.''
</P>
<P>
   She laughed, communicating the congeniality that tempers the
fierce warrior-princess persona she projects when tossing off
pop-metal riffs in Heart. That band, which endures today but hit
its high points in the 1970s, not only took Ms. Wilson and her
singing sister, Ann, around the world; it also made icons of them
as they recast rock's romantic machismo as an expression of
traditional feminine desires.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the wailing hard-rock vocals and two-guitar assaults,
Heart wove in daintier elements borrowed from coffeehouse
singer-songwriters, creating a sound that rendered the sisters'
fairy tale-flavored musings on romance full-blooded instead of
merely girlish. At the Fez promoting a soon-to-be-released solo
acoustic album, Ms. Wilson traced the origins of that sound in a
solo set that blended Joni Mitchell-style introspection with
fervent singing and strumming indebted to Led Zeppelin.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wilson honored her pop-folk influences with cover versions
of songs by Ms. Mitchell, Paul Simon and Elton John; she nodded to
progressive rock (and to her husband, the director Cameron Crowe,
who used the song in his film ``Say Anything'') by performing Peter
Gabriel's ``In Your Eyes.'' For much of her hourlong late-night
set, however, she focused on originals.
</P>
<P>
   As with Heart's hits, her songs celebrated life's emotional
passages in the language of goddess worship and Arthurian romance.
Her lyrics ran thick with images of ocean and fire, candles and
stained glass, princes and forests green. Just when the incense of
the ages began to overwhelm, Ms. Wilson would throw in a casual
phrase, as if to imply that she's just your average modern-day
pagan, finding magic at the kitchen table.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wilson's accessibility was her greatest charm, apparent in
the warmth of her singing (close in tone to her sister's, although
not quite as vivid), her joking manner and even her playing, which
was expert but not grandstanding, despite the years she has spent
in the company of self-styled fretboard gods. She is approaching
her solo career, a new passage in her life, with modesty and good
humor. Her attitude befits a star whose music has always captured
the dreams of normal girls.

(THEATER REVIEW: THREE SISTERS WITH JEALOUSIES, RIVALRIES AND
REGRETS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three mature women sit in a proper British parlor.
Their posture is prim, their clothes tweedy and buttoned up. They
are discussing the prospect of hiring a ``girl Friday.'' Soon a
white-haired man in a morning coat joins them, having just returned
from a funeral.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the entertainment to be? Are the old folks going to
poison unsuspecting boarders? Make fools of themselves fawning over
the new girl? Cause some difficulty by showing signs of senility?
No. ``The Understanding,'' a smart, charming, quietly eloquent
play, is a love story, a romantic triangle (with a hint of a
quadrangle), and no one involved looks even remotely foolish.
</P>
<P>
   The three women _ grumpy Lydia (Mary Fogarty), take-charge Eva
(Elizabeth Parrish) and quiet Acton (Catherine Wolf) _ are sisters,
as the audience soon learns. The man, Leonard (William Cain), is
Eva's husband.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, though, he seems to talk most about Acton. It's her tiny
waist he remembers from the days of their youth. It's how old she
was when he met all three sisters that he recalls. When Kate (Nile
Lanning), the 18-year-old girl Friday, moves in, it is Acton's
copper hair that hers reminds him of. &UR;  &LR;  Whenever Leonard and Acton
are alone in the parlor, it's clear that there's something strong
and magical and deeply respectful between them. That's a
combination you don't see much of in fiction these days.
</P>
<P>
   The playwright, Angela Huth (whose novel, ``Land Girls,'' was
turned into a 1998 film), has created intelligent characters who
have resonant emotional lives and speak in full, thoughtful
sentences, especially Eva. `` &UR;  &LR;  Forced to remember for a single
hour,'' Eva says of those who have attended a funeral, ``people
come out feeling much better.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never the right evening for hard truths,'' she tells
Leonard when, having decided that she is about to die, she wants at
least to acknowledge their marriage's shortcomings, if not the most
likely reason for them.
</P>
<P>
   There are jealousies, rivalries, second thoughts and regrets.
Apparently the bafflement that the sexes feel about ech other
continues in the twilight years, even among articulate English
people, even those who live in 12-room houses (not counting
bathrooms and servants' quarters). &UR;  &LR;  ``Women have such a strange
need for declarations, don't they?'' Leonard says at one point. And
believe it or not, male fear of commitment wasn't invented by baby
boomers or Generation X. In the second act, when Leonard is free to
do anything he wants, he says to Acton, ``I must ask you to be
patient just a little while longer.''  &UR;  &LR;  The play's ending is a bit
idealistic but still plausible, and the very talented cast's many
decades of experience give the actors a collective sureness that
can stand up to manic youthful energy any day.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Meyer's scenic design, with Kate's artistic paper trees as
its focus, conveys just the resistance to and acceptance of change
that it should. And Greg Poplyk's costumes manage to be tasteful
and character-appropriate while making all kinds of nonverbal
statements. Take Kate's vintage dress near the end of Act II and
the color-coordinated wardrobes. In one scene, set in fall, all the
characters on stage are dressed in the shades of autumn leaves. In
another, they're all in shades of gray.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Understanding,'' brightly and expertly directed by Elowyn
Castle, continues at the Neighborhood Playhouse through Jan. 31.

   FED CHIEF SUPPORTS AID FOR SOCIAL SECURITY
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, told the
House Ways and Means Committee he supports the president's notion
of putting almost two-thirds of the Federal budget surpluses over
the next 15 years into Social Security reserves.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenspan and some Republicans in Congress disagreed with
the president's idea of having the government invest part of the
money in the stock market. Political pressures, Greenspan said,
could lead to inefficient investments that would result in a lower
rate of return for retirees and a lower standard of living for
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's proposal to shore up the Social Security
System by investing some money in the stock market disagrees with a
Republican plan to turn revenue over to individuals for their own
investment accounts.
</P>
<P>
   INFLATION POLICY AT RISK IN ISRAEL
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has rattled some
market analysts and political rivals by saying that he may abandon
long-stated quests to slow inflation to 4 percent this year and cut
the nation's budget deficit to 2 percent of the gross domestic
product.
</P>
<P>
   PROFIT UP AT TEXAS INSTRUMENTS
</P>
<P>
   A slimmed-down Texas Instruments reported better-than-expected
fourth-quarter earnings. Analysts said the company's moves out of
memory chips, computers and defense, combined with its
concentration on more specialized products like digital signal
processors and analog chips, had begun to pay off with higher
profit margins and more consistent earnings growth. Shares of Texas
Instruments rose $6.625, to $99.625.
</P>
<P>
   AMERICAN AIRLINES and US AIRWAYS posted disappointing quarterly
earnings on weaker-than-expected revenues, while America West
Airlines exceeded Wall Street estimates.
</P>
<P>
   GENERAL ELECTRIC said its fourth-quarter profit rose 14 percent
as the company sold more industrial service contracts.
</P>
<P>
   BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB said its fourth-quarter profit rose 13
percent.
</P>
<P>
   REPORT SUGGESTS CONTINUED GROWTH
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve's latest reading on the nation's economy,
the regional outlook known as the beige book, suggests the current
expansion, already at a peacetime record, will persevere in 1999
while inflation remains at bay. In a separate report, the Commerce
Department said housing starts rose in December to an almost
12-year high.
</P>
<P>
   STOCKS START OUT STRONG BUT FADE
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices marched higher Wednesday morning but then faded in
the final hour or so and ended mixed. The Dow Jones industrial
average fell 19.31 points, to 9,335.91. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index rose 4.62 points, to 1,256.62. The Nasdaq composite
index edged up 7.32 points, to 2,415.49, its second consecutive
record. In the bond market, Treasury prices fell as the yield of
the 30-year issue rose to 5.17 percent from 5.14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   E-MAIL PRESENTED AT MICROSOFT TRIAL
</P>
<P>
   The government presented documents and e-mail in Microsoft's
antitrust trial as evidence for its contention that the software
giant had imposed contract restrictions on computer makers to
thwart competition.
</P>
<P>
   A RECORD SUM FOR SUPER BOWL ADS
</P>
<P>
   Anheuser-Busch is spending a record sum for nine spots during 5
minutes and 15 seconds of commercial time during the Super Bowl on
Jan. 31, the most by far for any advertiser. The spots will
probably mark the beginning of the end for the popular Budweiser
beer campaign about talking frogs and lizards, executives said.

MY BRIEF, WEIRD LIFE AS A STAND-UP COMIC  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 24)
</HEADLINE>
 (af) 
By NEIL STRAUSS  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There's only one thing more humiliating than being a
stand-up comic. And that's trying to be a stand-up comic. That's
the lesson I learned after six months trying to make it as a
comedian.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Jerry Seinfeld, Rosie O'Donnell or any successful stand-up:
the bottom rung of the comedy ladder can be uglier, crueler and
more demeaning than in any other line of entertainment _ be it
actor, model, musician, writer or clown. Sexism and racism run
rampant, club-owners ask struggling comedians to scrape gum off the
bottom of tables to get a booking, competition between comics is
fierce, and newcomers have to pay to perform. For comedy clubs,
aspiring comedians aren't a source of new talent: they're extra
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   If you ever talked to comedians off-stage, you'll see the scars
trying to make it has left on them: they are bitter and humorless.
If you can't see those scars, then chances are they're still doing
a routine for you. Yet, somehow, hundreds of comics persist in
trying to make it in every major city: cops and businesswomen,
housewives and senior citizens, students and Rastafarians, all
doing as many as nine pay-to-play shows a week.
</P>
<P>
   Within this group of mistreated misfits are the next Seinfelds
and Rosie O'Donnells _ if they can survive the years of rebuke.
This is the story of one stage-shy journalist who told his editors
he was going underground to write an expose on open-mike stand-up
comedy in Manhattan, but really, in his heart of hearts, wanted to
make it just like everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   THE BEGINNING
</P>
<P>
   It began, as things usually do, with a girl. Her name was Joan
(last names have been omitted to protect the humiliated), a tall
theater-type with long black hair. We met at Luna Lounge, a
Manhattan bar that on Monday night becomes the bastion of New
York's alternative comedy scene. The place was what originally
piqued my interest in stand-up because the performers didn't
pander: hack jokes about mother-in-laws, priests and the
differences between men and women in bed were considered bad
manners.
</P>
<P>
   Joan, who was sitting in front of me, explained that she had
recently taken a stand-up comedy class and wanted to try going up
on stage. I suggested we check out an open mike later the same
night at Rebar.
</P>
<P>
   If Luna Lounge is where comedy is reborn, Rebar is where it is
stillborn. In the dark, nearly empty room, a parade of performers
did their five minutes nearly ignored by their fellow aspirants.
Over the next months, I would get to know all of them.
</P>
<P>
   The first person we saw that night was an awkward
twentysomething who, like many other open-mike dwellers, seemed to
perform mostly for self-therapy. She talked about her high school
problems (which were neither funny nor interesting) and accused the
audience of staring at her legs, which they weren't until she
mentioned them.
</P>
<P>
   Later, an obese comic who looked like Sam Kinison and sounded
like Selma Diamond confessed his love for the Spice Channel, the
pay-per-view adult cable network. The girl with more legs than
punch lines turned and asked what the Spice Channel was. I told her
it was a cooking network. That's when I knew that I, too, could be
a comic. Joan and I pledged to return there the next week to
perform.
</P>
<P>
   THE FIRST TIME
</P>
<P>
   I wrote my first joke by accident. A screenwriter friend was
lamenting how everything that people wanted to see blown up _
Congress, the White House, New York _ had already been done in the
movies. So we tried to think of other annoying things Americans
fantasize about seeing blown to bits: like bus shelter
advertisements depicting supermodels, joggers who run in place
while waiting for the light to change and cab drivers who speed up
when someone crosses the street in front of them.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, I came to two realizations: the first was that this
was comic material. Not necessarily good material but something to
say on stage. The second was that no conversation would ever be the
same. I'd be too busy trying to work anything vaguely humorous into
my act.
</P>
<P>
   While I was talking with a girlfriend that night, the next joke
materialized. It was a dirty joke, and it was strange because I am
not the kind of person who likes to talk crudely or buy erotic
cakes for friends. But after watching so much comedy, sexist
remarks were popping into my head almost subconsciously. It was the
first sign that stand-up comedy was poisoning my mind.
</P>
<P>
   I wrote the rest of my material in the same random way, making
an effort to read newspapers more closely and watch big movies on
opening night for topical material. Soon, I had my first routine.
</P>
<P>
   Joan and I arrived at Rebar at 7:30, paid our $3 cover charge
and signed up to perform. I used the alias Neil Todd, not just
because I didn't want preferential treatment as a journalist but,
more important, I didn't want to be recognized if I bombed.
</P>
<P>
   The guy who runs the night, a sweet, goofy average Joe named
Joe, who acted as if he was doing charity work for mentally
handicapped children, announced the night's running order. I was
number 25, and Joan was nearly last at 28.
</P>
<P>
   When I went on four and a half mostly unfunny hours later, right
hand sweatily clutching the black cordless microphone, I delivered
my killer bit about things to blow up. It met with complete
silence. That was my first lesson on the challenges of stand-up:
unlike applause for music and theater, laughter can't be faked.
</P>
<P>
   I had to think of something funny quickly. I couldn't afford to
die my first time on stage _ I'd never be back. After a half-second
that seemed like two minutes, my brain flashed back to the week
before at Rebar, and it came to me. ``I'm really disappointed with
Time Warner Cable,'' I began. ``I've been watching the Spice
channel a lot lately ... '' (There was applause for the Spice
Channel. I knew I was onto something unless it was just that Sam
Kinison guy.) `` ... And it hasn't helped me with my cooking at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, like water sputtering out of a faucet that hasn't been
used in years, laughter came. And, just as everybody said it would,
it filled me inside like a drug rush. I tried to stop it, but my
face flushed with a warm, red glow. Though my hands and knees
continued to shake, I sailed through the rest of the routine until
the red light over the stage told me that my five minutes were up.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   I left that night feeling neither elated nor depressed. I just
did it, like it was something I had to do. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE INITIATION
</P>
<P>
   The next Monday, I went to Rebar alone. Joan couldn't make it
because a friend had died in an airplane crash that had been all
over the news. Hearing a lot of bad jokes about the incident wasn't
going to make her feel any better. I was 20th this time: I was
already moving up.
</P>
<P>
   At the bar, two comics were talking:
</P>
<P>
   Guy: ``Have you ever taken a writing course?''
</P>
<P>
   Girl: ``Creative writing?''
</P>
<P>
   Guy: ``No, comedy writing. You have great presence on stage _
because of your experience in dance _ but your material isn't
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Girl: ``What?''
</P>
<P>
   Guy: ``Your jokes aren't funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Girl: ``To you, maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   Guy: ``No, really, they aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   After my routine, I begged for advice from a comic carrying a
clipboard, which I took to be a symbol of confidence and authority.
Her name was Robin, and she tipped me off to the other open mikes
around town.
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, she brought me to Boston Comedy Club and
introduced me to the night's MC, a short, bald guy who looked like
an angry Charlie Brown. ``This is Neil, he's a comic,'' she told
him. It was the first time I'd been introduced as a comic. And it
felt strange _ as if I were being called a lonely, disgusting slob
_ but exciting.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Robin asked if I wanted to go to an open mike at 5
p.m. the next day at Gotham Comedy Club. Since I had now been
officially ordained a comic, I couldn't refuse. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE COMEDOWN
</P>
<P>
   At Gotham, the embitterment began. Comics pay the club $3 for
the privilege of performing, plus all the soda they can drink.
Unlike Rebar, where 90 percent of the audience is comics, at Gotham
it's 100 percent. Everyone on stage kept apologizing for having
told the same jokes dozens of times previously while those in the
``audience'' scribbled notes in preparation for their own routines.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Yorkers can be so mean,'' I began my bit. ``Last week
there was an elderly lady beaten and mugged during rush hour in
midtown, and I stood and watched for a full 10 minutes and not once
did anyone do a thing to help or call the police.'' Silence. I
stuttered and apologized _ and then the audience laughed. I made a
mental note: to an audience of competing comics, failure is funny.
</P>
<P>
   From then on, it was all downhill. I got my first heckle, and
had no retort. The only other laughs came when I pulled the
microphone out of the stand and accidentally hit myself in the lip.
</P>
<P>
   When I walked offstage in disgrace, the club's host pulled me
aside: ``Don't worry,'' he said. ``They're all comics. They don't
laugh at each other.'' I thought about adding Gotham Comedy Club to
my list of things to blow up. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE FREAKS
</P>
<P>
   With Robin as my mentor, I soon learned the routine. It was
Mondays at Rebar, Tuesdays and Thursdays at Gotham, Wednesdays at
Collective Unconscious and Sundays at Surf Reality.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks on this sad little circuit, I began to improve. I
started speaking slower, my delivery was sharper, I wrote bits that
involved plants in the audience, I learned how to use a microphone
without hurting myself, and I started to understand the crowd
dynamic. A good standup creates a tension in the room, which the
audience wants to break with laughter. If you can do this, any
punch line will work as a release valve.
</P>
<P>
   At Gotham, the performers were a random bunch _ a policeman, a
drug dealer, a kindergarten teacher, a round-bellied insurance
salesman who had secretly harbored a ``burning need to do
stand-up'' for 18 years, and a housewife in her 60s who delivered
the most foul-mouthed jokes imaginable. But none of them liked to
discuss their day jobs: they acted as if the information would give
me a competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
   The only exception was a garrulous taxi driver from Westchester,
a huge gay ex-Marine with a handlebar mustache. ``I'd sleep with
him,'' he said about the talent booker at one club, ``but then they
forget about you afterwards. You get to the top by constantly being
a flirt and a tease.''
</P>
<P>
   The policeman was the night's host. ``It feels like a discussion
group at Bellevue in this room,'' he began. He wasn't joking, and
all the comics nodded in assent as they sat waiting for that
magical moment _ five minutes of being elevated by a couple of feet
on a stage, their voice amplified for a dozen people.
</P>
<P>
   The policeman ended the night with an explanation of what comic
bookers really mean when they give advice: ``If he says you're a
little too smart for the room, that means you're not funny. If he
says you're a little too hip for the room, again, not funny. If he
says you're a little too physical for the room, not only are you
not funny, you're also annoying.''
</P>
<P>
   THE NEXT STEP (DOWN)
</P>
<P>
   As my confidence increased, I branched out to new venues like
New York Comedy Club's Monday night open mike. What Nike is to
Asian children, this place was to comedians. The place was filthy,
the duct-tape covered microphone kept shorting out. There was a
yellowing poster for Andrew Dice Clay's ``Ford Fairlane'' on the
wall. Five rusty fans were scattered around the room to compensate
for the broken air conditioner, and the lock on the smelly bathroom
didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   Comics were asked to clean that bathroom in order to be a host
at a pre-show or open mike there, I was told, while more
experienced comics could work the door in exchange for performing.
</P>
<P>
   The owner, Al, a fat man smoking a stogie, was at the register,
taking $5 from each comic. He encouraged me to sign up for
pre-shows, which are the next step after open mikes. At pre-shows,
you don't have to pay to perform. But you have to bring in a
prescribed number of friends willing to cough up a cover charge and
drink minimum.
</P>
<P>
   It was easy to find friends for the first few pre-shows, then
the novelty wore off and I started asking everyone _ co-workers,
elementary-school classmates, strangers at parties, a taxi driver,
Jennifer Love Hewitt _ even offering to pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some free slots next week,'' chomped Big Al, ``and
all you have to bring is three people. Clubs like Caroline's will
ask for 15 people. And the drink minimum here is only five bucks.''
For an extra $10, someone would videotape the routine.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Another scam was called ``auditions.'' Everyone who showed up
got four minutes to play for Big Al. And not only did Big Al never
laugh. If he was bored, he would just yell, ``Thank you!''
mid-joke, reducing one potato-shaped woman who read erotic poetry
to tears. Whenever performers removed the malfunctioning microphone
from the stand, he would loudly demand that they put it back.
</P>
<P>
   My heart pounded through my shirt when I went up, a fear that
was worsened when I reached into my pocket and discovered that my
notes were missing. ``If I chip in for a new microphone, do I get a
headlining slot?'' I asked sarcastically, stalling for time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use the cheap microphone 'cause youse comics is always
breaking it,'' Al shot back unexpectedly.
</P>
<P>
   The only routine I could think of was a list of the top 10
reasons why open mike stand-up comedy has ruined my life, such as:
</P>
<P>
   1. Whenever I'm driving and I see a red light, I stop talking.
</P>
<P>
   2. All my friends are broke because of the drink minimums.
</P>
<P>
   3. My bathroom is filthy because I'm too exhausted after
cleaning the men's room at this club.
</P>
<P>
   4. All the free soda at Gotham Comedy club is rotting my teeth.
</P>
<P>
   5. Whenever I say something that makes my friends laugh, they
think I'm just practicing a ``routine'' on them.
</P>
<P>
   6. I usually am.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, there was a message on my machine: ``Hi, it's
the New York Comedy Club. We liked your audition and would like you
to do three pre-shows where you bring three people to each one.
It's our accelerated pre-show program. And for that, you get an
automatic call back and the owner will watch you the fourth time.
Call me and let me know when I can get in touch with you so we can
start this thing.'' No doubt every other comic who auditioned got
the same message.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't return the call. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE DEATH OF NEIL TODD
</P>
<P>
   To a stranger, the line that wrapped around the block on 81st
Street and Second Avenue one August evening must have looked like a
halfway house outing. Every comic in the city was there,
attention-starved neurotics of all shapes and sizes. The occasion
was the Comic Strip's seasonal lottery: any freak who showed up got
a number and an audition on a Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Each week, one comic out of six was selected to move on to stage
two, an audition with Lucien, one of the club's owners _ and then,
in the rarest cases and after several more hoops, a real booking.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, we filed inside, drew numbers out of a hat and
received a flyer advertising the club's eight-week, $325 comedy
workshop. My number was 96, which meant I'd have months to prepare.
It would be my first time in front of a real audience, and my last.
Afterward, I planned to retire Neil Todd.
</P>
<P>
   At the Comic Strip, auditioners never know what professional
comics will be performing with them. One white nerd ended up
delivering jokes about prep school on a black comedy bill with
Chris Rock. A woman performed on a high-school night, and the kids
heckled her until she broke down and started screaming at them.
</P>
<P>
   Four months later, my night came, and I joined the other comics
at the audition _ a 17-year-old red-headed boy, an overweight
student who said this would be his first time on stage and a
dark-haired woman in her 20s named Denise _ in the club's outer
lounge. Luckily, the night's headliners were ones I admired from
the Luna Lounge. Unlike the auditioners, they got paid _ $10 a
piece: Was that the brass ring we were all reaching for?
</P>
<P>
   At the bar nearby, one waitress asked what to do about the
people waiting in the lounge. ``Don't worry,'' another waitress
replied. ``They're not people. They're comics.''
</P>
<P>
   The house was sold-out, with 200 people, most of them on dates.
Denise got a few laughs. The overweight beginner bombed so badly
that the host, a leprechaun-looking redhead named Sam, felt obliged
to warn the audience to ``please be gentle and patient with'' us.
And the 17-year-old was hilarious.
</P>
<P>
   As I waited, one of the regular comics at the club walked up to
the host, Sam. ``What did you think of Denise's set?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was alright,'' Sam answered. ``She was good, but she's not
all the way there yet. There are a lot of places where she needs
some work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Give her the audition,'' the comic said. ``I just met her, and
I told her I'd put in a good word.'' He went on to explain in
precise mathematical terms how if Denise was selected his odds of
sleeping with her would be exponentially improved.
</P>
<P>
   Then the guy turned, saw me sitting there and said, ``Good luck
tonight.'' I wished him the same.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, I wasn't nervous on stage. I began by repeating snatches
of actual dialogue I'd overheard in the streets of New York (``just
because I killed someone doesn't mean I'm an expert''). Then I
listed phrases I'd never heard in New York: ``Excuse me, sir, I
believe you dropped your wallet.'' ``No, go ahead, take the cab.
You were here first.'' ``What this city really needs is a K-Mart.''
``Aren't you Neil Todd, the famous stand-up comedian?''
</P>
<P>
   The laughter came slowly and then escalated, as I knew it would
from practicing so much in pre-shows. I continued with the Spice
Channel joke and, for the first time, engaged in repartee with
audience members. Suddenly I realized that I had accomplished my
goal. It wasn't to perform at the Comic Strip or get hired for a
sitcom or write an expose. It was to cure my stage fright, to be
comfortable and successful onstage _ and I was. Every phrase
elicited laughter, even an apology for messing up a joke. Compared
with performing for other comics, this crowd was a piece of cake.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, I waited for Sam's critique. This would be the first
professional advice I'd gotten in all my time performing.
``Unfortunately we have a plethora of white comics, and don't
really need any more,'' he began. ``But'' _ I was hoping there'd be
a but _ ``you were good. I liked your set. It was funny. So perform
a bit more, and come back again and we'll try to move you to the
next level.'' The 17-year-old won the audition: Denise's new friend
was out of luck.
</P>
<P>
   Robin waited for me in the lounge. ``A lot of comics are told to
just give up or try something else,'' she said consolingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had gotten the audition, I'd have to keep performing,'' I
told her. ``This is a nice way to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So you're giving up?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not giving up. I accomplished my goals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But goals always change,'' she persisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see,'' I answered. ``I'm going to visit my brother in
San Francisco on Friday. I'll call you before then.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be great to have a change of scenery.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I wonder if there will be any open mikes in San
Francisco when I'm there?''
</P>
<P>
   Then we both laughed, and I realized that the bug that bit me
wasn't ever going to go away.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York City Opera and the musicians who perform
as part of its national touring company have settled a contract
dispute that had led to a cancellation of rehearsals on Sunday and
Monday and had imperiled a tour set to begin in San Antonio on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Talks had broken down when the musicians pressed the company to
include a clause in their new contract guaranteeing that the
touring orchestra would have at least 28 or 29 musicians. The
company agreed to a minimum of 28. Spokesmen for Local 802 of the
American Federation of Musicians said the new contract was ratified
on Tuesday evening and that the tour would begin on schedule.

`TURKS': GOOD COP, IMPERFECT COP: A MAN JUST DOING HIS BEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Program notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York metro area. Check local listings.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Sgt. Joe Turk is a cop's cop: father of two police officers and
father figure to dozens more at his Chicago station house. As
played by William Devane, he is the solid center of ``Turks,'' the
series that begins Thursday night on CBS. This is a workmanlike,
even imaginative blend of a family saga and a standard police
drama. But in Joe Turk, the show has a rare asset that sets it
apart.
</P>
<P>
   Devane's smirk, familiar from ``Knots Landing'' and a host of
other television vehicles, has aged into an expression of painful
understanding. In the frequent close-ups, Joe's craggy face seems
chiseled from granite. But his feet are clay, and he knows it.
Therein lies the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The first two episodes have the task of introducing this Irish
family and setting the tone for the series. Joe and his wife, Mary
(Helen Carey), live in a neat little house on a working-class
street. He's such a police guy, he even owns a police dog. Husband
and wife have grown apart. She finds her solace in the church. He
finds his in the job and his nightly visits to a cop bar where he
slowly nurses a drink and a special friendship with Ginny the
waitress (Ashley Crowe).
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the young Turks. Two of the brothers live in
another neat little house just up the block. The eldest, Mike
(David Cubitt), a detective, lives upstairs with his adoring wife
(Sarah Trigger) and their adoring son (Adam Tanguay). The middle
brother, Joey (Matthew John Armstrong), a uniformed officer, lives
downstairs. Both young policemen work out of Pop's precinct. The
youngest brother, Paul (Michael Muhney), a college student who
seems immune to the call of public service, lives at home.
</P>
<P>
   That's already eight people to keep track of, but the initial
episodes, written by the executive producer, Robert Singer (``Lois
and Clark,'' ``Midnight Caller'') present them as individuals,
which is an accomplishment. But not a miracle. The dialogue is
never memorable. This show lingers on the eye, not on the ear.
</P>
<P>
   All the central characters live in Joe's shadow. Shadows are the
visual motif here. These people seem to live in a dark, indoor
world, even in the daytime. And the views of Chicago at night,
including time-lapse sequences that bridge the various story
elements, help give the series a distinctive look.
</P>
<P>
   Among the things that happen in the first episodes: Mike fails
the sergeant's exam, not for the first time, and gets little
sympathy from Pop. ``Hey, this isn't about me,'' says Joe. ``I
didn't screw up the test.'' Well, see, it is about him, and he did
mess up another parental test. Paul, a secret gambler who is deep
in debt to his bookie, strays from the straight and narrow and is
caught by Joey, who puts family before his sworn duty, just this
once. ``Next time you're just a mutt like the rest of 'em,'' he
barks. So who's the mutt?
</P>
<P>
   This is a man's world. The women don't get much more to do but
worry and suffer. They get to do more of both in a later episode _
when Mike is seriously injured in the line of duty, his wife and
mother must deal with their worst fears _ and Ginny watches the
family close ranks in the crisis. Still, the focus is on Joe.
Despite his several lapses, he finds the hospital chapel and offers
God a bargain: his own life if his son's is spared.
</P>
<P>
   This may be trite. All right, it is trite. But in a network
series, a few interesting twists can often be enough to bring the
viewer back. Here you get twists and a fascinating character, a
flawed man trying desperately to do right in a world dripping with
wrong. He can't win, but may the struggle and the series continue.

<P>
   That's one more consecutive loss than the Trojans football team
has to the Bruins in this decade.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, USC seems on the verge of total collapse,
judging by the way the Trojans seemed to limp through most of the
contest. With seven of their final 11 games on the road, they might
be lucky to finish with a winning record.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the way they've looked lately, the Trojans might be
happy just to win another game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it is. We just need a collective fire,'' USC
forward Greg Lakey said. ``It's been kind of a struggle. It's
really been nerve-wracking to me. It seems like we're coming out
sluggish.''
</P>
<P>
   USC (10-6, 2-5) picked up where it left off last Saturday in its
loss to California. The Trojans were utterly confused offensively,
with players not knowing if they should shoot or pass, and a
turnover often the result.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play smart at all. We didn't make good decisions,''
USC coach Henry Bibby said. ``We made some bad decisions on the
floor. We just didn't do the things we needed to do. It wasn't our
night to win the basketball game.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss completed a disastrous three-game homestand for the
Trojans, who lost to Stanford, California and UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important that we lost, but we're 0-3 against three
very good basketball teams,'' Bibby said. ``I haven't lost
confidence in what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss dropped the Trojans to 1-4 at home in the Pacific-10
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Or to put it another way, the Trojans are 0-4 since Adam
Spanich's half-court shot at the buzzer defeated Oregon two weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Things were not nearly as dire for the 13th-ranked Bruins (13-4,
5-2), who breezed to another victory over the Trojans, and can now
rest for Saturday's contest at Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm most impressed with is the way we bounced back from
an emotional loss (to Stanford),'' UCLA coach Steve Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have a way to go before matching their longest
winning streak in the series. They won 18 straight from 1971-79.
</P>
<P>
   It was USC's most lopsided loss at the Sports Arena in 25 years.
The Trojans had never lost by more than nine points at home to the
Bruins during this current streak, and this was USC's worst loss at
the Sports Arena against UCLA since 1974, when the Trojans lost
82-52.
</P>
<P>
   Much like its football team, UCLA beat USC with offense.
</P>
<P>
   After building an 11-point halftime lead, the Bruins put the
game away with a 10-0 run to start the second half that gave them a
56-35 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The big player was freshman Ray Young, who had two impressive
dunks during the spurt and capped things with a 3-pointer that gave
UCLA a 59-37 lead.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the run was over, the only real entertainment left
was watching Lavin's antics on the sideline, as he jumped up and
down every time the Bruins scored a basket.
</P>
<P>
   He was probably happiest watching his freshmen. Jerome Moiso had
17 points and JaRon Rush added 16, including a trio of 3-pointers.
Center Dan Gadzuric scored 16 points and was 7 for 7 from the
field. Young had 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins also did a good job shutting down USC's best player,
center Brian Scalabrine, who had 13 points but made only 3 of 10
shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no secret, just play hard,'' Moiso said. ``He can
play outside and he can play inside. So I didn't focus on one
thing. I just tried to stay between him and the basket.''
</P>
<P>
   It was actually a competitive game early.
</P>
<P>
   After Lakey hit a short jumper to give the Trojans a 15-14 lead,
the Bruins took over. UCLA went on a 15-2 run, as Moiso made two
jump shots, and Ryan Bailey, Young and Baron Davis all hit
3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   By the time USC called timeout, UCLA led 29-17 and rode the
advantage for the remainder of the half.
</P>
<P>
   Elias Ayuso led USC with 16 points, while Scalabrine and Jarvis
Turner added 13.

STAINS ON INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE WON'T GO AWAY WITH
WHITEWASH 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   An acquaintance who once had a small role in Anchorage's attempt
to secure a Winter Olympic Games this decade told me a story years
ago about a visit by a few International Olympic Committee members
to Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Hosts from the bid committee seeking the Games made sure to take
their guests to a local landmark, Anchorage's most notorious strip
joint. Word was passed to the boss that important visitors needed
special treatment. They were ushered to a reserved room in the
back.
</P>
<P>
   The acquaintance didn't bear witness to the special treatment.
However, he did learn the next day from the IOC members that
Anchorage's hospitality was very impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Not impressive enough, however. Anchorage never won a Games bid.
</P>
<P>
   As you might have read, Salt Lake City did win the 2002 Winter
Games. Given what I know about the two places, at first blush it is
hard to imagine what Salt Lake provided that one of America's most
wide-open towns could not.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, does the Mormon capital really have that many more
chandeliers from which IOC members can swing?
</P>
<P>
   On second thought, Salt Lake City probably does. After all, the
doughty little Wasatch burg had failed in four previous attempts to
win the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Each time, the bid committee became a little smarter. By 1995's
IOC bid vote for 2002, the Salty Lakers knew all the important
things about IOC voters _ dental needs, relatives' college
requirements, entrepreneurial aspirations, investment
opportunities, lingerie fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   Those sorts of insights are what swung some votes to Nagano in
1998, Atlanta in 1996, Lillehammer in 1994, and so on. Sure, the
cities had to put up the odd bobsled run or velodrome. But when it
comes to a successful Olympic bid, the deal isn't about drywall or
refrigeration techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned that you either play the game, or you don't get the
Games,'' Reid Jones, a Salt Lake City financial consultant, told
the Boston Globe. ``We shouldn't have succumbed, but we did ... If
we could go back and do it all over again, I'd like to think we'd
walk away without losing our integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, really?
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Olympics became a worldwide TV showcase in the
1960s, competitive bribing of IOC officials has been standard
operating procedure. By 1986, matters were sufficiently out of hand
that the IOC passed rules about gift-giving and favor-granting.
They were promptly ignored, and the tassels kept twirling.
</P>
<P>
   No city that enters the bidding can have any conscience about
integrity. If Salt Lake had to do it over again, it would do it
over the same way, or risk losing the bid.
</P>
<P>
   Unless, that is, the current scandal that has blown the public
cover off this biannual scam completely wipes out the corrupt IOC
system and its practitioners, starting with Juan Antonio Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there's a happy thought.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch, the 19-year chief of the Olympics and former crony of
Spanish dictator Francisco Franco, has known this gig like his
backyard. His expressions of surprise and dismay are as hollow as
the Claude Rains character's claim to be ``shocked! shocked!'' that
gambling was going on in Bogart's ``Casablanca'' bistro.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the rounding up of the usual suspects needs to
include more than the disingenuous sillies of the Salt Lake
Organizing Committee. Mostly, they are just the latest willing
victims.
</P>
<P>
   Since it happened in the U.S., by the time this is over, every
do-good agency from the Justice Dept. to the Neah Bay anti-whalers
to the Power Rangers will have taken care of Salt Lake. The city's
best hope is that Attorney General Janet Reno doesn't mistake Salt
Lake for Waco and call in heavy ordnance.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is the IOC, which is answerable to no one. Already
beset by a virtually uncontrollable athlete-doping problem that
undermines Olympic credibility, the IOC and each member are now
under deep suspicion, if not already guilty, of selling out
whatever remains of the Olympic ideal.
</P>
<P>
   While it's probable some members have not gone to the highest
bidder, all are stained by the lame rationalization used in their
defense _ that gift-giving and favors are standard business
inducements outside North America that are not only considered
ethical, they are expected.
</P>
<P>
   If that's what two businesses, or cultures, do between
themselves, OK. But every Olympic bid in the U.S. involves big
commitments of public money from municipal, state and federal
sources, whether direct or indirect. In this culture, public money
is supposed to be accounted for, even if it's fronted by private
money.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, while there's a difference between a pen-and-pencil set
and a bribe, the line between the extremes is always a matter of
opinion and taste. Faced with that uncertainty, competitive bidders
usually err on the side of a weekend of hookers at Park City.
Apologies can come later.
</P>
<P>
   No amount of feigned ignorance or empty gestures by Samaranch
and his IOC cronies can whitewash the mess that has finally made
daylight.
</P>
<P>
   Best to take retirement now while spots are still available in
the witness protection program. There's going to be a rush.

UCLA FINDS MARK FROM LONG RANGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a season so illogical it almost makes sense _
losing at Oregon State and winning at Oregon? please _ the UCLA
Bruins submitted another bit of hypocrisy Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   What better venue to cure shooting woes than. . . . the Sports
Arena?
</P>
<P>
   After shooting 20 percent from 3-point range in six Pac-10
games, the Bruins pelted USC with unprecedented marksmanship _
shooting 70.4 percent from the field in the second half and making
10 of 16 shots from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the sweet shooting with typically tenacious defense, and
the result was one of UCLA's most impressive games of the season, a
98-80 victory over the Trojans before 10,986. It was UCLA's ninth
consecutive win in the city series and its largest victory margin
in the Sports Arena since 1974 _ the Walton Gang's final season.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA set season-highs in 3-pointers made and 3-point percentage
(62.5). Even freshman forward JaRon Rush, who has struggled from
the perimeter all season, had Sports Arena fever, making 3 of 5
3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight was a breakthrough for him from the perimeter,'' UCLA
coach Steve Lavin said. ``You could see the weight literally come
off his shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the Bruins drained their jumpers, USC extended its defense
to the perimeter. That opened the middle for the Bruins' big men,
Dan Gadzuric and Jerome Moiso, who played their best game as a
tandem, combining for 33 points on 15-of-22 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``They both played well,'' guard Baron Davis said.
``Offensively, everyone stepped up.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Sports Arena itself had little to do with UCLA's
offensive outburst. Rather, the success resulted from a confluence
of factors, including tempo. Instead of slowing the pace, USC was
content to play at UCLA's speed _ warp _ which allowed the Bruins
to find their rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Stanford, for instance, the Trojans did not pressure
passing lanes or deny dribble penetration. The Bruins were allowed
to pass and cut as they pleased _ much like they have done against
Arizona State for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to run as much as possible and make them guard us in
transition,'' said UCLA reserve Ray Young, who scored 12 points in
14 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, the Bruins' performance reflected Tuesday's
practice. They spent an hour on zone offense, with Lavin
emphasizing the basics _ movement and spacing _ and tweaking the
attack to suit UCLA's personnel. The Bruins let Davis, their most
creative player, roam the baseline to exploit seams, and they
ordered Moiso to make backside cuts to the foul line, where his
15-foot jumper is almost automatic.
</P>
<P>
   When the Trojans opened in a box-and-one _ four players in a
zone and the fifth, Elias Ayuso, playing Davis man-to-man _ the
Bruins carved it for nine points in five possessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stuck to what we do,'' Davis said. ``We have to have faith
in the offense. We could see in practice how it would open up, and
we just did the same thing in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Gadzuric sprained his right ankle and is questionable for
Saturday's game at Louisville. However, trainer Jeff Smith said it
was a low sprain, which usually heals faster than sprains high on
the ankle. Gadzuric left the Sports Arena hobbling but without
crutches.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Earl Watson survived the game without aggravating the deep
cut on his right (shooting) hand. He is fit to play Saturday, but
there's a slight chance he'll be held out to speed the healing
process before conference play resumes at Washington State next
Thursday.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Workers caught in the web of the Internet
 &HT;    For release Jan. 24, 1999.
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I never have been able to equate diminished unemployment figures
with the seemingly daily news that companies continue to downsize,
cutting 1,500 jobs here, 5,000 jobs there.
</P>
<P>
   Someone tried to explain to me that the people who lost their
jobs are being absorbed by new businesses that are opening, but I
keep seeing signs that humans continue to be on the decline when it
comes to job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Delta Air Lines announced it was adding a $2 surcharge
to all domestic bookings not made on Delta's Web site. This not
only raised the hackles among travel agents but ought to scare the
bejabbers out of the people at Delta who now take reservations over
the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   If everyone switches to the Web to save two bucks, there's going
to be a lot less need for people to take reservations over the
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   This concern probably was felt earlier by our parents and
grandparents when automation first began moving into the job
market. So disturbed were the unions that they instituted
featherbedding clauses in their contracts with major companies. In
featherbedding, the job continues no matter that the need for the
worker has been replaced by a machine.
</P>
<P>
   Delta is not blazing new trails with its announcement. Other
airlines, and other businesses, have their own version of how to
get rid of personnel by making it more financially desirable for
customers to work through the Web.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines, for instance, has a much cheaper rate for the
same flight if you order it from their Web site instead of through
one of their operators, or a travel agent. I recently bought a
plane ticket via the American Airlines Web site that cost me $166.
Doubling back that same day, I called a clerk at the airline to try
to deal in seat selection and was told that if I ordered that same
ticket through her, it would have cost me $243.
</P>
<P>
   Likely she won't be around much longer to talk with; for a
savings of $77 even I will talk to a computer _ and her job will be
extinct.
</P>
<P>
   I continue to wonder at Delta's policy, which openly penalizes
people who do not have computers AND Internet providers. Perhaps a
better public relations move, with a similar result, would have
been to give Web users a discount, as does American Airlines,
rather than give non-users a surcharge. I don't like either one,
but Delta's just seems more inequitable.
</P>
<P>
   I have been buying books via the Web at anywhere from $6 to $8
cheaper than what the same company _ Barnes and Noble _ is selling
at their retail stores. Even with the shipping charge, it comes to
several dollars cheaper than if I went into the store.
</P>
<P>
   So it pays to use the Web, provided you also can afford the
thousands of dollars to buy a computer system, along with the
monthly charge of an Internet provider.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, it's going to be quite convenient to buy just
about anything through the Web. As far as I can tell, the Web
doesn't need too many people. There's a human being on one side of
the transaction (the customer) and digital thingees at the other
end.

to work. This is a big opportunity for them. How they'll live,
however, is another story.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Monica sends a Dear John letter
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The United States Senate
</P>
<P>
   Washington, D. C.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sirs and Madams,
</P>
<P>
   Reporters say you are thinking of calling me to testify to you
about my relationship with President Clinton. Let me save you some
bother: Don't even try. If you so much as whisper the word
``subpoena'' in my direction, bang, it's catch me if you can. I'm
off to the South of France. Or Buenos Aires. Wherever. Anywhere but
your poisonous city.
</P>
<P>
   I've had it with you people. Yes, I know. The House case is
going nowhere in the Senate, and your little show is producing TV
ratings lower than Newt Gingrich's positives. Here you are,
posturing all over the tube and you'd get more exposure doing a
cameo on the morning news traffic report. Well, you're not going to
use me as ratings bait.
</P>
<P>
   Look, I've testified till I'm blue in the face. The FBI has
dragged me this way and that. That awful Kenneth Starr's people
interviewed me 22 times. And absolutely everybody has blabbed.
</P>
<P>
   And everybody has hung me out to dry. ``Handsome'' himself
turned out to be no prize. My supposedly good friend Linda Tripp
was just jerking me around so she and a book agent with a political
ax to grind could work up a best-seller. Linda even suggested I go
to Vernon Jordan to get a job out of Washington. What hot water
that landed me in! Now they're trying to make out that was a crime.
It wasn't even my idea, or the Big Creep's. It was Linda's, for
gosh sakes.
</P>
<P>
   Linda. I thought I was on my way to have lunch with her, but
she'd set me up. Two FBI agents jumped me. Next thing I know I'm in
a hotel room for hours and hours and crying and Starr's people are
all over me. They scare me out of calling my lawyer. They try to
get me to call one I don't trust. They threaten me with 27 years in
prison _ and threaten to send Mom to prison, too.
</P>
<P>
   All this just so I'll say what Bill and I did together. Well, I
finally do and then they make me tell it all over to a grand jury,
and then what do they do? They put every little detail on TV and
the Internet. They put out books. And talk radio shows have a field
day. Cable TV becomes Monica, Monica, Monica. Leno treats me like a
big ha-ha. They, all of them, made me into the nation's biggest
dirty joke.
</P>
<P>
   I've been used by the president. Used by the special prosecutor.
By talk-show freaks. By every bad stand-up comic. By the House
Judiciary Committee. The whole House. I've been Bill Clinton's sex
toy and Henry Hyde's political toy. (What's one more little
indiscretion, eh, Henry?)
</P>
<P>
   Enough! Sure, I'm still under Ken Starr's thumb. If I don't
testify to you, and say what he thinks is right, he can pull my
immunity and we're back at those 27 years in prison. Somehow,
though, I think real people would be up in arms if he tried that
and I'll bet the courts finally would start taking a serious look
at his whole strong-arm operation.
</P>
<P>
   So here's the bottom line: If you've got a subpoena for me, just
send it in care of General Delivery, South Pole. I'll pick it up
when the ice melts.
</P>
<P>
   XOXOXOXO,
</P>
<P>
   Monica

<P>
   When Duncan Watts was pursuing his Ph.D., his adviser was Steven
Strogatz, who has written scientific papers with Rennie Mirollo,
who was a teaching assistant for Steve Maurer, whose mother used to
live down the hall from my Grandma Rose in a high-rise in
Hackensack, N.J. Small world, right?
</P>
<P>
   Such coincidences crop up a lot. According to cocktail-party
lore, every pair of people on the planet _ a randomly chosen Inuit
and a Parisian, a Solomon Islander and a dude from Nebraska _ are
connected by a chain of at most six acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   I personally, to drop only a few names, am two steps from Prince
Charles and Stephen Hawking, three steps from Marilyn Monroe and
King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, four steps from King Juan Carlos of
Spain, and close friends with the brother of a childhood buddy of
the crown prince of Holland. And chances are you too have similar
connections.
</P>
<P>
   Strogatz and Watts study ``small worlds'' _ networks that
consist of lots of little cliques, but in which a few members of
each clique have connections to other, more distant parts of the
network.
</P>
<P>
   ``The small-world effect is not just a curiosity about social
networks,'' says Strogatz, an applied mathematician at Cornell.
``It occurs in many different kinds of networks throughout nature
and technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The small-world effect could have a lot to do with how diseases
like AIDS spread, for example: The idea that everyone is at most
six degrees apart takes on a sinister significance when we look for
shared sexual partners instead of shared acquaintances. It could
also explain how rumors spread, says Watts, who is now a
post-doctoral fellow at the Santa Fe Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Mathematically minded people, Strogatz explains, often approach
the small-world question with a simple calculation: Suppose I have
100 friends, each of whom also has 100 friends. A hundred times 100
makes 10,000 friends of my friends. If each of those 10,000 people
has 100 friends, there will be 1 million people three degrees away
from me. Five steps away, there are 10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``So a lot of people would say it's not surprising that the
degree of separation is small,'' concludes Strogatz, ``because
within five steps you've done the whole planet.''
</P>
<P>
   But that calculation presumes that each 100 friends are 100 new
people. In the real world many of one's friends know each other.
And it's easy to imagine a very exclusive clique of 100 people in
Greenwich, Conn., say, who know only one another and wouldn't dream
of associating with anyone outside their circle. Conceivably, no
chain of acquaintances connects you or me with any member of that
clique.
</P>
<P>
   ``So how do you even begin to think about these sorts of
networks?'' Watts asks.
</P>
<P>
   Watts and Strogatz began with a beautifully structured network
called a ring graph.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of a lot of people standing in a circle holding hands,''
Watts says. ``Say there are a million people and you know 100 of
them. You know 50 people on your left and 50 people on your right,
and they are the only ones you can communicate with. What if you
want to get a message to person number 500,000 on the other side of
the circle _ how do you do that? Well, you shout the message to
your farthest friend, number 50 to your left side, and say, `Pass
it on.' The best they can do is shout to their 50th friend to the
left, and so on.''
</P>
<P>
   On average, there are 5,000 steps between pairs of people in
this world. And 5,000 degrees of separation, as Watts points out,
is an awful lot.
</P>
<P>
   Now imagine the same million people standing in the same circle.
Each still has 100 friends. But instead of knowing only the 50
people to the left and the 50 to the right, everyone chooses
friends at random from the million people available. Now when he
and Strogatz calculate the average degree of separation between two
people, it comes out to about four.
</P>
<P>
   What happens between the orderly world and the random one? To
find out, Watts and Strogatz started with an orderly model and
carefully messed it up, making worlds that were progressively more
random. So instead of knowing the 50 people to your right and the
50 to your left, you might know the 50 to your right and 49 of the
50 to your left. But number 17 to your left is a stranger; instead
you're close friends with number 307,411.
</P>
<P>
   These new connections quickly bring the world closer together,
Watts says. In fact, it takes only a tiny number of rewirings _
less than 1 percent of the total connections _ to bring the average
degree of separation down from 5,000 to just over four, close to
the average degree of separation of a random world.
</P>
<P>
   How common are these small worlds in nature? Strogatz and Watts
began looking around for networks in which every connection was
known, allowing them to determine the shortest possible path
between any two points. Such networks were hard to find, but they
turned up three: the neural network of a nematode worm; the power
grid of the western United States; and the Hollywood graph, a
database of everyone who has ever acted in a feature film. People
use this very database _ available on the Web at
http://www.cs.virginia.edu/(TILDE)bct7m/
</P>
<P>
   bacon.html _ to play a game called Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon,
tracing connections between the ``Footloose'' thespian and other
Hollywood luminaries.
</P>
<P>
   Although Watts and Strogatz chose those three examples because
they were the only networks they could find in which all the
connections were known, all turned out to be small worlds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this as widespread a phenomenon as we guess it is?''
Strogatz asks. ``I would look forward in the future to work by,
say, neurologists mapping out brain networks or other nervous
systems. The people who study ecology could study food webs _ which
organisms are eating each other. In economics it would be
interesting to trace out networks of markets and consumers and
buyers and sellers. I'm sure there are people who are thinking
about network theory in economics and in finance _ it could be at
the level of whole nations interacting, or even just individual
people.''
</P>
<P>
   And chances are, you know someone who knows someone who knows
someone who knows someone who knows someone who knows those people.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   It was Christmas 1997, the peak of Hong Kong's bird flu crisis,
and Kennedy Shortridge, an Australian virologist who has called
Hong Kong home for almost 27 years, was in the Cheung Sha Wan
Wholesale Poultry Market with a team testing poultry for the avian
influenza virus designated A (H5N1).
</P>
<P>
   The previous spring, the virus had killed thousands of chickens
in farms bordering southern China. In May 1997 it killed a
3-year-old boy whose preschool had kept little chicks and
ducklings.
</P>
<P>
   Now this fluky virus was breaking out in humans again _ four
cases were confirmed in November, 13 in December. A third of the
victims were dying.
</P>
<P>
   Shortridge knew that the birds would have to go. So on Dec. 29,
the government slaughtered all the chickens in the markets and
farms, well over a million birds. No more human H5N1 cases.
</P>
<P>
   But what if H5N1 mutated into a form more at home in humans? Or
what if it joined in unholy matrimony with a human flu virus and
created viral offspring that spread easily _ flying from person to
person through coughs and sneezes?
</P>
<P>
   Robert Webster, a virologist at St. jude Children's Research
Hospital in Memphis, fears the result.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half the world's population would be dead by now.''
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Our world has been swept by three influenza pandemics in this
century. Virtually every person on Earth was infected with the
Spanish flu in 1918, and an estimated 30 million died.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian flu of 1957 killed about 70,000 Americans (figures for
the rest of the world are not known), and the Hong Kong flu of 1968
killed about 36,000.
</P>
<P>
   As far as we know, these flu pandemics, and the epidemics that
occur like aftershocks in between them, are caused by the influenza
virus' changeable nature: Epidemics result from genetic ``drift'' _
tiny mutations just large enough to let the virus slip by many
people's immune systems; pandemics, on the other hand, involve a
seismic ``shift'' _ gene substitutions so large they leave pretty
much everyone defenseless.
</P>
<P>
   Flu viruses belong to one of three families, designated
influenza A, B and C. Pandemics appear to be a specialty of type A
viruses (a group to which the Hong Kong chicken flu belongs).
</P>
<P>
   Like all flu viruses, they use single-stranded RNA as their
genetic material, and they make sloppy mistakes when they copy
themselves, so bit by bit the viruses change _ they drift from
their original form.
</P>
<P>
   But type A viruses are odd: Their RNA genome comes in eight
segments. If two different type A viruses infect the same cell at
once, they can shuffle their gene segments like cards in a deck.
</P>
<P>
   This reassortment can produce viral subtypes with combinations
of genetic material unlike any our immune systems are used to, with
genes that code for completely new H or N proteins, and maybe other
proteins as well.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1960s, flu researchers were beginning to understand
that reassortment was behind the sudden shifts that underlie
pandemics. They were also beginning to accept that the donors of
the new, dangerous genes were probably animals.

   It had long been known that domestic pigs get the flu: Every
fall since 1918, pigs in the United States have come down with
classic swine flu, a gift of the virus H1N1, which is a relative of
the 1918 human virus.
</P>
<P>
   The Hong Kong flu of 1968, however, had a hemagglutinin (a type
of protein) related to one found not in pigs but in birds.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of that pandemic, Webster became part of an
international surveillance team that would seek out the world's
wild flu reservoirs. By analyzing flu viruses in animals,
researchers hoped to trace the source of the genes that mingled
with human flu viruses to create such terrifyingly deadly strains.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1970s and early 1980s, Webster and his colleagues at
St. Jude amassed an impressive amount of evidence implicating birds
_ including ducks, geese, gulls and small shorebirds.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a nutshell,'' Webster says, ``you can find (influenza
viruses) wherever you look in migrating waterfowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Waterbirds are infected by the fecal-oral route. They pour out
huge quantities of virus in their feces. Surprisingly, the viruses
are passed from bird to bird but cause no disease at all.
</P>
<P>
   The genes of these bird viruses are at an apparent evolutionary
standstill _ so nicely adapted to their hosts that new mutations
offer no advantages and thus are not perpetuated.
</P>
<P>
   Bigger problems come when flu viruses get into domesticated
birds like chickens and turkeys _ species in which they are not so
well adapted _ and the evolutionary brakes are taken off. The
viruses make their new hosts sick, the hosts' immune systems
respond, and the viruses mutate to avoid the immune systems. They
may even kill their hosts.
</P>
<P>
   There had already been evidence that the 1957 and 1968 flu
pandemics were caused by human viruses that had substituted avian
genes _ probably from waterfowl _ for some of their own. Yet
catching flu from pigs seemed more likely.
</P>
<P>
   While humans don't carry receptors for bird flu on their cells,
pigs do. The going theory was that flu viruses might reassert more
easily, and become more compatible with humans, if they mixed in an
intermediate host like a pig.
</P>
<P>
   Pigs on farms in Asia (where both the 1957 and 1968 pandemics
originated) are often kept close to ducks and chickens. And pigs
have receptors in their snouts not just for their own swine virus
but for bird and human viruses as well.
</P>
<P>
   So, potentially, a pig could snort up a bird virus in infected
droppings or water, inhale a human virus spread by a coughing
farmer, and become a mixing vessel for the two. The viral progeny
might then infect humans nearby.
</P>
<P>
   What the Hong Kong outbreak has now demonstrated is that a
direct hop from birds to humans is absolutely possible. Maybe pigs
aren't as crucial as was thought. Yet, for now, the
pig-as-mixing-vessel theory is still seductive.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, researchers are catching their breath, immensely
relieved that H5N1 was nipped in the bud. But Webster feels that
another hop from birds to humans will occur in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   The Hong Kong outbreak, he adds, ``served as a warning of what
could happen. It was a killer _ like 1918 on its way.''

<P>
   It was Christmas 1997, the peak of Hong Kong's bird flu crisis,
and Kennedy Shortridge, an Australian virologist who has called
Hong Kong home for almost 27 years, was in the Cheung Sha Wan
Wholesale Poultry Market with a team testing poultry for the avian
influenza virus designated A (H5N1).
</P>
<P>
   The previous spring, the virus had killed thousands of chickens
in farms bordering southern China. In May 1997 it killed a
3-year-old boy whose preschool had kept little chicks and
ducklings.
</P>
<P>
   Now this fluky virus was breaking out in humans again _ four
cases were confirmed in November, 13 in December. A third of the
victims were dying.
</P>
<P>
   Shortridge knew that the birds would have to go. So on Dec. 29,
the government slaughtered all the chickens in the markets and
farms, well over a million birds. No more human H5N1 cases.
</P>
<P>
   But what if H5N1 mutated into a form more at home in humans? Or
what if it joined in unholy matrimony with a human flu virus and
created viral offspring that spread easily _ flying from person to
person through coughs and sneezes?
</P>
<P>
   Robert Webster, a virologist at St. jude Children's Research
Hospital in Memphis, fears the result.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half the world's population would be dead by now.''
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Our world has been swept by three influenza pandemics in this
century. Virtually every person on Earth was infected with the
Spanish flu in 1918, and an estimated 30 million died.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian flu of 1957 killed about 70,000 Americans (figures for
the rest of the world are not known), and the Hong Kong flu of 1968
killed about 36,000.
</P>
<P>
   As far as we know, these flu pandemics, and the epidemics that
occur like aftershocks in between them, are caused by the influenza
virus' changeable nature: Epidemics result from genetic ``drift'' _
tiny mutations just large enough to let the virus slip by many
people's immune systems; pandemics, on the other hand, involve a
seismic ``shift'' _ gene substitutions so large they leave pretty
much everyone defenseless.
</P>
<P>
   Flu viruses belong to one of three families, designated
influenza A, B and C. Pandemics appear to be a specialty of type A
viruses (a group to which the Hong Kong chicken flu belongs).
</P>
<P>
   Like all flu viruses, they use single-stranded RNA as their
genetic material, and they make sloppy mistakes when they copy
themselves, so bit by bit the viruses change _ they drift from
their original form.
</P>
<P>
   But type A viruses are odd: Their RNA genome comes in eight
segments. If two different type A viruses infect the same cell at
once, they can shuffle their gene segments like cards in a deck.
</P>
<P>
   This reassortment can produce viral subtypes with combinations
of genetic material unlike any our immune systems are used to, with
genes that code for completely new H or N proteins, and maybe other
proteins as well.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1960s, flu researchers were beginning to understand
that reassortment was behind the sudden shifts that underlie
pandemics. They were also beginning to accept that the donors of
the new, dangerous genes were probably animals.
</P>
<P>
   It had long been known that domestic pigs get the flu: Every
fall since 1918, pigs in the United States have come down with
classic swine flu, a gift of the virus H1N1, which is a relative of
the 1918 human virus.

<P>
   When Duncan Watts was pursuing his Ph.D., his adviser was Steven
Strogatz, who has written scientific papers with Rennie Mirollo,
who was a teaching assistant for Steve Maurer, whose mother used to
live down the hall from my Grandma Rose in a high-rise in
Hackensack, N.J. Small world, right?
</P>
<P>
   Such coincidences crop up a lot. According to cocktail-party
lore, every pair of people on the planet _ a randomly chosen Inuit
and a Parisian, a Solomon Islander and a dude from Nebraska _ are
connected by a chain of at most six acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   I personally, to drop only a few names, am two steps from Prince
Charles and Stephen Hawking, three steps from Marilyn Monroe and
King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, four steps from King Juan Carlos of
Spain, and close friends with the brother of a childhood buddy of
the crown prince of Holland. And chances are you too have similar
connections.
</P>
<P>
   Strogatz and Watts study ``small worlds'' _ networks that
consist of lots of little cliques, but in which a few members of
each clique have connections to other, more distant parts of the
network.
</P>
<P>
   ``The small-world effect is not just a curiosity about social
networks,'' says Strogatz, an applied mathematician at Cornell.
``It occurs in many different kinds of networks throughout nature
and technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The small-world effect could have a lot to do with how diseases
like AIDS spread, for example: The idea that everyone is at most
six degrees apart takes on a sinister significance when we look for
shared sexual partners instead of shared acquaintances. It could
also explain how rumors spread, says Watts, who is now a
post-doctoral fellow at the Santa Fe Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Mathematically minded people, Strogatz explains, often approach
the small-world question with a simple calculation: Suppose I have
100 friends, each of whom also has 100 friends. A hundred times 100
makes 10,000 friends of my friends. If each of those 10,000 people
has 100 friends, there will be 1 million people three degrees away
from me. Five steps away, there are 10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``So a lot of people would say it's not surprising that the
degree of separation is small,'' concludes Strogatz, ``because
within five steps you've done the whole planet.''
</P>
<P>
   But that calculation presumes that each 100 friends are 100 new
people. In the real world many of one's friends know each other.
And it's easy to imagine a very exclusive clique of 100 people in
Greenwich, Conn., say, who know only one another and wouldn't dream
of associating with anyone outside their circle. Conceivably, no
chain of acquaintances connects you or me with any member of that
clique.
</P>
<P>
   ``So how do you even begin to think about these sorts of
networks?'' Watts asks.
</P>
<P>
   Watts and Strogatz began with a beautifully structured network
called a ring graph.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of a lot of people standing in a circle holding hands,''
Watts says. ``Say there are a million people and you know 100 of
them. You know 50 people on your left and 50 people on your right,
and they are the only ones you can communicate with. What if you
want to get a message to person number 500,000 on the other side of
the circle _ how do you do that? Well, you shout the message to
your farthest friend, number 50 to your left side, and say, `Pass
it on.' The best they can do is shout to their 50th friend to the
left, and so on.''
</P>
<P>
   On average, there are 5,000 steps between pairs of people in
this world. And 5,000 degrees of separation, as Watts points out,
is an awful lot.
</P>
<P>
   Now imagine the same million people standing in the same circle.
Each still has 100 friends. But instead of knowing only the 50
people to the left and the 50 to the right, everyone chooses
friends at random from the million people available. Now when he
and Strogatz calculate the average degree of separation between two
people, it comes out to about four.
</P>
<P>
   What happens between the orderly world and the random one? To
find out, Watts and Strogatz started with an orderly model and
carefully messed it up, making worlds that were progressively more
random. So instead of knowing the 50 people to your right and the
50 to your left, you might know the 50 to your right and 49 of the
50 to your left. But number 17 to your left is a stranger; instead
you're close friends with number 307,411.
</P>
<P>
   These new connections quickly bring the world closer together,
Watts says. In fact, it takes only a tiny number of rewirings _
less than 1 percent of the total connections _ to bring the average
degree of separation down from 5,000 to just over four, close to
the average degree of separation of a random world.
</P>
<P>
   How common are these small worlds in nature? Strogatz and Watts
began looking around for networks in which every connection was
known, allowing them to determine the shortest possible path
between any two points. Such networks were hard to find, but they
turned up three: the neural network of a nematode worm; the power
grid of the western United States; and the Hollywood graph, a
database of everyone who has ever acted in a feature film. People
use this very database _ available on the Web at
http://www.cs.virginia.edu/(TILDE)bct7m/
</P>
<P>
   bacon.html _ to play a game called Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon,
tracing connections between the ``Footloose'' thespian and other
Hollywood luminaries.
</P>
<P>
   Although Watts and Strogatz chose those three examples because
they were the only networks they could find in which all the
connections were known, all turned out to be small worlds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this as widespread a phenomenon as we guess it is?''
Strogatz asks. ``I would look forward in the future to work by,
say, neurologists mapping out brain networks or other nervous
systems. The people who study ecology could study food webs _ which
organisms are eating each other. In economics it would be
interesting to trace out networks of markets and consumers and
buyers and sellers. I'm sure there are people who are thinking
about network theory in economics and in finance _ it could be at
the level of whole nations interacting, or even just individual
people.''
</P>
<P>
   And chances are, you know someone who knows someone who knows
someone who knows someone who knows someone who knows those people.

</P>
<P>
   These new connections quickly bring the world closer together,
Watts says. In fact, it takes only a tiny number of rewirings _
less than 1 percent of the total connections _ to bring the average
degree of separation down from 5,000 to just over four, close to
the average degree of separation of a random world.
</P>
<P>
   How common are these small worlds in nature? Strogatz and Watts
began looking around for networks in which every connection was
known, allowing them to determine the shortest possible path
between any two points. Such networks were hard to find, but they
turned up three: the neural network of a nematode worm; the power
grid of the western United States; and the Hollywood graph, a
database of everyone who has ever acted in a feature film. People
use this very database _ available on the Web at
http://www.cs.virginia.edu/(TILDE)bct7m/
</P>
<P>
   bacon.html _ to play a game called Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon,
tracing connections between the ``Footloose'' thespian and other
Hollywood luminaries.
</P>
<P>
   Although Watts and Strogatz chose those three examples because
they were the only networks they could find in which all the
connections were known, all turned out to be small worlds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this as widespread a phenomenon as we guess it is?''
Strogatz asks. ``I would look forward in the future to work by,
say, neurologists mapping out brain networks or other nervous
systems. The people who study ecology could study food webs _ which
organisms are eating each other. In economics it would be
interesting to trace out networks of markets and consumers and
buyers and sellers. I'm sure there are people who are thinking
about network theory in economics and in finance _ it could be at
the level of whole nations interacting, or even just individual
people.''
</P>
<P>
   And chances are, you know someone who knows someone who knows
someone who knows someone who knows someone who knows those people.

   It was Christmas 1997, the peak of Hong Kong's bird flu crisis,
and Kennedy Shortridge, an Australian virologist who has called
Hong Kong home for almost 27 years, was in the Cheung Sha Wan
Wholesale Poultry Market with a team testing poultry for the avian
influenza virus designated A (H5N1).
</P>
<P>
   The previous spring, the virus had killed thousands of chickens
in farms bordering southern China. In May 1997 it killed a
3-year-old boy whose preschool had kept little chicks and
ducklings.
</P>
<P>
   Now this fluky virus was breaking out in humans again _ four
cases were confirmed in November, 13 in December. A third of the
victims were dying.
</P>
<P>
   Shortridge knew that the birds would have to go. So on Dec. 29,
the government slaughtered all the chickens in the markets and
farms, well over a million birds. No more human H5N1 cases.
</P>
<P>
   But what if H5N1 mutated into a form more at home in humans? Or
what if it joined in unholy matrimony with a human flu virus and
created viral offspring that spread easily _ flying from person to
person through coughs and sneezes?
</P>
<P>
   Robert Webster, a virologist at St. jude Children's Research
Hospital in Memphis, fears the result.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half the world's population would be dead by now.''
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Our world has been swept by three influenza pandemics in this
century. Virtually every person on Earth was infected with the
Spanish flu in 1918, and an estimated 30 million died.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian flu of 1957 killed about 70,000 Americans (figures for
the rest of the world are not known), and the Hong Kong flu of 1968
killed about 36,000.
</P>
<P>
   As far as we know, these flu pandemics, and the epidemics that
occur like aftershocks in between them, are caused by the influenza
virus' changeable nature: Epidemics result from genetic ``drift'' _
tiny mutations just large enough to let the virus slip by many
people's immune systems; pandemics, on the other hand, involve a
seismic ``shift'' _ gene substitutions so large they leave pretty
much everyone defenseless.
</P>
<P>
   Flu viruses belong to one of three families, designated
influenza A, B and C. Pandemics appear to be a specialty of type A
viruses (a group to which the Hong Kong chicken flu belongs).
</P>
<P>
   Like all flu viruses, they use single-stranded RNA as their
genetic material, and they make sloppy mistakes when they copy
themselves, so bit by bit the viruses change _ they drift from
their original form.
</P>
<P>
   But type A viruses are odd: Their RNA genome comes in eight
segments. If two different type A viruses infect the same cell at
once, they can shuffle their gene segments like cards in a deck.
</P>
<P>
   This reassortment can produce viral subtypes with combinations
of genetic material unlike any our immune systems are used to, with
genes that code for completely new H or N proteins, and maybe other
proteins as well.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1960s, flu researchers were beginning to understand
that reassortment was behind the sudden shifts that underlie
pandemics. They were also beginning to accept that the donors of
the new, dangerous genes were probably animals.
</P>
<P>
   It had long been known that domestic pigs get the flu: Every
fall since 1918, pigs in the United States have come down with
classic swine flu, a gift of the virus H1N1, which is a relative of
the 1918 human virus.
</P>
<P>
   The Hong Kong flu of 1968, however, had a hemagglutinin (a type
of protein) related to one found not in pigs but in birds.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of that pandemic, Webster became part of an
international surveillance team that would seek out the world's
wild flu reservoirs. By analyzing flu viruses in animals,
researchers hoped to trace the source of the genes that mingled
with human flu viruses to create such terrifyingly deadly strains.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1970s and early 1980s, Webster and his colleagues at
St. Jude amassed an impressive amount of evidence implicating birds
_ including ducks, geese, gulls and small shorebirds.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a nutshell,'' Webster says, ``you can find (influenza
viruses) wherever you look in migrating waterfowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Waterbirds are infected by the fecal-oral route. They pour out
huge quantities of virus in their feces. Surprisingly, the viruses
are passed from bird to bird but cause no disease at all.
</P>
<P>
   The genes of these bird viruses are at an apparent evolutionary
standstill _ so nicely adapted to their hosts that new mutations
offer no advantages and thus are not perpetuated.
</P>
<P>
   Bigger problems come when flu viruses get into domesticated
birds like chickens and turkeys _ species in which they are not so
well adapted _ and the evolutionary brakes are taken off. The
viruses make their new hosts sick, the hosts' immune systems
respond, and the viruses mutate to avoid the immune systems. They
may even kill their hosts.
</P>
<P>
   There had already been evidence that the 1957 and 1968 flu
pandemics were caused by human viruses that had substituted avian
genes _ probably from waterfowl _ for some of their own. Yet
catching flu from pigs seemed more likely.
</P>
<P>
   While humans don't carry receptors for bird flu on their cells,
pigs do. The going theory was that flu viruses might reassert more
easily, and become more compatible with humans, if they mixed in an
intermediate host like a pig.
</P>
<P>
   Pigs on farms in Asia (where both the 1957 and 1968 pandemics
originated) are often kept close to ducks and chickens. And pigs
have receptors in their snouts not just for their own swine virus
but for bird and human viruses as well.
</P>
<P>
   So, potentially, a pig could snort up a bird virus in infected
droppings or water, inhale a human virus spread by a coughing
farmer, and become a mixing vessel for the two. The viral progeny
might then infect humans nearby.
</P>
<P>
   What the Hong Kong outbreak has now demonstrated is that a
direct hop from birds to humans is absolutely possible. Maybe pigs
aren't as crucial as was thought. Yet, for now, the
pig-as-mixing-vessel theory is still seductive.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, researchers are catching their breath, immensely
relieved that H5N1 was nipped in the bud. But Webster feels that
another hop from birds to humans will occur in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   The Hong Kong outbreak, he adds, ``served as a warning of what
could happen. It was a killer _ like 1918 on its way.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA _ At a farmers' market here, overrun with as many flies
as customers, vendor Ramon Vega quietly criticizes the Cuban
government for raising his taxes from $4 to $6 a day (in U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
   Still, the gaunt entrepreneur says he ekes out a decent living
by hawking tomatoes no bigger than plums, as well as other
products.
</P>
<P>
   He says he has recently heard rumors that the government may
shut down the farmers' markets, but he's praying that they're not
true.
</P>
<P>
   ``By raising taxes, the government is making it harder for us to
do business, but certainly the farmers need these markets to make
ends meet,'' he laments.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers' markets surfaced here in 1994 as a way to ease the
massive food shortages that followed the collapse of the Soviet
Union, Cuba's prime benefactor.
</P>
<P>
   They are well-stocked with everything from chicken to cucumbers,
all sold at prices established by simple supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
   The goods are supplied by farmers permitted to sell their
surplus after meeting production quotas set by the state.
</P>
<P>
   Similar markets were allowed in 1981, but were closed in 1986 by
government officials concerned the farmers had grown too rich.
</P>
<P>
   Now experts warn they might be closed again, or seriously
curtailed due to onerous restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years after his Jan. 1, 1959 revolution, President Fidel
Castro appears to be putting the brakes on economic reforms that
marked the first years of this decade.
</P>
<P>
   The shift is due, in part, to the financial meltdowns in Asia
and elsewhere, which Castro points to as proof that Cuba's
socialism remains the best model after all.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, ``the Cuban regime has been frozen in its
economic course,'' said Damian Fernandez, an expert on Cuba at
Florida International University in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   In recent speeches, Castro, now 72, has made a point of
reconfirming his adherence to communist ideology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economic order which dominates the planet will inevitably
fall,'' he predicted earlier this month, adding that globalization
has turned the planet into one giant casino.
</P>
<P>
   For certain, the die-hard Marxist, whose welfare state still
boasts free education and health care, never wanted to flirt with
capitalism in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   But he was forced to adopt limited free-market reforms in the
early 1990s in the face of economic ruin following the loss of $4
billion in annual Soviet subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1993, Cubans could be imprisoned for possessing American
dollars, whereas today they are the country's most sought-after
currency. As a result, the Cuban peso has been so weakened that
hotel busboys now earn more in daily tips than brain surgeons earn
in monthly salaries.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, once-lambasted private enterprises have been
allowed to flourish -- at least in small doses.
</P>
<P>
   But over the past year or so, the government has imposed a
series of crackdowns on private-sector activity.
</P>
<P>
   Some businesses are now illegal, and those that are legal aren't
allowed to employ anyone other than relatives. For example, neither
the private selling of fish nor private retail stores are allowed.
In addition, sellers must remain mobile, easily pushed from place
to place.
</P>
<P>
   The moves have discouraged foreign companies, so much so that
even investment in Cuba's new free zones -- tax-free areas where
companies are encouraged to locate -- has fallen flat.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban government officials agree that the number of
self-employed people has decreased, from 250,000 in 1994 to 200,000
today.
</P>
<P>
   But they insist foreign investment continues to mushroom, citing
340 joint ventures between Cuba and foreign investors today,
compared with 50 in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no backtrack policy,'' said government spokesman
Roberto de Armas.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you see now in the private sector is going to stay and
develop,'' he added. ``But we are never going to give up our
socialist achievements either.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the reason the number of self-employed people has
dropped is because some businesses simply weren't efficient enough
to compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first allowed self-employment, everyone wanted to be
self-employed, but obviously some are not going to make it, and
that's the way a real market is supposed to work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Increased investment is clear on the streets of this fading
beauty of a city, where vintage Fords and Chevrolets from the 1950s
roam beside gaudy new hotels, U.S.-style malls, and even 24-hour
service stations.
</P>
<P>
   American businesses, too, increasingly have their eyes on the
Cuban market. The number of U.S. executives traveling to Cuba
jumped last year to 2,500, from 500 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not reforms have stalled, free enterprise already has
established a modest beachhead on this communist island 90 miles
south of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   More artisans are selling their paintings. More Cubans are
renting spare rooms in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Limited reforms ``have created a market-based sector where
Cubans learn capitalism, earn more and in some cases have tangible
economic freedom,'' said Philip Peters, a senior fellow at the
Alexis de Tocqueville Institution in Arlington, Va.
</P>
<P>
   But experts say the Cuban economy still has a long way to go,
and that more economic adjustments are needed to boost
private-sector activity.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jose Luis Rodriguez, minister of economy and
planning, Cuba's economy grew by a paltry 1.2 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   The poor showing can be blamed partly on a sugar harvest that
was the smallest in 50 years due to weather-related disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban government officials also point a finger at the stifling
U.S. economic embargo against Cuba that was imposed in 1961 and
prohibits American investment and spending there.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial Helms-Burton law, enacted in 1996 after Cuba
shot down pilots from an anti-Castro group, tightened that embargo
even more by punishing foreign companies that do business in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Cuban economy rests largely on two pillars: tourism
and remittances.
</P>
<P>
   Money sent by Cuban exiles to relatives in Cuba is now estimated
to bring in more than $800 million a year. Tourism attracts more
than $1 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say a real economic boom may be years away, especially
if the government moves toward a socialist system that's more
tightly controlled.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, they say Cuba's nearly 12 million people can expect
little change this year.
</P>
<P>
   As Castro defiantly proclaimed in a speech earlier this month:
``The revolution has just begun.''

   HAVANA _ At a farmers' market here, overrun with as many flies
as customers, vendor Ramon Vega quietly criticizes the Cuban
government for raising his taxes from $4 to $6 a day (in U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
   Still, the gaunt entrepreneur says he ekes out a decent living
by hawking tomatoes no bigger than plums, as well as other
products.
</P>
<P>
   He says he has recently heard rumors that the government may
shut down the farmers' markets, but he's praying that they're not
true.
</P>
<P>
   ``By raising taxes, the government is making it harder for us to
do business, but certainly the farmers need these markets to make
ends meet,'' he laments.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers' markets surfaced here in 1994 as a way to ease the
massive food shortages that followed the collapse of the Soviet
Union, Cuba's prime benefactor.
</P>
<P>
   They are well-stocked with everything from chicken to cucumbers,
all sold at prices established by simple supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
   The goods are supplied by farmers permitted to sell their
surplus after meeting production quotas set by the state.
</P>
<P>
   Similar markets were allowed in 1981, but were closed in 1986 by
government officials concerned the farmers had grown too rich.
</P>
<P>
   Now experts warn they might be closed again, or seriously
curtailed due to onerous restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years after his Jan. 1, 1959 revolution, President Fidel
Castro appears to be putting the brakes on economic reforms that
marked the first years of this decade.
</P>
<P>
   The shift is due, in part, to the financial meltdowns in Asia
and elsewhere, which Castro points to as proof that Cuba's
socialism remains the best model after all.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, ``the Cuban regime has been frozen in its
economic course,'' said Damian Fernandez, an expert on Cuba at
Florida International University in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   In recent speeches, Castro, now 72, has made a point of
reconfirming his adherence to communist ideology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economic order which dominates the planet will inevitably
fall,'' he predicted earlier this month, adding that globalization
has turned the planet into one giant casino.
</P>
<P>
   For certain, the die-hard Marxist, whose welfare state still
boasts free education and health care, never wanted to flirt with
capitalism in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   But he was forced to adopt limited free-market reforms in the
early 1990s in the face of economic ruin following the loss of $4
billion in annual Soviet subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1993, Cubans could be imprisoned for possessing American
dollars, whereas today they are the country's most sought-after
currency. As a result, the Cuban peso has been so weakened that
hotel busboys now earn more in daily tips than brain surgeons earn
in monthly salaries.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, once-lambasted private enterprises have been
allowed to flourish -- at least in small doses.
</P>
<P>
   But over the past year or so, the government has imposed a
series of crackdowns on private-sector activity.
</P>
<P>
   Some businesses are now illegal, and those that are legal aren't
allowed to employ anyone other than relatives. For example, neither
the private selling of fish nor private retail stores are allowed.
In addition, sellers must remain mobile, easily pushed from place
to place.
</P>
<P>
   The moves have discouraged foreign companies, so much so that
even investment in Cuba's new free zones -- tax-free areas where
companies are encouraged to locate -- has fallen flat.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban government officials agree that the number of
self-employed people has decreased, from 250,000 in 1994 to 200,000
today.
</P>
<P>
   But they insist foreign investment continues to mushroom, citing
340 joint ventures between Cuba and foreign investors today,
compared with 50 in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no backtrack policy,'' said government spokesman
Roberto de Armas.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you see now in the private sector is going to stay and
develop,'' he added. ``But we are never going to give up our
socialist achievements either.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the reason the number of self-employed people has
dropped is because some businesses simply weren't efficient enough
to compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first allowed self-employment, everyone wanted to be
self-employed, but obviously some are not going to make it, and
that's the way a real market is supposed to work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Increased investment is clear on the streets of this fading
beauty of a city, where vintage Fords and Chevrolets from the 1950s
roam beside gaudy new hotels, U.S.-style malls, and even 24-hour
service stations.
</P>
<P>
   American businesses, too, increasingly have their eyes on the
Cuban market. The number of U.S. executives traveling to Cuba
jumped last year to 2,500, from 500 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not reforms have stalled, free enterprise already has
established a modest beachhead on this communist island 90 miles
south of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   More artisans are selling their paintings. More Cubans are
renting spare rooms in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Limited reforms ``have created a market-based sector where
Cubans learn capitalism, earn more and in some cases have tangible
economic freedom,'' said Philip Peters, a senior fellow at the
Alexis de Tocqueville Institution in Arlington, Va.
</P>
<P>
   But experts say the Cuban economy still has a long way to go,
and that more economic adjustments are needed to boost
private-sector activity.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jose Luis Rodriguez, minister of economy and
planning, Cuba's economy grew by a paltry 1.2 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   The poor showing can be blamed partly on a sugar harvest that
was the smallest in 50 years due to weather-related disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban government officials also point a finger at the stifling
U.S. economic embargo against Cuba that was imposed in 1961 and
prohibits American investment and spending there.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial Helms-Burton law, enacted in 1996 after Cuba
shot down pilots from an anti-Castro group, tightened that embargo
even more by punishing foreign companies that do business in Cuba.
</P>

   PANAMA CITY, Panama _ In the Panama Canal, ships are raised like
toys, step by step, through three sets of locks to a height of 85
feet above sea level, on their way from the Atlantic Ocean to the
Pacific and back again.
</P>
<P>
   The vessels are tugged through the locks by ``mules,'' or
electric locomotives on train tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Each passage requires 52 million gallons of fresh water to
equalize the water levels in these locks.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, no pumps are used, meaning that gravity is all
that pulls the swirling water from the surrounding watershed into
the locks' chambers.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 85 years after its completion, these 50 miles of man-made
ditch are still an engineering wonder to behold, and the most
popular tourist attraction in this Ohio-sized country.
</P>
<P>
   The Panama Canal is one of the greatest civil engineering
achievements of this century, which are often referred to as the
Seven Wonders of the Modern World.
</P>
<P>
   The others are the Suez Canal, the Dneproges Dam in Ukraine, the
Alaska-Canada Highway, the Golden Gate Bridge, the Empire State
Building, and the Eifel Tower.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, this S-shaped isthmus has its share of white beaches,
dense rainforests, and colonial architecture.
</P>
<P>
   But so does Panama's better-marketed neighbor to the north,
Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   What Costa Rica doesn't have, of course, is the canal.
</P>
<P>
   Situated between Costa Rica and Colombia, Panama links North and
South America and the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.
</P>
<P>
   The Panama Canal runs northwest to southeast, utilizing locks at
both ends, an existing river and a man-made lake.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the Panamanian government prepares to take control of
the canal and surrounding properties, a massive push has been
launched to attract tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Panama's always been a comfortable place for Americans to visit:
English is widely spoken, tap water is safe for drinking, and the
U.S. dollar is the official currency.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Panama Canal treaties signed in 1977, Panama will take
sole possession not only of the canal on Dec. 31, 1999, but also of
some 250,000 acres of land, along with seven U.S. military bases,
golf courses, movie theaters, airports and other installations
bordering the canal.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism is a giant part of the Panamanian government's plans to
redevelop these properties.
</P>
<P>
   Already underway are projects to build new hotels in the
rainforests and to re-establish passenger service within two years
on the 143-year-old Panama Railway that runs alongside the canal.
</P>
<P>
   Nicolas Ardito Barletta directs the Inter-Oceanic Regional
Authority, the agency charged with overseeing foreign investment in
the converted areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 300 cruise ships passing through the canal every year
but none of them stop because we don't have the facilities to serve
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Panama's biggest goal is to build facilities on both the
Pacific and the Atlantic within five years that can accommodate up
to 250 cruise ships a year.
</P>
<P>
   And, for sure, the passengers on those ships will want to see
the canal.
</P>
<P>
   Today, visitors can see the canal at Miraflores Locks, which
offers an air-conditioned visitors center and an observation deck
where ships can be viewed as they pass through the locks.
</P>
<P>
   By October 1999, construction of a new, three-story visitors
center is due to be finished, complete with a higher observation
deck, as well as a bar, restaurant and interactive game area.
</P>
<P>
   Here, ships look like corks trying to squeeze through the
opening of a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The locks are only 110 feet wide and the biggest ships are 106
feet wide, so there's only two feet of clearance on either side,''
explained Jamie Robleto, a tour guide.
</P>
<P>
   In general, it's easy to see why a French company employing a
small army went bankrupt trying to excavate this huge path in the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   The project was launched in 1882 and ended in disaster seven
years later with over 22,000 people dying from malaria and other
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The United States took over the project in 1903 and finished
construction in 1914.
</P>
<P>
   At Miraflores Locks, a short film in English and a team of
bilingual guides provide visitors with all sorts of canal-related
facts and figures.
</P>
<P>
   For example, more than 13,100 ships traverse the canal each
year, paying tolls based on tonnage and number of passengers
aboard.
</P>
<P>
   The highest toll was $141,344, paid by the Crown Princess Cruise
Ship in 1993. The lowest toll was 36 cents, paid by Richard
Halliburton, who swam the canal in 1928.
</P>
<P>
   Miraflores Locks is just minutes by car from Panama City, the
oldest Spanish settlement on the American mainland which is really
three cities rolled into one.
</P>
<P>
   Stone ruins are all that's left of Panama Vieja, the original
settlement burned in 1671 by pirate Henry Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   In its place is the colonial Casco Viejo, a picturesque section
of the city where white houses with ornamental iron balconies line
winding, narrow streets.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the flashy, modern part of the city, where gleaming
high-rise banks and hotels dot the skyline.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of Panama's 2.8 million people live in and around
Panama City, which sits on the Pacific side of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the canal an easy visit from Panama City, but the
capital is also a good point from which to set off on day-trips to
see the wildlife in the Soberania National Park and in the
rainforest part of the Barro Colorado Nature Monument, which
consists of the 3,800-acre Barro Colorado Island and five adjacent
peninsulas in the man-made Gatun Lake.
</P>
<P>
   In Panama, which boasts large, unspoiled forests, a fourth of
the land has been established as national parks and preserves.
</P>
<P>
   According to Barletta, 357 varieties of birds have been spotted
in one day by the National Audubon Society in some parts of Panama.
</P>
<P>
   ``Panama has more biodiversity than even Costa Rica, it's just
that few people know about this,'' he said. ``We want to let people
know that, while the canal is the main thing, there's lots to see
here.''

</P>
<P>
   In its place is the colonial Casco Viejo, a picturesque section
of the city where white houses with ornamental iron balconies line
winding, narrow streets.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the flashy, modern part of the city, where gleaming
high-rise banks and hotels dot the skyline.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of Panama's 2.8 million people live in and around
Panama City, which sits on the Pacific side of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the canal an easy visit from Panama City, but the
capital is also a good point from which to set off on day-trips to
see the wildlife in the Soberania National Park and in the
rainforest part of the Barro Colorado Nature Monument, which
consists of the 3,800-acre Barro Colorado Island and five adjacent
peninsulas in the man-made Gatun Lake.
</P>
<P>
   In Panama, which boasts large, unspoiled forests, a fourth of
the land has been established as national parks and preserves.
</P>
<P>
   According to Barletta, 357 varieties of birds have been spotted
in one day by the National Audubon Society in some parts of Panama.
</P>
<P>
   ``Panama has more biodiversity than even Costa Rica, it's just
that few people know about this,'' he said. ``We want to let people
know that, while the canal is the main thing, there's lots to see
here.''

   PANAMA CITY, Panama _ In the Panama Canal, ships are raised like
toys, step by step, through three sets of locks to a height of 85
feet above sea level, on their way from the Atlantic Ocean to the
Pacific and back again.
</P>
<P>
   The vessels are tugged through the locks by ``mules,'' or
electric locomotives on train tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Each passage requires 52 million gallons of fresh water to
equalize the water levels in these locks.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, no pumps are used, meaning that gravity is all
that pulls the swirling water from the surrounding watershed into
the locks' chambers.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 85 years after its completion, these 50 miles of man-made
ditch are still an engineering wonder to behold, and the most
popular tourist attraction in this Ohio-sized country.
</P>
<P>
   The Panama Canal is one of the greatest civil engineering
achievements of this century, which are often referred to as the
Seven Wonders of the Modern World.
</P>
<P>
   The others are the Suez Canal, the Dneproges Dam in Ukraine, the
Alaska-Canada Highway, the Golden Gate Bridge, the Empire State
Building, and the Eifel Tower.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, this S-shaped isthmus has its share of white beaches,
dense rainforests, and colonial architecture.
</P>
<P>
   But so does Panama's better-marketed neighbor to the north,
Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   What Costa Rica doesn't have, of course, is the canal.
</P>
<P>
   Situated between Costa Rica and Colombia, Panama links North and
South America and the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.
</P>
<P>
   The Panama Canal runs northwest to southeast, utilizing locks at
both ends, an existing river and a man-made lake.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the Panamanian government prepares to take control of
the canal and surrounding properties, a massive push has been
launched to attract tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Panama's always been a comfortable place for Americans to visit:
English is widely spoken, tap water is safe for drinking, and the
U.S. dollar is the official currency.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Panama Canal treaties signed in 1977, Panama will take
sole possession not only of the canal on Dec. 31, 1999, but also of
some 250,000 acres of land, along with seven U.S. military bases,
golf courses, movie theaters, airports and other installations
bordering the canal.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism is a giant part of the Panamanian government's plans to
redevelop these properties.
</P>
<P>
   Already underway are projects to build new hotels in the
rainforests and to re-establish passenger service within two years
on the 143-year-old Panama Railway that runs alongside the canal.
</P>
<P>
   Nicolas Ardito Barletta directs the Inter-Oceanic Regional
Authority, the agency charged with overseeing foreign investment in
the converted areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 300 cruise ships passing through the canal every year
but none of them stop because we don't have the facilities to serve
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Panama's biggest goal is to build facilities on both the
Pacific and the Atlantic within five years that can accommodate up
to 250 cruise ships a year.
</P>
<P>
   And, for sure, the passengers on those ships will want to see
the canal.
</P>
<P>
   Today, visitors can see the canal at Miraflores Locks, which
offers an air-conditioned visitors center and an observation deck
where ships can be viewed as they pass through the locks.
</P>
<P>
   By October 1999, construction of a new, three-story visitors
center is due to be finished, complete with a higher observation
deck, as well as a bar, restaurant and interactive game area.
</P>
<P>
   Here, ships look like corks trying to squeeze through the
opening of a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The locks are only 110 feet wide and the biggest ships are 106
feet wide, so there's only two feet of clearance on either side,''
explained Jamie Robleto, a tour guide.
</P>
<P>
   In general, it's easy to see why a French company employing a
small army went bankrupt trying to excavate this huge path in the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   The project was launched in 1882 and ended in disaster seven
years later with over 22,000 people dying from malaria and other
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The United States took over the project in 1903 and finished
construction in 1914.
</P>
<P>
   At Miraflores Locks, a short film in English and a team of
bilingual guides provide visitors with all sorts of canal-related
facts and figures.
</P>
<P>
   For example, more than 13,100 ships traverse the canal each
year, paying tolls based on tonnage and number of passengers
aboard.
</P>
<P>
   The highest toll was $141,344, paid by the Crown Princess Cruise
Ship in 1993. The lowest toll was 36 cents, paid by Richard
Halliburton, who swam the canal in 1928.
</P>
<P>
   Miraflores Locks is just minutes by car from Panama City, the
oldest Spanish settlement on the American mainland which is really
three cities rolled into one.
</P>
<P>
   Stone ruins are all that's left of Panama Vieja, the original
settlement burned in 1671 by pirate Henry Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   In its place is the colonial Casco Viejo, a picturesque section
of the city where white houses with ornamental iron balconies line
winding, narrow streets.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the flashy, modern part of the city, where gleaming
high-rise banks and hotels dot the skyline.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of Panama's 2.8 million people live in and around
Panama City, which sits on the Pacific side of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the canal an easy visit from Panama City, but the
capital is also a good point from which to set off on day-trips to
see the wildlife in the Soberania National Park and in the
rainforest part of the Barro Colorado Nature Monument, which
consists of the 3,800-acre Barro Colorado Island and five adjacent
peninsulas in the man-made Gatun Lake.
</P>
<P>
   In Panama, which boasts large, unspoiled forests, a fourth of
the land has been established as national parks and preserves.
</P>
<P>
   According to Barletta, 357 varieties of birds have been spotted
in one day by the National Audubon Society in some parts of Panama.
</P>
<P>
   ``Panama has more biodiversity than even Costa Rica, it's just
that few people know about this,'' he said. ``We want to let people

 &HT;    A friendly-like day at the post office
 &HT;    By Ernest Murray
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ Like so many others, I headed to the post office
for some one-cent stamps. There's a machine in the foyer where you
can put in a nickel and get five one-cent stamps.
</P>
<P>
   What a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Where else can you buy five items for a nickel?
</P>
<P>
   After making my purchase, I thought it might be a good time to
invest in some 33-cent stamps, as I was there and I had the money
to spare. So, standing in line for the next available clerk, I
admired the pretty red 33-cent stamps in the display case.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I'll get,'' I thought.
</P>
<P>
   Making my way to the next available clerk, the nice lady behind
the counter asked how she could help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take some of those 33-cent stamps. About as many as a $20
bill will buy,'' I said real friendly-like.
</P>
<P>
   The nice lady behind the counter took out three books of stamps
and rang it up, took my $20 bill and handed me two dimes in change
and said have a nice day.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of the pretty red 33-cent stamps, they were
H-stamps.
</P>
<P>
   I said real friendly-like, ``Don't you have any of those pretty
red 33-cent stamps?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry sir,'' the nice lady said. ``We don't have any
33-cent stamps. These H-stamps are all we have.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But you have 33-cent stamps in the display case,'' I said
still trying to sound friendly-like.
</P>
<P>
   ``No sir,'' she said really nicely. ``We don't have any 33-cent
stamps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then those stamps I just saw must be 3.3-cent stamps,'' I said
maybe a little louder and less friendly-like.
</P>
<P>
   So the nice lady behind the counter asked another nice lady
behind the counter if there were any 33-cent stamps.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean those Chinese New Year stamps?'' the other nice lady
said. ``Yeh, we have some, but they're not self-adhesive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 33-cent stamps, but you have to lick them,'' the nice
lady behind the counter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll lick anyone here,'' I said maybe a little louder and
while looking around at the folks who were waiting for me to leave
so they could buy their H-stamps.
</P>
<P>
   By now the line of people had backed up considerably and they
looked ready to take cover behind the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take them,'' I said very quietly.
</P>
<P>
   As I was leaving, the I heard the man behind me say to the nice
lady behind the counter that he wanted some one-cent stamps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are out of one-cent stamps,'' the nice lady behind the
counter said.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't say anything.

 &HT;    Juror charged with taking bribe, money laundering
 &HT;    By Jenny Staletovich
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ To the team trying to defend the notorious Willy Falcon
and Sal Magluta on charges of smuggling 75 tons of cocaine during
the 1980s, the balding Hispanic man sitting in the first seat of
the jury box looked like the perfect juror.
</P>
<P>
   He fit the research, jury expert Sandy Marks said this week. He
was a peer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't that what the jury system is supposed to be, a jury of
your peers? I wanted to get as many peers as I could. And
interestingly enough, he was in juror seat number one and never
moved. It's not like the government wanted him off and we planted
him,'' said Marks, who worked for defense attorney Roy Black.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, no one knew just how much of a peer he was.
</P>
<P>
   In a case that is bizarre even by Miami standards, the juror,
Miguel Moya, 36, was charged with taking a bribe to rig the
verdict, money laundering, tax evasion and witness tampering after
the duo's 1996 acquittal. His parents were charged with helping
him.
</P>
<P>
   The case has opened up the sanctity of the jury room as well as
launch an unusual defense which rests largely on Moya's admission
that he, too, was part of a drug smuggling operation.
</P>
<P>
   Run by his cousin, a former Miami cop, the smuggling business
supplied a sudden $500,000 cash windfall within three months of the
Falcon and Magluta verdict, he claims.
</P>
<P>
   The three-week trial is expected to end this week.
</P>
<P>
   Falcon and Magluta are now serving time on lesser charges. But
the fallout from their case has matched their storied careers:
</P>
<P>
   Several government witnesses were murdered. Their killers were
never found. And U.S. Attorney Kendall Coffey was shamed from
office after a trip to a Miami strip club for solace ended when he
bit a dancer. Coffey denied the charge but quit anyway.
</P>
<P>
   During more than two weeks of testimony in Moya's trial,
prosecutors have built a case on his sudden wealth, a videotape of
him telling an undercover FBI agent, ``this goes down with me,''
and testimony from his wife that he brought home a bag of cash for
his jury work.
</P>
<P>
   The defense refuted the charges with testimony from jurors and,
the most shocking, Moya's cousin.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1995 when Moya was called to jury duty, he was a ramp
operator at Miami International Airport making $55,696, according
to his 1996 tax return. He now says he was laundering money for his
cousin, Ramon ``Ray'' Perez, who was smuggling cocaine from
Colombia through Mexico to Florida. Perez said he paid Moya, his
58-year-old father and his mother, 57, about $550,000 for their
work.
</P>
<P>
   Perez received a 14-year sentence in 1989 and in 1991 shaved off
five years by giving up the names of associates. He did not list
the Moyas at the time, he said, because they were ``family.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors argue Perez is covering for his cousin's sudden
shopping spree that included, among other things, a $198,000 house
in the Keys, a speedboat and $16,000 deposit in a checking account
within three months of the Falcon and Magluta verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Falcon and Magluta, meanwhile, operated in another stratosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The pair were considered among the biggest of the cocaine
cowboys and had amassed a $2 billion fortune smuggling cocaine from
Colombia, federal prosecutors claimed. In 1991 a federal grand jury
handed up a 24-count indictment.
</P>
<P>
   When the trial began, Moya sat in the foreman's seat.
</P>
<P>
   Former jurors testifying in his case say almost immediately Moya
announced his ``reasonable doubt'' and voted against conviction.
During three days of deliberation, he never wavered, they said.
However, Judge James Lawrence King strictly limited what jurors
could testify about, comparing the process to ``uncorking a bottle
of wine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just hope it's a vintage year. Otherwise, we are going
to be drinking a whole lot of bad wine,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal rules strictly limit juror questioning to ``improper''
outside influence or extraneous prejudicial information.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a place in which we need to be very cautious,'' said
DePaul University law professor and jury expert Stephan Landsman.
``They're not always going to be rocket scientists. But if you're
going to have full, robust deliberation, they've got to have a
sense that that doesn't leave the room.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, juror Cynthia Watts said she eventually voted to acquit
Magluta and Falcon because she wanted to end the 4-month trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like the sausage factory. We don't want to see
what goes into it,'' Landsman said.
</P>
<P>
   But when clear evidence exists, juries should be questioned, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Watts testified that Moya was so adamant in his decision that at
one point he and another juror had to be separated. But four other
jurors said he took little part in deliberating and said the
majority favored acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the moral to the story,'' Marks, the jury consultant,
said, ``is if Moya took money, he didn't need to.''
</P>
<P>
   Staff researchers Lynne Palombo and Barbara Gellis Shapiro and
the Associated Press contributed to this story.

 DAMOUR, Lebanon: ... early 1970s.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among Christians, Maronites represent roughly 65 percent of the
total. They take their name from a 4th-century Syrian monk named
St. Maron. The next two largest denominations are Greek Orthodox
and Greek Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   Carved into a steep cliffside outside of Beirut is the seat of
the Maronite patriarchate. Beyond an elegant courtyard, through a
long gallery, sits the Maronite patriarch, Cardinal Nasrallah
Sfeir, in a red satin chair.
</P>
<P>
   The gilded European decor speaks to the historical links between
the Maronites and the West. The French in particular have had a
missionary presence here for centuries and ruled the country
between this century's two world wars. Most Maronites consider
themselves Phoenicians, whose civilization dominated the eastern
Mediterranean for centuries, not Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Christian church has been here from the dawn of
Christianity,'' says Cardinal Sfeir. ``But what we see today is
very sad for us. We see the Christian majority shrink to a
minority. We fear it will shrink even more.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican acknowledges the Maronite flight as a profound
threat to the future of the Catholic Church in the Mideast. Rome
convened a synod on Lebanon prior to a visit by Pope John Paul II
there in May of 1997. The council created a mechanism for
reconciliation between Christians and Muslims, which church
officials consider the first step to rebuilding the country and
staunching the outflow of Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Christians have no confidence, no trust in the future,''
adds Sfeir. ``Many Lebanese would come back if they trusted the
situation. These are very wealthy and very important people for the
strength of this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to find a way,'' he says, ``to bring people back.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Displaced residents slow to return
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Damour, such efforts have failed. The government allocated
$800 million for the return of those displaced by the war. But the
funding has dried up. Christians claim that most of it went to
Muslims. In Damour, most of the construction sites consist of
concrete foundations and nothing more. Some 700 people live in a
town that boasted a prewar population of 30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Antoine Ghafari, the Christian mayor, was elected last May in
the first municipal elections in 35 years. But even he doesn't live
here anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Ghafari lives most of the year in New York, where he is a
corporate lawyer. Like many Christian professionals, Ghafari, 43,
lives abroad but keeps a hand in Lebanese political affairs. He
says he wants to return eventually, but his career keeps him
straddling the two worlds.
</P>
<P>
   He was 20 when the town was invaded. He fought in a small
militia that tried to defend it. He fled and later watched as his
home was destroyed. In 1983, the day after the bombing of the US
Marines barracks in Beirut, he left Lebanon.
</P>

   The product of a wealthy family, Ghafari had the means to attend
the University of Pennsylvania law school. He later clerked for a
federal judge and then built his own law practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to help my people, the Christians, to come back here,''
he says. ``I am a true believer of the human and cultural wealth
that Christianity brings to the Middle East. My belief is that it
must be preserved. There is no civilization in the Mideast without
Christianity.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all Maronites are as dogmatic about their plight. They are
people like Said Akil, 33, who owns a small lunch counter in
Damour. Wearing a shirt with ``USA'' emblazoned on the front and a
crucifix dangling from his neck, Akil works over a hot grill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is leaving. All of my relatives, all of my friends,
any one who can get out, is doing it,'' he says. ``It's got nothing
to do with Muslims. Most of my friends are Muslim. It's that there
is nothing here for us.''
</P>
<P>
   He pulled from a drawer a folder stuffed with documents
supporting a visa application to the United States. His father, who
owns a machine shop next door, looked on sadly as his oldest son
spread out on the formica counter the government forms that he
hopes will become his ticket out of Lebanon.

`The process feeds on itself'
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a posh office building in Beirut, Nehmatalla Abi Nasr, 60, an
influential lawyer, lashed out at his Christian bretheren who
leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Christians leave for opportunity in the West or to get
away from the war,'' he says. ``Then they lose more and more
influence here, and then they are increasingly afraid to return.
The process feeds on itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Nasr sits behind a polished oak desk, fidgeting with his Pierre
Cardin glasses and constantly checking his gold Omega watch. He
retains many powerful clients, including the Maronite patriarchate.
He filed a suit on its behalf against the Hariri government's 1995
program that naturalized some 300,000 Muslims from Syria, Iraq, and
other Arab countries. The move, he says, was coldly calculated to
further marginalize Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are barely holding on here,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement that ended the war, Christians are allocated
half the seats in parliament and maintain a permanent claim to the
presidency. The rest of the legislative body and the office of
prime minister are assigned to Sunni and Shiite Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Political science professor Khazen says Muslims have diluted
this formula. First they shifted executive power to the prime
minister. Then they carved out electoral districts to prevent the
rise of any powerful Christian politicians.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Christian seats fall into the hands of weak
candidates loyal to Syria. The neighboring country effectively
controls Lebanon with some 35,000 troops stationed here with the
compliance of the government. Christians have compounded their
problems by boycotting the elections. The net result is that
Hezbollah made a strong showing in the May municipal elections,
securing a power base in Beirut's southern suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Christians have clung to their role in business, academic
institutions, and medicine. But in politics, they are losing. And
they are losing dramatically,'' says Khazen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will this political marginalization erode Lebanon's uniquely
pluralistic society? My sense is it will,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   The November funeral of George Saade, 67, leader of Lebanon's
Phalange Party, the largest Maronite political entity, symbolized
the end of the dominant role Christians have played in government.
Maronites had been critical of Saade for surrendering too much
power to Muslims during the peace talks that ended the war.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the aging men gathered at the funeral at the party's
headquarters in Beirut were involved in some of the war's more
brutal attacks on Muslims. The most famous of the Phalangist
massacres occurred in 1982 in the Sabra and Shatilla refugee camps
in Israeli-occupied West Beirut. More than 400 Palestinians were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   Jad Nehmeh, a member of the party's political bureau and a
former Phalange fighter, said, ``Christians feel they are governed
by Muslims now. This funeral gives us all the feeling of the end of
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Nehmeh was asked about claims that the Christians are
responsible for their own fate. He was asked if Phalange atrocities
such as those at Sabra and Shatilla did not contribute to the
Christian disenfranchisement.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not true. That's Palestinian propaganda,'' he angrily
replied, referring to the Palestinian forces that fought alongside
Muslim forces in the civil war. ``The Christians were the governors
of this country. They had no interest in causing a war. The
Palestinians were radicals who wanted to destabilize the country.
We are the ones who tried to save it.''
</P>
<P>
   While the history of the war is debatable, the outcome is not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see fundamentalist groups from Iran and Libya with open
access to power here,'' says Nasr. ``It threatens democracy in
Lebanon. I don't fear that this could happen. It is happening.''
</P>
<P>
   In the poor neighborhood of Haret H'reik in the south of Beirut,
Hezbollah flags depicting a fist holding a machine gun high over
the city are everywhere. Militant Islamists with beards and prayer
caps and women in Islamic robes and black veils crowd the streets.
</P>
<P>
   There are no movie theaters here. No bars. Instead,
billboard-sized murals of the late Iranian Ayatollah Khomeini's
disapproving face loom on street corners. What was once a Christian
neighborhood is now firmly in the grip of Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   Sheikh Atta, an intense and articulate Hezbollah leader, runs
the Shiite Muslim group's press office here. He is quick to point
out that Hezbollah is the only major political party that did not
fight other Lebanese. Founded in 1982, its goal is to resist
Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Christian fears of Hezbollah's surging
puritanical influence, Atta replies, ``Yes, we would like to make
an Islamic state. But only as long as 90 percent of the Lebanese
people agree, and not by force but by conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   He questions the Christian perspective that Hezbollah's rise
threatens Lebanon's unique character.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's never been a chance for Islam to bring its
accomplishments, its civilization, its culture and tolerance here.
Now we are doing that,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   One of Lebanon's premiere historians and authors, Kamal Salibi,
a Christian, says that Hezbollah's attractive mix of social justice
and resistance has strong appeal to young Muslims. This is why it
is feared by both Christians and secular Muslims. Despite the
influence of the fundamentalists, the vast majority of Lebanese
Muslims are secular.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are terrified by the emergence of Islamic clericalism, so
they have an umbilical attachment to the Christians as the
preservers of secular government and more importantly a secular way
of life,'' says Salibi. ``The secular Muslims say, `Don't leave us
alone against this monster that threatens our lives, our ability to
have a drink at a bar, to watch movies, to have a culture we want.'
''
</P>
<P>
   This threat to Lebanon's modern secular identity is evident on
Christian college campuses, where the current generation knows only
conflict between the two faiths.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Nahme, 22, who is completing a business degree, says,
``There is little economic opportunity here, so I would like to go
to America.''
</P>
<P>
   His friend, Eler Sadek, 22, stamps out a Marlboro and adds,
``Yeah, and there are too many Muslims.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds, ``They are rearranging the country. I feel like a
stranger here. This is not even Lebanon anymore. They (Muslims) are
killing this country. If I could get a visa to America, I'd be
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The road north out of Beirut winds through a landscape of
bombed-out ruins mixed with shiny new American fast-food
restaurants and European clothing boutiques. One hundred and
twenty-five miles north of Beirut is the Kadisha Valley, home of
the ancient Maronites and the rugged terrain that yielded their
modern warlords. At the end of the 7th century, as Islam spread
through the region, the Maronites retreated here to fortress-like
monasteries carved into the cliffs. They remained isolated from the
rest of the world until the Crusades, when the Maronites joined the
Roman Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon, the cavernous Virgin of the Qanubbin
Gorge Church and living quarters here seem abandoned. But inside, a
faint sound of coughing could be heard down a long hallway. Sister
Mary Agnes, who would not give her age except to say she had been a
nun for 60 years, tended a frail, bedridden sister. The two nuns
were the only people living in the huge, unheated building where
100 clerics once resided.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Mary was blithely uninterested in the exodus of
Christians. Her serene face broke into a smile as she said,
``Wherever there is life, there is Christ. There is no need for us
to worry.''

 &HT;    Champion of term limits and I&AMP;R is persistent
 &HT;    (ATTN: Texas eds.)
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Sen. Jane Nelson is persistent. The Republican
from Flower Mound has championed term limits and initiative and
referendum for years.
</P>
<P>
   And even though her Republican Party of Texas now opposes rather
than supports I&AMP;R, as it is called, and is neutral on term limits,
Nelson is still pursuing what most Texas legislative observers
think is an impossible dream.
</P>
<P>
   One proposed constitutional amendment by Nelson would limit
legislators to a maximum of 12 years in the House and 12 in the
Senate. Another would set up I&AMP;R, which would give voters the right
to petition to put matters directly on the ballot, circumventing
the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was elected, I talked a lot about the need for term
limits,'' Nelson said. ``And of course, I haven't changed my
feelings on that. I found very quickly that states which had
imposed term limits did not do it by the Legislature voting to
limit their terms, but did it through the I&AMP;R process. It's really
where I first became familiar with initiative and referendum.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.S. Term Limits Coalition, 21 states have term
limits. Of those, all but Louisiana adopted them through initiative
and referendum. Twenty-four states have I&AMP;R.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe if we were to have initiative powers in Texas, one
of the first issues that would come before the voters would be term
limits,'' Nelson said. ``I'm not overly optimistic,'' she added
with a chuckle, ``that either of those bills is going to pass. But
I still believe that Texans deserve initiative powers.''
</P>
<P>
   Truly, fat chance. Nelson's Senate colleague, Democrat Ken
Armbrister of Victoria, offered a term limits bill in 1995. Got
nowhere, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there were those who suspected that Armbrister
introduced the measure simply so a Democrat, rather than a
Republican, would have control of the issue. Predictably, it died.
</P>
<P>
   But, Armbrister points out, Nelson did not even request a
hearing for her term limits bill in 1997. She did bring her I&AMP;R
proposal up that year for a hearing before the State Affairs
Committee Armbrister chairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The votes were not there to pass it out of committee,''
Armbrister said, with his own chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   He said proponents have been unable to explain two problems: how
to control bureaucracies if legislators, but not bureaucrats, have
term limits; and how to keep legislators responsible to their
constituents in their final term.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you (protect against the fact) that they realize it's
their last term, so why should they do anything for anybody?''
Armbrister asked. ``And that's the inherent problems with the
issues that none of the witnesses could ever provide an answer for.
And that's basically where they fall apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson argued without success on the floor of the Republican
State Convention in 1996 when the party reversed its stand on I&AMP;R.
</P>
<P>
   ``We oppose any attempt to introduce direct democracy (I&AMP;R) into
our state constitution thereby bypassing the legislative process,
and the checks and balances between the executive, legislative and
judicial branches of government,'' the party's platform now says.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the concern of the GOP infrastructure, now strongly
influenced at its state level by the Christian Coalition, is that
I&AMP;R could lead to legalized casino gambling in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats _ and legislators _ oppose I&AMP;R not just because
it undercuts the Legislature, but also because it can put some
wacky and contentious ideas before voters. Some Californians have
come to call I&AMP;R the ``Political Consultants' Full Employment Act''
because it generates so much business for those employed to pass or
defeat initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   As for term limits, the Republican desire for them in the 1980s
has weakened since Republicans gained power in Washington and Texas
in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The state party has no position on term limits, spokesman Robert
Black says. ``That is something for the individuals to decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said she isn't fazed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't changed my feelings at all,'' she maintained. ``And
I've talked to a lot of Republicans who still feel very strongly
this is something the people of Texas should have.''
</P>
<P>
   Chances for passage?
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't done any head count,'' she admitted. ``The makeup of
the Senate has not changed significantly, and I unfortunately was
not able to get it out last session.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' she mused with yet another chuckle. ``Maybe
some people have seen the light since last session. We'll see.''

 &HT;    Public schools must give parents enrollment options
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Across the country, urban school districts are
calling the buses back. Forced integration is going the way of
Space Food Sticks and Nehru jackets: out.
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhood schools are in, even if some of those schools are
as segregated as before 1954.
</P>
<P>
   That fact was accented recently when Waco's elementaries did
Christmas performances on the school district's cable TV channel.
In more than one choir of angels, nary an Anglo was to be found.
</P>
<P>
   So be it, communities have declared.
</P>
<P>
   There's much to be said for neighborhood schools as an
alternative to busing, particularly in the potential for walk-in
parental involvement and the re-establishing of communal
identities. All things equal, it's right to let children attend the
school nearest them.
</P>
<P>
   But with the shift to neighborhood schools and changes in
attendance policies, districts risk putting all of their eggs in
that basket and forfeiting something many urban districts have been
doing right: giving parents choice within the district.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to vocal parents and a few school trustees who would
listen, Waco has fought off the impulse to discontinue
self-integrated magnet schools, though two elementary magnet
programs were displaced as their original campuses became
predominantly black neighborhood schools.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of magnet schools should expect to have to fight for
them because, simply, magnet schools don't compute for agents of
retro-creep. For the retros, it is good enough to put everyone in
his or her box. Draw rigid attendance zones like in the old days
and be done with it.
</P>
<P>
   With a new inner-city middle school coming up, the Waco
Independent School District has prepared attendance zones for
``neighborhood'' middle schools _ a term that in some cases is a
stretch because one's school might be miles away. Though some
parents might be satisfied as zone feeders, others want to choose _
not just between their nearest school and Waco's magnet middle
school, G.W. Carver Academy, but from among all of them.
</P>
<P>
   They should have that choice. The administration is pledging to
accommodate that choice as space permits.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is _ the words of school-voucher con artists to the
con-trary (cq) _ parents in this district and in Texas are
conditioned to have choices. Last year roughly a third of Waco's
students attended schools outside of their attendance areas, either
at magnets or on campuses to which they had transferred.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, last year 176,000 students transferred to public
schools within their districts, and 48,000 to public schools
outside their districts.
</P>
<P>
   Ysleta ISD, Greater El Paso's second-largest district, has drawn
raves for a virtual open-enrollment policy. Yes, it has attendance
zones. But five years ago it announced an open enrollment policy
encouraging transfers, space permitting, and sparking among its
schools a rollicking joust, each seeking to become the school of
choice in El Paso. Later Ysleta opened enrollment to students
outside the district. Last year it admitted more than 2,000
imports.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is to say to the proposition of ``school choice''
(commonly abused to mean diverting public dollars to private and
religious schools) that public schools have a rejoinder on which
they can capitalize if they will think out of the box. Magnet
schools and wide-open enrollment policies have proven to blunt
flight from urban districts and to give some people the same vested
feeling of ownership in their campuses that one would hope comes to
bear on neighborhood schools.
</P>
<P>
   In his State of the Union address, President Clinton cited
choice within public schools (no, not vouchers) as a national goal.
This is how government should fund competition, not by siphoning
tax dollars out of the system. School districts have learned that
families that otherwise would opt out will opt in with
open-enrollment policies and magnetic designs.

 &HT;    Cross-license teams up big-name wrestlers, WB cartoon characters
 &HT;    By Jim Bohman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ If a colorful T-shirt with wrestling's Bill
Goldberg snarling at Yosemite Sam is something you gotta have, hang
on, it's coming.
</P>
<P>
   Littlefield, Adams &AMP; Co., a Huber Heights T-shirt imprinter that
supplies Wal-Mart, Kmart and Target, has signed cross licensing
agreements that will make such eye-catching shirts possible.
</P>
<P>
   The agreements with World Championship Wrestling, a long-time
client, and Warner Brothers' Looney Tunes are a first for
Littlefield, Adams, which produces decorative apparel.
</P>
<P>
   World Championship Wresting T-shirts were a major contributor to
Littlefield, Adams' $25 million in 1998 sales, according to Warren
Rawls, chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   The agreements cover men's and boy's T-shirts, sweatshirts,
shooter shirts and long sleeve shirts, said Michael Balber, chief
executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are thrilled to be back with Warner Brothers and believe
this cross-license will allow us to create humorous, more light
hearted portrayals of wrestling using Taz (the Tasmanian Devil),
Bugs Bunny and other Looney Tunes characters which are instantly
recognizable by the consumer,'' Balber said. ``Combining these two
famous properties produces merchandise which appeals to consumers
in a very broad age range.''
</P>
<P>
   Balber said the new T-shirts will be in mass merchandise stores
around the end of February.

 AL KOSHEH, Egypt: ... for four years.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Islamic militant group Gama Islamiya began targeting Copts
in 1991, when it launched a terrorist campaign to overthrow the
secular government of Hosni Mubarak, which responded with a
relentless crackdown that imprisoned 20,000 militants. Still,
occasionally spectacular atrocities continue to occur, such as the
massacre of 58 foreign tourists in Luxor in November 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Muslim extremists' 8-year battle against the
government, militants have chosen Copts as easy and repeated
targets. Militants firebombed churches and gunned down Copts
working in the wheat and sugar cane fields along the Nile. Perhaps
the most dramatic case occurred on Feb. 12, 1997, in Abu Qurqas, a
small town on a wide bend in the Nile River in upper Egypt near
Minya. While a Coptic student prayer group was gathering in St.
George's Church, gunmen whom police believe to have been Gama
Islamiya militants opened fire, killing nine people.
</P>
<P>
   The church now has armed guards stationed at a steel gate that
leads to its courtyard. On a recent visit, a reporter was permitted
to enter the town only with an armored troop carrier flanked by six
soldiers carrying automatic rifles.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, Emad, 28, an accountant and youth leader of the church,
suspiciously eyes the security officials who appeared in the
church. The plaster walls of the church are pockmarked with bullet
holes. Framed photographs of the nine young faces of the victims
adorn the walls with the faces of ancient martyrs.
</P>
<P>
   Coptic churches are always filled with images of persecution and
martyrdom, first at the hands of the Romans, then by the
Byzantines, and later Arab Muslims. Copts define their history in
epochs of suffering, such as the 3rd century ``Age of Martyrdom''
and the 7th century ``Era of Great Tribulations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The killers came in here, right here, and opened fire,'' said
Emad. ``Our brothers and sisters were killed while they prayed.
They are martyrs.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the relationship between Muslims and Christians
in Egypt, Emad retreated into an uncomfortable silence.
</P>
<P>
   The militants have also targeted wealthy Copts. A recent spate
of robberies of Coptic jewelry stores is believed to have been a
key source of financing for the Gama Islamiya. And Copts complain
they must pay ``gezia,'' a kind of protection tax, which Islamists
say is grounded in Koranic law. Copts who have resisted have been
threatened with death. Some have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   The story of one Christian family from Abu Qurqas in upper Egypt
is a dramatic example. Rif'at, who asked that his last name not be
used, said that for eight years his family faced threats and
ultimately murder by Islamic militants. They burned the family's
general store when they refused to pay.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Rif'at's brother was shot to death by militants. Most
of the family has fled to Cairo, and parents are trying to send
their children to America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fear for our lives every day. Only because we are
Christians,'' wrote Rif'at in a letter documenting the case.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian officials point out that Christians are not the only
targets of Islamic militants. Tourists, police officers, prominent
secular journalists, and politicians have also been slaughtered by
militants.
</P>
<P>
   But in Al Kosheh, the problem was the government, not the
militants. This is why the case there resonates so powerfully among
Copts.
</P>
<P>
   Based on dozens of interviews with victims, police ran roughshod
over the Christian part of town from the morning the bodies were
found last Aug. 15 through to the end of September.
</P>
<P>
   Victims claim that police threatened to rape several women. They
described in chilling detail being subjected to electric prods, of
being hung from window grates and in some cases a ceiling fan for
hours during questioning. Evidence of rope burns, bruises, and
small red scars from the prods were visible on the bodies of more
than a dozen victims interviewed by the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   Boctur Abu Yameen, 60, was the first arrested as a suspect. He
said the police also detained members of his family, including his
11-year-old son and 12-year-old daughter, who were threatened and
beaten while police tried to force them to confess that their
father was the killer. Yameen was held for 34 days without any
formal charges before he was eventually released.
</P>
<P>
   ``They began shocking my ears first, and then I was stripped and
the prods were placed on my genitals,'' he said. ``They said things
I cannot repeat about the Lord Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   A Copt, William Artori, has been convicted of the murder and is
sentenced to death. The church and human rights activists say
Artori was wrongly accused and that the only two witnesses against
him were tortured into making statements that they have since
recanted. The five Muslim men whom the Christians suspect of
carrying out the murder _ one of whom is reportedly a relative of a
high-ranking officer in Egypt's intelligence agency _ were briefly
questioned and remain free.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian government has found no wrongdoing by police,
according to press reports. Officials say claims of torture were
exaggerated and that they have convicted the right man.
</P>
<P>
   Osama El Baz, a senior adviser to president Mubarak, adamantly
denies that Christians face discrimination. In an interview in his
elegant Cairo office, El Baz cited Egypt's ``proud history of
religious tolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I confess that the Copts are claiming they are treated
unfairly as a minority, but they are wrong,'' said El Baz.
</P>
<P>
   El Baz typifies to many Copts the Cairene elite whom they
consider dismissive and largely ignorant of the difficulties they
face as a religious minority, especially in the more lawless
reaches of upper Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   El Baz believes the case has attracted interest because of an
orchestrated effort by conservative American Christian groups and
Washington lobbyists for the Israeli government to draw attention
to the ``persecution'' of Christians in many Muslim countries and
China.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the crusade has been Michael Horowitz, a senior fellow
at the Hudson Institute and a former Reagan administration
official. He, along with conservative Christians, successfully
lobbied for passage last year of the US Freedom From Religious
Persecution Act, which can carry economic sanctions for any country
that violates it.
</P>
<P>
   As an American ally receiving $2 billion a year in aid, Egypt
has been targeted by Washington activists as a potential violator
of this law because of its treatment of Copts. This has infuriated
the Egyptian government. Even prominent Copt leaders, such as Yusef
Boutros-Ghali, Egypt's finance minister and the son of the former
United Nations chief Boutros Boutros-Ghali, have been critical of
the new American law. The younger Boutros-Ghali has said it could
in fact intensify discrimination against Copts.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Critics say law being used as wedge
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Secular Muslim critics, such as the director of Cairo's Al Ahram
Strategic Center, Abdel Monem Said Ally, see the new American law
as a shameless attempt to foster divisions between Christians and
Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are American forces tied to Israel who are intent on
demonizing Islam and hurting the interests of the Arab world,''
said El Baz.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, a report by the respected Egyptian Organization
for Human Rights found that the Al Kosheh case ``constituted grave
violations of the rights, freedoms, and human dignity of the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   In an October interview, the group's secretary general, Hafez
Abu Seda, qualified his findings: ``Police brutality is widespread
against Muslims and Christians, even if this is an exceptionally
dramatic case. Systematic police brutality. . .has been an issue
for all of Egypt.''
</P>
<P>
   Still Seda, who is Muslim, sharply criticized the government for
doing too little to respond to the events in Al Kosheh. His
criticisms of the government landed him in one of Egypt's worst
prisons in the weeks after the Globe interviewed him. The
government charged that his report was an ``act harmful to Egypt.''
The International Commission of Jurists has come to his defense,
calling his detention ``an attempt to silence the voice of a major
and internationally recognized human rights group.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Egyptian government is in fact trying to silence those
who speak out against police brutality, it is not working in Al
Kosheh. On a Sunday afternoon last fall at the Church of the Angel,
the Christian families of Al Kosheh gathered in the courtyard
behind a huge steel gate. Some 400 angry parishioners clamored to
tell a reporter their stories of torture, arbitrary arrest, and
vicious attacks on their faith by police.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police want us to be afraid. They don't want anyone to
know what is happening here,'' said Shawki Shenouda, 59, who added
that he spent 10 days detained and tortured by police.
</P>
<P>
   As he warily eyed police officers stationed in front of the
church, he whispered, ``But we're not afraid.''

 &HT;    Updike still intrigues with Bech tales
 &HT;    By Jay Milner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've been a fan of John Updike's since, oh, way back when I read
``Rabbit, Run'' in the early 1960s. I read and enjoyed ``The
Centaur,'' enjoyed it and was provoked by it. Was titillated and
stimulated to deep thoughts by ``Couples,'' happy when ``Rabbit
Redux'' hit the book stores. And so on, as Updike continued to
produce thought-provoking and enjoyable books and short stories
that often ran first in The New Yorker, then came out in hardback
collections.
</P>
<P>
   But I had not read either of the Bech books that came in the
1970s. Apparently I was very busy in the '70s. I know I was worn
out in the '80s, although I did read Updike's ``Rabbit at Rest''
that came out in 1990. I wanted to find out if Rabbit was as weary
as I was. And in 1992 I took a stab at his strange novel ``Memories
of the Ford Administration.'' I took a stab at it, but never
finished it and don't recall at this moment what it was about,
although I don't think it had much to do with Gerry Ford or his
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Then along came ``Bech at Bay,'' (Knopf) my man Updike's latest.
I tried it a couple of times before I finally, at the urging of a
friend, stuck with it long enough to do it justice. And I'm very
glad I did. It's an...well, what's the word? ...intriguing book.
Yes, that's the word, intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   And I mean intriguing in the best way; not ambiguous, although
it is ambiguous in a manner of speaking, and not intriguing as a
snake or bad highway smash up might be intriguing. An Updike novel
these days, in point of fact, isn't easy to categorize, or explain,
and certainly not easy to summarize, although he does tell a good
story. It's just not your usual kind of story.
</P>
<P>
   What I'm getting at, or trying to get at, is that Updike is
still as much fun and as thought provoking as he was back when he
was telling stories about Rabbit and his much more familiar
adventures at home and work. Rabbit, if you recall, was just like
so many good old Texas boys who moved up in society by being a star
athlete in high school and marrying a local rich girl and going to
work for her dad.
</P>
<P>
   But Bech is a very different animal. He is at home in Manhattan,
a famous writer _ at least by the time we get to ``Bech at Bay''
who hates critics and is dangerously competitive with his fellow
writers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bech at Bay'' is really five short stories starring Bech in
his latter years. ``Bech in Czech'' finds Bech in Czechoslovakia as
a visiting famous author who, despite his advanced age, still
attracts young writing groupies and still responds to that
attraction.
</P>
<P>
   In the other segments, Bech is persuaded to be presiding officer
of a Manhattan group comprised of aging writers, poets, artists,
and musicians who see themselves as too good for, well, all other
writers, poets, artists and musicians. It develops that he is
presiding over the groups demise, since they are too arrogant to
agree to nominate any new members.
</P>
<P>
   Then Bech, along with his youthful female companion of the
moment, sets out to eliminate all critics he hates, which is just
about all critics. The schemes he cooks up to kill them, or drive
them to suicide are, as bad as it sounds, hilarious.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Bech is awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature and goes
to Sweden to receive his prize and deliver his Nobel speech.
Meantime, he has become a new father, which leads to a surprise
ending to this chapter in Bech's fulsome life.
</P>
<P>
   My advice to you, if you love books, is to hang in there with
Updike's latest Bech adventures until you find yourself hooked, as
I did. It's not an easy read, not in the early stages anyhow, but
it's worth the effort.

   &UR; As the the 2,000th anniversary of Jesus's birth approaches,
millions of Christian tourists are preparing to flock to the Holy
Land to explore their biblical heritage. But beneath this tourism
bonanza is a sad truth: Arab Christians are making an exodus from
their homelands in staggering numbers. In a three-part report Globe
Mideast correspondent Charles M. Sennott examines the situation in
Egypt, Israel, the Palestinian territory, and Lebanon. &LR;

<P>
   CHRISTIANS-II (Al Kosheh, Egypt) _ Egypt's Coptic community is

   CHRISTIANS-III (Damour, Lebanon) _ With roots stretching back to
the 5th century, the Maronite monasteries of Lebanon are hauntingly

 &HT;    The doctor is on: `Frasier' working again after layoff
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Frasier Crane's living room is surprisingly down at
the heels. Maybe it was that recent period of unemployment, but the
carpet, which barely shows up on TV, is scuffed and threadbare, and
there are a couple of unsightly holes hidden behind the couch.
</P>
<P>
   The black Steinway baby grand that sits upstage is pitted along
some surfaces. If you open that bathroom door off the entry,
there's a pile of rubble over to the side.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's dad Martin's armchair smack in the middle,
but that's supposed to be fabulously ratty. Up close it is even
more of a horror than it looks on Thursday nights to the viewing
audience, a monstrous pattern of olive, rust and blue-gray.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this isn't what you expect from the lavishly decorated
living quarters of the fastidious Dr. Frasier Crane.
</P>
<P>
   The show as well has picked up a few nicks and scrapes in recent
months, as Frasier's long layoff seemed to turn off a lot of fans.
At the same time, the show moved into the ``Seinfeld'' time slot,
and while it increased its own ratings, it couldn't measure up to
the hallowed last season of Jerry's gang.
</P>
<P>
   And to top it off, ``Frasier's'' creators were dividing their
energies, working on their NBC sitcom ``Encore! Encore!'' With that
show's disastrous flameout, they're back on ``Frasier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it was very funny to see him out of work,'' says series
star Kelsey Grammer, standing at the front of the stage, dressed in
his own clothes: khakis, a yellow V-neck sweater.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that quality of desperation that was there made people
feel a little claustrophobic. I think what happened was, it became
a little more difficult to look at Frasier with a sense of humor
when he was obviously suffering so much. There was something sort
of sad about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In retrospect, maybe he shouldn't have stayed out of work so
long.''
</P>
<P>
   The cast has just come down to the set after a table reading of
the latest script. David Hyde Pierce, who plays Frasier's even
fussier brother, Niles, takes a slightly different tack in tackling
the problem than Grammer does, just as Niles would with Frasier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a fascinating complaint, which is not true in any
way, that the show's not as good,'' Pierce says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't buy that. I think people have a real investment in
that character.'' (Pierce is wearing a very un-Nileslike plaid
lumberjack shirt and has a heavy 5 o'clock shadow.)
</P>
<P>
   It should come as no surprise that John Mahoney, who plays the
brothers' gruff ex-cop dad, Martin, is the most blunt of the
actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started out the season on the wrong foot. It was dark and
depressing.'' Spoken just as Marty would.
</P>
<P>
   But Mahoney continues his point. ``It still wasn't a bad show.
Even the shows that aren't our best are still better than most
shows on television. They say, `You lost 25 percent of the
``Seinfeld'' audience.' Well, that still doesn't make us a bad
show.''
</P>
<P>
   Even ``Frasier's'' doldrums were pretty decent doldrums, in
other words. And there's a lot of agreement among fans (and the
cast) that by the Christmas episode, in which Frasier pretended to
be Jewish to fool his girlfriend's mother (only to have Niles walk
in dressed as Jesus for a Christmas pageant), the show was back on
track.
</P>
<P>
   It's a track that's given ``Frasier'' an unprecedented five
straight Emmys as best comedy series in its five years on the air.
And the half-full chardonnay glass way of looking at the ratings is
that its audience is up 27 percent from last season, boosting it
from No. 13 on Nielsen's overall list to No. 3 (behind ``ER'' and
``Friends'').
</P>
<P>
   Grammer says he foresees ``Frasier'' running another five years,
giving the series 10 seasons. With the years he played the
psychiatrist on ``Cheers,'' that would give him 19 years as the
same character, even though it's a character that has changed
dramatically since he was introduced on ``Cheers'' as Diane
Chambers' pathetically smitten shrink.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frasier is a luxury to play because the people know the
character so well that they laugh almost with anticipation,'' says
Grammer. ``We always know when Frasier walks into a roomful of
delicate objects that something's going to go down, but the
audience delights in watching how it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, when Frasier finally returned to his job as a call-in
psychiatrist on Seattle radio station KACL, it was a welcome
moment, says Peri Gilpin, who plays his producer, Roz.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we walked back into the booth, Kelsey went, `Aah,''' she
says, sighing dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I went, `Aah.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to be back.''

   William A. Williams Jr. is a former member of the Mormon Church,
which is known for its detailed collection of genealogical
information, and a former actuary, familiar with small but vital
details about populations. So perhaps it figures that he has become
the Internet's sovereign of citation and ruler of reference, the
man who posted the Concordances of Great Books, an online
searchable index of 86 authors and 200 full texts.
</P>
<P>
   Dickensians as far away as Japan send him kudos for his Web
site, at www.concordance.com. And they are far from the only
intense users of Williams' works. If you care to find out where in
the works of Shakespeare the word incardine appears, want to know

exactly Walt Whitman sang the body electric, you can plug in a word

</P>
<P>
   The site, which first appeared on the Web in June 1998, grew out
of an electronic conversation Williams had with a man on the
alt.religion.mormon newsgroup. The man wanted to study the
occurrence of various words in the Bible, the Book of Mormon and
several other texts to see if one of those books had evolved from
others.
</P>
<P>
   It took Williams a few months to teach himself the Perl
programming language and write a program for creating concordances.
(Created primarily for searching religious texts, concordances are
also used for legal depositions and in business.)
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to process files to create index files, several for
each book,'' Williams said. ``And they kind of reference each other
in such a way that you can pull out the occurrences of words very
quickly, 500 references in a second or two. The biggest job is
getting the text files into a form where you can use it. A lot have
junky stuff in it, like hyphens at the end of lines. That's a big
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the works indexed on his page are no longer under
copyright and were obtained from the Project Gutenberg and Books on
Line electronic libraries. Williams got permission from publishers
to put up some of the Mormon-related texts he offers that are not
yet in the public domain. His Web-site host, Primegen Internet
Labs, is generous with space on its server and charges him about
$500 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't do this to make money, but to have something
to do, and hopefully create something to benefit others,'' said
Williams, 61, who is retired and lives with his wife, Ruth, in
Bloomfield Hills, Mich., north of Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Williams himself favors English authors, particularly Austen,
Dickens and Shakespeare. Still, his favorite book is ``Les
Miserables,'' by Victor Hugo. Books by all four authors appear on
his site.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the average number of hits per day, the most popular
stops on the site are Mark Twain (about 18 hits), Charles Dickens
(24), Jane Austen (11), the LDS (Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints) Research page (13) and the Bible (5). Euripides
has also racked up many visits. Kenneth W. Starr has fared less
well, and Williams is thinking of dropping his report for lack of
interest.
</P>
<P>
   The page also provides visitors with links to the North American
Kant Association and the Sherlockian Holmes pages, among other
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Williams' collection, concordance software turns up on an
eclectic variety of Web sites. Bleary-eyed college students can
find both mentions of the word peach in the collected poems of T.S.
Eliot (www.missouri.edu/(tilde)tselist/cgi/tsebase.cgi.
</P>
<P>
   Recovering alcoholics can search for heartache, hangovers,
holidays and havoc in ``The Big Book,'' published by Alcoholics

NAZARETH: ... PULLING APART.``  

</HEADLINE>
   TAKE-BOS
<TEXT>
<P>
   Christians tell of small, sporadic incidents. Muslim teenagers
recently threw stones at a Franciscan priest in traditional brown
robes leading a tour of pilgrims. A young woman driving with a
crucifix hanging from the rear-view mirror was stopped by Muslim
teenagers, who smashed the car's window and called her an
``infidel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Christians here are living in fear,'' says the Rev. Quirico
Calella, an Italian Catholic priest who for 23 years was the
director of Terra Santa High School in Nazareth. ``So many,
especially the young men, prefer to simply leave. The reasons for
decades have been economic hardship caused by Israel. But I think
increasingly there is a sense of fatigue. They are tired of being
caught in the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   These tensions have also surfaced outside Nazareth in the
rolling hills of the Galilee, a patchwork of green and brown wheat
fields where a young Jesus wandered. Set among these fields is the
village of Turan.
</P>
<P>
   Violence between Muslims and Christians exploded here last April
25, the Orthodox Good Friday, when a group of young Muslim men
burst into the Roman Catholic Church and disrupted services.
Clashes between Christians and Muslims ensued in the streets.
Muslims firebombed five Christian houses and seven cars. A
23-year-old Christian art student, Sallah Sa'alme, was stabbed to
death in a Muslim ambush. A local Muslim was charged with the
killing.
</P>
<P>
   The violence has continued to simmer over the last year. The
home of the Rev. Basselius Houri of the Roman Catholic Church has
been fired upon at least three times in recent months. Two bullet
holes are visible in a kitchen window.
</P>
<P>
   Community leaders have tried to downplay the incidents as a war
between clans. But Houri says, ``This is religious hatred, and
Israel does nothing to stop it. We live in fear.''
</P>
<P>

Christians anxious under Palestinian rule
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Within the area on the West Bank controlled by the Palestinian
Authority, the historic peace process begun in 1993 has given hope
for Christian and Muslim Palestinians alike that they may soon have
their own independent state. Gaza and less than one-third of the
West Bank currently fall under full or partial control of the
Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   But for Christians who endured occupation and fought alongside
Muslims in the intifadah, life under the Palestinian Authority has
been marbled with anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian Christians cite fears of institutional
discrimination in the Palestinian Authority, which has adopted
Islam as its ``official religion.'' In shaping the ``basic law'' of
the new authority, the legislators relied on ``sharia,'' or the
laws codified in the Koran. Many Christian Palestinians feel
isolated amid what they see as a creeping influence of Islam within
the new government.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Palestinian Christian leaders cite land laws that
prescribe the death penalty for selling land to Jews. This law is
often interpreted by Palestinians in the street as preventing
Muslims from selling to any non-Muslims, including Christians. This
misinterpretation has gained currency because of the preachings of
radical Muslim sheikhs who refer to all non-Muslims as
``infidels.''
</P>
<P>
   But most of the feelings of discrimination are subtle,
Christians say. Ghada Mansour, 29, a former producer of a news show
on the authority-controlled Voice of Palestine radio, says a news
director told her that Christian names should not be included in
obituaries read on the air. And on another occasion, several
colleagues acted shocked and demeaning toward her when she told
them she was Christian.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere, she says, contributed to her decision to leave
her job. Another woman who is a nurse in a health clinic was told
she should not wear a necklace with a crucifix because she might
``offend'' some Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian Authority President Arafat has actively condemned
religious intolerance. He has long cultivated Christian support for
the Palestinian cause and frequently invokes references to the
church spires of the Old City along with the minarets when he
speaks of reclaiming Jerusalem as the capital of a future
Palestinian state. His wife is Christian.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent Arab Christians have been in the vanguard of the
region's nationalist and secular democratic movements. One of them
is Palestinian legislator Hanan Ashrawi. She expressed disappoint
that Arafat, like Netanyahu, has bowed to religious extremist
forces within his government.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sense that this is the language of the day,'' she
says. ``One political force has to prove it's more fundamentalist
than the next. And then suddenly the parameters of political debate
are drawn along religious lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashrawi adamantly denies that there is any persecution of
Christians under the Palestinian Authority despite ``deliberate
attempts by Israel to create this impression.''
</P>
<P>
   She is, however, concerned about recent reports of perceived
Christian discrimination. And she is ``troubled'' about the rising
influence of Hamas, the militant Islamic organization, on the
shaping of the new Palestinian authority.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Bethlehem's shrinking Christian population
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bethlehem's steep hills lead up to the Bassilica of the Nativity
on Manger Square, where Christ was believed to have been born.
Today, the square is under massive reconstruction in preparation
for ``Bethlehem 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor, Hanna Nasser, says the occasion is tinged with
sadness for Christians like him, who've seen Bethlehem's Christians
go from a 95 percent majority to a 35 percent minority over the
last 50 years. Half of his family has emigrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is sad to see the Christian character of the place where
the Lord Jesus was born disappearing,'' he says. ``But we should
not blame this on rising Muslim fundamentalism. The historical fact
that precipitated an exodus of Christians was the creation of the
state of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have confiscated land around Bethlehem, most of it
Christian, to build Jewish settlements,'' he continues. ``And when
the Israeli military closed off our access to East Jerusalem, they
cut off the lifeblood of our economy. We have 30 percent
unemployment and a per capita annual income below $1,000. That is
why Christians leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Giacaman, 28, agrees. From his high school class of 30 at
the St. Lasalle's Brothers School, he is one of only two students
who have not left for economic and educational opportunities in the
West.
</P>
<P>
   His family runs a small shop just off Manger Square.
</P>
<P>
   Giacaman says Bethlehem's economic situation is dire. It is
compounded by Israeli military checkpoints that sever connections
to East Jerusalem and Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a cage,'' he says. ``Those who can afford to, break
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Taljia's family can't afford to.
</P>
<P>
   She owns a small dry goods store with a portrait of the Holy
Family framed on the wall. She is bitter about the realities of
life for Christians under the new Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   During the violent clashes of the intifadah her family paid a
heavy price. In 1988, her husband, 57, suffered a blow from an
Israeli police baton, and died two weeks later. One of her sons
spent three years in an Israeli prison for throwing rocks. She
remembers that ``the mothers of the intifadah'' would visit their
sons in prison and would yell support outside the prison windows.
But by 1991 something began to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly it was about religion,'' she says. ``They shouted
that the boys. . . were Muslim soldiers fighting in the name of
Allah. I would ask them, `What about my sons, they are Christian?
Didn't they fight just as bravely?' ''
</P>
<P>
   As darkness descended in the Bethlehem neighborhood on a recent
evening, the sound from the local minarets blared. Annoyed, Taljia
turned and flicked the switch on a six-foot neon cross that she
erected atop her store one year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is to say that we are Christians, that we are proud, and
that we have been in Bethlehem for 2,000 years,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of Bethlehem, Christian emigration is stronger in the
rural villages of the West Bank and Galilee, where Christian life
has all but vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Take the West Bank town of Berkain. ``We have more funerals than
we do christenings,'' says Elias Sayegh, 65.
</P>
<P>
   There is no longer a priest assigned to either the Greek
Orthodox or Roman Catholic churches of Berkain. Occasionally,
visiting priests offer Masses on Saturdays. No Sunday service has
been held in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Sayegh holds the key to St. George's Roman Orthodox Church. It
is built into an ancient cave where tradition holds that Christ
healed a colony of 10 lepers. On a recent Sunday morning, Sayegh
walked through the narrow streets of the town, making his way to
pray alone in the church as he does most Sundays. He unlocked a
large steel door, which creaked as it opened. Inside, it was dark
and damp. Cobwebs hung from the altar.
</P>
<P>
   He lit a thin white candle and knelt to pray. A draft whistled
under the door. The candle flickered and for a moment the church
went dark. But the flame rekindled and cast a small, warm glow on
the ancient stone walls.

CHRISTIANS DWINDLING IN WAR-RAVAGED LEBANON

   DAMOUR, Lebanon _ There is not much left here.
</P>
<P>
   Once an elegant Christian town of hand-hewn stone homes and
citrus groves overlooking the Mediterranean, Damour is now a hollow
ruin. Weeds sprout from bombed-out foundations. Apartment buildings
stagger from mortar fire. One has imploded at an angle like a
broken accordian.
</P>
<P>
   Damour suffered more than most Christian towns in Lebanon's
bloody 15-year civil war that ended in 1990. It was just one of
many datelines of horror that transformed the country into a
television-age Armageddon. The conflict claimed 150,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
   Both Muslims and Christians fled Lebanon, but far more
Christians left. From a prewar Lebanese population of roughly 4
million, 500,000 of the 700,000 who emigrated were Christian. In
the eight years since, another 100,000 Christians have left.
</P>
<P>
   Damour's desolate streets were blanketed in fog on a recent
morning. The dull tapping of hammers broke a strange silence that
shrouds the town 15 miles south of Beirut. A work crew was fitting
new stones into the walls of St. Elia's Eastern Orthodox Church,
which was demolished in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Stonecutter Michael Abu Abdella, 58, wiped the plaster dust off
his hands and remembered the attacks that devastated the Christian
community and forced thousands to flee. The worst memory of that
time was the night in January 1976 when Palestinian Fatah
guerrillas returned to savage the 300 Christians who remained. They
dynamited homes and massacred entire families. They exhumed the
dead from the Christian cemetery and scattered skeletons throughout
the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christian families still don't feel safe coming back,'' said
Abdella.
</P>
<P>
   He now lives in Beirut but comes to Damour to help with the
church. He said most of his relatives and neighbors from Damour
have left the country over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure this town can ever come alive again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Once a confident majority fully in charge of a wealthy country,
the Christians of Lebanon have become an embittered minority
fearful of its future.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon's Maronites, by far the largest Christian denomination
here, have been affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church since the
12th century. The Maronites's close ties to Europe's Catholic
missionaries opened doors to Western education and ideas. Through
the centuries, this connection set them apart from Lebanon's Arab
Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   The Christians became doctors and lawyers and financiers. They
enjoyed complete political and economic dominance for decades after
their independence in 1943 from French colonial rule. This hegemony
fostered Maronite arrogance and elitism, which embittered the
Muslims. Even as the Muslim population grew, Christians refused to
share power.
</P>
<P>
   Then the war erupted in 1975. The Muslim-Christian cycle of
recrimination eventually spiraled into nihilistic carnage among
various militias. Christian militias also fought viciously among
themselves in the final throes of the war. Atrocities were
committed by all sides. Amid the violence, the Christians left in
droves.
</P>
<P>
   They fled to Latin America, the United States, and Europe. They
left in larger numbers than Muslims because they could afford to
and because of their ties to the West.
</P>
<P>
   Their exodus, and a concerted policy by a Muslim-dominated
government to naturalize hundreds of thousands of Muslim
immigrants, dramatically altered Lebanon's demographic landscape.
In the years before the civil war began, the creation of the state
of Israel had pushed some 300,000 Palestinians, the vast majority
of whom are Muslim, into squalid refugee camps inside Lebanon.
Through the decades, the Muslim birth rates also have been much
higher than those of Christians.
</P>
<P>
   These factors diminished the Christian presence in the country.
They also threaten the fragile balance that so tenuously holds
together Lebanon's denominations of Christians, Sunni and Shiite
Muslims, and Druze, a secretive sect that seceded from Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Christians worry that Lebanon's once-robust free market economy
will never be resurrected with the newly-emerged Muslim power base.
They fear that Beirut's legendary prewar character as a Paris of
the Middle East has been ruined by the intolerance of the
Iranian-backed, Islamist movement Hezbollah, or ``Party of God.''
</P>
<P>
   When Christians leave, they take their money with them _ $5
billion since the end of the war, by some estimates. Many Lebanese
leaders, Muslim and Christian alike, believe the country will have
to regain its largely Christian commercial base to rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   In a November interview, Mohammad Sammak, head of the
government's Christian-Muslim Committee for Dialogue and a senior
aide to outgoing Muslim Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, said,
``Christians are more financially versed and richer than Muslims.
They have more experience in banking and they have better
connections to and understanding of the free market. When they
leave and turn their back on Lebanon, they do great damage to this
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will need each other to survive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Just how many Christians remain in Lebanon is in dispute. There
are no official population figures in Lebanon. The last census was
taken in 1932. The reluctance to complete a new one illustrates how
explosive an issue population figures become when so many sects vie
for power. As Farid Khazen, a political science professor at the
American University of Beirut, puts it: ``Every group needs its own
lies.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Khazen estimates, and church officials privately
concur, that 1 million residents, or 25 percent of the country, are
Christian. This figure is less than half of the nearly 60 percent
majority of the early 1970s.

COPTIC CHRISTIANS BATTLE INTOLERANCE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AL KOSHEH, Egypt _ On a sweltering night last summer, the bodies
of two slain Christian men were dumped in the center of the
Christian neighborhood of this remote village on the banks of the
upper Nile River.
</P>
<P>
   What began as a local investigation into their murders has
exploded into a national case that has reopened old and deep wounds
for the Coptic Christian minority living in Egypt's Muslim society.
And it has become a dramatic example of the religious intolerance
that is pushing Egypt's Christians to steadily leave their
homeland.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks after the Aug. 14 murder, the victims' families and
local Christian leaders presented evidence that the killing was
done by a gang of five Muslims. But local police ignored their
claims and rounded up 1,000 Christians from the town for
questioning. Christians charge that police subjected dozens of
people, including women and small children, to beatings and torture
to force statements from them to frame a Christian for the crime.
He now faces the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian officials have reacted predictably, critics say, by
concerning themselves more with masking the perception of a
Muslim-Christian divide in Egypt than in investigating the case.
The government thus far has done nothing to reprimand the local
police, all of whom are Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they arrested a prominent Coptic bishop for speaking
out against the alleged injustices and a leading human rights
worker for doing the same. Both face charges of fomenting sectarian
strife. A five-count indictment against the bishop includes a
charge of threatening national security, which carries the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened in Al Kosheh is a very sad chapter for our
country,'' said Bishop Wissa, the frail, 60-year-old Coptic cleric,
on the October night he was arrested. ``We have traditionally got
along with our Muslim neighbors. But the situation is deteriorating
from bad to worse. We have spoken out and now I may face the death
penalty for doing so. How can I say nothing when this is happening
to our people?''
</P>
<P>
   Egypt's nearly six million Copts, by far the largest Christian
population in the Middle East, have for centuries coexisted with
Muslims. But it has never been easy. Today they are an embattled
minority, and they are leaving in significant numbers. Their reason
is primarily to pursue economic opportunity in the West amid
Egypt's crushing poverty, but the rising influence of Islamic
fundamentalism has forced an undercurrent of Christian-Muslim
tension to surface. And it has accelerated the emigration.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian flight has profound consequences for Egypt's
secular society. The Coptic minority has served as a firewall
against Islamic fundamentalism, a wall which journalists, artists,
and academics _ both Muslim and Christian _ fear has crumbled as
the Christian presence shrinks.
</P>
<P>
   The Coptic church estimates that more than 1 million Christians
have left for the United States, Europe, and Canada over the last
three decades. Every week at the American embassy in Cairo, dozens
of Coptic Christians wait in line with visa applications to Europe
and America. There are 250,000 Copts registered with the North
American Archdiocese of the Coptic Orthodox Church.
</P>
<P>
   As Egypt's Muslim population expands with one of the world's
highest birth rates, the Copts have become a smaller minority. In
1975, according to church statistics, the Copts represented close
to 20 percent of the total population. Today they are between 6 and
9 percent of Egypt's 60 million population.
</P>
<P>
   Discrimination against Copts is rarely as dramatic as the
incident at Al Kosheh. What they claim to face in their daily lives
is far more subtle.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Copts in recent years have heard their faith
denounced by fiery Islamic clerics on government-run television.
Copts from Egypt's professional classes are frightened of Islamists
who have imposed ``Sharia,'' or Koranic law, on Egypt's legal
system, undermining the country's self-image as a secular, and
tolerant, republic.
</P>
<P>
   Copts feel the discrimination in schools, especially in the
poorer neighborhoods of Cairo and small villages of upper Egypt,
where Islamist teachers sometimes distort and insult the Christian
faith. Only the Muslim faith, not Christianity, is taught in
mandatory religion classes in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   As their presence dwindles, Copts are being marginalized
politically and economically. Of the 26 governors appointed by
President Hosni Mubarak, none is a Copt. None of the presidents or
deans at Egypt's universities is a Copt. And with the powerful
professional syndicates increasingly under the control of the
fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood, Copts complain that they are
disenfranchised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who can afford to have left the country,'' says Moris
Sadik, a lawyer and director of a Coptic advocacy group called
Egyptian Human Rights for National Unity. ``For those of us who
stay, life is made very difficult. Opportunities are limited.
Discrimination is rampant.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Church's identity dates to 7th century
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The word ``Copt'' is derived from 7th-century Arab invaders who
used the term to refer to everyone in the country, the vast
majority of whom at the time were Christian. As Islam rapidly took
hold in Egypt over the following centuries, the Coptic Christians
held tightly to their identity.
</P>
<P>
   The Coptic church is one of the oldest in Christendom. It was
founded by St. Mark the Evangelist, who is said to have arrived in
Egypt in AD 60. The vast majority of Copts are of the Eastern
Orthodox rite, though there are smaller communities of Roman
Catholics and Anglicans in Egypt. The Copts of the Eastern Orthodox
Church adhere closely to ancient traditions. Most discreetly
profess their faith with a small blue tattoo of a cross on one
wrist. The clerics wear long beards, black vestments, skull caps,
and large leather crosses hanging from their necks.
</P>
<P>
   Copts are fiercely proud of their Egyptian identity and
generally reluctant to criticize the Egyptian government. This
makes the recent voices of protest all the more resonant.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they have suffered petty discrimination for centuries. One
lingering example is the 19th-century Ottoman empire restriction
against the construction and even repair of Christian churches
without approval from the highest levels of the government.
</P>
<P>
   Today, this law infuriates the church hierarchy that oversees
once-grand cathedrals and small parish churches that are crumbling.
Bishop Thomas, who oversees a diocese of 21 churches and
monasteries, says many of the properties have cracked foundations,
broken steeples, and lack plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what kind of danger to the state repairing a
toilet poses, but apparently there are security reasons for this,''
said Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   During the rise of pan-Arab nationalism in the 1950s and 1960s,
the economically prosperous Copts, who then represented 20 percent
of the population but held more than 50 percent of the nations's
wealth, saw their businesses and factories nationalized under the
socialist government of Gamal Abdel Nasser. Many of them left as a
result.
</P>
<P>
   Through the 1970s, sectarian tensions in Egypt simmered.
Sporadic violence occurred, amid bitter complaints by Copts of
discrimination. The violence intensified in 1980 as then-president
Anwar Sadat courted Islamic fundamentalists to consolidate power
against socialist rivals. This further embittered the Coptic
hierarchy, especially the church leader, Pope Shenouda III, who
charged that Sadat had replaced nationalism with religion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, Sadat outraged Copts by putting Shenouda under house
arrest, where he stayed for four years.

 &HT;    Publisher broadens panel to pick top nonfiction
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Get ready for another literary firestorm. Not
satisfied with stirring up a controversy over the 100 greatest
English language novels of the 20th century, the Modern Library
board is set to choose the 100 best nonfiction books of the 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
   The Modern Library editors did learn something, though, after
being criticized for having a panel of judges that included only
one woman _ A.S. Byatt _ with nine male writers who were all
eligible for membership in the American Association of Retired
Persons. This time, authors Caleb Carr, Ron Chernow, Stephen Jay
Gould, Charles Johnson, Jon Krakauer, Elaine Pagels and Carolyn See
have been added to the panel to make it younger and more diverse.
</P>
<P>
   Other judges are Modern Library editor Christopher Cerf, author
Gore Vidal, former Library of Congress librarian Daniel J.
Boorstin, author Shelby Foote, Carnegie Corp. director Vartan
Gregorian, historian Edmund Morris, art scholar John Richardson,
historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. and author William Styron.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best novels list did exactly what we hoped it would,''
says David Ebershoff, Modern Library publishing director. ``It
focused attention on books, reading and the Modern Library. For the
nonfiction list, the board will be more diverse, more involved, and
the ranking mechanism more subtle and responsive. That said,
however, I think the next list will be just as provocative _ if not
more so _ than the fiction list.''
</P>
<P>
   The final 100 selections will be announced April 29 at BookExpo
in Los Angeles. The American Booksellers Association will ask its
members for their own lists, and readers can register their choices
_ and complaints _ at http://www.randomhouse.com.
</P>
<P>
   In other news, Modern Library announced it will launch several
new series of nonfiction and expand into paperbacks. This spring it
will publish the Harlem Renaissance series and in the summer it
will release the Modern Library War series. Next fall, ``Into Thin
Air'' author Krakauer will edit Modern Library Exploration and film
director Martin Scorsese will edit the Modern Library Hollywood
series.
</P>
<P>
   _ THE REAL BUCKHEAD: There's more to Buckhead than Tom Wolfe's
descriptions in ``A Man in Full'' of lawns that ``rose up from the
street like big green breasts, and at the top of each breast was a
house big enough to be called a mansion.'' Long before the elegant
mansions and lush lawns, Buckhead was a rustic settlement known as
``Buck's Head.'' In her book ``Buckhead: A Place for All Time''
(Hill Street Press, $16.95), Susan Kessler Barnard draws on
archival material and interviews to trace the history of the area
from the original settlement in the 1830s through the Civil War,
Reconstruction and the explosive growth after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Barnard will sign copies of her book from 1 to 3 p.m. Saturday
at Barnes &AMP; Noble, 2900 Peachtree Road, 404-261-7747.
</P>
<P>
   _ DEEP THOUGHTS: Encouraged by the success of outdoor adventure
books such as ``Into Thin Air,'' HarperCollins has paid what
Publishers Weekly calls ``a high six figures'' for Bernie
Chowdhury's deep-sea diving saga. Scheduled for publication next
year, ``The Last Dive'' is the story of a father and son diving
team who push themselves to the limit and beyond. Chowdhury's
agent, Andrew Stuart, describes the tale as an underwater version
of ``The Perfect Storm.''
</P>
<P>
   _ NEW IN PAPERBACK: If you're one of the thousands of readers
trying to get a hardback copy of Alice McDermott's National Book
Award-winning novel, ``Charming Billy,'' now's your chance to pick
up the just-published Delta paperback edition for $12.95. The
hardback edition of McDermott's tale of an Irish-American family
has been out of stock in most book stores since weeks before
Christmas.

 NAZARETH: ... of Christians.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We have protected Christians. The fact is we have thousands of
applications of (West Bank) Christians who want to become citizens
of Israel,'' he says. ``That is because they don't want to live
under Arafat's government. They know what will be the future.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he believes that Christians within Israel and
parts of the West Bank still under Israeli control are afforded
equal rights, he said, ``I will not say there are no problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Christian leaders have complained loudly about the unequal
disbursement of government funding, in particular the Religious
Affairs Ministry's budget. Arab Israeli citizens, who make up
nearly 20 percent of Israel, pay the same taxes as other Israelis
yet receive only 1.5 percent of the funding, which goes to
religious schools, shrines, and institutional costs. With most of
the money going to the Arab Muslim majority, Arab Christians end up
with ``a pittance,'' says Ria.
</P>
<P>
   Mor declined comment on the disbursement. But one ministry
official conceded, ``Obviously, it is unfair, and has been unfair
for too long.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the rising influence of the ultra-Orthodox Jews in
Israeli politics has contributed to an atmosphere of intolerance.
Their growing strength affects secular Israelis as well as Reform
and Conservative Jews _ whose marriages and conversions are not
legally recognized under the current religious laws _ far more than
it affects Christians. But there are significant ways, church
leaders and Israeli analysts say, that the increased political
power of the ultra-Orthodox has heightened Israeli-Christian
tensions as well.
</P>
<P>
   The powerful religious party of Shas controls three key
ministries _ Religious Affairs, Labor, and the Interior. Netanyahu
is careful to articulate the importance of religious tolerance and
pluralism in Israeli society. But ultra-Orthodox elements within
his coalition are less concerned with those issues.
</P>
<P>
   One example is a proposed Knesset bill to make missionary
activity, and the possession of ``missionary'' literature, a
criminal offense. To many Christians, spreading the gospel is a
tenet of their faith. Many Christian leaders, especially
Jerusalem's American evangelicals, are offended by the proposal.
Although the law has languished for over a year, Netanyahu has
publicly indicated support.
</P>
<P>
   There are other ways that religious intolerance in Israel is
felt by Christians. The religious Shas party, for example, demanded
last year that the military suspend soldiers' visits to churches as
part of army-organized historical tours of Jerusalem because
ultra-Orthodox Jews consider it sacrilege to enter a church. And
this Christmas, the chief rabbinate in the Israeli city of Bat Yam
forbade a Jaffa function hall from allowing ``Christian events''
and threatened to revoke its license as a kosher establishment if
it failed to do so.
</P>
<P>
   These ultra-Orthodox initiatives, seen by Christians as hostile,
need to be viewed as the reaction of a religious fringe to
centuries of anti-Semitism, says David Hartman, an Orthodox rabbi
and founder of an institute that promotes dialogue between
religious and secular Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's stupidity, not intolerance,'' says Hartman. ``They don't
understand the significance of the minority, the love of a
stranger, which is a great commandment in our faith.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Christian faith, some American evangelicals are quick to
seize on any evidence of intolerance toward Christians and blow it
out of proportion, according to Shmuel Evyatar, the Jerusalem
mayor's liaison to the Christian community.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American Christian missionaries here want to think of this
place as a suburb, like some place in New Jersey,'' says Evyatar.
``The religious Jews are playing the game of democracy. They are
not harming it. They are not saying Christians should get out. But
they are saying don't come into my yard and tell me what to do.''
</P>

`Discrimination from two sides' in Nazareth
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the streets of Nazareth, which has by far the largest
Christian concentration in Israel, few Christians say they feel
under direct pressure to leave. Instead, they describe a sense that
they no longer belong, even in the same city where Jesus lived.
Sitting in a pew of the cavernous Orthodox Church of St. Gabriel,
Aissam, 56, a father of four, explains how many Christians feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We face discrimination from two sides,'' he says as the
footsteps of tourists echo in the church. ``We are treated as
second-class citizens by Israel, and the Muslim community does not
accept us.''
</P>
<P>
   How Aissam and Rose Farji ended up in Nazareth is a classic tale
of a Christian family caught between the rising Israeli nation and
the yearnings of Palestinians for their own independent state.
</P>
<P>
   Aissam is from the predominantly-Muslim West Bank village of Ber
Zeit, where he ran a grocery store. His family endured Israeli
occupation and arbitrary arrest and detention.
</P>
<P>
   When the frustrations of the occupation exploded into the
intifadah in 1987, small businessmen like Aissam suffered. Violent
clashes between Palestinian youths and Israeli troops made it
impossible for him to operate his store. The Israelis imposed
steadily higher taxes. He did nothing to support the intifadah.
Soon he was labeled a collaborator. Life grew worse.
</P>
<P>
   Many Palestinian Christians fought alongside their Muslim
compatriots in the intifadah, but the Christians were often
suspected of being aligned with the West and therefore sympathizers
with Israel. Aissam gave up in 1990 and closed the family store.
Most of his extended family left for the United States. But he
could not afford to and did not want to leave his homeland. He and
his wife moved to Nazareth hoping that life might be better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel caught up in all these forces. It's easy to feel
sometimes like you don't belong as a Christian,'' says Aissam.
</P>
<P>
   Modern Nazareth, a congested city of 60,000, is located in the
fertile north of Israel near the Sea of Galilee and falls within
the borders of the pre-1967 Israeli state. Fifty years ago,
Nazareth's population was 90 percent Christian. Today it is only 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
   With the largest population of Palestinians living within
Israel, Nazareth posed a challenge to the Jewish state: Would it
afford the population, Christian and Muslim, the same
infrastructure and opportunities as the rest of Israel?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, the Nazarenes say, is no. The Israelis instead
created a new Jewish community called ``Upper Nazareth,'' which has
traditionally received most of the government funding and support.
</P>
<P>
   Muslims and Christians have for years been united in their
criticism of this bias. But recently tensions have flared between
Nazareth's Christian minority and Muslim majority.
</P>
<P>
   In municipal elections last month, the Islamic Movement took
partial control of the city council for the first time. The
Christian mayor barely survived reelection. The Muslim community
resents an $80 million renovation of the city _ widening streets
and building 1,000 hotel rooms in preparation for the 4 million
tourists expected for the anniversary of 2,000 years of
Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   The recent tensions between Muslims and Christians revolve
around a vacant strip of land at the base of the Church of the
Annunciation. The mayor, Ramez Jeraisi, last year tore down a
school and a mosque within it that dated to the Ottoman era. This
infuriated Muslims who claim that the land holds a small shrine to
Shahab el Din, a Muslim military leader who fought against the
Christian crusaders in the 11th century.
</P>
<P>
   The municipality had planned to build a parking garage and plaza
there for tourists who come to visit Christian holy sites. But
Muslim activists occupied the land in the dead of night and have
erected a large green canvas tent where they hold daily prayer
services.
</P>
<P>
   A crudely constructed minaret with loudspeakers blares the
Muslim call to prayer. Green flags of the Islamic Movement flap in
the wind. The Muslim activists have created an architectural
rendering of an enormous mosque that they propose to build. The
battle is now in the Israeli courts.
</P>
<P>
   City politics is suddenly cast in religious terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor and his Christians do not fear God,'' says Mohammed
Nim'r Mahajneh, 57, who performs the call to prayer in the
makeshift mosque. ``They tried to destroy a Muslim shrine.''
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a gray galabia robe and clacking Muslim prayer beads,
he thundered against the land taking and compared it to a ``modern
Christian crusade.''
</P>
<P>
   Just up the street is a string of tourist shops. A 26-year-old
Muslim shop owner who gives his name only as Sari sells carved
wooden crucifixes and religious artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dispute has polarized things,'' he says, speaking in
perfect English but in very hushed tones, fearing that anyone who
speaks out on the issue can be targeted. ``Things have gotten very
tense.''
</P>
<P>
   Hassam, 29, a certified public accountant who is a Christian,
adds, ``There is not open hostility, but there is a feeling of the
society pulling apart.''

 &HT;    Among cool winter sights is Alaska's Northern Lights
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MCGRATH, Alaska _ Lying on my back on the middle of the frozen
Kuskokwim River outside of McGrath, I marveled at the spectacle in
the sky.
</P>
<P>
   While covering the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, I had walked
two miles down the ice-covered river to meet up with a musher
preparing to leave for Nome in the windless minus 20-degree
weather. To pass the time, I gazed at the star-filled sky hoping
for a glimpse of the famous northern lights.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't have to wait long. Ten minutes later, in a corner of
the southern sky, a shower of green light rained from top to
bottom. In the northern section, a pulsating yellow glob hovered
just above the tree line. Linking the two areas, a thick ribbon of
vivid reddish-yellow wavered, as if being held horizontally in a
stiff breeze. And in the middle of that ribbon, a huge dark hole
appeared to be sucking in the light.
</P>
<P>
   With such a display, it was easy to understand why the aurora
borealis has fascinated and often terrified humans for thousands of
years. The people of the Arctic who saw the aurora created many
legends and stories about it, while those who lived farther south
and rarely saw the aurora thought it was a supernatural omen of war
or destruction.
</P>
<P>
   As people began to seek more natural explanations for the
aurora, they came up with many theories: reflected firelight from
the edge of the world, sunlight reflected from the arctic ice, or
maybe reflected by ice crystals high in the sky. It wasn't until
the 20th century that people finally began to make headway in the
study of the aurora, and there are still many unanswered questions
about it.
</P>
<P>
   The aurora is caused by electrons that are blown from the sun.
The glow we see is caused by these electrons slamming into the
uppermost fringes of our atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The aurora is a permanent feature of the Earth's upper
atmosphere. It is actually an oval centered on the geomagnetic
poles. Southern auroras are called aurora australis; northern ones,
aurora borealis. In Alaska and the Yukon, the best time to view
them is during the winter, when there can be 20 hours or more of
darkness a day.
</P>
<P>
   The size and shape of the auroral oval changes depending on how
hard and how fast the solar wind is blowing. When the sun is quiet
and the solar wind is calm, the auroral oval is small and thin.
When the sun becomes more active and the solar wind hits the
earth's magnetic field with strong gusts, the auroral oval becomes
wider and stretches south.
</P>
<P>
   So, the aurora is always present, but for most people in Europe
and the lower 48 states in the United States, it rarely stretches
far enough south for them to see.
</P>
<P>
   Auroral light is similar to light from color television. In the
picture tube, a beam of electrons controlled by electric and
magnetic fields strikes the screen, making it glow in different
colors, according to the type of chemicals (phosphors) that coat
the screen. Auroral light appears as charged particles,
particularly electrons, rain down along the Earth's magnetic field
lines. The color of the aurora depends on the type of atom or
molecule struck by the charged particles.
</P>
<P>
   If you have never seen the aurora yourself, videos are available
that will give you some idea of what it is like, but you will have
to go to Alaska in winter to really appreciate the beauty of the
aurora.
</P>
<P>
   To learn more about the aurora, read The Aurora Watcher's
Handbook by T. Neil Davis (University of Alaska Press, 1992). Also,
Charles Deehr, the Geophysical Institute's aurora forecaster and a
professor emeritus, lists weekly predictions of aurora activity and
posts them on the Internet at: http://www.gi.alaska.edu
</P>
<P>
   Because the sun rotates every 28 days, Deehr and others are able
to predict the intensity of some auroral displays.

MODERN-DAY EXODUS LEAVES FEW CHRISTIANS IN HOLY LAND 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZARETH _ Aissam and Rose Farji walk in the footsteps of Jesus
Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Their home is perched on the same hill where 2,000 years ago
Jesus lived with his mother, Mary, and Joseph. Every morning, they
fight traffic on the narrow, crowded streets of the Holy Family's
hometown to reach the ancient well where Mary collected water.
</P>
<P>
   As caretakers of the Orthodox Church of the Archangel Gabriel on
the biblical site of ``Mary's well,'' they are busy these days
answering tourists' questions and cleaning up up after the tour
buses are gone. But their own parish is shrinking. Their own
indigenous Christian community is withering away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are disappearing,'' says Aissam, 56. ``It breaks our
hearts. We fear in our children's lifetime, the living Christian
community here will be gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The fear is not unfounded. The Christian community in the Holy
Land has witnessed an exodus that began in earnest about 100 years
ago and has steadily continued to the present. The Christian
presence in what is now modern Israel and the disputed West Bank
and Jerusalem has dropped from as much as 20 percent of the
population in the early part of this century to no more than 2
percent today. Even in Nazareth and Bethlehem, where for centuries
Christians were an overwhelming majority, they now comprise less
than one-third the population.
</P>
<P>
   The exodus of Christians poses grave political consequences. In
an age of rising Islamic and Jewish fundamentalism, the Christians
have provided a buffer against intolerance by demanding that the
rights of their religious minority be protected. As the Christian
presence shrinks, secular society _ for both Muslims and Jews _ is
left more vulnerable to religious extremism.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of Christian flight is more devastating in small
villages, many of which are among the world's oldest Christian
communities. In the West Bank hamlet of Berkain, where according to
biblical tradition Jesus healed a colony of lepers, there were 500
Christians in 1948. Today, there are fewer than 25.
</P>
<P>
   In the shadow of Mount Tabor in the village of Na'in, where
Jesus is believed to have raised a widow's son from the dead, there
are no more Christians. A Muslim family opens the church for
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, the Christian population has declined from 45,000
in 1940 to less than 10,000 today. Just steps from the Old City
path on which Jesus carried the cross, a bishop tells of a recent
sparsely attended funeral of an elderly parishioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were not enough young men left in the parish to carry
his casket,'' says Anglican Bishop Joseph Ria. ``For the few among
us who are still here, it was like witnessing the funeral not just
of this one man, but the life of a parish, the near disappearance
of the church in the land of Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   A confluence of events _ the war that forged a Jewish state in
1948 and the Arab-Israeli wars that followed in 1967 and 1973, the
Palestinian intifadah of the late 1980s, and now the newly created
Palestinian Authority _ have caught Christians in the hinge of
history.
</P>
<P>
   They are a minority within a minority, squeezed between the
Jewish state of Israel and the overwhelmingly Muslim Palestinian
Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Within the borders of Israel, Palestinian Christians live mostly
in Nazareth and the small villages of the Galilee. They complain
that they are viewed by Israelis as indistinguishable from
Palestinian Muslims and have suffered under Israeli rule.
</P>
<P>
   Within Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority, the Palestinian
Christians are concentrated in Bethlehem and scattered throughout
the West Bank. The Christians are Arabs, but they are still viewed
suspiciously as non-Muslims and treated as outcasts amid the
creeping Islamic influence of Palestinian society.
</P>
<P>
   Crushing political, economic, and social pressures have pushed
tens of thousands of Palestinian Christian families to emigrate to
the United States, Latin America, Australia, and Europe in the last
half century. Bernard Sabella, a Bethlehem University professor and
lead researcher for the Middle East Council of Churches, has found
that more Christian Palestinians live abroad than in the Holy Land.
Christians emigrate, he notes, at four times the rate of Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one more generation, we will barely exist. At the current
rate of decline, the Christian population will be a fraction of one
percent in the year 2020,'' says Sabella, who has pored through
Israeli and Palestinian Authority census data and diocesesan
records to document what he calls a ``historic exodus.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent Palestinian census, 2.8 million
Palestinians live in the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem _
territory captured by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 Six-Day War.
There are only 45,000 Christians there today, according to
Sabella's research, which means that Christians make up about 1.8
percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Within the pre-1967 borders of Israel, there are 6 million
people. Roughly 120,000 of them _ approximately 2 percent _ are
Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't stem the tide, we will have no living church in
the land of Christ. There will only be empty religious monuments
and museums,'' says the Rev. Peter Vasco, director of the Holy Land
Foundation and a liaison between the US Embassy and the Franciscan
order, which oversees Christian holy sites in Jerusalem. ``St.
Peter called the first churches `living stones.' But what we have
now are dying stones.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a cruel irony that the indigenous church is withering as
hundreds of thousands of Christians from Europe and North America _
from mainstream churches and fringe groups _ descend on the Holy
Land to mark the 2,000th anniversary of their faith.
</P>
<P>
   Primarily, historians say, the Christians of the Holy Land are
leaving a war-torn region to seek economic opportunity. The
Christians' traditional economic strength, higher levels of
education, and links to Western churches have helped them emigrate
to cities like Boston, Detroit, London, Toronto, and Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
   There have also been dramatic shifts in the demographic
landscape such as the influx to Israel of millions of Jewish
immigrants from Europe, Russia, and North Africa and a soaring
Muslim birth rate. These developments have made those Christians
who stay in their native villages and cities an ever-shrinking
minority. Statistics show that the remaining Christians tend to be
elderly, poor, and female.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest issue for Christians is the brain drain,'' says
Columbia professor and Palestinian Christian Edward Said. ``The
ones left behind are increasingly the powerless and the poor.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Government wrestles with an identity crisis
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a Jewish state, Israel still openly struggles to balance its
secular democracy with its religious foundation. There is no
constitution in Israel. A set of 1992 ``basic laws'' addresses
``human dignity and freedom'' for all citizens, but it does not
address the rights of religious minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians and Israeli Arabs who live within the borders
of pre-1967 Israel have citizenship and can vote. But in practice,
say Christian and Muslim citizens, they face separate and unequal
status in housing, education, and job opportunities. Thousands of
Israeli Palestinian families were displaced by the 1948 war. A
particularly poignant example has recently stirred debate in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   A half century ago, residents of two Christian villages in
Israel, Ikrit and Biram, were told by Israeli soldiers to leave
their homes and return in two weeks. But they have never been
allowed back. On Christmas, they still attend services in the old
stone church that sits atop a barren hill surrounded by the modern
kibbutz housing built over the old villages.
</P>
<P>
   The families have petitioned the Israeli High Court to be
allowed to return. The Israeli Minister of Justice recommended last
month that the families be given about 5 percent of the land. The
minister stressed that his ruling should not set a legal precedent.
There are an estimated 250,000 refugees from 60 other such villages
whom Palestinian land rights' groups contend fall under the same
category. The government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is
reportedly opposed to the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Uri Mor, the director of Christian community relations in the
Israeli Ministry of Religious Affairs, dismisses critics who charge
that Israeli policies, such as land appropriation, have contributed
to the flight of Christians.

 &HT;    Tracking the odd at the Iditarod
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS; sidebar NORTHERN-LIGHTS
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANCHORAGE, Alaska _ I knew the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race was
an expedition in extremes. I knew it was a race that attracts odd
personalities as it snakes across Alaska's rugged terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Then I saw the Poodle Man.
</P>
<P>
   Riding on the back of his sled, black cape flowing in the frigid
morning air, musher John Suter looked like a snowbound superhero
behind his team of 16 poodles.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a large yellow P on the chest of his black thermal
underwear, Suter waved to the crowds surrounding the starting line
of the 1991 race from Anchorage to Nome. I stood with my mouth
open, stunned. Others around me said they weren't surprised.
</P>
<P>
   Suter already was famous for racing a pack of fluffy Fifis
instead of hearty huskies, so the crowd expected this kind of
get-up. Most muttered about how harebrained it was to wear a skimpy
costume in minus-10-degree temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to the Iditarod, I learned to expect the surreal.
This year's race, which starts March 6, promises to be just as
wild, even though the Poodle Man will not be among the 63 entrants
vying for the $100,000 first prize. (Iditarod officials banned
poodles following the 1991 race, since their curly hair isn't
suited for extremely cold weather.)
</P>
<P>
   But it's not as if the onlookers look normal, either. Most were
bundled in the usual overcoats, gloves and ear warmers, but others
chose to use the ``last great race on Earth'' to showcase the big
ammunition from their closets: Full-length coats made with exotic
beaver and rabbit pelts; ski wear so puffy with insulation it would
make the Michelin man look anorexic; huge fur hats topped with
dangling fox heads, looking like the fluffy chapeau worn by the
grand poobah on The Flintstones.
</P>
<P>
   On television, the 1,159-mile Iditarod looks like a majestic,
brutal test run through some of the most scenic vistas in the
world. Mushers and dogs endure everything from razor-sharp ice
fields to waist-deep powder and knee-deep creeks. The race, which
takes about nine days to finish but can last as long as two weeks
for the slowest mushers, lives up to the billing.
</P>
<P>
   The race commemorates the 1925 run to Nome from Nenana (south of
Fairbanks) by mushers who used dog teams to bring serum that
defeated a diphtheria epidemic in the remote gold-rush town. Twenty
teams relayed the medicine 674 miles in five days.
</P>
<P>
   I knew the race's history and reputation, but it wasn't until I
attended in person (I covered the back of the pack for The
Anchorage Times newspaper, which is now defunct) and followed its
mushers from checkpoint to checkpoint along the rugged trail that I
understood the race's true personality.
</P>
<P>
   At its essence, it's the Indianapolis 500 of winter sports. It's
a race where fans and athletes can get as close as a handshake.
It's as full of pomp and ceremony as the Kentucky Derby. And it
frequently resembles Alaska's frozen answer to Mardi Gras.
</P>
<P>
   It starts on Fourth Avenue in Anchorage. Blocks away from the
starting line, you hear a symphony of more than 1,400 dogs filling
the frigid air with layers of barking, yapping and howling.
</P>
<P>
   Up close, the cacophony is deafening. The dogs, aware they are
about to be hitched to the dragline of a sled, go hysterical with
anticipation. This race is what they've been bred for, what they've
been trained for their entire lives. And the echoes of hundreds of
other canines yelping and whining only urges them further.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the mushers. Dozens of professionals and amateurs
fill the start chute. Veteran mushers, their glossy mobile kennels
adorned with the labels of sponsors, park next to the beat-up
vehicles of mushers who have scraped together enough money to feed
and water themselves and their dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Such past winners as Martin Buser, Rick Swenson and Susan
Butcher assemble their gear in high-tech sleds that look like
something out of ``The X-Files.'' The lesser-knowns do the same,
knowing they probably won't win without a little luck and some help
from the weather.
</P>
<P>
   As the teams lurch from the starting line every few minutes and
lunge through Anchorage's main avenues, the dogs pull two sleds,
not one. They're so excited, so anxious to be on the trail that
mushers need extra weight to slow the team down. The second sled is
often occupied by mushers' friends. Others raffle the chance to
ride through town and give the proceeds to charity.
</P>
<P>
   As with a marathon road race, onlookers line the trail, which
winds through the urban landscape toward the bedroom community of
Eagle River, about 20 miles north of Anchorage. When mushers pass,
they often wave and accept the muffled applause of their gloved
fans.
</P>
<P>
   But the start in Anchorage is mostly ceremonial. Once the teams
get to Eagle River, they're loaded into trucks. The next day, the
race begins again 30 miles north of Eagle River at the race's
official starting line in Wasilla.
</P>
<P>
   It's there that the race enters the full brunt of Alaska's most
intense wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   For the fans, it's where the fun starts. In the bush, onlookers
can approach mushers for a chat, pet the dogs when appropriate,
haul supplies to checkpoints, even help shovel snow along the
course. The Iditarod encourages volunteers, with a few restrictions
and rules, of course, to maintain the race's integrity. It's hard
to imagine the Daytona 500 allowing the fans to help change a tire
or wave the checkered flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ladies and gentleman ... and chickens . . .''
</P>
<P>
   The head flight attendant of the Alaska Airlines flight from
Anchorage to Nome is reciting the preflight safety information.
Instead of the monotone instructions about where the exits are and
how to buckle your seat belt, she's tailoring her monologue for a
flock of women dressed as poultry in coach class calling themselves
The Iditachicks.
</P>
<P>
   Waitresses from Darwin's Theory, a downtown Anchorage bar,
they've donned identical chicken costumes and T-shirts bearing the
pub's motto: ``A smart monkey never messes around with another
monkey's monkey.'' The plan is to fly to Nome so they can flap
their arms through the finish line ahead of the lead musher. And
every time the stewardess makes a chicken reference, they respond
in character with a lilting, alcohol-influenced chorus of barnyard
clucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the event of a loss of cabin pressure,'' the stewardess
says, ``oxygen masks will drop from the ceiling. Please place them
over your mouths ... and or beaks ... ``
</P>
<P>
   ``Bok! B-b-b-boooook bok bok!''
</P>
<P>
   ``The cushion of your seats can be used as a flotation device
... or a roost ... ``
</P>
<P>
   ``Bok! B-b-b-boooook bok bok!''
</P>
<P>
   The chickens are just a small example of how the entire state
goes dog crazy during Iditarod. Schools in bush towns shut down as
the race passes through. Newspapers print special editions of race
coverage. In the malls and restaurants, patrons pepper each other
with questions about who's in the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Iditarod name (originally attached to an abandoned
gold-mining town and river on the southern route of the race) has
become a joke among Alaskans. Since the race began blossoming in
popularity in the '80s, they've seen the addition of such events as
the Iditabike cycling race and the Iditaski cross-country
competition as well as goofy takeoffs like beer-drinking contests
and other barroom dares. Hence the Iditachicks.
</P>
<P>
   From the air, the homes and buildings of Nome look as if someone
has tossed a handful of crumbled cookies onto the middle of an ice
rink.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the white, frozen-over face of the Bering Sea
coastline blends with snow on the land. For hundreds of miles in
any direction, Nome and its 4,000 residents are the largest outpost
on Alaska's western coast. Smaller towns and villages are reachable
by truck or snow machine in the winter, but Nome is basically
isolated.
</P>
<P>
   As the terminus of the race, Nome is a gracious, if ill-prepared
host. The thousands who fly into town for the race outnumber hotel
rooms 10-1. So fans often stay with residents willing to rent out a
room, a couch or space for a sleeping bag. Hospitality like that is
what makes for lasting Iditarod memories.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, the race is the thing. Long before the mushers
have left the closest checkpoint 20 miles away in Safety, a layer
of snow, as in Anchorage, is dumped along Front Street.
</P>
<P>
   When the first dog team is glimpsed on the outskirts of town, a
booming fire alarm lets everyone know the race is about to end.
Doesn't matter what time of day or night it is. The town stops what
it's doing and rushes to surround the burled wooden-arch finish
line.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, the first musher was Rick Swenson, who had already won
the race four times but had been matched by Susan Butcher, who
chalked up four relatively quick wins as the second woman ever to
win the race. Swenson braved a horrendous blizzard along the Norton
Sound to pull ahead of a pack of other mushers.
</P>
<P>
   The time: around midnight. The temperature: minus-50 with gusts
that dropped the wind chill to minus-75. But with the
adrenaline-filled anticipation among the crowd, which packed itself
shoulder-to-shoulder, 10 people deep along the finish chute, the
weather was barely noticeable.
</P>
<P>
   That is, until it got so cold, my pencil wouldn't write.
Everyone nearby was breathing heavily. Breath is full of moisture.
Moisture freezes. And with hundreds in close proximity, a fog of
exhalation enveloped the crowd. In minutes, my notebook paper and
pencil were covered with so much frost, they were useless. I envied
the smart folks who thought ahead enough to climb onto the snowy
rooftops of downtown businesses for a better, if colder, view.
</P>
<P>
   Swenson charged down the street's snowy path, waving to
onlookers and delivering high-fives to kids who converged on his
passing sled. A roar, muffled by ski masks and scarves and parka
hoods, went up from the crowd. Cameras flashed. The dogs barked.
And another race ended as Swenson stopped his sled, walked to the
front of the pack and led his dogs over the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   A race announcer converged for an interview with the
out-of-breath musher.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the greatest race in the world,'' Swenson said between
exhausted gasps.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't have agreed with him more.

<P>
   IF YOU GO . . . BY AIR IS BEST WAY TO GET TO SNOWY IDITAROD
</P>
<P>
   Getting to the Iditarod's starting line in Anchorage is easiest
by air, since more than 230 flights arrive daily at Anchorage
International Airport. (The drive from the Palm Beaches and
Treasure Coast is roughly 5,300 miles, for trivia's sake).
</P>
<P>
   Depending on what airport you connect through, flight times to
Anchorage are: Seattle: 3 hours; Salt Lake City: 5 hours; Los
Angeles: 5 hours; and Chicago: 5 hours, 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Once at Anchorage International, ground transportation includes
taxis, buses, rental cars and some hotel shuttles. Downtown is just
15 minutes away.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous hotel accommodations are available _ most major chains
operate hotels there _ as well as dozens of bed-and-breakfast inns.
</P>
<P>
   FORGET DRIVING TO NOME
</P>
<P>
   It is not possible to drive to Nome from either Anchorage or
Fairbanks. The city also is not served by state ferry system or
Alaska Railroad. Once you arrive by plane, however, there are
almost 300 miles of roads to explore by rental vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines and Yute Air provide year-round, daily service
between Nome and Anchorage. They have a direct flight time of 75
minutes, or three hours if the flight stops in Kotzebue, a
neighboring Eskimo community. (Alaska Airlines: (800) 426-0333;
Yute Air: (888) 359-9883.)
</P>
<P>
   Accommodations, restaurants, gift shops, grocery stores, bars,
post office and bank are all within a 2.5-square-mile radius. Warm
walking shoes are highly recommended. The Nome airport is about 2
miles from downtown Nome. Taxi fare is $5 per person. Rental cars
will be left at the airport if you request this service in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Nome has a number of accommodations, including hotels,
apartments and a variety of bed-and-breakfast lodgings. When
Iditarod rolls around in March, however, it is sometimes hard to
find a place to stay.
</P>
<P>
   But after all commercial accommodations are booked, the Nome
Visitor Center will refer visitors to private homes. The available
space could be an extra bedroom, sofa or sleeping bag space. The
rates vary accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   GETTING TO THE VAST INTERIOR
</P>
<P>
   If you want to visit the towns and villages along the Iditarod
Trail, have your travel agent make your flight and lodging
reservations, since companies and facilities can change yearly.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies cater to those who want to visit the smaller
villages and towns. Some offer travel packages for touring the
entire Iditarod Trail.
</P>
<P>
   THINGS TO DO - BESIDES FREEZE
</P>
<P>
   The Iditarod is the granddaddy of Alaska's winter events, but
there are numerous other major events to enjoy from November to
March. They include:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Great Alaska Shootout - Each year on the weekend after
Thanksgiving, the University of Alaska Anchorage hosts one of the
premier holiday college basketball tournaments in the nation at the
Sullivan Arena in Anchorage. Recent years have seen the
participation of NCAA powerhouse programs such as Duke and Indiana.
In 1999, the tournament will include Kansas, Louisville and
Michigan. For tickets and information, call (907) 786-1230.
</P>
<P>
   _ New Year's Eve Fireworks and Torchlight Parade - An hour's
drive south of Anchorage on the Seward Highway, the Alyeska Ski
Resort in Girdwood hosts this annual event. Best of all, you don't
have to be a skier to enjoy the spectacle of dozens of skiers
weaving downhill with glowing torches. (907) 754-2219.
</P>
<P>
   _ Polar Bear Jump Off Festival - Held in mid-January at the
Small Boat Harbor in downtown Seward (two hours south of
Anchorage), this annual winter festival features the antics of
``polar bears'' (otherwise known as crazy Alaskans who enjoy
jumping from a dock into icy water in the middle of winter while
thousands of spectators look on). Bus and train trips are available
from Anchorage. (907) 224-5230.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fur Rendezvous - Held during two weeks in Anchorage (this year
from Feb. 12-21) the biggest winter festival in the state
celebrates the town's one-time status as the center of fur trading
in Alaska. With carnivals, sled dog and snow machine races, ice
carving, Alaska Native crafts and, yes, a fur auction, it's a great
way to sample all of Anchorage's winter activities. (907) 277-8615.
</P>
<P>
   _ Annual International Ice Carving Competition - Carvers from
around the world come to Anchorage's Fifth Avenue Town Square in
March to shape detailed sculptures from massive blocks of ice
during this annual outdoor event. (907) 279-5650.

FROM PONZI SCHEME TO SHELL GAME 
</HEADLINE>
  By MICHAEL KINSLEY 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Tuesday's State of the Union address, President Clinton's
proposed Social Security reforms included investing some of the
federal budget surplus in the stock market. In December 1996, Slate
Editor Michael Kinsley provided a prejudiced primer on Social
Security privatization:
</P>
<P>
   Privatization means allowing individuals to invest for
themselves all or part of what they and their employers put into
Social Security. Whatever the merits of this idea--and there are
some--it does not address the problem at hand. Social Security is a
Ponzi scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Current payers-in are financing current payers-out, not their
own retirements. Privatization assumes an end to the Ponzi scheme:
Every generation saves for its own retirement. But you can't get
there from here without someone paying twice--for the previous
generation and the current one--or someone getting less (or
someone--i.e., the government--borrowing a lot of money).
</P>
<P>
   If Social Security manages to achieve a higher return, by
investing some or all of its assets privately, the rest of the
economy will achieve a lower return, by having more of its assets
in government bonds. In essence, the gain to Social Security will
be like a tax on private investors--an odd thing for conservative
think tanks to be so enthusiastic about.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the arrival of this huge pot of money looking for a home
will depress returns in the private economy, while the need to
attract an equally huge pot of money into the Treasury to replace
the lost revenue will increase the returns on government bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Result? The diversion will be at least partly self-defeating.
</P>
<P>
   The size and security of future retirement benefits ultimately
depend on the country's general prosperity at that time in the
future. Checks to be cashed in the year 2055 (whoops! there's a
number) will be issued in 2055, whatever promises we make or don't
make today.
</P>
<P>
   The most direct way for Social Security to affect future
prosperity is to increase national savings, of which the Social
Security reserve is part, by trimming benefits and/or increasing
revenues. Since we have to do that anyway--even as a prelude to
privatization--why don't we do it first? Then we can argue about
privatization at our leisure.

MONEYBOX: WHY DOES AT HOME NEED EXCITE-MENT? 
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES SUROWIECKI 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)
<TEXT>
<P>
   Quick. Why would At Home, the provider of online access which
effectively has exclusive rights to deliver broadband Internet
access to almost 60 million cable-television subscribers, spend
$7.5 billion to acquire Excite, an online portal that's at best
fourth in the race for Internet eyeballs?
</P>
<P>
   Hey, baby, content is still king.
</P>
<P>
   That, at least, is the apparent reason for what at this point
seems like a rather curious purchase by At Home. And while it's
certainly a comforting reason for anyone who makes his living as a
content provider--that is, me--I think I'll need some more evidence
before it becomes a convincing reason.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why. At Home is currently a very small company in terms
of the actual business it's doing (though not in terms of its
market cap, which is currently close to $12 billion). There are
only 330,000 At Home subscribers, and the firm did just $47 million
in revenue last year. Needless to say, it has yet to actually make
any money. For all of that, though, it's hard to find a company
associated with the Net whose future looks brighter. At Home's
service will provide access to the Net at speeds up to 100 times
faster than current modems, and will do so over already-existing
cable lines for a cost of $40 a month. As far as I'm concerned,
serious market penetration by At Home will transform not just our
experience of surfing the Net but the economics of the Internet as
well. Speed, in that sense, is the Net's killer app.
</P>
<P>
   And speed would be that killer app regardless of who was
creating At Home's gateway to the Net. Although careful
explanations of why At Home wanted to spend all this money have
been a little difficult to come by, people have pointed to Excite's
personalization features--which any portal worth its salt
</P>
<P>
   has. They've mentioned that these features will allow At Home to
do a better job of tracking customers, marketing to customers, and
serving its advertisers. They've also mentioned, of course,
Excite's established user base. The number being bandied about is
20 million, but all that number represents is people who at one
time or another have registered with Excite. And speaking only for
myself, I couldn't tell you how many Web sites there are that I've
registered at and never visited again.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, even if we say that Excite has 20 million
customers, is it really plausible that they would turn down the
chance to use At Home's service if At Home were allied with some
other portal site, or if At Home created its own portal (which I
guarantee you would cost less than $7.5 billion)? Unless I'm
missing something, At Home customers are still going to be able to
head to Yahoo or Go.com if they want, so wouldn't the Excite
fanatics have been able to subscribe to At Home and still use their
site?
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, of course, the deal makes dazzling sense for
Excite. At Home is buying the portal for something like a 67
percent premium (depending on what happens to At Home stock in the
meantime). And although some people have suggested that At Home is
doing the deal because its own stock price may be inflated, its
shares are certainly no more inflated than Excite's. And any Excite
shareholder who sold Tuesday got as much as $110 a share. In cash.
In that sense, Excite's executives have done a really stunning job
of maximizing shareholder value.
</P>
<P>
   As for At Home, well, I'd say that betting against CEO Tom
Jermoluk is a mistake. And some consolidation in this industry was
inevitable. But we all know by now that most mergers don't work,
and I'm assuming that's as true in the world of the Net as in the
real world. In the end, At Home may have underestimated just how
potent its technology is all by itself, and how little it needs
add-ons to attract customers. TheStreet.com quoted one portfolio
manager Tuesday saying, ``A great pipe is not worth very much
unless you give people a reason to use it.'' Um, hello? Getting the
whole Internet 100 times faster than you normally do isn't a great
reason to use At Home, but having Excite as your gateway is? Let's
simply say: not.

BROWSER: WHO SAYS WWII VETS ARE THE GREATEST? 
</HEADLINE>
  By JACOB WEISBERG 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The No. 1 best seller in America this week is ``The Greatest
Generation,'' by NBC news anchor Tom Brokaw. The most acclaimed and
second highest grossing film of 1998 (just behind Armageddon) was
``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Steven Spielberg's film is fiction and Brokaw's book is
something akin to oral history, they have in common a fashionable
theme: the nobility of those who served in the armed forces during
World War II and, by extension, Americans of that age in general.
</P>
<P>
   You might describe this perspective as GI envy. Both Brokaw
(born in 1940) and Spielberg (born in 1946) evince a powerful sense
of nostalgia for the world of their fathers. As his title suggests,
Brokaw makes an explicit case for the superiority of the World War
II generation. In an introduction to the interview-profiles that
make up his book, he repeats a claim he first made on television
when he was swept up by the emotion of the 50th anniversary of
D-Day in 1994: ``This is the greatest generation any society has
produced.''
</P>
<P>
   Were they?
</P>
<P>
   Their children's generational neuroses don't necessarily prove
Brokaw wrong. But the Brokaw position is badly flawed, not because
of the instinct that motivates it but because of a romanticizing
tendency that eclipses all logic and evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that the GIs were somehow better people than those
born after them remains, like most facile generalizations about
generations, a matter of prejudice, not analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Let's look at a few of Brokaw's overreaching assertions. In his
introduction, he writes of the GIs, ``They stayed true to their
values of personal responsibility, duty, honor, and faith.'' That
sounds plausible--where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio? But consider
just one of those attributes: ``faith.'' Putting aside the question
of whether more faith is a good thing, was the GI generation really
more religious than others? Brokaw doesn't offer any support for
this claim, and one might well make the opposite case. The United
States has probably become more religious as boomers have become
the dominant demographic group. About 10 percent more people now
say they belong to churches than did so in the 1950s, when the GIs
predominated.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the traits Brokaw attributes to the GIs are subject
to similar demurrals. ``That's another legacy of the World War II
generation, the strong commitment to family values and community,''
Brokaw writes in another characteristic passage. It's true that
returning veterans didn't get divorced in large numbers. But that
doesn't prove that our grandparents and parents had a deeper
commitment to family values. It simply testifies to the legal and
social reality they inherited--it was hard to get divorced in the
1940s and '50s.
</P>
<P>
   Who changed that reality? The GIs did, because they found the
virtual prohibition on divorce an intolerable restriction on their
freedom. As divorces became more readily available, GIs had them
too. The baby boomers who inherited the divorce laws the World War
II generation loosened have in recent years begun to contemplate
tightening them again.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean to imply that Brokaw's book is all drivel. It
includes a number of moving stories about wartime heroism that can
be appreciated without reference to its argument, which is pretty
much superfluous. But what's missing from Brokaw's book--as from
most oral history--is any hint of analytical rigor.
</P>
<P>
   Aspects of American life that Brokaw deplores, such as
segregation and McCarthyism, are viewed as part of the wallpaper.
It was not the GI generation that rounded up Japanese Americans and
put them into camps. That was merely ``American racism.''
</P>
<P>
   But when it came to the good that happened on their watch,
Brokaw gives the GIs themselves full credit. ``They came to
understand the need for federal civil rights legislation,'' he
writes. ``They gave America Medicare.'' Well, GI Johnson did give
America Medicare. But others, such as GI Dole, voted against it.
</P>
<P>
   Let's not forget that George Wallace and Joe McCarthy also
served in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Brokaw repeats most of the other familiar cliches: World War II
veterans know the value of a dollar, they never boast, and they're
reluctant to talk about their wartime experiences.
</P>
<P>
   I'm tempted to say that Brokaw never met my Uncle Stanley. Of
course, it's true that there are a lot of World War II-era vets who
aren't inclined to relive the battlefield horrors they experienced.
But this may have less to do with the unique stoicism of a
generation than with the natural inclination everyone has to
repress traumatic experiences.
</P>
<P>
   If Vietnam vets have been tempted to make more of a meal of
their experiences, it's partly due to the fact that those
experiences weren't widely shared. The therapeutic culture of the
present era also probably plays a role, teaching us that it's not
healthy to keep one's pain bottled up inside. But who created that
therapeutic culture? You could argue, once again, that it was a
bequest from members of the GI generation, who introduced
psychiatry and psychoanalysis into American life.
</P>
<P>
   That many of the GIs Brokaw interviews say explicitly is that
the baby boomers lack the moral character they themselves had.
``They faced great odds and a late start, but they did not
protest,'' Brokaw writes of the GIs, casting another aspersion at
the Vietnam generation.
</P>
<P>
   But at the risk of stating the obvious, Vietnam was not like
World War II. The question men of draft age faced after Pearl
Harbor was whether they would serve their country in an
unambiguously good cause. The challenge faced by the Vietnam
generation was morally more complex: How do you serve your country
when it is engaged in a morally dubious cause (a cause the country
as a whole--not just a few protesters--came to conclude was a
mistake)?
</P>
<P>
   The World War II generation also had little choice. Everyone was
needed in the war effort, and there were few opportunities to dodge
the draft. During the Vietnam War, the military needed only a small
percentage of those who were eligible, and there were many options
for evasion, legal and illegal. Some served and didn't protest.
Others protested and didn't serve. Some, like Bob Kerrey and John
Kerry, served and then protested.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, there is no obvious answer to who answered this
quandary in the best way. The GI envy felt by members of the
Vietnam generation seems in part a longing for the clearer moral
imperative of another time.
</P>
<P>
   There are, to be sure, pivotal generational experiences. No one
would deny that the Great Depression and World War II molded one
group of people or that Vietnam shaped another. But attempts to
explain history in terms of common traits already possessed by the
peer groups that confronted these events are seldom illuminating.
Just as we cannot know how the baby boomers would have responded to
the moral challenge of World War II, we cannot know how the World
War II generation would have responded to the different moral
challenge of Vietnam. For that matter, we can't compare the GIs to
the Athenians of Pericles' time, the Florentines of Michelangelo's,
or the Americans of Abraham Lincoln's.

CLOTHES SENSE: THE WAY WE WORE 
</HEADLINE>
  By ANNE HOLLANDER 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the movies, the past is indeed a foreign country; they dress
differently there. The clothes on women, particularly, create
foreignness in different ways. Depending on what era the movie is
set in, clothes can conjure a unfamiliarity that is soothingly
adorable or uneasily alien.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years back, and the gaze is nostalgic. But go 45 years
back, and the fashions cross into a mist that renders them faintly
dangerous--they are feared because their truth has finally been let
go. Instead of indulgence, 40-year-old fashion seems to need
taming. How else to explain the way movies use ridicule and easy
cliches when re-creating the clothes of the 1950s?
</P>
<P>
   You can see how it works in the recent movie ``Pleasantville,''
in which a pair of modern teens are transported back 45 years--not
into real life, but into a black-and-white Ozzie and Harriet-style
TV sitcom. The movie's conceit is that sitcom conventions of that
time--no color, no sex, no bathrooms--delimit the characters'
reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pleasantville'' suggests that '50s fashions for women have now
come to mean what female Victorian clothing used to mean in the
1920s--not just clothes in a different style, but a metaphor, a
compendium of ridiculous and unnatural devices invented to dishonor
female life and liberty. The actual clothes of the '50s are now
almost half a century gone, most of them vanished. We only see them
in old films, old television and old magazines, just the way 1880s
fashions were understood, 40 years later in the 1920s, from ancient
fashion plates and daguerreotypes.
</P>
<P>
   The transition from the 1880s to the 1920s was severe. By the
second half of the 1920s, female fashion and female life had been
totally transformed. Women had adopted short hair and short skirts;
they wore the easy-fitting sweaters and dresses appropriate for
modern female citizens, who by that time had acquired effective
means of contraception, gainful employment and the vote. Too young
to remember the ordinary clothes of the previous era, they regarded
huge bustles, sweeping trains, lofty coiffures, and tightly laced
waists with a ferocious derision born of dread.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at the end of the 1990s, with the evidence drawn mainly
from old movies and old sitcoms, '50s fashion is similarly ripe for
reductive contempt. Those big, pointy breasts; useless hats; and
lampshade skirts look so creepy on the screen--and hardly a woman
now alive can remember what the great range of real clothing was
like at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this phenomenon mysteriously rights itself the further we
recede in time. Go back 50 more years, and all our social
perceptions become romantically transformed. Clothes in historical
movies can show the really distant past as a friendly foreign land,
perhaps even a lot like the here and now. All Ancient Historical
Drag is morally and visually neutral, apt for inventive play with
the styles of a century back, or five centuries, or 20.
</P>
<P>
   Victorian fashion, for example, wholly redeemed, is often
treated with great respect in movies such as ``The Portrait of a
Lady.'' The high hair and big bustles have been assimilated to all
the other harmless customs of antiquity; they've become the
equivalent of Egyptian breastplates and Elizabethan padding.
</P>
<P>
   Historical films are usually kind to the olden days, updating
the principal women's clothes so the actresses look attractive by
modern standards. Two recent releases deal with the Elizabethan
age--''Elizabeth,'' the bloody tale of the Virgin Queen's rise, and
``Shakespeare in Love,'' a romp through Elizabethan theater.
</P>
<P>
   The first shows late 16th century fashion looking ridiculous
only on the aging queen herself, as if no other woman at the time
ever wore a rigid farthingale and stuffed sleeves, a tightly
frizzed wig and a bushel of pearls, or painted her face with white
paste. The young court ladies in Elizabeth appear in their natural
hair and skin, wearing modern-looking Renaissancey garments that
run to becomingly mobile and flowing silk dresses with smoothly
boned bodices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare in Love'' has authentic Elizabethan dress for
everybody, but there's a good deal of extra emphasis on the way the
period corsets flatten the breasts and strictly encase the
ribs--and on how thrilling it is when the corsets come off.
</P>
<P>
   In '50s movies set in Elizabethan times, of course, everybody
wore big, molded, and pointy breasts with their Renaissancey
garb--no flattening was permitted and certainly no exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Even though corseted bodies are authentically Elizabethan, they
are used so freely in both these films because they're modish once
more. Modern designers such as Christian Lacroix and John
Galliano--and especially Jean-Paul Gaultier--overthrew '60s
ideology to reinstate the corset, using them as sexy accents in the
early '90s. Such recent use has decisively transformed the standard
20th century emblem of female oppression back into the erotic
device it always was. Corseting has stopped looking dishonorable
and started looking chic again, both as a feature of recent ball
gowns and wedding gowns and as a costume component that can give a
modern frisson to movies set in ancient days.
</P>
<P>
   The '50s aren't quite ancient yet, but they're getting more so.
By contrast to the condescension of ``Pleasantville'', genuine
tenderness for the time could be seen in ``The Last Picture Show,''
a 1971 film about real life in 1951. Nostalgia could still be
evoked after only 20 years, and many remembered when. The movie was
beautifully restrained and accurate with respect to clothing--the
peasant blouses, the swinging skirts, the smooth, side-parted hair,
the garter belts and capacious underpants from a time before
Spandex were all deliciously heartbreaking, never exaggerated for
laughs.
</P>
<P>
   The film's evocation of the style of the time was marred only by
insufficient attention to movement. The young jeans-wearing
actresses of the '70s failed to walk in the correct '50s style
while wearing long narrow skirts. (The secret: Knees together, and
don't try to stride.)
</P>
<P>
   Today, in the '90s, right on schedule, fashions of the '70s are
being given a nostalgic, sympathetically accurate whirl in such
movies as ``Hilary and Jackie'' and ``The Ice Storm.'' A genial
gaze is being cast on them just as flared trousers, square-toed
shoes, and long male hair are once again looking normal in the
real-life fashion universe.
</P>
<P>
   In another 20 years, no doubt, '70s fashion will be in for its
share of cinematic contempt (once the square toes are truly gone)
just as the '50s finally achieve true antiquity.
</P>
<P>
   The modes of any period can easily be made to look stupid. Even
in its own day, fashion needs a lot of enhancement to make it look
great. Whereas fashion photography--in the '50s as always--aimed to
arouse active lust for new goods, the clothes in '50s movies were
so thoroughly surreal as to look quite unfit for normal wear, even
if they were waitresses' uniforms or girl-next-door dresses. Movie
garb was automatically read as part of the tradition that stretched
back to silent Hollywood days, with everything made specially for
the stars and uniquely worn by them.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,'' the designers fit Elizabeth Taylor
into a form-fitting, made-to-measure, boned-and-stayed,
built-in-bra sort of slip, unobtainable by anybody else, an
inspired collaboration between Taylor's unbelievable body and the
costume department. Real '50s slips had no relation to it at all.
They were like the ones in ``The Last Picture Show,'' with wrinkles
around the middle and unreliable straps that slid around on the
shoulders, uneasily contending with the bra straps.
</P>
<P>
   In the '50s, nobody wanted the movies to show all that except
for the Italian ones, where the sexiest women all wore ill-fitting
slips and had hairy armpits, too. That was really foreign.

   MCNEELY-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Sen. Jane
Nelson is persistent. The Republican from Flower Mound has
championed term limits and initiative and referendum for years. And
even though her Republican Party of Texas now opposes rather than
supports I&AMP;R, as it is called, and is neutral on term limits,
Nelson is still pursuing what most Texas legislative observers
think is an impossible dream. (McNeely, Austin American-Statesman)

   YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ There's much to be said for
neighborhood schools as an alternative to busing, particularly in
the potential for walk-in parental involvement and the
re-establishing of communal identities. All things equal, it's
right to let children attend the school nearest them. But with the
shift to neighborhood schools and changes in attendance policies,
districts risk putting all of their eggs in that basket and
forfeiting something many urban districts have been doing right:
giving parents choice within the district. (Young, Waco

   COXNET BOOKS _ To get a sense of just how drastically the

novel _ has changed over the last few decades, compare Allen
Drury's ``Advise and Consent,'' published exactly 40 years ago, and
the hot political novel of the moment, Erik Tarloff's
``Face-Time.'' Given today's political reality, it's no surprise
that Drury's brand of fiction should have given way to a
considerably cruder, more satiric type of fiction. (Kakuntani, N.Y.

   BRASHEET, Lebanon _ Someday, they could meet on the rocky battle
ground of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah guerrilla Ahmed Sayeed is from south Lebanon, where he
leaves his job and children at night to answer a call to battle
inspired by Muslim clerics. He literally prays to die in martyrdom
in battle against Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli paratrooper Itamar Haviv is from Jerusalem, but follows
the path of his father, who also fought in Israel's long Lebanon
war. He's fights for patriotism and seeking personal challenge.
But, when he's through, he wants to be a tour guide.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews in different cities recently with the Cox News
Service, two Hezbollah fighters and two Israeli paratroopers
described their views of the 17-year-old conflict that grips this
tiny country on the eastern Mediterranean Sea.

   They are emblematic of a war that pits east against west, and
religious men seeking martyrdom against youths just beginning their
adult lives.
</P>
<P>
   About the only reality they hold in common is the strain that
comes from the days-long ambushes they set for each other -- a
guerrilla tactic Israel actually learned from Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   While Hezbollah, the ``Party of God,'' is trying to repel an
invader from their land, the Israelis acknowledge they are holding
a place until a political deal is made over issues elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a restless public, Israeli leaders say they want to leave
Lebanon. But, they need assurances from the Lebanese and Syrian
governments that Hezbollah will not then venture into Israel to
launch attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Syria, which controls Lebanon and has partial control over
Hezbollah, stands in the way of such a peace deal until Israel
returns to Syria the Golan Heights nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Since Israel's Lebanon invasion in 1982, 894 Israeli soldiers
and 1,400 Hezbollah guerrillas have been killed, according to the
two sides. And, over the years, Hezbollah has become a formidable
army.
</P>
<P>
   Sayeed, 30, builds houses by day here in Brasheet, which sits
just outside the nine-mile-wide band of territory occupied by
Israel in southern Lebanon. Israeli shells often fall nearby, and
occasionally in, the small farming town. Many civilians and
fighters have died.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on a porch in the small village, Sayeed looks like any
contractor in his flannel plaid shirt, neatly trimmed reddish beard
and cotton pants. He could be an American yuppie, but he has been
fighting for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Many nights, he leaves his wife and two children to await in
ambush for Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are born here. We are religious and we love our land,'' he
says. ``We are all asking to be martyrs.''
</P>
<P>
   His friend, Khalil Musa, is a slightly-paunchy electrician by
day who at night sometimes sets the remote-controlled road-side
bombs used by Hezbollah. During his 12 years of fighting, he has
been in ambushes that may have killed four Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he ever feels sorry for killing Israelis, he answers
unequivocally, ``Never.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim begins here.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Our belief is that the Jews are our enemies,'' he says. ``The
behavior of the Israelis makes us carry our guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel's army might be world-famous, Musa says, but he calls the
Israeli soldiers ``cartoons.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends here.)
</P>
<P>
   Far away, in an Israeli base where combat troops periodically
return for training, the two paratroopers describe their view of
the war.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that almost all Israelis must serve in the army, platoon
leader Haviv and squad leader Moti Rubin, both 20 years old,
decided to go for the action and volunteer as paratroopers.
Applicants must pass a two-day fitness test.
</P>
<P>
   Haviv, tall with a close-cropped military haircut, emphasized a
``patriotic'' and practical call to fight, saying Israel must fight
hostile neighbors to survive. He feels he protects Israelis living
on the border with Lebanon. Rubin said he mostly went for ``strong
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Haviv says his ambushes have never engaged Hezbollah in the
field. Rubin would not say. He added that, unlike others, he would
not scratch an ``X'' in the handle of his M-16 rifle after killing
a guerrilla.
</P>
<P>
   They both know that growing numbers of Israeli citizens and
politicians want to pull out of Lebanon, which some compare to the
United States' Vietnam War. They have lost friends in the war and
know how much their country mourns when one dies. They also know
the land in Lebanon does not mean as much to them as it does to the
Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the big advantage for them. For us it's not even worth
getting wounded,'' says Rubin, who is from Jerusalem. ``In truth, I
don't care about the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, with a budding pompadour he says his commanders will soon
tell him to clip, he wants to go to business school in Montreal
when his three years of army service are over.
</P>
<P>
   Haviv has already served his three years, but is staying on to
be an officer.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about life in the battle zone, they talk about the long
guard duties, anxious ambushes and the off hours in their bases,
when they listen to Israeli rock music and play card games of
Whist.
</P>
<P>
   And, Haviv and Rubin both speak of their respect for Hezbollah
fighters, who they said seek martyrdom but are not suicidal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very good soldiers,'' Haviv says. ``They are a very
serious enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Both the paratroopers and guerrillas discussed the difficult
ambushes, which sometimes last for days. Hezbollah's Khalil Musa
said the hardest part of his job is sitting through ambushes that
do not snare any Israelis. Hezbollah helps pay his family's bills
while he's away.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's Haviv said he feels relieved by never having confronted
guerrillas, but also that he has ``missed out.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin is glad that most of the fighting is outside of civilian
areas and therefore ``black and white.'' Anyone walking at night
where they are, he says, is a guerrilla. You have to fire first.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they believe they are going to heaven if they die killing
you, then you don't just wound them, you have to kill them,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the older Lebanese fighters, the Israelis are single.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw my father. As long as I remember he was this great
warrior,'' Haviv says. ``When I have kids, they won't have to go to
war.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Hezbollah's Musa, he faces the Israeli fort on the hill
opposite his village and says his 10 year-old boy already talks
about joining the fight. Eventually, he will let him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will follow in my way,'' he says.

<P>
   BRASHEET, Lebanon _ Nimreh Farhad's Arabic name means,
``Tigress,'' but if that kind of spirit ever lived in the old
woman's soul, it was pounded out long ago by the war in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The 84-year-old Lebanese peasant lives in the rocky hills dotted
with olive trees and farmland near territory occupied by
neighboring Israel for 17 years. It is the battleground between
Israel and the Hezbollah guerrillas, and she is shell-shocked.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Israel has stepped up its air raids. As the rumble of
bombing many miles away echoed harmlessly through Farhad's village
recently, she jumped up in fright from the small stone wall where
she sat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clear the way! Clear the way!'' she yelled, shuffling with her
weathered wooden cane toward the door of her whitewashed block
house. Her daughter tried to calm her, and neighbors explained that
she just can't take war any more.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, they are tired of the war here in Brasheet, where
dozens have died either fighting or from persistent shelling. But
so are they tired in Israel. They are tired of their youth dying in
what some consider Israel's Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure to end the war has steadily increased. On one side,
Hezbollah is gaining strength. On the other, Israeli public
opposition is building. A November Israeli newspaper poll showed a
high of 40 percent supporting a withdrawal, even without a peace
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   But, this is a complex proxy war. Syria, which borders Israel
and controls Lebanon, uses Hezbollah to pressure Israel into
returning the Golan Heights -- which Israel captured from Syria in
1967. And, Hezbollah is backed by Iran, with its own agenda for
spreading Islamic fervor. Even if Israel were to withdraw from
Lebanon, there is no guarantee that Hezbollah -- with encouragement
from Syria -- will not attack over the Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
   Peace talks between Israel and Syria have been suspended for
more than two years, and are on hold now at least until after the
May elections for Israeli prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, until a soldier is killed it isn't in the
headlines,'' says Lynn Griver, a member of the Israeli group, Four
Mothers, which has lead Israeli opposition to the war. ``This is a
stagnant time.''
</P>
<P>
   Griver, originally from New York City, used to protest against
the Vietnam War. Now, at 48, she has a son drafted into the Israeli
army who will soon head to south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   There, Israel occupies a roughly nine-mile wide band of
territory tracing back to June 1982, when Israel launched an
invasion that then-Defense Minister Ariel Sharon billed as a quick
strike against Palestine Liberation Organization terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   But, Israel kept pushing north until it placed the Lebanese
capital of Beirut under siege, killing more than 17,000 Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the PLO fled and Israel withdrew to the southern
strip that Israelis now call their ``security zone.'' From the
occupation grew a more formidable foe than the PLO; the Lebanese
who fight for the ``Party of God,'' or Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   By now, the war has settled into a blood-soaked routine.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli commandos search out guerrillas, who wait for them with
ambushes or remote-controlled, camouflaged bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese civilians build their homes with small windows for
safety. They occasionally need United Nations escorts to pick their
olives, and they can distinguish the sounds of bombs, mortar fire
or artillery.
</P>
<P>
   When civilians are killed, a five-nation committee assigns the
blame. Israel and Hezbollah occasionally exchange prisoners and
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   When Israeli forces kill civilians -- an air raid killed a
mother and six children in December -- residents in northern Israel
know to head for bomb shelters in preparation for the Hezbollah
response.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Hezbollah fired 120 rockets into Israel, killing none
but prompting Israeli strikes in return.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Israeli army, 894 of its soldiers have been
killed in Lebanon since 1982. That does not include deaths outside
the war zone, such as the 73 soldiers who died in a 1997 helicopter
collision south of the border.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah officials say they have lost about 1,400 fighters in
the war.
</P>
<P>
   As for Lebanese civilians, the war claimed 15 civilian lives in
1998, about 30 the year before and more than 200 the year in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim begins here.)
</P>
<P>
   Brasheet is a small farming community just outside of
Israeli-held territory. Within sight are mountain-top Israeli
forts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there is shooting, I can go up and look out the window,
see where the operation is and then go to the other side,'' said
34-year-old nurse Khadeja Shahab(CQ). ``Many times, we're stuck in
the house for hours and can't go out.''
</P>
<P>
   When shelling broke some of her windows recently, Hezbollah
showed up to pay for repairs.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends here.)
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah, one of the world's best-financed, best-organized
guerilla organizations in the world, gets about $200 million a year
from Iran. It is also a political party and social network with
members in the Lebanese parliament, three major hospitals, hundreds
of health clinics and schools.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the radical Shia Islamic movement that took off in the
late 1970s, Hezbollah fights Israel on behalf of the rest of
Lebanon -- the Lebanese army stays out of the war -- with an
estimated 5,000 fighters. Most are not full-time, but they showed a
leap in skill after increased training in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Israelis) are unable to hurt us badly,'' Sheikh Nabil
Kaouk, Hezbollah leader for southern Lebanon, told the Cox News
Service. ``We will keep the south here like an oven . . . until
they withdraw, they will burn.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, the Israeli Cabinet voted to accept an old U.N.
resolution calling for an Israeli withdrawal. But, the plan
requires a Lebanese commitment to stop Hezbollah from attacking
over Israel's border.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that Lebanon does not call the shots. Syria,
which has more than 35,000 troops in Lebanon, controls the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any negotiation with Israel, we are the weaker party . . .
with Syria we are much stronger,'' Lebanese Prime Minister Salim
el-Hoss told the Cox News Service in a recent interview. ``Peace
will have to wait until Syria is ready for it.''
</P>
<P>
   What Syria wants is the Golan Heights, land seen as strategic by
many Israelis. Hezbollah is Syria's vehicle for pressuring Israel,
and Syrian leaders vow not to restart peace talks until Israel
agrees it will eventually turn over the Golan, now home to some
15,000 Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a Byzantine situation where everyone is holding their
cards close to their chests and quoting the highest price,'' said
Uri Lubrani, Israel's coordinator for Lebanese affairs. ``The
parties will have to find common ground to negotiate.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Israelis fear that pulling out would let Hezbollah could come
right to its borders and launch an attack. Hezbollah purposely does
nothing to assuage those fears.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not our duty to tell Israel what will be (after a
withdrawal),'' Hezbollah's Sheikh Kaouk said. ``We are not going to
give the occupier a present when they leave.''
</P>
<P>
   That line helps Syria keep on the pressure for the Golan. It
also highlights the question of whether Hezbollah will ever give up
war to become just a political party.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with these complexities, small wonder that a growing
number of Israelis want to just leave Lebanon and see what happens.
They argue that that would both save lives and deny Syria leverage
over the Golan.
</P>
<P>
   One withdrawal plan would require a fence and radar network on
the border. If Hezbollah attacked Israel, it could use
international pressure or the threat of military attacks directly
against Syria until it reigns in Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, several leading politicians, including now-Foreign
Minister Sharon, have backed variations on the idea.
</P>
<P>
   But, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his chief
opponents in the elections see that as too risky.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli negotiator Lubrani notes that only six Israeli civilians
have died on the Lebanon border since the mid 1980s. For now, he
said, the ``security zone,'' is working.

 &HT;    BUSINESS LOBBIES SEEK TAX CUTS, SOCIAL SECURITY FIXES
 &HT;    600&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
for release Sunday, Jan. 24.
 &HT;    With CONGRESS-BUSINESS-LIST. Mug shots and logos to illustrate
the three lobbies' legislative wish lists have been placed in the
COX-CONGRESS-BUSINESS folder in the Business folder on the Cox
server.
 &HT;    BY ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Tax cuts and Social Security fixes top the
legislative wish lists of the capital's three biggest business
lobbies this year.
</P>
<P>
   When business talks, Congress listens. Committee hearings on
those topics dominate this month's limited calendar for Congress,
where impeachment has delayed floor action on all legislation until
next month.
</P>
<P>
   Ranking just below taxes and Social Security are requests for
Congress to protect businesses against lawsuits and to make sure
that health costs aren't pushed up by any moves to give more rights
to doctors and patients in managed-care programs.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the giant multi-business coalitions all have asked
Congress to block unions' efforts to raise the minimum wage and to
cover smaller businesses under the Family Leave Act, which requires
big businesses to offer unpaid time off to parents who are having a
baby or caring for a sick family member.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that point, the agenda of the National Federation of
Independent Business, which ranks third in Fortune magazine's
latest list of Washington's most powerful ``influence merchants,''
diverges somewhat from the other two. They are the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, which ranks 11th on the Fortune list, and the National
Association of Manufacturers, which ranks 13th.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the federation _ which represents small businesses
_ does not share the intense interest of the Chamber and the
manufacturers in promoting free trade. Moreover, it is a bit more
skeptical about proposals to give lawsuit protection to vendors
crippled by the Y2K computer bug.
</P>
<P>
   But the three pressure groups all share one worry and one hope
not listed on their formal political agendas for this year.
</P>
<P>
   They all worry that partisan rancor growing out of impeachment
will keep the Democratic White House and Republican-controlled
Congress from doing much at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope what we watched happen in the House last month doesn't
spread to the Senate this month,'' said Jack Faris, president of
the federation. ``The personal acrimony that could occur could
linger over and affect other issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Their joint hope is that the the nation's balanced federal
budgets and healthy economy continue for as long as possible. None
of the lobbying combines is confident that this will happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small business is successful not because of government, but in
spite of it,'' said Faris, whose federation has more than 600,000
small business owners on its membership rolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giving giving politicians credit for balancing the budget is
like giving Al Gore credit for the success of the Minnesota
Vikings,'' said William Little, chairman of the chamber, who said
96 percent of the 3 million businesses within the chamber's
affiliates have 100 or fewer employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just happened to benefit from a tidal wave of tax
revenues that rolled in because the economy has been remarkably
productive despite the high level of taxation we labor under
today,'' the Illinois businessman said. ``Simply put, the budget
was balanced on the back of American business. ``
</P>
<P>
   Deep tax cuts might preserve the economy's health, said Calvin
Campbell, another Illinois businessman. He chairs the manufacturers
association, which has 14,000 companies with 18 million employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 10 percent across-the-board tax cut for consumers and
businesses is politically reasonable because it is fair, inclusive,
affordable and will keep the expansion going as the economy slows
this year,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans endorsed such cuts. But President Clinton said
in his State of the Union speech that he would like to use most of
the upcoming budget surpluses to shore up the financing for Social
Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was disappointing to see the president embrace such a timid
tax cut agenda,'' said chamber president Thomas Donohue.
</P>
<P>
   Faris said Clinton stopped just short of a demagogic pledge of a
chicken in every pot. The president's ``pigeon-in-every-pot speech
had a lot of promises to spread (the surplus) around and spend it
all,'' Faris charged.
</P>
<P>
   But since Republicans control barely more than half the seats in
the Senate and the House, they would have a hard time coming up
with the two-thirds majorities needed to override the Democratic
president's veto of a tax bill that he considered to be
over-ambitious.
</P>
<P>
   In fixing Social Security, as well, delicate compromises would
be needed between the approach favored by most Republicans and
business lobbyists, who emphasize creation of individual investment
accounts controlled by future retirees, and the approach favored by
most Democrats and labor lobbyists, in which a government-appointed
board would invest some of the Social Security payroll taxes in
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Business people supply the vast bulk of the campaign finance
money that flows into Washington and spend another $100 million a
month on lobbying. So Congress and the White House _ whether under
Clinton or Gore _ are expected to agree to give them at least some
of what they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question about it,'' said Dan Danner, the federation's vice
president for federal public policy. ``What things we get will have
to be incremental and they will have to be bipartisan this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed to guess what will emerge, Danner mentioned minor tax
changes, such as a swifter phase-out of the estate tax, extension
of some existing tax credits and creation of some kind of
individually controlled accounts as part of the Social Security
reforms.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: BACK TO THE POLITICAL FUTURE
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Jan. 24.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In 1964, as Lyndon Johnson campaigned in Ohio, his
motorcade drove by an elderly woman propped in a wheelchair.
Somebody had put in her lap a photo taken of her as a new-born baby
while being held by Abraham Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   LBJ, who didn't miss much, ordered his caravan halted. To the
delight of all, he had the White House photographer take his
picture with the old lady.
</P>
<P>
   That poignant scene, spanning a century, came to mind when
President Clinton closed his State of the Union address by evoking
the image of another American president standing ``a hundred years
from tonight ... in this place to report on the State of the
Union.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever else informs his life nowadays, Clinton is clearly on a
millennium kick: he used the word ``century'' 36 times in his
speech. The ``new hour of healing and hopefulness'' that he aims to
leave as a legacy to a successor not yet born remains a more
problematic proposition.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, historians know quite a bit about what the
political world looked like 100 years ago, when Ohio's William
McKinley served in the White House. Elected twice, McKinley died
from an assassin's bullet early in his second term.
</P>
<P>
   In that era, presidents sent written messages to Congress. But
McKinley did deliver two inaugural address _ many of whose themes
eerily echo those now being sounded by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Edison's new motion picture camera captured McKinley's
first inaugural while his gramophone recorded it. Four years later,
McKinley, in Clintonian fashion, took credit for turning the nation
back onto prosperous path.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we assembled here on the 4th of March, 1897, there was
great anxiety with regard to our currency and credit,'' McKinley
began. ``None exists now. ...Every avenue of production is crowded
with activity, labor is well employed, and American products find
good markets at home and abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Clinton, McKinley forever was taking the public pulse. His
seizure of Cuba, Guam, Puerto Rico and the Philippines, as well as
his military thrust into China, tracked popular will, as stirred by
a rabble-rousing press. ``Uncle Joe'' Cannon of Illinois, later to
become speaker of the House, once said that McKinley kept his ear
so close to the ground that it was full of grasshoppers.
</P>
<P>
   In the White House, McKinley played host to more guests than any
of his predecessors since Andrew Jackson, while remaining deeply
protective of his invalid wife, Ida. Richly dressed, the first lady
would receive visitors at formal receptions while seated in a
velvet chair, holding a bouquet to signal that she wouldn't shake
hands.
</P>
<P>
   But a proper family life could not protect McKinley from
scandal-mongers, who professed their shock because the president
broke ground by serving wine at his first state dinner. ``His
example will destroy millions of boys, and cheat millions of women
of their heart's happiness,'' one protesting voice wrote in a
letter to the editor.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps there's an American baby somewhere who _ having slept
through Clinton's speech while his or her parents watched _ will
get to meet the president in 2100. We'll never know.

 &HT;    BUSINESS LOBBIES SEEK TAX CUTS, SOCIAL SECURITY FIXES
 &HT;    600&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
for release Sunday, Jan. 24.
 &HT;    With CONGRESS-BUSINESS-LIST. Mug shots and logos to illustrate
the three lobbies' legislative wish lists have been placed in the

 &HT;    BY ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Tax cuts and Social Security fixes top the
legislative wish lists of the capital's three biggest business
lobbies this year.
</P>
<P>
   When business talks, Congress listens. Committee hearings on
those topics dominate this month's limited calendar for Congress,
where impeachment has delayed floor action on all legislation until
next month.
</P>
<P>
   Ranking just below taxes and Social Security are requests for
Congress to protect businesses against lawsuits and to make sure
that health costs aren't pushed up by any moves to give more rights
to doctors and patients in managed-care programs.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the giant multi-business coalitions all have asked
Congress to block unions' efforts to raise the minimum wage and to
cover smaller businesses under the Family Leave Act, which requires
big businesses to offer unpaid time off to parents who are having a
baby or caring for a sick family member.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that point, the agenda of the National Federation of
Independent Business, which ranks third in Fortune magazine's
latest list of Washington's most powerful ``influence merchants,''
diverges somewhat from the other two. They are the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, which ranks 11th on the Fortune list, and the National
Association of Manufacturers, which ranks 13th.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the federation _ which represents small businesses
_ does not share the intense interest of the Chamber and the
manufacturers in promoting free trade. Moreover, it is a bit more
skeptical about proposals to give lawsuit protection to vendors
crippled by the Y2K computer bug.
</P>
<P>
   But the three pressure groups all share one worry and one hope
not listed on their formal political agendas for this year.
</P>
<P>
   They all worry that partisan rancor growing out of impeachment
will keep the Democratic White House and Republican-controlled
Congress from doing much at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope what we watched happen in the House last month doesn't
spread to the Senate this month,'' said Jack Faris, president of
the federation. ``The personal acrimony that could occur could
linger over and affect other issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Their joint hope is that the the nation's balanced federal
budgets and healthy economy continue for as long as possible. None
of the lobbying combines is confident that this will happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small business is successful not because of government, but in
spite of it,'' said Faris, whose federation has more than 600,000
small business owners on its membership rolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giving giving politicians credit for balancing the budget is
like giving Al Gore credit for the success of the Minnesota
Vikings,'' said William Little, chairman of the chamber, who said
96 percent of the 3 million businesses within the chamber's
affiliates have 100 or fewer employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just happened to benefit from a tidal wave of tax
revenues that rolled in because the economy has been remarkably
productive despite the high level of taxation we labor under
today,'' the Illinois businessman said. ``Simply put, the budget
was balanced on the back of American business. ``
</P>
<P>
   Deep tax cuts might preserve the economy's health, said Calvin
Campbell, another Illinois businessman. He chairs the manufacturers
association, which has 14,000 companies with 18 million employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 10 percent across-the-board tax cut for consumers and
businesses is politically reasonable because it is fair, inclusive,
affordable and will keep the expansion going as the economy slows
this year,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans endorsed such cuts. But President Clinton said
in his State of the Union speech that he would like to use most of
the upcoming budget surpluses to shore up the financing for Social
Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was disappointing to see the president embrace such a timid
tax cut agenda,'' said chamber president Thomas Donohue.
</P>
<P>
   Faris said Clinton stopped just short of a demagogic pledge of a
chicken in every pot. The president's ``pigeon-in-every-pot speech
had a lot of promises to spread (the surplus) around and spend it
all,'' Faris charged.
</P>
<P>
   But since Republicans control barely more than half the seats in
the Senate and the House, they would have a hard time coming up
with the two-thirds majorities needed to override the Democratic
president's veto of a tax bill that he considered to be
over-ambitious.
</P>
<P>
   In fixing Social Security, as well, delicate compromises would
be needed between the approach favored by most Republicans and
business lobbyists, who emphasize creation of individual investment
accounts controlled by future retirees, and the approach favored by
most Democrats and labor lobbyists, in which a government-appointed
board would invest some of the Social Security payroll taxes in
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Business people supply the vast bulk of the campaign finance
money that flows into Washington and spend another $100 million a
month on lobbying. So Congress and the White House _ whether under
Clinton or Gore _ are expected to agree to give them at least some
of what they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question about it,'' said Dan Danner, the federation's vice
president for federal public policy. ``What things we get will have
to be incremental and they will have to be bipartisan this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed to guess what will emerge, Danner mentioned minor tax
changes, such as a swifter phase-out of the estate tax, extension
of some existing tax credits and creation of some kind of
individually controlled accounts as part of the Social Security
reforms.

DIRECTOR STAGES COMEBACK WITH 'STILL CRAZY'

 Color slides and black and white photos of Bill Nighy and Jimmy
Nail in ``Still Crazy.''

<P>
   Who doesn't want a second chance in life? Politicians,
entertainers, boxers past their prime--all would relish another
bite at the apple.
</P>
<P>
   I remember attending Frank Sinatra's retirement concert when he
was in his late 50s and claimed he was quitting. There were, at my
count, three comebacks after that.
</P>
<P>
   In the world of rock and roll too, comebacks are a constant. Old
rockers never die, they just change their manager and have another
go at it.
</P>
<P>
   That's at the heart of the new British movie, ``Still Crazy,'' a
wonderfully funny tale about a group of middle- aged, has-been
English rockers (think the Animals or the Rolling Stones) who after
more than 20 years in oblivion decide to get together again and
take their now-slightly-rickety show on the road.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bawdy, hilarious and--surprise--emotionally touching look
at all our yesterdays.
</P>
<P>
   It stars Scottish comedian Billy Connolly, (``Mrs. Brown'',
1997) as the former road manager of the once famous rock band
Strange Fruit. Irish actor Stephen Rea--seen in ``The Crying
Game''(1992) and ``Michael Collins'' (1996)--here plays Tony, the
band's former keyboardist now fallen upon hard times and forced to
make a living stocking condom machines in Ibiza.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Nail, last seen in ``Evita'' (1996), and Bruce Robinson,
who plays the group's former lead guitarist and star who left them
after a nervous breakdown, boost a terrific ensemble cast.
</P>
<P>
   Tony (Rea) thinks his last chance of being somebody again is to
round up the boys and bring back the good old days when they had
the fans screaming in the aisles. So he shows up on the doorstep of
the band's former assistant Karen (Juliet Aubrey) and pretty soon
she's back in the bus with her teenage daughter in tow.
</P>
<P>
   The movie was scripted by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, the
California-based Brits who co-produced Alan Parker's Irish rock
movie ``The Commitments'' (1991). It's directed with great verve
and humor by Brian Gibson who is no stranger to music in movies.
His collected works include the Tina Turner story, ``What's Love
Got to Do with It'' (1993), and the film biography of the American
chanteuse Josephine Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Some who have seen ``Still Crazy,'' which opens Jan. 22 on the
coasts, nationwide Jan. 29, say the tale is reminiscent of the Rob
Reiner's l983 spoof ``rockumentary'' ``This Is Spinal Tap.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has certain similarities in that 'Spinal Tap' is about a
group that disintegrates on an American tour,'' director Gibson
agrees. ``But this is not about any particular group. It's not like
``Velvet Underground'' (l998) which clearly is a movie about David
Bowie. The rock world is full of archetypes and what Dick and Ian
did was to create five archetypes but ones that are well written
and not just cardboard cutouts or one dimensional imitations.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson says his film is about life's second chances, which he
feels old rockers have no better shot at than any of the rest of
us. ``I don't think it's easy at all for musicians to make a
comeback. They face the same spiritual challenges confronted by a
politician, an athlete or a journalist. We all have moments in our
lives where our life is dead. We might have money and family--but
there's something creatively missing and we need to prove ourselves
anew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strange Fruit made a lot of mistakes and mucked up their lives
25 years ago and fate has brought them to a second chance. What are
they gonna do with it? Blow it again?''
</P>
<P>
   Can they redeem themselves this time if only to make some sense
out of their earlier failure? This time they have a goal. It's to
appear at the 20th anniversary of the famous Wisbech open air rock
festival (shades of Woodstock) where it all began to fall apart for
them. But to make it they're going to have to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our group must examine what killed them off in the first
place,'' explains Gibson. ``In their case they were petty and
fearful and jealous of one another. They were drug-ridden. Each
character 20 years on must deal with the same issues he dealt with
then and this time break through them.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson adds: ``Almost all of us at certain points in our lives
have to make a comeback. And that's never easy. Because whatever it
is that killed us off, that took the life out of our lives, you
have to go back and find out what choice ... took us in that
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The fear and resentment of these middle-aged rockers, and their
willingness to blame anybody but themselves, are as common to
accountants and housewives as to guitarists and drummers.
</P>
<P>
   For Gibson ``Still Crazy'' marks something of a comeback--back
to the thing he does best--personal films about people, done with
wry humor and without the Hollywood touch or megastars. ``After
doing the Tina Turner movie I got a lot of opportunities in
Hollywood and I was seduced by the community,'' he admits. ``I took
on 'The Juror' in l996 (with Demi Moore) and for me it was a bad
choice. It wasn't the kind of movie I particularly enjoy doing. So
I went back to England. I wanted to do something much simpler and I
wanted to get back to my love of making movies because I'd lost
that. 'Still Crazy' gave it back to me.''

TAJ MAJAL CARRIES MUSICAL TORCH IN BLUES REVIVAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Ariz., Calif., Colo., La., N.C., Ohio, Pa., N.Y.) 
 
By RICK MITCHELL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ When Taj Mahal arrived on the national scene back in
the 1960s, soul music was in full bloom. Such artists as James
Brown, Otis Redding and Aretha Franklin had ushered in a new era in
popular music, one that reflected the hope and pride implicit in
the Civil Rights Movement.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Mahal felt out of place in the soul era; he
claimed Redding as his greatest vocal inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   But he made it his mission to ensure that previous generations
of African-American musicians _ from the acoustic Delta blues
singers of the 1920s and '30s to the urban blues pioneers of the
'40s and '50s _ weren't forgotten in the march of history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Receiving the torch of our musical ancestors and giving it
back is what a musical life is all about,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tendency in this country is to look at these blues players
as these sort of simple little humanoids who are three-fifths of a
person but can play this emotional stuff that really takes us back
to the beginning of our primordial whatever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I happen to think that these folks _ some of whom didn't have
even a first-grade education _ came up with some poetry and some
musical innovation that has stood the test of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, how much schooling did Robert Johnson have? And the
longer we try to figure out what he did, the more we realize this
guy was an amazing wizard.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahal subsequently has broadened his reach to encompass
Afro-Caribbean music, as well as more modern forms of rhythm and
blues. His latest album, ``Sacred Island,'' is an unprecedented
fusion of black American and Hawaiian folk styles.
</P>
<P>
   But he remains most closely identified with the itinerant
singer-songwriter tradition of Johnson, that of the rural bluesman
moving from town to town, with only a guitar and perhaps a
harmonica for accompaniment.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Mahal will carry the torch for some musical
ancestors who are still very much alive when he headlines the
Winston Blues Revival at Big John's Ice House, a Houston venue that
can seat up to several hundred fans.
</P>
<P>
   The tour, sponsored by RJ Reynolds Tobacco, also features
venerable Southern blues musicians Beverly ``Guitar'' Watkins,
Cootie Stark and Neal Pattman. Proceeds support the Music Maker
Relief Foundation, a North Carolina-based organization that
provides emergency financial assistance to aging blues musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``In four hours, you get a good overview of American blues,''
says Music Maker founder Tim Duffie, who has spent the past decade
doing field recordings of obscure Southern blues players. These
previously have been released in cooperative ventures with other
labels but will soon be available on the new Music Maker label.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first band is Mudcat, a young white band from Atlanta with
a deep knowledge of the tradition. Then Neal Pattman plays solo
harmonica, joined by Taj on acoustic bass. Cootie demonstrates the
East Coast Piedmont tradition. I play some slide guitar with him.
Then Taj comes out with his piano and guitar; then Beverly
''Guitar`` Watkins demonstrates that stomping, feel-good R&AMP;B
tradition. At the end of the show, we have a free-for-all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a grass-roots tour. The only seasoned professional is Taj
Mahal. Thank God he's there with us, steadying us down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Taj Mahal was born Henry Fredricks 56 years ago in Harlem. His
father was a respected part-time jazz musician; his mother was a
gospel-singing schoolteacher. He grew up in a multiethnic
neighborhood in Springfield, Mass., where he absorbed the
influences of jazz, blues and gospel, Caribbean calypso and various
forms of folk music from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a full individual and was well aware of that as a child,''
he says. ``My parents made sure that I was connected to the world,
with respect for other people's cultures as well as my culture. I
heard the sound of humanity in a bigger swath than most people.
It's only in looking back that I've realized that.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from the University of Massachusetts in 1964
with a degree in animal husbandry, he gravitated to the folk scene.
In 1965, he formed a band with Ry Cooder called the Rising Sons.
This led to solo recording contract.
</P>
<P>
   By the late '60s, Mahal had built an audience among hip white
rockers on the strength of early albums such as ``The Natch'l
Blues.'' But he has never had a mainstream rhythm and blues
following, which still bothers him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black music in the United States has been shaped not by the
people, but by the seller. One time, it was our taste in music that
everybody came up uptown, or downtown, or across the tracks, to
hear the real deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``But once it became popular, it no longer belonged to the
people who started it. It belongs to the guy who can figure out how
to market it to you. It was perceived that blues was no longer
marketable to black people in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision was made at a corporate level that Taj Mahal,
basically, didn't have any soul. That's just the patronizing way
it's been set up in this country from the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Mahal has persevered and prospered creatively. His
recorded catalog includes more than 50 albums, including
compilations, European releases and joint projects with other
artists. Last year, Columbia Records issued the three-disc boxed
set, ``Taj Mahal: In Progress &AMP; In Motion, 1965-1998.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he could easily headline his own tour at a more
prestigious venue, Mahal says he's proud to lend his support to the
Music Maker Relief Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This organization is already dealing with at least 70 blues
musicians, men and women who perhaps made some records back in the
'30s or '40s or even the '50s and then nobody's heard of them
since,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``And yet they still maintain a good ability to play their music
and put on a show.''
</P>
<P>
   The first batch of Music Maker albums is due at the end of this
month and includes releases by Stark, Pattman and the late Guitar
Gabriel. The recordings will be distributed by nationally by
Sire/Warner Bros.
</P>
<P>
   As for RJ Reynolds' sponsorship, Mahal makes no apologies. He
points out that itinerant bluesmen often followed the tobacco
harvest around the Southeast. He's happy to see that the tobacco
industry has chosen to give some money back.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big corporation put up some money and said, `You guys can
play your music the way you want to play it, and we'll support
it,''' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is window-dressing for them, fine. Let it be that. The
fact of the matter is, where are you, Westinghouse? Where are you
General Motors? Where are you CNN?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is American music. This is traditional, cultural. This
belongs to us in this century, and it now belongs to the whole
world of humanity. The blues is a voice that will go on into the
future.''

<P>
   BEIJING _ When retired biologist Chen Linna was a 14-year-old
schoolgirl, her nights were tormented by a dream: must she kill her
father as a ``criminal'' who betrayed his country?
</P>
<P>
   Walking home from school one day, Chen had read a wall poster
pasted in her courtyard that denounced her father as a ``bourgeois
rightist.'' Soon expelled from the ruling Communist Party, her
father was shipped off for a year to one of China's original labor
camps.
</P>
<P>
   That was in 1957. Today, she says the stain of the ``rightist''
label has never quite disappeared from her father's career -- or
hers. Last year, he died at the age of 84, officially
``rehabilitated'' but still bitter.
</P>
<P>
   Now, less than a year later, the historical fate of Chen and the
550,000 others in the first generation of accused Chinese
dissidents has finally come up for debate within the Communist
Party.
</P>
<P>
   In a further irony, the party is deciding whether to expunge the
guilt of this dwindling core of ``rightists'' even as it is
aggressively cracking down on today's new generation of dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   With China approaching the 50th anniversary of the communist
takeover in October, ranking party officials have told Western
visitors about a still-secret documentary that is said to make a
powerful case that the party wrongly persecuted the ``rightists''
42 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The film was previewed for senior leaders and party historians
at a recent study session at the Central Committee's Party School
in northern Beijing, according to one visitor, Professor Robert
Pastor of Emory University in Atlanta. Pastor said he learned of it
from a senior Beijing party official during the Carter Center's
recent trip to observe Chinese township elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt he was never fully rehabilitated -- emotionally,''
said daughter Chen, now 56, when she heard about the secret film.
</P>
<P>
   The decision on whether to overturn the 1957 verdicts by party
tribunals poses an exquisite dilemma to today's Communist Party,
which exercises a hollow power with neither ideological or moral
force over 1.2 billion people.
</P>
<P>
   A full denunciation of the anti-rightist campaign might bring
some new legitimacy to the party -- but at great risks, said
Harvard University China scholar Roderick MacFarquhar(CQ). It might
help revive patriotism among a generation of sons and daughters
repelled by the hostility to intellectuals so long displayed by the
party, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the strongest arguments against removing the stigma from
the ``rightists'' is the need to protect the reputation of the late
Deng Xiaoping. Deng, the former Chinese leader, remains a revered
symbol for today's top communists for thrusting China onto its
winning path of market-oriented ``reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that in 1957, Deng was Chairman Mao Tse-tung's
chief hatchetman in the ``anti-rightist'' crackdown. By some
reputable accounts, it was Deng who convinced Mao to open the first
labor camps.
</P>
<P>
   Then after Mao's death, Deng pressured the party to declare in
1980 that the anti-rightist campaign ``was not erroneous in itself,
the problem was that it became inflated.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why few experts expect that a documentary fully
repudiating the ``rightist'' crackdown will ever be broadcast in
China.
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagine that many party members would be dead set against
opening a Pandora's box,'' MacFarquhar said in an e-mail interview
with the Cox News Service. ``It would further undermine the
Chairman, and also Deng Xiaoping, thus bringing into question not
merely the Maoist era but even the Dengist.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy remains so painful for the party because the
``rightists'' included some of the best and brightest in Mao's
revolution. China's current premier and economic czar Zhu Rongji
was one of the few ``rightists'' who endured the purge and went on
to rise to top leadership.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the noted revolutionary novelist Ding Ling stopped
writing for two decades and never fully regained her vitality.
Then-campus activist Harry Wu emerged from his ``rightist'' labor
camp to go into exile, then turned into one of China's most
vituperative critics in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Chen's father, Chen Shiwu, was swept up almost by
accident in the ``rightist'' purge.
</P>
<P>
   At Mao's revolutionary base at Yan'an in the 1940s, both Chen's
father and mother were part of the entourage as revolutionary
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   After Mao came to power on Oct. 1, 1949, Chen's father was
dispatched to communist East Berlin as chief correspondent of
China's official Xinhua news service. He returned to China in 1955
and was promoted to chief of Xinhua's international department.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1956, Mao signalled a period of liberalization. ``Let
100 Flowers Bloom, Let 100 Schools Contend,'' was Mao's slogan.
Writers and intellectuals were invited to help improve the party by
criticizing it.
</P>
<P>
   Journalist Chen never said anything provocative, at least as far
as his family recalls. His apparent mistake was associating too
closely with his older brother, Chen Qixia, a well-known and
outspoken member of the Chinese Writers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Mao slammed shut the ``100 Flowers'' period after rebellion
broke out in Poland in June 1956, followed that autumn by the
abortive Hungarian anti-communist revolution.
</P>
<P>
   For young daughter Chen Linna, the 1957 ``anti-rightist''
crackdown began with a front-page blast in People's Daily against
her father's brother, then the shocking wall poster attacking her
father.
</P>
<P>
   Soon teachers pressured her to denounce him during humiliating
``self-criticism'' sessions at school. ``I always felt that I was a
criminal when I faced the Communist Party,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After a year in a labor camp, her father was freed and sent back
to Beijing around 1959 in a low-status job at the news agency. When
the Cultural Revolution erupted in 1966, his ``rightist'' brand
brought him another two years in a labor camp. Around 1980 he was
declared ``rehabilitated'' and let back into the party, but his
journalistic rise was finished.
</P>
<P>
   By then, daughter Chen Linna had long since lost her chance for
a fast-track career. Because her father was a ``rightist,'' she was
banned from the Young Communist League in high school. That meant
she never became a Communist Party member nor was allowed into the
Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   She managed to fight her way into the Beijing Forestry Institute
and graduate as a biologist. She was assigned to work in a remote
mountainous outpost near Inner Mongolia, 100 miles from the nearest
rail station.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 30 years she served her time in one place and
another, then retired last year. Now she lives in a two-room
Beijing apartment with her octogenarian father-in-law and her
unemployed daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite late,'' she said softly, as she pondered how her
life would change if the party does decide to vindicate the
rightists.

PONTIFF TO SEE STRONGER CHURCH-STATE TIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Maria Lozano remembers when her mother instructed
her to never tell strangers that she attended a Catholic school.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the church and government were so tense in
those days that one never knew when volunteering such information
could lead to trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's different now,'' Lozano, a 55-year-old grandmother,
said Wednesday while standing in front of a church in the southern
neighborhood of Coyoacan, where the Spanish conqueror Hernan Cortes
established one of the country's first Catholic settlements. ``It's
not a problem to say you're Catholic. Things are much better
today.''
</P>
<P>
   When he first set foot on Mexican soil 20 years ago this month,
Pope John Paul II encountered the country's greatest paradox _ a
devoutly Catholic land with one of the most anticlerical
constitutions.
</P>
<P>
   During his fourth visit to Mexico that begins Friday, the
pontiff will see how much the church-state ties have tightened,
mostly during his papacy.
</P>
<P>
   Where monasteries were once officially considered illegal, they
now operate freely. Where priests were once forbidden to vote and
wear their collars in public, they are now considered key political
figures. And where parochial education was once banned, rich and
poor alike enroll their children in the growing numbers of Roman
Catholic schools.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, most of the strict, antireligious laws that were
once a cornerstone of the country's revolution-era constitution
went quietly ignored by church and government. But they underscored
the hostility that festered between the two ever since modern
Mexico was born 80 years ago from the struggle between peasant
insurgents and Catholic aristocrats.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship today between church and state is still often
filled with tension, particularly when bishops and government
officials clash over sensitive issues such as the unresolved Indian
rebellion in Chiapas, free-market economic policies that have
created more poverty, or Mexico's spotty human rights record. But
those debates now occur in public.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the pope's five-day visit to Mexico City will focus on
delivering a new vision for the church in the Americas, including
its involvement in political and social issues and how to compete
against the growing popularity of protestant denominations.
</P>
<P>
   But many are also wondering whether he will make any direct
remarks on more controversial issues. President Ernesto Zedillo's
government, which expelled six foreign priests from Chiapas and
blamed the church for fomenting violence there, was concerned
enough about the possibility that the pope might talk about the
southern state that last month it sent its chief negotiator to
brief Vatican officials.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico, which with about 88 million Catholics has the world's
second highest concentrations of Catholics, is considered a crucial
bridge for the church between North America, which has become more
secular, and Latin America, which is becoming more Protestant.
</P>
<P>
   Since the arrival of the Spaniards in the 16th century, it has
been a predominately Catholic country. The Basilica of Guadalupe in
Mexico City, a tribute to the country's patron saint, an Indian
version of the Virgin Mary, is the second-most visited Catholic
church in the world after the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   After the country won its independence from the Spanish crown in
1821, church and government battled constantly, as religious
conservatives fought against intellectual liberals for power. The
1857 constitution, which was written by liberals, stripped the
church of most of its colonial-era powers.
</P>
<P>
   Within a decade, the church's political power had been
completely removed.
</P>
<P>
   But the most gruesome chapters in Mexico's church-state saga
were still to come. After the 1910-1917 revolution, President
Plutarco Elias Calles, founder of the Institutional Revolutionary
Party, placed the church under state control and strictly enforced
the country's anticlerical laws.
</P>
<P>
   That gave rise to the Cristero War, in which scores of priests
were killed, public church services were halted, and peasant
Catholics took up arms chanting ``Viva Cristo Rey,'' ``Long live
Christ the King.'' The crackdown and its accompanying violence
framed British author Graham Greene's classic novel, ``The Power
and the Glory.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, with as many as 90 percent of Mexicans claiming to
be Catholic, the church has maintained a powerful presence in every
aspect of society.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has always misunderstood the mythology and
mysticism of the church and what it has meant to the people,'' said
Roderic Ai Camp, a professor at Claremont McKenna College in
California who published a book last year on religion and politics
in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The dismantling of the wall around the Catholic church in Mexico
began in the mid-1970s when former President Luis Echeverria met
with Pope Paul VI. But it wasn't until 1990, the year that John
Paul II made his second visit to Mexico, that a repeal of the
constitution's five antichurch articles was taken up by congress.
</P>
<P>
   The repeal was signed in 1992 by then-President Carlos Salinas
de Gotari. A year later, during the pope's third Mexico visit,
Salinas reestablished diplomatic ties with the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   The bonds have remained respectful during the Zedillo
administration, but have suffered from the strain of the ongoing
Chiapas predicament _ which the government blames church officials
for fomenting _ recurring discussions over legalizing abortions and
the still unsolved murder six years ago of Cardinal Juan Jesus
Posadas Ocampo, who was fatally shot in Guadalajara.
</P>
<P>
   Although the church is more socially and politically active
today in Mexico, some leaders wonder whether the pope, who has
advocated less involvement in such matters, might urge members to
be less vocal and more spiritual.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would seem ironic that now when we have more freedom to
speak freely as Catholics that our pope, our leader, would ask us
to stop speaking out,'' said one parish priest in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   But in the eyes of Sebastian Carranza, a 38-year-old musician
who in a plaza near the Coyoacan church, changes in the church are
as inevitable as the changes he's seen in his government's attitude
toward it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country and the government have gradually changed to
become more sophisticated and more open,'' Carranza said. ``Maybe
it's time for the Catholic church to change a little bit. If it
does, maybe I'll go back.''

HOW WILL THEY DECIDE? BY THEIR OWN STANDARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It is a trial unlike any other, and nowhere is that
more evident than in this: Every senator in the Clinton trial is
free to impose his or her own legal standard for judging whether
the president should be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   So Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Republican from Texas, says
she plans to use ``a very high standard'' in determining how to
vote on the impeachment charges. Senator Thad Cochran, a Republican
from Mississippi, is looking for ``clear and convincing evidence.''
And Senator Max Cleland, a Democrat from Georgia, is one of a
half-dozen members of both parties who said he hadn't decided yet.
</P>
<P>
   This is how the framers of the Constitution wanted it,
underlining their intent for impeachment to be a political as well
as a legal process. As a result, however, it adds what GOP Senator
Frank Murkowski of Alaska called ``a certain awkwardness'' to the
final deliberations, because every lawmaker will be sitting in
judgment using different criteria.
</P>
<P>
   This lack ofa clear standard for assessing the evidence against
Clinton makes the job more difficult than in other trials for both
the prosecution and defense.
</P>
<P>
   In criminal trials, the burden is on the prosecution to prove a
case to the jury ``beyond a reasonable doubt,'' while in civil
trials lawyers must demonstrate that a far less demanding
``preponderance of the evidence'' favors their version of events.
</P>
<P>
   ``From both the prosecution and defense point of view, it does
create a problem because it creates a moving target,'' said Alan
Baron, who was the House's special counsel for the impeachment of
two federal judges. ``It really does take you outside the
mainstream of how one normally argues a case.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles F.C. Ruff, the chief White House counsel, referred to
the senators' choice of standards during his opening presentation
Tuesday. Asserting that the removal of a president ``must be a last
resort,'' he implored senators to raise the bar of judgment as high
as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Neither senators nor legal scholars interviewed Wednesday
agreed, however, that Ruff's reading of the Constitution was
necessarily correct. Rather, they said the document's authors
deliberately provided wide latitude so senators can consider
factors ranging from their constituents' wishes to their own moral
views in casting a final vote.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a Democrat from Connecticut, said
he had applied a middle-ground standard of ``clear and convincing
evidence'' when he approved the impeachment of a judge. He added,
however, that he still had not decided whether that was sufficient
for the ouster of a president.
</P>
<P>
   In any other legal case, Lieberman said, it would be logical for
all the jurors to be operating under the same guidelines. ``But
this is an uncommon political-legal experience that creates its own
rules.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the senators can apply their own standard in
deciding the allegations of perjury and obstruction of justice
lodged against Clinton, and if they believe him guilty, in
determining whether the charges reach the level of ``high crimes
and misdemeanors'' required for removal.
</P>
<P>
   Baron and most others interviewed said they thought the result
ends up being fair, because both prosecutors and defense attorneys
have to operate with the same uncertainty. And Michael Malbin,
director of political and legislative studies at the Rockefeller
Institute at the University of New York-Albany, predicted that most
senators _ especially those not at the partisan extremes _ would be
far more rigorous and less arbitrary in applying their individual
standards than some observers might expect.
</P>
<P>
   But former Watergate prosecutor Richard Ben-Veniste said that,
whatever the intent, the defendant suffers anytime his lawyers
don't have prescribed guidelines for establishing innocence _ an
argument White House attorney Gregory Craig echoed during his
presentation Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is inconsistent with most people's view of fairness
for the standards not to be clear in terms of the burden of
proof,'' said Ben-Veniste.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Parnet, a professor of constitutional law at Boston
University Law School, likened the senators' latitude to the
discretion of judges in rendering decisions or giving instructions
to jurors. To view the process clearly, Parnet suggested thinking
of the senators as justices on the Supreme Court, each able to file
concurring or dissenting opinions citing different reasons _ but
the bottom-line vote is recorded with simple ``yeas'' or ``nays.''
</P>
<P>
   Parnet said this again illustrates that the framers of the
Constitution meant for senators to transcend the roles of typical
jurors. It also helps explain why the senators can engage in
activities, such as watching news accounts of their trial, that are
prohibited for most jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if that logic extended to senators talking publicly about
the ongoing impeachment case, Parnet jokingly replied: ``I have to
say we probably would impeach some judges for doing what the
senators are doing.''

_A CHALLENGE TO VIEWS ON FIBER, CANCER RISK   
 _DRUGS, INSEMINATION: A PATH TO PREGNANCY?   
 _LINKING CANCER, RACE: US SEEKS CLOSER LOOK  
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   &UR; A challenge to views on fiber, cancer risk
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are still good reasons to eat fiber, but reducing the risk
of colorectal cancer isn't one of them, says a major study released
this week.
</P>
<P>
   For years, many people believed fiber could ward off colorectal
cancer, perhaps by speeding the passage of food, including
potential carcinogens, through the digestive tract.
</P>
<P>
   But the evidence for the cancer-reducing powers of fiber has
been mixed. Three studies in recent years, for instance, have found
no reduction in risk among people who took fiber supplements. A
1997 study of more than 16,000 men has found no link between
dietary fiber and adenomas, a kind of precancerous polyp, and in
1994, a related study of 47,000 men found no link between fiber and
colorectal cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The new study, by researchers at Brigham and Women's Hospital in
Boston and published in the New England Journal of Medicine, is
based on an analysis of more than 88,000 women ages 34 to 59 who
were followed for 16 years as part of the Nurses' Health Study.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found no link between fiber intake and reduction
of risk of colorectal cancer or adenomas, ``even among participants
who consistently consumed high levels of fiber,'' said the study
leader, Dr. Charles Fuchs, an associate physician at Brigham and
Women's.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was there no protective effect of fiber, there was also
an unexpected, modest increased risk of cancer among women who ate
the most vegetable fiber, a risk that was not found for fiber from
fruits and cereals.
</P>
<P>
   Still, research shows there are benefits to fiber, including
lower risk of heart disease, hypertension, a bowel problem called
diverticulitis, and noninsulin dependent diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number one cause of death for Americans is coronary heart
disease. Anything that can reduce that is important, and fiber does
that,'' Fuchs said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Drugs, insemination: A path to pregnancy?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fertility drugs used in combination with artificial insemination
of sperm into the uterus are more likely than several other methods
to achieve pregnancy, researchers from 10 medical centers say in
the current New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The team, led by researchers from the University of Rochester in
New York, studied 932 couples in which the women had no clear
reason for infertility and the men had viable sperm. They found the
pregnancy rate over four menstrual cycles was three times higher
when the women took drugs to stimulate egg production and the man's
sperm was placed into the uterus than when the man's sperm was
simply placed into the vagina and the woman took no fertility
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The use of fertility drugs plus intrauterine insemination was
also slightly more effective than intrauterine insemination alone
or than intracervical insemination plus fertility drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But Dutch researchers, in an accompanying editorial, stressed
that many couples are too quick to assume they are infertile. While
a third of the couples in the study who used fertility drugs plus
intrauterine insemination conceived within six months, ``a similar
result would have been obtained in couples like these if they had

fertility drugs and intrauterine insemination before leaping to
higher tech procedures, couples should understand the risks of

   The analysis found that for unclear reasons, African-American
men develop cancer 15 percent more often than white men; that
African-American women are less likely to get breast cancer than

Asian-Americans are at higher than average risk for stomach and

WOOD STAIN MAY VANISH WHEN VARNISHED

   Q. My husband is building a house on the Cape. He sealed the
indoor trim with a sealer, then applied a Minwax cherry stain. Now
white splotches have appeared in the cherry stain, not all over but
enough to be annoying. How can he get rid of those white marks?
</P>
<P>
   JANE BAKER, Canton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Sounds as if it is a water stain, but where is the water
coming from? If the Minwax stain is water-based, it might be due to
that. Minwax is one of the better stains, especially the
penetrating oil stains.
</P>
<P>
   Treat the white stains with a solution of 1 part bleach to 5 or
6 parts water. Try an obscure area of the trim. If that works, then
you can rinse and varnish.
</P>
<P>
   Some white stains in wood will disappear when varnished. Select
an obscure area of the trim and apply one coat of an oil-based
polyurethane varnish. If the stains disappear, continue with two
thin coats of the varnish.

   Ruffles. Not ruffles and flourishes but ruffles. Dust ruffles,
in fact. That is the answer that no less than three callers and one
writer suggested to solve the problem of K.K. of Framingham, Mass.,
whose new mattress and box spring was extra thick, making her
bedspread too narrow to cover the bed properly.
</P>
<P>
   K.K. called to ask what she could do about that narrow
bedspread. The handyman had several complicated suggestions that
would work, such as lowering the Harvard frame (cut the legs) or
building a thinner box spring.
</P>
<P>
   But wouldn't you know, those three callers and one writer
suggested a dust ruffle, one that fits around the box spring,
allowing the narrow bedspread to cover it. Problem solved, easily
and inexpensively. Why didn't I think of that!
</P>
<P>
   The three callers are Jane Ellis of Milton, Barbara Coyle of
Kingston, and Beverly Menzer of Mansfield, Mass. Coyle said you can
get two kinds of ruffle: One goes all the way over the box spring,
another is just a border. The one that covers the box spring is
best, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The writer is D. Smith of Hampton, N.H., who said such items
don't have to be ruffled; they can be plain or tailored, and come
in different lengths to meet the floor.
</P>
<P>
   And, to add insult to injury, the handyman had a similar problem
last year. It took the handyman's wife to figure that ruffles would
solve it. Right on, all you nice people, and Lucia.

   Q. I have snow on the roof, which is right and proper in the
winter, meaning the attic floor is well insulated and the attic is
well ventilated. However, there is no snow from just above the
skylights to the ridge vent, meaning that the roof areas above the
skylights are warm, and I am concerned about ice dams. Is there
anything I can do?
</P>
<P>
   PUZZLED CALLER
</P>
<P>
   A. Hmm. Assuming the skylights are on a cathedral ceiling (no
attic below the roof), I have two theories:
</P>
<P>
   --There is insulation in the roof above the skylghts, but no
moving air, because there is no vent at the low end of the roof,
just above the skylight; therefore the air is warm.
</P>
<P>
   --Incredible as it may seem, perhaps there is no insulation in
that roof space.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing I can think of is to put small roof vents just
above the skylights, which will provide continuous air flow from
bottom to top (through the ridge vent). Or, do nothing; it is
unlikely you will get ice dams in those areas, and even if you do,
a proper roof job would prevent dammed water from coming through
the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I put a 5-inch-wide hole in my ceiling when I redid a room,
removing the old plaster and wood lath. The ceiling looks and feels
like concrete. How can I fill that hole?
</P>
<P>
   DAN McLAUGHLIN, Brighton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. If the ceiling looks and feels like concrete, it probably is.
If you can see wire lath in the hole, simply fill it with mortar;
you may have to put in more than one layer. When you get the mortar
nearly level with the ceiling, or a little below it, wait 15
minutes then rub with a wood float (a wood or hard foam-faced
trowel), or a rough piece of wood. This should match the current
ceiling. You can buy Sacrete or Quickcrete mortar mix at lumber
stores.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no wire lath, you can staple some onto any joist
that shows. If no joist is showing, make the hole bigger to expose
at least one joist and staple wire lath or hardware cloth (
1/4-inch steel mesh); this lath or mesh will hold the mortar in
place.
</P>
<P>
   If the ceiling is plaster and not mortar, you could do the same
with the wire lath or hardware cloth and fill the hole with
spackling compound, patching plaster, or joint compound. If the
hole is more than 1/2-inch deep, you should apply the plaster in
thin layers. If you don't do this, the patch will crack and fail
quickly. Apply the plaster about 1/4-inch thick for starters, and
as it sets up, score it with a fork or the point of a trowel. This
scoring will allow the next coat to stick better.
</P>
<P>
   To match the scroll or design of the ceiling, paint it with a
texture paint and make the scrolls with a stiff, dry brush. For a
stucco look, press a sponge in the wet paint.

GETTING A LINE ON PHONE USE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One night last week, high school junior Zoe Spivak talked to
three friends on the phone. From the time of the first call at 7:15
until she hung up from the last one at 11, she spent two hours and
15 minutes talking. It was, she says, a typical night.
</P>
<P>
   Zoe's phone time is not unusual; American teens average two to
three hours on the phone daily, according to a University of
Illinois study. But Zoe may be unusual in another way: Her
telephone time doesn't drive her parents crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a struggle in the beginning, until I remembered how
much talking to friends meant to me when I was her age,'' says her
mother, Janet Schwartz. ``I could see she needs this, just the way
preschoolers need a play gym in the back yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists echo this insight. ``The telephone is a lifeline,
a facilitator, for teens,'' says child and adolescent psychologist
Sharon Gordetsky, president of the Massachusetts Psychological
Association. She urges parents not to have a knee-jerk reaction to
phone use, rather to understand and evaluate the role it plays for
your child.
</P>
<P>
   For young teens especially, the phone can widen social networks
and promote age-appropriate risk-taking, including the most basic
risk of all, talking to someone of the opposite sex. On the phone,
you can socialize with a boy or girl without having to make eye
contact, without having your hands and feet betray how nervous you
are.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's liberating. It gives a child control and confidence,''
says psychologist Ann Evans, director of the Family Support Program
for the Judge Baker Children's Center.
</P>
<P>
   Once a teen is comfortable doing that, he'll take an even
greater risk on the phone by sharing intimacies. In this way, the
phone promotes personal growth. ``They learn what information they
want to share and how to cope with reactions they get,'' says
Evans.
</P>
<P>
   The phone also becomes a vehicle for separation. It's this piece
that can be hardest for some parents. ``Every call is another
reminder that you're `out' and the person on the phone is `in,' ''
says Robin Deutsch, a child psychologist at Massachusetts General
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can react out of your hurt, which means you react in
anger, or you can see the phone for what it is: a tool of
adolescence,'' says Deutsch.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's not all that simple, even for parents who do
respect the role the phone plays. The need to call a friend the
second she walks in the door, even though they just parted; the
back-and-forth calls to tell Jen what Em said and Em what Jen said
and then get back to Jen again; the insistence that you have to get
off the phone because she's expecting a call _ this all can make
parents see red.
</P>
<P>
   Gordetsky doesn't back down. ``Teens have a developmental need
to check in with each other, to reaffirm their place in the group.
They get panicky at the prospect of being left out.''
</P>
<P>
   It's for this reason that Gordetsky and others advise not to
arbitrarily restrict use. Families do need limits around phone use,
but limits work best when they are arrived at together.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real mistake not to give a teen input into this,'' says
psychologist Anne Petersen, who specializes in adolescent
development at the W.K. Kellogg Foundation. If you don't already
have a family meeting, this is the time to establish one,
especially in families with several children vying for the phone.
</P>
<P>
   There are three goals, she says: to show that everyone's needs
matter within the family; that conflicts can be worked out
rationally; and that a teen is responsible for his behavior within
the family. Before the meeting, ask everyone to write down issues
they think need to be agreed to. Here are topics typically need to
be resolved:
</P>
<P>
   --Time and conditions for phone use: How late can calls come
in/go out? Does homework have to be done before phone time? Can it
be done on the phone?
</P>
<P>
   --Amount of phone time: How much per child per day?
</P>
<P>
   --Call waiting: If you have it, circumstances for when you
do/don't have to pick it up.
</P>
<P>
   --Messages: Rules for writing down/conveying messages to other
people including taking messages off a machine.
</P>
<P>
   --Outgoing calls: What happens if someone needs to make a call
during your phone time?
</P>
<P>
   --Privacy: Agree to honor it, with possible exceptions (more on
this below).
</P>
<P>
   --What if's: Allow for contingencies, for instance, Mark has a
question about homework but it's John's phone time.
</P>
<P>
   --Consequences for violations: Agree to these in advance. If his
time is up, can someone pull the plug? If she's repeatedly overused
her time, is it reduced for a day? A week? What if grades drop?
</P>
<P>
   Petersen says parents may want to establish some ``givens,'' for
instance, that telephone use is a privilege predicated upon certain
grades. Deutsch tells parents to factor a child's temperament into
consideration, too. ``Some kids are too anxious to focus on
homework if social connections are dangling; for them, it's better
to get phone time over with after school,'' she says. ``Others
can't get off the phone once they get on. They need to wait to talk
until after homework and chores.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you can afford a second phone line, there's no reason not to
get it, says Petersen, assuming there are limits around its use. If
you can't or don't want a second line, she recommends working out
joint use in a way that respects your teen's need, telling her, for
instance: ``I need the phone between 7 and 9 for work calls. Let's
figure out how we can make this work for both of us.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as teens want and parents need to grant privacy, there
are times when you may wonder if you should get involved. For
instance:
</P>
<P>
   --He gets off the phone and is clearly upset. The most you can
do, says Deutsch, is make yourself available: ``You seem upset from
that call. I'm happy to listen, if you want.''
</P>
<P>
   --You overhear gross generalizations that are antithetical to
your family's values. Although some of this is bravado that comes
with the muscle-flexing the telephone offers, it never hurts to
reiterate family values at an appropriate time. Don't relate it to
what you've heard, however.
</P>
<P>
   --You overhear friendship woes about who's included and who's
not. ``Stay out of it,'' urges Evans. ``By the time you figure out
what's what, it'll have changed again.''
</P>
<P>
   --What you overhear involves someone's health or safety. Be
honest, says Deutsch: ``I didn't mean to listen, but I heard what
you said about John. It sounds like the kind of thing you need
adult help with. It doesn't have to be me, but I need to know you
will talk to some adult.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Schwartz-Spivak family, where there are two phone lines,
they've successfully negotiated many issues, including joint use of
the second line, which is primarily Zoe's. ``In the beginning, I
wanted to know who was calling. I don't ask anymore,'' says
Schwartz. Zoe can make outgoing calls as late as she wants, as long
as homework is done, but she isn't allowed incoming calls after 10
and, says her mother, ``if the phone rings at 1 a.m., she agrees
one of us can say, `You shouldn't be calling now.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Zoe mostly talks to the same two best friends, sometimes to do
homework together, sometimes not even to talk, just to have the
lines open. ``It feels good when the connection is there,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIPS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --For some teens, Internet ``buddy groups,'' where friends
arrange e-mail conversations, serve the same purpose as talking on
the phone. Similar limits should be agreed to.
</P>
<P>
   --If your teen has his own line, consider putting blocks on
options such as call waiting, caller ID, and call forwarding.
</P>
<P>
   --It's OK for a teen to help defray phone charges using money
he's saved but not to get a job just to pay for a phone line.
</P>
<P>
   --Some kids never like to talk on the phone except for a
specific purpose. As long as he connects to peers, don't worry
about him. A teen who gets no calls, however, may be isolated and
lonely. Encourage him to make a call for homework help or to seek a
classmate's opinion. If he seems socially isolated in all ways,
seek professional advice.
</P>
<P>
   --Use objective measures like poor grades or falling asleep in
class to negotiate changes in telephone policy.
</P>
<P>
   --It's OK for your teen to use you as the heavy: ``My mother
says you can't call here more than three times a night.''
</P>
<P>
   --When siblings share a phone, encourage them to negotiate
squabbles themselves, for instance, by trading phone time: ``You
can have my time today if I can have yours Friday.'' Siblings of
different ages should have different phone-time allowances.
</P>
<P>
   --Sugggested phone-time allowances (to be used after homework or
other responsibilities): 11-to-13-year-olds, 20 minutes a day; 13-
and 14-year-olds, 40 minutes; 15 and older, one to two hours.
</P>
<P>
   --Use a kitchen timer to time calls.
</P>
<P>
   --Post phone rules.
</P>
<P>
   --Beepers and cell phones are variations on the theme and need
specific, agreed-to limits around their use. (If he gets beeped in
the middle of class, he can't answer.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AFTERTHOUGHT _ When you go back to work after maternity leave
and get a frantic call from your caregiver that your 3-month-old
has been crying for 40 minutes, try a long-distance rescue, where
you sing or coo to him over the phone. From ``365 Ways to Calm Your
Crying Baby'' by Julian Orenstein (Adams Media Corp.)

CHAT GETS REAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Fixing headline)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; As a younger, dumber man, I wasted hundreds of hours and
dollars hanging around in chat rooms on the CompuServe on-line
service, typing messages in real time to other users of the
network. You paid a dime a minute back then, and the massive
CompuServe bills _ along with the massive idiocy of on-line
conversations _ soured me on Internet chat for the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why I've left the issue of on-line chat pretty much
alone, until now.
</P>
<P>
   A lot has changed since I gave up on chat. Cheap Internet access
lets you chat your life away for $20 a month on Internet Relay
Chat, a worldwide network used by tens of thousands every day. With
a piece of chat software, available for any kind of computer at
little or no cost, Internet users can plunge into thousands of
never-ending discussions of computers, politics, sports _ and yes,
sex, even sex. For more information, visit http://www.irchelp.org.
</P>
<P>
   My experiments with Linux software led me back to the universe
of chat. Desperate for help, I found an excellent IRC channel where
Linux users swap advice 24 hours a day. Those guys have bailed me
out on more than one occasion.
</P>
<P>
   But I've no idea who helped me, because IRC chatters are usually
anonymous. As a result, most IRC channels are filled with
trashtalk. While CompuServe and America Online chat rooms have at
least a few rules, IRC is like Chicago in the era of Al Capone.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional chat has a bad reputation among serious computer
users, but the technology is getting a second chance thanks to the
concept of ``instant messaging,'' a variation of chat which could
become an indispensable business tool.
</P>
<P>
   Instant messaging brings new precision and power to the concept
of chat, mainly because it introduces a concept called
``awareness'' _ the ability to know whether particular people are
actually connected to the network at that time.
</P>
<P>
   America Online made the first big move in instant messaging
three years ago. Its Buddy Lists would tell you if a friend was
connected to AOL at that moment, and let you pop him a message. But
the most dramatic success story comes from Tel Aviv. There a
company called Mirabilis Ltd. produced I, a system that allows any
Internet user on Earth to hunt up friends and colleagues for an
instant chat.
</P>
<P>
   A network of I &UR;  &LR; servers is scattered around the Internet, and
members like me download a small piece of free software that runs
on my computers. (You want it? Go to http://www.i.com.) Whenever I
log onto the Net, my I &UR;  &LR; software tells the server I'm available.
Other I &UR;  &LR; users can now message me, or I can block out everybody but
my friends and colleagues. You can set I &UR;  &LR; so that you're only
visible to people you want to hear from.
</P>
<P>
   Mirabilis hasn't advertised its product, instead counting on
word of mouth. That was enough. Over 25 million people worldwide
use I, 60 percent of them outside of the United States and Canada.
Last summer, AOL bought the company for $287 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a group of people who live their life on the Web, and
I &UR;  &LR; became their product,'' said Fred Singer, chief operating
officer of AOL's I &UR;  &LR; subsidiary. Most are hobbyists, but a growing
number use I &UR;  &LR; as a powerful business messaging tool. Imagine
knowing at a glance whether a client or colleague is at his desk.
Or being able to round up several co-workers at a moment's notice
for an impromptu chat session about an important project.
</P>
<P>
   Instant messaging is well past the hobby stage. I &UR;  &LR; now offers a
version designed for corporate networks. The company is also
looking at ways to let Internet retailers use I &UR;  &LR; to communicate
with customers. Millions of us get e-mail messages announcing
bargain airfares, but it may be hours before we see them. Send that
same message via I, and many customers will whip out their credit
cards on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   Lotus Development Corp. foresees a bright future for instant
messaging inside the corporation. On Monday, at the Lotusphere
conference in Orlando, Fla., Lotus showed off SameTime, which lets
anyone on a corporate network locate and chat with anyone else on
the network _ wherever he or she is. Lotus CEO Jeff Papows told me
he used SameTime to collaborate with colleagues on his keynote
speech while zipping southward at 30,000 feet in the corporate jet.
</P>
<P>
   Real-time communication about real work. It's enough to give
Internet chatting a good name.

   --The Red Sox have a spring training game against the Yankees in
Fort Myers, Fla., March 10. On that very same date, a few miles
south, it'll be opening night for ``No, No, Nanette'' at the Sugden
Community Theater in Naples . . . And people think we make this
stuff up.

<P>
   --Came back from Denver to a stack of unopened mail in the
office. My favorite missive, addressed to ``Don Shaughnessy,'' was
a ``personal'' form letter from John Harrington explaining my
``concerns about the presence of street vendor carts outside Fenway
Park.'' Yikes. The Sox obviously felt the hit on this one. It's
rare for media members to get this kind of response from old Jack
Harrington.

   --Another reason to like Bill Parcells: He doesn't cover for his
players. The Tuna cut to the chase after Sunday's loss in Denver.
Citing the key play of the game, he said, ``Victor Green fell
asleep.'' It was OK to say that because it was the truth and Green
is a professional athlete. Pete Carroll no doubt would have said,
``Some of our people didn't step up and didn't get it done.''

   --Colorado Senator Wayne Allard is writing an ``Impeachment

RIFT MAY SIGNAL CLUB'S LAST NOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIAN WALKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, so many years now, music lovers have made a home at
Wally's, the tiny club that is Boston's unofficial mecca for jazz.
But a different kind of blues is being sung there now, a song of
greed and betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   The lone survivor of Boston's Jazz Age of the 1940s, Wally's has
been a training ground for generations of future stars and a haven
for luminaries from Billie Holiday in 1948 to Marcus Roberts, who
shook the rafters in a performance I witnessed just a couple of
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   When Joseph ``Wally'' Walcott died last year at 101, he left a
daughter, three grandchildren, and _ alas _ an estate large enough
for even would-be heirs to covet.
</P>
<P>
   And covet it they do. Elynor Walcott and her three sons, Lloyd,
Frank, and Paul Poindexter, were named in Walcott's will as his
sole heirs. The estate, which includes the club, is worth about
$1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   But few things swell the ranks of one's relations like the
discovery of a sizable estate. So Walcott's long-estranged wife has
rushed in to demand a portion. Right behind her are the
grandchildren of a woman, now dead, who claimed that Wally was her
father.
</P>
<P>
   Battles like these over an estate are not uncommon. In this
case, though, the losers might include jazz lovers: If any of the
last-minute supplicants prevail, the tiny club might have to be
sold to satisfy their claims.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, Walcott married Madeline M. Walcott, from whom he
separated in 1988. While the couple never divorced, the Walcott
family maintains that Wally entered into an informal settlement of
$224,000 that included a house for her in Dorchester.
</P>
<P>
   The couple had relatively little contact for most of the decade
before Wally died. But Madeline Walcott filed a motion for suppport
in 1997, prompting a flurry of legal maneuvering that remained
unresolved when Walcott died in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Madeline Walcott also contends, in an affidavit, that Walcott
was not of sound mind when he signed the final version of his will
in 1993, a claim pending in Suffolk Probate Court.
</P>
<P>
   (Hold it right there. I knew Wally and interviewed him at length
in 1994, when he was 97 and fending off city complaints of
overcrowding at the bar. Not only did he appear very much on top of
things, he insisted that I join him in one of his rituals _ a small
early-afternoon glass of brandy. The brandy, he said, was the key
to his longevity.)
</P>
<P>
   There are other relatives who claim to have been disinherited:
the descendants of Laurice Penn.
</P>
<P>
   Penn's birth certificate in 1925 names someone other than
Walcott as her father, but that may not be the end of the matter.
She was listed as a relative in Wally's funeral program. Penn left
three children and six grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, a judge appointed a guardian to represent the
estate interests of Antoine Penn, Laurice Penn's minor grandson,
and allegedly Walcott's great-grandson.
</P>
<P>
   Walcott long maintained that he intended to leave his estate to
his daughter and grandsons, who have managed the club for years.
But his widow argues that she is entitled to a share of his estate.
</P>
<P>
   Madeline Walcott's claim will likely be complicated by the fact
that much of Walcott's property was held in trust. Walcott placed
all his real estate in a trust in 1973. The family argues that the
trust denies her any claim to the property.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, a spouse _ even a long-estranged, specifically
disinherited spouse _ has a strong claim to a portion of one's
estate. (The law was designed to prevent people from leaving their
spouses penniless.) If the bar is ruled to be part of Walcott's
estate, under the law Madeline Walcott would likely be entitled to
$25,000, plus one-third of the bar's future income. The question
will likely turn on technical questions about the nature of the
trust that held the property.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she wins, we'll probably have to sell Wally's,'' a glum
Frank Poindexter said Wednesday. ``My grandfather meant to leave
this club to my mother, my brothers and me.''
</P>
<P>
   The future of Wally's almost certainly rides on the outcome of
the probate battle. What a cold, bloodless finale that could be for
a place of such life and warmth.
</P>
<P>
   For now, everything appears the same _ the exposed brick, the
pictures of jazz legends lining the walls, the classic jukebox. But
that may be illusion. Joseph Walcott's legacy will be decided not
on a bandstand but in a courtroom, where there's no music to
accompany the blues.

CORPORATE AMERICA HOLDS OFF ON LOBBYING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The pollsters say only one in five Americans are
paying attention to the impeachment trial of President Clinton.
Lobbyists say they are not directly contacting senators. But to
hear senators tell it, there has rarely been an issue that has
drawn more public response.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican and potential swing
vote, recently received so many e-mail messages about the trial _
more than 80,000 _ that her computer system crashed.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Olympia J. Snowe, a fellow Maine Republican and also a
possible swing vote, reports receiving more letters, telephone
calls, and e-mail messages on the impeachment issue than on any
other during her tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Other senators report a similar crush of constituent input. Yet
this is not the kind of lobbying that occurs during debate on most
legislation. While the liberal People for the American Way and the
conservative Christian Coalition have gained publicity in recent
days for organizing campaigns against and for Clinton's conviction,
respectively, most of the usual business lobbying groups are
staying out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a matter for the Senate and the Congress,'' said Frank
Coleman, vice president of the US Chamber of Commerce. ``There is
no role here for (us). We are a business lobby and it is not a
business issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, many of the business lobbyists who normally occupy
``Gucci Gulch,'' as the lobbyists' favorite congressional hallways
are known, are nowhere to be seen regarding the trial. Lobbyists
said they realize it would be inappropriate to contact senators
directly about voting for or against conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be awful,'' said Ken Feltman, president of the
American League of Lobbyists. ``There are some things that just
don't pass any smell test.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Feltman said that does not mean the lobbying business
has come to a standstill. With a load of legislation being
introduced by both parties this month, lobbyists are busier than a
year ago, dealing with Senate staff and House members. ``The White
House and Congress both want to demonstrate they are able to do
something,'' Feltman said, and that leads to lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   As for the flood of calls, letters, and e-mails on the trial,
they seem to come from two groups. First, many home-state
constituents are independently contacting their senators and
expressing their views. Second, a handful of political activist
groups are coordinating campaigns to influence senators.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to gauge the impact of the national groups. Michael
Lux, the political director for People for the American Way, said
his group is conducting rallies across the country against
conviction, with ``several hundred'' people expected at some of the
events. Lux could not provide specifics about how many people have
contacted senators with the help of the group. Lux said the
organization's lobbyists have not lobbied any senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``For our paid lobbyists to formally lobby would probably be
neither effective or maybe even appropriate,'' Lux said. ``This is
between a senator's conscience and their constituents.'' Lux said
he believed most other lobbyists also are refraining from
contacting senators. ``Most traditional lobbyists don't want to
touch this,'' he said. ``It is just not in the realm of what they
usually do.''
</P>
<P>
   Lux, whose group frequently battles with the Christian
Coalition, said he has heard the coalition is threatening to help
raise opposition in upcoming elections to senators who oppose
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Tate, executive director of the coalition, said that
charge is untrue, noting that his organization does not endorse
candidates. But Tate said the coalition is urging members to send
petitions to senators urging that Clinton be convicted if he does
not resign voluntarily. Tate estimated that 300,000 petitions, many
of them filled out on the organization's web site, have been
forwarded to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But Tate, who said he and his aides have not personally lobbied
any senator, said no threats are being made against anyone who
votes against conviction. ``We have made no types of threats to
them,'' he said. ``Sometimes, we get a lot more blame than credit
that we deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, many Senate aides said their offices are counting
input only from home-state constituents, while ignoring that from
other states. Senate aides said that in recent years, they have
been flooded with ``blast faxes'' and e-mail ``spam lists,'' both
of which can send countless messages to senators with the push of a
computer button. That is apparently what happened to Collins, whose
e-mail system could not sustain the load of 80,000 messages, the
vast majority of which were from out of state.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the two years she has been a senator, there has been no
issue that has generated so much contact from constituents,'' said
Felicia Knight, a spokeswoman for Collins. But Knight said most
home-state voters ``respect the gravity of the decision. They say,
`we realize you have to make the decision to do what's right.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Snowe, who has received about 12,000 phone calls on impeachment
since last summer, has received a torrent in the month since the
House approved articles of impeachment on Dec. 19. A spokeswoman
said Snowe has received 1,472 calls from Maine residents who are
against conviction, and 1,767 calls for conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, has received
600 letters in the last five weeks, as well as about 500 e-mails a
day. They are split evenly for and against conviction. ``They are
very passionate, very emotional,'' Chafee spokesman Nicholas Graham
said. ``Very few say, `Keep an open mind.' Most of them are, `Throw
him out' or `Leave him alone.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy has been receiving 150 calls a day
recently, with 90 percent against conviction.

MILLS ADDS TONE OF DIVERSITY IN ARGUING THE CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Don't call back while Cheryl's on.
</P>
<P>
   That was the word from an excited White House worker Wednesday
as Cheryl D. Mills, a White House deputy counsel and
behind-the-scenes power, emerged from the shadows to defend
President Clinton, arguing strenuously that he should not be
convicted in a case that began with alleged civil rights violations
in the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit.
</P>
<P>
   It was, by any measure, an unusual moment. Mills, 33, is only
the third black to speak from the Senate floor _ former senators
Edward W. Brooke of Massachusetts and Carol Moseley-Braun of
Illinois were the others.
</P>
<P>
   But at the White House the nervous anticipation focused not on
the rarity Mills represented but on the authority Clinton aides
hoped she would bring to the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stand here before you today because President Bill Clinton
believed I could stand here for him,'' she told the senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about civil rights, because this president's
record on civil rights, on women's rights, on all of our rights, is
unimpeachable,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In a trial that so far has featured only white male lawyers
arguing before a Senate dominated by white men, Mills's appearance
was a jolt, so much that Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott stumbled
and called her ``Mr. Counsel'' before correcting himself and saying
``Ms. Counsel,'' when he introduced her.
</P>
<P>
   Mills, a Stanford Law School graduate and one of Clinton's
longest-serving lawyers, is a member of the impeachment trial's
defense team, a group that expanded Tuesday when former Senator
Dale Bumpers of Arkansas, a longtime Clinton friend, took a seat
with the other White House lawyers on the Senate floor. Bumpers did
not seek reelection last year.
</P>
<P>
   Bumpers, a lawyer and like Clinton, a former Arkansas governor,
is a gifted orator who enjoys friendly relations with both
Republican and Democratic senators. He is being tapped for his
institutional perspective and knowledge of the chamber's traditions
that could bolster Clinton's defense.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Holmes Norton, a lawyer and the nonvoting House delegate
for the District of Columbia, said, ``I'm not sure if a black
lawyer helps him before the Senate. I do know that a former member
helps him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a member of the club. She is not a member of the club, ''
Norton said.
</P>
<P>
   Mills was the third White House lawyer to argue on Clinton's
behalf, following on the heels of White House counsel Charles F. C.
Ruff and special counsel Gregory Craig. Craig focused on the first
article of impeachment, which alleges Clinton committed perjury
during his Aug. 17 grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Craig was foreign policy adviser from 1984 to 1988 for Senator
Edward M. Kennedy. In 1991, he prepped Kennedy for his testimony in
the Palm Beach, Fla., rape trial of the senator's nephew, William
Kennedy Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, David Kendall, Clinton's personal attorney and trusted
friend of Hillary Rodham Clinton, will discuss various aspects of
the obstruction of justice charge. Kendall has been Clinton's lead
lawyer on the Whitewater investigation. He saw his profile climb
during his cross-examination of Independent Counsel Kenneth W.
Starr last month during the House Judiciary Committee's impeachment
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Bumpers will summarize the case Thursday to end the White House
defense, rounding out three days of arguments that opened Tuesday
with an overview by Ruff, who called the charges against the
president ``a witches' brew'' of conjecture that did not warrant
the president's removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   Three other lawyers sitting at the defense table have not had
speaking roles. They are deputy White House counsel Bruce R.
Lindsey, the president's close confidant from Arkansas; Nicole K.
Seligman, Kendall's partner at the Williams &AMP; Connolly law firm;
and Lanny Breuer, a special White House counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Seligman, who attended Radcliffe College and Harvard Law School,
was a member of the defense team that represented Oliver L. North
in the Iran-Contra controversy. She also represented John F.
Kennedy Jr. and his sister, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, in their
efforts to stop the auctioning of their father's presidential
memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Mills' public debut of sorts Wednesday, on the sixth
anniversary of her appointment at the White House, that gave the
impeachment trial a different flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Mills's job before the Senate was to poke holes in the
Republican prosecutors' case by rebutting charges that Clinton
obstructed justice when his secretary, Betty Currie, retrieved
gifts from Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Mills argued that Currie had testified before the grand jury
that Clinton did not order her to get the gifts from Lewinsky.
Mills said it was an insult to Currie to suggest that her loyalty
to Clinton ``breeds dishonesty.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills opened her argument by saying, ``As a lawyer, as an
American, and as an African-American,'' the rule of law is a
strongly held principle of hers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is what many have struggled and died for, the right to be
equal before the law,'' she said, speaking deliberately, and using
the cadence of her voice for effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hate to take her on in a courtroom,'' said Minyon Moore,
the White House deputy political director who took a break from
working to watch Mills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's fair to say that the president has extraordinary
confidence in her,'' said White House spokesman Barry Toiv.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Mills is teasingly referred to as ``Dr.
No,'' for having a tendency during Clinton's reelection campaign in
1996 to veto certain expenditures to avoid possible ethics
violations.
</P>
<P>
   She joined Clinton's campaign in 1992, moving from the
Washington area to Little Rock, Ark., to serve as a deputy general
counsel during the Clinton-Gore campaign. She joined the White
House staff after the president's inauguration, rising from an
associate counsel to holding the dual title of deputy assistant and
deputy counsel to the president.
</P>
<P>
   A close associate of Mills at the White House, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said that Mills ``puts a face on the
president and his commitment to civil rights'' and that she offered
a potent counterpunch to Republican prosecutors who accused Clinton
last week of rolling back civil rights by his conduct in the Jones
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think about it, there is absolutely no way something
like this could have happened even 10 years ago . . . where an
African-American woman would be arguing on behalf of the president
really in any capacity, let alone in a capacity this momentous,''
Mills's colleague said.

BUILDING A MUSICAL DREAM WITH MP3 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a revolution going on, and Brett Fasullo and Ty Rauber
are true believers. That's not to say the two Boston men don't
resemble revolutionaries. With his tawny ponytail and pierced
eyebrow, Rauber is an intense, exceedingly mature 21-year-old
Boston University student. By night, Fasullo, 28, is a member of
the local band Flexie; by day, he sunlights (as opposed to
moonlights) as a computer consultant.
</P>
<P>
   These two believers embrace a technology called MP3, an
audio-compression format that enables anyone with a computer and a
little technical know-how to copy CDs into MP3 computer files and
post them on the Internet. They recently launched a site called
DMOD.com, where Web browsers can sample MP3 music files and buy
them for $1 a track. There's nothing particularly new about this
idea; MP3.com offers music for free, and goodnoise.com sells tracks
for 99 cents a pop. But the DMOD player, like other commercial
formats, encrypts its files, so you can't share the music with 200
of your closest friends.
</P>
<P>
   The impulse behind this local venture is the age-old hope: Some
day, one band is going to leap out of obscurity by distributing
music on-line. Now, musicians have been on-line since the early
days of the Web, but to date, there hasn't been a single band that
catapulted to fame via the Internet. ``That's the dream,'' Fasullo
admits.
</P>
<P>
   The answer to that dream just might be MP3. College students
certainly adore the technology; visit any dormitory that has
high-speed Internet access and you're just as likely to hear music
blaring out of a computer as out of a stereo.
</P>
<P>
   Others are less than thrilled about the technology. Take a quick
guess who those folks might be? Did I hear you say recording
industry executives? Two points.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the Recording Industry Association of America and
five major record companies announced plans to develop a standard
for digital distribution that would prevent illegal copying. The
RIAA routinely shuts down sites that offer free MP3 recordings by
major artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's piracy,'' says Cary Sherman, senior executive vice
president and general counsel for the RIAA. ``When you had piracy
on the high seas, you didn't have commerce because no one would put
their goods on ships when they knew they would be plundered.''
</P>
<P>
   But the $12 billion recording industry isn't exactly trembling
in the face of collegiate Captain Hooks; even Sherman admits that
the big issue here is the realignment of the music business. How do
you sell and distribute music digitally and insure that the profits
go back to the label and the artist? Hollywood types had the same
type of fears when VCRs first became popular in the '80s; they took
a lawsuit to the Supreme Court to prevent VCR copying for home use.
Guess what? They lost, and the film industry is doing just fine.
</P>
<P>
   The move to digital distribution is undoubtedly going to happen:
It's just a question of when. ``We take it as a given that at some
point down the road, we're going to be irrelevant,'' says Mike
Dreese, co-founder of Newbury Comics, a Boston-based music store
chain. ``You will see a steady erosion in retail record sales.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the industry sorts out the issues, the question remains
what it will mean for independent artists. Established names like
the Beastie Boys and Public Enemy have defied their own record
labels and posted MP3 files on their Web sites. But what of the
little guys, the folks who could truly benefit from global
exposure?
</P>
<P>
   A time-honored truism applies. No technology can replace the
essence of art, that little human thing called talent. You can
market bad music in any format, and it still won't sell.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the legal MP3 music available on-line isn't all that
good. There are some exceptions. Frank Black, former leader of
alt-rock sensation The Pixies, is selling his terrific new album on
goodnoise.com. But most of the stuff available on MP3.com is
garage-quality for quirky niche markets (like one band called
Celtic Elvis, which is neither.)
</P>
<P>
   ``For every 1,000 bands, only one is going to become a star,''
says Bob Cohn, Goodnoise chairman. ``We haven't found that band
yet, but we predict it will happen.'' Goodnoise, launched last
year, reported $12,400 in earnings for its first quarter. But Cohn
predicts profits will arrive some day, too.
</P>
<P>
   The local believers are equally optimistic. ``Keep your fingers
crossed,'' says Fasullo, an avid snowboarder. ``If it happens,
that's more snowboarding for all of us.''

WILL BUSH RUN? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS 
c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas Governor George W. Bush loves his life. He loves his wife
and daughters. He loves his family and friends. He loves his job.
He loves his home. He loves Texas, a state that is a nation unto
itself. When he wakes up in the morning, he can hardly wait to get
to work.
</P>
<P>
   Texans like him back. Bush's job approval ratings are
stratospheric. His personal popularity is immense. Rita Braver,
down in Austin to profile the governor for the CBS News program
``Sunday Morning,'' said she couldn't find anyone in Texas willing
to say anything negative about the governor.
</P>
<P>
   (``She didn't talk to me,'' said one of Bush's brothers
mischievously).
</P>
<P>
   When he was sworn in on Tuesday, Bush became the first governor
in the state's history to begin serving a second four-year term. He
was reelected with an astonishing 69 percent of the vote, winning
half the Hispanic vote and a quarter of the African-American vote.
His coattails enabled a Republican sweep of every statewide office
and every statewide judicial post. In four short years, Bush all
but completed the transformation of Texas politics, cementing GOP
gains in what was once the land of the yellow dog Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no one cares about any of that. The question that
dominated Bush's second inaugural was whether or not he would seek
the Republican presidential nomination in the year 2000. The answer
to all that asked was: ``Assume it's a go, unless he says
otherwise.'' And so they did. Fund-raising people met to discuss
the money. Political people met to talk about the politics. A rough
timetable was outlined; the establishment of a presidential
campaign exploratory committee in late March, an announcement of
candidacy in June or July. The briefings on issues of national
security, economic policy, and cultural concerns will continue
apace. By the end of the Texas Legislative session, all systems
will be ready for launch.
</P>
<P>
   On some level, Bush has to run for president. It will never be
this easy (relatively speaking) again.
</P>
<P>
   The political infrastructure is there. Bush enjoys political
support within the GOP that is both wide and deep. The Bush
network, built by his father and expanded by the sons, is composed
of 30,000 to 40,000 people across the country. Most of them would
suit up for the campaign the moment they were asked to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The money is there. Bush has on his hard drive the names of
19,000 people who contributed $1,000 or more to his reelection
campaign. Most of them would write a check for $1,000 to jump-start
his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's fund-raising team believes that they can raise more than
$40 million in 1999 alone.
</P>
<P>
   The brains are there. Bush has spent countless hours consulting
with conservative intellectuals, economists, and veterans of his
father's administration. Former Secretary of State George Shultz,
Stanford University's chancellor, Condi Rice, UCLA sociologist
James Q. Wilson, Harvard University professor Michael Porter, and a
host of others are all on board to help think through pressing
policy matters.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, the opportunity is there. The year 2000
presidential race is an ``open seat'' election. There will be no
elected incumbent in the field.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP field is solid, but not strong. It's a lot easier to win
the general election if the intraparty opposition can be quickly
dispatched.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the front-loaded primary calendar, Bush has the
political and financial resources to lock up the GOP presidential
nomination by the end of March 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like a cork on a raging river,'' Bush said last August
when asked how he felt about a possible presidential candidacy. The
currents are now hurtling him toward the race. Demand for his
candidacy escalates with each passing day. He must decide soon or
risk alienating the Republican base.
</P>
<P>
   Many are certain he will run. I would not be surprised if he
went the other way. George W. Bush has what it takes to run for
president, but he knows what it takes from the candidate and those
he loves the most.
</P>
<P>
   In his book about the 1988 presidential campaign, Richard Ben
Cramer wrote: ``What it takes is your life.'' Is it worth it?
Washington has become a cesspool. National politics have become
deranged. Electronic media have no interest in governance or
matters of public policy; the name of the ratings game is scandal
and character assassination. This state of affairs will probably
get worse before it gets better.
</P>
<P>
   Bush may well wait until the maelstrom subsides and make his run
four years down the road. The question that no one can answer is
whether, by then, his time will have passed.
</P>

ROBME.COM: THE NEXT HOT STOCK? 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ All you need is a dot com in your name, and
you'll make a big stock market gain. That's the myth, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't really the way it works.
</P>
<P>
   Business news provider Marketwatch.com recently went public, and
in one day its shares increased in value 474 percent, making its
founder, Larry Kramer, the most celebrated business success of the
new year.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer has been working hard for years creating and managing
sports and news on-line services. He didn't simply find a niche,
think up a cool name and stick ``.com'' at the end.
</P>
<P>
   All kinds of Internet companies are about to jump into the stock
market, companies with names like Priceline.com and Pcorder.com and
Miningco.com providing news, entertainment, information and, maybe
what everybody hopes for, stratospheric stock values.
</P>
<P>
   If you read newspaper reports or books on how to get rich with
an Internet business, you might think all you need is a Web site
and a press release saying you'll be the first to sell extra virgin
snake oil on-line.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that you haven't found an extra virgin snake yet.
Because of crazed investors with laptops, your stock can be worth
more than GM's before you make a dime.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, I'm running in the red, so why can't I get rich just like
Amazon.com?
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, all I have going for me are Internet
business-advice books with titles like ``New Rules for the New
Economy,'' ``Rules for Revolutionaries'' and ``If Only We Knew What
We Know.''
</P>
<P>
   I worry more about what I don't know, but that's too much to put
in a 200-page book about the ``knowledge economy.''
</P>
<P>
   My knowledge economy is running a deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings up my company, Robme.com, which I hope to take
public, as soon as I figure out what IPO stands for, and what the
company is going to sell _ besides stock.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Kramer, the former executive editor of the San Francisco
Examiner, I'm damned if I'm going to work hard at this. I've seen
how hard he's sweated for seven years. No thanks.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Kawasaki's ``Rules for Revolutionaries'' has the motto:
``Create like a god. Command like a king. Work like a slave.''
</P>
<P>
   I figure that two out of three isn't bad.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, I spent a lot of time picking a name for my company,
something to go with the ``.com.''
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``New Rules for the New Economy,'' Wired magazine
editor Kevin Kelly says, ``The only factor becoming scarce in a
world of abundance is human attention.''
</P>
<P>
   An Internet company has to have a name that catches people's
attention, ``Yahoo'' for example. It took me a while to come up
with ``Robme.com.''
</P>
<P>
   I checked the InterNIC database, which keeps track of all the
registered .coms in the United States, and found that most of the
names I wanted were taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Con.com'' seemed like a good name, since I planned to make
money by selling electrons. Some kind of convention organization
had registered it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rob.com'' also seemed good, because it represents both me and
what I plan to do. Alas, it was taken by a guy in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robme.com'' was still available. I settled on it, not just
because it contained my name, but because it fit some advice in
Kelly's book.
</P>
<P>
   One of his rules for the new economy is ``Follow the Free,''
something I've done, starting with happy hours, through a career in
journalism and perhaps next into soup kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   But Kelly means the rule in another sense. He writes: ``Because
prices move inexorably toward the free, the best move in the
network economy is to anticipate this cheapness.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, give away a better mouse pad and the world will
click a path to your stock.
</P>
<P>
   By Kelly's way of thinking, Abbie Hoffman was ahead of his time
with his book titled ``Steal This Book.'' If only the Internet had
existed then, Hoffman could have made millions from his books'
losses, just like Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Losing money seems to be the secret for Internet companies, and
it's something I know how to do very well.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I had to weigh Kelly's advice against that of former
Apple ``evangelist'' Kawasaki. In his ``Rules for
Revolutionaries,'' he says it's a ``death magnet'' to lower prices
to try to capture greater market share.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't really matter what I was going to sell my product for
anyway, because I didn't have a product.
</P>
<P>
   However, one of Kelly's sub rules is: ``Releasing incomplete
`buggy' products is not cost-cutting desperation; it is the
shrewdest way to complete a product when your customer is smarter
than you are.''
</P>
<P>
   There you have it. I have as incomplete and buggy a product as
you can possibly have _ nothing. Whatever the product turns out to
be, my Internet customers are bound to be smarter.
</P>
<P>
   I'm perfectly positioned to make a killing with my Internet
start-up.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, I know from my former editor's experience, the
rules of the new economy may not be so different from the rules of
the old economy.
</P>
<P>
   Work like a slave, and if you create like a god or rule like a
king, don't advertise it.
</P>
<P>
   Funny that the guys who write books on how to succeed on the
Internet always publish their books on paper, and go on the lecture
circuit in person.
</P>
<P>
   And they don't give the advice away for free.
</P>

WILDFIRE: STILL NOT READY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My wife hates my new secretary. The intruder's name is Wildfire,
and for the past month she has been answering my telephone, taking
messages when I am not around, and helping me to return my
telephone calls. Wildfire is friendly, smart and sexy _ bonus
points with some of my associates, but not with my wife. Another
thing my wife hates is Wildfire's chatty, non-professional demeanor
and the fact that Wildfire often misinterprets what my wife says.
What makes it all the worse is the fact that Wildfire isn t a
person at all: she's a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Wildfire is a digital personal assistant, an artificial
intelligence-based voice-mail system created by Wildfire
Communications of Lexington, Mass. I wrote an article last October
about my experiences calling into voice-recognition systems like
Wildfire and a Portico, a similar service created by General Magic.
A lot of readers wrote me that week, saying that I hadn t given
these digital assistants a fair shake. A typical letters was sent
to me by Stewart Duggan: You don t just dislike digital or virtual
assistants such as Portico or Wildfire, you simply don t like
waiting, he wrote. It would seem that for you to be satisfied, the
business world would need to move to or adopt all direct-dial phone
numbers and eliminate all secretaries, receptionists, and virtual
assistants. Thus the reason your article was myopic, at best.
</P>
<P>
   A slightly kinder e-mail came from Wildfire Communications
itself. They offered to let me try Wildfire for a month so that I
could write about my experience with the service from the other
side. I took them up on the offer, and a few weeks later a Pacific
Bell GSM wireless phone showed up at my front door. Pacific Bell
has integrated Wildfire with its cell phone system, and thanks to
the miracle of nation-wide roaming, I m able to use that GSM phone
in Boston by roaming on the Omnipoint wireless network.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a traditional voice mail system, the GSM phone has
Wildfire. So I call-forwarded my home phone to the mobile, and for
the last month it's been my primary phone.
</P>
<P>
   The way it is set up with Pacific Bell, Wildfire is a lot like a
super voice-mail system. If somebody calls me and I pick up my
phone, I get to immediately speak with the caller. But if I don t
pick up, or if I m busy, Wildfire comes on the line. The computer
asks the caller for his or her name, then says that I m not
available and asks to take a message. Wildfire will also learn the
caller's phone number, either from Caller-ID or by having the
caller tap it in on the touch-tone keypad. After the same person
calls more than a few times, Wildfire will learn the caller's name
and store it in the voice recognition database, so that the caller
can get through faster.
</P>
<P>
   When I call to get my messages, I first have to type my access
code. Oh, Hi! says Wildfire. The computer then lets me browse
through my voice mail.
</P>
<P>
   For each message Wildfire plays back the caller's recorded. I
can then command the computer with short, easy-to-remember phrases
like what does it say? to hear it; describe it, to learn when the
message came in; next one, to go to the next message, or throw it
away.
</P>
<P>
   I can even say call this one, which causes Wildfire to call the
person at the number they left behind; during the call I can say
Wildfire! to bring the system back into the conversation, in case I
want to look up somebody else's phone number or conference a third
party into the call.
</P>
<P>
   One of the real powers of the cell-phone integration is the
ability to use Wildfire to place calls, like this one:
</P>
<P>
   Me: Call
</P>
<P>
   Wildfire: Call who?
</P>
<P>
   Say the name of one of your contacts, or say phone number.
</P>
<P>
   Me: Dan Greenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Wildfire: Dan Greenberg. Is that correct? Yes or No?
</P>
<P>
   Me: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Wildfire: At work, home, mobile, pager, or other?
</P>
<P>
   Me: Work.
</P>
<P>
   Wildfire: Dialing. Press 88 or say Wildfire if you need me.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that's the way it's supposed to work. Unfortunately,
Wildfire frequently misunderstands my command, especially if I m
someplace with a lot of background noise. Recently, at a computer
conference, my dialog with Wildfire went something like this:
</P>
<P>
   Me: Next message.
</P>
<P>
   Wildfire: Call whom?
</P>
<P>
   Me: Next message.
</P>
<P>
   Wildfire: Call whom?
</P>
<P>
   Me: Next message.
</P>
<P>
   Wildfire: I m sorry, did you say other?
</P>
<P>
   Me: No. Next message.
</P>
<P>
   Wildfire: I m sorry. I did not understand you.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem with Wildfire is that you can't interrupt the
computer when it is talking or when Wildfire is playing a message,
something that is called barge in in the technical world of
computer telephony.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, Wildfire does has a way for dealing with both noisy
environments and for barging in when the system is talking: you can
control Wildfire by pressing the buttons on your phone's keypad.
Indeed, using the keypad is significantly faster than using the
voice-recognition prompts. To me, this indicates that the voice
system could be a lot better than it is.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot more to both Wildfire and Portico than I was able
to experience through Pacific Bell's offering. For example,
Wildfire Communications has developed a system that lets Wildfire
users hear their messages and program in contacts over the Internet
using a web browser.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Pacific Bell doesn t make this feature available
because of security concerns. Portico, meanwhile, lets you send
voice messages to people over the Internet as e-mail attachments.
This is a neat gimmick, although in practice it doesn t seem all
that useful.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that I like about Wildfire is the way that the system
will automatically build an address book from frequently contacts.
</P>
<P>
   Voice-activated address books also make it a lot easier to dial
when driving. Unfortunately, the way that Pacific Bell has the
system set up means that I have to dial Wildfire first, then place
my other calls. I would much rather have Wildfire always listening,
always ready for my commands.
</P>
<P>
   My wife has a different take, of course. She objects to having
Wildfire take her messages, and she hates it when Wildfire is
listening in on my calls to her. The program needs to learn that
not everybody is a business contact, Beth says.

SEARCH IS ON FOR SOURCE OF SALMON VIRUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN AND ALICE GIORDANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It began with a few dead salmon floating inside a hatchery in
North Attleboro, Mass., killed by strange tumors that took hold on
the ``swim bladders'' fish use for balance and grew until the
bladders burst.
</P>
<P>
   Now, biologists are struggling to understand _ and contain _ a
rare viral outbreak before it threatens the region's battered wild
salmon population, which conservationists are trying to restore.
Since the virus was confirmed last month, officials have
quarantined a second hatchery in Maine, killed hundreds of exposed
fish, and sent others to a federal lab in West Virginia for further
study of the mysterious illness.
</P>
<P>
   But that may not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   Conservationists are now faced with the frustrating possibility
that they will have to kill some of the endangered wild salmon when
the fish return next spring to spawn in Maine's Pleasant River. All
the diseased hatchery fish had come from the eastern Maine stream,
suggesting the outbreak began there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something we want to do, but if salmon returning next
year test positive (for the virus), we may have to reclaim the
river and start all over again,'' said Ed Baum, senior biologist
for the Atlantic Salmon Authority, which oversees efforts to
rebuild the state's salmon populations.
</P>
<P>
   The outbreak of swim bladder sarcoma virus _ reported only twice
before in salmon populations _ is a cruel turn for a species that
has already had more than its share of misfortune. When the
European settlers first arrived, salmon spawned by the million in
rivers from eastern Maine to Connecticut. Dams and pollution have
since reduced New England's population to fewer than 2,000, mostly
spawning in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Some suspect that the outbreak became almost inevitable as
commercial salmon farms sprung up along the Maine coast. Every
year, tens of thousands of fish escape from their holding pens,
allowing them, scientists speculate, to spread diseases to which
the wild native population has no immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators are particularly concerned about the import
of salmon sperm from Norway and Scotland to create hybrid fish
here, noting that the swimbladder virus was first reported in
Scotland in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Escaped imported salmon can also breed with native salmon,
causing long-term genetic damage, according to Ray Owen, U.S.
Commissioner for the North Atlantic Salmon Confederation and
Association, which oversees international salmon agreements.
</P>
<P>
   But aquaculture companies stress that their fish appear to be
virus-free. ``We're very concerned about disease, that's the reason
we have such strict health standards,'' said Joseph MaGonigle of
the Maine Aquaculture Association which represewnts commercial
salmon growers. ``Every single fish is vaccinated before they're
even put in the water at a commercial hatchery.'' Indeed,
biologists know so little about the virus that they can shed little
light on its origins, or how far it may have spread.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our scientific literature resources are extremely limited,''
said Paul R. Bowser, a specialist in fish pathology at Cornell
University who helped identify the virus at the federal fish
hatchery in North Attleboro.
</P>
<P>
   What they do know is that the virus is deadly, causing cancerous
tumors up to eight inches long inside the fish's abdomen, pressing
on the swimbladder and eventually killing the fish.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, another possible source of the trouble is human
efforts to help the wild salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Pleasant River is a spawning ground for only a
handful of salmon _ just 25 to 50 return each spring _ the US Fish
and Wildlife Service had tried to improve the odds of recovery by
taking some fish from the Pleasant River to hatcheries in
Massachusetts and Maine where they could reproduce in relative
safety.
</P>
<P>
   But salmon kept in close quarters are more vulnerable to disease
_ just like people in a city _ and, by 1996, officials at the North
Attleboro hatchery had begun to see salmon mysteriously die. By
1998, the deaths had become so frequent that they isolated the
building where the Pleasant River salmon were kept and called in
biologists from Cornell in Ithaca, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The virus ultimately killed 80 of the 280 Pleasant River salmon
in North Attleboro, and 160 more were destroyed as a precaution.
The remaining 40, all infected with the virus, were spared so that
federal researchers could watch the disease progress at a West
Virginia lab.
</P>
<P>
   As the investigation widened, biologists found more infected
Pleasant River salmon at the Down East Salmon Federation hatchery
in Columbia Falls, Maine, and the Connors Brothers commercial
hatchery in Deblois, Maine. In both locations, the fish were
destroyed, and the Columbia Falls facility quarantined.
</P>
<P>
   Bowser believes the outbreak is limited to the Pleasant River
salmon, noting that hatcheries have seen no swimbladder virus when
they rear wild fish from other rivers. But, he admits, so little is
known that he can give no guarantees that the infection hasn't
spread.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like something out of space fell into the Pleasant
River,`` said Baum.

PLAN FOR STRICTER LICENSING STRIKES NERVE AMONG NURSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts nurses, already on edge about perceived
pressures to care for more patients with less support from their
cost-fixated employers, are up in arms about a proposal to stiffen
the rules on what a nurse must do to stay out of licensure trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The draft regulations would prohibit any nurse's conduct that
``may reflect adversely on the profession,'' which makes some
wonder if that could encompass engaging in union activity or
criticizing their working conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, as currently written, would also bar nurses from
providing more nursing care than the patient needs. That provision
strikes many as serving the interests of hospitals, nursing homes,
or home-care agencies trying to stint on patient care to cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Registration in Nursing's proposal would probably
generate controversy in any season, but it comes at a time when
nurses across the nation are already upset about the board's
decision this month to launch disciplinary actions against 18
nurses linked to cancer chemotherapy overdoses more than four years
ago at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The board's action in the Dana-Farber case and its proposed
disciplinary rules place the agency in the middle of a growing
national debate about nurses' personal accountability for problems
within the troubled health care system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a difficult time to practice nursing right now,'' said
Karen Daley, president of the Massachusetts Nurses Association.
``If the nursing board perpetuates this kind of inappropriate use
of their discretionary power, they will send nurses out of the
profession.''
</P>
<P>
   Daley pointed out that the Nurses Association, a collective
bargaining agent, is joined in its opposition to many of the
board's proposed new rules by other nursing groups, including one
that represents nurse-managers _ an unusual alliance.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with about 100 nurses Tuesday night in Worcester,
board officials said the draft proposals are intended to codify
what the board has been doing for years under a vague two-page set
of regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that what is being proposed is more confusing or
broad is a false issue,'' the board's executive secretary, Theresa
Bonanno, told the nurses.
</P>
<P>
   Bonanno and other board officials said they could not respond to
specific complaints or counter what they called ``misconceptions''
until the draft regulations have been approved by other state
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Among nursing groups' other objections to the draft regulations
are a provision to allow summary suspension of a nurse's license to
protect public safety and new proscriptions against patient
``abandonment'' or ``leaving a nursing assignment'' without lining
up other care.
</P>
<P>
   The latter provisions, critics said, could force nurses into
``mandatory overtime'' if a hospital, nursing home, or home-care
agency doesn't provide adequate staffing.
</P>
<P>
   Many nurses see the board's recent actions as a sign of new
aggressiveness on the part of the agency that controls their
livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bonanno and the nursing board's chairwoman, Marie
McCarthy, say the timing of the Dana-Farber decision and the
disciplinary revisions is totally coincidental and represents no
new get-tough attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Intentional or not, the board's decisions have embroiled it in a
debate about how licensure agencies should respond to lapses in
quality of care that some see as the failings of individual
professionals, others as ``system'' failures, and still others as
combinations of the two.
</P>
<P>
   In most nurses' view _ shared by a growing number of health care
analysts _ it was ``the system'' at Dana-Farber that was to blame
for the notorious 1994 overdoses, not the nurses who failed to
catch the medication errors.
</P>
<P>
   According to the hospital's own admission and outside
investigators, the system failures at Dana-Farber, since largely
corrected, included the lack of a policy to require nurses to
double-check medication orders, the absence of computer systems to
flag overdoses, and insufficient staff training on new chemotherapy
regimens.
</P>
<P>
   The focus on ``systems'' problems is a growing trend in a
movement to cut down on medical errors _ a campaign launched, its
leaders say, in reaction to the Dana-Farber overdoses, which killed
Boston Globe health columnist Betsy A. Lehman and seriously injured
a North Andover schoolteacher, Maureen Bateman.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts pharmacy board reprimanded three pharmacists
at Dana-Farber who filled the mistaken chemotherapy order. In
November, the state medical licensure board retroactively suspended
the license of the doctor who wrote the erroneous order.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of those actions caused any outcry, unlike the nursing
board's decision to cite 18 Dana-Farber nurses for various acts of
alleged negligence. Two of the 16 have signed consent agreements in
which they do not contest the board's charges and promise to
undergo retraining.
</P>
<P>
   Support for the nurses among colleagues, professional groups,
and members of the public may rest partly on a general sympathy for
nurses. Many critics also complain about the lag between the
overdose episode and the board's action _ attributed by board
officials to the complexity of the investigation and the number of
nurses involved in the two patients' care.
</P>
<P>
   But the most forceful criticism rests on the emerging argument
that punishing health professionals who make mistakes will only
drive the problem deeper underground.
</P>
<P>
   The punish-the-perpetrators philosophy is ``akin to saying `What
we really need here is a bigger hammer,' '' said Michael Cohen,
director of a Pennsylvania-based Institute for Safe Medication
Practices. ``A punitive focus on individuals involved in medical
error is dangerous. It inhibits open discussion about errors,
creates a defensive and reactive environment, and hinders careful
and unbiased consideration of the system-based root causes of
errors.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Noble, a Boston physician who is vice chairman of the
powerful Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare
Organizations, called the nursing board's decision to punish
Dana-Farber nurses ``terribly upsetting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, in the Dana-Farber situation, there were lots
of things that made it very difficult for those nurses to know
quite what to do,'' Noble said. ``Therefore, we need to build
systems in which it's relatively easy for people to do the right
thing and have no qualms about being accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   However, this ``system'' emphasis runs counter in many ways to
the traditional emphasis on individual accountability by licensing
boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is `a system'?'' said McCarthy, the nursing board
chairwoman. ``A system is an inanimate thing and you can't blame an
inanimate thing. I believe a system is created and perpetuated by
people.''
</P>
<P>
   In the board's formal charges and in interviews, nursing board
officials make clear that they think the Dana-Farber nurses were
bound by professional standards to double-check the chemotherapy
doses, even if the hospital's policy did not require them to.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an either-or debate,'' said Patricia Benner, a
professor of nursing at the University of California at San
Francisco. ``Most nurse-practice acts say nurses should
double-check and verify that the physician's orders are correct.
You can't take out the personal responsibility element, because the
nurse is the patient's last defense against error. But we don't
need a punitive system that drives errors underground.''

<P>
   The NBA lockout is over. Finally. After nearly seven months. Ron
Mercer had joked that the delay between the unofficial end of the
lockout and training camp should be called ``Lockout II.'' Not
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball can now breathe freely on basketball courts after
spending months in boardrooms, suffocated by talks of proposals and
counterproposals. But before Rick Pitino can give his dusty whistle
a good workout, he has one more contractual issue to solve, albeit
painless.
</P>
<P>
   At some time Thursday Pitino, the team's coach and president,
was to sit down with Walker and sign the 6-foot-9-inch forward to a
six-year contract extension worth nearly $71 million.
</P>
<P>
   When contacted Wednesday, Pitino would not comment on the
specifics of the agreement he reportedly has with Walker. But he
did say that Walker ``will never have to worry about money again in
his life.'' The coach, who has known the 22-year-old Walker for six
years, also didn't mind speculating on the kind of player he can
become in the next six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's 6-10, 6-9 1/2, and he has guard skills,'' Pitino said.
``I also think that if he works on his body, he can absolutely
punish people inside. That's something we'll be looking for him to
do, to work on his body. He has the type of body that can hold 255
pounds of muscle.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Walker finishes the last year on his current
contract and the six years of his upcoming extension _ which
averages nearly $12 million per season _ he will be a month away
from his 29th birthday. So if he were to choose to play until age
35 (and to stay with the Celtics the entire time), he would become
Boston's all-time leader in seasons played. But that is news for
the next century. For this one, Pitino has a detailed plan for his
captain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year he shot 42 percent. This year we'd like to see that
percentage up to 47 or 48,'' the coach said. ``We'd also like to
see him make about 74 percent of his free throws (he made 64
percent last season). So those are the goals right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker has already established himself as a scorer/rebounder,
averaging 20 points and nearly 10 boards per game in his two-season
career. He also has not missed a game.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino knows that Walker will be on the Brandeis practice court
in Waltham, scrimmaging with his teammates. But the coach doesn't
know who all those teammates would be. He knows Popeye Jones will
be there. He knows Travis Knight, traded to the Lakers for Battie,
will not be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited to be a Laker,'' Knight said Wednesday from Los
Angeles. The 7-footer will began training camp Thursday _ in Santa
Barbara, Calif. Pitino knows Battie, the fifth pick in the 1997
draft, will be in Waltham. He still is not sure about Michael
Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart and his agent, Bill Duffy, were here Wednesday meeting
with the Celtics. The 6-10 free agent center toured the team's new
training facility and talked with Pitino and general manager Chris
Wallace. ``We're in a college-type recruiting situation right
now,'' Pitino said. Very simply, here's what that means for the
Celtics: If Stewart wasn't practicing with the team by Thursday at
2, that's not good. They want Stewart to give them an answer before
practice.
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto Raptors are also interested in acquiring the
shot-blocking Stewart. They hope the presence of Todd Bozeman helps
their cause. Bozeman is a Raptors scout who used to be Stewart's
coach at the University of California. Since the Raptors and
Celtics will play two exhibition games this month, there is a good
chance you will see Stewart on the court with many Celtics. No one
is sure whether he'll be there blocking their shots or trying to
swat away the attempts of the Raptors.
</P>
<P>
   This much is known: Stewart will not be returning to Sacramento.
The Kings have enough money to sign him but are choosing not to.
Instead, they are said to be pursuing free agent center Vlade
Divac.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wears Celtic green-and-white this week should prepare
for an anxious Pitino. He watched a ragged shirts-and-skins game
Wednesday and didn't say a word. And that's not because he didn't
want to. Since the league was still in a lockout situation, coaches
could not instruct players. That's not the case anymore. Basketball
is official again. The Celtics probably won't need watches, clocks,
and sundials to let them know the time. When they finally a hear
their coach's voice and whistle, they'll know it's time to play.

SOCIAL SECURITY PLAN ATTACKED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The booming stock market has helped millions of
Americans buy everything from new homes to college educations. Now,
President Clinton is proposing that the government try a similar
strategy, buying stocks in an attempt to earn money that it would
use to pay Social Security benefits.
</P>
<P>
   It's a better idea than the alternatives _ cutting benefits or
raising taxes _ to fix the financially troubled retirement program,
Clinton said in his State of the Union address Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   But economists and Republican lawmakers have attacked the
proposal. Their argument received a major boost when Alan
Greenspan, the highly respected chairman of the Federal Reserve,
told a House committee Wednesday that Clinton's plan could become a
drag on the US economy.
</P>
<P>
   While the details are sketchy, the White House has said that
Clinton's plan would put between $650 billion and $700 billion of
future budget surpluses into stocks over the next 15 years. At its
peak, the Social Security system would own 4 percent of the US
stock market.
</P>
<P>
   At $650 billion over 15 years, the government would invest an
average of $3.6 billion each month in stocks. By comparison,
investors put $14 billion a month into stock mutual funds last year
_ a figure that does not include investments in individual stocks.
</P>
<P>
   William Shipman of State Street Global Advisors, a Boston money
management, said the daily cash flows from Social Security, if
directed entirely into stocks on the New York Stock Exchange, would
come to far less than what the exchange handles in trades every
seven minutes. ``You can do the numbers a thousand ways but,
relative to the size of our markets, the government is basically
talking about peanuts,'' said Shipman, whose firm is a leading
proponent of giving the stock market a role in the retirement
system.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the idea of government stock-picking has quickly
provoked two sets of protests, one political and one economic.
</P>
<P>
   Raising a political objection, conservative Republicans
Wednesday attacked Clinton's idea because it blocks their own plans
for Social Security reform. Workers now pay 6.4 percent of their
wages to the government to fund the retirement program, and
employers pay another 6.4 percent. Many Republicans say workers
should divert a portion of that tax money to their own stock
accounts to save for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan embraces the idea of using stocks to shore up
Social Security, but it leaves the government, rather than
individual workers, to pick the investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want the federal government investing,'' said Senator
Don Nickles, a Republican from Oklahoma. ``I want individuals to
have some control over their own accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some lawmakers and business lobbies fear that the
government, once it owned a piece of a company, might be tempted to
dictate corporate policy. ``The possibilities for abuse in that
arrangement are unlimited,'' said House Majority Leader Dick Armey,
a Texas Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has already made it plain that it wants
some companies to change their practices. It is suing Microsoft
Corp., for example, to end its allegedly anti-competitive behavior,
and it is preparing to sue tobacco companies for the alleged harm
from smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of our members is opposed to the government getting
into the stock market,'' said Leanne Abdnor of the Alliance for
Worker Retirement Security, which includes the US Chamber of
Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, the National
Retail Federation, and the National Restaurant Association, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   The White House counters that it will work with Congress to find
a way to insulate its stock choices from political considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Trustees of the Social Security system, for example, could set
up an advisory board, which in turn would hire firms to invest the
money. The board could instruct the money managers to model their
investments on an index fund, buying the entire Standard and Poor's
500, for example. That would reduce the choice they have among
investments and eliminate the room for political interference,
White House aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, economists ranging from Henry Aaron of the Brookings
Institution to Alicia Munnell of Boston College support the
president's idea. They say it allows all workers to try to gain
from the stock market without leaving the benefit payments to any
individual worker subject to his or her own stock-picking skills.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, they say, Clinton would use the power of the market
without incurring the administrative fees that money-managers would
charge to open millions of individual stock accounts. Those fees,
they say, could whittle away much of the money that people earn on
their retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenspan, for one, is skeptical of Clinton's plan. ``I do
not believe that it is politically feasible to insulate such huge
funds from government direction,'' he told the House Ways and Means
Committee Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The result could be a drag on the economy, Greenspan said.
Traditionally, investors seek high profits, which guides them to
the most efficient companies. But the government, influenced by
political pressures, might put its money in inefficient companies.
</P>
<P>
   That would ``lower the capital efficiency of this country,''
Greenspan said. ``We will lower the thrust of productivity growth
and standards of living.''
</P>
<P>
   It might seem that government investing would put new cash in
the hands of businesses, which they could use for growth and
improvements. But some economists said that was not the case. The
reason: Every dollar invested is a dollar that is not being used to
pay down the federal debt.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, said Ron Gebhardtsbauer of the American Academy of
Actuaries, the government would be borrowing money in order to
invest it in the market, which does not increase the total amount
of national savings. Economists like to see a high savings rate,
because it means money is available for companies to use for growth
and improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan also said he preferred using the budget surpluses to
pay down the federal debt, which would boost national savings.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, said Gebhardtsbauer, the government would force
interest rates higher by borrowing money in order to invest in
stocks. And when it buys stocks, it diverts profits to the Social
Security system that would have otherwise gone to private
investors.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, investments by the Social Security system should not
change stock prices. ``Stock prices react to supply and demand in
the short term. But in the long term, the price of a stock is
determined by a company's profit potential,'' said Greg Jones,
chief economist with Briefing.com, an on-line market analysis firm.
``That shouldn't change just because another buyer is out there.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the real world, others said, the market would only rise
if the Social Security system made regular, dependable stock
purchases. ``It gives an oomph to the stock market,'' said Peter
Cardillo, chief strategist at Westfalia Investments, a New York
brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   ``With additional flows coming in one way or another, this can't
be a negative for the market,'' said Jeffrey Schaefer, a consultant
to the Securities Industry Association, a trade group. ``It can
only hurt if people see the government intervening in the market or
changing what we see as a relatively free market right now.''

AUDIENCES FOR ESPN, SI PLAY IN DIFFERENT LEAGUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes, sporting events don't live up to the pregame hype.
When Disney launched ESPN the Magazine in March, practically every
story played up the high-noon showdown with Time-Warner-Turner's
venerable Sports Illustrated. (The headlines read: ``ESPN creates
rumble at the newsstand,'' ``One on one with SI,'' ``Rumble in the
asphalt jungle,'' and last but not least, ``ESPN putting the press
on Sports Illustrated,'' atop a column written by yours truly.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even after what Mediaweek editor Bill Gloede calls a
``remarkable launch,'' with ESPN the Magazine already posting a
circulation of 700,000, the ``rumble'' turned out to be more like a
minor jostling. By seeking out a markedly younger niche _ the
median age of an ESPN reader is 29 compared with 37 for Sports
Illustrated _ the biweekly has managed an impressive liftoff while
barely ruffling the Sports Illustrated franchise and its 3.2
million circulation. And that's not by accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were to drop the (ESPN) magazine on every SI reader, 90
percent would reject it,'' says David Cole, publisher of the News
Inc. media newsletter. ``You don't spit into the wind,'' adds
Gloede. ``And you don't go head to head with SI.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not like ESPN isn't claiming some Sports Illustrated
casualties. A shiny media kit hailing ESPN the Magazine as ``1998
Rookie of the Year'' boasts of forcing SI to redesign, and to lower
its newsstand price. And ESPN says that since its launch, its rival
has lost 17 percent of its male readers between the ages of 18 and
34 and suffered a significant drop in newsstand sales during the
first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Sports Illustrated did reduce its newsstand price from $3.50 to
$2.95 this summer (ESPN's is $2.99) and implemented graphic
innovations that it was loathe to call a redesign. But according to
Sports Illustrated president Michael Klingensmith, the magazine
lost about 9 percent _ not 17 percent _ of its 18-34 male
``audience'' between April and October of the past year, something
he sees as a minor blip, not a serious trend. And while Sports
Illustrated did have a relatively weak first half of 1998 on the
newsstands, its newsstand sales for the second half of 1998 were up
a solid 32 percent over the same period in 1997. Meanwhile,
Klingensmith projects record ad revenues of around $550 million in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   What should not be obscured in this blizzard of competing
numbers is that ESPN had one hell of a first year. ``They may be
one of the first companies ever to take television and translate it
into print,'' says Gloede. ESPN the Magazine ``had to be for the
reader who grew up on MTV,'' says its spokeswoman Kim Shapiro. The
36- or 37-year-old Sports Illustrated reader ``didn't grow up that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Cruel, but true. ESPN's oversize format, hyperkinetic graphics,
and pushy pacing strains the gray matter of anyone with graying
temples: 34 percent of its readers are between 18 and 24 and only 9
percent are 45 or older. Ask a baby boomer to flip through ESPN the
Magazine and he'll end up shaking his head the way his parents did
at the first sighting of the Beatles and their infernal rock 'n'
roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 44 and a lot of what's in ESPN, including the visuals,
give me a headache,'' says Gloede. ``But that's the way it's
supposed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   When both Sports Illustrated and ESPN the Magazine recently
featured New York Jets receiver Keyshawn Johnson on their covers,
the language and photos betrayed the publications' core
constituencies. SI pictured him snagging a pass during a game and
described him as ``New York's wondrous wideout.'' ESPN the Magazine
featured him glaring at the reader and declaring: ``They Gave Me
the Damn Ball! Now We're Money.'' That's what's known as an
attitude gap.
</P>
<P>
   If there's room for two Keyshawns on the cover, there's room for
SI and ESPN the Magazine on the newsstand. Klingensmith describes
ESPN's impact on his magazine as that of a rock landing in the
ocean and compares the overlap in readership to ``Rolling Stone
versus Entertainment Weekly.''
</P>
<P>
   Is he low-balling the potential threat posed by ESPN the
Magazine, particularly as its young readers age? Sure, a little. If
you're Sports Illustrated, ``I think you care (about ESPN),'' says
Cole. ``But I also think you're going to really be careful about
changing such a proven success.''
</P>
<P>
   Which means that if Sports Illustrated ever really goes to war
against its ESPN rival, it will use a proxy army. Given Time Inc.'s
ability to produce spinoffs _ such as the year-old Teen People _
observers suspect that some kind of Sports Illustrated for Gen Xers
might be the weapon of choice.
</P>
<P>
   Currently getting ready for the March publication of Sports
Illustrated for Women, Klingensmith says, ``It would not be
inaccurate to say we're clearly interested in the younger part of
the market. . . . Could we come up with something that was
complementary for SI for the younger segment?'' Perhaps not a
strictly rhetorical question.
</P>
<P>
   Gloede figures that Sports Illustrated is ``going to respond at
some point,'' but his suggested title seems a bit ham-handed: ``SI
for the pre-Viagra set.''

DOWNHILLERS ON THE EDGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WAITSFIELD, Vt. _ Former US Ski Team member Doug Lewis put the
art of downhill racing thusly: ``Sit on a chair in the middle of a
room. Then lean back as far as you can and try to stop just as
you're about to fall over backwards. If you go too far, you will
fall over backwards. But you have to go over far enough to get to
the very edge.''
</P>
<P>
   That edge, according to Lewis, is where a downhill ski racer
operates. ``If you don't go far enough to get to that edge, you
might as well not show up to race.''
</P>
<P>
   Many ski races are held every year in New England but very few
fans have ever seen a real downhill race, the most extreme speed
discipline there is in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   If a slalom runs up to 20 miles per hour, a giant slalom at 40,
and a super-G at 60, you can correctly assume that a downhill racer
reaches speeds of 80 m.p.h. It is the combination of daredevil and
artistry that makes downhill racing what another former US
downhiller, Andy Mill, once termed ``the most exciting thing that
can happen in skis.''
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, downhill racing returns to New England when
Sugarbush hosts the fourth stop on the Ford Downhill Series'
half-million-dollar tour, which began at Aspen Jan. 9.
</P>
<P>
   At Sugarbush, Tommy Moe, winner of gold (downhill) and silver
(super-G) medals at the 1994 Olympics in Lillehammer, teams up with
AJ Kitt, a veteran downhiller who raced in four Olympics over a
12-year career.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is real racing,'' said Kitt Monday night from Steamboat
Springs, Colo., where he planned to test his newly healed broken
wrist. ``We're hitting speeds pushing 80 miles an hour, and if you
make a mistake, get off your line, you're into the net.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitt never did get in any racing in Steamboat, but another
newly-retired American World Cup veteran, Kyle Rasmussen, filled in
ably. The US comes into Sugarbush with a slight team lead and Moe
holds an equally slim individual edge after placing fifth, first,
and third in his first three races.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition is of equal pedigree, with former Olympic
medalists and top World Cup racers taking part in the two days of
racing.
</P>
<P>
   Team Austria includes Olympic gold medalist Leonard Stock (Lake
Placid) and silver medalist Peter Wirnsberger.
</P>
<P>
   Team Canada has Felix Belczyk, a former World Cup champion, and
three-time World Cup winner Rob Boyd.
</P>
<P>
   Team France features last season's overall World Cup champion,
Luc Alphand, and Adrien Duvillard.
</P>
<P>
   Team Switzerland includes former world championship gold
medalist Franz Heinzer, world championship silver medalist Conradin
Cathomen, and Daniel Mahrer, an eight-time World Cup gold medalist
and three-time Olympian.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's training times will determine the starting order for
the first round. Then each competitor makes two runs, with the
fastest total time determining the winner.
</P>
<P>
   In the second run, the pace is set by the slowest skier in the
first run, with the order slowest to fastest.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, the last skier of the day has the best shot to
win, since he has the least time to make up. But does he press to
give himself a comfortable margin _ risking a crash _ or take it
easy and risk blowing the lead?
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not be the same as World Cup,'' said Kitt, ``but this
is very serious racing. Some of the (Aspen) courses are very narrow
in some sections, and there's little room for error. Your have to
keep your line. You're either in the course or in the net.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitt is referring to the line a downhiller must take to set up
each turn and jump. When a racer gets off line coming into a turn,
he either strains so hard to get back that he risks a disastrous
high-speed fall or he ends up being disqualified for going off
course.
</P>
<P>
   According to Kitt, what makes the Ford Downhill Series serious
is money. The prize for the top individual in each race is
$100,000.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, points are awarded at each event, with the top
seven finishers at tour's end earning a total of $32,000, and
members of the top five teams earning a total of $68,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``For that kind of money,'' said Kitt, ``the point of view gets
a little skewed. TV has to work and you have to keep the sponsors
happy. On the World Cup circuit that's the last thing you think
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Is the Ford Downhill Series the same as World Cup?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are differences,'' said Kitt, who left the World Cup
tour after 12 years mainly because the European travel became a
grind. ``The runs are typically about a minute (half of World Cup),
and the turns are not as turny and the jumps not as big. But you
can't relax. It's still a full-speed, all-out downhill. You can't
ever relax racing downhill.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sugarbush race will be televised on Fox Feb. 21.

SNOWMOBILING IS A DISTURBING TREND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The couple was snowshoeing through the pristine uplands of the
Connecticut River Valley in Pittsburg, N.H. The rolling fields
shimmered with the whiteness of absolution, and the trees in the
forest beyond were powdered with new sugar, giving the evergreen
boughs a look of woolly, Grandma-knit Christmas sweaters.
</P>
<P>
   It was, said the man, a writer who detests the word for its
overuse, simply ``awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   The two plunged on, their lungs filling deeply with cold, clean
air, muscles warming pleasantly as they strode. Running ahead,
their yellow lab pup cavorted in the snow, darting out and back and
snapping jawsful of powder. It was that sort of day, in short, that
gives one a sense of life's permanent goodness. Anything might
happen tomorrow or next week, but this is real, this is just so . .
. perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Then something did happen.
</P>
<P>
   It started like a high buzz of mosquito quality. It got louder.
It was coming their way.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they knew what the noise was long before the two
snowobiles popped out of the woods and raced down the slope below
them. Then, engines screaming, the machines slashed up past the
snowshoeing couple, both members of which held the dog by the
collar. One rider waved merrily with a heavy black mitten, and then
the two were gone, leaving a smell of burnt fuel and motor oil
hanging in the air for at least as long as it took the noise of the
engines to recede into the white silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where,'' said the woman at last, ``is a lake with open water
when you need one?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Disgusting,'' said her husband. ``Absolutely disgusting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do people think that's fun?'' his wife asked.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the world is in a wrangling mood these days. We are
developing the habit of taking sides, no matter what, and those
readers whose heart is with the skiers are boiling mad at the very
thought of fossil fuel-burning machines trammeling the almost pious
beauty of the winter countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, a mirror image of this scenario plays out in
summer when canoists or sailors, despite their grudging acceptance
of stinkpots using the same waters they do, encounter a bunch of
jet skis making that maddeningly pulsating whine, ``Waaa waaa waaa
waaa.'' From the deck of a moored boat or from a veranda on the
shore, it is enough to sour the very lime in one's Mount Gay.
</P>
<P>
   But back to the winter version, our couple in Pittsburg, N.H.,
like thousands of people who cross-country ski in wilderness
settings, cannot really believe that snowmobiles are allowed.
</P>
<P>
   How can something that makes such a hideous noise and smell,
that does untold damage to the underbrush, that opens deeryards to
predators that might not reach them otherwise, be allowed to exist?
</P>
<P>
   There has always been a class war in the woods. Do not forget
that before 1936, when Alpine skiing was introduced to Olympic
competition, it was largely frowned upon by the skiing
establishment. Skiing then meant three-pin gear and free heels. The
way down was Telemark turning and jumping off ramps.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, Alpine skiers are frowned upon to a degree by the
more purist of the cross-country set, who consider riding up a
diesel-driven lift to slide back down highly groomed machine-made
snow (once called ``artificial'') hardly much better than tearing
around the woods in a motor driven sled. Alpine skiing, say these
purists, amounts to no more than an amusement park ride, more akin
to an Alpine water slide than a true outdoor sport.
</P>
<P>
   We who ski know better, of course, but the point remains that
purity is in the eye of the beholder, and in fact some
cross-country waxers look down their frozen noses at folks who use
waxless skis with fishscale kick zones.
</P>
<P>
   Also consider the resistence that Alpine skiers had to
snowboarders, not that that war zone is totally quiet these days.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, back-country bushwhacking skiers write to me to
complain about the proliferation of snowmobiles (users call them
``snow machines'') in the northern wilderness, and urge me to write
about these devils in God's country. Tell the truth about how
they're ruining the outdoors for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, those offended are so offended that they believe laws
must be passed severely restricting the infernal devices. Indeed,
from the Aroostook tundra to the lake country of Rangeley, Maine,
from the Connecticut Lakes to the Northeast Kingdom, snomobilers
rule with their snapping two-cycle horsepower, their strange, Darth
Vader costumes, their beer-sloshing nights. Still, they bring many
bucks into corners of the North that do not ordinarily reap a
payoff from any sort of skier traffic. Just ask the Rangeley town
manager about the $5 million annual windfall from the sleds.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, skiers and snowshoers and unmotorized wilderness
partakers of every persuasion whose hearts sink at the distant
sound of a snowmobile assault on the senses and sensibilities.
They're part of the picture for good.
</P>
<P>
   You must try to find consolation in the wonderfully snobbish
conclusion that, after all, there's just no accounting for taste.

THIS LADY TAKES CLOWNING AROUND SERIOUSLY

<P>
   NISKAYUNA, N.Y. _ Growing up, Marie Beck dreamed of being a
Broadway star.
</P>
<P>
   She never made the Great White Way. But she has a Golden Nose.
She's the Dean of the Joyful Joeys. And this summer, she will share
the spotlight with stars of another kind _ some of the greatest
clowns of all time.
</P>
<P>
   It all began in 1979, when a clown friend working a church
bazaar invited her along. Beck nearly begged off, but, she
realized, she always did have a comic streak. In her Broadway
dream, her role models were goofballs like Red Skelton and Carol
Burnett.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did have the clown in me, but I never thought of it that
way,'' she said. ``I put on the makeup and I had a ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years later, Beck, 57, is having the best laugh: She's
been named Clown of the Year by Clowns of America International,
one of the top awards in the trade. It follows her award last
August of the Golden Nose, a top regional prize.
</P>
<P>
   For the achievement, she'll be the cover clown on COAI's
magazine, The New Calliope, and be honored in August at the Clown
Hall of Fame's annual dinner in Milwaukee, at which some of
history's most famous clowns, including Emmett Kelly and Bob
``Bozo'' Bell, have been inducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the way we honor the clowns that are out there doing
the everyday work, making a difference in people's lives,'' said
Hall of Fame Executive Director Kathryn O'Dell.
</P>
<P>
   Beck is known mainly as Mischief, a name she took from her
husband Jerry's habit of saying she was up to something ``Because I
see the mischief in your eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Mischief is her nom de clown for birthdays and other
commercial work, Beck, like many clowns, has a religious side. She
founded a ministry, ``The Joyful Joeys,'' named for the father of
modern clowning, Joseph Grimaldi (1778-1837). She does religious
theme clowning in churches under the name Delight (as in, ``I'm de
light of de Lord.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it's the easiest thing in the world to tell a joke and
make people smile,'' she said. ``Whatever I have in life, I got it
from my God. It's a gift.''
</P>
<P>
   She does service work, too, raising money for hospice and the
sudden infant death syndrome, and holding office in clown clubs,
including the Electric City Clown Alley in Schenectady, whose
president, Rennie Gagnon, nominated her for the award.
</P>
<P>
   In the Clowns on Rounds program, she visits hospital patients
under the alias Dr. Funnybones. And she's has mentored some who now
teach tomorrow's clowns.
</P>
<P>
   COAI President Judy Quest called Beck ``a clown's clown,'' and
said her versatility and ability to get along with colleagues made
her stand out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people in this business are pretty people,'' Quest said.
``Other people are good at a specialty. But she, across the board,
was excellent. And other clowns respect her so much; let's face it,
there's a lot of egos in clowning.''
</P>
<P>
   Offstage, Beck juggled being a single mother of five before her
second marriage to Jerry Beck, and a 25-year career as a state day
care licensing official before retiring in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly obsessive, Beck spends three to four days a week at
her craft. She's taken classes in mime, juggling and ventriloquism
(no singing: ``I have the voice of a frog.''), and filled a room
with awards and accessories.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went to my first party, I knew two or three things to
do,'' she said. ``I don't know what I did for an hour. Now, I could
probably entertain from 7 in the morning till 12 at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that it's always been a bed of squirting roses. There's the
occasional heckler or magic know-it-all; mostly, she said, she
views them as a challenge. She'll invite them to help blow up
sculpting balloons _ an almost impossible task for the novice _ or
put a twist in a classic trick.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can get one of them to say to the other, boy, she's
good, you've won them over,'' Beck said.
</P>
<P>
   She's amused kids internationally from Ecuador to Bosnia, where
several years ago she entertained some 300 children without knowing
their language, while fighting raged 30 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   For all the trappings and tricks, though, she says the art comes
down to something basic and internal.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you need to be a clown is, you need to like people and you
need to have a sense of humor,'' she said. ``And then you can go
anywhere with it.''

ZE HOPES TO GO FROM DEPARTMENT STORE CLERK TO REVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like any prospective employee, Joao Batista de Jesus Rodrigues
Pinto tried to make a favorable impression during his job interview
at a shoping mall in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Ze Rodrigues, as he was known while competing with some of the
top soccer players in Europe, had had an adventurous existence
after leaving Cape Verde to play soccer in Europe in 1989. He had
immersed himself in a foreign culture, learned to speak Dutch,
survived attacks from rivals and corrupt agents, then gave up the
game after falling in love and moving to Boston. Now he had learned
English, but he might as well have been speaking Latin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them about playing against Romario, who at the time was
the best player in the world,'' he said. ``And they didn't even
know who he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Ze Rodrigues became a manager in the accessories and handbags
department of Filene's and concentrated on raising his daughter,
Elle. Like thousands of other immigrants, Ze Rodrigues was immersed
in the economy, contributing to American society, and content.
</P>
<P>
   But Rodrigues was also miscast: a lean, 5-foot-11-inch, talented
athlete who had been trained to perform in the world's most popular
sport but could not get a game. Rodrigues wanted to prepare for the
business world after retirement, but he was not yet prepared to
retire _ which could be fortunate for the Revolution, who plan to
take him to preseason training in Italy. If Ze Rodrigues succeeds,
the Revolution will have gained an experienced forward with US
citizenship. He could be a diamond in the rough similar to Jair,
who last year became a starter and introduced Ze Rodrigues to the
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could add a new dimension to the offense which the
Revolution have never had,'' Boston-based agent Patrick McCabe
said. ``He will be valuable because he can hold the ball up, take
people on, he's very versatile, and he has a knack for the goal,
plus he can help develop the younger guys such as Johnny Torres and
Jamar Beasley.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a take-charge leader, and they haven't had many of those.
He's a professional, he has the right attitude, he's humble, and
he's hungry. He'll do most of the talking with his feet. He won't
say he's the greatest. He wants to prove it on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rodrigues already proved himself in Holland, where he was
discovered playing in an all-Cape Verdean tournament in 1988. He
played for Sparta Rotterdam under an amateur contract before
encountering visa problems. He then went to Caldas Sport Clube in
Portugal's second division and helped the team to two second-place
finishes.
</P>
<P>
   But Rodrigues was not getting any younger, he was far from the
first division, and his agent wasn't returning calls. Instead of
promoting him, coach Francisco Vital was doing the opposite,
according to Rodrigues.
</P>
<P>
   The situation called for a vacation, and Rodrigues returned home
to Praia. He went to the beach, where a friend introduced him to
Dee, a model from Boston. They began a long-distance relationship
while Rodrigues continued playing in Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided to come to Boston and we were married June 3,
1995,'' Rodrigues said. ``I knew about the MLS and I thought I
could make a career here. Unfortunately, I didn't know anybody and
my wife doesn't have any connections in soccer. I didn't know where
to start, so I didn't play. Oh, I played for fun and to stay in
shape. I trained with the Connecticut Wolves and I was going to
play for them, but it's a long commute and I was working.''
</P>
<P>
   The Major League Soccer talent net failed to collect Rodrigues.
And the Revolution might have passed on him, except that he
qualifies as a domestic player through marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a fair amount of guys like Ze in the US,'' said
McCabe, who played soccer and taught in South Africa. ``They are
usually from Latin America or Africa. They have come here through
marriage or for work. There is a lot of unearthed talent if you
look hard enough. Some of them can't get in because of the rules,
the limits on foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the league and the fans are missing out because of that.
If you go to any ethnic neighborhood, you can probably find a guy
who can play on an MLS team. There are probably a couple more under
our nose in Boston and Rhode Island. These are kids who don't have
access to resources, who are not in the loop. They are not on the
select teams because they have other things which are more
important _ a job or school. They have a different focus.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ze Rodrigues's father was a customs agent in Cape Verde and
raised 21 children with two wives. The oldest, Joca, played in
Portugal for Sporting Braga in the 1950s and '60s. The family was
relatively affluent and was among the first to acquire a video
cassette recorder. Four of Ze Rodrigues's brothers moved to Holland
and sent tapes of soccer games. Rodrigues slept with a soccer ball
as a pillow and took advantage of the VCR to watch the tapes.
</P>
<P>
   He joined Sparta Rotterdam and soon displaced an aging national
team candidate, who then attempted to discredit him, according to
Rodrigues. Newspaper reports describe him as ``unstoppable''
against top teams such as Ajax, PSV, and Rotterdam rival Feyenoord.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very good technical player,'' said Charles Van Der
Steene, a Feyenoord director for more than 25 years.
``Unfortunately, he really only played one year for us. He was a
productive player, not only a technical player but one who could
score goals. With the qualities he had then, he could have played
anywhere. He wanted to stay here, but there were problems with his
status. Now it wouldn't be any problem.''
</P>
<P>
   A European Court of Justice ruling, known as the Bosman
Decision, has since facilitated the assimilation and movement of
players, leading to European teams being loaded with foreigners.
But in the early '90s, clubs such as Sparta had all domestic
players.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sparta coach Rob Jacobs helped Rodrigues pursue a work
visa, which would have allowed him full professional status, but
the system stalled. A Portuguese agent, Angelo Martins, offered
assistance, and Rodrigues departed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the biggest mistake I ever made,'' Rodrigues said. ``I
was frustrated. But once I got to Portugal, he didn't help me. He
had more than 100 players, and you can't function properly as an
agent with that many players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really like it in Portugal because I came from a top
division and I got dumped into the second division. It was very
hard for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodrigues's story is common in Europe, where clubs recruit
around the world for cheap young talent. For several thousand
dollars, a prospect's club and family can be paid off, and the
player can become worth millions. Many African players are now
successful, but many more are not. In the United States, many
prospects simply go unobserved, often because of cultural or
linguistic barriers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rodrigues emerged during a tournament involving Cape Verdean
teams in Brockton, Mass. last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were many talented players, but I don't know if there
were any scouts,'' Rodrigues said. ``I know a whole bunch of guys
who could be pros, both in Boston and Cape Verde, but they didn't
meet the right person or have the right connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it is luck. If I had a Portuguese passport, or Dutch
or US passport, I wouldn't be sitting here now.''
</P>
<P>
   While Rodrigues talked, he greeted co-workers, few of whom
appeared aware of his sporting past. But if Rodrigues impresses
during the Revolution's training excursion next month, his
low-profile status in his new country will end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have natural talent, and I think I can bring something to
the team,'' he said. ``I can bring movement with and without the
ball, play good combinations, one-twos. I'm almost unstoppable in
one-on-one situations. I can turn and go to the goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fortunate to accomplish my dream for a while, and thank
God. It didn't last long, but I'm looking forward to getting back.
I'm very excited and I feel rejuvenated. I haven't felt this way
for a while. It's like when you are a child and you get a present
and you are all excited. I can't wait.''

THERE'S NOTHING LIKE AN ART FRAME YOU MADE YOURSELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is nothing quite like a nice-looking frame to set off a
piece of art.
</P>
<P>
   In art museums you can see the art framed in many kinds of
frames, from plain to rococo to Byzantine back to plain again. The
variety is infinite, but each frame seems to complement the art;
one frame does not overwhelm a delicate drawing or painting,
another is not so plain as to underplay a bold, colorful painting.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, framing is an art in itself.
</P>
<P>
   Fancy frames are great in museums and castles and palaces, but
they don't necessarily go well in your house.
</P>
<P>
   Framing and reframing your art, and hanging it in a favorite
spot in the house, is a good winter project.
</P>
<P>
   One rule of thumb, however, is this: If the frame costs more
than the art, something's wrong. It should not be that way.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of frame shops around to handle your art; they
are good but pricey. Some frame shops let you frame your own art,
right in the store, for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy frames at variety stores and department stores at
reasonable prices, and they include the glass, which is a good part
of the cost of framing.
</P>
<P>
   They usually come in black, ``natural'' (varnished), and dark
stained, and are pretty plain. That plainness may be an asset,
though, because in a house (not a palace or museum), fanciness or
ornateness may not fit. In fact, in a house, the plainer and
narrower the frame, the better.
</P>
<P>
   Another source of inexpensive frames are antique shops. What you
see is what you get in an antiques shop. Some of them look pretty
awful _ dirty, mostly _ but with a little detergent and water they
clean up to almost new.
</P>
<P>
   And, you can make your own frames out of wood molding. Lumber
stores carry many varieties of molding, from simple quarter-rounds
to elaborate crown molding. Such moldings are usually pine, but
some are oak.
</P>
<P>
   Many of today's moldings are plastic, OK for house trim but not
for framing.
</P>
<P>
   You can put two or more moldings together to make the frame of
your choice. Any size, any shape to fit the art. Or, you can buy
molding designed for picture framing. It is called, logically,
picture frame moldings, and is sold in art supply shops and
catalogs such as Rockler Woodworkers' Store.
</P>
<P>
   Such molding, of oak, is 3/4, 1, and 1 1/8 inches thick. It
costs from $4.99 to $9.99 for a four-foot length, so you can see
why professional framing is expensive.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need a lot of tools for framing, but three things are
essential: A smooth, level work surface; a miter box; and a framing
clamp. The latter item holds the mitered moldings in the right
shape with 90-degree corners while you glue and nail everything
together. If you have ever tried to glue and nail two mitered
pieces together, you will appreciate a framing clamp. They are sold
in art supply shops and some catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   As for the miter box, you can get one for $15 or one up to
hundreds. Settle for a compromise and buy one at maybe $30. With
practice, you can cut a true 45-degree angle in molding.
</P>
<P>
   Other tools are a back saw (with the miter box), hammer, drill
for predrilling nail holes in hardwood, glass cutter, and brads.
And, yellow carpenter's glue.
</P>
<P>
   How you finish a frame is your business, but oak is usually
stained and varnished, pine can be stained and varnished or
painted. It is better, I think, to stain and varnish any frame. Or,
leave oak ``natural'' and just varnish it. And, in some cases, you
may not have to, or even want to, varnish over a stain.
</P>
<P>
   If you paint, use a flat or at least a subdued satin gloss. For
varnish, use a satin or semigloss finish.
</P>
<P>
   Hardwoods look good varnished and not stained. Pine does not.
</P>
<P>
   Guard against bright colors of paint or stain; they can
overwhelm the art.
</P>
<P>
   There is still plenty to do: Matting, for example. You can mat
art in various sizes to make it fit the frame. Drawings, original
prints, and pastels should be matted and placed under glass; but
the glass should not touch the art. This is especially true of
pencil, charcoal, pastel, and other materials that can be rubbed
off. That is what mats are for, in addition to allowing odd-sized
art to fit in an odd-sized frame.
</P>
<P>
   To mat a picture, you need a utility knife, a mat cutter, a
large framing square that also acts as a straight edge, a brad
pusher, and a brad setter. The mat cutter is one that cuts at a
bevel, which all inside mat edges should have; that is, the edges
of the window cut in the mat.
</P>
<P>
   A brad setter is a pliers-like tool that allows neat inserting
of brads to hold glass, mat, art, and backer board on the frame. A
brad pusher is a small tool for, well, pushing brads. Just set a
brad in the end of the tool and push for quick and clean
insertions. These items are sold in art supply shops and catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   If your art is paper (no oils) and it is valuable, it is best to
use an acid-free mat board. It's pricier than standard board, but
it will help prevent paper from foxing, little rust marks that show
up when there is slight moisture. A backer board should also be
acid free.
</P>
<P>
   And the art? Commercial reproductions are not art, and some are
priced very high, in the hundreds of dollars. If you try to sell a
reproduction, you are unlikely to recoup that investment.
</P>
<P>
   Since most of us cannot afford oils, let alone art, consider
prints that are called original prints, in which the artist had a
hand. Lithographs, etchings, woodcuts, and serigraphs (silk
screens) are examples, and there are many by long-dead, famous
artists as well as very-much alive, contemporary artists. Art
galleries and some antiques stores carry such original prints.
</P>
<P>
   They may be pricey, but it's better to spend a few hunded on a
small print than the same amount on a reproduction, which has no
value at all. You can usually recoup all or more of their value if
you sell them.
</P>
<P>
   By the way: The framing square mentioned earlier has nothing to
do with framing pictures but has everything to do with framing
houses.
</P>
<P>
   But it also works well to make right angles and straight cuts
when you are ready to cut that mat.

A PASSION FOR THE PYM AND PROPER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ellen Miller has two fears about the first meeting of the
Barbara Pym Society of North America. The first is that too few
people will attend, the second that too many will show up and
overflow the conference room.
</P>
<P>
   Given Pym's hold on readers' imaginations, Miller's second fear
seems likelier than the first. In any event, she doesn't expect a
mob. ``Forty to 50 people, I imagine,'' she said. ``But you never
know how many Pym fans there are out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Interest in Pym's work surged in the late 1970s, after she was
named one of the ``most underrated novelists of the century'' in
the Times Literary Supplement. In the 1950s Pym had published six
well-received novels, but in the early 1960s two of her books were
rejected by publishers and she stopped writing. After the Times
accolade the rejected novels were swiftly published. She wrote
three more before she died in 1980. All her novels were
republished. Some are still in print.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is a novelist to savor,'' said Miller. ``Her books are so
re-readable. You find different things about characters, things you
missed before, every time you read her.''
</P>
<P>
   Pym probably would be amazed at the attention her work continues
to attract. In England there's a Barbara Pym Society that meets
annually at St. Hilda's College, Oxford, where Pym was a student in
the 1930s. There's a Pym home page and a chat room on the Web. St.
Hilda's has a Barbara Pym Fellow in English. There are plans afoot
for a Pym journal and a literary prize. Her work is studied in
universities where a new generation of readers considers her
treatment of spinsters from a feminist perspective and how she
``subverts the paradigm,'' as one academic put it, of the romance
novel.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's the Barbara Pym Society of North America, launched
by Miller, director of publications at Harvard Law School, where
the meeting will take place on April 9 and 10 (e-mail:
miller(at)law.harvard.edu). Miller discovered Pym in the early
1980s. ``I was totally enthralled by `Quartet in Autumn','' she
said. ``Very few books have ever affected me the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Pym has an undeserved reputation as ``prim Pym,'' a ``ladies'''
novelist, an assessment that ignores her subtle humor and sharp eye
for the frailties and failings of the ``worthy'' unmarried women,
clergymen, academics, cranks, eccentrics, and ordinary people she
wrote about. Her characters are timeless, flawed, authentically
human. ``It's those human qualities that make her so appealing,''
Miller said. ``And in all her books there's a certain level of
irony which makes you smile and sometimes laugh out loud.''
</P>
<P>
   Pym's penetrating way of looking at the world can cause her
readers to view the events of their own lives through a Pym-ish
prism. ``All of us talk about a Pym-ish situation or a Pym-ish
character,'' Miller said. ``Her novels are very, very rich. Give
her a chance to get hold of you, and once she does she can take
over your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller has lined up several speakers, including Barbara Everett
of Somerville College, Oxford, who spoke at last year's meeting of
the Barbara Pym Society in England. Everett will offer her
assessment of Pym's novels and trace her development as a novelist
from ``Excellent Women'' to ``Quartet in Autumn.'' There will be a
dinner, a viewing of two BBC videos about Pym, a reading from one
of the novels, and ``music a la Pym,'' whatever that may be.
(Miller said the musical program has yet to be determined. ) There
will be none of those events so familiar to Pym fans _ no jumble
sale, no coffee morning, no ``hunger'' lunch. But any gathering
that brings together a group of Pym enthusiasts is bound to have
its Pym-ish moments.

WELCOME TO THE WILDLIFE CAFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm running a cafe outside my kitchen window. It's a small slice
of life.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, about a dozen scruffy sparrows are lounging on
the snowy branches of my forsythia bush. Having filled their
bellies with corn and sunflower seed, they're taking a post-
breakfast break, enjoying the drama of the passing scene. Like
tweedy undergraduate students, they have a knack for loafing.
</P>
<P>
   The starlings have also arrived. I don't know what they've done
to their hair. They look like they've had a run-in with a buzz saw.
They wrestle for the spots next to the food, playing king of the
mountain as they fight for a single perch on top of the metal cage
full of peanut butter squares hanging from a wrought-iron pole.
Take a look at those shiny black jackets with pale yellow slashes.
They must be in a gang.
</P>
<P>
   A male woodpecker, wearing a tux, is half hidden over there in
the rhododendron. He's my most persnickety patron, touching nothing
that isn't served in suet, one of the many specialty items on the
menu. He never brings his mate along. Like many young professional
couples I know, the woodpeckers seem to have an unspoken agreement
to follow their own bliss, no questions asked. The mourning doves,
understated in their tan cashmere vests, also give my restaurant a
certain class. They keep to themselves, gathering on my neighbor's
roof before they deign to descend en masse. They avoid the
hurly-burly at the feeder by stalking the seeds that have fallen to
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The chickadees twitter and flutter, so restless they can't sit
still for a minute, while the tufted titmice are so well-mannered
and serene, I'm surprised they don't bring a book to read. This
cafe sure attracts characters. Around noon today, two cardinal
couples stopped by, dressed to the teeth. When a third male showed
up, he was quickly given the bum's rush right out of the
neighborhood. The female cardinals are such perfect ladies that I
was surprised to discover that their mates were bullies, but now,
of course, I understand why they're always masked.
</P>
<P>
   Most hoodlums don't want to be picked out in a lineup.
</P>
<P>
   The bluejays, meanwhile, strut their stuff. Like pro athletes
with million-dollar contracts, they go to the head of the line and
refuse to make way for anyone else. Because of the lightly falling
snow, the cardinals and bluejays are larger than life today. I'd
never seen them puff themselves up to increase the loft in their
feathers before. A few breaths and they turned into fuzzy-red and
blue-gray balloons, as soft and round and warm as teddy bears. I
wanted to reach out and stroke them.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the squirrels, whom I want to choke.
</P>
<P>
   I watched one this morning, cursing the metal cube that holds
the suet because it twirled around as he tried to squat on it. He
was obviously short on patience because after a few unsatisfactory
attempts, he finally jumped to the feeder. He spread himself out,
reclining like a pasha, the better to savor his 10-course meal. He
and his kind are the only customers I have who think I'm offering
an all-you-can-eat buffet. For free, of course. And they aim to get
their money's worth.
</P>
<P>
   My presence on the other side of the window doesn't affect the
squirrels the way it does the birds. My feathered customers are
alert to my every sudden move, but the squirrels have no intention
of being intimidated by anyone behind glass. They insist upon proof
of my existence. The only way I could discourage them would be to
run outside and deliver them the apocalypse on a tray. One of them
gave me a look of such unshakable entitlement today that I finally
realized why he and his pals are so darned arrogant.
</P>
<P>
   The squirrels believe I've set this all out just for them.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure they consider all my other customers nuisances,
inferior forms of life that I haven't yet quite figured out how to
do away with. They're enormously greedy. Only 10 percent of my
clientele, they eat 90 percent of my food. They waste enormous
amounts, spitting all but the choicest morsels into the rubbish
heap they've created under the feeder. So much for an appreciation
of beauty. These guys aren't grateful, either. If they know I'm
watching, they turn their backs and flick their tails at me while
they eat. They think I'm here, like a god, for only one reason _ to
endlessly replenish all their supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Not like a god, really. More like a slave.
</P>
<P>
   To tell the truth, I understand them better than I do my more
lovable clients. I can't help but feel close to them.
</P>
<P>
   They remind me of people.

TERM-LIMITS TURNCOATS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Wash., Colo., Fla.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marty Meehan, a lean and hungry Massachusetts congressman, is
caught in a painful dilemma. He has to decide which means more to
him _ his word or his ambition.
</P>
<P>
   When he ran for the House of Representatives in 1992, Meehan
made an ironclad promise to serve no more than four terms. ``We
should use the liberation of term limits to smash open our
gridlocked yet out-of-control Congress,'' he said. It was a quite a
pledge, particularly for a Massachusetts Democrat, and it helped
propel Meehan to a dramatic primary victory over the four-term
incumbent, Chester Atkins.
</P>
<P>
   Now Meehan is a four-term incumbent himself, and he doesn't want
to leave. He likes being a congressman. He especially likes the
fame he came to know in 1998, when he was involved (albeit on the
losing side) in three of the biggest stories on Capitol Hill: the
campaign finance bill, the tobacco settlement, and the impeachment
of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan can't bear the thought of leaving Congress now, just as
the juicy plums of incumbency are dropping in his lap. But he also
can't bear to be thought untrustworthy, one more hack whose
promises are worthless. So what does he do? Keep his word and walk
away from the House? Or renege, and become one of those slippery
careerists he used to denounce?
</P>
<P>
   Renege, of course.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Meehan has launched a public-relations campaign
to give himself cover to break his vow. He's been making the
rounds, telling one and all _ especially the newspapers _ how
valuable he has become to his constituents. ``I am obviously more
effective today that I was when I arrived,'' he says. ``My district
would be better off with a member of Congress who utilizes his or
her seniority to the advantage of the district.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the tired argument every incumbent makes. But the papers
seem to be buying it. Meehan has harvested a bouquet of sympathetic
columns and editorials, most agreeing with his claim that he is too
valuable to replace. Several have assured him that since term
limits are a stupid idea, he is not bound by his pledge. He has
even been told that going back on a promise can actually be a sign
of ``growth'' and ``independence.''
</P>
<P>
   Meehan isn't alone. At least three other members of Congress,
all Republicans, are poised to abandon their term-limits
commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Rep. Tillie Fowler advocated term limits with passion
when she ran for office in 1992. Her first bill in Congress was a
measure restricting House members to eight years in office and
senators to 12. As recently as last April, Fowler was adamant on
the point. 1998 would be her last congressional campaign, she told
reporters. Friends who urged her not to rule out another run were
wasting their breath. ``I gave my word,'' she reminded them
sharply. Now, with the '98 election safely won, she suddenly has
``a more open mind'' on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Scott McInnis of Colorado also took the eight-year pledge
in 1992. Of the 50 states, Colorado may be the most steadfastly
pro-term limits _ it began the limits avalanche in 1990 with the
first state law limiting congressional tenure. (The Supreme Court
ultimately invalidated all such laws, ruling that only a
constitutional amendment can impose term limits on Congress.) Yet
McInnis now says his signed promise to leave after eight years was
``goofy.'' He never realized, he claims, just how important
seniority is.
</P>
<P>
   The worst betrayal of all, perhaps, is that of Washington's
George Nethercutt. His stunning 1994 upset of Tom Foley, the
powerful speaker of the House, was driven by the term limits issue.
Foley had angered voters by suing to overturn the state's term
limits law; Nethercutt, by contrast, swore he would serve only
three terms and never become a creature of Capitol Hill. But he too
is planning a double-cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``I meant it when I said six years is enough,'' he told the New
York Times, but now he believes six years ``is probably not
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Who can wonder at the cynicism of voters, or the contempt they
express for politicians? Of all the promises candidates make, none
is easier to keep than a promise to leave office after a fixed
number of years. The only condition necessary for its fulfillment
is the promiser's honesty. Unfortunately, when Potomac _ or
statehouse _ fever breaks out, honesty is usually the first
casualty.
</P>
<P>
   As he travels the editorial-board circuit, urging reporters and
editors to bless his forthcoming act of bad faith, Meehan has taken
to rewriting history. ``It was a mistake,'' he told the Boston
Herald, ``to blurt out'' a term-limits pledge during a debate in
1992. He told editors at the Lawrence (Mass.) Eagle-Tribune that
his eight-is-enough vow was a slip of the tongue _ ``a youthful
indiscretion.''
</P>
<P>
   It was nothing of the sort. Meehan's term-limits promise was
deliberate, calculated, and unconditional. He repeated it often. It
was central to his campaign. ``I favor limiting members of Congress
to four terms,'' one of his position papers said, ``and I commit to
serve no longer than that (ital) even if term-limit legislation is
not enacted.'' (unital)
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, Meehan has been an emblem of how effective and
efficient an elected official can be when he knows the term-limits
clock is ticking. If he violates his solemn word, he will become
something much less admirable and much more common: another lying
politician.

 &HT;    Stars of ``Theory'' keep movie a-flight
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Could Kenneth Branagh be channeling the cinematic spirit of Bud
Cort?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Theory of Flight,'' his new picture with off-screen
sweetheart Helena Bonham Carter, combines aspects of two of Cort's
best-known cult flicks. Namely, the quirky ``I'm Flying'' obsession
from ``Brewster McCloud'' and the eccentric love affair from
``Harold and Maude.''
</P>
<P>
   Branagh plays Richard, your typical artist-dreamer-eccentric. As
the film opens, he is decked out in goggles and wings and about to
launch himself off the ledge of a London bank. By the time the
opening credits are finished, Richard has survived his inevitable
fall. But for putting the city to the time and trouble of rescuing
him, he's sentenced to 120 hours of community service.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, he's assigned to care for Jane (Bonham Carter), a
beautiful young woman with Lou Gehrig's disease. Chirps the social
services worker before introducing him to his new charge, ``She's a
handful but tremendous fun!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fun'' may not be the first word that crosses Richard's mind.
Confined to a motorized wheelchair that she navigates with the
heedless ferocity of Richard Petty, her voice as twisted as her
body, Jane has no intention of going gently into anyone's good
night. She likes cyber porn, shoplifting and shocking people with
her foul-mouthed observations.
</P>
<P>
   As the Bud Cort analogies suggest, ``Theory'' is something of a
throwback to the 1960s _ heavy on whimsy and symbolism, light on
stuff like how Jane manages to go to the bathroom. There's even a
speeded-up scene in a hotel room that could have been lifted right
out of a Beatles movie.
</P>
<P>
   So consider yourself warned. If '60s silliness and
sentimentality are a big turnoff, this is probably not your kind of
film. If not, ``Theory'' offers a lovely celebration of the things
that matter _ tenderness, friendship, humanity, desire _ and it
also has two terrific performances. Branagh's Richard may be a
goofball about most things, but his initial reaction to Jane is all
too recognizable. And the way it slowly disappears is artfully
done. His fondness for Jane herself, not Jane the disabled, sneaks
up on us as much as it does on him.
</P>
<P>
   His co-star has the showy, Oscar-bait role, yet there's nothing
showy about her work. Her performance is as original as it is
seductive, eschewing the cliches of the plucky disabled persona.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Theory of Flight'' would have been better if it hadn't
tried to cram in so much plot and merely let us watch the two stars
interact. But even as is, it's a memorable little film whose pluses
far outweigh its minuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Theory of Flight''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kenneth Branagh and Helena Bonham Carter. Directed by
Paul Greengrass. Rated R for language and sexual situations. 1
hour, 38 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Doesn't soar, but the two stars easily keep it
aloft.

 &HT;    A Tarheel takes on Helms
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   They were born in the same North Carolina town, were both raised
Southern Baptists and as young men worked for radio stations and
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and another thing: ``You've been obsessed by homosexual
men,'' says filmmaker Tim Kirkman in voice-over to his odd
doppelganger, Sen. Jesse Helms.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most of my life, so have I.''
</P>
<P>
   In the documentary ``Dear Jesse,'' gay narrator/director Kirkman
returns from his adopted New York to prowl his old stomping grounds
_ and those of Helms, whose remarks against gays and lesbians,
abortion and affirmative action have become, for some, synonymous
with the state itself.
</P>
<P>
   That's a problem for many of the people Kirkman interviews,
North Carolina residents who hate being linked to a representative
whose views they despise. But as Kirkman circles the enigma of
Helms (discovering along the way that the senator was named
``obnoxious'' by classmates in his old yearbook), the movie keeps
from demonizing its elusive subject. Helms even earns a sort of
grudging respect from people who can't abide him but who
acknowledge that the politician is, at least, unwavering in his
beliefs. You always know where he stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Jesse'' may have Helms at its center, but it's also a
portrait of the New South that extends beyond the state's borders.
The film captures cultural tensions that our own state experiences,
with its mix of big city, vital college towns and smaller ZIP codes
where religion is fundamental, in more ways than one.
</P>
<P>
   With his genial, boy-next-door presence, Kirkman is an affable
tour guide. But his niceness almost undoes the movie. Interviewing
writers Lee Smith and Allan Gurganus (who both dislike Helms), as
well as a handful of regular Joes who support their senator, the
film aims for balance but winds up pointedly liberal.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, this is a personal work, best summed up by Kirkman's
attempt to get his camera-shy dad to explain how he, as the father
of a gay son, can support Helms. ``I wonder if he would feel this
way if he had somebody in his own family gay,'' the elder Kirkman
admits. In its evasive, taciturn way, that seems to translate into,
``I love you, son.'' And if only for that, ``Dear Jesse'' is a road
trip worth taking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Jesse''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by Tim Kirkman. Unrated. 1 hour, 22 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: An amusing road trip with a gay man trying to
understand Sen. Jesse Helms.

   `Shakespeare in Love'
</P>
<P>
   There are two great tragedies involved with ``Shakespeare in
Love.'' The first is Shakespeare's masterpiece ``Romeo and
Juliet.'' The second is that this film is only at five metro
(Atlanta) theaters. Excellent writing and flawless performances all
around (even from Ben Affleck, who redeems himself after the
jaw-droppingly awful ``Armageddon''). Don't wait and rent this
film; it's truly worth your seven bucks.

<P>
   `Star Trek: Insurrection'
</P>
<P>
   Futuristic techno-babble aside, there's much fun to be had in
this third film outing with the ``Next Generation'' gang. Director
Jonathan Frakes keeps things blasting along at a lively pace, while
F. Murray Abraham makes a formidable villain; Picard and company
(surprise!) save the day while lightening up and even making time
for the ladies.

</P>
<P>
   `A Civil Action'
</P>
<P>
   This movie characterizes John Travolta as an oxymoron: He's a
``principled lawyer.'' He loses everything in a case he could have
settled, because he let his pride get in the way of his judgment.
Robert Duvall is excellent as the company lawyer who teaches
Travolta that the truth has nothing to do with a court of law.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Schwartz, Chamblee (Ga.)
</P>
<P>
   `The Faculty'
</P>
<P>
   I am definitely not one for ``teen-slasher flicks.'' Well, ``The
Faculty'' does have teenagers, but the only slashing is from
aliens. I doubted the director Robert Rodriguez at first in his
choice for this movie, but after seeing it I was pleasantly
surprised. It has humor, good special effects and great editing.
This one will only intrigue you, not bore you.

THE NEW POLITICS: SAVING MARRIAGES

 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    TALLAHASSEE -- A week after being sworn in as governor of
Florida, Jeb Bush did something no governor had ever done: he
praised 64 pastors for setting aside their differences as Baptists,
Catholics, Methodists and AME Zionists, to create a Tallahassee
Community Marriage Policy aimed at pushing down the area's divorce
rate.
 &HT;    ``We have a 60 percent divorce rate in Leon County, and 35
percent of the most precious, innocent children come into the world
without fathers as out-of-wedlock births,'' Bush said. ``These
problems can be solved if we make commitments, community by
community, that the institution of marriage is important.
 &HT;    ``Therefore, I applaud the pastors and priests who are here
today to begin to save marriages. You can see a dramatic reduction
in the divorce rate. We will see a whole lot of love in its place.
I hope it will be a model for the rest of the state.''
 &HT;    The clergy agreed to require engaged couples to:
 &HT;    --Undergo rigorous premarital preparation that includes at least
five counseling sessions over three to four months.
 &HT;    --Take a premarital inventory such as FOCCUS or PREPARE that can
predict with 80 percent accuracy those who will divorce.
 &HT;    --Take classes on ``a biblical understanding of morality,
marriage and divorce.''
 &HT;    The churches will ``promote sexual abstinence outside of
marriage'' and ``encourage retreats, classes and
marriage-enrichment opportunities designed to build and strengthen
marriages.''
 &HT;    Their most important reform is to train mature married couples
to serve as mentors to those who are ``engaged, newly married,
experiencing marital difficulties, or remarried.''
 &HT;    Rev. Bob Tindale, pastor of Killearn United Methodist Church,
who has recruited 50 mentoring couples, said ``We confess that we
have not done the things that needed to be done. The problems of
marriage are not sociological. They are a failure of us religious
leaders.''
 &HT;    He added, ``Mentoring is a tool we have frankly not used before,
and I am excited about having couples who can stand with those
preparing for marriage, and share on a real-life level.
 &HT;    ``Others who have had severe problems can come back and share
honestly with couples who are now in the same boat. They can share
their very lives with those who have no hope at all.''
 &HT;    The man who inspired him is a parishioner, Richard Albertson,
head of ``Live the Life Ministries,'' who organized the Community
Marriage Policy (CMP).
 &HT;    Albertson told the clergy: ``The divorce revolution has failed.
Judith Wallerstein's research of children of divorce reports that
even after 25 years, that their parents' divorce is the central
event of their lives. The solution is to strengthen marriage.
Married people do better in every way. They live longer, are
healthier, happier and have a better sex life!''
 &HT;    Tallahassee is the 98th city to take this step. This week,
Ventura, Cal. will be the 99th and Culpeper, Va. will be the 100th
on the day after Valentine's Day.
 &HT;    With what result? Consider the impact of Rev. Jeffrey Meyers of
Christ Lutheran Church in Lenexa, Kansas. In May 1996 he persuaded
40 pastors in two Kansas counties across from Kansas City,
Missouri, to adopt a CMP. In 1995, the counties had 1,530 divorces.
By 1997 the number plunged to 1,001, a 34.6 percent drop in two
years.
 &HT;    How was that possible? Forty churches is a small percentage of
area churches. The story got good coverage in the Kansas City Star.
My theory is that people in difficult marriages read the stories
and were encouraged to persevere rather than divorce. And the Lord
blessed the marriage savers.
 &HT;    In the same years, divorces rose modestly in Kansas City itself
and in a suburban county. Why? First, all of the CMP churches are
on the Kansas side of the Missouri River. Second, the Star's
stories about Meyers' marital pioneering appeared in Kansas, not in
Missouri.
 &HT;    In at least 17 other cities that have adopted CMPs, divorces are
dropping 10 times faster than they are in the nation as a whole.
 &HT;    In Eau Claire, Wis., they fell by 7 percent in a year, and by 14
percent in Chattanooga. Compare that with the 1.3 percent decline
of divorces in the United States over twelve years, falling only
from 1,178,000 in 1986 to 1,163,000 in 1997.
 &HT;    I must confess a personal involvement. My wife and I have helped
70 of the 98 cities to create Community Marriage Policies via a
non-profit group called Marriage Savers, which Governor Bush
praised as ``helping people all across this country.''
 &HT;    On Jan. 28, we will address the Wisconsin Assembly. Speaker
Scott Jensen says, ``I am hoping this will build interest in a
proposal I'm developing to help initiate Community Marriage
Policies around the state.''

   POPEADVANCE _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Pope John Paul II comes to the
Midwest as the American Catholic Church and its 61 million members
struggle harder than ever to evangelize Generation Y and to hold on
to young people who have grown up in the church but drifted. Priest
shortages are rampant and the number choosing religious life
dwindles. Crowds of youth will come to see the pope, but dismiss
his moral mandates. As the aged pope nears the end of his papacy,
the future of the church lies in their hands. Will they accept
church law which John Paul has declared ``immutable'' on issues
such as celibacy of priests, birth control, abortion,
homosexuality, and women in the pulpit? A contrasting of their
views with older Catholics. What are the expectations of young

 &HT;    EMBARGOED UNTIL JANUARY 24
 &HT;    A marriage of true minds, one hopelessly lost
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The well is dry, the brain atrophied. Iris Murdoch, the last of
the great 20th-century British writers, has Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, in ``Elegy for Iris,'' a beautifully rendered portrait
by her husband, John Bayley, we are allowed to glimpse the private
sanctuary of the artist's once vital mind. We get to peer through
the opaque windows of a marriage that wouldn't seem nearly so
remarkable had it not spawned such a monumental body of work _ 26
novels that have the Protean grandeur, the intellectual richness,
the lyrical luster of Shakespeare or Proust.
</P>
<P>
   In this heartbreaking account of Murdoch's descent into
nothingness, Bayley has given us a memoir that reaffirms how
suffering can ennoble the human heart. And much to his credit, he
imbues it throughout with the self-deprecating good humor that has
always informed their life together.
</P>
<P>
   Today, theirs is a tale of love in an extreme, almost petrified,
state. Sweetly, playfully communicating like two children on some
enchanted island, they have learned to inhabit a place where words
cannot go. Having always lived in the separateness of their
interior worlds _ Bayley himself is a distinguished writer and
critic _ they have now moved into a singular space. In sickness,
they have found a true marriage, a cure for love.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a certain comic irony _ happily, not darkly comic _
that after more than forty years of taking marriage for granted,
marriage has decided it is tired of this, and is taking a hand in
the game,'' Bayley says at the end of the book. ``Purposefully,
persistently, involuntarily, our marriage is now getting somewhere.
It is giving us no choice _ and I am glad of that.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bayley has written what amounts to a hagiography of his
wife, he courageously tells of his own rage and frustration. And he
is haunted by the harrowing notion that Murdoch might be aware of
her predicament: ``I find her (weeping) as if ashamedly, stopping
as soon as she sees I have noticed. This is so unlike the past; it
is disturbing, too, in another way. It makes me feel she is
secretly but fully conscious of what has happened to her and wants
to conceal it from me.''
</P>
<P>
   As sad as it is, ``Elegy for Iris'' has some genuinely funny
passages. Bayley and Murdoch have always seemed the perfect pair:
he the sweetly bumbling professor, she his brilliant, frumpy wife.
Arriving too late for their wedding, Bayley's mother is not sure
who her son has just married _ Murdoch or her mother.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most hysterical moment is when Bayley goes
snorkeling in Spain _ and loses his teeth: ``An extremely handsome
purple fish which sometimes appeared in the dark blue depths was my
undoing. In my excitement . . . I took in water, then inadvertently
spat out with it my lower denture. I had to give up eating
delicious crisp tapas and crustacea. Even a mild Canary onion was
too much for me. It was like trying to cut with one half of a pair
of scissors.''
</P>
<P>
   This book has touched a nerve in literary circles, in the way
that Ted Hughes' last anguished poems to Sylvia Plath did. It is an
affecting remembrance of one of the great literary marriages of our
time, and it should go far in renewing an interest in Murdoch's
prodigious achievement. In its elegiac and heroic tone, it recalls
Marguerite Yourcenar's ``Memoirs of Hadrian.'' More than any
alabaster monument ever could, it celebrates the victory of life _
and love.

 &HT;    EMBARGOED UNTIL JANUARY 24
 &HT;    Biographers search for elusive spark of life
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Deep into his review of Edmund White's ``Marcel Proust'' and
Larry McMurtry's ``Crazy Horse,'' the biographical details of both
books dispensed with, Peter Ackroyd makes an assertion at once
striking and suspect. ``Style,'' he writes, ``precedes fact.''
Three words, compressed in an aphorism, summing up the art of
biography.
</P>
<P>
   The books are the introductory volumes in the Penguin Lives
series, short biographies _ ``Marcel Proust'' is 165 pages, ``Crazy
Horse'' 148 _ by prominent writers whose only common denominator is
that they write well. Not just with clarity and coherence, but with
imagination and that certain, if indefinable, signature of a
writer. Some are novelists, others scholars, still others
journalists. In volumes to come, Jane Smiley, for example, will
give us Charles Dickens; Edna O'Brien, James Joyce; Garry Wills,
St. Augustine; Peter Gay, Mozart; and Carol Shields, Jane Austen.
</P>
<P>
   All are promising, even novel matchups of author and subject.
But the larger point is that the Penguin biographers are not
cliometricians, academic historians for whom the truth lies not in
the tale but in tables and graphs. Hence Ackroyd's Law, enunciated
in a recent New York Times Book Review.
</P>
<P>
   Ackroyd, himself a novelist and biographer (most recently of
Thomas More), notes that short biographies have always been
popular, beginning with Suetonius' ``Lives of the Caesars,'' and
that the biographies that survive are those that are read and not
embalmed in the academy. Substance, in other words, is as dependent
on style as style is on substance.
</P>
<P>
   `A frenzy to ungrave this man'
</P>
<P>
   ``Style,'' Peter Gay, the most elegant of stylists, once wrote,
``is a centaur, joining what nature, it would seem, has decreed
must be kept apart. It is form and content, woven into the texture
of every art and every craft _ including history. Apart from a few
mechanical tricks of rhetoric, manner is indissolubly linked to
matter; style shapes, and in turn is shaped by, substance.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the place to take up the cudgels in the tired debate
over narrative history (or its offspring, biography) vs. the
so-called New History. It's enough to say that whatever else it
might be, the book that fails to convey a sense of the life lived
is not biography. ``The more I learned about Oliver Wendell
Holmes,'' Catherine Drinker Bowen wrote, ``the more insupportable
it became to think of him as dead, cold and motionless beneath that
stone at Arlington. I found myself possessed by a witch's frenzy to
ungrave this man, stand him upright, see him walk, jump, dance,
tell jokes, make love, display his vanity or courage as the case
might be.''
</P>
<P>
   The private papers, the archives, the whole corpus of what can
be called documented fact takes one only so far. The unraveling of
a person's character through what Michael Holroyd, biographer of
George Bernard Shaw, has called ``the architecture of evidence''
demands something more. It demands that the biographer, like any
artist, possess the intuition and moral imagination to breathe life
into his subject.
</P>
<P>
   And yet veracity makes its legitimate claims. Any biography of
Crazy Horse, as McMurtry acknowledges, is ``an exercise in
assumption, conjecture and surmise.'' Apart from legend and oral
history, little is known about the Sioux chief who was instrumental
in the defeat of Gen. George Custer at the Little Bighorn and later
was assassinated by members of his own tribe. Posthumously, man and
myth almost _ but do not quite _ merge. McMurtry cites a historian
who, puzzled at the contradictions and mystery surrounding Crazy
Horse's life, wondered if he were perhaps ``a kind of Sioux
Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   A subject who lives upon the page
</P>
<P>
   An allusive image, but how true is it? ``That touches on his
charity and on his betrayal,'' McMurtry writes, ``but he was a
determined warrior too, one of the great Resisters, men who do not
compromise, do not negotiate, do not administer, who exist in a
realm beyond the give-and-take of conventional politics.''
</P>
<P>
   True though this may be, it describes him only in terms of
others. The man himself has slipped away, as surely as he did from
the cavalry that hunted him, leaving his biographer with little
more than a longish, highly literary essay on a vanished moment in
time.
</P>
<P>
   Ackroyd puts it squarely: ``One of the secrets of the
biographical art lies in the extent to which the biographer can
intuit the personal stirrings of the individual consciousness; it
is not a question of admiring, or liking, the subject of the
narrative. It is a question of making him, or her, live upon the
page.''
</P>
<P>
   That can be done in a long biography or a short one. Any number
of biographers have given us volume upon volume without raising
their subject from the grave _ indeed, some have only been buried
deeper by footnotes _ while others have given us figures whose
personal stirrings are felt again. At some point, the vital spark
that animates any work of art breaks free of its connection to hard
fact and arcs like electricity. When it does, we recognize it,
because it is the spark that animates life itself.

 &HT;    Kick up your (comfy) heels in new styles for spring
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yes, it truly is the fashion industry's intention to get
well-heeled women into the habit of wearing flat-soled shoes: The
majority of the top designers in New York and Europe shod their
models in flats last year when they unveiled the trendiest looks
for spring/summer 1999.
</P>
<P>
   No, this isn't some diabolical scheme on the designers' part to
drastically, detrimentally alter the way stylish women dress. The
outcropping of longer skirts and Capri pants that came into vogue
last spring will return along with warm weather, and those are the
looks that flats were most often shown with on the runways.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, wearing flats stylishly presents challenges to women who've
grown reliant on heels to make them look taller, thinner, sexier or
more assertive in the workplace; we've all read the many studies
about height enhancing a person's overall attractiveness.
</P>
<P>
   But, no, wearing flats more often because it's the new thing to
do doesn't automatically equate with looking shorter, thicker,
dowdier or less assertive. Designers wouldn't advocate flats if
they hadn't reconciled the shoes with the clothes first.
</P>
<P>
   The lower hemlines, drapey suits and calf-baring pants that are
reaching stores this spring all contribute to the illusion of an
elongated silhouette and compensate for the height advantage lost
when wearing flats instead of heels. Flats also look more in sync
with the coming season's most stylish looks once it's realized that
designers had comfort in the forefront of their minds when sitting
down at their drawing boards.
</P>
<P>
   The newest flat-soled styles have a mixture of balletic,
athletic and modernistic qualities, all of which contribute to a
look that's smart, youthful and ultrafeminine.
</P>
<P>
   Give flats _ and the clothes that look best with them _ a try
when reassembling your warm-weather wardrobe. Once it's evident
that wearing flats stylishly isn't as challenging as it sounds,
you'll be glad you did.

TEXANS OBJECT TO BILL THAT WOULD CLOSE MORE MILITARY BASES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SIG CHRISTENSON  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Several Texas lawmakers have denounced a new
Senate bill that calls for more rounds of military base closings in
2001 and 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is the third of its kind since the last round of
closings in 1995 and, like the others, faces bipartisan criticism
in states that are likely to lose military outposts. The
legislation was introduced Wednesday by Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz.;
Carl Levin, D-Mich.; and Charles Robb, D-Va.
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Ciro D. Rodriguez and Solomon P. Ortiz, both Democrats
from Texas, joined with Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas and
other Republicans in opposing the new legislation, yet they
conceded the bill would be tougher to defeat than in previous
years.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison, a member of Senate Appropriations Committee, said it
was premature to close more bases.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, said he ``would oppose any
legislation that threatens to reduce our readiness any more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point in time, I don't think it has a chance,'' said
Rodriguez, a member of the House National Security Committee.
``That might change 30 days from now.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain cited concern over the readiness of American forces when
he unveiled the bill. He said efforts to bolster preparedness and
modernize weapons systems would ``be in vain'' if the Defense
Department continues to spend money on unneeded bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we actually look for the dollars to pay for these
initiatives, it is unconscionable that some would not look to the
billions of dollars to be saved by base realignment and closure,''
McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Department spokesman Glenn Flood said closing bases in
1988, 1991, 1993 and 1995 has saved about $6.7 billion since 1996,
and is projected to save $25 billion through 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, last month reported ``substantial savings'' had resulted
from closing or consolidating bases.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation triggered concern here that Brooks Air Force
Base could end up on the list. In 1995, the Defense Base Closure
and Realignment Commission ordered another San Antonio facility,
Kelly Air Force Base, to close.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks _ where 4,405 workers earn an average of $42,070 per year
_ originally had been targeted for closure in 1995 but was spared
at the last minute. Many officials here consider the base
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have to be asleep for a long time not to expect something
like this,'' Mayor Howard Peak said. ``It has been talked about for
years and years and years, including recently.''
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department can't shut major bases without
congressional approval. A total of 97 bases, representing all the
military services, have been ordered closed since 1988, with all
but about 10 of them already shuttered.

 &HT;    A hideaway for all seasons: Regardless of the weather, Sandestin
resort endures as a favorite for travelers
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DESTIN, Fla. _ The Monday morning sun climbs high in a
picture-postcard blue sky, nudging the temperature toward 60
degrees as a gentle northerly wind puffs the 34-foot Spanish Moon
through the tranquil waters of Choctawhatchee Bay.
</P>
<P>
   At last. This is what we've been waiting for.
</P>
<P>
   We arrived at the sprawling Resort at Sandestin on Florida's
Panhandle under ominous skies on Friday afternoon. We shivered as
the mercury dropped through a gray, drizzly Saturday and awoke on
Sunday to blinding sunshine _ and temperatures in the 20s. (Did
those hardy souls who ventured out for a walk on the beach realize
the wind chill was _ brrrr _ 6 degrees?)
</P>
<P>
   Whoever came up with Sandestin's slogan, ``Come outside and
play,'' clearly did not count on days like these.
</P>
<P>
   But now, with happy-go-lucky Capt. Chuck Hudspeth at the wheel,
we're sailing away from Sandestin's Baytowne Marina toward the
Mid-Bay Bridge. Before long we start peeling off the layers of
clothing we'd piled on to keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   Just our luck. This is the day we head home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Sandestin,'' says the gregarious Hudspeth, 44, a former
Miami real estate broker who chucked the corporate world for the
laid-back life of a charter boat captain in 1981. ``This is my
sixth year here and nobody's mad at me. My boat likes it here. All
the time, there's something fun going on.''
</P>
<P>
   The second weekend in January, things are definitely low-key at
the gated 2,400-acre resort that straddles U.S. 98 eight miles west
of Destin, halfway between Panama City and Pensacola. But soon the
temperatures will moderate _ even in January, days in the 70s are
not uncommon _ and the crowds will return.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly two decades, Destin has been a magnet for vacationing
Atlantans. Regulars have watched the area mushroom: beach
high-rises, neon-flashing restaurants and strip shopping centers
rapidly filling in the gaps along much-traveled U.S. 98 and Old
Highway 98, the beach route.
</P>
<P>
   Originally a haven for deep-sea fishermen, Destin _ which bills
itself as ``The world's luckiest fishing village'' _ lures not only
anglers but families who bask in the sun on sugar-white beaches,
splash in the Gulf of Mexico's clear emerald waters and wait in
line for an hour or more to feast at tried-and-true seafood haunts
such as Harbor Docks.
</P>
<P>
   But not this weekend. The go-carts at the Track and Big Kahuna
roadside recreation centers are silent. An elephant standing guard
at one of the miniature golf courses looks downright forlorn. The
usually bustling docks along Destin Harbor are wind-whipped ghost
towns. No dolphin cruises, no WaveRunners, no parasailing. No proud
displays of the day's big fish that didn't get away.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the only place that is truly hopping is the Silver
Sands Factory Stores, where shoppers are not about to let a little
cold and rain keep them from the post-holiday clearance sales.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do the elements faze Everett Periman, a snowbird from
Nevada, Mo., who has escaped to Sandestin in the wintertime since
1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been golfing for 60 years,'' says Periman, 82, ``and my
last three rounds, I've scored my age or better.''
</P>
<P>
   Periman and his wife, Bertha, visit annually from December until
February, joined by several couples from the Kansas City area.
</P>
<P>
   He first drove through the region when he was at Ripley Air
Force Base in Mobile in 1949 _ back when U.S. 98 was ``a very
narrow blacktop with swamp and alligators.''
</P>
<P>
   Periman says they always stay in one of the six Sandestin
high-rises directly on the gulf. ``We like to walk on the beach.
And we love the golf, the seafood and the warmer weather. We like
the off-season. The restaurants aren't crowded. You can get a tee
time. We'll play a round of golf and not see another foursome.''
</P>
<P>
   We know how he feels. At times, it seems as if we have the place
all to ourselves _ our own private resort. No waits this time of
year. Want some court time to play that free daily hour of tennis
that comes with the room rate? No problem. Want to work out at the
health club? The treadmill is waiting. Need a massage? Lie down.
Want to schedule a fly-fishing lesson with resident expert Joy
Dunlop? Just sign up.
</P>
<P>
   Even with children's activities on hold and the recreational
programs scaled back, we found plenty to keep us entertained.
</P>
<P>
   My daughter and I spent a rainy Saturday morning at the salon
being pampered (nothing like a hot paraffin dip for rough hands and
feet to soothe dry winter skin). In the afternoon, while I checked
out the shops and galleries, she dabbled at Fired Up! Paint Your
Own Pottery Studio. Meanwhile, my husband did a little ``research''
of his own at the resort's Linkside Pub, a sports bar where he
quaffed dollar drafts and watched a certain football team do the
Dirty Bird on the big-screen TV.
</P>
<P>
   When it warmed into the 40s on Sunday afternoon, he managed to
get in 18 holes at the Rees Jones-designed Burnt Pine Golf Club _
one of the resort's three courses _ that was built around wetlands
without disturbing the environmentally sensitive area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at all the water,'' he said rather apprehensively,
showing me the card with drawings depicting the lay of each hole.
He returned telling tales of dimpled white balls sacrificed to the
marsh gods, who must be extremely pleased with all the offerings he
plopped into the drink.

   DESTIN, Fla.: into the drink.
</P>
<P>
   We headed west on U.S. 98 to the Silver Sands outlet center to
play at Morgan's Family Entertainment Center. The two-story complex
has dining on the lower level (wood-fired pizzas, rotisserie
chicken, grilled hamburgers and baked-on-the-premises cakes, pies,
breads and pastries) and a fantasy playland just up the escalator.
The theme is Jules Verne _ there's a huge hot air balloon (a la
``Around the World in 80 Days'') that floats to the rafters and
down again. Video games, motion simulation rides and arcade skill
games are contained in an ocean-floor-styled environment (a la
``20,000 Leagues Under the Sea''), complete with saltwater
aquariums. Beware: Children will want to jump ship and move in
permanently.
</P>
<P>
   It was too wet, then too windy for the canoeing and bicycling we
had looked forward to. (Well, several Joe Pro-looking cyclists in
skintight lycra suits didn't let the weather stop them.) But
Sandestin makes canoes (and kayaks) as well as sturdy cruisers
available at no additional charge to guests.
</P>
<P>
   Jolee Island, with its nature trails and pirate-themed playscape
accessible by a footbridge, was deserted but for a lone jogger. The
wonderful two-story Swiss Family Robinson-style treehouse _ hidden
in the Spanish moss-draped trees and dense vegetation in the
wetlands adjacent to the marina _ was all ours.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing we missed _ except for splashing in the
surf _ was dining at Sandestin's signature restaurant, Elephant
Walk, which was closed the first two weeks of the year. The
gulf-front restaurant with an East-meets-West menu is fashioned
after the India plantation owner's home in the 1954 Elizabeth
Taylor film of the same name.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sandestin in winter has its charms. Besides being
uncrowded, the rates for accommodations in the high-rise beach
condos, villas and bayview inn are signficantly lower than in the
summer _ a detail that was not lost on Tony Samra of Acworth.
</P>
<P>
   Samra visited here for the first time last summer with his wife,
Liz, and teenage daughter, Maggie. They were so impressed they made
plans to return with the extended family for a post-Christmas
getaway _ even though they knew it would be too chilly to enjoy the
Jet Skis they rented in July.
</P>
<P>
   They love the lush landscaping, the kick-back-and-relax
atmosphere and ``miles and miles of bike paths,'' including the
tunnel under busy U.S. 98 that provides access from beachside to
the golf and marina areas on the bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great place for a total family experience,'' says
Samra, a professor at Kennesaw State University. ``We had four
families (during the holiday visit) and there was something to make
everybody happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a Sandestin guest could easily while away the days and
nights without ever leaving the property _ and that's exactly what
new owner, Intrawest, has in mind. The Vancouver company doesn't
want its guests to be idle or, worse, be tempted to look elsewhere
for amusement. Its operating mantra is ``24 hours a day, seven days
a week, 365 days a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandestin is the mega-developer's first warm-weather
destination, joining such mountain resorts as Whist-
</P>
<P>
   ler/Blackcomb in British Columbia, Copper in Colorado, Stratton
in Vermont, Snowshoe in West Virginia and Mammoth in California.
</P>
<P>
   Intrawest has yet to unveil its master plan for Sandestin, which
it purchased for $130 million last summer, but an announcement is
expected by winter's end.
</P>
<P>
   The best clue so far to what's on the drawing board is
Intrawest's initial statement that it envisions a resort village at
Baytowne Marina similar to Harbortown at Hilton Head Island. And
there's another golf course in the works.
</P>
<P>
   Links regular Everett Periman says he's seen ``lots and lots of
changes'' at Sandestin over the years, and isn't surprised more
development is coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' he says, ``is the name of the game on the Emerald
Coast.''

 &HT;    Three faces of Destin
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DESTIN, Fla. _ Bringing the gourmet touch
</P>
<P>
   Kipp Bordeau, who spent the past seven years at the Cloisters on
Sea Island, is making culinary waves on the Destin dining scene
with inventive fare. Since August, he has been stirring things up
in the kitchen at Frangista Seafood and Spirits on Old U.S. 98.
</P>
<P>
   Bordeau's Blackened Salmon Oscar ($23) with fresh aparagus and
lump crabmeat is served over sweet potato gnocchi; and
Mediterranean Grouper ($19) is topped with sundried tomatoes, feta
cheese and olives. The rich velvety pink lobster bisque with
langostino ($6.25) is packed with flavor.
</P>
<P>
   He recently began offering nine-course ``chef degustation''
dinners by reservation in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just pull a few of my favorites out of the top hat,'' says
Bordeau, 29, gesturing to his starched white chef's toque. ``You
never know what to expect.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Saturday night, the Surgnier family from nearby
Marianna was finishing a three-hour meal at a table set up in the
kitchen, complete with ice sculpture and fresh flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was incredible,'' says Sally Surgnier. ``I felt like a
queen. So many courses just kept coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds husband Steve: ``We travel a lot and eat at a lot of
places, and this is the most fun we've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Information: 1820 Old U.S. 98, Destin. 850-837-2515.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime cottage industry
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to drive right past the Murmuring Surf, a cozy
enclave of 50-year-old cottages and newer two-story apartments
tucked among the rows of high rises along Old U.S. 98. When it
opened a half century ago, it stood alone _ the first beach cottage
court on a 100-mile stretch between Panama City and Pensacola.
</P>
<P>
   John Terry, 85, a decorated World War II naval commander,
adopted a build-it-and-they-will-come attitude when he began
constructing the cottages in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   He took a gamble that tourists would soon discover the remote
area of the Florida Panhandle when he moved from Memphis with his
wife, Emily, and young family. This venerable mom-and-pop business
has maintained a loyal following of guests who return year after
year for clean, simple accommodations with none of the amenities of
their towering neighbors. Not even a swimming pool. Guests must
brings their own soap and tissues.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days, wild hogs roamed the sand dunes, and the
Terrys had to shoo cows off the roadway. Undeveloped beaches
stretched for miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``See that brush over there,'' says Terry, pointing across busy
U.S. 98A. ``That was all there was in the world for umpteen
miles.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Terry doesn't disdain his fancy high-rise neighbors. ``I
think some of them are real pretty to look at,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   While progress has altered the face of Destin, not much has
changed at Murmuring Surf.
</P>
<P>
   When it opened, weekly rates were $50. Today, even in the high
season, the tariff for two is an affordable $495 weekly for
one-bedroom cottages and $585 for two-bedroom apartments (and
through May 1, make that $410 and $360). Add $20 per extra person
weekly. A $100 reservation deposit is required.
</P>
<P>
   And no charge cards, please.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Information: 551 Old U.S. 98, Destin. 850-837-6616.
</P>
<P>
   Serving up fresh seafood
</P>
<P>
   When Atlanta native Charles Morgan opened Harbor Docks in 1979,
it was just a weatherbeaten little cottage with six picnic tables.
Fishermen came in after a day on the gulf for oysters on the half
shell and cold beer.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two decades, Morgan, 44, has cobbled together a
rambling complex that includes an A-frame cedar bar and dining area
heated by a wood stove and several indoor and outdoor decks on
multilevels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just kept tacking on,'' says Morgan. ``We didn't know what
we were doing.''
</P>
<P>
   About eight years ago, he installed _ of all things _ a sushi
bar and hired an experienced sushi chef named Yoshi.
</P>
<P>
   But the place's unpretentious wood-shack ambience has remained,
with mounted fish and game on display and framed prints of
fishermen and their catches lining the walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``This area is known for fishing,'' Morgan says. ``Four or five
world records have been caught from these docks. The harbor is what
makes Destin special.''
</P>
<P>
   For a chance to dine overlooking the harbor, folks wait _
sometimes more than an hour in the summer _ to feast on heaping
plates of fresh seafood and catches of the day. The seafood platter
($20.95, fried or broiled) is one impressive pile of food (and
mighty good eating, too): shrimp, scallops, fish, soft shell crab
and a crab-stuffed shrimp wrapped in bacon. And we've never found
better crab cakes (go for the sampler of four mini cakes as an
appetizer, $8.95).
</P>
<P>
   Morgan wonders how a $71 million harbor redevelopment project in
the works will affect the sleepy-fishing-village character of East
Pass and the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be Hong Kong before long,'' he laments.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Information: Lunch 11 a.m.-4 p.m. and dinner 5-11 p.m. daily.

KEVIN BACON PUTS MUSICAL CAREER ON FRONT BURNER 
</HEADLINE>
 BACON-MUSIC-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KATHY CANO-MURILLO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Ham hocks, sausage, chorizo, tenderloins, spareribs
and pig's feet are six degrees of pork that actor Kevin Bacon
doesn't care to acknowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``My name is a curse,'' says the 40-year-old actor, calling from
his New York apartment. ``When I was a child, I actually had an
affliction because of my name. I'd look up at God and say, `Why me,
Lord?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pig connection, Bacon doesn't have much to squeal
about these days.
</P>
<P>
   He has appeared in more Hollywood movies than anyone cares to
list, shares a happy family with wife Kyra Sedgwick and is the
focus of the campy cult-classic game Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   But a lesser-known venture has caused fans to lend an ear. Bacon
and his big brother, Michael, have been performing original music
at venues across the country. Believe it or not, the ``Wild
Things'' star belts out an array of tunes in a James Taylor/John
Mellencamp style.
</P>
<P>
   Will mainstream audiences accept him as a singer?
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, many will be skeptical. Can you say Bruce Willis?
Steven Seagal? Don Johnson? Keanu Reeves?
</P>
<P>
   The Bacon Brothers are confident about their pet project. They
feel assured that listeners will get past the burnt residue left by
other actors-turned-musicians to be pleasantly surprised with their
debut CD, ``Forosoco.'' The name of the disc is an acronym for the
music they play: folk, rock, soul and country. And the record has
received decent reviews from critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of anxiety with this band,'' Bacon admits.
``There's always so much resistance to the idea of someone doing
something else than what the public is used to. They don't really
get the idea of an actor singing. We just try not to get too
wrapped up in all that.''
</P>
<P>
   As children, Kevin took the acting road, Michael the musical
one. Kevin remembers admiring his brother's flair for
instrumentation. He says he was awestruck when Michael invited him
to join in.
</P>
<P>
   Once Kevin learned how to play guitar and sing, it wasn't long
before the two were collaborating on material. In 1994, the Bacon
Brothers received an offer to headline at a Philadelphia club.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first we thought it wasn't such a good idea,'' Michael
says. ``I didn't think Kevin was ready and he didn't think so,
either. But we just said `what the hell' and put a band together
for that one night. At the end, we realized it really had a purpose
and decided to continue on with it.''
</P>
<P>
   But what came easily for Michael was sheer terror for Kevin.
Although he has portrayed everything from a dance-happy teen in
``Footloose'' to a perverted reform-center guard in ``Sleepers,''
he found breaking into song in front of a live audience somewhat
nerve-racking.
</P>
<P>
   His early gigs included bouts of a cracking voice, knocking
knees and nasty nausea. But he claims it was that kind of stage
fright that sent him back for more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stage fright is a good thing,'' Bacon says. ``It electrifies a
performer's creative life. It forces you to really step up to the
plate. I had lost that feeling while acting in the movies because
acting became so comfortable with me. I still get a little nervous
onstage singing, but I like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon is currently between movies and plans to spend the next
three months working full time on the band. The Bacon Brothers are
scheduled to perform at the Sundance Film Festival in Utah this
weekend after pit stop at Planet Hollywood in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Both openly admit that most of the crowd is there because of
Kevin's dimples and movie-star charisma, but that doesn't seem to
bother them. They know that guarantees them a full house almost
every time.
</P>
<P>
   And if you check out the show, keep in mind that there is a
reason they have dubbed this the ``No Food Jokes Tour.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it that hoping people will take the hint,'' Michael
Bacon says. ``But they never do, and there's nothing we can do
about that.'' &QL;

BAD GOLFERS ARE A DIVER'S BREAD AND BUTTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAUL DOMINGUEZ  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ A trail of bubbles rises from a lake at the Hyatt
Regency Hill Country Resort and rolls toward one of the golf
greens.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Helms surfaces, wearing 100 pounds of diving equipment and
carrying a bag with hundreds of golf balls.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a golfer with an embarrassingly bad handicap.
Rather, Helms is an entrepreneur who runs one of the more unusual
golfing businesses _ retrieving errant balls from lakes.
</P>
<P>
   After being laid off from an accounting job and nearly losing
his home, Helms says he found peace and success in his submerged
world. His family-run Underwater Golf Ball Recovery Co. has
serviced most courses in the San Antonio area since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The certified diver scours the murky depths every day for balls
plopped into lakes by errant shooters. He generally fills several
bags, which hold 600 balls, with each underwater excursion.
</P>
<P>
   He also regularly finds golf clubs. Some clubs slipped from
golfers' hands, but others were obviously discarded in frustration.
Helms once found a set of clubs spaced two feet apart at the bottom
of a lake as if someone had walked along the banks and slowly ended
his relationship with golf.
</P>
<P>
   Helms feels his way along the bottom and sides of the lakes
because the silt and dirt kicked up obscures his vision. Yet there
are times when the lake is as clear as a summer's morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``When water flows, it moves the dirt so that I can see,'' Helms
said. ``If I can see, it's like finding little Easter eggs along
the bottom. There's a lot of joy in it. Everything is just
convenient. They are all over the place. You can't grab them fast
enough. You don't have enough hands. It's fun.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a peaceful and profitable existence, although Helms would
not say how much he earns reselling the balls.
</P>
<P>
   There are 26.5 million golfers in America and only 22 percent
can break 90. That means millions are familiar with the sound of
balls splashing into the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most incredible thing to me is how many golf balls people
lose,'' said Dan Budzius, the director of golf at the Hyatt Hill
Country resort. ``It is truly fascinating the amount of balls he
pulls out of lakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the balls are sold back to the golf courses, but the
majority are sold to companies that then sell to retail stores such
as Wal-Mart or the overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
   While money is a factor, Helms said he retrieves balls because
he enjoys being in the water, loves being his own boss and revels
in the mental and physical benefits.
</P>
<P>
   It also has allowed him to relive the joys of his childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Helms grew up in Portsmouth, R.I., near the Montaup Country
Club. He would retrieve lost balls from a railroad track that
divided the nines.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a boy of 8 years old, I would go and dig balls out of the
bushes, trees and along the rough,'' he said. ``As kids, on the
11th fairway, we would yell out from our picnic table, `Do you want
to buy golf balls?'''
</P>
<P>
   Helms and his siblings also sold snacks and beverages, but golf
balls were the hottest sellers. He estimated earning several
hundred dollars every summer.
</P>
<P>
   As Helms grew older, his attention turned from the rough to the
water hazards at Montaup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always knew there were balls in the water,'' Helms said.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, Helms was searching for balls in the water. He even
convinced his girlfriend and future wife, Sue, to help him.
</P>
<P>
   ``On our dates, we would go out in the lakes,'' he said,
chuckling at the memory. ``We would get in that water at night with
the snakes, muskrats and other rodents.''
</P>
<P>
   Helms gave up retrieving balls, served a four-year term in the
Air Force and eventually became an accountant in San Antonio. When
he lost his job, he said it was ``like a boot in the rear end.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than returning to the stress and sedentary lifestyle or
accounting, he opted to do something he enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What have I ever done that could be fun?'' Helms said. ``What
have I not done but wanted to do? I always wanted to jump out an
airplane in a parachute and always wanted to dive. I looked at
myself and knew I always wanted to be in the water. I enjoyed it.''
</P>
<P>
   A family business was born.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Helms does the washing and sorting of the balls, and their
son, Michael, does the shipping.
</P>
<P>
   Diving for balls is peaceful, but it has its risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's quite a bit of danger that he can run into down under
there,'' Budzius said. ``You never know, you can get stuck under
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Helms has run into bridges, a golf cart, a dead deer and the
sharp spines of catfish underwater, but he never has been seriously
injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's dangerous,'' he said. ``No matter how well I
train, you're not prepared for the unknown.''

SHANGRI-LA DISCOVERY A HOAX? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK SHAFFER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - The press release shot around the world, worded in
reverential, almost breathless tones.
</P>
<P>
   Explorers from ``National Geographic'' magazine had discovered
the fabled Shangri-la, it announced, in a gorge of the world's
deepest canyon inside the Himalayas of Nepal.
</P>
<P>
   The team described a ``hidden'' 100-foot-high waterfall of
Sherpa myth and Western legend in a subtropical garden full of
unusual plants, trees and animals including a horned creature
sacred to Tibetan Buddhists called the (begin ital) takin. (end
ital)
</P>
<P>
   But there's one problem, claims Tucson, Ariz., explorer and tour
guide Richard Fisher: He's visited the site twice before _ and
knows of a dozen others who have.
</P>
<P>
   And he has pictures and video to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   If ``National Geographic'' explorers care to look around more,
Fisher added, they'll find three more waterfalls of the same size
within a few miles of the so-called ``Hidden Falls of the Tsangpo
River.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher's conclusion: ``The National Geographic Society has
signed off on a major geographical hoax.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rebecca Martin, director of the Society's Expeditions Board,
stands by her exploration team. It was led by Ian Baker, she said,
a Nepal resident who has written several books about Tibetan
culture and has been inside the Tsangpo gorge six times.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher said he took one expedition, which included Baker, in an
area near the waterfall in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``His (Fisher's) accusations against others are completely
unfounded,'' Martin said. ``According to Ian, Rick never went into
that area we are referring to and Ian is very well-versed with that
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Rick has the video and other evidence, we should all be
allowed to share in this.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin and other National Geographic officials said the
waterfall discovery came in a ``legendary, unexplored five-mile gap
in the Upper Tsangpo Gorge.``
</P>
<P>
   They said Baker and other members of the team descended a steep,
rugged slope then rappelled to the waterfalls 80 feet below,
arriving on the afternoon of Nov. 8, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Fisher said it's all part of the same canyon, which is
about 30 miles in length.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the things they have said about it are true,'' Fisher
said. ``It is a subtropical paradise with all kinds of life you
don't find outside that area. That area has the strongest monsoon
on Earth with even twice the rain of the Olympia Peninsula in
Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher said that a photograph he saw in support of the discovery
showed Baker standing in front of a river of clear water running at
about 5,000 cubic feet per second.
</P>
<P>
   ``In November 1998 the Tsangpo was running in excess of 25,000
cfs and was flood-stage muddy,'' Fisher wrote in a letter to
``National Geographic.'' ``It was about the size of the Ohio River
and raging muddy over dozens of waterfalls and rapids in excess of
30-foot drops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I question that they even made it near the narrows,'' Fisher
added.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time that Fisher and ``National
Geographic'' have been at odds.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the magazine referred to Peru's Colca Canyon as the
mother of all gorges at 1,052 meters from the lower rim to its
deepest point. But Fisher contended in press reports at the time
that the Peruvian canyon was actually dwarfed by Namjagbarwa
Canyon, where the Tsangpo Gorge is located, which is 5,909 meters
deep. &QL;

INTEL SECURITY TECHNOLOGY RAISES PRIVACY CONCERNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Intel Corp. plans a new technology, called
Common Data Security Architecture, to create a security standard
for Internet-based purchases and other electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   But privacy specialists are concerned about reports the that
computer chipmaker plans to include identification numbers in its
next generation of computer chips.
</P>
<P>
   According to the reports, a computer equipped with the new Intel
chips would pass on the embedded number during unspecified Internet
transactions, possibly allowing the owner of the computer to be
identified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we're concerned,'' said Ari Schwartz, an analyst
with the Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington, D.C.
``There are privacy ramifications with Intel's plans. Mostly we're
concerned with what's going to happen down the road with this
information.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz said Wednesday that his organization, along with the
American Civil Liberties Union, had been meeting with Intel
executives over the last two weeks to discuss the effects of the
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know we're concerned,'' Schwartz said. ``This has the
potential to add to the stockpile of private data that the Internet
companies are gathering on citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Two independent sources within Intel said the CDSA technology
would be deployed over the next couple of years to create a
security standard for Internet-based purchases and other electronic
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly haven't set out to destroy privacy,'' said one of
the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The Intel sources said the identifying numbers can be masked by
software supplied with the machines.

   &UR; FEATURES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   NY-WOJNAROWICZ (New York) _ David Wojnarowicz (1954-1992) was a
near-mythic figure in New York a decade ago, and for many people
who knew him, he still is. Artist, writer, filmmaker and performer,
he gained fame during the brief East Village art boom of the
1980's. But he kept himself outside the hype and went his own way.
He stayed in the neighborhood after the galleries had moved out,
and died there of AIDS at the age of 38. But at the moment he's
back in New York in full force. A retrospective titled ``Fever: The
Art of David Wojnarowicz'' has opened at the New Museum of
Contemporary Art in SoHo; several Manhattan galleries are showing
his work. A book of excerpts from his diaries has just appeared. By
Holland Cotter.
</P>
<P>
   BOOK-CLUBS (New York) _ Reading is an essentially solitary
activity, but talking about books requires at least two people.
Even if you live with another bibliovore, what are the chances that
you will both be struck by the desire to read and discuss, say,
``Bleak House'' or ``Ulysses'' at precisely the same moment? The
growing popularity of reading groups and book clubs attests to the
desire to talk about books as well as read them. By Bruce Shenitz.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ELGAR (Undated) _ Americans march to Elgar at commencements as
they march to Mendelssohn at weddings, but they probably don't
think about him most of the rest of the year. To a nation with
little patience for quaint remnants, he can seem an anomalous
holdover of the British Empire, which much of his music appeared to
embody in its doughty as in brave/valiant, or dowdy, as in
unstylish? staunchness and solemnity. But Elgar deserves respect
for more than just those ``Pomp and Circumstance'' marches; some
listeners have found a core of deep humanity in his work, even
under the occasional bluster. And now, for no reason apparent in
the stars, a confluence of events has brought the composer to
attention. By James R. Oestreich.

 By FLORA LEWIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;     (EDITORS: On Jan. 22 Flora Lewis will be honored in New York by
the OVERSEAS PRESS CLUB, with its coveted ``Lifetime Recognition
Award.'') 
 &HT;    NEW YORK _ It's so ``surreal'' some editors have ruled out
further use of the word as tiresomely banal. But nobody is
restraining the use of the word ``historic,'' and that is just what
it doesn't feel like. The sense of this epoch is really more an
outlandish farce or melodrama, exciting but of no essential
significance.
 &HT;    The president of the United States is charged with such grave
dishonor that he must be removed from office. At the same time,
that same president appears before both houses of Congress in
solemn assembly to tell them of his plans for the country, which
stretch as far as a half century ahead.
 &HT;    Of course, if President Bill Clinton is convicted of perjury and
obstruction of justice and expelled, it would be historic because
that has never happened before in the United States. But it seems
too far-fetched, considering the miserably pointless circumstances.
What's more, the partisan arithmetic seems too impervious to
argument _ enough Republican votes (a majority) in the House to
impeach and in the Senate to try, but not enough (two-thirds) to
convict.
 &HT;    Clinton's State of the Union address was glowingly upbeat, full
of confidence and promise. It focussed on the medium and long term,
five to 50 years ahead, with no reference at all to the immediate
attempt to cut him down. His lack of embarrassment, contrition or
malaise clearly infuriated his Republican opponents all the more.
 &HT;    The two young congressmen chosen to respond on TV for the
majority party, Jennifer Dunn of Washington and Steve Largent of
Oklahoma, had nothing to offer but their claims of personal virtue
and dedication, all delivered in overly familiar political
windbaggery.
 &HT;    When it comes to public issues, rather than his personal
misbehavior, Clinton doesn't provide them with much of a target,
while his easy, cheerful style, without a hint of discomfort, is
masterly.
 &HT;    Still, one of the two mysteries about the whole Clinton scandal
is why the hard-line right hates him so much. They do. They refer
to him as Evil Incarnate.
 &HT;    One analysis is that he has co-opted a lot of conservative
issues _ such as crime, middle-class problems with child care, poor
education standards _ and they feel he has stolen their birthright.
But that doesn't explain enough. After all, in a way it is a
repudiation of the left they abhor. There is also a rebound, a
revenge, against those who epitomized the counterculture rebellion
of the late 1960s and early 1970s, a kind of grim and satisfied
conviction that so much defiance could only come to a bad end.
 &HT;    The polls confirm the fact that the public at large doesn't
share the indignation at all. Why? _ that is the second mystery.
The questions that pollsters usually ask don't help much. The
answers tend to brush the surveys aside much more than to reveal
the underlying thoughts of either the hard-liners or the general
public.
 &HT;    The drama in the atmosphere all seems artificial, generated by
media and prosecutors, while the typical ordinary reaction is ``Oh,
leave him alone.''
 &HT;    Surprisingly, Dunn began her rebuttal to the president's speech
by saying it was wrong to talk so much about crisis. ``There isn't
any crisis, Americans are sound.'' But that's the president's first
point. ``The state of our union is strong,'' he said.
 &HT;    So what is the fuss about? Probably most congressional
Republicans are no more intense about it than their constituents,
but the militant leadership has achieved a capacity for
intimidation that keeps them from risking the charge of being
``soft'' or defecting.
 &HT;    The situation has been compared to the period of Sen. Joe
McCarthy's fierce campaign against the Communists he professed to
smell everywhere. It was enough to silence even Dwight Eisenhower.
 &HT;    But the McCarthy era, which finally blew up in ridicule, was
ABOUT something, an ideological crusade. It is very hard to say

 &HT;     (EDITORS: On Jan. 22 Flora Lewis will be honored in New York by
the OVERSEAS PRESS CLUB, with its coveted ``Lifetime Recognition
Award.'') 
 &HT;    NEW YORK _ It's so ``surreal'' some editors have ruled out
further use of the word as tiresomely banal. But nobody is
restraining the use of the word ``historic,'' and that is just what
it doesn't feel like. The sense of this epoch is really more an
outlandish farce or melodrama, exciting but of no essential
significance.
 &HT;    The president of the United States is charged with such grave
dishonor that he must be removed from office. At the same time,
that same president appears before both houses of Congress in
solemn assembly to tell them of his plans for the country, which
stretch as far as a half century ahead.
 &HT;    Of course, if President Bill Clinton is convicted of perjury and
obstruction of justice and expelled, it would be historic because
that has never happened before in the United States. But it seems
too far-fetched, considering the miserably pointless circumstances.
What's more, the partisan arithmetic seems too impervious to
argument _ enough Republican votes (a majority) in the House to
impeach and in the Senate to try, but not enough (two-thirds) to
convict.
 &HT;    Clinton's State of the Union address was glowingly upbeat, full
of confidence and promise. It focussed on the medium and long term,
five to 50 years ahead, with no reference at all to the immediate
attempt to cut him down. His lack of embarrassment, contrition or
malaise clearly infuriated his Republican opponents all the more.
 &HT;    The two young congressmen chosen to respond on TV for the
majority party, Jennifer Dunn of Washington and Steve Largent of
Oklahoma, had nothing to offer but their claims of personal virtue
and dedication, all delivered in overly familiar political
windbaggery.
 &HT;    When it comes to public issues, rather than his personal
misbehavior, Clinton doesn't provide them with much of a target,
while his easy, cheerful style, without a hint of discomfort, is
masterly.
 &HT;    Still, one of the two mysteries about the whole Clinton scandal
is why the hard-line right hates him so much. They do. They refer
to him as Evil Incarnate.
 &HT;    One analysis is that he has co-opted a lot of conservative
issues _ such as crime, middle-class problems with child care, poor
education standards _ and they feel he has stolen their birthright.
But that doesn't explain enough. After all, in a way it is a
repudiation of the left they abhor. There is also a rebound, a
revenge, against those who epitomized the counterculture rebellion
of the late 1960s and early 1970s, a kind of grim and satisfied
conviction that so much defiance could only come to a bad end.
 &HT;    The polls confirm the fact that the public at large doesn't
share the indignation at all. Why? _ that is the second mystery.
The questions that pollsters usually ask don't help much. The
answers tend to brush the surveys aside much more than to reveal
the underlying thoughts of either the hard-liners or the general
public.
 &HT;    The drama in the atmosphere all seems artificial, generated by
media and prosecutors, while the typical ordinary reaction is ``Oh,
leave him alone.''
 &HT;    Surprisingly, Dunn began her rebuttal to the president's speech
by saying it was wrong to talk so much about crisis. ``There isn't
any crisis, Americans are sound.'' But that's the president's first
point. ``The state of our union is strong,'' he said.
 &HT;    So what is the fuss about? Probably most congressional
Republicans are no more intense about it than their constituents,
but the militant leadership has achieved a capacity for
intimidation that keeps them from risking the charge of being
``soft'' or defecting.
 &HT;    The situation has been compared to the period of Sen. Joe
McCarthy's fierce campaign against the Communists he professed to
smell everywhere. It was enough to silence even Dwight Eisenhower.
 &HT;    But the McCarthy era, which finally blew up in ridicule, was
ABOUT something, an ideological crusade. It is very hard to say
what the Monica Lewinsky scandal is about, except by sniggering.
Still, it has taken on a momentum of its own that makes the next
weeks hard to predict.
 &HT;    The longer term is easier. As Clinton said in his speech, it has
to be about Social Security, education and public debt, and nothing
that is argued in his trial will make any real difference. It was
noticeable that he dwelt almost entirely on domestic social issues,
with only a brief passing reference to foreign affairs and
America's role in the world.
 &HT;    He was defending himself naturally, but he was also reflecting
what is predominantly on the mind of Americans as the country
enters the new century. Just getting on with life, nothing for the
rest of the world to get upset about.

 By JACOB WEISBERG  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    As a 10-year-old glued to the TV through the summer of
Watergate, I remember the air of gravity that hung over the
proceedings, the sense that it was a dreadful necessity to put a
president on trial.
 &HT;    I don't recall authority figures having to explain that it was a
national crisis _ even to a kid, that was pretty obvious.
 &HT;    And yet, one of the oddest things about the impeachment weekend
just before Christmas was the constant stream of reminders that
America again was again experiencing such a crisis. Legislators and
commentators kept trying to find more dramatic ways to frame the
events taking place.
 &HT;    Bill Clinton, they intoned, was about to become only the SECOND
president ever impeached. He would be our FIRST ELECTED president
ever impeached. All through the holidays and on into January the
tone remained the same: We were having the first Senate trial of a
president in 130 YEARS.
 &HT;    Watching TV was like having someone grab you by the lapels and
shout, Don't you understand this is supposed to be historic!
 &HT;    Clinton's impeachment is historic in the sense of it being an
event historians will puzzle over in decades to come. But what
those historians will have to ponder is not how it shook the
country, but why it didn't. They will have to explain how the
country experienced the form of a constitutional crisis without the
content of one, how an impeachment could drive a president's
approval rating up instead of down.
 &HT;    They may be better disposed than contemporary observers of the
Clinton scandal to look beyond the Dow Jones industrial average for
an explanation. For Clinton's weathering of the Lewinsky scandal
represents something that is truly historic _ a break in the way
the American presidency functions.
 &HT;    For the 60 years or so that preceded Clinton's election in 1992,
the nation lived through what might be described as the heroic
phase of the American presidency. Not that all modern presidents
have been heroes, of course. But beginning in the late 1920s, the
country was enveloped in a succession of crises _ the Great
Depression, World War II and the Cold War. We measured our
presidents against their roles in these great events.
 &HT;    Thankfully, we're now living in different times. The nation is
at peace and growing more prosperous, not merely or even mostly as
a consequence of executive decision-making, but as a backdrop to
it. This places a different and in some ways more difficult burden
on the leader of the free world.
 &HT;    An American president now has a more diffuse and bewildering
job. He must focus on a series of comparatively minor problems at
home, make sense of international confusion and compete for the
public's attention with more captivating forms of entertainment.
 &HT;    Clinton has not failed to keep his public entertained. To some
it has seemed like a tragedy, to others a sitcom. Following the
pattern of his career in Arkansas and of his accident-prone 1992
campaign, Clinton as president has repeatedly toyed with ruin,
practically digging his own grave, only to pop back up,
Houdini-like, after everyone thought he could no longer be
breathing.
 &HT;    With his impeachment on charges of perjury and obstruction of
justice, his dialogue with disaster has reached what is likely to
be its final phase (though another eruption is always possible).
 &HT;    The debate is no longer over Clinton's continued viability as a
politician, because he faces no more elections. The stain of
impeachment cannot be washed away by what he does in his remaining
time in the White House, because part of what his impeachment means
is that the House of Representatives is no longer much interested
in doing business with him.
 &HT;    A conviction in a Senate trial would make Clinton history sooner
rather than later, but whether he is convicted, acquitted or
censured as a result of some Senate-White House deal, it does not
seem too soon to try to characterize his presidency. Clinton is the
president who, for better and worse, turned the White House into a
governor's mansion.
 &HT;    Clinton was worried about his legacy long before he learned, a
year ago, that the world was about to learn about Monica Lewinsky.
In his book, ``Behind the Oval Office,'' Dick Morris described a
Sunday-morning phone conversation in August 1996 on the topic of
how Clinton would rate in the history books.
 &HT;    Clinton agreed he wasn't a top-tier president, but wondered what
he could do to make it into the ranks of Morris' second tier, with
Harry Truman, Theodore Roosevelt, Andrew Jackson and Ronald Reagan.
(Morris said he'd have to do three big things: make welfare reform
work, balance the federal budget and smash international terrorism,
on top of some littler things.)
 &HT;    Though the word ``legacy'' has a positive cast, presidential
historians often use it to convey a more neutral meaning. A legacy
is properly understood as a mark left on the country for good or
for ill. Popular democracy is Andrew Jackson's legacy. The national
park system is part of Theodore Roosevelt's. The New Deal, which
molded the modern federal government, is FDR's. Watergate is
Nixon's.
 &HT;    There are legacies of neglect, such as Ronald Reagan's bequest
to his successors of a vast federal budget deficit (offset by his
affirmative legacy of drawing the cold war to a surprising and
successful close). Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and George Bush, to
name three of our last five presidents, arguably left no major
legacy at all. The same is true of the late-19th-century presidents
who populate the murk between Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt.
 &HT;    We know something else about presidential legacies. Matters that
loom large now will diminish in retrospect. Clinton's popularity,
and by extension his survival as president, do rely heavily on the
extraordinary strength of the economy, now in the eighth year of
what will soon become our longest known peacetime expansion. But
over time, even that impressive statistic is likely to fade in
importance.
 &HT;    A lousy economy can define a presidency, as it did for Herbert
Hoover. But the simple fact of a good economy tends not to make a
legacy. If it did, Eisenhower, Johnson and Nixon would be
considered greater presidents than FDR and Truman.
 &HT;    There is already a rough consensus among historians that Clinton
is a significant president. He stands to be remembered, most
obviously, for causing a big scandal and getting impeached, but
also for getting re-elected, something no Democrat since FDR had
done.
 &HT;    But Clinton, I think, will also be remembered for reforming the
federal government and for reshaping his party. Most strikingly,
Clinton, like Andrew Jackson and FDR, has changed the very nature
of the American presidency. Where those two presidents expanded the
role and importance of the presidency, Clinton has downsized the
office, both in the negative sense of stripping away some of its
dignity and in the positive one of making adjustments demanded by
the historical moment.
 &HT;    Coming to the White House from the governor's mansion in Little
Rock, Clinton has recast the presidency on the more modest model of
his previous job. Unlike presidents, governors have few
opportunities to be visionaries. Instead, they do what Clinton has
done _ a job of crisis management, political accommodation and
governmental reform.
 &HT;    In one way, the public doesn't expect much from a governor; in
another way it expects a great deal. A governor is expected to
address whatever issues arise, from upgrading the skills of his
state's work force to reducing traffic congestion on its highways.
 &HT;    Financial constraints deny governors the possibility of grander
schemes. Within the confines of balanced and limited budgets,
however, they can distinguish themselves with creative
social-policy ideas. In smaller states, the governor is a familiar
figure whose blunders and foibles are as well known as his cartoon
caricature.
 &HT;    If the governor proves himself intelligent and capable, people
tend to be willing to indulge a fair amount of rascality on his
part. As flawed as he may be, he's all that protects them from a
Legislature that's inevitably far worse than he is.
 &HT;    Governors, of course, don't shape foreign policy. There's no
doubt Clinton will be remembered as primarily a domestic president
and perhaps the first in a line of domestic presidents who followed
the Cold War.
 &HT;    Clinton ran on domestic and economic issues in 1992, in answer
to George Bush's international focus. His platform, ``Putting
People First,'' the most detailed policy statement ever issued by a
candidate, elaborated a series of ideas about how to make
government more effective.
 &HT;    Clinton has improved a range of federal agencies and programs.
But what may stand as most significant is not just that he mended
broken policies, but that in fact he managed to restore the feeling
among Americans that domestic government works.

 &HT;    
 By JACOB WEISBERG  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    From his first presidential campaign, Bill Clinton was guided by
a revised philosophy of government's role.
 &HT;    Perhaps one of the most underappreciated things Clinton did
during his first year in office was expanding the Earned Income Tax
Credit, a program by which the federal government supplements the
income of low-wage workers.
 &HT;    Clinton's notion was that if you work full time, you shouldn't
have an income below the poverty line. A government commitment to
this principle exemplified his reform liberalism. As a successor to
the New Deal-Great Society archetype of ever-expanding social
benefits, Clinton proposed a more modest, reciprocal model, one
based on what he has described as an exchange of opportunity for
responsibility, and hence a model based on more limited
expectations of what the federal government can do.
 &HT;    During his 1992 campaign, Clinton characterized this notion, in
a phrase coined by Will Marshall of the Progressive Policy
Institute, as the ``New Covenant.'' Clinton's subsequent successes,
such as national service and welfare reform, have come from
applying this notion of a limited social contract.
 &HT;    His early failures occurred when he strayed from it, relapsing
into the older pattern of delivering new federal benefits from on
high. Most notable was his failure in health care.
 &HT;    It's possible that a better-designed and more politically astute
plan could have placed his presidency on stronger footing. But
Clinton botched the design and marketing of his plan, setting
himself at odds with moderates in both parties whose support he
needed.
 &HT;    Considering himself a centrist reformer, Clinton didn't see the
potential for his ``managed competition'' scheme to be portrayed as
an oldfangled liberal spending program.
 &HT;    What Clinton didn't yet get was the depth of the discontent with
the way government was working. When he took office, trust in
government had been steadily eroding for a quarter century. In
1964, 76 percent of Americans told pollsters they thought they
could trust government to do the right thing all or most of the
time. In 1994, the year Clinton's plan for health-care reform
fizzled, the number who said they trusted government bottomed out
at 15 percent.
 &HT;    The nature of this disillusion is a debate of its own, but it
was based at least in part on the failures of government in welfare
and public housing, in worsening crime and deteriorating public
education.
 &HT;    This loss of confidence easily attached itself to Clinton's
attempt to award the federal government another vast
responsibility. Clinton was regarded as someone who had promised
change and failed to deliver. This frustration came to fruition in
1994.
 &HT;    Not until the ascendancy of the Gingrich Congress did Clinton
fully grasp the depth of disenchantment with Washington. But from
that point on, Clinton began to understand that he had to grapple
with this corrosive skepticism.
 &HT;    Michael Waldman, Clinton's chief speech writer, remembers
sitting with him in the White House residence working on last
year's State of the Union address. At one point, according to
Waldman, Clinton paused and remarked that ``FDR's mission was to
save capitalism from its excesses. Our mission has been to save
government from its own excesses so it can again be a progressive
force.''
 &HT;    The idea of Clinton as the savior of liberal government will
strike many as perverse. Following the 1994 election, Clinton faced
tremendous criticism, not just from Republicans but also from
Democrats who felt he was trying to jettison, inan effort at
conciliation, the party's bedrock beliefs.
 &HT;    The lightning rod for this anger became his nefarious political
consultant Dick Morris, whom Democratic traditionalists saw as
pulling Clinton not in the direction of reform, but toward a dead
centrism derived from opinion polls. Clinton was much ridiculed for
proposing microinterventions like free walkie-talkies for
neighborhood watch groups.
 &HT;    But what Clinton was beginning to understand was that
government's failures weren't arcane managerial issues; they were
questions of public trust. While devising gubernatorial-scale
programs that encapsulated his New Covenant approach, he proceeded
to address the two biggest causes of that mistrust.
 &HT;    First, Clinton agreed to the Republican goal of a balanced
budget. But where the GOP long supported a balanced budget as a
means of downsizing government, Clinton saw it as a way to
reinvigorate government. From his first economic plan in 1993,
Clinton regarded the deficit as a problem serious enough to warrant
putting many of his pet projects on hold.
 &HT;    What he subsequently discovered was that by operating within the
context of a balanced budget, he could argue for expanding spending
in certain areas, like school construction or national service,
without being accused of fiscal irresponsibility. The federal
budget had become like a state budget. Only if government was
convincingly limited in size could it hope to get away with
activism.
 &HT;    His second and arguably more important decision was following
through on his campaign promise to end welfare ``as we know it.''
Many liberals mistook Clinton's interest in the subject as
political; they saw the subtext as race baiting. In fact, Clinton
saw welfare as disruptive of the proper relationship between
government and its citizens. The system's unpopularity was not just
because of its being counterproductive or a waste of resources, but
because it offered something for nothing.
 &HT;    Members of Clinton's cabinet objected strenuously to his
decision to accept a modified Republican bill based on the idea of
block grants, and a few of his own policy makers resigned in
protest over the issue. The smoke of battle obscured the fact that
Clinton was following through on his New Covenant notion of welfare
reform and not merely acceding to a punitive rollback.
 &HT;    Clinton could also see that the country's governors, already
embarked on a variety of welfare-reform experiments, were in the
best position to know how the system might be fixed. Only in the
last year has it become evident that Clinton did reform welfare
largely in the way he said he would with pretty much the results he
anticipated.
 &HT;    Welfare rolls have declined from 5 million families in 1995 to 3
million in June 1998. A downturn in the economy could curtail this
progress by making it harder to place people in jobs, but at the
moment the national picture is one of drastically declining levels
of dependency with scant evidence of increased misery.
 &HT;    These promising signs have been accompanied by progress in other
areas in which government has failed. Under Henry Cisneros, the
Department of Housing and Urban Development actually began breaking
up pockets of concentrated poverty by tearing down parts of the
worst urban housing projects and moving to voucher-based subsidies.
 &HT;    Cities have also benefited from two changes that may have been
largely incidental to Clinton's agenda _ a big drop in crime and
the end of a long-term increase in out-of-wedlock births. Together
these developments have begun to have a tipping-point effect for
America's urban centers.
 &HT;    It's too early to say that these improvements have restored the
30-year slide in faith in government. But from its low in 1994,
confidence in government had recovered more than 20 points by early
1998. Impeachment has driven it down a bit _ but to nowhere near
its lowest level.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Before Bill Clinton was elected in 1992, conventional wisdom
held that the Democrats faced a crisis. After 12 years of GOP White
House rule and defeat in five of the previous six presidential
elections, the party had seemingly ceased to become competitive at
the presidential level.
 &HT;    Peter Brown's 1991 book, ``Minority Party: Why Democrats Face
Defeat in 1992 and Beyond,'' was one of several arguing the thesis.
White working-class and suburban middle-class voters, according to
the conventional wisdom, were abandoning the party in droves
because of its excessively liberal positions on crime, welfare,
foreign policy and ``values'' issues.
 &HT;    How could the Democrats become politically competitive again in
an era when what the party once stood for _ an expanding federal
role _ was proving less and less popular? The party itself was
deeply divided over how and whether it should evolve.
 &HT;    On one side was a group of centrist reformers clustered around
the Democratic Leadership Council. On the other was a rump of
liberal traditionalists, including labor unions and minority groups
who viewed DLC positions as treasonable to their basic beliefs.
 &HT;    Clinton has faced the problems of his party _ at least at the
presidential level _ methodically, systematically and effectively.
To a remarkable degree, he has succeeded in making once seemingly
incurable ailments vanish, while giving back to the Democrats the
kind of well-oiled national political machine they had before 1968.
 &HT;    His first task was pulling thorns from the party paw. Asked
which party did a better job handling crime, voters chose the GOP
by a margin of 18 points in 1991.
 &HT;    Clinton reversed this pattern by jettisoning Dukakis-era
positions such as opposition to the death penalty while exploiting
the one aspect of the issue where public opinion diverges from the
dictates of GOP interest-group politics: gun control.
 &HT;    Clinton doesn't have much of a basis for claiming that it's his
policies that have reduced crime rates over the past several years,
but he has put away the charge that Democrats don't like punishing
criminals. Recent surveys show the parties polling essentially even
on the issue.
 &HT;    What's most remarkable is not that Clinton has taken crime and
other reliable wedge issues away from Republicans. It's that he has
done so while unifying a party that was itself divided over these
issues. In 1992, both the New Democrats and the traditionalists
supported Clinton in the belief that he was, at heart, one of them.
 &HT;    Perhaps inevitably, both sides were disappointed in the way he
governed. For much of his first term Clinton was out of favor with
the center or the left of his party, or both at the same time.
 &HT;    In his first two years, the DLC saw Clinton as swinging left
with his health-care plan and tax increase. In his second two
years, liberals griped over Clinton's accession to a balanced
budget and welfare reform. But by the time of the 1996 election,
Clinton had again forged an alliance.
 &HT;    Many people are puzzled about how Clinton has been able to
appease liberal constituencies while flouting their principles _
confronting unions with Nafta, poor blacks with welfare reform,
teachers with charter schools and feminists with Paula Jones.
 &HT;    The simplest explanation is that he has restored a model last
seen among Democrats during the presidency of Lyndon Johnson, when
those joining his coalition got to experience victory and taste
power. Clinton has created a sense of partisan pride powerful
enough to quell the narcissism of small differences.
 &HT;    This thrill of putting up a good fight against a common enemy _
something presidents as different as Ronald Reagan and Franklin
Roosevelt once created and used _ has overcome ideological and
sometimes moral scruples. Democratic activists have taken the
advice Clinton gave a group of them in 1981: ``When someone is
beating you over the head with a hammer ... take out a meat cleaver
and cut off their hand.''
 &HT;    It hasn't always been pretty, or even, perhaps, ethical. Since
1992, Clinton's style has been to dispense with qualms and play
politics in as ruthless and relentless a way as the GOP. In the
1980s, Reagan and George Bush were charged with relying on polling
to an unprecedented degree. Clinton has gone them one better,
market-testing his rhetoric, then deploying it with a numbing
repetitive precision.
 &HT;    He answered the slick fabrications of Michael Deaver with the
more subtle and compelling mythography of Harry Thomason and Linda
Bloodworth-Thomason. He dug deeper for dirt on his opponents,
devised more effective 30-second attack ads and showed great
ingenuity in exploiting loopholes in the campaign finance law.
 &HT;    The biggest change is financial. In the 1980s, the GOP advantage
in fund-raising was as high as 5 to 1. In the 1992 election cycle,
Clinton and Ron Brown, then chairman of the Democratic National
Committee, whittled it down to 3 to 2. In 1996, Clinton and Harold
Ickes nearly caught up in the chief corporate category, so-called
soft money, bringing in $123 million to the GOP's $138 million.
 &HT;    They did this with willful blindness about the sources of these
funds. Clinton's attitude is that because the rules aren't enforced
and Republicans are preventing him from creating a level playing
field, he is free to fight as dirty as they do.
 &HT;    Since the Lewinsky scandal, various sectors of the ideologically
disgruntled Democratic ``base'' _ those who might be thought to be
less than keen about Clinton's small-bore, poll-driven,
corporate-friendly centrism _ have been the president's staunchest
supporters.
 &HT;    Black leaders disappointed with Clinton over matters ranging
from the balanced budget to welfare reform have flocked to his
defense. Among blacks, Clinton's approval rating remains as high as
Ronald Reagan's rating was among conservative Republicans.
 &HT;    This is a testament in part to the real feeling Clinton evinces
over racial issues, as well as to black sensitivity to
prosecutorial unfairness and sympathy for victims of persecution.
But it also speaks to a different kind of party, one in which
members are willing to settle for half a loaf.
 &HT;    Republicans, on the other hand, now face the problem of a
radical base that has lost its willingness to postpone
gratification. The adage that Democrats look for heretics while
Republicans seek converts has ceased to apply.
 &HT;    To a remarkable degree, the parties have switched places.
Clinton's political formula is now almost universally regarded as a
winning one for Democrats. All of the serious contenders for the
2000 Democratic nomination have indicated their desire to continue
in the same basic direction.
 &HT;    Al Gore, Bill Bradley and John Kerry have all positioned
themselves as Clinton Democrats. The potential contenders who do
not fit this profile _ Paul Wellstone and Jesse Jackson _ are
running as protest candidates. Clinton's ``Third Way'' formula has
an international following as well. From a historical viewpoint,
the question is whether a Democratic successor will be able to
carry off Clinton's balancing act within the party.
 &HT;    There is a worrisome analogy in the GOP, where Reagan became a
successful two-term president by appeasing the religious right
while reaching out to moderate voters. Bush's efforts to sustain
this equilibrium made the Republican right truculent to the point
of self-destructiveness. Today the GOP remains badly divided,
looking back to the Reagan years as an irretrievable golden age.
 &HT;    Clinton's successor, almost certain to lack his political gifts
and perhaps his ruthlessness, faces an enormous challenge in
maintaining the Clinton coalition.

 &HT;    
 By JACOB WEISBERG  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Even if President Bill Clinton is not convicted by the U.S.
Senate and does finish his second term, impeachment will still be
in the first paragraph of his obituary.
 &HT;    At some level, Clinton can't escape becoming a historical joke.
 &HT;    He is now and forever our priapic president, who takes his place
alongside our drunken president, Ulysses S. Grant, our napping
president, Calvin Coolidge, and our treacherous president, Richard
Nixon.
 &HT;    Whatever else he does in office, Clinton will not be able to
keep this out of his capsule biography: He's the one who had oral
sex with a 21-year-old intern in the Oval Office, got caught, lied,
caused a national spectacle and saw it undermine his second term.
This story line may be tempered with sympathy.
 &HT;    In a longer view, Clinton's libido may not differentiate him
from Franklin Roosevelt (who died with his mistress, not his wife)
or John Kennedy (who arranged orgies in the White House swimming
pool). But it will be hard to avoid the view that there was
something more reckless about Clinton, because he had no basis for
thinking the press would protect him, as it did his predecessors.
 &HT;    Nor can Clinton escape his reputation for being slippery. He is
not the first president to lie, or lie under oath. But he will
surely be remembered as someone who habitually played games with
the truth.
 &HT;    Clinton is the president who said he never inhaled, who told a
national audience, ``I did not have sexual relations with that
woman'' _ and considered it true because his definition of sexual
relations did not include receiving oral sex.
 &HT;    The most evasive of these lines, such as ``It depends on what
the meaning of the word 'is' is,'' are destined for inclusion in
Bartlett's. Clinton is to hairsplitting legalisms what Yogi Berra
is to tautological absurdities; he seems nearly to have invented
the form.
 &HT;    It will also be recalled that he was disloyal to friends and
took advantage of people who worked for him. Early in his
presidency, Clinton failed to stand by nominees in trouble, even
when they were old friends like Zoe Baird. He has taken advantage
of faithful aides, using and disposing of them when convenient, as
with Harold Ickes, whom Clinton threw overboard after Ickes
finished the dirty work involved in getting him re-elected.
 &HT;    His sexual incontinence was itself a betrayal of people who
spent years working for him, some of whom faced their own legal
problems because they helped protect him. He led subordinates like
his former press secretary Michael McCurry to damage their own
professional reputations by amplifying his lies. Clinton will be
remembered as, among other things, a cad.
 &HT;    But more significant than what the impeachment episode says
about Clinton's character may be what it tells us about national
mores at century's end. Contrary to the prediction of many
reporters, myself included, the scandal not only did not end his
presidency; it actually made a president re-elected on a ``values''
agenda more popular.
 &HT;    When the scandal first broke a year ago, Washington reporters
were still dealing with the issue of whether to protect the public
from information they assumed it was too unsophisticated to handle.
Few suspected how much the rest of the country had changed in the
previous decade. The America of today is no longer the America of
1987, the year that Gary Hart was driven from a presidential race
by the Donna Rice scandal and that Clinton decided not to go for
the nomination after his aide Betsey Wright presented him with a
list of ex-lovers capable of sabotaging his candidacy.
 &HT;    Clinton is not simply the beneficiary of the arrival of a more
tolerant moral standard; he is personally responsible for its
application to politics. He was the first presidential candidate to
publicly acknowledge that he had committed adultery. Some have
argued that, based on the famous ``60 Minutes'' appearance, in
which he acknowledged causing pain in his marriage, there was an
implicit bargain between Clinton and the voters. If we elected him,
he promised to sin no more.
 &HT;    But the real proposition was direct and explicit: Clinton stood
for office on the basis of what he could do rather than who he
would be. Unlike previous presidents, he proposed to be hired on
the basis of his abilities and his approach to government, not his
qualities as a moral exemplar. He was promising to be a good
governor.
 &HT;    Such a promise is built into Clinton's own view of government.
His notion of a ``New Covenant'' implies a transformation in
expectations. Washington no longer delivers solutions to our
problems; it merely helps us to solve them. Not looking to
government as an all-purpose savior implies no longer putting
politicians on a pedestal.
 &HT;    To perform their new role, leaders don't have to be ideal human
beings, superior projections of ourselves. They merely need to
understand our problems and help us grapple with them. If they hold
up their end of the bargain, by governing well, we won't go beyond
ours by judging them harshly for inevitable human failings. While
he has surely tested our commitment to this pact, Clinton has held
up his end of it.
 &HT;    The compact that Clinton embodies has emerged as our country's
de facto standard of political morality. We are still less
dismissive of marital infidelity than, say, the French. But like
the Europeans and Canadians, we now distinguish public from private
in the lives of our leaders, and forbear from judgments about the
latter.
 &HT;    The new rules have not taken hold everywhere yet. Much of the
press has yet to assimilate the concept that most of the public no
longer considers intrusive reporting about private lives relevant
to democratic decision-making. Nonetheless, a president with a rare
ability to compartmentalize his psyche has ratified a new attitude
toward the private lives of public figures.
 &HT;    You can go further than that and say that the Lewinsky scandal
says something not just about the development of American political
morality, but also about American morality in general. A quick
survey might leave one with the impression that the 199os were the
decade that Puritanism died.
 &HT;    Since Clinton has been president, homosexuality has gained
public acceptance; legal gambling has swept the country;
pornography has become ubiquitous; and vice has been redefined as
disease. Meanwhile, the public has become unshockable about sex and
unconcerned about presidential adultery. These changes imply that
traditional morality has receded.
 &HT;    But something more complicated is going on. The same public that
has forgiven Clinton his trespasses holds to a strict personal
morality and has endorsed Clinton's emphasis on ``values'' in
government programs - what Prof. Michael Sandel of Harvard calls
Clinton's repudiation of ``moral neutrality'' in public policy.
 &HT;    The harmonization of these seeming contradictions may be arising
from the increasingly subtle distinction Americans are making
between the public and private realms. One striking thing the
sociologist Alan Wolfe shows in his book ``One Nation, After All''
is that while American suburbanites are far from relativistic in
their own moral views, they shrink from judging the private
behavior of others, and dislike moralizing when they see it
practiced. At the same time, they want government policy to support
their values.
 &HT;    The Lewinsky scandal writes these distinctions large. Few
approve of Clinton's behavior. Yet the vast majority object even
more to casting stones at the president for mistakes in an area
where he is answerable to his family and his God, not to voters or
the media. Though these mistakes may make it impossible for Clinton
to talk about values any longer, voters care more about how he
applied his views in public - welfare reform, for example - than
how he violated them in private.
 &HT;    Clinton didn't devise this ethic, but his election and survival
encapsulate it. He leaves behind an electorate that wants its
values embedded in public policy, but that no longer moralizes
about private behavior.

 &HT;    
 By JACOB WEISBERG  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The most common explanation for the animosity against President
Bill Clinton is that it is an expression of ``a culture war.''
 &HT;    In their strenuous dislike of the president, the idea goes,
conservatives are fighting a battle over the 1960s and its legacy.
Clinton is the first baby-boomer president, the first who dodged
the Vietnam draft and admitted to smoking marijuana.
 &HT;    His conservative opponents, including many members of the same
generation, see such a figure as a threat to the moral order.
During the impeachment fight, Tom DeLay, the House Republican whip,
described it as ``a debate about relativism vs. absolute truth.''
 &HT;    But the culture-war argument doesn't do justice to an antipathy
that goes back to Clinton's candidacy. I think there are three
separate psychological profiles of Clinton-hating, which have
blurred together at times.
 &HT;    _ The first type of Clinton-hater is liberal, and he does derive
his hatred from the 60s.
 &HT;    His is the view that Clinton is a fundamentally disingenuous and
inauthentic person who uses public interest as a cover for private
ambition. This opinion, which is manifest in much of Clinton's
press coverage, does not draw a line between the personal and the
political. The problem isn't that Clinton committed adultery or
that he lied about adultery.
 &HT;    Indeed, these lapses have inclined liberal critics to support
him. What they object to is that Clinton cares about winning more
than he cares about principles; that he has thrown overboard such
worthy causes as civil liberties, intervention in Bosnia, human
rights in China and campaign finance reform.
 &HT;    _ A second kind of hostility to Clinton is neither liberal nor
conservative but comes from the Washington establishment. Sally
Quinn, the journalist and Washington hostess, has written that the
Clintons ``dissed'' Georgetown society by neglecting its advice and
avoiding its company.
 &HT;    This is true, but the falling out goes well beyond a mere social
snub. By downsizing the presidency and ushering in an era of a less
ambitious federal government, Clinton has made Washington and its
establishment less important. By turning away from both foreign
affairs and big-ticket domestic programs, Clinton has made
Washington less central to the concerns of the nation than it was
in the days of SALT treaties.
 &HT;    Turning the presidency into the country's biggest governor's job
is contrary to the political establishment's sense of the office
and their relation to it. By allowing the Lewinsky scandal to
happen, Clinton has turned the American presidency (and by
extension those who feed off it) into an international
laughingstock.
 &HT;    ``Clinton acted ... as if he does not recognize what it means to
be president of the United States,'' wrote David Broder, a
Washington Post columnist, after Clinton's first nationally
televised mea culpa.
 &HT;    _ The third and most potent kind of Clinton-hating is
conservative, but is related to the liberal kind in its aversion to
a Democrat who plays politics to win. Instead of being pleased that
Clinton has enacted parts of their agenda, Republicans are furious
at him for co-opting the best bits of it.
 &HT;    With the end of their monopoly on such issues as crime, welfare
and balancing the budget, Republicans are forced to contend with
Democrats over issues where their positions are distinctly less
popular: education, the environment, Social Security and social
issues like abortion and homosexuality.
 &HT;    Clinton's seizure of the center has driven the GOP to the right,
empowering the radicals who want either to legislate on the basis
of a narrow moral code or drastically curtail the federal
government's role, or both. To conservatives, Clinton didn't win
the center legitimately. He stole it from them.
 &HT;    But the question of Clinton-hating finally transcends
conventional political analysis. It's personal and aggravated.
Detestation of the president is worsened by the phenomenon of
sustained public support for Clinton, which his opponents find
baffling. Why does this man's approval rating rise in the teeth of
humiliation?
 &HT;    At one level, Clinton's supporters have made a pragmatic
judgment that he governs in their interest. But at another level,
he draws on a reservoir not of love, not of respect even, but of
identification.
 &HT;    This identification works in two directions. It is partly the
public's identification with Clinton, the perpetual underdog who
refuses to ever quit fighting. To a public that consumes quantities
of confessional entertainment and self-help advice, Clinton's
turmoil seems not bizarre, but familiar.
 &HT;    His cyclical progress through stages of sin, denial, contrition
and forgiveness has humanized him like no previous president. To a
public that had already accepted Clinton with his faults, the Starr
report arrived not as a shocking indictment, but as a juicy soap
opera with footnotes. As with other celebrities, Clinton's
screw-ups are a comforting reminder that he isn't any better than
the rest of us and doesn't think that he is.
 &HT;    But possibly more important is the way Clinton himself
identifies with regular people. No one who has ever seen him work a
rope line or entertain questions at a town meeting can fail to be
impressed by the way that he engages with ordinary people.
 &HT;    In public forums, Clinton is not just indefatigable, requiring
his aides to forcibly pull him away from people who want to shake
his hand at the end of an evening. He is, unlike any other
politician of this generation, in his element with a crowd _ black,
white, religious, academic _ it almost doesn't matter.
 &HT;    Clinton moves an audience by empathizing with its feelings and
concerns. The way he draws sustenance by relating to strangers is
part and parcel of his political talent.
 &HT;    Clinton-haters of all kinds often describe the president's
caring about the problems of regular folk in terms of fakery. They
think his ``I feel your pain'' act is exactly that, a fraud, rather
than an expression of natural sympathy. There is in their anger at
him something of the mystification with which the liberal
intelligentsia beheld Reagan's popularity with the rest of the
country.
 &HT;    It's as if Clinton's bond with the public was based on some kind
of black art. In Reagan's case, this was chalked up to the mesmeric
power of his acting (a power never attributed to him during his
screen career). With no ready explanation of how Clinton does it,
conservatives like William Bennett have often taken the route of
becoming infuriated with the public for falling for such a
charlatan.
 &HT;    In both the popular defense of Clinton and the elite attacks
upon him, one hears the echoes of the passions evoked by two former
presidents: Andrew Jackson and Franklin Roosevelt. Jackson, like
Clinton, was twice elected president on the basis of a powerful
mutual identification with the public.
 &HT;    Conservatives suspected and feared Jackson's popularity, because
it represented a different version of democracy from the one the
founders had envisioned, a kind they saw as close to mob rule. FDR
had a similar bond with ordinary people, which opened up a well of
class resentment.
 &HT;    People who called Roosevelt ``that man'' felt that as a
patrician populist he was a phony and an opportunist. Many of
Clinton's critics see him likewise as a beneficiary of meritocratic
privilege who has seduced the heartland. They fear him, as they
feared Jackson and FDR, as a demagogue.
 &HT;    Clinton's bond with the public is based less on economic
unfairness than was Jackson's or Roosevelt's and more on a kind of
post-ideological pragmatism. He has devised an idiosyncratic
populism, based on the sense of him as a personally flawed but
public-spirited and highly intelligent leader ready to fight to his
last breath for the people who elected him.
 &HT;    Redefining government's role will never make Clinton beloved in
the way FDR is beloved. But he may well be remembered as a
president who squarely faced the big problem presented to him with
the resources at his command.
 &HT;    Someday, the loathing that Clinton provokes may be understood in
the context of his role in creating a post-Cold War presidency.
Americans may recognize that liberals objected to a narrower role
for government, that the Washington establishment resisted his
diminishing its stature and that conservatives objected to his
substituting prudent downsizing for radical deconstruction.
 &HT;    Knowing Clinton as it has known no other incumbent president,
the public has nonetheless refrained from judging him _ or at least
has been willing to judge him in his complexity, separating his
private behavior from his record.
 &HT;    Clinton is likely to remain an equivocal figure, a man of
significant accomplishments and flawed character, who created
gratuitous troubles but defined a social transformation in
surviving them. He may come to be remembered as the most
paradoxical president: an undisciplined man who restored trust in
government, while inspiring almost none in himself.

 &HT;    As a 10-year-old glued to the TV through the summer of
Watergate, I remember the air of gravity that hung over the
proceedings, the sense that it was a dreadful necessity to put a
president on trial.
 &HT;    I don't recall authority figures having to explain that it was a
national crisis _ even to a kid, that was pretty obvious.
 &HT;    And yet, one of the oddest things about the impeachment weekend
just before Christmas was the constant stream of reminders that
America again was again experiencing such a crisis. Legislators and
commentators kept trying to find more dramatic ways to frame the
events taking place.
 &HT;    Bill Clinton, they intoned, was about to become only the SECOND
president ever impeached. He would be our FIRST ELECTED president
ever impeached. All through the holidays and on into January the
tone remained the same: We were having the first Senate trial of a
president in 130 YEARS.
 &HT;    Watching TV was like having someone grab you by the lapels and
shout, Don't you understand this is supposed to be historic!
 &HT;    Clinton's impeachment is historic in the sense of it being an
event historians will puzzle over in decades to come. But what
those historians will have to ponder is not how it shook the
country, but why it didn't. They will have to explain how the
country experienced the form of a constitutional crisis without the
content of one, how an impeachment could drive a president's
approval rating up instead of down.
 &HT;    They may be better disposed than contemporary observers of the
Clinton scandal to look beyond the Dow Jones industrial average for
an explanation. For Clinton's weathering of the Lewinsky scandal
represents something that is truly historic _ a break in the way
the American presidency functions.
 &HT;    For the 60 years or so that preceded Clinton's election in 1992,
the nation lived through what might be described as the heroic
phase of the American presidency. Not that all modern presidents
have been heroes, of course. But beginning in the late 1920s, the
country was enveloped in a succession of crises _ the Great
Depression, World War II and the Cold War. We measured our
presidents against their roles in these great events.
 &HT;    Thankfully, we're now living in different times. The nation is
at peace and growing more prosperous, not merely or even mostly as
a consequence of executive decision-making, but as a backdrop to
it. This places a different and in some ways more difficult burden
on the leader of the free world.
 &HT;    An American president now has a more diffuse and bewildering
job. He must focus on a series of comparatively minor problems at
home, make sense of international confusion and compete for the
public's attention with more captivating forms of entertainment.
 &HT;    Clinton has not failed to keep his public entertained. To some
it has seemed like a tragedy, to others a sitcom. Following the
pattern of his career in Arkansas and of his accident-prone 1992
campaign, Clinton as president has repeatedly toyed with ruin,
practically digging his own grave, only to pop back up,
Houdini-like, after everyone thought he could no longer be
breathing.
 &HT;    With his impeachment on charges of perjury and obstruction of
justice, his dialogue with disaster has reached what is likely to
be its final phase (though another eruption is always possible).
 &HT;    The debate is no longer over Clinton's continued viability as a
politician, because he faces no more elections. The stain of
impeachment cannot be washed away by what he does in his remaining
time in the White House, because part of what his impeachment means
is that the House of Representatives is no longer much interested
in doing business with him.
 &HT;    A conviction in a Senate trial would make Clinton history sooner
rather than later, but whether he is convicted, acquitted or
censured as a result of some Senate-White House deal, it does not
seem too soon to try to characterize his presidency. Clinton is the
president who, for better and worse, turned the White House into a
governor's mansion.
 &HT;    Clinton was worried about his legacy long before he learned, a
year ago, that the world was about to learn about Monica Lewinsky.
In his book, ``Behind the Oval Office,'' Dick Morris described a
Sunday-morning phone conversation in August 1996 on the topic of
how Clinton would rate in the history books.
 &HT;    Clinton agreed he wasn't a top-tier president, but wondered what
he could do to make it into the ranks of Morris' second tier, with
Harry Truman, Theodore Roosevelt, Andrew Jackson and Ronald Reagan.
(Morris said he'd have to do three big things: make welfare reform
work, balance the federal budget and smash international terrorism,
on top of some littler things.)
 &HT;    Though the word ``legacy'' has a positive cast, presidential
historians often use it to convey a more neutral meaning. A legacy
is properly understood as a mark left on the country for good or
for ill. Popular democracy is Andrew Jackson's legacy. The national
park system is part of Theodore Roosevelt's. The New Deal, which
molded the modern federal government, is FDR's. Watergate is
Nixon's.
 &HT;    There are legacies of neglect, such as Ronald Reagan's bequest
to his successors of a vast federal budget deficit (offset by his
affirmative legacy of drawing the cold war to a surprising and
successful close). Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and George Bush, to
name three of our last five presidents, arguably left no major
legacy at all. The same is true of the late-19th-century presidents
who populate the murk between Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt.
 &HT;    We know something else about presidential legacies. Matters that
loom large now will diminish in retrospect. Clinton's popularity,
and by extension his survival as president, do rely heavily on the
extraordinary strength of the economy, now in the eighth year of
what will soon become our longest known peacetime expansion. But
over time, even that impressive statistic is likely to fade in
importance.
 &HT;    A lousy economy can define a presidency, as it did for Herbert
Hoover. But the simple fact of a good economy tends not to make a
legacy. If it did, Eisenhower, Johnson and Nixon would be
considered greater presidents than FDR and Truman.
 &HT;    There is already a rough consensus among historians that Clinton
is a significant president. He stands to be remembered, most
obviously, for causing a big scandal and getting impeached, but
also for getting re-elected, something no Democrat since FDR had
done.
 &HT;    But Clinton, I think, will also be remembered for reforming the
federal government and for reshaping his party. Most strikingly,
Clinton, like Andrew Jackson and FDR, has changed the very nature
of the American presidency. Where those two presidents expanded the
role and importance of the presidency, Clinton has downsized the
office, both in the negative sense of stripping away some of its
dignity and in the positive one of making adjustments demanded by
the historical moment.
 &HT;    Coming to the White House from the governor's mansion in Little
Rock, Clinton has recast the presidency on the more modest model of
his previous job. Unlike presidents, governors have few
opportunities to be visionaries. Instead, they do what Clinton has
done _ a job of crisis management, political accommodation and
governmental reform.
 &HT;    In one way, the public doesn't expect much from a governor; in
another way it expects a great deal. A governor is expected to
address whatever issues arise, from upgrading the skills of his
state's work force to reducing traffic congestion on its highways.
 &HT;    Financial constraints deny governors the possibility of grander
schemes. Within the confines of balanced and limited budgets,
however, they can distinguish themselves with creative
social-policy ideas. In smaller states, the governor is a familiar
figure whose blunders and foibles are as well known as his cartoon
caricature.
 &HT;    If the governor proves himself intelligent and capable, people
tend to be willing to indulge a fair amount of rascality on his
part. As flawed as he may be, he's all that protects them from a
Legislature that's inevitably far worse than he is.
 &HT;    Governors, of course, don't shape foreign policy. There's no
doubt Clinton will be remembered as primarily a domestic president
and perhaps the first in a line of domestic presidents who followed
the Cold War.
 &HT;    Clinton ran on domestic and economic issues in 1992, in answer
to George Bush's international focus. His platform, ``Putting
People First,'' the most detailed policy statement ever issued by a
candidate, elaborated a series of ideas about how to make
government more effective.
 &HT;    Clinton has improved a range of federal agencies and programs.
But what may stand as most significant is not just that he mended
broken policies, but that in fact he managed to restore the feeling
among Americans that domestic government works.

 &HT;    
 By JACOB WEISBERG  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    From his first presidential campaign, Bill Clinton was guided by
a revised philosophy of government's role.
 &HT;    Perhaps one of the most underappreciated things Clinton did
during his first year in office was expanding the Earned Income Tax
Credit, a program by which the federal government supplements the
income of low-wage workers.
 &HT;    Clinton's notion was that if you work full time, you shouldn't
have an income below the poverty line. A government commitment to
this principle exemplified his reform liberalism. As a successor to
the New Deal-Great Society archetype of ever-expanding social
benefits, Clinton proposed a more modest, reciprocal model, one
based on what he has described as an exchange of opportunity for
responsibility, and hence a model based on more limited
expectations of what the federal government can do.
 &HT;    During his 1992 campaign, Clinton characterized this notion, in
a phrase coined by Will Marshall of the Progressive Policy
Institute, as the ``New Covenant.'' Clinton's subsequent successes,
such as national service and welfare reform, have come from
applying this notion of a limited social contract.
 &HT;    His early failures occurred when he strayed from it, relapsing
into the older pattern of delivering new federal benefits from on
high. Most notable was his failure in health care.
 &HT;    It's possible that a better-designed and more politically astute
plan could have placed his presidency on stronger footing. But
Clinton botched the design and marketing of his plan, setting
himself at odds with moderates in both parties whose support he
needed.
 &HT;    Considering himself a centrist reformer, Clinton didn't see the
potential for his ``managed competition'' scheme to be portrayed as
an oldfangled liberal spending program.
 &HT;    What Clinton didn't yet get was the depth of the discontent with
the way government was working. When he took office, trust in
government had been steadily eroding for a quarter century. In
1964, 76 percent of Americans told pollsters they thought they
could trust government to do the right thing all or most of the
time. In 1994, the year Clinton's plan for health-care reform
fizzled, the number who said they trusted government bottomed out
at 15 percent.
 &HT;    The nature of this disillusion is a debate of its own, but it
was based at least in part on the failures of government in welfare
and public housing, in worsening crime and deteriorating public
education.
 &HT;    This loss of confidence easily attached itself to Clinton's
attempt to award the federal government another vast
responsibility. Clinton was regarded as someone who had promised
change and failed to deliver. This frustration came to fruition in
1994.
 &HT;    Not until the ascendancy of the Gingrich Congress did Clinton
fully grasp the depth of disenchantment with Washington. But from
that point on, Clinton began to understand that he had to grapple
with this corrosive skepticism.
 &HT;    Michael Waldman, Clinton's chief speech writer, remembers
sitting with him in the White House residence working on last
year's State of the Union address. At one point, according to
Waldman, Clinton paused and remarked that ``FDR's mission was to
save capitalism from its excesses. Our mission has been to save
government from its own excesses so it can again be a progressive
force.''
 &HT;    The idea of Clinton as the savior of liberal government will
strike many as perverse. Following the 1994 election, Clinton faced
tremendous criticism, not just from Republicans but also from
Democrats who felt he was trying to jettison, inan effort at
conciliation, the party's bedrock beliefs.
 &HT;    The lightning rod for this anger became his nefarious political
consultant Dick Morris, whom Democratic traditionalists saw as
pulling Clinton not in the direction of reform, but toward a dead
centrism derived from opinion polls. Clinton was much ridiculed for
proposing microinterventions like free walkie-talkies for
neighborhood watch groups.
 &HT;    But what Clinton was beginning to understand was that
government's failures weren't arcane managerial issues; they were
questions of public trust. While devising gubernatorial-scale
programs that encapsulated his New Covenant approach, he proceeded
to address the two biggest causes of that mistrust.
 &HT;    First, Clinton agreed to the Republican goal of a balanced
budget. But where the GOP long supported a balanced budget as a
means of downsizing government, Clinton saw it as a way to
reinvigorate government. From his first economic plan in 1993,
Clinton regarded the deficit as a problem serious enough to warrant
putting many of his pet projects on hold.
 &HT;    What he subsequently discovered was that by operating within the
context of a balanced budget, he could argue for expanding spending
in certain areas, like school construction or national service,
without being accused of fiscal irresponsibility. The federal
budget had become like a state budget. Only if government was
convincingly limited in size could it hope to get away with
activism.
 &HT;    His second and arguably more important decision was following
through on his campaign promise to end welfare ``as we know it.''
Many liberals mistook Clinton's interest in the subject as
political; they saw the subtext as race baiting. In fact, Clinton
saw welfare as disruptive of the proper relationship between
government and its citizens. The system's unpopularity was not just
because of its being counterproductive or a waste of resources, but
because it offered something for nothing.
 &HT;    Members of Clinton's cabinet objected strenuously to his
decision to accept a modified Republican bill based on the idea of
block grants, and a few of his own policy makers resigned in
protest over the issue. The smoke of battle obscured the fact that
Clinton was following through on his New Covenant notion of welfare
reform and not merely acceding to a punitive rollback.
 &HT;    Clinton could also see that the country's governors, already
embarked on a variety of welfare-reform experiments, were in the
best position to know how the system might be fixed. Only in the
last year has it become evident that Clinton did reform welfare
largely in the way he said he would with pretty much the results he
anticipated.
 &HT;    Welfare rolls have declined from 5 million families in 1995 to 3
million in June 1998. A downturn in the economy could curtail this
progress by making it harder to place people in jobs, but at the
moment the national picture is one of drastically declining levels
of dependency with scant evidence of increased misery.
 &HT;    These promising signs have been accompanied by progress in other
areas in which government has failed. Under Henry Cisneros, the
Department of Housing and Urban Development actually began breaking
up pockets of concentrated poverty by tearing down parts of the
worst urban housing projects and moving to voucher-based subsidies.
 &HT;    Cities have also benefited from two changes that may have been
largely incidental to Clinton's agenda _ a big drop in crime and
the end of a long-term increase in out-of-wedlock births. Together
these developments have begun to have a tipping-point effect for
America's urban centers.
 &HT;    It's too early to say that these improvements have restored the
30-year slide in faith in government. But from its low in 1994,
confidence in government had recovered more than 20 points by early
1998. Impeachment has driven it down a bit _ but to nowhere near
its lowest level.

 &HT;    
 By JACOB WEISBERG  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Before Bill Clinton was elected in 1992, conventional wisdom
held that the Democrats faced a crisis. After 12 years of GOP White
House rule and defeat in five of the previous six presidential
elections, the party had seemingly ceased to become competitive at
the presidential level.
 &HT;    Peter Brown's 1991 book, ``Minority Party: Why Democrats Face
Defeat in 1992 and Beyond,'' was one of several arguing the thesis.
White working-class and suburban middle-class voters, according to
the conventional wisdom, were abandoning the party in droves
because of its excessively liberal positions on crime, welfare,
foreign policy and ``values'' issues.
 &HT;    How could the Democrats become politically competitive again in
an era when what the party once stood for _ an expanding federal
role _ was proving less and less popular? The party itself was
deeply divided over how and whether it should evolve.
 &HT;    On one side was a group of centrist reformers clustered around
the Democratic Leadership Council. On the other was a rump of
liberal traditionalists, including labor unions and minority groups
who viewed DLC positions as treasonable to their basic beliefs.
 &HT;    Clinton has faced the problems of his party _ at least at the
presidential level _ methodically, systematically and effectively.
To a remarkable degree, he has succeeded in making once seemingly
incurable ailments vanish, while giving back to the Democrats the
kind of well-oiled national political machine they had before 1968.
 &HT;    His first task was pulling thorns from the party paw. Asked
which party did a better job handling crime, voters chose the GOP
by a margin of 18 points in 1991.
 &HT;    Clinton reversed this pattern by jettisoning Dukakis-era
positions such as opposition to the death penalty while exploiting
the one aspect of the issue where public opinion diverges from the
dictates of GOP interest-group politics: gun control.
 &HT;    Clinton doesn't have much of a basis for claiming that it's his
policies that have reduced crime rates over the past several years,
but he has put away the charge that Democrats don't like punishing
criminals. Recent surveys show the parties polling essentially even
on the issue.
 &HT;    What's most remarkable is not that Clinton has taken crime and
other reliable wedge issues away from Republicans. It's that he has
done so while unifying a party that was itself divided over these
issues. In 1992, both the New Democrats and the traditionalists
supported Clinton in the belief that he was, at heart, one of them.
 &HT;    Perhaps inevitably, both sides were disappointed in the way he
governed. For much of his first term Clinton was out of favor with
the center or the left of his party, or both at the same time.
 &HT;    In his first two years, the DLC saw Clinton as swinging left
with his health-care plan and tax increase. In his second two
years, liberals griped over Clinton's accession to a balanced
budget and welfare reform. But by the time of the 1996 election,
Clinton had again forged an alliance.
 &HT;    Many people are puzzled about how Clinton has been able to
appease liberal constituencies while flouting their principles _
confronting unions with Nafta, poor blacks with welfare reform,
teachers with charter schools and feminists with Paula Jones.
 &HT;    The simplest explanation is that he has restored a model last
seen among Democrats during the presidency of Lyndon Johnson, when
those joining his coalition got to experience victory and taste
power. Clinton has created a sense of partisan pride powerful
enough to quell the narcissism of small differences.
 &HT;    This thrill of putting up a good fight against a common enemy _
something presidents as different as Ronald Reagan and Franklin
Roosevelt once created and used _ has overcome ideological and
sometimes moral scruples. Democratic activists have taken the
advice Clinton gave a group of them in 1981: ``When someone is
beating you over the head with a hammer ... take out a meat cleaver
and cut off their hand.''
 &HT;    It hasn't always been pretty, or even, perhaps, ethical. Since
1992, Clinton's style has been to dispense with qualms and play
politics in as ruthless and relentless a way as the GOP. In the
1980s, Reagan and George Bush were charged with relying on polling
to an unprecedented degree. Clinton has gone them one better,
market-testing his rhetoric, then deploying it with a numbing
repetitive precision.
 &HT;    He answered the slick fabrications of Michael Deaver with the
more subtle and compelling mythography of Harry Thomason and Linda
Bloodworth-Thomason. He dug deeper for dirt on his opponents,
devised more effective 30-second attack ads and showed great
ingenuity in exploiting loopholes in the campaign finance law.
 &HT;    The biggest change is financial. In the 1980s, the GOP advantage
in fund-raising was as high as 5 to 1. In the 1992 election cycle,
Clinton and Ron Brown, then chairman of the Democratic National
Committee, whittled it down to 3 to 2. In 1996, Clinton and Harold
Ickes nearly caught up in the chief corporate category, so-called
soft money, bringing in $123 million to the GOP's $138 million.
 &HT;    They did this with willful blindness about the sources of these
funds. Clinton's attitude is that because the rules aren't enforced
and Republicans are preventing him from creating a level playing
field, he is free to fight as dirty as they do.
 &HT;    Since the Lewinsky scandal, various sectors of the ideologically
disgruntled Democratic ``base'' _ those who might be thought to be
less than keen about Clinton's small-bore, poll-driven,
corporate-friendly centrism _ have been the president's staunchest
supporters.
 &HT;    Black leaders disappointed with Clinton over matters ranging
from the balanced budget to welfare reform have flocked to his
defense. Among blacks, Clinton's approval rating remains as high as
Ronald Reagan's rating was among conservative Republicans.
 &HT;    This is a testament in part to the real feeling Clinton evinces
over racial issues, as well as to black sensitivity to
prosecutorial unfairness and sympathy for victims of persecution.
But it also speaks to a different kind of party, one in which
members are willing to settle for half a loaf.
 &HT;    Republicans, on the other hand, now face the problem of a
radical base that has lost its willingness to postpone
gratification. The adage that Democrats look for heretics while
Republicans seek converts has ceased to apply.
 &HT;    To a remarkable degree, the parties have switched places.
Clinton's political formula is now almost universally regarded as a
winning one for Democrats. All of the serious contenders for the
2000 Democratic nomination have indicated their desire to continue
in the same basic direction.
 &HT;    Al Gore, Bill Bradley and John Kerry have all positioned
themselves as Clinton Democrats. The potential contenders who do
not fit this profile _ Paul Wellstone and Jesse Jackson _ are
running as protest candidates. Clinton's ``Third Way'' formula has
an international following as well. From a historical viewpoint,
the question is whether a Democratic successor will be able to
carry off Clinton's balancing act within the party.
 &HT;    There is a worrisome analogy in the GOP, where Reagan became a
successful two-term president by appeasing the religious right
while reaching out to moderate voters. Bush's efforts to sustain
this equilibrium made the Republican right truculent to the point
of self-destructiveness. Today the GOP remains badly divided,
looking back to the Reagan years as an irretrievable golden age.
 &HT;    Clinton's successor, almost certain to lack his political gifts
and perhaps his ruthlessness, faces an enormous challenge in
maintaining the Clinton coalition.

 &HT;    Even if President Bill Clinton is not convicted by the U.S.
Senate and does finish his second term, impeachment will still be
in the first paragraph of his obituary.
 &HT;    At some level, Clinton can't escape becoming a historical joke.
 &HT;    He is now and forever our priapic president, who takes his place
alongside our drunken president, Ulysses S. Grant, our napping
president, Calvin Coolidge, and our treacherous president, Richard
Nixon.
 &HT;    Whatever else he does in office, Clinton will not be able to
keep this out of his capsule biography: He's the one who had oral
sex with a 21-year-old intern in the Oval Office, got caught, lied,
caused a national spectacle and saw it undermine his second term.
This story line may be tempered with sympathy.
 &HT;    In a longer view, Clinton's libido may not differentiate him
from Franklin Roosevelt (who died with his mistress, not his wife)
or John Kennedy (who arranged orgies in the White House swimming
pool). But it will be hard to avoid the view that there was
something more reckless about Clinton, because he had no basis for
thinking the press would protect him, as it did his predecessors.
 &HT;    Nor can Clinton escape his reputation for being slippery. He is
not the first president to lie, or lie under oath. But he will
surely be remembered as someone who habitually played games with
the truth.
 &HT;    Clinton is the president who said he never inhaled, who told a
national audience, ``I did not have sexual relations with that
woman'' _ and considered it true because his definition of sexual
relations did not include receiving oral sex.
 &HT;    The most evasive of these lines, such as ``It depends on what
the meaning of the word 'is' is,'' are destined for inclusion in
Bartlett's. Clinton is to hairsplitting legalisms what Yogi Berra
is to tautological absurdities; he seems nearly to have invented
the form.
 &HT;    It will also be recalled that he was disloyal to friends and
took advantage of people who worked for him. Early in his
presidency, Clinton failed to stand by nominees in trouble, even
when they were old friends like Zoe Baird. He has taken advantage
of faithful aides, using and disposing of them when convenient, as
with Harold Ickes, whom Clinton threw overboard after Ickes
finished the dirty work involved in getting him re-elected.
 &HT;    His sexual incontinence was itself a betrayal of people who
spent years working for him, some of whom faced their own legal
problems because they helped protect him. He led subordinates like
his former press secretary Michael McCurry to damage their own
professional reputations by amplifying his lies. Clinton will be
remembered as, among other things, a cad.
 &HT;    But more significant than what the impeachment episode says
about Clinton's character may be what it tells us about national
mores at century's end. Contrary to the prediction of many
reporters, myself included, the scandal not only did not end his
presidency; it actually made a president re-elected on a ``values''
agenda more popular.
 &HT;    When the scandal first broke a year ago, Washington reporters
were still dealing with the issue of whether to protect the public
from information they assumed it was too unsophisticated to handle.
Few suspected how much the rest of the country had changed in the
previous decade. The America of today is no longer the America of
1987, the year that Gary Hart was driven from a presidential race
by the Donna Rice scandal and that Clinton decided not to go for
the nomination after his aide Betsey Wright presented him with a
list of ex-lovers capable of sabotaging his candidacy.
 &HT;    Clinton is not simply the beneficiary of the arrival of a more
tolerant moral standard; he is personally responsible for its
application to politics. He was the first presidential candidate to
publicly acknowledge that he had committed adultery. Some have
argued that, based on the famous ``60 Minutes'' appearance, in
which he acknowledged causing pain in his marriage, there was an
implicit bargain between Clinton and the voters. If we elected him,
he promised to sin no more.
 &HT;    But the real proposition was direct and explicit: Clinton stood
for office on the basis of what he could do rather than who he
would be. Unlike previous presidents, he proposed to be hired on
the basis of his abilities and his approach to government, not his
qualities as a moral exemplar. He was promising to be a good
governor.
 &HT;    Such a promise is built into Clinton's own view of government.
His notion of a ``New Covenant'' implies a transformation in
expectations. Washington no longer delivers solutions to our
problems; it merely helps us to solve them. Not looking to
government as an all-purpose savior implies no longer putting
politicians on a pedestal.
 &HT;    To perform their new role, leaders don't have to be ideal human
beings, superior projections of ourselves. They merely need to
understand our problems and help us grapple with them. If they hold
up their end of the bargain, by governing well, we won't go beyond
ours by judging them harshly for inevitable human failings. While
he has surely tested our commitment to this pact, Clinton has held
up his end of it.
 &HT;    The compact that Clinton embodies has emerged as our country's
de facto standard of political morality. We are still less
dismissive of marital infidelity than, say, the French. But like
the Europeans and Canadians, we now distinguish public from private
in the lives of our leaders, and forbear from judgments about the
latter.
 &HT;    The new rules have not taken hold everywhere yet. Much of the
press has yet to assimilate the concept that most of the public no
longer considers intrusive reporting about private lives relevant
to democratic decision-making. Nonetheless, a president with a rare
ability to compartmentalize his psyche has ratified a new attitude
toward the private lives of public figures.
 &HT;    You can go further than that and say that the Lewinsky scandal
says something not just about the development of American political
morality, but also about American morality in general. A quick
survey might leave one with the impression that the 199os were the
decade that Puritanism died.
 &HT;    Since Clinton has been president, homosexuality has gained
public acceptance; legal gambling has swept the country;
pornography has become ubiquitous; and vice has been redefined as
disease. Meanwhile, the public has become unshockable about sex and
unconcerned about presidential adultery. These changes imply that
traditional morality has receded.
 &HT;    But something more complicated is going on. The same public that
has forgiven Clinton his trespasses holds to a strict personal
morality and has endorsed Clinton's emphasis on ``values'' in
government programs - what Prof. Michael Sandel of Harvard calls
Clinton's repudiation of ``moral neutrality'' in public policy.
 &HT;    The harmonization of these seeming contradictions may be arising
from the increasingly subtle distinction Americans are making
between the public and private realms. One striking thing the
sociologist Alan Wolfe shows in his book ``One Nation, After All''
is that while American suburbanites are far from relativistic in
their own moral views, they shrink from judging the private
behavior of others, and dislike moralizing when they see it
practiced. At the same time, they want government policy to support
their values.
 &HT;    The Lewinsky scandal writes these distinctions large. Few
approve of Clinton's behavior. Yet the vast majority object even
more to casting stones at the president for mistakes in an area
where he is answerable to his family and his God, not to voters or
the media. Though these mistakes may make it impossible for Clinton
to talk about values any longer, voters care more about how he
applied his views in public - welfare reform, for example - than
how he violated them in private.
 &HT;    Clinton didn't devise this ethic, but his election and survival
encapsulate it. He leaves behind an electorate that wants its
values embedded in public policy, but that no longer moralizes
about private behavior.

 &HT;    
 By JACOB WEISBERG  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The most common explanation for the animosity against President
Bill Clinton is that it is an expression of ``a culture war.''
 &HT;    In their strenuous dislike of the president, the idea goes,
conservatives are fighting a battle over the 1960s and its legacy.
Clinton is the first baby-boomer president, the first who dodged
the Vietnam draft and admitted to smoking marijuana.
 &HT;    His conservative opponents, including many members of the same
generation, see such a figure as a threat to the moral order.
During the impeachment fight, Tom DeLay, the House Republican whip,
described it as ``a debate about relativism vs. absolute truth.''
 &HT;    But the culture-war argument doesn't do justice to an antipathy
that goes back to Clinton's candidacy. I think there are three
separate psychological profiles of Clinton-hating, which have
blurred together at times.
 &HT;    _ The first type of Clinton-hater is liberal, and he does derive
his hatred from the 60s.
 &HT;    His is the view that Clinton is a fundamentally disingenuous and
inauthentic person who uses public interest as a cover for private
ambition. This opinion, which is manifest in much of Clinton's
press coverage, does not draw a line between the personal and the
political. The problem isn't that Clinton committed adultery or
that he lied about adultery.
 &HT;    Indeed, these lapses have inclined liberal critics to support
him. What they object to is that Clinton cares about winning more
than he cares about principles; that he has thrown overboard such
worthy causes as civil liberties, intervention in Bosnia, human
rights in China and campaign finance reform.
 &HT;    _ A second kind of hostility to Clinton is neither liberal nor
conservative but comes from the Washington establishment. Sally
Quinn, the journalist and Washington hostess, has written that the
Clintons ``dissed'' Georgetown society by neglecting its advice and
avoiding its company.
 &HT;    This is true, but the falling out goes well beyond a mere social
snub. By downsizing the presidency and ushering in an era of a less
ambitious federal government, Clinton has made Washington and its
establishment less important. By turning away from both foreign
affairs and big-ticket domestic programs, Clinton has made
Washington less central to the concerns of the nation than it was
in the days of SALT treaties.
 &HT;    Turning the presidency into the country's biggest governor's job
is contrary to the political establishment's sense of the office
and their relation to it. By allowing the Lewinsky scandal to
happen, Clinton has turned the American presidency (and by
extension those who feed off it) into an international
laughingstock.
 &HT;    ``Clinton acted ... as if he does not recognize what it means to
be president of the United States,'' wrote David Broder, a
Washington Post columnist, after Clinton's first nationally
televised mea culpa.
 &HT;    _ The third and most potent kind of Clinton-hating is
conservative, but is related to the liberal kind in its aversion to
a Democrat who plays politics to win. Instead of being pleased that
Clinton has enacted parts of their agenda, Republicans are furious
at him for co-opting the best bits of it.
 &HT;    With the end of their monopoly on such issues as crime, welfare
and balancing the budget, Republicans are forced to contend with
Democrats over issues where their positions are distinctly less
popular: education, the environment, Social Security and social
issues like abortion and homosexuality.
 &HT;    Clinton's seizure of the center has driven the GOP to the right,
empowering the radicals who want either to legislate on the basis
of a narrow moral code or drastically curtail the federal
government's role, or both. To conservatives, Clinton didn't win
the center legitimately. He stole it from them.
 &HT;    But the question of Clinton-hating finally transcends
conventional political analysis. It's personal and aggravated.
Detestation of the president is worsened by the phenomenon of
sustained public support for Clinton, which his opponents find
baffling. Why does this man's approval rating rise in the teeth of
humiliation?
 &HT;    At one level, Clinton's supporters have made a pragmatic
judgment that he governs in their interest. But at another level,
he draws on a reservoir not of love, not of respect even, but of
identification.
 &HT;    This identification works in two directions. It is partly the
public's identification with Clinton, the perpetual underdog who
refuses to ever quit fighting. To a public that consumes quantities
of confessional entertainment and self-help advice, Clinton's
turmoil seems not bizarre, but familiar.
 &HT;    His cyclical progress through stages of sin, denial, contrition
and forgiveness has humanized him like no previous president. To a
public that had already accepted Clinton with his faults, the Starr
report arrived not as a shocking indictment, but as a juicy soap
opera with footnotes. As with other celebrities, Clinton's
screw-ups are a comforting reminder that he isn't any better than
the rest of us and doesn't think that he is.
 &HT;    But possibly more important is the way Clinton himself
identifies with regular people. No one who has ever seen him work a
rope line or entertain questions at a town meeting can fail to be
impressed by the way that he engages with ordinary people.
 &HT;    In public forums, Clinton is not just indefatigable, requiring
his aides to forcibly pull him away from people who want to shake
his hand at the end of an evening. He is, unlike any other
politician of this generation, in his element with a crowd _ black,
white, religious, academic _ it almost doesn't matter.
 &HT;    Clinton moves an audience by empathizing with its feelings and
concerns. The way he draws sustenance by relating to strangers is
part and parcel of his political talent.
 &HT;    Clinton-haters of all kinds often describe the president's
caring about the problems of regular folk in terms of fakery. They
think his ``I feel your pain'' act is exactly that, a fraud, rather
than an expression of natural sympathy. There is in their anger at
him something of the mystification with which the liberal
intelligentsia beheld Reagan's popularity with the rest of the
country.
 &HT;    It's as if Clinton's bond with the public was based on some kind
of black art. In Reagan's case, this was chalked up to the mesmeric
power of his acting (a power never attributed to him during his
screen career). With no ready explanation of how Clinton does it,
conservatives like William Bennett have often taken the route of
becoming infuriated with the public for falling for such a
charlatan.
 &HT;    In both the popular defense of Clinton and the elite attacks
upon him, one hears the echoes of the passions evoked by two former
presidents: Andrew Jackson and Franklin Roosevelt. Jackson, like
Clinton, was twice elected president on the basis of a powerful
mutual identification with the public.
 &HT;    Conservatives suspected and feared Jackson's popularity, because
it represented a different version of democracy from the one the
founders had envisioned, a kind they saw as close to mob rule. FDR
had a similar bond with ordinary people, which opened up a well of
class resentment.
 &HT;    People who called Roosevelt ``that man'' felt that as a
patrician populist he was a phony and an opportunist. Many of
Clinton's critics see him likewise as a beneficiary of meritocratic
privilege who has seduced the heartland. They fear him, as they
feared Jackson and FDR, as a demagogue.
 &HT;    Clinton's bond with the public is based less on economic
unfairness than was Jackson's or Roosevelt's and more on a kind of
post-ideological pragmatism. He has devised an idiosyncratic
populism, based on the sense of him as a personally flawed but
public-spirited and highly intelligent leader ready to fight to his
last breath for the people who elected him.
 &HT;    Redefining government's role will never make Clinton beloved in
the way FDR is beloved. But he may well be remembered as a
president who squarely faced the big problem presented to him with
the resources at his command.
 &HT;    Someday, the loathing that Clinton provokes may be understood in
the context of his role in creating a post-Cold War presidency.
Americans may recognize that liberals objected to a narrower role
for government, that the Washington establishment resisted his
diminishing its stature and that conservatives objected to his
substituting prudent downsizing for radical deconstruction.
 &HT;    Knowing Clinton as it has known no other incumbent president,
the public has nonetheless refrained from judging him _ or at least
has been willing to judge him in his complexity, separating his
private behavior from his record.
 &HT;    Clinton is likely to remain an equivocal figure, a man of
significant accomplishments and flawed character, who created
gratuitous troubles but defined a social transformation in
surviving them. He may come to be remembered as the most
paradoxical president: an undisciplined man who restored trust in
government, while inspiring almost none in himself.

<P>
   Bill Clinton's optimistic State of the Union address and his
promise of a New Dawn for America are stirring new debate over the
likelihood of his continued presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Pegged to this debate, The New York Times Syndicate is offering
``Bill Clinton's Legacy (The First Draft),'' a five-part series
adapted from Jacob Weisberg's prescient article in The New York
Times Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   _ PART I: BILL CLINTON'S LEGACY: THE FIRST DRAFT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton's weathering of the Lewinsky scandal represents
something that is truly historic _ a break in the way the American
presidency functions. He has changed the nature of the presidency,
removed its heroic mandate and downsized the office as demanded by
the historical moment.
</P>
<P>
   _ PART II: BILL CLINTON: THE GOVERNOR-PRESIDENT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In his concern with Social Security, welfare, health insurance,
the minimum wage and other issues generally thought of in
connection with state government, President Clinton has made the
Oval Office into a kind of extended governor's mansion.
</P>
<P>
   _ PART III: HOW BILL CLINTON CREATED A DEMOCRATIC COALITION &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the Democratic Party, Clinton has made ``incurable''
ailments vanish, jettisoning Dukakis-era positions such as
opposition to the death penalty, putting away the idea that
Democrats are fuzzy liberals who are ``soft on crime.'' He has
created a sense of partisan pride and given party members a new
taste of power.
</P>
<P>
   _ PART IV: BILL CLINTON'S PERSONALLY FLAWED POPULISM &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton will be remembered as one who played games with the
truth, but whose claim to government was based on what he could do,
not his qualities as a moral exemplar.
</P>
<P>
   _ PART V: IS A `CULTURE WAR' TO BLAME FOR CLINTON'S
DETRACTORS? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives such as Bill Bennett often take the route of
becoming infuriated with the public for falling for Bill Clinton, a
man some say is a charlatan. There are three profiles of
Clinton-hating, actually; what's behind them?

AFTER 60 YEARS, JOHN RAITT STILL HAPPIEST WHEN HE'S SINGING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - On April 19, 1945, John Raitt introduced Broadway
theater audiences to his roguish alter ego, carnival barker Billy
Bigelow in ``Carousel.``
</P>
<P>
   They hated the abusive Billy. Then they loved him, persuaded by
the vulnerable charm of Raitt's moving performance.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty years later, theatergoers found themselves falling for
charming Billy all over again when the Richard Rodgers/Oscar
Hammerstein II musical returned, riding the wave of revival madness
that swept Broadway with new productions of such classics as
``Oklahoma!,'' ``The King and I,'' ``State Fair,'' ``Showboat'' and
``Annie Get Your Gun.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience reception was testimony to the enduring appeal of
the American musical theater of the '40s and '50s and the failure
of modern musicals to captivate audiences as Broadway once did.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be fooled by the record-setting run of ``Cats.'' No one
composing today, Raitt says, equals the staying power of master
songwriters like Lerner and Lowe, Jerome Kern, Irving Berlin and
Rodgers and Hart.
</P>
<P>
   And especially Rodgers and Hammerstein.
</P>
<P>
   As Raitt and singer Constance Towers prepare to bring their
cavalcade of show tunes to the Chandler (Ariz.) Center for the Arts
on Feb. 6 in a production called ``Something Wonderful,'' Raitt
says both singers owe their careers to the legendary duo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're both products of Rodgers and Hammerstein,'' he says by
phone from his home in Pacific Palisades, Calif. ``Where would we
be without Rodgers and Hammerstein?''
</P>
<P>
   In opera, perhaps. Raitt was headed that way when he auditioned
for Hammerstein with a selection from ``Barber of Seville.''
Convinced they had found their Billy, the songwriting team tailored
the role to Raitt and wrote a soliloquy just for him.
</P>
<P>
   Raitt played Billy Bigelow for the first two years of
``Carousel's'' long and popular run, bringing fresh enthusiasm to
the role every night with as many as eight performances a week.
</P>
<P>
   Turning 82 at the end of this month, Raitt admits he doesn't
hear or smell as well as he once did, walks a little more slowly
and says his vocal range has dropped a few notes.
</P>
<P>
   But his energy level is unflagging. Besides ``Something
Wonderful,'' he also is touring with singer Anna Maria Alberghetti
in a production called ``Broadway Tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   And ever the dutiful father, he always is ready to join daughter
and superstar singer Bonnie Raitt on stage whenever she asks.
Returning the favor, she sings three numbers on Dad's newest CD,
``John Raitt: Broadway Legend.''
</P>
<P>
   Father and daughter recently performed in a charity concert in
California for victims of last year's hurricane in Honduras. Bonnie
suggested Dad sing something bilingual. He chose ``Granada,'' and
when he hit that high E-natural, holding the note for what seemed
an eternity, the audience rose in a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Singing comes as naturally as talking for Raitt, and even in
interviews, he slips in and out of music, crooning a few bars in
between the recounting of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Santa Ana, Calif., Raitt began singing while making his
name as a high school track star. After earning an athletic
scholarship, he studied physical education at the University of
Southern California and University of Redlands. His dream of
running in the Olympics went up in smoke when the Germans bombed
Helsinki, Finland, in 1940 and America was drawn into World War II
the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for Raitt and for American theater audiences, Rodgers
and Hammerstein discovered him in the national company of
``Oklahoma!'' and tapped him as their first Billy Bigelow, a role
that remains his favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, there's hardly been a musical Raitt hasn't done:
``Oklahoma!,'' ``Pajama Game,'' ``Man of La Mancha,'' ``Annie Get
Your Gun,'' ``The Music Man,'' ``Camelot,'' ``Kiss Me Kate,''
``Fiddler on the Roof,'' ``On a Clear Day,'' ``Zorba,'' ``South
Pacific,'' ``Shenandoah.''
</P>
<P>
   Next to ``Carousel,'' he counts ``Zorba'' and the Civil War saga
``Shenandoah'' as his favorites.
</P>
<P>
   He credits the popularity of the musical theater to its
home-grown heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so American. The first act of ``Oklahoma!'' is the best
first act of any show. It just comes rolling out at you,'' he says,
warbling a few notes of ``Oh What a Beautiful Morning.``
</P>
<P>
   Raitt is less enamored of the movie versions of Broadway shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carousel'': ``I never really saw it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oklahoma!'': ``Fair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``South Pacific'': ``A joke.'' All those colored lights swirling
over Bali Hai.
</P>
<P>
   But, he concedes, it's difficult to ruin a Rodgers and
Hammerstein show. The score saves it.
</P>
<P>
   Raitt doesn't get back to New York much these days. His third
wife, Rosemary, to whom he's been married 17 years, suffers from
post-polio syndrome. Raitt is devoted to her care.
</P>
<P>
   But the couple do get out some, and she'll accompany him on his
upcoming Florida tour.
</P>
<P>
   Today's New York theater doesn't interest him.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Lloyd Webber, composer of ``Cats,'' ``Phantom of the
Opera'' and the already-dead ``Sunset Boulevard,'' comes as close
as anyone to re-creating the old magic, he said. He likes Webber's
hit song, ``Memories,'' the standout from ``Cats.''
</P>
<P>
   But Raitt is unenthusiastic about other shows, even the Broadway
blockbusters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen ``Rent.'' I don't want to see ``Rent,'''' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   If John Raitt is living in the past, so is the rest of America.
Revivals continue to delight Broadway patrons.
</P>
<P>
   And Raitt continues to delight his audiences. He's still
happiest, he says, when he's singing. After more than 60 years, he
can't stop and rarely turns down an invitation. If he's not
singing, it's only because he hasn't been asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like an old horse that loves to run,'' he says. ``I love
to sing.'' &QL;

SERVING, DIPPING DO'S AND DON'TS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JAIMEE ROSE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Tips for serving, how to avoid burning, and other
fondue learning:
</P>
<P>
   - Keep the heat low. Chocolate and cheese burn quickly. To avoid
this, look for a fondue pot with a double boiler or fill the fondue
pot with water and top it with a similar-size stainless-steel
mixing bowl of your own. Create your masterpiece in this bowl.
</P>
<P>
   - Direct participating dippers indulging in chocolate and cheese
to plunge their bread and fruit pieces into the pot and swirl them
in a figure-eight manner. This keeps the mixture stirred and
prevents gloppiness, separation and other dip don'ts.
</P>
<P>
   - After the cheese has been eaten, a crusty, burned layer will
remain in the pot. This is considered the highlight of the meal by
the Swiss, who award the most-esteemed guest with the treat or
divide it among all the diners.
</P>
<P>
   - There are dippers that are sure to be hits, and then those
that will be more of a near-miss. When making the classic Swiss
cheese fondue, make sure you're armed with plenty of crusty loaves.
Chicken and asparagus are nice ideas, but there's a reason the
Swiss tried bread first. Keep a loaf of rye on hand, as well. It's
one of our favorites. The Melting Pot restaurant in Scottsdale
serves sliced Granny Smith apples with its cheese fondue _ the
result is heaven on a two-prong fork.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for chocolate. Strawberries and bananas, natch,
but cheesecake cubes will disappear fast, too. Be sure to choose a
moist poundcake if you choose one at all. Chocolate-dipped cake
isn't as good as it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   - For lazy dessert fondues, heat some caramel apple dip or
chocolate-fudge sauce in your pot. It's not quite as good, but it's
just as fun. To heat things up, add a dash of a dessert liqueur and
ignite, Cherries Jubilee-style. Serve nut-coated marshmallows as
dippers and toast them in the flames before dunking them in
chocolate. The flame will die down with stirring.
</P>
<P>
   - Be sure to color-code the dipping forks and assign each guest
a color. This will prevent mix-ups and, even worse,
saliva-swapping, for those who insist on committing the dangerous
taboo of eating straight from the hot fondue fork.
</P>
<P>
   - Along the same lines _ no double-dipping.
</P>
<P>
   - Careful, ladies. A morsel dropped in the pan means you've got
to kiss your man. And, gentlemen, the Swiss say a bottle of wine is
the penalty for slipping your bread from the fork tines. &QL;

CHEESE OR CHOCOLATE, IT'S HIP TO DIP AGAIN  
 (ART ADV: PHOTO IS BEING SENT TO NYTNS CLIENTS)

   PHOENIX - Once again, it's hip to dip.
</P>
<P>
   Fondue, the fun food that permeated parties in the '60s and
'70s, is back with the Bug, another sign of those times.
</P>
<P>
   Fondue pots are decorating the shelves at trendy kitchen shops,
and the American Dairy Association is handing out packets on the
new 'due. Even Sterno is back in stock at the stores.
</P>
<P>
   And to whom do we owe credit for the resurgence of this food
fad?
</P>
<P>
   None other than Father Time.
</P>
<P>
   David Pursglove of the Trends-Analytics Group in Washington,
D.C., tracks food fashions for a living using a tried-and-true
number-crunching system that accurately has predicted food and
drink trends since 1963. Pursglove forecast in 1994 that fondue
would be full-blown again by 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``In America, food and drink are not commodities, they're
fashion items,'' Pursglove says, ``and fashions run in cycles.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, where have we heard this before?
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, if you give a standout long enough, it's going to
come back,'' said Matt Kandl of Le Creuset, one of many cookware
companies offering fondue pots.
</P>
<P>
   Take bell-bottoms, for example. Mothers everywhere were thrilled
earlier this decade when their teen daughters pulled the jeans out
of the box and begged to borrow the old bells.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, it's time to dust off the old fondue pot. Or, for that
matter, buy one for the very first time, because you, too, can do
fondue.
</P>
<P>
   Legend has it that fondue was born in 17th-century Zurich,
Switzerland, after a long, food-bare winter. Finding cheese and
bread as the only edible options, an ingenious cook melted the
former, dipped the latter and voila! Being cheesy was cool.
</P>
<P>
   Classic Swiss fondue has evolved over the years. The dish picked
up influences from neighboring Frenchmen, who christened it from
the French verb ``fondre'' (``to melt''), and arrives on tables
today much improved. Conventional cheese fondue now consists of not
one but two Swiss cheeses, a white-wine base, hints of garlic,
lemon and nutmeg, and a dash of Kirsch, a cherry brandy.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by bowls of bread, cooked chicken, fruit and
vegetables, cheese fondue is a simple meal and can be used for
effortless entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bette Kahn, a spokeswoman for kitchenware company
Crate &AMP; Barrel, this ease of use is another reason why fondue is
becoming '90s chic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is so busy now and just lives in the moment,'' she
said. ``But fondue is an in-the-moment kind of entertaining. All
you have to do is light your little flame.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost. Most fondues are made on the stove and then transferred
to portable tabletop burners, which are designed to maintain, not
attain, the desired heat. Unless your pot is electric, start on the
stove to avoid fondue frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Cheese isn't the only protein power packed into fondue.
Americans came up with the idea for boeuf bourguignon during the
first era of fondue. (Who knows why it sounds French _ maybe
``fried beef chunks,'' the gist of the dish, sounds better ``en
francais''.)
</P>
<P>
   In this version of stab-dip-eat, raw beef chunks are speared on
forks, fried in peanut oil and munched, throwing fat intake and
calorie counting to the wind. Modern improvements on this dish can
be witnessed at the Melting Pot restaurant in Scottsdale, Ariz.,
where raw beef, seafood, chicken and vegetables are served with
flavored batters, dipped first in these and then dipped again and
cooked in hot canola oil, a more healthful alternative.
</P>
<P>
   The Melting Pot also offers an even more health-conscious
cooking method for meat. Broth, flavored with bits of vegetables
and spices, does wonders for the heart and the taste buds. But it
doesn't do the same for the clock _ meat takes twice as long to
cook in the broth.
</P>
<P>
   After the meat is cooked, it can be dipped once more into
different sauces; barbecue, teriyaki, lemon-pepper and horseradish
are popular choices.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's chocolate fondue. Taste it with strawberries, and
you'll understand why they coined the term ``aphrodisiac.''
</P>
<P>
   Trend analysts insist chocolate and other dessert fondues never
really went out of style: They've just been on the back burner for
a couple of years, waiting on the menu wings to stage a
full-fledged attack.
</P>
<P>
   And the time has come, so take a stab at it. &QL;

Classic Swiss Three-Cheese Fondue
</P>
<P>

   Classic Chocolate Fondue
</P>
<P>
   (From ``Fondue,'' by Rick Rodgers)
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   12 ounces high quality bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped

   1 to 2 tablespoons cognac, brandy or liqueur

 DRUG COVERAGE IS THE RIGHT PRESCRIPTION FOR MEDICARE

 Includes a 250-word sidebar 
 By BETSY McCAUGHEY ROSS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    ``Some seniors are too embarrassed to tell me they can't afford
their medications,'' says Dr. Robert Braham, a New York internist.
``For patients on Medicare, paying for drugs is the overwhelming
problem.''
 &HT;    It's especially dangerous for those suffering from hypertension,
a time bomb of a disease with no warning signs. They try to get
along on one pill a day instead of their prescribed three, and
nothing seems to go wrong. Then suddenly they have a stroke or a
heart attack.
 &HT;    John, a patient in his 70s, stopped taking his hypertension
medication because of its cost. The result was a stroke that left
him without speech or the use of his right arm. The drug,
Lisinopril, costs $30 a month. His hospital bill was $10,000.
 &HT;    ``It's foolish,'' Braham says.
 &HT;    And not only for patients, but for taxpayers as well: Medicare
doesn't cover prescriptions, but when patients go without them and
land in the hospital, Medicare pays the bills.
 &HT;    Congress needs to guarantee seniors prescription drugs with an
affordable co-payment. It is the most cost-effective health
coverage: Every dollar spent on pharmaceuticals saves, on average,
$2.10 in other kinds of health care, according to a nationwide
study by Frank Lichtenberg, a professor at the Columbia Graduate
School of Business in New York.
 &HT;    The need for prescription coverage is all the more pressing in
light of the almost daily pharmaceutical breakthroughs that are
keeping patients out of hospitals and off operating tables.
 &HT;    From 1977 to 1987, for example, new H2-antagonist drugs led to
80 percent fewer operations for ulcers. The drugs cost only $900 a
year, compared to the $28,000 average for surgery.
 &HT;    Recently scientists discovered that most ulcers are caused not
by stress but by bacteria, meaning that antibiotics can eliminate
ulcers in almost all cases, rendering surgery unnecessary.
Currently, however, Medicare will pay for the operation but not for
the drugs.
 &HT;    The U.S. outstrips the rest of the world in health spending, but
we lag behind most industrialized countries in the proportion of
our health spending that goes to pharmaceutical products. Less than
10 percent of American health expenditures go for pharmaceuticals,
half the percentage devoted by Japan.
 &HT;    Medicine has changed since Medicare was established in 1965,
with pharmaceuticals leading the way. Medicare has not changed with
it, however, leaving some seniors literally forced to choose
between medications and groceries.
 &HT;    The need for funding of prescription drugs is particularly
apparent in treating cardiovascular disease, which afflicts 70
percent of elderly Americans. A stream of new medications has
lowered mortality and treatment costs. ACE inhibitors alone can
save $3,000 a year for a patient with congestive heart failure,
mostly by reducing hospitalization.
 &HT;    Similarly, anticoagulants _ blood thinners _ are protecting
stroke victims from debilitating recurrences. Strokes are the
largest reason seniors become disabled. The lifetime cost of a
severe stroke exceeds $100,000, including hospital, rehabilitation
and nursing-home costs. The average annual cost of drug therapy is
only $1,095. It's a bargain for the health system, but too many
elderly can't afford it, and Medicare won't pay.
 &HT;    To get around this dilemma, seniors have been signing up with
HMOs for drug coverage. But on New Year's Day, 440,000 seniors were
dropped by their HMOs _ including Oxford, Aetna and Humana _ who
had concluded that profits on seniors were too low.
 &HT;    That makes the need for Medicare drug coverage all the more
urgent. Medicare reform is among the most pressing issues on the
national agenda _ as demonstrated by the sustained applause that
greeted President Clinton's State of the Union vow to get the job
done. A National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare is
now meeting to redesign the 33-year-old program.
 &HT;    The commission should recognize the compelling progress in drug
development and make drug coverage with affordable co-payments a
top priority.
 &HT;    The cost would be $20 billion, slightly less than 10 percent of
Medicare's budget. Some commission members say that Medicare,
facing bankruptcy, can't afford to increase benefits. The real fact
is, providing drug benefits will save money. A near-bankrupt
Medicare can't afford not to increase these benefits.
 &HT;    New Hampshire lawmakers learned this lesson the hard way: In
1981, they limited the number of prescriptions seniors could fill
under a state program. In less than a year, medication use dropped
35 percent _ but admissions to nursing homes shot up almost 60
percent. As soon as lawmakers came to their senses and removed the
limit, nursing-home admissions returned to normal and total health
costs dropped.
 &HT;    New drug developments offer the most promise for providing
cost-effective health care to the elderly and ensuring the future
solvency of Medicare.
 &HT;    HMOs have wrung some inefficiencies out of the health system,
but they have few tricks left. As they raise premiums, drop seniors
and promote mergers to increase their own market clout, they are
less and less relevant to the Medicare crisis.
 &HT;    The idea that HMOs will solve the cost problem is ``sheer
fantasy,'' admits commission member Bruce C. Vladeck, who
administered the Health Care Financing Agency from 1993 to 1997 and
oversaw Medicare.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, drug innovation proceeds at revolutionary speed. Six
weeks ago, the drug Embrel was introduced. It delays the crippling
progression of severe rheumatoid arthritis for some patients. A
total of 316 new cancer drugs are in the research pipeline.
 &HT;    There is even the prospect of treatment for Alzheimer's disease,
which with a projected 14 million suffers in the year 2010 looms as
one of the mostly costly ailments of the future. Tacrine, the first
drug to treat Alzheimer's symptoms, appeared only six years ago.
Now researchers are testing the effectiveness of
anti-inflammatories and estrogen in slowing or preventing the
disease.
 &HT;    Some members of Congress have proposed reducing the cost of drug
coverage for seniors by forcing pharmaceutical companies to sell
drugs to seniors below market price or to pay a rebate to Medicare.
 &HT;    But Congress should think twice about crippling pharmaceutical
innovation with price controls. While the National Institute of
Health and other institutions do important basic research, it's the
drug companies that transform that research into new medications
and bring them to a patient's bedside.
 &HT;    American pharmaceutical companies produce 45 percent of the
world's medication breakthroughs _ a process too crucial to
humanity's future to be lightly tampered with.
 &HT;    The Medicare commission should press Congress to provide
prescription-drug coverage for seniors, while being careful not to
adopt any quick fixes for drug costs that would slow the race for
new cures.
 &HT;    Patients shouldn't be ashamed to admit that they can't afford
medications. The real shame is that Medicare doesn't pay.

   Betsy McCaughey Ross, former lieutenant governor of New York,
redefined the debate on the Clinton health plan with her 1994
magazine article ``No Exit,'' which received the National Magazine
Award and the H.L. Mencken Award. Now Ross turns her attention to
Medicare reform, arguably the most important issue facing America
today. As the national commission on medicare prepares its
recommendations, Ross weighs in with a hard-hitting explanation of
why the commission can't afford NOT to extend Medicare coverage to
prescription drugs for seniors. (slugged:

   NY-WOJNAROWICZ (New York) _ David Wojnarowicz (1954-1992) was a
near-mythic figure in New York a decade ago, and for many people
who knew him, he still is. Artist, writer, filmmaker and performer,
he gained fame during the brief East Village art boom of the
1980's. But he kept himself outside the hype and went his own way.
He stayed in the neighborhood after the galleries had moved out,
and died there of AIDS at the age of 38. But at the moment he's
back in New York in full force. A retrospective titled ``Fever: The
Art of David Wojnarowicz'' has opened at the New Museum of
Contemporary Art in SoHo; several Manhattan galleries are showing
his work. A book of excerpts from his diaries has just appeared. By
Holland Cotter.

<P>
   BOOK-CLUBS (New York) _ Reading is an essentially solitary
activity, but talking about books requires at least two people.
Even if you live with another bibliovore, what are the chances that
you will both be struck by the desire to read and discuss, say,
``Bleak House'' or ``Ulysses'' at precisely the same moment? The
growing popularity of reading groups and book clubs attests to the
desire to talk about books as well as read them. By Bruce Shenitz.

   ELGAR (Undated) _ Americans march to Elgar at commencements as
they march to Mendelssohn at weddings, but they probably don't
think about him most of the rest of the year. To a nation with
little patience for quaint remnants, he can seem an anomalous
holdover of the British Empire, which much of his music appeared to
embody in its doughty as in brave/valiant, or dowdy, as in
unstylish? staunchness and solemnity. But Elgar deserves respect
for more than just those ``Pomp and Circumstance'' marches; some
listeners have found a core of deep humanity in his work, even
under the occasional bluster. And now, for no reason apparent in
the stars, a confluence of events has brought the composer to
attention. By James R. Oestreich.

A `HEAVEN'-LY BLEND OF INNOCENCE AND ACTION
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Children of Heaven'' is a deceptively simple
story about a little Tehran boy who loses his sister's shoes while
running an errand and then spends the next few weeks trying to find
her another pair. The movie won the Grand Prize at the 1997
Montreal Film Festival and also earned the festival's audience
award for most popular movie. It's easy to see why. The movie's
appealing blend of wide-eyed innocence and exciting action will
melt even the most jaded heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children of Heaven'' effectively continues Iran's tradition of
films about impoverished, resourceful children forced to deal with
a persistent sense of loss. Like ``The White Balloon'' and ``The
Runner,'' this movie features mostly nonprofessional actors telling
a story that is naturalistically paced with scant use of dialogue.
It works, thanks in large part to writer-director Majid Majidi's
passionate and focused screenplay and the charismatic performances
from the film's two young leads.
</P>
<P>
   Eight-year-old Ali (Mir Farrokh Hashemian) loses his little
sister's shoes when they are inadvertently picked up by a blind
peddler outside a market. Fearful of his father (Amir Naji) and
believing his family's financial situation to be dire (it is,
although the bare necessities are there), Ali begs his sister,
Zahra (Bahareh Seddiqi), to keep the bad news a secret. Meanwhile,
the children come up with a plan. Zahra will wear Ali's tennis
shoes to school in the morning and then rush home so he can run to
his classes, which begin in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement doesn't always run smoothly, such as when Zahra
has a written exam and must stay late or when she spots her lost
pair of shoes on a girl at school and proceeds to follow her home.
The fact that Ali's tennis shoes are much too big for her doesn't
help either, which is illustrated in one wonderfully filmed scene.
All of Ali's running eventually pays dividends, though, when he
hatches a plan near the film's conclusion that is as stirring as it
is satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   The saucer-eyed, pensive Farrokh is a gem of a find, genuinely
conveying dignity, joy and sadness in the role of the film's
pint-size hero. Seddiqi, playing Ali's lovable 6-year-old sister,
is also a natural, capable of showing a wide range of honest
emotions just by the smallest of expressions on her sweet little
face. Both children are emblematic of the film's message that the
joys of childhood rest in love and imagination, not material
possessions. Yes, it's a simple theme, but it's a powerful one when
beautifully told. &UR;  &QL;

`HEART' BEATS WEAKLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 2 { Stars 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There's a line in ``Playing by Heart'' that
writer-director Willard Carroll likes so much that, just in case
you missed it the first or, say, fourth time, he keeps his
characters reciting it again and again throughout the movie. It
goes something like this: ``Talking about love is like dancing
about architecture. You just can't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Use the line as a litmus test. Think it's profound? Then go
(run, don't walk!) to ``Playing by Heart.'' If you think it's kind
of clever, but consider the prospect of hearing it repeated several
times unappealing, then you might want to sift through other
entertainment options. And for those who don't like to hear people
talk ad nauseam about matters of the heart, skip this movie and go
directly to the tractor pull nearest you.
</P>
<P>
   With its vaguely interconnected love stories, ``Playing by
Heart'' is kind of a brainy ``Love, American Style'' without the
laugh track (or, for the most part, the laughs). Certainly a cast
that includes Sean Connery, Gillian Anderson, Gena Rowlands and
Madeleine Stowe promises its share of fine acting and memorable
moments. But the film fails to connect its numerous players in any
sort of meaningful way, instead giving us one static story stacked
on top of another.
</P>
<P>
   The film's 11 characters are each introduced early. We meet
Hannah (Rowlands) and Paul (Connery) a wealthy couple thrown for a
loop when Paul is diagnosed with cancer. Also confronting death are
Mildred (Ellen Burstyn) and her son Mark (Jay Mohr), who is
hospitalized, suffering the ravages of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, handsome and charming Trent (Jon Stewart) is trying
to break through the brick wall that theatrical director Meredith
(Anderson) has built around her heart. Young Keenan (Ryan
Phillippe), an L.A. club crawler, is also determined to fly solo,
much to the consternation of the vivacious Joan (Angelina Jolie).
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the lonely hearts club are sexual sophisticates and
marital adulterers Gracie (Stowe) and Roger (Anthony Edwards), as
well as Hugh (Dennis Quaid), a loner who moves from bar to bar
spinning fantastic, tragic tales of woe to total strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Filmmaker Carroll, more or less making his feature writing and
directing debut (his first movie, ``Tom's Midnight Garden,'' is
pretty much unknown), displays a flair for dialogue, but he
undercuts his good intentions with a lot of false melodrama.
Miramax Films, the studio releasing the film, has asked journalists
to respect the mystery of the film by not revealing the nature of
all its intricate relationships, but you don't have to be all that
intuitive to figure things out.
</P>
<P>
   When the guarded Meredith tells Trent that her first husband was
``gay ... but we're still friends, although I haven't seen him in a
while,'' you know you can cross Sean Connery off the list of
possibilities. And to be sure, you're engaging in this guessing
game throughout the movie because there's a natural assumption that
these characters have to intersect at some point.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly though, Carroll waits until the movie is nearly over
to make this happen. In the meantime, the movie flits from one
story to the next and then back again (all to the accompaniment of
composer John Barry's ``Dance With Wolves'' retread score), often
derailing any momentum the narrative has picked up.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly enough, in this all-star cast of veterans, it's
the relative newcomers Jolie (``Gia,'' ``George Wallace'') and
Phillipe who command the most attention. They are so good as the
passionate young lovers that it's disappointing whenever the film
leaves their story and moves on to something that's not nearly as
interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Also compelling: a wizened one-eyed cat belonging to Jolie and a
175-pound mastiff owned by Anderson. They could have made an
interesting couple, too, but then that would have been ``The Truth
About Cats and Dogs,'' another lonely-hearts movie, albeit one that
was a little more successful in engaging its audience. &QL;

ARREST THOSE CLICHES IN `TURKS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Just when you thought the Irish trend had
faded from television this season, there comes a whiff of police
blarney from CBS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turks'' (9 p.m. EST Thursdays, check local listings) stars
William Devane, which immediately gives it that second-look
potential because, hey, it's Big Bill Devane, great American actor.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the problem facing not only this show, but all Irish
shows and not coincidentally, all cop shows: Cliches.
</P>
<P>
   Do they have to be cops? Maybe they can just be Irish and not be
a big sprawling family that likes to drink beers and uphold the law
in a major city (this time Chicago).
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's being too harsh, given this was the Year of the
Irish, capped by NBC's ``Trinity,'' which tried to cram so many
stereotypes into the first hour that it was painful.
</P>
<P>
   That aside, ``Turks'' has a bigger problem. The cop genre is
played out. In a season where HBO's ``The Sopranos'' broke new
ground by reinventing the mob story, cops-on-TV reeks of
familiarity and failure. It may be that with established shows like
``NYPD Blue'' and ``Homicide: Life on the Street,'' or even ``Law &AMP;
Order,'' the proverbial bar is just raised too high for newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turks'' is about the overwhelming presence of police sergeant
Joseph Turk (Devane), his follow-in-the-footsteps cop sons, Mike
Turk (David Cubitt) and Joey Turk Jr. (Matthew Armstrong). And Paul
Turk (Michael Muhney), who chooses academia but has a disastrous
gambling problem that pushes him to the wrong side of the law.
</P>
<P>
   This is all very familiar territory. Toss in Joe's bitterly
neglected wife who can't stand making another dinner that goes cold
(Helen Carey), and Mike's increasingly bitter wife (Sarah Trigger),
who's concerned that he's ignoring his family duties, and you have
just completed the Six Degrees of Cop Show Separation rather
successfully.
</P>
<P>
   That said, ``Turks'' has potential. The acting here is good all
the way around. What drags the show down just when it starts to get
moving is consistently contrived writing. This may be exactly the
show CBS is looking for because it's safe and inviting with just
that veneer of dangerous action.
</P>
<P>
   The network was way, way over its head with the brilliant,
short-lived ``EZ Streets'' and ``Turks'' plays out as ``EZ Streets
Very Light.''
</P>
<P>
   As NBC has found out with ``Providence,'' a show riddled with
ridiculous moments and heavy-handed writing can do just fabulously
in the ratings. So do not count out ``Turks'' as a player, given
that there are not that many midseason shows and even fewer dramas
in that lot.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Turks'' takes a lot of forgiveness to truly digest. The
close-knit Irish family thing really gets out of hand when the sons
live a couple of doors from the father and one son lives in the
basement of another.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that ``Turks'' doesn't have its moments. But if it
limps along with cop cliches and tired scenarios, how can it
effectively compete against ``NYPD Blue'' and others.
</P>
<P>
   CBS already gave up on ``EZ Streets'' and ``Brooklyn South,''
both of them far superior to ``Turks.'' Perhaps the network is
putting its emphasis on the Irish family in ``Turks'' as a way to
downplay the cop-work. What happens instead, however, is that now
we have two tired formulas in one show.
</P>
<P>
   Devane's acting helps, but the writing needs to get great in a
hurry. Maybe the bigger question is this: Even then, would it be
enough? Could it be that, with precious few exceptions, the cop
genre is creatively dead, and ``Turks,'' while not the worst of the
lot in the last five or 10 years, will be remembered as the last
dance?

MAKING THE RIGHT CHOICES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dear Academy voters:
</P>
<P>
   As the Oscar nomination season begins in earnest with Sunday's
Golden Globe Awards ceremony, I just wanted all of you to know that
I have every confidence you'll make the right, honorable choices.
</P>
<P>
   While 1998 may not have been an all-time great movie year, it
certainly produced a larger-than-usual number of very good films.
And if the 3,871 prediction stories I've seen since Christmas are
correct in their consensus, such worthy efforts as ``Saving Private
Ryan,'' ``The Truman Show,'' ``Shakespeare in Love,'' ``Life Is
Beautiful,'' ``Elizabeth,'' ``Pleasantville,'' ``Affliction'' and
``Rushmore'' are high on all your lists.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of how the Globes pan out on Sunday, I'm sure
independent thinkers such as yourselves won't let them unduly
influence your high personal standards. And any of you considering
making the Hollywood Foreign Press Association your Oscar guides,
remember: they nominated an unmistakable action movie, ``Mask of
Zorro,'' in their musical/comedy category.
</P>
<P>
   The academy, of course, would never make such embarrassing
gaffes. Which speaks to the wisdom of not even having a
musical/comedy category that, let's face it, could confuse people
who possess even the best of taste.
</P>
<P>
   But I digress. I know I can count on you guys to see through
``The Thin Red Line's'' artsy hooey, despite all of the reviews
you've dutifully read that excuse its indulgent incoherence as
``poetic.'' (Side note to fellow critics: There is such a thing as
bad poetry. Jewel's book is deeper than Terrence Malick's
disembodied monologues.)
</P>
<P>
   I'm also satisfied that, despite your organization's traditional
appreciation of cancer, you'll recognize that the caricatured roles
Meryl Streep played in ``One True Thing'' and Susan Sarandon
essayed in ``Stepmom'' were among the least distinguished of their
usually admirable careers, terminal or not.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, I trust your judgment. One teensy, tiny little
concern, though. With all the slam dunks and designated dark horses
that are now all but locked into nominations, some equally fine
work is bound to be overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   So please consider this humble list of suggestions for one _
just one, nothing too daunting _ entry in each of the major
categories that you might not yet have seen or read the Variety ad
for.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, I don't expect all of them to be announced in the wee
hours of Feb. 9. I just want you to think about them before you
nominate.
</P>
<P>
   Or, by God, just think.
</P>
<P>
   BEST PICTURE &QC;
</P>
<P>
   There are good reasons why ``Bulworth'' isn't as thorough an
artistic success as ``Private Ryan,'' ``Truman'' or even
``Shakespeare.'' Warren Beatty's political satire is messy and
narcissistically imbalanced (though purposely so); it managed to
both advocate worn-out liberal bromides and offend large portions
of the African-American community at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Bulworth'' did something no American movie has managed in
years: it captured the absurd essence of the political year in
which it appeared. While ``Wag the Dog'' and ``Primary Colors''
were remarkably prescient in their specifics, ``Bulworth''
reflected the much larger, system-wide meltdown of sense in
government. Sure, it's partially an accident of timing, but even
that makes Beatty the most socially attuned director since Robert
Altman released his masterpiece ``Nashville'' in 1975. ``Bulworth''
is 1998 in celluloid form.
</P>
<P>
   BEST ACTRESS &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The good but overused arguments for Cameron Diaz are A) comedy
is in many ways harder than drama, and it's about time the academy
got over its corset queen and cancer mom fetishes; B) the New York
Film Critics Circle gave her their best actress award, and, despite
the fact that they live in New York, they're not completely nuts;
and C) boy, was she a good sport.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most persuasive reason for a ``There's Something
About Mary'' nomination, though, is that there's something about
Cameron. As the film's universal object of affection, she displayed
a rare combination of acting chops and movie star charisma. And
that, not its state-of-the-art grossout comedy, was the secret of
``Mary's'' unexpected mega-success. Look again and you'll marvel at
how very little sex has to do with Diaz's irresistible appeal.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BEST ACTOR &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Billy Bob Thornton has the showier role in ``A Simple Plan,''
and he plays it with heart-ripping, award-worthy poignance. But
Bill Paxton has a bigger load to haul in this snowy slice of
country noir. In doing so, he not only provides crucial support for
Thornton's supporting actor turn; he registers one of the smartest,
subtlest portrayals of moral collapse ever filmed.
</P>
<P>
   Watch closely as the actor registers his character's appalled
self-realization of his own craven selfishness _ and how he's too
``well-adjusted'' to lose his cool over it. As the smarter,
supposedly saner half of the film's doomed brother act, Paxton
creates, piece by judicious piece, the personal hell of a good guy
discovering that he doesn't want to finish last, and is capable of
anything to ensure that.
</P>
<P>
   SUPPORTING ACTRESS &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Keener has long been the thinking person's Parker
Posey, an actress whose fierce, honest intelligence has redeemed
many a cutsie-poo indie. There is nothing cute about ``Your Friends
&AMP; Neighbors,'' and it clearly could not have pleased Keener more.
The gusto with which she plays the film's nastiest female _ a woman
who unapologetically has time for only her own gratification, and a
tongue that lacerates anyone who impedes that goal _ is strangely
exhilarating. The example she sets in a film universe still
dominated by bad boys and romantic fallacies is as admirable as it
is alarming.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SUPPORTING ACTOR &QC;
</P>
<P>
   There was no fuller, funnier, freakier characterization last
year than John Goodman's in ``The Big Lebowski.'' He played a
philosophical, ridiculously well-groomed, religiously observant
Vietnam vet whose overrational approach to everything barely
disguised near-psychotic impatience. A one-of-a-kind role, for sure
(the Coen Brothers actually wrote the film for the actor), but
Goodman enhanced it with every little choice of timing, emphasis
and beard-trimming he made.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
DIRECTOR &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Even the trade paper ads for ``Gods and Monsters'' employ a
train motif, emphasizing how the Little Indie That Could has hauled
Ian McKellen to the front of the best actor race and given Lynn
Redgrave a good shot at a supporting actress nod. But director Bill
Condon is being criminally overlooked by most prognosticators, when
he should at the very least be celebrated for guiding some of the
year's greatest performances.
</P>
<P>
   More than that, Condon compellingly matched a variety of film
styles with the movie's diverse themes, then deftly wove the
complex elements together at the film's resonant climax. And, oh
yeah, he found the most unique of tones for the piece, and
sustained it _ if that's not directing at its best, you may as well
just give the award to Jim Cameron again.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ADAPTED SCREENPLAY &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The story wasn't so hot, but the storytelling in ``Smoke
Signals'' was absolutely marvelous. Adapted by Sherman Alexie from
a collection of his short fiction, the script employed the
traditional American Indian art of talk story to create tales and
dialogue like we've never heard before in the movies. Words rarely
have counted for so much in what is increasingly becoming a
post-verbal medium.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY &QC;
</P>
<P>
   As visually pleasing as 1998's strong suite of animated features
was, it was the thoroughly grown-up wit of ``Antz'' that arguably
advanced the form more than anything else. Sticking slippery
Freudianisms, Marxist mutterings and a mountain of sharp social
satire into the CGI anthill, the DreamWorks wags reassured us that,
no matter how technologically unreal filmmaking gets, the human
element can always endure by way of clever writing.

DIFRANCO: LESS ROCK, MORE ROLL
</HEADLINE>

By JAMES HAMES  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
ANI DiFRANCO/``Up Up Up Up Up Up'' (Righteous Babe)
<TEXT>
<P>
   Funk-folk diva DiFranco is still evolving after all these years.
Here, her sound has gotten more crisp yet not overly clean; it's
less dense yet still deep _ less rock more roll. DiFrancophones
need not be alarmed. Ani remains sweet and savory, sexy and smart.
She has not settled down as much as settled in. The early DiFranco
signature was big chords, strummed full and fast. On last year's
``Little Plastic Castle'' her sound expanded to include horns. On
``Up,'' there's the occasional banjo and Wurlitzer organ.
</P>
<P>
   As boppy as the songs are, they remain idea-centric. The
tendency of contemporary folk is for it to go straight to the
heart, missing the head completely, with songs you've memorized
before they're done. No danger of that here. ``Angel Food'' is a
spicy innuendo. ``'Tis of Thee'' and ``Trickle Down'' cover
political ground. ``Virtue'' speaks of irony: ``Virtue is relative
at best/ There's nothing worse than a sunset/ If you're driving due
west.'' ``Angry Anymore'' is about growth, ostensibly hers, and may
suggest why there's less roar here. As the title tune declares
``She's trying to sing just enough/ so the air around her moves/
and make music like mercy/ that gives what it is/ and has nothing
to prove.'' Buy it. 3 Stars. &QL;

POSTER INSPIRATION CLEAR AS A BELL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB McCARTHY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When Arnold Schwartzman sat down to design this
year's Academy Awards poster, he heard bells. So he drew them.
</P>
<P>
   In his native Britain, the loud and joyous tolling of bells has
accompanied celebrations, from the end of world wars to the birth
of a new king. The graphic artist was struck by the connection
between the bells and the academy's celebrated move to Sunday night
for its worldwide telecast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It worked out nicely that in each of the words _ SUNDAY, AT
and OSCAR _ there is the letter A that seemed to fit the
configuration of a bell,'' said Schwartzman, who has created the
commemorative poster for the third consecutive year. ``I also felt
the Oscar statuette itself was very much the configuration of a
bell's clapper, so I thought of using a bell with an Oscar clapper
to create the feeling of announcement and celebration.''
</P>
<P>
   His design can be seen on 43,000 posters being distributed to
theaters, video stores and sponsors of the 71st annual Academy
Awards telecast. Oscar night will be March 21 at the Dorothy
Chandler Pavilion at the Los Angeles Music Center.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartzman's talent for visual presentation doesn't stop there.
He is a filmmaker as well, having won an Oscar in 1982 for his
documentary feature ``Genocide,'' and past chairman of the British
Academy of Film and Television Arts. He's also a member of the
Documentary Awards Executive Committee for the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   IN VAN GOGH'S SHOES: It's hard to beat Los Angeles for the sheer
number of celebrity sightings here, and you can add Vincent van
Gogh to the latest list.
</P>
<P>
   Sure he's been dead for more than a century, but the Dutchman's
collection temporarily on loan from its permanent museum home in

NO NEED TO RUSH TO BUY, RENT `HOUR'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Should you rush out to buy or rent ``Rush Hour''
when it comes on video next week? It's hard to believe that this
action buddy movie generated more than $100 million in business and
talk of a sequel.
</P>
<P>
   First, in terms of stunts, it's not even one of Jackie Chan's
better movies. Second, Chris Tucker seems extremely limited as a
comic. But somehow this combination turned into a lethal weapon at
the box office, thanks in part to repeat business from teen boys.
</P>
<P>
   Which in a way answers the initial question. If you are looking
for a decent drive-in movie for an at-home Saturday night, ``Rush
Hour'' is a decent diversion as long as you put your critical
faculties away for the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Teens probably thought Tucker was funny in this story of an LAPD
detective assigned to assist his Hong Kong counterpart, Chan, in
retrieving a kidnapped little girl. Actually, Tucker was assigned
to Chan to keep him out of the way of the real investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker is like the class clown, funny in that he doesn't know
when to shut up, made crazier with his high, piercing voice. But I
find that a little Tucker goes a long way, and there is little more
to his humor than his mannerisms. For this film, you might be able
to tolerate him.
</P>
<P>
   Chan, on the other hand, is always watchable _ as long as he's
in the action. Beware, ``Rush Hour'' puts him in some of the most
awful maudlin scenes. And unfortunately, Chan, in his 40s is
starting to slow down, but his stunts are still remarkable. And if
someone in Hollywood can figure out how to use him, the charming
Hong Kong star could have a successful career in this town. ``Rush
Hour,'' even with its drawbacks, is a step in the right direction,
emphasizing his comic talents. So, if ``Rush Hour'' sounds like
fun, go rent it or buy it, but I wouldn't rush.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, this weekend you can check out some pretty
decent indie films recently released on video.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love and Death on Long Island'' sports a wonderfully nuanced
performance by John Hurt as a fussy middle-age British writer who
hasn't quite come to grips with the present. It is based on
novelist Gilbert Adair's book, a semi-satirical takeoff on Thomas
Mann's ``Death in Venice,'' the story of a writer who, while on
holiday in Venice, becomes enamored of a beautiful young boy.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Long Island,'' Hurt plays Giles De'Ath, who becomes
obsessed with an American teen idol, Ronnie Bostock (Jason
Priestley). In both stories, the objects of the writers' affection
are unattainable, but unlike Mann's repressed hero, Giles is able
to use the experience to free himself from his own restraints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buffalo 66'' is one of those offbeat films that you either buy
into or hate. Directed by Vince Gallo, it's the story of Billy
Brown (Gallo) who after being released from prison kidnaps a
student from tap-dancing class, Layla (a blond, tarted-up Christina
Ricci). Threatening to kill her if she doesn't do what he says, he
has her pose as his wife for his parents (Anjelica Huston and Ben
Gazzara), who live in a suburb of Buffalo, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Being from a suburb of Buffalo myself, the weirdness that ensues
does not seem preposterous. At Billy's house, Dad doesn't speak and
Mom watches a tape of an old Buffalo Bills game. Bill has been
named for the team, and there are photos of O.J. Simpson and Jack
Kemp on the wall. ``Buffalo 66'' isn't a great film but it takes
some chances and in doing so is often entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Return to Paradise'' is about three Americans (David Conrad,
Vince Vaughn, Joaquin Phoenix) who get involved in drugs while in
Malaysia. Two of them manage to leave the country, but Lewis
(Phoenix) is arrested. Two years later, his attorney (Anne Heche)
contacts the other two to tell them that if they don't return and
face charges, Lewis will be executed for drug trafficking. A
compelling moral dilemma ensues. &QL;

ROCK BAND STICKS WITH ITS NAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When ex-Mercury Records chairman Danny Goldberg
got wind of this band's handle, he reportedly responded: ``Great
name!''
</P>
<P>
   Others weren't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   Until Atlanta's hard-rocking Nashville Pussy got nominated for a
best metal performance Grammy Award the other week for the
quartet's raucous track, ``Fried Chicken and Coffee,'' some media
outlets were feeling a bit, well, gun-shy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many newspapers actually can and do print our name,''
explained singer-guitarist Blaine Cartwright. ``It's only in small
towns where it presents a problem. Everyone at Mercury who signed
us understands and it's been no problem. We consider it a small
uphill battle. There's more to us than just the name, anyway, and
nobody has ever suggested changing it. It's a name where everyone
who hears it remembers it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nashville has long enjoyed a fearsome reputation for
over-the-top club dates that include fire-spitting, hard drinking
and four-on-the-floor rock 'n' roll that recalls AC/DC, Ted Nugent
and the Stooges.
</P>
<P>
   The band's raw and blistering debut disc, produced by the
Fastbacks' Kurt Bloch, was initially issued last February by
Minneapolis indie Amphetamine Reptile before Mercury picked it up
after the record sold 30,000 copies without national distribution _
a sales figure considered ``gold'' among indie labels.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Nashville had earned a reputation as one of the
most refreshing no-nonsense hard-rock groups of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't mean to be sexually offensive,'' said Cartwright, who
formed the band after quitting the Athens, Ga.-based Nine Pound
Hammer. ``We live in our own little world and have to find ways to
entertain ourselves. I lived in Nashville and there's two women in
the band and the name just fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with Cartwright, the band includes his wife, lead
guitarist Ruyter Suys, 6-foot-3-inch fire-breathing Amazonian
bassist Corey Parks and drummer Jeremy Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been on the road forever, and our humor is always very
crude,'' Cartwright, 34, explained. ``After so long, you get down
to a total base level. We all swear a lot, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Reviews for Nashville's fast and furious debut have been
universally great while club dates throughout the country almost
always sell out.
</P>
<P>
   The group took an old-school approach to the music biz by
touring and touring and touring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody in this band does anything they don't like,''
Cartwright said. ``We all want to go full throttle. We're on the
road nonstop and there's no home life besides the van.'' &QL;

DEPRESSING `PARADISE' IS, WELL, DEPRESSING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One hundred one minutes is a long time to sit with the deadbeat
characters in ``Another Day In Paradise,'' but fortunately director
Larry Clark doesn't employ the voyeuristic, subversive and
exploitative documentary style he used in ``Kids'' or in his
photography exhibitions of disenfranchised, drug-addled youths.
</P>
<P>
   Taken from the novel by ex-con Eddie Little, the film is a
throwback to gritty, downer movies of the '60s and '70s such as
``Midnight Cowboy'' and ``Bonnie and Clyde.''
</P>
<P>
   It also strongly resembles Gus Van Sant's ``Drugstore Cowboy''
as its drug addict ``heroes'' are losers who think they're smarter
than the rest of the world _ and, in the end, that arrogance causes
wrong decisions to be made and their botched jobs to erupt into
violence.
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of terrific performances in the film, from
James Woods (who also produced) as Mel and Melanie Griffith as Sid,
who hitch up with a young teenage couple, Bobbie (Vincent
Kartheiser) and Rosie (Natasha Gregson Wagner).
</P>
<P>
   They form a family, with Mel playing the abusive, ill-tempered
father, and Sid the savvy, sweet-natured mom. And they rob
pharmacies and jewelry stores and just about anything that will
enable them to make a big score and continue shooting up junk.
</P>
<P>
   But things begin to go a little haywire after Mel and Bobbie
underestimate some redneck racists who are purchasing pills. In a
freakish turn of events, Mel is shot and Bobbie is beaten to a
pulp. The happy family begins to fray when Bobbie questions Mel's
decisions and Mel begins to act as violently and badly as the real
father Bobbie left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Clark does a better job when he doesn't have a personal
investment in the material and, to his credit, he doesn't
romanticize or glamorize this quartet of lost souls. Sid even tells
Mel, who is taking his role as head of the family too seriously,
``We're just a couple of junkies and thieves.''
</P>
<P>
   And though Woods has made a career out of playing scary
characters, he manages to imbue Mel with a sense of the pathetic.
But it's Griffith who tackles the most ambiguous part with gusto,
making Sid the nurturer, brains and strength of the gang. She is as
tender as she is tough.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its strong acting, the real question remains, do we
really need another depressing movie about junkies, thieves and
lost souls? Though Clark downplays the violence, ``Another Day In
Paradise'' has nothing new to say or show. This paradise turns out
to be hell on earth, hardly a surprise considering the scores of
similar movies that have issued the same cautionary warning.
</P>
<P>
   Another Day In Paradise. Directed by Larry Clark. Written by
Christopher Landon and Stephen Chin. Cast: James Woods, Melanie
Griffith, Vincent Kartheiser, Natasha Gregson Wagner. Trimark

UNREALISTIC SITUATIONS MAKE `PLAYING BY HEART' SKIP A BEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Playing By Heart'' is a movie that could have been designed by a
computer to appeal to all segments of the great American public in
this era of ever-shorter attention spans.
</P>
<P>
   It follows no less than 11 Los Angeles characters over a period
of eight days _ each of whom is involved in a romantic relationship
in some stage of formation, disintegration or renewal. (``Talking
about love is as futile as dancing about architecture,'' a
character says, but the movie tries anyway.)
</P>
<P>
   For the old-timers, there's the long and successful marriage of
Hannah (Gena Rowlands), the star of a PBS cooking show, and her
manager Paul (Sean Connery), which begins to unravel when Hannah
stumbles upon what appears to be an 20-year-old incidence of
adultery.
</P>
<P>
   For the thirtysomethings, there's the sexless, dead marriage of
Hugh (Dennis Quaid), a video-game designer, and Gracie (Madeleine
Stowe), who's in the midst of a ``Last Tango in Paris''-style
affair with a minister (Anthony Edwards).
</P>
<P>
   Also in this demographic bracket is the stumbling first steps of
a maybe-romance between Trent (Jon Stewart), a 38-year-old
architect, and Meredith (Gillian Anderson), a stage director who
has been frigid since her childhood sweetheart/first husband turned
out to be gay.
</P>
<P>
   For Generation X and younger, there's the curious, enigmatic,
off-and-on maneuvering between Joan (Angelina Jolie), a
big-hearted-bimbo, and Keenan (Ryan Phillippe), a young man of
mystery she finds one night dancing by himself in a trendy disco.
</P>
<P>
   And for a special dash of poignancy bridging all ages and
orientations, there's the estranged mother-son relationship of
Mildred (Ellen Burstyn) and Mark (Jay Mohr), which is finally
reaching toward absolution as he's in the last stages of dying from
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Willard Carroll moves around between these
stories at a fast, if not quite MTV, pace; alternating his mood
between the humorously cute and the gushily poignant; framing his
stories in ravishing visuals (photographed by the legendary Vilmos
Zigsmond) to one of John Barry's more restrained scores.
</P>
<P>
   The first half of the film is rather pedestrian and soap
operatic, and constantly reminds us that Alan Rudolph handles this
kind of multi-character vignette movie better. It picks up
considerably in its second half, however, and the various strands
are resolved and tied together in a rather tidy way (perhaps too
tidy for credibility.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, the movie smacks of a certain old-fashioned Hollywood
phoniness. Not one of these 11 characters is afflicted with what
marriage counselors claim is the number-one destroyer of all
marriages and romances: money problems. They all seem to be
wealthy, drive expensive cars, live in mansions or stunning view
apartments. No wonder everything end up so happily for them.
</P>
<P>
   Playing By Heart. Directed and written by Willard Carroll. Cast:
Gillian Anderson, Ellen Burstyn, Sean Connery, Dennis Quaid, Gena
Rowlands, Angelina Jolie, Jay Mohr, Anthony Edwards. Miramax. 121
minutes. Rated R for sexual situations.

ROMANCE CLICKS IN `PLAYING BY HEART' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB FENSTER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Hollywood struggles to find true romance, missing the
chemistry more often than finding stars who click. If the audience
doesn't buy into a film's big romance, there goes the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing by Heart'' circumvents that dilemma by offering us
multiple romances. If you don't tip to two or three of the love
stories, there's an additional four or five likely to wrap you up.
And because the script is witty, sophisticated and very LA,
``Playing by Heart'' clicks much more than it misses.
</P>
<P>
   The movie rotates through rapid vignettes among various lovers,
would-be lovers, cheaters and losers _ all of whom seem to have
nothing in common except that they're living in LA. They're trying
to start romances or end them, avoid them or fix them. The main
stories:
</P>
<P>
   _Joan (Angelina Jolie), an aggressive actress in hot pursuit of
Keenan (Ryan Phillippe), the disco phantom with a secret.
</P>
<P>
   _Meredith (Gillian Anderson), a theater director who doesn't
have the stamina or tolerance for a relationship, particularly when
she meets Trent (Jon Stewart), who is too tempting.
</P>
<P>
   _Hugh (Dennis Quaid), a drunk who spends his nights in bars
telling different women different stories.
</P>
<P>
   _Paul (Sean Connery) and Hannah (Gena Rowlands), who have been
married for 40 years and are in a sudden hurry to work out their
relationship problems.
</P>
<P>
   Writer/director Willard Carroll (``The Runestone'') leads us
around the romantic carousel in lilting fashion. He tells their
stories in satiny moments, each one neatly wrapped with a punch
line or surprise revelation.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the disparate people start to connect in unusual
ways that give the film added dimensions and provide the audience
with the fun of playing a guessing game with the filmmaker: What
exactly is he up to?
</P>
<P>
   None of these love stories would make a strong enough center for
a single-romance movie. But because the movie has no center, just
an engaging rondelet, they all work. The cumulative effect reaches
an emotional pitch that most star romances don't come close to.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll's script is dense with banter and the barbs of modern
romance, with punch lines that are sharper than the film's brief
attempts at serious analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, ``Playing by Heart'' has more sweetness and sadness
than happiness or passion, but you don't feel cheated on any
account.
</P>
<P>
   Standouts among the ensemble cast: Jolie (who starred in the TV
movie ``Gia'') and Phillippe (``54''). Jolie's energy and humor
keep the film from growing maudlin, while Phillippe proves that the
flash of talent he displayed in the mess of ``54'' was real.
</P>
<P>
   It's particularly nice to see Connery in a non-Connery role,
notably without guns, flying dragons or umbrellas as props, just
his feelings and his humor.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Playing by Heart'' will probably attract more women
than men, it's a good date movie. With so many stories interlacing,
there's something here for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Rated R for profanity, ``Playing by Heart'' contains no sex or
nudity. 4 stars. &QL;

 &HT;    Q: Who will be the half-dozen most important people in the year
2010? What will be the half-dozen most important products in the
year 2010?
 &HT;    ___ Amy Bruhnheil, Brussels
 &HT;    
 &HT;    A: If importance is defined by global political impact, the most
important people in the year 2010 will be those leaders whose
constituency is truly the world at large. In the digital era,
separate nation-states, with isolating boundaries, are less
important than leadership or governance that is both more local and
more global.
 &HT;    Today we know how to be more local. In many countries, more and
more decisionmaking is being pushed into the community. But we are
almost clueless about working at the global level because 1) there
is no clear constituency of people to please and 2) our current
global organizations exist as bureaucracies in favor of consensus,
not leadership. Yet those leaders who can rise above the confines
of the nation-state will be the most important.
 &HT;    Addendum: It goes without saying that humanity is faced with a
handful of scientific challenges, which, if met, would position the
inventor as heroic. The list of ``most important people'' would
surely include anybody who cured AIDS, invented teleportation or
discovered an organism that ate air and sea pollution and excreted
pure oxygen.
 &HT;    As to important products, these are in the eye of the beholder.
Some people might consider a toaster that won't burn bread to be
vital. On a world level, we probably all agree that non-polluting
cars; low-cost, low-earth-orbiting satellites; and perfectly safe
airplanes would be major new products.
 &HT;    My more idiosyncratic list would include batteries (1/100th the
size and 100 times the capacity), ubiquitous wireless
communications and computers with common sense.
 &HT;    We underestimate the need for products to improve power
management. Just look at the spaghetti of cords and AC adapters you
have, witness the enormous proportion of weight and size of
batteries in cellphones and electric cars, and consider the
potential impact of wireless power distribution (if we could invent
it). We are doing better and better at consuming less power in the
digital world, but the physical world is far less flexible.
 &HT;    The field of wireless communication today is compartmentalized,
inconsistent and unreliable. Think of a scale that goes from the
handy remote-control unit of your television (i.e., near-field
wireless communications) to global satellite systems. The challenge
is to make our wireless world seamless. In so doing, we will have
to have far more compatible systems that can talk to each other
regardless of where we are in the world or how far away on the
scale.
 &HT;    Digital common sense is the highest on my list. If computers in
2010 could have the common sense of an 8-year-old child, the world
would be a better place. The human interface with computers is in
part driven by the quality of the computer's sensory means, those
for both expression and recognition.
 &HT;    But in much greater part, the quality of the interface is driven
by the computer's intelligence. No more dumb error messages, no
more standstill because of typos, no more mistakes because the
computer ``did what I said vs. what I meant.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Not long ago, malls devastated downtown shopping areas;; is
it possible the expected surge in e-commerce might make malls
obsolete?
 &HT;    ___ Eduardo Salazar, Madrid
 &HT;    
 &HT;    A: Without question. Malls as we know them will become obsolete
as a means to sell the products that people know they want. Malls
will become the means to browse, the places to meet people and the
centers for location-based entertainment. Mall owners and tenants
need to reinvent their own magnetism, which in the future will be
more like the attraction of theme parks than street shops. If mall
owners and tenants are complacent, they will become little more
than indoor advertising: a place where people go to browse and take
notes _ while they buy later over the Net.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What approach would you take to getting a technophobe to sit
down at a computer screen?
 &HT;    ___ P. Vance, New York City
 &HT;    
 &HT;    A: Keep in mind that technophobia is not unjustified _ computers
have become far too complex and using them far too humiliating. In
almost all cases, the worst path to enlightenment is to go to a
school. The classroom is just the wrong setting for a technophobe,
who needs to feel first and foremost that this new skill is about
life, not computers.
 &HT;    After a certain age, people are either too busy to learn or they
feel ``why bother; after all, I've lived without computers so
far.'' The key to changing this attitude is to show the value of
cyber-skill.
 &HT;    Examples include the value gained by authors from word
processing, parents from e-mail to kids and researchers from the
Web. Increasingly, consumers and businesses alike are learning that
the Internet provides huge conveniences and cost savings over faxes
and telephoning.
 &HT;    Once clear reasons have been established as to why it's a good
idea to ``bother,'' the next step is to provide a soft landing on
the otherwise hostile terrain of the digital world. In some cases,
this is best done through the charisma of children as teachers _
especially when the students are grandparents. In some cases, it is
best done by peer groups.
 &HT;    History will look back upon our era as a cruel period, one that
forced people into a sense of ignominy through no fault of their
own. Keep reminding the technophobe of this.

 &HT;    Q: Who will be the half-dozen most important people in the year
2010? What will be the half-dozen most important products in the
year 2010?
 &HT;    ___ Amy Bruhnheil, Brussels
 &HT;    
 &HT;    A: If importance is defined by global political impact, the most
important people in the year 2010 will be those leaders whose
constituency is truly the world at large. In the digital era,
separate nation-states, with isolating boundaries, are less
important than leadership or governance that is both more local and
more global.
 &HT;    Today we know how to be more local. In many countries, more and
more decisionmaking is being pushed into the community. But we are
almost clueless about working at the global level because 1) there
is no clear constituency of people to please and 2) our current
global organizations exist as bureaucracies in favor of consensus,
not leadership. Yet those leaders who can rise above the confines
of the nation-state will be the most important.
 &HT;    Addendum: It goes without saying that humanity is faced with a
handful of scientific challenges, which, if met, would position the
inventor as heroic. The list of ``most important people'' would
surely include anybody who cured AIDS, invented teleportation or
discovered an organism that ate air and sea pollution and excreted
pure oxygen.
 &HT;    As to important products, these are in the eye of the beholder.
Some people might consider a toaster that won't burn bread to be
vital. On a world level, we probably all agree that non-polluting
cars; low-cost, low-earth-orbiting satellites; and perfectly safe
airplanes would be major new products.
 &HT;    My more idiosyncratic list would include batteries (1/100th the
size and 100 times the capacity), ubiquitous wireless
communications and computers with common sense.
 &HT;    We underestimate the need for products to improve power
management. Just look at the spaghetti of cords and AC adapters you
have, witness the enormous proportion of weight and size of
batteries in cellphones and electric cars, and consider the
potential impact of wireless power distribution (if we could invent
it). We are doing better and better at consuming less power in the
digital world, but the physical world is far less flexible.
 &HT;    The field of wireless communication today is compartmentalized,
inconsistent and unreliable. Think of a scale that goes from the
handy remote-control unit of your television (i.e., near-field
wireless communications) to global satellite systems. The challenge
is to make our wireless world seamless. In so doing, we will have
to have far more compatible systems that can talk to each other
regardless of where we are in the world or how far away on the
scale.
 &HT;    Digital common sense is the highest on my list. If computers in
2010 could have the common sense of an 8-year-old child, the world
would be a better place. The human interface with computers is in
part driven by the quality of the computer's sensory means, those
for both expression and recognition.
 &HT;    But in much greater part, the quality of the interface is driven
by the computer's intelligence. No more dumb error messages, no
more standstill because of typos, no more mistakes because the
computer ``did what I said vs. what I meant.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Not long ago, malls devastated downtown shopping areas;; is
it possible the expected surge in e-commerce might make malls
obsolete?
 &HT;    ___ Eduardo Salazar, Madrid
 &HT;    
 &HT;    A: Without question. Malls as we know them will become obsolete
as a means to sell the products that people know they want. Malls
will become the means to browse, the places to meet people and the
centers for location-based entertainment. Mall owners and tenants
need to reinvent their own magnetism, which in the future will be

 By LYNN HIRSCHBERG  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    It's around 2 o'clock on Halloween morning, four hours outside
of Cleveland on Interstate 80, and Sean Penn, who is behind the
wheel of a rented Olds 88, is saying what he has been saying for
days, weeks, years.
 &HT;    ``This is it,'' he says. ``I'm not going to act in movies
again.''
 &HT;    In Hollywood, which is the place where he has said this the
most, it is understood less as an announcement of a retirement he
never quite sticks to than as a frequently repeated existential
declaration of his unhappiness with the movie business and the
films it makes now.
 &HT;    Jack Nicholson, a close friend of Penn's, says: ``He won't quit.
But let him whirl around, saying he's quitting. Sean is brilliant,
but, of course, we know that's no solace for anybody.''
 &HT;    Warren Beatty, another close friend, says: ``He's not going to
give up acting. What Sean means is that he would like to give up
the thought of making the brand of picture that opens big on a
Friday night.''
 &HT;    Many in Hollywood also understand that Penn _ who, for all his
world-weariness, is only 38 _ may be the best actor of his
generation, and also the most influential, a role model for the
likes of Matt Damon and Edward Norton. And for all his talk of
quitting he has been very busy this year, with roles in two new
movies _ ``Hurlyburly,'' a dark drama about the male psyche, based
on a play by David Rabe, and ``The Thin Red Line,'' the
much-heralded return of the director Terrence Malick, whose last
movie was ''Days of Heaven,'' in 1978.
 &HT;    Penn is also starring in a Woody Allen movie now being completed
in and around New York, a period piece in which Penn plays a jazz
guitarist. Penn, who has never played the guitar, learned the
fingering for 30 songs in two months.
 &HT;    ``I have these nightmares,'' he says, lighting an American
Spirit cigarette somewhere in Pennsylvania in the middle of the
night. ``I'm trying to play a solo and my fingers can't find the
strings.''
 &HT;    Penn drags on the cigarette, opening the window slightly so he
can blow out the smoke. When Penn is bothered, his features seem to
narrow _ his bright blue eyes become small pinpoints; his mouth
sets in a clench. It's an expression he has often worn in his
movies.
 &HT;    From the guilty murderer on death row in ``Dead Man Walking'' to
the corrupted son who betrays his vicious father in ``At Close
Range,'' from the misfit, would-be spy in ``The Falcon and the
Snowman'' to the lovesick, half-crazy husband in ``She's So
Lovely,'' Penn has made a career of playing complicated and, more
important, unredeemed characters.
 &HT;    He is, in all ways, the opposite of the Toms. Where Cruise and
Hanks take only parts in which they are likable or heroic or both,
Penn is attracted to darkness _ men who are caught up in the sort
of struggles that will never be resolved neatly or with a
million-dollar smile. He likes to play messy guys, even if today's
audience prefers a simpler approach, a happy ending.
 &HT;    ``Tom Cruise and Tom Hanks are a symptom, a sign of a
demographic study,'' says one famed Hollywood actor, who would love
to work with either. ``They are giving the public what they want.
And that's not bad. But Sean is a genius. He gets it in a different
way. And I don't think it's important that they get him.''
 &HT;    ``The climate is always changing,'' says Nicholson, who is
probably the only big box-office actor who can play an unrepentant
jerk, as he did in ``As Good as It Gets,'' and still be considered
lovable. ``And, sure, there are always going to be limitations on
the popularity of any theatrical event. But it comes in all shapes,
and Sean knows that. My own sense is that these big melodramas,
these action films, would have peaked with the conservative
movement, but I was wrong about that.
 &HT;    ``Sean gets discouraged, but all this will change. Just as
fashion moves, the movies will move. And any worthwhile actor isn't
thinking about melodramas anyway. They want to have a body of
work.''
 -0- 
 &HT;    ```He's one part cowboy,'' says Madonna, whom Penn always refers
to not by name but as ``my first wife.'' ``Sean is a cowboy poet.''
 &HT;    He is also a throwback to the sort of men _ tough, thoughtful,
somewhat dangerous, full of inchoate feeling _ who haunt the songs
of Bruce Springsteen and the writings of Charles Bukowski.
 &HT;    Penn is romantic about America and the kind of questing spirit
that finds solace driving fast on an open highway or crashing in a
small-town motel room or drinking late in an all-night bar. He also
seems to go out of his way to cultivate this image, perhaps to
build for himself a place he'd rather be than late-'90s Hollywood.
He is dismayed by the marketplace, by directors he has worked with
and by talented actors who, Penn says, have sold their talent on
the cheap by appearing in sure-fire megablockbusters for the
payday.
 &HT;    People say that Penn could be making $6 million, $8 million a
picture _ not the money the Toms make, but big money _ if he had
constructed his career with that in mind. Instead, people in the
industry believe, he worked for scale _ probably $150,000 _ in
making ``Hurlyburly'' and was probably paid around $300,000 for
``Thin Red Line.''
 &HT;    ``Nic Cage is no longer an actor,'' he says. ``He could be
again, but now he's more like a ... performer.'' Penn lights
another cigarette. ``Don't get me wrong, I would like to get paid,
but I don't know what you do with anything over $10 million. After
that, it doesn't make any sense to me.
 &HT;    ``And at a certain point,'' he continues, ``it's just, do you
want to be around the people? There's times when it's just
excruciating.''
 &HT;    Mostly Penn doesn't sense a lot of passion, not in mainstream
Hollywood now.
 &HT;    ``It's a bad time for acting,'' he says. ``Movies break down
into the expressive and the impressive. And the impressive has
pretty well taken over the box office. The thing film actors of my
generation are most afraid of is being found out to be a fraud.
Even the ones that aren't frauds think they are.
 &HT;    ``That's why so many people succumb to a mass embrace. It makes
them feel protected against the anxiety that they may not have
anything to share. Some of them do have something to share, but
they've given it up.''
 -0- 
 &HT;    Penn did most of his growing up in Malibu. His mother, Eileen
Ryan, is an actress (she played his grandmother in ``At Close
Range''), and his father, Leo Penn, who died in autumn, was a film
and television director. Penn went to Santa Monica High School,
where he met, surfed and hung out with Emilio Estevez and Charlie
Sheen. He began directing Super 8 movies in high school, never
intending to act.
 &HT;    ``I couldn't get enough people to fill out the casts,'' Penn
explained to me one afternoon more than four years ago. ``And then
I really started getting into acting _ I would call it an
obsession. I started to see the craft of it and I wanted to get a
handle on that craft.''
 &HT;    But he was disillusioned by the movie business, he said. He was
emotional; it wasn't a cool sort of unhappiness.
 &HT;    ``When I started out, I thought anything was possible, but now I
realize the studios don't know anything. These are not literary
minds. They don't recognize anything that's not on their computer.
Every single person who works for the studios is stupid. I've never
heard an intelligent comment on a script or a movie. Not one. It
makes you angry.''
 &HT;    But now, driving on the Interstate, I ask: ``What was the most
extreme time of your life?''
 &HT;    Penn smiles. ``I fear answering that question on the grounds
that I might become romantic about villainy.'' He's a little
distracted _ he's actually looking to see if there are signs about
passing lanes.
 &HT;    ``Look,'' he continues, ``I had a couple of stages of tempting
fate, as it was. I was lonely. It's that thing _ you're never
lonelier than when you are in a crowd and you're never in a crowd
more often than when you're lonely. And that's the epitome of
self-destruction.''
 &HT;    In 1987 Penn served 34 days in jail for punching an extra on the
set of ``Colors'' who was trying to take his picture. The incident
was not unusual: Penn spent most of his marriage to Madonna
aggressively shielding her from the paparazzi. Since Lady Diana's
death, Penn believes, his assault has been vindicated. The Screen
Actors Guild invited him to appear on a panel about privacy and the
press.
 &HT;    ``I'm not out there like some kind of madman, but just have
somebody follow you around all the time,'' he says. ``When somebody
with a prettier face than mine gets killed in a tunnel then it's,
ooh, we have to do something. But, bottom line, the paparazzi's
abusive freedom of the press will be protected more enduringly than
the individual's.''
 &HT;    Most of Penn's press skirmishes occurred when he was with
Madonna. During their wedding, he took out his rifle and shot at
the helicopters.
 &HT;    ``People started to think I was a jerk,'' Penn says now. ``The
court forced me to go for therapy. It was ridiculous. I was
supposed to go there for alcoholism and a tendency toward violence.
The psychiatrist told them she couldn't treat me for those things.
I'm not an alcoholic _ I'm just a big drinker, and there's a
difference. Now my actions wouldn't be seen the same way. But,
then, I was a pariah. I was diminishing my position.''
 &HT;    During his time in jail, Penn says he read, in one two-day
stretch, the essays of Montaigne, a novel by William Burroughs,
some Raymond Carver short stories and the collected works of James
Thurber. ``I recommend Thurber for everyone in jail,'' he says.
 &HT;    When his time was finished, two friends drove up with a pizza to
pick him up. ``I was married to my first wife,'' Penn says. ``The
pizza was the nourishment on the ride home to the wife.''
 &HT;    ``She must have been happy to see you,'' I say.
 &HT;    Penn smiles. ``Not particularly,'' he says.
 &HT;    ``Were you happy to see her?''
 &HT;    ``That night?'' Penn jokes. ``Or the next morning?'' He laughs.
``Listen, it's not a comment on her. Just a comment on the state of
the marriage at the time. Going to jail is not good for any
marriage.''
 &HT;    Penn smiles. He may be calmer now, better able to spot trouble
on the horizon and hold his temper, but there's a strain of anger
in Penn that will never be completely quieted.
 &HT;    ``Sean's this mix of angry and funny,'' Nicholson says. ``I say,
'Sean, it's easier to be happy.'''
 &HT;    But Penn is happy. He likes to maintain a certain sense of
outrage. It's his way of being someone he can like; it's his way of
staying pure. This is the character he is most comfortable with,
the role he never tires of playing.
 -0- 
 &HT;    Penn's mobile phone rings. ``Speak to me of love,'' he says into
the receiver. It's his wife, Robin Wright Penn, calling from
California to check on the drive. She and their two children are
home in Marin County, north of San Francisco.
 &HT;    Penn and his wife, whose best-known role, perhaps, was playing
Jenny in ``Forrest Gump,'' met in 1989 on the set of ``State of
Grace.'' They fell in love and then battled for years, separating
for long periods of time. During one of those separations, I
happened to be at a party in New York, and Penn took over the room.
 &HT;    When the phone would ring, he'd answer and chat for 10, 15
minutes with the caller. He'd pretend to be a character, and he was
very funny. At one point he left the party, returning with an Irish
singer. The man was a poet and serenaded the room while Penn leaned
back in his chair, content. Penn left with the most beautiful girl
at the party.
 &HT;    ``Oh, yeah,'' he says, when I reminded him of the evening.
``That was then.''
 &HT;    He was always close to his kids and reunited with Robin in 1995.
``We got married at Art Linson's,'' Penn recalls. Linson has
produced two movies Penn has starred in, ``Fast Times at Ridgemont
High'' and ``Casualties of War,'' and is a good friend. ``He was
the best man, but my brother said, 'This isn't a wedding, this is
an HBO special,' because so many drunk actors got to talk.'' The
men Penn looks up to as role models were there _ Beatty, Marlon
Brando, Nicholson _ to toast their favorite son.
 &HT;    About two years ago, Penn and his wife decided to leave Los
Angeles for Marin County. ``It was good,'' Penn says of the move.
``I had a ghost on every corner at that point. There wasn't a
building in the city of Los Angeles I hadn't gone in at night and
walked out of in the daytime, shaking.'' Penn looks pensive. He
says, ``It's nice to go back and look at a corner and smile and
say, 'I lived through that one too.'''
 &HT;    At moments like this, as Penn is speeding through the night for
no particular reason and talking on and on like this, he is his own
movie. It must be hard to subsume all this for a film director, or
for anyone. You can see why Penn would be more attracted to writing
and directing his own films. He is planning to direct his next
movie in the spring. It will star Eddie Vedder, the lead singer of
Pearl Jam, on a road trip.
 &HT;    ``Is it autobiographical?'' I ask.
 &HT;    ``Isn't everything?'' he replies.

 By JEFFREY E. GARTEN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    __  Here are three reasons for Americans to fear the arrival of
a united European currency.  __
 &HT;    
 &HT;    For more than 50 years Washington longed for a strong Europe as
a political and economic partner. With the limited introduction of
the euro, will the gods be punishing us by granting our wish?
 &HT;    The birth of the euro is the most important change in the
international financial arena since 1971, when President Nixon
announced that the dollar would no longer be exchangeable into
gold. The ``euro zone'' will have a larger population than
America's and the second largest economy in the world.
 &HT;    For the first time since pre-World War I days, when the British

 &HT;    What difference could all this make to Americans? Three
scenarios, all set approximately five years from now, when the euro
is fully established in world markets, give a glimpse of what may
lie ahead.
 -0- 
 &HT;    1. TRADE WAR
 &HT;    Suppose a series of global trade negotiations is reaching its
conclusion in 2004. Let's assume that the entire negotiation
becomes stalemated, with recriminations and threats flying across
the Atlantic. To pressure Washington, the European Central Bank _
the equivalent of our Federal Reserve _ begins to lower interest
rates, thereby weakening the euro. As a depreciating euro makes
European products cheaper, imports begin to flood American markets.
 &HT;    Washington, fearing a rapidly rising trade deficit and slower
economic growth, faces an agonizing choice: either push down the
dollar in retaliation, thereby starting a global trade war, or give
in on a few trade issues. Uncle Sam caves.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    2. DOLLAR COLLAPSE
 &HT;    Suppose American intelligence discovers that North Korea is
mobilizing troops for an invasion. Washington visibly strengthens
military ties with Tokyo to demonstrate to North Korea that both
American and Japanese soldiers are prepared to defend South Korea.
 &HT;    China is offended by the American initiative because it has
historically felt threatened by the U.S.-Japan military alliance,
and because it wants to reduce the tensions in its own backyard by
less confrontational diplomacy. Unable to pressure Washington any
other way, Beijing begins to exchange a portion of its huge
holdings of Treasury bonds for euro securities, which are seen as a
good substitute for the greenback.
 &HT;    As dollars are sold, the greenback falls sharply in value. Aside
from being livid that someone is manipulating its currency,
Washington also has to be concerned about the threat of inflation
that will arise because cheaper dollars will raise prices on
imports. President Gore or President Bush offers to meet his
Chinese counterpart to discuss less provocative ways to handle the
confrontation.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    3. LEADERSHIP CRISIS
 &HT;    Asia has recovered from economic collapse, but a new financial
debacle occurs in Latin America. Because America's trade and
banking links to the region have become so strong, Washington
quickly orders the International Monetary Fund to provide bailout
funds. But wait. A new voice is heard from Frankfurt, headquarters
of the European Central Bank.
 &HT;    ``Not so fast,'' it says. ``Latin America is your problem, not
ours.'' The European Fed uses its voting power, which now
aggregates at least 11 European nations, to veto Washington's
plans. It is the first veto of such American action, and the
president is forced to plead with Congress for taxpayer funds to
rescue our friends to the south.
 &HT;    These aren't paranoid stories from the twilight zone. In the
past, Washington hasn't hesitated to use dollar diplomacy to press
Japan to open its markets, to force England and France to change
their foreign policies and to muscle the IMF to intervene abroad in
economic crises.
 &HT;    Now that there will be two powerful global currencies, why
shouldn't the new big guy on the block exercise his clout from time
to time?
 &HT;    The euro won't necessarily lead to confrontation between Europe
and America. But if it succeeds, it will mark the passing of the
old order for Europe, for Washington's dominance of trans-Atlantic
relationships and for the conduct of international finance.
 &HT;    America had it easy when it was king of the hill, printing money
to finance its chronic trade deficits and service its growing
foreign debts. And in times of great crisis or uncertainty, the
world parked its money in Treasury securities, contributing to a
stronger dollar and lower interest rates. Now that there will be
two economic giants, investors will have a choice, and America will
have to play by someone else's rules.
 &HT;    The big question is whether Washington and Europe will cooperate
closely to manage global monetary affairs, or whether they will try
to practice traditional hardball financial diplomacy. For the sake
of economic growth everywhere, let's hope they take the friendly
path.
 &HT;    Otherwise, the global economy is in for turmoil that will vastly
overshadow anything that has happened in Asia recently. When the
relationship between the dollar and the euro goes haywire,
countries accounting for nearly half of world trade and production
will be affected, and the ripples will ensure that all global trade
and investment will become unsettled.
 &HT;    Money is increasingly the currency of power these days, and the
old patterns and relationships are about to change. How Washington
and Wall Street handle this new challenge will say a lot about how
the new century begins _ in America and around the world.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;     ___Sorry, but the Internet isn't about ``community.'' It's
about competition, pal. ___ 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    In a mild case of man bites dog, Carl Shapiro and Hal Varian's
``Information Rules: A Strategic Guide to the Network Economy'' is
apparently outselling Kevin Kelly's ``New Rules for the New
Economy: 10 Radical Strategies for a Connected World.''
 &HT;    Both books purport to be manuals for business in the Internet
age.
 &HT;    However, not only is Kelly the executive editor of Wired
magazine, but he also writes in the best Tom Peters style, a
rapid-fire blur of neologisms and breathless declarations. He
writes that all the rules have changed, that there are limitless
opportunities for those who have the courage to let go of old
assumptions.
 &HT;    Why, then, is he being outsold by a couple of economics
professors who rather primly declare that ``we seek models, not
trends; concepts, not vocabulary; and analysis, not analogies''?
 &HT;    Of course, the chemistry of publishing success is mysterious.
But this particular sales competition may mark a turning point in
the way business _ and the public at large _ perceives the Internet
and, for that matter, the whole ``new economy.''
 &HT;    For while Kelly, true to his Wired roots, offers us a sort of
New Age meets Horatio Alger vision _ in this brave new world, he
tells us, entrepreneurs will do well by doing good _ Shapiro and
Varian are hardheaded, even Machiavellian. To make money from
information, they suggest, you have to find clever, in some cases
dastardly, ways to outmaneuver your competition and exploit your
customers.
 &HT;    Consider my own sad story. As a thoroughly modern professor, I
post many of my writings on a personal Web site. It might seem only
reasonable to ask people to pay for the privilege of downloading my
wisdom. But on the other hand, once a piece is written it costs me
nothing to have another person access the site; if I were to charge
for access, some potential visitors would be deterred, hurting both
them and me.
 &HT;    What's more, my readership is at least partly sustained by word
of mouth; the fewer readers I have, the fewer potential new readers
will be led to check out my site. So how can I make any money off
this thing?
 &HT;    If I knew the answer to that question, of course, I would add
``.com'' to my name, launch an initial public offering and become
an instant millionaire. But my dilemma is essentially the same as
that facing many firms.
 &HT;    The information industries in general _ Internet ventures,
software developers, even many hardware manufacturers _ all have in
common the combination of high ``fixed costs'' (the one-time cost
of writing articles, developing software or designing a new chip),
low ``marginal costs'' (it costs nothing to let another person read
your article or use your program, and not much to produce another
copy of your chip) and ``network externalities'' (the more people
use your idea/program/chip, the more widespread it becomes, and
therefore the more people will find it worth buying).
 &HT;    How are they supposed to make money?
 &HT;    Kelly's answer is, essentially, not to worry about it. His ``new
rules'' for modern business include mottoes such as ``follow the
free'' (give stuff away, because it will help you sell other stuff)
and ``feed the Web first'' (shift from ``maximizing the firm's
value to maximizing the Web's value''). In other words, cast your
bread upon the cyberwaters, and it will be returned to you a
thousandfold.
 &HT;    Shapiro and Varian insist that ``information rules'' are simply
exaggerated versions of the rules that have always applied to
high-fixed-cost, low-marginal-cost industries such as, say,
airlines.
 &HT;    Now, airlines, in case you haven't noticed, don't follow the
free. They find clever ways of charging what the traffic will bear.
Buy your ticket well in advance and stay over Saturday night, and
it will be pretty cheap _ not because serving you costs the airline
less, but because the restrictions screen out business travelers,
who can then be held up for a ransom.
 &HT;    Similar strategies can be applied to the information sector.
Shapiro and Varian approvingly note the example of IBM's
inexpensive home-office-oriented Laser Printer Series E. (Remember,
this is a guide to business strategy, not ethics.) It was slower
than the premium-price Series F, they note, not because it was of
inferior quality but because it contained a special chip to slow it
down.
 &HT;    They also mention the Windows NT Workstation, which is
apparently identical to the much more expensive NT server except
for a few minor code changes designed to reduce its capabilities.
In short, according to Shapiro and Varian, the new economy is a
place where it often pays to play ugly.
 &HT;    All of which brings us, of course, to politics. Not too long
ago, the dominant ideology of the cyberelite _ led, in particular,
by Louis Rosetto, one of Wired's founders _ was strongly
libertarian; all the digerati wanted from government was to be left
alone. I don't know whether Kelly shares that view, but his book
does seem to describe a world in which government intervention is
unnecessary, maybe even irrelevant.
 &HT;    By contrast, the new economy described by Varian and Shapiro
(who was the Justice Department's chief antitrust economist in 1995
and 1996) sounds like a prime candidate for government
intervention, rife with probable market failures and with
opportunities for firms to play ugly in ways detrimental not just
to their competitors but to consumers too.
 &HT;    ``Don't expect the government's role to diminish,'' they warn;
and their book concludes not only with some prescriptions about
what the government should do but also with some advice about how
companies can avoid getting into antitrust trouble. Too bad Bill
Gates didn't get an early draft.
 &HT;    Maybe I'm reading too much into book sales, but it seems to me
that the success of Shapiro and Varian is, like the Microsoft case,
an indicator that the Information Age has lost its innocence.
Information technology is no longer something idealists do for fun.
Not only has it become big business, it has also become a business
whose underlying rules practically invite antisocial practices such
as price discrimination and predation.
 &HT;    In short, say goodbye to the geeks in their garages, and say
hello to the new railroad barons _ and by the way, see you in
court.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Far into the 21st century, presidential scholars
will be dissecting the achievements, failures and credibility of a
perplexing paradox known as William Jefferson Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   And they probably will be as divided in their opinion of the
42nd president as we Americans are today.
</P>
<P>
   When he journeyed to Capitol Hill last week to explain his
perception of the state of the union, Clinton gave one of the most
memorable and tantalizing performances in the history of an exalted
office that stretches back 210 years to George Washington's first
inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   Although he could be expelled from that office as a perjurer and
obstructor of justice, he appeared as filled with confidence and
foresight as Theodore Roosevelt attacking the trusts, Franklin D.
Roosevelt battling the ``economic royalists'' or Ronald Reagan
shouting from Berlin's Brandenburg Gate, ``Mr. Gorbachev, tear down
this wall.''
</P>
<P>
   An observer who knew nothing of the current troubles that
envelop Clinton could never have surmised as he addressed members
of the Congress, the Cabinet and the Supreme Court and a television
audience of more than 60 million people that the sands of his
presidency were shifting perilously beneath him.
</P>
<P>
   Such an observer never would have guessed that most of the
proposals on Clinton's lengthy legislative agenda will eventually
be filed under the heading ``rejected by Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   It may have been a hypocritical performance by a master
politician. But it also was a remarkable one that demonstrated why
Clinton continues to be the ``comeback kid.'' He is a living
paradox who confounds both his friends and his foes.
</P>
<P>
   As television cameras focused again and again on House Majority
Leader Dick Armey, Majority Whip Tom DeLay, and other Republicans
sitting in sullen silence while one burst of applause after another
greeted Clinton's calls to action, it seemed natural to recall an
incident that occurred during the stormy presidency of Franklin
Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   It was the war year of 1943 and the president had just returned
from a meeting in Casablanca with Britain's Winston Churchill and
France's feuding generals, Charles de Gaulle and Henri Giraud. On
that journey FDR became be the first incumbent president to fly in
an airplane, the first to leave America in wartime and the first
since Abraham Lincoln to visit an active theater of war.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of theater Roosevelt loved, and he was at the
top of his form, which was duly noted by his old political critic,
William Allen White, an influential voice in the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   White, publisher and editor of the Emporia (Kan.) Gazette,
explained to his readers that ``it is now 60 hours since the Old
Smiler returned to the White House from his great adventure. Biting
nails _ good, hard, bitter Republican nails _ we are compelled to
admit that Franklin Roosevelt is the most unaccountable and on the
whole the most enemy-baffling president the United States has ever
had ... Well, damn your smiling old picture, here it is ... We, who
hate your gaudy guts, salute you.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is no Roosevelt and has not done anything that deserves
the ``salute'' of his opponents. But like Roosevelt, he is not
constrained in his actions or plans by his critics or by
self-doubt.
</P>
<P>
   With dramatic flare, he grabs an initiative and runs with it,
sometimes stumbling, sometimes winning the contest. That was FDR's
mode of conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's personal behavior has been abominable and, despite the
protestations of his lawyers, it is difficult to conclude that it
has not been impeachable.
</P>
<P>
   But the agenda he laid out last week was that of a man who
expects to be an important force in American life through the
remainder of his presidential term and well into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   To him, the current battle is about politics and policy, not
about constitutional injunctions. In his speeches, his travels, his
White House meetings, he appears always to be saying that all will
be well if he can retain the support of the American people.
</P>
<P>
   That was the purpose of the potpourri of plans he unveiled last
week. The bulk of the budget surplus would be channeled into
efforts to protect Social Security and Medicare so that when people
of his own generation _ post-World War II baby boomers _ begin to
retire, they will find a nest egg awaiting them.
</P>
<P>
   He also would increase national defense spending and provide aid
for child care and long-term health care. And he said he had
instructed the Justice Department to sue the tobacco companies so
that they eventually will have to provide financial help to victims
of tobacco-induced illness.
</P>
<P>
   His suggestion that some Social Security funds be invested in
the stock market ran headlong into an unmovable object: Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. And Republicans swiftly identified
a glaring hole in Clinton's agenda: no proposal for a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   That means that if he remains in office until 2001, when his
term expires, he and the GOP-dominated Congress will have had
lengthy battles over how to prioritize spending of the money
derived from the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders, like millions of other Americans, are
disgusted with Clinton's personal conduct, but despite their
disdain, they as professional politicians were clearly awed last
week by the gaudiness of his gutsy performance.

<P>
   From the beginning, Nick Broomfield said, there was stiff
resistance to ``Kurt and Courtney,'' his documentary about the rock
star Kurt Cobain, who died in 1994, and his wife, the performer and
actress Courtney Love.
</P>
<P>
   A filmmaker perpetually on the trot, his shoulder-borne camera
at the ready and microphone extended, Broomfield established his
aggressively persistent yet mild-mannered investigatory style in
``Heidi Fleiss: Hollywood Madam'' and other works.
</P>
<P>
   Broomfield has always shown a fine eye for high sleaze, although
at first ``Kurt and Courtney,'' to be released on video Tuesday by
BMG, was intended to take a higher road. Cobain, leader of the
group Nirvana, disdained material success and had difficulty living
with fame.
</P>
<P>
   His death was ruled a suicide, but the film focuses on people
from his circle who insist that the circumstances were mysterious.
Some of them suggest that Ms. Love may have had something to do
with it.
</P>
<P>
   Broomfield said that he had originally planned to skirt that
issue and concentrate on Cobain as artist and troubled soul. ``His
attitude was unusual for the 90's,'' he said. ``Here is someone
with such high beliefs. How did he end up the way he did?'' But to
get at what was bothering Cobain, the film needed the use of his
songs. Ms. Love refused to grant rights. ``Which is kind of
ridiculous because you can get them in any record store,''
Broomfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Not for use on screen, however. Ms. Love, he added, also fought
to suppress the film by intimidating backers and exhibitors. ``It's
easier to do a picture about a famous politician than it is about
an entertainer who represents many millions of dollars and is
attached to corporate entities who want to protect him,''
Broomfield said. ``First you can't get access, and then when you've
finished the film you can't get distribution because the same
people are leaning on exhibitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Rights issues forced a withdrawal of the film from the Sundance
Film Festival last year. Later it was released in theaters,
received good reviews and made $600,000 at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   With other avenues, like the music, closed to him, Broomfield
took ``Kurt and Courtney'' onto lower ground: theorizing about the
singer's death. Politely but firmly cornered by the camera, a
parade of lesser Cobain friends and acquaintances from the depleted
Seattle grunge scene express opinions about his demise.
</P>
<P>
   Generally it doesn't go well for Ms. Love, who is painted as a
manipulative and violent harridan. Several of those interviewed say
that if she didn't actually have Cobain killed, she may have
encouraged any suicidal inclinations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't murdered,'' the couple's former nanny says. ``He was
driven to murder himself.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Heidi Fleiss: Hollywood Madam,'' Broomfield finally tracks
down the elusive Ms. Fleiss, who is open and likable. Although Ms.
Love is seen at several points in ``Kurt and Courtney,'' she never
submits to a Broomfield interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a world I expected to go into,'' Broomfield said.
``It just got darker and darker, which isn't the way I thought it
would go.'' &QL;

   Thinking he has bought a ticket for an E.M. Forster film, the
musty English writer Giles De'Ath (John Hurt) instead finds himself
in the American movie ``Hotpants College 2.'' But as he is about to
walk out, a teen-age vision named Ronnie Bostock (Jason Priestley)
appears on screen and captivates old Giles to the extent that he's
soon shoplifting fan magazines and asking for titles like ``Tex
Mex'' at the video store.
</P>
<P>
   Later he goes to Long Island and gets to know the boy. That
Ronnie is overmatched comes as no surprise, as is Priestley by
Hurt, whose performance, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times,
``is simply wonderful _ acerbic, funny and heartbreaking.'' &QL;

   Holed up in a ratty apartment stuffed with computer equipment,
Maximilian Cohen (Sean Gullette) concludes that, mathematics being
the language of nature, everything on the planet runs on the same
216-digit number. That alerts interests as diverse as the stock
market, which offers Max a superchip to speed his calculations, and
Orthodox Jews, who see the figure as being the key to the Messianic
age.
</P>
<P>
   Driven crazy by crippling headaches, Max weighs warnings to slow
down from an old mentor who burned out pursuing the ratio of the
circumference of a circle to its diameter. The crude camera work
can be annoying, but Darren Aronofsky's first feature film
effectively ``poses age-old questions about the relationships
between genius and insanity'' (Stephen Holden). &QL;

   It's fortunate that Jackie Chan is the Buster Keaton of martial
arts films because Chris Tucker, his partner in Brett Ratner's
comedic action film, talks many times too much for both of them.
Involuntarily assigned to assist a visiting Chinese detective named
Lee ( Chan), Carter (Tucker) and his mouth manage to get both of
them nearly killed.
</P>

   Lee expresses himself by scooting up walls. Only the plot,

   If Brian Gilbert's film didn't frankly depict Oscar Wilde's
sexual affairs, it might pass for a classroom lesson on his courage
in the face of intolerance. Looking uncannily like Wilde, Stephen
Fry plays him with gusto. Jude Law makes a voluptuous, petulant
Lord Alfred Douglas, but Wilde's trial for gross indecency doesn't
give rise to high drama. What's best about the film ``is the effort
to understand sacrifice, helplessness, as part of love'' (Maslin). &QL;

   THE McCOURTS OF LIMERICK. Conor McCourt, son of Malachy McCourt,
brings together his father and uncles for a bittersweet
reminiscence about their often horrendous upbringing. On screen
Frank McCourt is as good a storyteller as he was in his
best-selling memoir ``Angela's Ashes.'' Malachy, Alphie and Michael
McCourt put a loving edge on a portrait of a family still working

   FUNNY GAMES. It's not easy to watch, but Michael Haneke's film
presents a beautifully acted and paced thriller about a family

SEVRES NOW: GOING BEYOND ROSE TEACUPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The changing of the guard at the American Craft
Museum in New York has widened its vision considerably, judging
from ``Art and Industry: Contemporary Porcelain From Sevres,''
which opened last week and runs through May 2.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Holly Hotchner, then the museum's new director,
had a brainstorm after seeing an exhibition of early 19th-century
Sevres porcelain at the Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the
Decorative Arts: Why not organize a show on 20th-century Sevres?
</P>
<P>
   She shared her idea with David Revere McFadden, the new chief
curator at the craft museum. He responded with an emphatic yes.
</P>
<P>
   McFadden was thoroughly acquainted with the collections at the
Manufacture Nationale de Sevres outside Paris from his time as a
curator at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum. He also knew
that Sevres, which started its operations in 1738, had commissioned
works by 20th-century artists from all over the world, including
Jean Arp, Betty Woodman, Charles Simonds and Jim Dine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a democratic system,'' McFadden explained. ``The
Sevres factory only invites artists they think are doing
interesting work.'' He chose 150 pieces by about 50 artists,
architects and designers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to represent as diverse a cross-section of forms as
possible, and I wanted to show things that are still in
production,'' McFadden said. ``These pieces are all available by
order.''
</P>
<P>
   The works range from sculptures to teapots to light fixtures.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one thought of porcelain as being useful, say, for
lighting,'' McFadden said. ``Artists can change our perception of
form. Even when an artist takes an old pattern, as Alexander Calder
did, when they paint it, it becomes a work of art.''
</P>
<P>
   Calder, for example, took a classic Sevres plate form, the
``Diane,'' and painted an entire service with balloonlike
configurations in bright colors. Each plate is different so that
every time the table is set, the canvas is recomposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get the sense the artists know their work will be recombined
in different ways every time it's used, and they like this,''
McFadden said. ``It takes on a new life.''
</P>
<P>
   The artists represented a range of contemporary Americans, from
the California ceramists Adrian Saxe and Viola Frey to Ettore
Sottsass Jr., the Italian architect, and Boris Sipek, the Czech
industrial designer. Most are still alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The material is limited only by the ideas that are brought to
it by creative people,'' McFadden said. ``The show represents
everyone's take on it.''
</P>
<P>
   McFadden brought in Peter Marino, a New York architect who has
done private interiors and boutiques for Yves Saint Laurent,
Armani, Chanel and Vuitton, to design the installation, because he
knew Marino collected Sevres. Marino has lent some of his own
antiques in transforming the museum into splendid room settings of
different periods.
</P>
<P>
   The 20th-century gallery has a Modern salon with walls of blond
wood. Here Marino composed a ``painting'' of Sevres plates by
Calder, Olivier Debre and Serge Poliakoff on one wall, echoing it
on another with a large Julian Schnabel smashed plate painting.
</P>
<P>
   ``This reminds us of Sevres' famous tradition of breaking plates
that are not absolutely perfect,'' Marino said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   The most fabulous setting is upstairs, in a deep blue Empire
Dining Room with a long banquet table covered in gold cloth. There
are gold Empire antique chairs and a settee circa 1812; two
circa-1810 consoles and gold fillets on the burr thya wood antique
dessert console from 1790, which the dealer Didier Aaron has lent
to the show. The table is set with gold-embossed crystal and
elegant contemporary blue, white and gold Sevres porcelain plates.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who sees it will yearn to be a guest, the better to study
the splendid, almost 11-foot-long Sevres centerpiece created by
Anne and Patrick Poirier, French artists who are married and in
residence at the Getty Center in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by Napoleon's Egyptian Campaign of 1799, the Poiriers'
``Ruins of Egypt'' is an installation in hard-paste white
``biscuit'' (unglazed) porcelain of ancient-looking Egyptian
columns, statues of pharaohs and sphinxes, figural sculptures and
two blue-glazed porcelain ``reflecting'' pools. The forms can be
taken apart and reassembled in new configurations, for people who
want to recreate scenes from ``The English Patient'' at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ruins become the symbol of change and continuity, because of
memory,'' McFadden said. ``There is a poetical association with
ruins.''
</P>
<P>
   A neoclassical library has two mahogany tables that display
Louise Bourgeois' Sevres ``Fallen Women'' sculptures. The Viennese
Tea Room is furnished with a suite of black ebonized period
furniture attributed to Leopold Bauer, with chairs by Josef
Hoffmann.
</P>
<P>
   What is remarkable about some of these contemporary works _ for
example, a teapot designed by Adrian Saxe _ is that they were
created using the oldest techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Saxe, a Los Angeles ceramist and a professor at UCLA, was an
artist-in-residence at Sevres in 1983, when the factory was trying
to re-invent 18th-century soft-paste porcelain, named ``Old
Vincennes,'' after the name of the chateau where it was made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had free rein of the archives of old molds and models,''
Saxe said. ``I decided to mix and match my forms with Sevres
handles and bases from the earlier periods. I like developing the
syntax and grammars of the old materials, then bringing them
kicking and raging into the present.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his teapots in the show has the silhouette of a face and
is painted to look like wood. It was very difficult to make. First
of all, it took a lot of trial and error to get the color he wanted
_ a chartreuse like ``an old Deux Chevaux.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The enamels had not been adjusted for the soft paste, so they
would peel,'' he recalled. ``And the pieces slumped in the
firing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do things in an irrational translation of color,'' he said,
like having a ``wood'' teapot in chartreuse. ``I wanted it to look
naturalistic, and not naturalistic. The French tradition was to
study nature and then reinvent it in an idealized form. I wanted to
do it in a chrome-based chartreuse that is a pop color. I try to
take things without idealizing them and put them in another
context.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Austrians, who cherish porcelain painted to look like
wood grain, or faux bois, the people at Sevres were against it.
``The French would normally never allow faux bois,'' Saxe said.
``But I found a painter who could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sevres show is one of the museum's first efforts to showcase
crafts from abroad. ``It's the beginning of our move to be more
international,'' said Jack Lenor Larsen, a longtime board member.
``It's a good direction. Everyone is going global.''

MERCEDES DELIVERS IMPRESSIVE TRIO  
 (ADV: EMBARGOED FOR SATURDAY, JAN. 23) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Here is a pair of handsome, hedonistic cars from
Mercedes-Benz, plus a more down-to-earth sedan offered at a
moderate price (at least for Mercedes).
</P>
<P>
   First, the fun stuff. Mercedes CLK class, which debuted last
year with a shapely compact coupe, the CLK320, now offers a potent
V-8 version of the same coupe.
</P>
<P>
   If you're attuned to Mercedes' arcane nomenclature, then you
know the CLK320 is powered by a six-cylinder, 3.2-liter engine. For
'99, the CLK430 boasts a V-8.
</P>
<P>
   The V-8 is a 4.3-liter, natch, that puts out enough rumbling
torque to turn the sophisticated coupe into a real muscle car. It's
a small, expensive muscle car, fully $8,000 more than the 320, but
it delivers the goods.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the hot V-8 is a package of suspension, steering and
braking components from performance-tweaker AMG that add a whole
new level of responsiveness and handling to the coupe.
</P>
<P>
   Power, finesse, luxury, technology _ the CLK430 has it all. All
except one thing, and that's covered by the other new addition, the
CLK320 Cabriolet. It has a top that folds back to let the sunshine
in.
</P>
<P>
   This is Mercedes' first four-place convertible since the demise
of the bigger E320 Cabriolet. The new ones may be smaller, but
they're significantly less expensive, more sporty and more
distinctive. As with the old E-series Cabriolet, there should be
plenty of affluent buyers lining up for them. And they should
become instant collectibles.
</P>
<P>
   The nicely tailored fabric top folds back into a compartment
behind the seats with the touch of a button, closing the hatch over
the stowed top and allowing you to remain in the seat while the car
does all the work.
</P>
<P>
   The Cabriolet displays almost none of the extra shake and shimmy
endemic to topless cars, just a bit of extra dashboard-area
vibration. Otherwise, handling and response are as solid and
seamless as the coupe's.
</P>
<P>
   The CLK trio shares the handsome, swept-back front end that
mimics, in a smaller way, the E-class look. The front-end styling
is a great look, carrying over Mercedes' traditional, prominent
grille, but flanked by two gleaming sets of ovoid cat's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   This treatment helps to visually separate the CLK cars from the
more conservative C-class compact sedans. Though similar in size
and mechanical parts, the sedans retain the flat, rectangular
headlights.
</P>
<P>
   A new model in the C-class, the C230 Kompressor is designed to
fill the low-$30,000 range as an entry-level luxury car. It uses
the existing supercharged four-cylinder engine from the SLK230
sports car to reduce the cost, while still supplying a fair level
of performance and plenty of solid Mercedes value.
</P>
<P>
   It's the cheapest way to step into a Mercedes and competes
against such high-level sedans as the Lexus LS300, Volvo S70 and
Buick Park Avenue. It may be hard to consider a $30,000 car a
bargain, but that's a good deal for Mercedes quality.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the engine, the C230 is essentially the C280 twin,
which is powered by a (you guessed it) 2.8-liter V-6. The
performance with the V-6 is slightly sharper, but the price tag is
$4,400 steeper. On our test car, the superb stereo system and
leather interior added about $2,600 to the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   In the smaller, lighter sports car, the supercharged four
provides plenty of pull. But in the heftier sedan, things are a bit
more placid. The horsepower and torque delivery is certainly
adequate, just not that exciting.
</P>
<P>
   Not so with the CLK430, which roars aggressively away from a
standstill, building power as the engine revs climb. At midrange,
the engine response is strong and immediate, and the handling is
right on the money (so to speak).
</P>
<P>
   Standard on the CLK430 and optional on the other two cars is the
Electronic Stability Program, or ESP, which uses a complex system
of automatic braking and throttle control to help keep overly
enthusiastic drivers out of trouble on corners and slick surfaces.
It works well, though it can be intrusive.
</P>
<P>
   The same with the automatic transmission on the CLKs, which is
touted for its ability to assess the style of the driver and shift
accordingly. Because driving in traffic or on back roads requires a
constantly changing style of driving, I found the shifting to be
unpredictable. I'd prefer it to just stay put or else have a manual
control to switch between economy and sport shifting.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes calls the CLK430 its Supercoupe, although engine power
is not quite up to that of the special-edition C43 sedan. The same
V-8 in that car is rated at 302 horsepower at a slightly higher
engine speed, 27 ponies more than the CLK430.
</P>
<P>
   For those who crave the extra performance and have the
greenbacks, the $8,000 premium on the CLK430 over the CLK320 may
seem reasonable. But last year's lengthy road test of the V-6 model
found it to be strong and capable, so unless you are set on the hot
number and money is no object, you might check out the 320.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to Mercedes' claim of a roomy, usable back seat in its
CLK cars, be forewarned that it's just for wee folk. Adult-size
humans will feel cramped. The C-series sedans are roomier but lack
the high style of the coupes and convertible.
</P>
<P>
   These Mercedes compacts have been hot sellers for the German
giant, now doing post-merger business as DaimlerChrysler. In 1998,
Mercedes set several sales records, and these new models should

<P>
   Last week, one of the House impeachment managers referred to the
removal of former federal judge Alcee L. Hastings _ in order to
buttress the notion that perjury is serious enough to warrant
impeachment. In 1989, Hastings was impeached for bribery and
numerous counts of perjury in regard to his testimony as a
defendant in a criminal case. The House manager neglected to
mention that Alcee Hastings is now a colleague, a member of the
House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, being a scoundrel while serving as a judge is
unacceptable, but isn't a barrier to joining the ranks of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Probably that isn't news to most people.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment clauses in the U.S. Constitution grant the
Senate the power to remove the president, vice president, federal
judges, and all civil officers of the United States. The Senate is
also given the authority to disqualify those convicted of articles
of impeachment from holding elected or appointed public office. The
Senate rarely votes in favor of disqualification although it only
takes a simple majority, not a two-thirds majority, to add this
restriction.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to President Clinton's impeachment, the U.S. House had
impeached 15 individuals: a president, a senator, a Cabinet member,
and 12 judges.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate convicted seven _ all judges. Only two of those seven
were disqualified from holding office in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after his impeachment, Hastings ran as a Democrat
for a House seat from his home state, Florida. He's been a member
of Congress ever since. And last September, Hastings introduced a
resolution to impeach Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr for ``high
crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastings accuses Starr of violating his oath of office, misusing
the powers granted to an independent counsel, and unlawfully
disclosing grand jury material for the purpose of embarrassing
Clinton. The House voted to table Hastings' resolution.
</P>
<P>
   An added note: Prior to his impeachment, a jury in a criminal
trial had acquitted Hastings of conspiring to solicit a bribe.
Nevertheless, the House voted in favor of 17 articles of
impeachment against Hastings, including the bribe for which a jury
had found him not guilty. The Senate convicted him of seven
articles.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Flynt sticks in GOP's craw
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 15, Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson
called for a criminal investigation of Larry Flynt. The RNC's Web
site (www.rnc.org) was filled with invective against Flynt for
nearly a week, reviling him as a smut peddler and Clinton's
pornographer.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson claims Flynt is ``obstructing a congressional
investigation'' for digging into the sexual escapades of Republican
hard-noses who want Clinton impeached. Apparently, the RNC's
chairman doesn't see the delicious irony of his statements.
</P>
<P>
   Starr couldn't find a shred of evidence against Clinton in the
Whitewater probe and found nothing to show Clinton might have been
involved with illegal use of FBI files, but the Paula Jones lawsuit
promised some sexual hanky-panky that a zealous prosecutor might be
able to finesse into an article of impeachment _ if he played his
cards right. After all, Starr had a $40 million deck.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, it's OK for Starr to dig into Clinton's sex-capades,
but it isn't OK for a private citizen to dig into the dalliances of
those Republicans who have been aiming to bring the president down
since he was re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson calls Flynt's outing of hypocrites ``the politics of
personal destruction.'' And it is. But who started it? Suddenly,
this tactic has become very personal. It could be a married
Republican senator who has his private life smeared across the
tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back to the darker era of the FBI, one cannot find the
Republican Party calling for the dismissal of director J. Edgar
Hoover for secretly recording and publicizing the sexual revelry of
certain civil rights leaders. The politics of personal destruction
was used with a vengeance against black leaders. But now, used
against the conservative establishment, it is finally considered
dangerous and wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The Nixon impeachment standard
</P>
<P>
   On July 27, 1974, when the House Judiciary Committee voted on
articles of impeachment against President Nixon, the committee
passed three: obstruction of justice, abuse of power and contempt
of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The committee rejected two articles, one of which should be at
issue in the Clinton impeachment trial. Article 4 accused Nixon of
tax evasion and illegally using government funds to improve his
private residences.
</P>
<P>
   The article reads, in part: 1) ``He ... unlawfully received
compensation in the form of government expenditures at and on his
privately-owned properties ....'' and 2) ``He knowingly and
fraudulently failed to report certain income and claimed deductions
... which were not authorized by law ....''
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee voted 26-12 against Article 4.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans alike agreed that Congress should only
impeach a president for actions taken against the Constitution or
against our form of government. Although Nixon might have been
guilty of tax evasion (a felony) and misappropriating government
funds for his own use (another felony), the committee felt that
these crimes were personal and not crimes against the nation;
therefore, not impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   If the Senate of the 106th Congress used the standard applied to
Nixon, all fair-minded Republicans would have to vote to acquit
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The actions that brought impeachment articles against Clinton
were certainly personal, even private, and do not jeopardize our
nation.
</P>
<P>
   That raises questions: Do we have two or more standards of
impeachment for presidents? If so, can this process ever be fair?

SURVEY SHOWS FRUSTRATION OVER HOUSING IN SAN FRANCISCO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The lack of affordable housing bumped
homelessness as the most serious problem facing San Francisco,
according to the second annual ``City Beat'' poll of registered
voters.
</P>
<P>
   In the survey, released Thursday by the San Francisco Chamber of
Commerce, 19 percent of the 550 randomly selected respondents said
the lack of affordable housing and high rents were the top
concerns. Seventeen percent cited homelessness as San Francisco's
most pressing problem, while 15 percent believed it was the public
transportation system.
</P>
<P>
   Mara Raider of the Coalition on Homelessness said the results
did not signal improvement in the plight of homeless people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see homelessness and lack of affordable housing as tied
together,'' said Raider, civil-rights project coordinator for the
private, nonprofit advocacy group for the homeless. ``People aren't
homeless because of no reason. Lack of affordable housing is
certainly the main issue as to why people are homeless.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey, conducted in October by GSL Research and Terris &AMP;
Jaye, gauges the voting population's sentiment on business concerns
in the city. In general, the results mirrored many of last year's
responses, which found that respondents ranked a strong business
community as the single most important contributor to quality of
life here.
</P>
<P>
   According to this year's poll, 37 percent of respondents named a
``strong economy'' as the most important factor contributing to
quality of life. None of the other concerns _ safe streets, good
schools, reliable public transportation, or a clean environment _
got more than 15 percent of respondents.
</P>
<P>
   Also in line with last year's results, about half the voters
polled expressed what the survey-takers characterized as
``pro-business'' attitudes, while 30 percent to 40 percent had
``anti-business'' sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   A full 62 percent agreed with the statement: ``City policies
that help strengthen local business result in a better quality of
life for everyone in San Francisco.'' Only 24 percent said such
policies generally hurt ``the rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What it (the survey) really does is underscore the fact voters
do support a strong business climate,'' said Carol Piasente,
spokeswoman for the chamber. ``For a long time, San Francisco had
an image of not being very friendly to business. City voters really
do make the link that a strong, healthy business climate is good
for the city's quality of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Piasente said the chamber was not surprised that housing issues
as well as the Municipal Railway, or Muni, system, which has
received much publicity about its troubles, ranked high on the
problem list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rents are so high, and it's so hard to find housing right
now,'' Piasente said. ``Vacancy rates are less than 1 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, only 7 percent of those surveyed said Muni-public
transportation was the worst problem. Also in last year's results,
28 percent said homelessness was the most serious problem, while 14
percent said housing and 12 percent crime.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Grubb, executive director of the Residential Rent
Stabilization and Arbitration Board, also was not surprised about
the shift. He said business for the board, which oversees the
city's rent laws, had increased 75 percent over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just been a tsunami that has hit us,'' Grubb said,
blaming the crunch on supply and demand. ``If the economy stays the
way it is and growth continues, I dare say it will remain to be a
top issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Grubb, however, praised Mayor Willie Brown for being receptive
to the problem, singling out his support of the $100 million
affordable-housing bond passed by voters in 1996. ``He's probably
done as much as has been done in years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Hauge, chief executive officer of the Small Business
Network, said the survey results would have been different had
small business owners been polled. He said parking and traffic,
crime and red tape would have been identified as among the top
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Hauge said the Brown administration had been sensitive to small
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we get frustrated with the bureaucracy ... when you get
down to the bottom line, San Francisco is still a good place to do
business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment was reflected by 68 percent of respondents, who
said San Francisco was better than most places to live.

SHORT NEWS ITEMS ON THE ART WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A major show of Italian Renaissance art that is on
its way to the Metropolitan Museum of Art began as an effort to
raise public awareness of the damage earthquakes did to precious
frescoes in the Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi two years ago in
central Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Three organizations _ the Ministry of Culture in Rome, the
Apostolic Library at the Vatican and the Basilica and Convent of
St. Francis at Assisi _ organized an exhibition of 70 works of art
and objects. It is at the Petit Palace in Paris until mid-February.
</P>
<P>
   This core exhibition will be supplemented by 30 more works from
museums and private collections in Europe and the United States to
create ``The Treasury of St. Francis of Assisi,'' which will be at
the Metropolitan from March 16 through June 27.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition will include medieval and Renaissance panel
painting, sculpture, goldsmiths' work, textiles and illuminated
manuscripts. It will show the development of early Renaissance art.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the reconstruction of the basilica, there was an
opportunity to remove many objects and give them greater
visibility,'' said Philippe de Montebello, the director of the Met.
``Assisi was one of the greatest centers of art in the 13th
century.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurence B. Kanter, the Met curator in charge of the exhibition,
said he had selected ``both the most telling masterpieces and works
of art in the best condition that could travel safely from
Assisi.''
</P>
<P>
   The show has three parts. The first covers the Basilica of St.
Francis, beginning with its founding in 1228 as a center of piety.
The second explores the large artists' workshops that existed
around the Convent of Assisi during its construction and decoration
from 1230 to 1330. The last features objects, mostly panel
paintings that were given to the Basilica in 1955 by the American
art historian and dealer Frederick Mason Perkins.
</P>

<P>
   The M.H. de Young Memorial Museum, which was unable to get the
money it needed for earthquake repairs from the city of San
Francisco, has raised nearly $65 million from private supporters.
This will be used to build a new museum at its Golden Gate Park
site.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989 the museum was badly damaged by the Loma Prieta
earthquake and has been swathed in structural supports ever since.
San Francisco voters twice defeated bond issues of up to $90
million, and at one point residents opposed a plan to renovate the
museum because of worries about increased traffic and damage to the
park.
</P>
<P>
   So trustees began exploring new sites for the museum, including
three outside the park. ``But each time, they came back to the
park,'' said Pamela Forbes, a spokeswoman for the museum. ``It is
our historical location, and there will be a privately financed
underground parking facility.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry S. Parker III, the museum's director, said the de Young
had ``definitely turned a corner.'' The museum's trustees have
hired Herzog &AMP; de Meuron, an architectural firm in Basel, to
develop plans for the new building, and they are to be submitted to
the board in June.
</P>
<P>
   The existing building, which dates from around 1920, is to be
torn down in stages and replaced by a new 270,000-square-foot
museum. This will be Herzog &AMP; de Meuron's largest project in the
United States. It was recently commissioned to design the new Jack
S. Blanton Museum of Art at the University of Texas in Austin, and
it has received much attention for its design of the new $208
million Tate Gallery of Modern Art, which is being built in London.
</P>
<P>
   The de Young must raise all the money privately. ``Our estimated
budget is $130 million, so we're half way there,'' Parker said.
``We may have to build in phases or build something smaller.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum hopes to begin construction in 2002 and complete the
building by 2006. Until the new museum is built and deemed
seismically sound, so it qualifies for federal insurance
indemnification, the de Young is unable to hang major exhibitions.
Parker estimates that over the next five years the museum will have
a deficit of about $13 million. &QL;

   When Simon Dickinson opened its doors in the St. James area of
London six years ago and in a small space on the Upper East Side in
New York a year later, it quickly became a leader in Old Master
paintings. Over the years, however, it has branched out,
incorporating 19th- and 20th-century art and building a staff of
experts, most of them former employees of Christie's.
</P>
<P>
   This month the company took another big step. It moved to bigger
quarters in New York, taking over former Newhouse Galleries space
at 19 East 66th Street. Newhouse will still operate from offices
there, but Simon Dickinson is renting the first two floors.
</P>
<P>
   It has also formed a new company, Dickinson Roundell which will
handle its 19th- and 20th-century works. ``We felt that 19th- and
20th-century art had such a strong market here that we had to have
a larger presence,'' said Ian Kennedy, president of Simon Dickinson
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Katz, a leading London sculpture dealer, will also rent

STATE OF THE UNION GOOD FOR PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   That often-repeated Zen riddle about the sound of one hand
clapping has its corollary in Congress:
</P>
<P>
   What is the sound of one side of the aisle clapping?
</P>
<P>
   During President Clinton's State of the Union address on Tuesday
evening, the Democrats made enough noise to offset the pervasive
silence of the elephants that chose to attend and remain throughout
the performance.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Republican silence was not complete. On a few
occasions some did applaud and rise to their feet _ instances when
it would have shown up very badly on television had they not done
so.
</P>
<P>
   Giving credit where due, however, House Majority Leader Dick
Armey appeared to move _ or rather, not move _ to his own surly
drummer. His face transfixed throughout the speech in a mask of
utter disdain, Armey was never caught on camera reacting at all to
any syllable of the president's utterance.
</P>
<P>
   That showed a lot of discipline, because even Armey had to have
realized that Clinton was giving a masterful performance, perhaps
the best of his political career.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the opprobrium that has been heaped up him in recent
months, despite having been impeached by the Republicans in the
House, despite the Republican effort now under way to persuade the
Senate to remove him from the White House, Clinton stood there tall
on the podium in the House and with a strong, unwavering voice
spoke of the nation's ``moment.''
</P>
<P>
   But the speech itself may have been Clinton's moment, the
defining one that may have saved him from the disgrace of being
driven out of office.
</P>
<P>
   It was a speech well calculated to increase _ or at the least
sustain _ the support he has among the American people for a speedy
termination of the proceedings and allow him, his administration
and Congress to get back to the business of government.
</P>
<P>
   It was a speech that promised something for everyone except
those who believe that that government governs best that promises
least. Clinton's promises resonated across America because they
were targeted at areas of escalating public concern: Social
Security, Medicare and health care generally, child care,
education, crime, national security, the environment and equal
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Although no one could reasonably expect that the president could
deliver on all those promises, taken together they composed a
vision for America for the approaching new century.
</P>
<P>
   His enemies have never offered a comparable strategic plan. As
witnessed to by the two Republican respondents to Clinton's
address, they have little more to offer than the tired litany of
tax cuts _ inconsequential ones for average Americans and huge ones
for the rich _ and divisive social issues.
</P>
<P>
   In light of that vision disparity, the president's approval
rating most likely will hold and perhaps grow. That should convince
the Republicans of the wisdom of trying to bring the impeachment
trial to a swift end.
</P>
<P>
   But it wouldn't be advisable to suspend breathing until that
happens. The Republicans appear to be determined to fly in the face
of public opinion in pursuit of their pound of political flesh.
</P>
<P>
   It could be that they believe that they have waded so far into
the swamp that it is just as risky now to try to get out of it as
to wade in deeper.
</P>
<P>
   But for the good of the nation, they should reconsider, and
desist from their determined effort to lower the impeachment
threshold. Constitutional scholar after scholar has said that the
offenses with which Clinton is charged do not rise to that level of
seriousness.
</P>
<P>
   If they insist on dragging this trial out for several more
weeks, the government's ability to function could be seriously
impaired by the resulting hostility between the two parties. That
could have serious economic repercussions and could exacerbate the
disenchantment that growing numbers of Americans are experiencing
with their government.
</P>
<P>
   It has been said repeatedly that the nation and its institutions
will endure regardless of what happens to Clinton. That most
assuredly is true in the long term. But the long term could be a
long time coming.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, things could be plunged into a sorry mess if
the Republicans insist on hauling witnesses before the Senate for a
protracted re-enactment of Capitol Hill's ``Fanny Hill.''

A POLICY ANALYST QUESTIONS WHETHER GUN REGULATIONS ARE SUFFICIENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA McUSIC 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Guns are making a killing in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Gun and ammunition retail sales total about $9 billion annually.
Combined with accessories and gun-related services, the economic
effect is somewhere between $20 billion and $25 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Yet compared with most other consumer products, guns are
virtually unregulated.
</P>
<P>
   Guns are not under the auspices of the Consumer Product Safety
Commission, which regulates the safety of virtually every other
U.S. consumer product. Guns were exempt from the commission when it
was created in 1972 by Rep. John Dingell, who was a board member of
the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   Guns are not included in the Census Bureau's economic census,
which includes data from virtually all U.S. manufacturers,
wholesalers and retailers in surveys taken every five years.
</P>
<P>
   Although guns are lethal products, most adults can buy a gun in
a retail store. If a buyer is a felon, a convicted spouse or child
abuser or a ``mental defective,'' he or she can buy a gun through a
friend or relative.
</P>
<P>
   Those are some of the findings in ``Making A Killing: The
Business of Guns in America'' (The New Press, 258 pages, $25), a
fascinating yet frightening look at the gun industry by Tom Diaz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress has never subjected this lethal industry to the kind
of scrutiny that it has the tobacco industry, the automobile
industry, the airline industry, the funeral home industry, and the
manufacturers and distributors of many other products that threaten
the public health and safety,'' Diaz writes, calling firearms ``the
last unregulated consumer product.''
</P>
<P>
   Diaz, a Georgetown University Law Center graduate, is a former
journalist who specialized in intelligence and counterterrorism
issues. He is a policy analyst for a nonprofit public policy
institute working to reduce gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   Although the gun industry is shrouded in federally protected
secrecy, Diaz uncovered a remarkable amount of data on the industry
and on individual manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   A few giant manufacturers make most of the guns domestically,
Diaz reports. Of the 1.7 million pistols and revolvers made in
1995, Smith &AMP; Wesson manufactured more than 500,000. Of the 1.2
million shotguns manufactured domestically, Remington Arms Co. made
426,442.
</P>
<P>
   All but one of the domestic manufacturers _ Sturm, Ruger &AMP; Co. _
are privately held, making it even more difficult to obtain
information on their ownership, financial data or product data.
</P>
<P>
   The gun picture becomes even murkier when Diaz looks at the
large foreign gun importers.
</P>
<P>
   As the demand for guns in the United States continues to rise
and most other countries continue to restrict firearms, gun
manufacturers abroad see this country as fertile soil for their
products, Diaz writes. Between 1978 and 1996, about 20 million guns
were imported for the U.S. civilian market, he writes. In 1994
alone, 2.2 million guns were imported.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign gun makers work under even less regulation and
accountability, he adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is interesting to note that most, if not all, of the
foreign gun manufacturers who export to the United States cannot
sell their products to civilians at home as freely as they can
here,'' Diaz writes.
</P>
<P>
   The top three gun manufacturers in Japan, for example, export 80
percent of their products to the United States. A Brazilian company
sends virtually all its semiautomatic pistols to foreign markets
such as the United States because Brazilian law forbids civilian
ownership of such guns.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz has scoured numerous sources, including the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; the gun media; firearms industry
associations; and a host of others to pull together a picture of an
industry as it is rarely seen.
</P>
<P>
   He also tackles public policy issues, offering suggestions on
how to take control of an industry cut free of basic health and
safety features to which others are subject.
</P>
<P>
   The book is frightening and enlightening.

   ``Global Investing: A Guide to the Best 50 Stocks in the World''
</P>
<P>
   By Andrew Leckey
</P>
<P>
   Warner Books, $14.99
</P>
<P>
   Many books tell you how to find great stocks. This one actually
names names. Syndicated newspaper columnist Andrew Leckey picked
his 26 foreign stocks and 24 U.S. stocks by analyzing their
financial strength, value, expansion, competitiveness, consistency
and performance, he writes. He says that the stocks are diversified
globally and that investors should buy and hold. Coca-Cola,
Fujitsu, General Electric and other major corporations are featured
in his list.

   ``The Complete Small-Business Sourcebook''
</P>
<P>
   By Carl Hausman and Wilbur Cross
</P>
<P>
   TimesBooks, $27.50
</P>
<P>
   Experience in starting a business can be ``expensive,
inconvenient, and sometimes disastrous,'' write authors Carl
Hausman and Wilbur Cross. ``But learning from the experience of
others is painless and profitable.'' Providing access to
experience, through a directory of information sources, is the goal
behind this book. The authors break up the small business
experience into chapters and subsections on financing, hiring,
etc.; provide brief discussions on the topic; and then list where
to go for help. The format is effective.

CORE INFORMATION ON THE APPLE CIDER LABEL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: What is the difference between apple juice and apple cider?
When I read the labels, they say the same thing: ``filtered water
and apple juice concentrate.''
</P>
<P>
   _ R.W.N., Keller, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Apples can be used to create apple juice, sweet apple cider
or hard apple cider.
</P>
<P>
   Apple juice generally refers to juice that has been treated to
prevent spoilage with a process such as flash pasteurization.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet cider refers to fresh juice that hasn't been exposed to
any preservative methods.
</P>
<P>
   Hard cider refers to juice that has gone through a natural
fermentation process.
</P>
<P>
   Unpasteurized apple juice and cider were associated with three
outbreaks of E. coli bacteria in 1996. Sixty-six people became ill
and one child died, according to the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Current practices for producing apple cider may not be
adequate to prevent microbial contamination,'' according to a Jan.
10, 1997, CDC report. ``Consumers can reduce their risk ... by
drinking pasteurized or boiled apple cider and juice.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I write to Grant Hill, the basketball star with the
Detroit Pistons?
</P>
<P>
   _ M.L., Brookfield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to Hill and any of his teammates in care of the Detroit
Pistons, The Palace of Auburn Hills, 2 Championship Drive, Auburn
Hills, MI 48236.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Hill and his mother, Janet, donated $100,000 to Duke
Divinity School to fund a scholarship that honors his father,
former Cowboys running back Calvin Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Grant Hill, 26, was born in Dallas while his father was a player
for the team. Roger Staubach named him, Hill told GMC Directions
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   After being selected third overall in the 1994 NBA Draft, Hill
has been elected for four straight years to the NBA All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I find ``Everybody Loves Somebody,'' the theme song
from Dean Martin's late '60s, early '70s TV show?
</P>
<P>
   _ K.L.H., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: That song appears on several collections of Dean Martin's
music, according to the online music retailer CDNow.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent releases are ``Everybody Loves Somebody,'' a
two-disc CD collection from Golden Stars, and ``Dean Martin
Greatest Hits'' from EMD//Capitol.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Members of the Upright Citizens Brigade, an
improvisational comedy troupe, took their mops and paint brushes to
the Harmony Theater last weekend and began to scrub the former
X-rated movie house on West 22nd Street in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't doing community service. The 74-seat theater will
now bear the group's name as a result of a two-year lease.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a place definitely filled with personality,'' said Matt
Besser, a member of the group, in the hot pink lobby. ``And we had
to clean out some of that personality.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brigade, which has performed in several spaces, is just the
latest small company to leap into legitimacy with a permanent home.
Consider some other activities this week.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street from the Papp Public Theater, workers were
painting walls and hanging lights at the new Dominion Theater, a
venture of Frog Entertainment, a producing team. The Dominion, at
428 Layfatte Street, is on the site of the old Colonnades Theater
Lab, where Danny DeVito and Michael Douglas once performed. The
Dominion's first production, ``Waiting for the Parade,'' begins
next Friday.

   In the West Village, two little-known companies, the Lost Tribe
Theater Company and the Peccadillo Theater Company, announced that
they had a five-year lease on the Hamlet of Bank Street Theater,
which has 89 seats and a thrust stage. The last big show there was
the musical ``Blood Orgy of the Carnival Queens!'' in 1994. The
companies' productions begin next month.
</P>
<P>
   Even better known producers were getting in on the
small-is-beautiful act. On Wednesday, the producer Julian
Schlossberg (``Power Plays,'' ``The Beauty Queen of Leenane'') said
he had signed a long-term lease on the 99-seat Arclight Theater on
West 71st Street and would use the space to try out new work.
Testing will begin on Feb. 18, with a run of ``Jodie's Body,'' a
minor critical hit in the East Village last summer. The co-producer
is now Gloria Steinem.
</P>
<P>
   And on Theater Row, plans are proceeding for the development of
several new 99-seat theaters. To veterans of Off Off Broadway, the
explanation is simple. ``It all boils down to artistic freedom,''
said Aaron Beall, proprietor of three 99-seat-or-less theaters.
``The old model was to rent and move from space to space. Now
people are willing to trade sweat equity and take the financial
risk to have a home.'' And do what they want when they want.
</P>
<P>
   Other not so small Off Off Broadway operations that have
recently set up shop include the Theatorium, on the Lower East
Side, a 5,000-square-foot raw space operated by the Present
Company, a founder of the Fringe Festival, and Gale Gates et al.,
the granddaddy of them all, a 40,000-square-foot space under the
Manhattan Bridge in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Simpson, the director of the 100-seat Flea Theater, which
opened in September 1997 at 41 White Street, said the Off Off
Broadway boom was an indirect result of Broadway's becoming too
expensive and Off Broadway's being too crowded. There is only one
drawback, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't lose your shirt with 50 seats,'' he said, ``but
won't make any money either.'' &QL;

   Any theater student can tell you that Harold Pinter is
considered brilliant. But is he $1-a-minute brilliant?
</P>
<P>
   The question arises from news that the running time of Pinter's
latest offering, ``Ashes to Ashes,'' is 45 minutes. Tickets for the
show, presented by the Roundabout Theater Company at the Gramercy
Theater, are $48 (half price for those under 18). With a 7:30
curtain, that means audiences will leave the theater while most of
the rest of the city's theatergoers are just settling in.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Richard, the general manager of the Roundabout, said the
company was aware of the brevity of the show and had added nightly
discussions with the audience led by the Roundabout's staff. ``It's
a rich, dense piece of work,'' she said. ``People have a lot to
talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   The play, which is about a troubled marriage and stars Lindsay
Duncan and David Strathairn, opens Feb. 7. &QL;

   Mike Nichols hasn't had a stage credit in New York since 1992,
when he directed Ariel Dorfman's ``Death and the Maiden'' on
Broadway. But that doesn't mean he hasn't been tinkering in a
theater since then.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Nichols is widely known to be an expert script _ and
dance and song and acting _ doctor. And in recent years he has
anonymously added his two cents' worth to the Broadway musical
``The Capeman'' and ``Cakewalk,'' which played in 1996 at the
Variety Arts Theater. (Not, apparently, that it always helped.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, Nichols is back, lending a hand to his friend James
Naughton as he prepares to take his one-man night of song to the
Promenade Theater. The show, which Naughton performed last summer
at the Manhattan Theater Club, opens on Feb. 4.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, Nichols is taking some credit, as a
``presenter'' of the work. Which means?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sort of an investor, a fan, a friend, and if he wants to
know something, I'll tell him,'' Nichols said. ``So far, though, it
just seems ideal.''
</P>
<P>
   Naughton said that Nichols' most important work may have already
been done. How so? Well, the owner of the Promenade, Ben Sprecher,
was considering several other options before Nichols signed onto
Naughton's project.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden we vaulted to the top of the list,'' Naughton
said. ``Having Mike out in front makes people sit up and listen.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Expect an announcement next week on the fate of ``The
Gershwins' Fascinating Rhythm,'' a sexed-up revue of the work of
George and Ira Gershwin that has been drawing hordes of producers
at the Arizona Theater Company in Phoenix. Two options are being
mulled: a tour or a late spring run on Broadway, probably at the
Longacre Theater.
</P>
<P>
   _ A memorial service for Parris Relkin, the former managing
director of the Pearl Theater, will be held at 7 p.m. on Monday at
the theater, 80 St. Marks Place in the East Village. Relkin, 44,
drowned last month on vacation in the British Virgin Islands.

HUMORIST TAKES ON THE PRESIDENCY AND WINS _ SORT OF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just about everyone but Rush Limbaugh would agree that Al
Franken is both politically astute and pretty darned funny. Because
Franken's last bestseller was titled ``Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat
Idiot and Other Observations,'' Sir Rush of the Right is, we must
concede, allowed to despise Franken's every literary innard.
</P>
<P>
   But Franken's wicked sense of humor is just as sharp when the
author/comedian skewers himself, as proved by ``Why Not Me,'' a
look at Franken's imaginary life as America's president. The book
is an indictment of our political system and the candidates,
pundits and voters who have brought it to its current slapstick
state. By placing himself in the insincere, sound-bite-driven midst
of it all, Franken is admitting that he is no better, and possibly
a lot worse, than the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Franken's account of his ``campaign,'' which is
presented in a clever, made-up pastiche of diaries, newspaper and
magazine articles, congressional subcommittee testimonies and
excerpts from an imaginary book by Watergate sleuth Bob Woodward.
It places its protagonist in the presidential campaign of 2000,
which, by noncoincidence, begins in early 1999. The Clinton
impeachment proceedings are over, with the president back in the
Oval Office nursing his slapped wrist. Franken heads to New
Hampshire and Iowa along with other Democratic potential nominees
Al Gore, Bill Bradley, Bob Kerrey and Richard Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   While his opponents front the usual well-oiled political
campaign teams, Franken stumbles along with a clutch of lunatics
including his board-wielding alcoholic brother and ``Grizzly
Adams'' TV star Dan Haggerty. Because he feels behind the learning
curve on real issues, Franken invents one: service charges at bank
ATMs. With a little shady help from insurance executives eager to
get into the banking business themselves, Franken exploits voter
naivete and, through a serious of hysterically funny coincidences,
actually gets voted into office.
</P>
<P>
   Once he is there, of course, it is fiasco time. The Franken
administration gets off to a stumbling start when the new president
uses his inaugural address to discuss outlandish mistreatment of
slaves on Old South plantations. Franken's insistence on allowing
only Jews to serve in his Cabinet creates further furor, but those
apparent waves subside to relative ripples when, in short order,
Franken beats up Nelson Mandela and then heads off to Iraq to
assassinate Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   All these outlandish acts are carried out in front of or in
conjunction with well-known real-life political figures from Dick
Morris (who helps Franken concoct some of his wildest schemes, then
defects to serve as Woodward's latest ``Deep Throat'') to Sam
Donaldson, whose fear of catching a disease from the obviously
addled president takes certain side-splittingly funny forms.
</P>
<P>
   The best political satire plays no favorites; liberals as well
as conservatives will find some of their political sacred cows on
the butcher's block here. If Franken occasionally strays into
tastelessness, that's a small price for the reader to pay. ``Why
Not Me?'' is the sharpest political literary humor since Philip
Roth's ``Our Gang'' in the mid-'70s.

THEY ARE WHAT THEY ARE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Popeye and Olive Oyl, the most unpromising couple since the
breakup of Monica and Bill, are getting married.
</P>
<P>
   After 70 years of dating, the dowdy, anorexic Olive and the
violent, tattooed, unintelligible Popeye have set a date. Next
month, ``The Wedding of Popeye and Olive'' will take place in a
special-edition comic book produced by Ocean Comics, an independent
company under contract to King Features Syndicate.
</P>
<P>
   Did love win out? Is Popeye finally ready to settle down? Did
Olive Oyl inherit a big spinach farm in California? Or are Popeye
and Olive merely the puppets of cunning, greed-head capitalists
looking to make a quick buck? Do the words ``Death of Superman''
strike a familiar note?
</P>
<P>
   ``I really liked the character,'' said Ocean Comics publisher
Bob Palin. ``And I thought I could sell some copies if we did a
wedding. Besides, I think marriage is good for him.''
</P>
<P>
   That remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Bradenton-based marriage counselor Joe Padronaggio warns Popeye
and Olive that their relationship may go through some changes once
they tie the knot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not until a relationship is finalized by marriage that
certain conscious and unconscious beliefs of a husband and wife
manifest themselves. It doesn't matter how long they've been
dating; once they marry, it changes the whole nature of the
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Jane Pavich, another Bradenton marriage counselor, concurred,
adding that qualities or habits the couple found endearing before
marriage may become irritating after marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Popeye's pipe smoking, for instance. Once they're married,
Olive may make him go outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Pavich also speculated that Popeye may grow tired of Olive's
high-pitched voice, which could best be compared to the sound a
seal might make if it stepped on a fire-ant hill or, perhaps, the
music of a young Tiny Tim.
</P>
<P>
   As a sort of early wedding present, Pavich offered the comic
couple a free premarital counseling session where she said she
would stress communication skills, money management and what effect
Olive's Calista Flockhart-like figure might have on her bearing
children.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Popeye and Olive Oyl, any changes they'd care to
make would almost certainly be for the better. Olive might want to
start eating, or have foot surgery so she no longer has to schlepp
around in those size 14-AAAA shoes. Popeye might finally see the
wisdom in a little corrective plastic surgery to fix his chin, open
his eyes and provide him with a mouth. It's doubtful that even the
most skillful surgeon could do anything about Popeye's inverted
arms and legs, but modern medicine is making great strides, so he
shouldn't give up hope.
</P>
<P>
   Other changes might be less welcome. Would the newlyweds adopt
Swee'Pea, the world's only 70-year-old infant? Would they invite
the freeloading Wimpy into their home out of pity? Would the Sea
Hag make a responsible baby sitter?
</P>
<P>
   The wedding, thinks Sarasota Herald-Tribune cartoonist Ralph
Smith, is probably a misguided attempt to drag Popeye and Olive
Oyl, kicking and screaming, into the '90s. After letting the image
of a cell-phone-toting, sport-utility-vehicle-driving Popeye sink
in for a moment, I asked Smith to speculate about Popeye's wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be catered by Wimpy, definitely. The food will be
great if you like hamburgers. Cathy should be Olive's maid of honor
because she's got nothing going on right at the moment and Bluto
should be Popeye's best man.''
</P>
<P>
   But what about the rivalry between Popeye and Bluto? Isn't he
afraid that Bluto might steal the flirtatious Olive at the last
minute?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' said Smith. ``I've always thought of Bluto as
more of a Village-People type. If he were to steal anyone at the
last minute, it would be Popeye.''
</P>
<P>
   Any advice for Popeye on his wedding night?
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering his age, I would suggest he mix a little Viagra in
with his spinach,'' Smith said.

DAVID WOJNAROWICZ: THE TINDERBOX CAREER OF A LEGENDARY TRUTH
TELLER 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Wojnarowicz (1954-1992) was a near-mythic
figure in New York a decade ago, and for many people who knew him,
he still is. Artist, writer, filmmaker and performer, he gained
fame during the brief East Village art boom of the 1980s. But he
kept himself outside the hype and went his own way. He stayed in
the neighborhood after the galleries had moved out, and died there
of AIDS at the age of 38.
</P>
<P>
   It was always hard to categorize him. His image-jammed,
politically charged paintings were too Poplike to fully connect
with Neo-Expressionism. His brooding, mortality-obsessed
photomontages had little to do with Neo-Conceptualism's cool,
ironic consumer critique. Today, in the late 1990s, a becalmed time
for art, he seems hardly to fit in at all.
</P>
<P>
   But at the moment he's back in New York in full force. A
retrospective titled ``Fever: The Art of David Wojnarowicz''
(pronounced vahjnah-ROE-vitch) has opened at the New Museum of
Contemporary Art in SoHo; several Manhattan galleries are showing
his work. A book of excerpts from his diaries has just appeared,
joining a large body of published writing that some consider his
finest achievement in any medium. The retrospective is the main
event, and it's a persuasive one. Although Wojnarowicz's career
spanned barely 10 years, he turned out a prodigious amount of work.
Inevitably, the results were mixed. But Dan Cameron, senior curator
at the New Museum, has both chosen well and given the show a
compelling chronological shape.
</P>
<P>
   In Wojnarowicz's case, art and biography go hand in hand. His
childhood had a nightmare side. His parents were divorced when he
was two. He spent most of his first few years in New Jersey with
his father, a physically abusive alcoholic who eventually committed
suicide. At the age of 9, he looked up his mother's name in a
Manhattan telephone book and moved into her cramped apartment in
Hell's Kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   She sent him to a Roman Catholic school and introduced him to
art; seeing Pavel Tchelitchew's ``Hide and Seek,'' a surrealistic
painting of children hidden in trees, at the Museum of Modern Art
made a big impression. At the same time, secretly he started having
sex for money with men in Times Square, and hustling became a
source of income for years. He read the Beats, left home in his
early teens and took Kerouac-inspired cross-country trips,
recording his picaresque adventures in journals.
</P>
<P>
   He ended up back in Manhattan in the 1970s, a period of
underground cultural ferment. Punk rock was flourishing (he was
part of a club band named ``3 Teens Kill 4 _ No Motive), as was
graffiti art and a hyperactive gay social scene. Old shipping piers
west of Greenwich Village were meeting places for sex, and
Wojnarowicz created some of his earliest art there: cartoonlike
murals of running soldiers, slaughtered cows and burning houses _
images that, in one form or another, recurred later in his work.
Being gay was a central fact _ probably the central fact _ of
Wojnarowicz's life. From it emerged his sense of personal
isolation, his relentless, adversarial anger toward society at
large, and a core of emotional strength that held his ego together.
</P>
<P>
   It also fueled his art, as one sees in his earliest surviving
photographs from the late 1970s. For this series, made with a
beat-up old camera, he asked a lover to wear a portrait mask of the
French poet Arthur Rimbaud, an icon of the gay movement. He then
took pictures of him at various locations around the city _ on a
crowded subway, in front of porn theaters and grocery stores _ as
if to say ``we are everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of Wojnarowicz's heroes were gay writers: Rimbaud, William
S. Burroughs, Jean Genet. And there's a distinctly literary quality
to his art. His paintings, with their deliberate, labor-intensive,
micromanaged look, are far less about formal virtuosity and touch
than about an often playful, free-associative accumulation of
visual and textual metaphors.
</P>
<P>
   Words are everywhere in his work. Paintings from 1983 were done
on supermarket advertising posters; examples are on view in shows
now at Gracie Mansion Gallery and Adam Baumgold Gallery. In later
pieces, texts proliferate and take on both symbolic and painterly
functions, as in ``History Keeps Me Awake at Night (For Rilo
Chimielorzi)'' from 1986, in which the figure of a hit man with a
gun is surrounded by a striking collage of U.S. currency and
ripped-up world maps.
</P>
<P>
   Money and maps are also embedded in the four paintings
collectively titled ``The Elements'' (1987), which are among the
artist's most ambitious works and one of the high points of the
show. Each is a compendium of images, many derived from
photographs, in which the antagonisms that defined Wojnarowicz's
view of the world _ between the organic and the mechanistic, power
and vulnerability, man and nature _ are dramatized.
</P>
<P>
   One painting, ``Fire,'' is a kind of visual tinderbox, filled
with emblems of combustion, explosion and electricity. Another,
``Wind (for Peter Hujar),'' is an expansive pipe dream of a piece
in which babies and soldiers, classical sculptures and pornographic
figures, postnuclear junkyards and fleecy clouds float side by side
in subtle, glancing equipoise, like off-rhymes running through a
poem.
</P>
<P>
   The photographer Peter Hujar, to whom ``Wind'' is dedicated, was
20 years older than Wojnarowicz and a crucial figure in his life,
first as lover, later as mentor and close friend. (Their
relationship is the basis of a show titled ``David Wojnarowicz and
Peter Hujar, Some Sort of Grace'' at P.P.O.W. Gallery in SoHo.)
</P>
<P>
   After Hujar's death from AIDS in 1987 and his own diagnosis,
Wojnarowicz's art changed direction. He kept painting, and the work
from that point on on _ the austere, poignant ``Fear of
Evolution,'' and the paradisal ``Where I'll Go If After I'm Gone,''
with wheels, planets and animals (almost always used as symbols of
vulnerability) floating among tropical trees _ are among his best.
But much of the late work, which is installed on the second floor
of the New Museum, is either primarily photo-based or fully
photographic.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Sex Series (for Marion Scemama),'' with erotic tableaux,
both heterosexual and homosexual, printed as circular insets over
aerial views of cities, dates from this time. So does ``Untitled
(Hujar Dead),'' which combines shots Wojnarowicz took of Hujar's
corpse _ they're reminiscent of a Renaissance entombment _ with a
murderous first-person denunciation of institutionalized
homophobia. This is one of Wojnarowicz's great works, and in a
stroke it answers the question of whether art produced in direct
response to AIDS will enter the history books. It will.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The ``Sex Series'' got Wojnarowicz in trouble with the religious
right when a minister excerpted and reproduced its sexually
explicit images and sent them to members of Congress and to
thousands of clergymen across the country as evidence against an
embattled National Endowment for the Arts. The artist sued for
defamation and won.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his insistence on pursuing this time- and
energy-consuming legal battle, Wojnarowicz wasn't an activist in
the usual sense. For him, political awareness wasn't defined by a
set of specific actions. It was an existential condition, a state
of mind, an irritation that could not be soothed, a kind of moral
insomnia that dictated how one lived a life.
</P>
<P>
   The same was true of being gay. No matter how secure or
protected one might be, or at least feel (Wojnarowicz seems never
to have felt protected), one was obliged to see the world in a
certain way: to question power and track its movements and to
empathize with powerlessness in every form. The fact that
Wojnarowicz was perceived as embodying these attitudes, both in his
life and his art, is surely one of the reasons why from the
beginning he has been held in high regard.
</P>
<P>
   One wonders about the reception of such art today. Political
work is in critical disfavor. And AIDS, the only recent social
issue to have galvanized the mainstream art world into anything
like concerted action (the endowment debacle certainly did not),
has retreated from the headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Given this context, Wojnarowicz's all-or-nothing intensities
might register as artifacts of another era and a different set of
circumstances. Yet anyone seeing the complete picture of his career
that is on view right now in New York, is likely to be pulled in by
its synthesizing intelligence, its visual imagination and its
spiritual passion. These are among the critical ingredients of a
visionary artist. That's what Wojnarowicz was. And visionaries are
as difficult to come to grips with, and as timeless, as they are
rare.
</P>

POPULARITY OF `PROVIDENCE' STUNS CRITICS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Critics don't always share the tastes and
sensibilities of the average viewer. But rarely has that split in
opinion appeared more noticeably than in the case of NBC's new
series ``Providence.''
</P>
<P>
   Airing its third episode at 7 p.m. CST Friday, the family drama
about a big-city plastic surgeon who makes an impromptu return to
her hometown was charged with a number of cinematic crimes _ the
least of which were sappy, ineffective melodrama, listless dialogue
and story lines that, wrote one critic, ``appeared about as
lifeless as the star's dead mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, viewers didn't feel the same disgust. The first
episode, which aired Jan. 8, more than doubled the network's
average audience in its Friday time slot, attracting 19 million
viewers, placing 12th among 116 shows, and pounding each of its
more established competitors.
</P>
<P>
   More impressive, the series refused to tail off, defying the
usual pattern in which viewers sample out of curiosity, see a train
wreck and move on. Viewers actually returned for a second look last
week.
</P>
<P>
   That, coupled with sizable numbers on a night on which adults
are expected to be far from television sets, prompted NBC's
publicity department to fire off news releases referring to
``Providence'' as midseason's first legitimate hit.
</P>
<P>
   Weekly series that critics hate and audiences love, and vice
versa, have long played parts in the ongoing frustration,
confusion, creative mistrust and simmering love/hate relationship
between critic and viewer. But the critical divide here has been at
polar extremes.
</P>
<P>
   Negative reviews were so passionate and so nearly unanimous that
the series creator and executive producer, John Masius, seemed
personally hurt by what he saw as downright attacks _ up until Jan.
8.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, everyone's entitled to their opinion,'' he says. ``For
me personally, there were some reviews I thought, at worst, would
treat the show as benign because it was coming from a sweet place.
And at best, that maybe it would move people.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what I found odd was the vitriol that I read in a lot of
places that I felt was, I don't know, it just felt over the top.
Still, my feeling is that if the people came to see the show
despite the huge negative reviews, it's either one of two things:
Either they were truly moved by the promos, or they don't care
about the reviews, which suggests that maybe what (critics) write
doesn't affect audiences.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds the show's star, Melina Kanakaredes: ``We were surprised,
sure, by the tone of some of the articles. But that's part of the
business. I mean, what can you do? Nothing will be changed because
of that. It's been shot. It's aired. It's out there for everyone to
see. And the viewers are really the ultimate judges, aren't they?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Providence,'' which will air 13 episodes and await a renewal
order for next season, focuses on the return of Dr. Sydney Hansen
to Providence from Los Angeles after her mother dropped dead at her
sister's wedding.
</P>
<P>
   She returns to a colorfully flawed family. There's Jim, her
veterinarian father (Mike Farrell in his first series since
``MASH'') who relates better to his animals than to his children.
Younger sister Joanie (Paula Cale) is an unwed mother (that wedding
was called off) dividing her time between her infant daughter and
her dad's practice. Robb (Seth Peterson of ``Profiler'') is her
shady, opportunistic younger brother.
</P>
<P>
   Concetta Tomei is the dead mother, who is cinematically
reincarnated as a frequent visitor to Sydney's dreams. Leslie Silva
is Dr. Helen Reynolds, director of a clinic where Sydney works, and
the lead character's sounding board and link to outside-the-house
story lines.
</P>
<P>
   Masius admitted to a gut feeling that critics would find the
series somewhat soft around the edges, given their unabashed
enthusiasm for more gritty dramas such as ``NYPD Blue'' and ``ER.''
</P>
<P>
   But some perceived weaknesses in ``Providence'' have turned out
to be strengths. The decision to keep Tomei as a character was
blasted, but Masius considers it a key device to explore another
side of the lead character in front of an audience. The exchanges,
written with humor, deepen both characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally love the dreams,'' says Kanakaredes. ``The
relationship you have with your parents is so significant in the
sense that, sometimes you leave and you're an adult and you come
back, and you're an 18-year-old again, in your Mom's eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Providence'' also deals with universal themes and feel-good
experiences, much in the vein of ``Touched by an Angel,'' though
not as heavy-handedly. (Masius is credited with creating ``Angel,''
but he left the series before the first episode aired.)
</P>
<P>
   Other advantages include its locale, which isn't New York, Los
Angeles or Chicago, and its entry during the midseason.
</P>
<P>
   It arrives like much-needed bench help in a season that has
generated few must-see shows, with an aggressive publicity campaign
by the always-savvy NBC, and the appeal of Kanakaredes, who has
teetered on the brink of stardom ever since she pocketed a pair of
Emmy nominations for work on the daytime soap ``The Guiding Light''
and completed a tour of duty as Jimmy Smits' lover on ``NYPD
Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To be midseason in the television climate is a pure bonus,''
says Masius. ``But I'm also a firm believer in the product. I'm a
firm believer in half-full rather than half-empty. And I think
there's more to be had looking at the show, quite frankly,
regardless of whether or not we had great numbers last Friday or
not. That still suggests that it's a positive viewing experience
for families and for America. People need to see that for
themselves. And they have.''

`THE 50 YEARS WAR: ISRAEL AND THE ARABS': VIVID MIDEAST MEMORIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.)  
 (bl)  
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The five hours of vivid history that begin Sunday on PBS are
delivered through the memories of eminent and obscure Israelis,
Arabs, Americans and Russians, players all in ``The 50 Years War:
Israel and the Arabs.''
</P>
<P>
   Many, like Yitzhak Rabin, Gamal Abdel Nasser and George C.
Marshall, are gone now; some, like Shimon Peres, Jordan's King
Hussein and Henry Kissinger, survive. In new interviews and old
ones, they and many others recapture through striking personal
encounters the alarms and excursions, the brilliant tactics and
fatal miscalculations, the military triumphs and disasters, the
onstage posturings and back-channel intrigue that have gone into
half a century of turmoil in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   It's mainly an Israeli vs. Arab conflict, of course, but here
too are chapters on Arabs vs. Arabs, Israelis vs. Israelis,
Christians vs. Muslims and Americans vs. Russians plotting and
misplotting battles and proposing or disrupting peace. The sharply
edited newsreels, especially the war scenes recorded in Sunday
night's opener, which covers 1948 to 1982, have their usual force.
But the inimitable moments are the memories:
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Secretary of State Marshall, opposing the Truman
administration's support of an Israeli state in 1948, warns the
president, ``I would be unable to vote for you in this coming
election in November.'' Truman comments, ``Well, that was tough as
a cob.''
</P>
<P>
   An Irgun commander tells of the attack on the Arab village of
Deir Yassin: ``So I gave the order: `Before entering a house, throw
a couple of grenades inside.''' A Haganah commander quotes
religious Jews trying to stop the massacre: ``Bastards, murderers,
what are you doing!'' An Arab propagandist admits to spreading lies
about killings of Arab children and rapes of Arab women: ``We must
make the most of this.''
</P>
<P>
   A Soviet official trying to incite Jordan into war with Israel
announces, ``We believed a war could bring us political gains.'' A
cousin of Egypt's King Farouk recalls, ``We thought it was going to
be a pushover'' as Arab armies massed for an attack on the new
nation, but with the Egyptian army halted 20 miles from Tel Aviv, a
commander says, ``Our officers were confused, panic-stricken.''
Farouk, ousted in a bloodless coup by Nasser, tells his captors:
``You ate me for lunch before I could eat you for dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, taking responsibility for Egypt's resounding defeat,
Nasser bursts into tears along with his army chief, an old comrade
whom he soon has arrested.
</P>
<P>
   There are even moments of humor of a sort. King Hussein tells of
almost having his back broken by a couple of aides trying to guard
him from assassins. As the war begins in the Sinai, the Egyptians
have trouble decoding their own codes. ``Well, something must be
going on,'' one general concludes as his planes and tanks are
decimated. Alexander Haig recalls that Kissinger, who had been
looking for Richard Nixon during one of the recurrent crises,
returned to report, ``Holy mackerel, the guy is bowling with his
black dress shoes on.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday night begins with ``Peacemaking, 1970-79,'' another war
and Anwar el-Sadat's dramatic journey to Jerusalem, and ends with
``Land Divided, 1992-98,'' which includes the 1993 Oslo agreement
and the assassination of Rabin. This exemplary exercise in oral
history on the visual medium ends with the ascendancy of Benjamin
Netanyahu, who is now doing battle at home for his political life.
</P>
<P>
   The only certain element in the Middle East tangle is that
television crews can be counted on to continue gathering revealing
firsthand accounts of whatever lies along a notoriously treacherous
road.

FAMILY ACCUSES HOSPITAL OF RACISM IN TRANSPLANT CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LARRY D. HATFIELD and MACKENZIE WARREN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The family of a teen-ager whose imprisoned
father wants to give her his only kidney is urging a hospital to
reconsider its decision not to do the operation, even if it means
transplanting another donor's kidney into the father to permit him
to donate his natural kidney.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the family of Renada Daniel-Patterson, 16,
accused officials at the University of California at San Francisco
Medical Center of racism in deciding that the father-daughter
transplant would violate medical ethics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The child feels that the hospital did not value her black
life,'' the Rev. Lorenzo Carlisle, pastor of the Oakland Community
United Church of Christ, said Wednesday. ``If she would have been
Caucasian, they would have approved this.''
</P>
<P>
   David Patterson, an inmate at Folsom State Prison where he is
serving time for burglary, donated one kidney to his daughter in
1996. He recently offered to give her his remaining kidney when her
body began rejecting the first, prompting debate about the ethics
of such an operation.
</P>
<P>
   The university's Medical Ethics Commission ruled last week that
it would be unethical to take the kidney because it would violate
medicine's most sacred edict, to ``do no harm'' to patients.
</P>
<P>
   Such a donation would force Patterson onto dialysis, a
$40,000-a-year procedure that would have to be paid by taxpayers.
It also probably would shorten his life, medical specialists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although there are instances in which causing harm to one
person to benefit another is justifiable, donating a second kidney
would harm the donor so significantly that there is no ethical
justification for surgeons to do so,'' said the committee chairman,
Dr. Wade Smith, a neurology professor at the university.
</P>
<P>
   He cited the donation of a first kidney or of bone marrow as an
acceptable level of harm.
</P>
<P>
   Although Renada's condition has improved to the point where she
does not need an immediate kidney transplant or dialysis, doctors
said she would inevitably need a new kidney.
</P>
<P>
   She was born with only one kidney and has suffered several
episodes of kidney failure and transplant rejection.
</P>
<P>
   The ethics committee held several meetings in December and
January, including two sessions with members of the family and
their advisers. The university said the mother declined to release
medical information about her daughter that would have allowed the
committee to make a decision about her case.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, members of the committee went ahead because they
believed that the questions raised by the case go to the core of
medicine's ideology to protect the medical, legal and ethical
interests of organ donors as well as recipients, Smith said.

`OLYMPIC GLORY': HEAPING LAURELS ON GLORIOUS WINNERS AND GOOD
LOSERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ High, wide and handsome on a screen as big as all
outdoors, the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano, Japan, are playing an
encore in the documentary ``Olympic Glory'' at Sony Lincoln Square.
</P>
<P>
   Like so much associated with the Olympic Games, this film comes
with a tag: ``The Official Large Format Film of the Olympic Winter
Games.'' So be forewarned. This truth-in-lensing label serves
notice that this lustrous film is not the place to look for
identification of the bitter losers of the United States men's
hockey team who trashed their quarters. Only a scene at a closing
ceremony that shows athletes bearing a banner inscribed ``See You
in Salt Lake City'' prefigures the allegations of impropriety in
site selection that seem to daub the 2002 Winter Games daily with
fresh taint.
</P>
<P>
   Polished and often breathtaking as it is, ``Olympic Glory''
remains the sort of film that serves as a reminder to be thankful
for documentarians who approach their work with inquiring mind and
jaundiced eye.
</P>
<P>
   Produced by Frank Marshall and Scott Swofford, with Kathleen
Marshall as executive producer, Kieth Merrill as director, Thomas
Keneally (the author of ``Schindler's Ark,'' upon which Steven
Spielberg based his film ``Schindler's List'') as writer and Stacy
Keach as narrator, ``Olympic Glory'' rests squarely in the big,
bubbly mainstream of sports documentaries. It revels in the
exultation of victory, extols perseverance and heaps laurels on
good losers.
</P>
<P>
   Hair-raising images that propel viewers down bobsled runs, sound
that heightens the rasp of skis and the thud of bodies against
pristine snow, prose that raises sport to epic levels are all
marshaled to telling effect in this once-over-lightly return to
Nagano.
</P>
<P>
   Here again are the torches carried through snowy landscapes, the
sumo wrestlers massed for ritual at the opening ceremonies, the
awful tumble taken by the Austrian downill skier Hermann Maier, the
victorious United States women's hockey team and graceful, ecstatic
figure skaters like the Americans Tara Lipinski and Michelle Kwan
in a beautiful sequence set to Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Here, too, are athletes like Masahiko Harada, the Japanese ski
jumper, and Bjorn Daehle, the Norwegian cross-country skier,
seeking redemption for falling short of the gold standard in some
of their competitions at the Winter Games in Lillehammer, Norway,
in 1994. Here is also the good-humored Philip Boit, the first
Kenyan to compete in the Winter Olympics and the last to finish in
a cross-country ski race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Olympic Glory'' may be only part of the story, but that part
is pretty.

<P>
   CARS-WILLIAMS-COLUMN-COX (Undated) _ Subaru, the little Japanese
automaker best known in the Snow Belt for its go anywhere, any
time, all-wheel-drive cars, made its first bid for
sport-utility-vehicle customers three years ago with the Legacy
Outback, a beefed-up version of the compact Legacy station wagon
made to look like an SUV. That popular offering, whose TV ads
featured the star of ``Crocodile Dundee,'' was followed by an
Impreza Outback, an SUV station wagon based on the subcompact
Impreza wagon. It, too, has sold well. By G. Chambers Williams III.
</P>
<P>
   ABOUT-CARS-MADZA-NYT (Detroit) _ The radio headline grabbed my
attention: ``Gas prices have dropped to the lowest level in
history.'' While analysts on the newscast pondered whether prices
could drop still further, I had to wonder if small cars, like the
1999 Mazda Protege I was driving at the moment, would soon be
irrelevant. Along with gasoline prices, small-car sales have
plunged, dropping nearly 20 percent in the last two years. Car
buyers are instead opting for large, powerful and comparatively
thirsty sport utilities, pickup trucks and luxury sedans. By
Michelle Krebs.
</P>
<P>
   CAR-SMART-CADILLAC-NYT (Undated) _ Defying the expectations of
analysts and even some of its own executives, General Motors'
flagship Cadillac division hung on to the luxury car leadership
position it has held for nearly six decades by the skin of its
teeth in 1998. By Michelle Krebs.
</P>
<P>
   COXNET-WHEELS-COX (Undated) _ The Ford Windstar is a standout in
the family minivan market with its contemporary styling, ergonomic
interior, attention to quality and safety, and roomy
accommodations. Like the new Honda offering, the new Windstar
offers a pair of sliding doors that are manually or power operated.
</P>
<P>
   SHARP-DRIVING-COX (Undated) _ The term ``platform'' is one
frequently thrown around in automotive circles these days. But if
you ask most consumers what it means when an advertisement or
article states certain vehicles are built on the same platform,
most people are lost. By Linda Sharp.
</P>
<P>
   THE-MECHANIC-COX (Undated) _ Teaching about batteries, starting
and charging systems often directs my attention beyond the normal
textbook theory portion of the class into trade journal
publications pertaining to the subject. By Nora Carter.

THE JOYS AND SORROWS OF LUCIA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the new Met production of Donizetti's ``Lucia di
Lammermoor,'' the heroine goes through the first two acts in a gown
of silvered green, which was the vocal coloring brought to the role
on Wednesday night by Elizabeth Futral in her house debut. The
silver was in her brilliance of tone, accuracy of intonation and
command of ornament, the green in the way her inflection could warm
through, especially on held notes, and in the natural bend of her
rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   A telling instance of her nice rhythmic sense came in the final
section of the first-act aria, where the phrase repeatedly turned
around a pair of high notes. These she placed slightly after the
beat, which was not just musically effective but made it seem that
she was taking possession of her material.
</P>
<P>
   By such means, Lucia became a less passive character than usual
_ not just an object placed in extreme conditions that makes
singing inevitable, but a woman whose joys and sorrows are her own
because their musical expression is hers.
</P>
<P>
   Joining a cast of varying strengths, Ms. Futral provided the
steadiest and most interesting line in the sextet, consistently
gleaming and ominous. And in the mad scene she produced a
performance to fill the stage on which she was exposed alone. She
had paced herself well, and in future performances may have the
confidence to sing a little more strongly in the first act with
Edgardo, as well as to avoid a couple of breaks into chest tone. No
such problems affected her finale.
</P>
<P>
   Her singing was sure, virtuoso and yet still lighted by
humanity; the accompanying flute was not an ideal of pure, white
tone for the singer to follow but rather a foil for her more
embodied luster. Her sound was beautifully controlled and modulated
right up to, if just not quite into, the conclusive high note of
each long section.
</P>
<P>
   Gareth Morrell conducted a performance that became tight after
some slippage between chorus and orchestra in the opening scene.
Anthony Michaels-Moore was a robust Enrico and Ramon Vargas a
ready, vigorous Edgardo.

   ST. AUGUSTINE, Fla. - A campus, particularly one as
breathtakingly beautiful as that of Flagler College here in sunny
Florida, is a serene oasis of youthful bustle and gaiety, a
scholarly world far removed from the bitter warfare of the
congressional impeachment charade.
</P>
<P>
   But underlying the public disgust over President Clinton's
sexual misdeeds and the petty partisanship of his political
inquisitors is a nagging concern that even at Flagler the nation's
young are being dangerously affected by the foolish follies in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The fear is that today's teen-agers and 20-somethings are being
so turned off by the nasty spectacle that they dismiss all
politicians as opportunistic dummies not worth going to the trouble
to vote for or against. Recent conversations with journalism and
public affairs classes and their professors at Flagler confirm this
is indeed a worrisome problem.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, the proportion of young people between the ages
of 18 and 25 who actually go to the polls has been disappointingly
low. Curtis Gans, director of the Center for the Study of the
American Electorate (CSAE), estimates that only 15 percent of the
eligible voters in that age category voted in the 1998 election.
</P>
<P>
   National exit polls taken on Election Day indicate that a mere
13 percent of those 18 to 29 went to the polls, splitting their
votes equally between Democratic and Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   These figures demonstrate a continuing downward trend. In the
1994 election, 16 percent of the 18-25 age group voted.
</P>
<P>
   If this youthful indifference is permanently accelerated by
anger over the excesses and mistakes of the current political
leadership, we will wind up with badly skewed election results that
do not adequately reflect generational differences.
</P>
<P>
   And that would be a shame. Whether our elected leaders are
idiots or faithful representatives of constituent interests depends
on voters paying enough attention to discriminate between the good
and the bad and cast their ballots accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   A pattern of not voting adopted in youth could easily extend
through a lifetime, further depressing an overall turnout that is
already disturbingly low.
</P>
<P>
   CSAE estimates that in 1994, only 38.7 percent of eligible
Americans voted, an overall figure that has remained fairly
constant since 1974. By contrast, in the 1960s voter participation
was considerably higher, in the 46 percent to 48 percent range.
</P>
<P>
   The Flagler students I queried seemed relatively typical of an
age group not yet gainfully employed or responsible for family
well-being, preoccupied with studies and friends rather than
community or civic involvement. They were defensive about the
impression that they don't care about national affairs, insisting
that they simply felt they would not have an impact even if they
did vote.
</P>
<P>
   Those who spoke up did not see lying about sex under oath as
sufficient to justify removing a president from office. And they
did not like the nastiness of the current political posturing.
``Why can't they talk about real issues?'' one asked.
</P>
<P>
   Another student sighed, ``Politicians don't listen to
18-year-olds. Why are we called Generation X, which means nothing,
if they think we're worth bothering with?''
</P>
<P>
   One young woman was so disgusted she wanted to do away with both
political parties and start over with officials who are more
independent, like Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura. She favored someone
fresh and new who she said would not parrot ``the same old stuff.''
The general idea of change, although of no specific direction, was
popular with other students too.
</P>
<P>
   Some said that if they did go to the polls, they would probably
vote against someone or something rather than for anyone. They felt
that the present leadership was boring and irrelevant to their own
lives.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that young people feel their views will not
be heard in distant, isolated Washington. Older adults feel that
way too. Such alienation is inevitable in an enormous nation of
vast geographic contrasts, ethnic diversity and technical
specialization.
</P>
<P>
   The estimated population in 1997 was 267 million individuals,
nearly 20 million more than in 1990. And it was a whopping 88
million more than the 179 million population of 1960, when John F.
Kennedy was elected the first president of the modern era and
inspired and excited the young people of his time.
</P>
<P>
   Can we ever revive that sense of political contact between
generations to motivate young people to vote? Campaigns geared
toward their interests, such as MTV's ``Rock the Vote,'' hold
promise. Politicians who go out of their way to talk directly in a
non-patronizing way to youth groups may make some headway.
Emphasizing college-age concerns like the availability of
scholarships and job opportunities can't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately young people will simply have to grow up, as
their parents did. And maturity means accepting the
responsibilities as well as the benefits of the greatest democratic
society on earth. Let us hope most of them will figure it out in
time.

`THEORY OF FLIGHT' CRASH-LANDS FROM OVERLOAD OF BAD TASTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard (Kenneth Branagh) is a mentally unstable, failed London
painter seized by an irrational notion that he needs to fly _
literally, in the air, so that when we first meet him he's leaping
off a skyscraper sporting makeshift wings.
</P>
<P>
   Jane (Helena Bonham Carter) is a 25-year-old country girl slowly
but steadily dying from some unnamed degenerative muscle disease
and obsessed by the fact that she's still a virgin _ having passed
up her one shot at sex back when she was 17.
</P>
<P>
   In the paper-thin, inspirational comedy, ``The Theory of
Flight,'' this mismatched pair meet cute when he becomes her
one-day-a-week volunteer helper as part of a community-service
sentence imposed on him by a judge after his abortive
building-leap.
</P>
<P>
   At first, it's a bumpy relationship. He wants to do nothing but
spend all his time in his rented barn constructing a primitive
biplane out of junkyard parts. She's moody and uncommunicative and
prefers watching porno CD-ROMS in her bedroom while fantasizing
about Richard Gere.
</P>
<P>
   But can there be any doubt that these two eccentrics will fall
in love and fly together? Not from frame one, and predictability is
the least of the problems of this movie, which must have looked
like a big winner on paper but is decidedly underwhelming on
celluloid.
</P>
<P>
   Both stars are, of course, proven commodities. But each is
acting so far against their respective ``type'' that they're
virtually unrecognizable _ and never generate much romantic
chemistry or any real movie star charisma. At the same time,
neither is especially believable in his or her off-beat part.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hawkins' script _ which the studio brags it rescued from
its ``slush pile'' of unsolicited scripts _ is halfway trying to be
one of those mid-60s ``Swinging London'' comedies that celebrate
eccentricity and rebellion (``Morgan!, ``The Knack,'' etc.).
There's even a slapsticky, speeded-up camera sequence that seems
lifted from a Richard Lester movie.
</P>
<P>
   But the other half of Hawkins' script, which wants to be a
realistic ``affliction drama,'' just doesn't gel with that comedic
purpose; director Paul Greengrass never quite finds the proper tone
to make the film take flight; and he so often seems to be playing
Jane's various physical handicaps for laughs that the whole
experience just leaves a bad taste in the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   The Theory of Flight. Directed by Paul Greengrass. Written by
Richard Hawkins. Cast: Helena Bonham Carter, Kenneth Branagh, Gemma
Jones, Holly Aird. Fine Line. 98 minutes. Rated R for language and
sexual references.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C-

`CHILDREN OF HEAVEN': FOR A PAIR OF SNEAKERS, LONGING, LIES AND A
PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The young hero of Majid Majidi's ``Children of Heaven'' is
played by Mir Farrokh Hashemian, a desolate-looking boy with huge
brown eyes and a way of sending tears suddenly rolling down his
cheeks. Those tears well up with some regularity during this film
about 9-year-old Ali, his younger sister Zahra (Bahareh Seddiqui)
and their scheme for sharing a pair of his tattered sneakers. The
children want to hide the fact that Zahra's shoes have been lost
because this will be a hardship for their parents.
</P>
<P>
   The family's carefully detailed poverty, which reflects the
filmmaker's own childhood experience, colors everything that
happens in this story.
</P>
<P>
   Events in the film are seen through the children's ingenuous
eyes, as is so often and artfully the case in Iranian films. (A
child's-eye view is, among other things, helpful in circumventing
government censors.)
</P>
<P>
   But in the more honest, less manipulative films that this one
resembles _ especially the graceful work of Jafar Panahi (``The
White Balloon,'' ``The Mirror'') _ what the young characters
observe is liable to be more surprising than it is here. In
``Children of Heaven,'' life is sweet despite countless hardships,
and no reality beyond the economic intrudes upon a fairy tale
atmosphere. Only through heavy-handed emphasis does the quest for
new sneakers take on any greater meaning.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Children of Heaven,'' life in Tehran is documented in
everyday detail, from the less desirable potatoes available to
Ali's family to the way a woolen garment is carefully unraveled so
it can be knitted into something else. Eking out a living is
especially tough for a family of Turkish origin living in the
southern part of the city, a neighborhood duly contrasted with a
wealthy area in the north.
</P>
<P>
   One of the film's most elaborate episodes finds Ali and his
father (Amir Naji) undertaking a punishing bike ride so that the
father can seek gardening work among Tehran's rich. It's typical of
Majidi's reliance on the expected that this journey of hope ends in
frustration. And that a lonely rich child materializes out of
nowhere, eager to make Ali his instant best friend.
</P>
<P>
   The film's two young stars are as guileless as possible, even
when the film contrives to turn the shoe issue into its main
dramatic focus. Ali and Zahra meet secretly in the middle of each
school day to pass along the sneakers, but that proves to be no
solution. Zahra is hampered by ill-fitting shoes at the rigorous
girls' school that she attends. (The film is a production of Iran's
Institute for the Intellectual Development of Children and Young
Adults, so all school scenes look beneficial and wholesome.)
</P>
<P>
   And Ali, against all odds, determines to run a long-distance
race and win the third-place prize of running shoes for Zahra. Not
since Rocky left the boxing ring has a sporting contest been filmed
as momentously as this school race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children of Heaven'' does provide a kindly, enveloping sense
of Iranian life and customs, from the way the family prepares sugar
cubes to be served at a mosque to the way Zahra helps care for
elderly neighbors. These moments come more easily to Majidi than
his studiously bittersweet ending for what is, despite its surface
bleakness, an essentially sunny story.
</P>

SPORTS DEFICIENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Thursday Jan. 28)  
 By MARY J. LOFTUS   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here, in the month of the Super Bowl, I have a confession to
make: My husband and I are raising a sports-deficient child.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, not that we don't tote him to soccer on Saturdays, or throw
a Nerf football around the back yard. He's had plenty of experience
with ragtag and kickball.
</P>
<P>
   This winter, we've signed him up for a neighborhood tennis team
that will officially give him a lawn tennis junior class
``ranking.'' He saw ``Space Jam,'' and knows Michael Jordan just
retired ... again. He's got a few baseball cards.
</P>
<P>
   But, other than that, we are sports illiterate.
</P>
<P>
   We can't spout statistics about RBIs or name MVPs. We wouldn't
recognize most of the people on the cover of Sports Illustrated.
And we don't watch any sports TV, although we do drink Gatorade a
lot.
</P>
<P>
   I went to college at the University of Florida, and lived in
East Hall, a quick sprint from Ben Hill Griffin stadium. Did I go
to the Gator games? Only once, to see the Florida A&AMP;M band play at
halftime. And Gator Growls, for the comedians.
</P>
<P>
   Did I ever admit this after graduation? Only rarely. I would
usually smile and nod and say ``Go, Gators'' when appropriate. But,
in reality, I never associated myself with my college's football
team. And I didn't understand the 98 percent of the populace that
did.
</P>
<P>
   What did those 22-plus guys, athletes recruited for their
offensive skills or defensive prowess, have to do with me? If they
won, good for them. And, I suppose, good for the university, where
rich alumni bought skyboxes and sponsorships galore after a winning
season like 1986.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if I could take any credit for it. So, instead, I'd
go to the nearly deserted library and study.
</P>
<P>
   And I feel even less allegiance to professional teams that
happen to be based in the city where I live. The Atlanta Braves
might get Jane Fonda and Ted Turner going, but they are just
another bunch of pro-athletes to me.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I have friends who live and breathe college and
professional games. They go to their alma mater for the big home
games, watch the others on the tube and root as if the health and
happiness of all their descendants depended on the outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   This is complicated by the fact that one of the couples, both
lawyers, are die-hard fans of enemy camps: UF and FSU. They were
buying their son and daughter baby Gator and baby Seminole outfits
before they could walk, and taught them the fight songs along with
their ABCs.
</P>
<P>
   They take their football seriously, which causes a few family
rifts in season.
</P>
<P>
   I try to understand this. I really do.
</P>
<P>
   But, at the risk of sounding like Bob Newhart in one of his
earliest comedy routines, it's a strange world to me, filled with
emotions I can't conjure up for a game a bunch of other people are
playing.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I think one of the reasons I married my husband was
that he was as clueless as I about who was playing in a Sugar Bowl,
Orange Bowl, World Series or World Cup. So you just had to know our
children would be doomed.
</P>
<P>
   Sports talk does matter, after all.
</P>
<P>
   I found my ignorance to be a slight handicap at work, where
sports news was often the warm up to editors' meetings. The sports
section makes up one-fourth of the newspaper, after all, and many
believe it to be the most interesting part.
</P>
<P>
   I'm famous around my former newsroom for writing ``Newt'' Rockne
in a feature article once that mentioned the football star.
Thankfully, the error was caught by a more well-rounded editor and
the proper ``Knute'' substituted before it made print.
</P>
<P>
   My mom is a big Bucs fan, and my dad watches NBA games whenever
he can, so I had hopes that my son might spontaneously develop a
competence in the lingo, if not an obsession with the games.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not looking good for him already, at the tender age of
7.
</P>
<P>
   We happened to be leaving a Sunday performance of ``Cats'' at
the old Fox Theater in Atlanta's midtown just as the Falcons game
ended in their favor.
</P>
<P>
   Ushers held up hastily scrawled cardboard signs as the crowd
surged through the doors: Falcons won, 30 to 27.
</P>
<P>
   Ecstatic cheers rang out from each new wave of the audience as
they passed into the lobby, and these were theater-goers who had
chosen to miss the game to see ``Cats.'' How big of fans could they
be?
</P>
<P>
   As we exited onto the street, cars were honking and people were
waving while hanging out open windows and sunroofs. ``We're goin'
to the Super Bowl; we're goin' to the Super Bowl,'' chanted one
man, dancing down the street with his date.
</P>
<P>
   Adam looked around quietly, taking it all in. Then he rolled his
eyes at me. ``Geez, it's just a football game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't help but smile. ``Yeah, I know,'' I said. ``But it's
still kind of neat. Hey, we move someplace, and their team makes
the Super Bowl. Maybe we brought good luck to them.''
</P>
<P>
   He looked at me as if I had gone insane. ``Right, mom,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, it was worth a shot.

 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The semi-annual Television Critics
Association meeting winds down today, the end of two weeks of TV
executives spinning like mad and TV stars on their best behavior _
most of the time. Occassionally, some interesting statements slip
through. Here's some of the best of what was said:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``I don't think of myself in any way as a genius, but in
Hollywood I feel pretty special.'' _ Lucy Liu, who plays Ling on
``Ally McBeal.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``I could never do anything this twisted.'' _ ``X-Files''
creator Chris Carter on the impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``I can find different ways of considering myself
unsuccessful.'' _ ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' sad-sack star Ray
Romano, on his show's improving ratings.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``When I got my cavity filled, it still hurt.'' _ Camryn
Manheim of ``The Practice'' on winning her Emmy.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Scud missiles couldn't find us.'' _ ``3rd Rock From the
Sun's'' Jane Curtin, on what happened to the audience when the show
moved to Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``We get all the Depends business we need. . . . We were going
to do `World's Scariest Grandmothers,' but we didn't think it would
work.'' _ Leslie Moonves, president of CBS, on its older audience.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``We must remember that less sex is not no sex, and I
certainly hope we can have some sex on NBC or I'll be out of a
job.'' _ ``Just Shoot Me's'' Wendie Malick on NBC president Scott
Sassa's pledge to reduce sex on his network.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Although for me, less sex would be no sex.'' _
``NewsRadio's'' Jon Lovitz, on the same topic.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The best thing about animated characters is they can't get
bored and want to run off and make movies or quit on you.''_ Fox
entertainment president Doug Herzog's on his network's animated
shows.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``I'm named after the hat check girl at the officer's club at
Rammstein Air Force Base.'' _ Actress Shawnee Smith of ``Becker,''
sort of explaining her name.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``If a frog had pockets, he'd carry a handgun.'' _ CBS News
anchor Dan Rather, apropos of something or other.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``In the future there's going to be 5,000 networks, and UPN is
still going to be in last place.'' _ ``Simpsons'' creator Matt
Groening on his upcoming series ``Futurama.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``If Jennifer (Grey) were found dead, face-down in a pool of
her own vomit on Hollywood Boulevard, it would really help the
show.'' _ Producer Peter Mehlman on promoting his new ABC sitcom
``It's Like ... You Know,'' which stars Jennifer Grey.
</P>
<P>
   SEEN AND HEARD
</P>
<P>
   Getting jobs at CNN
</P>
<P>
   CNN has made a couple of major hires. Charlayne Hunter-Gault
will become the network's Johannesburg, South Africa, bureau chief
starting in April. Most recently the chief Africa correspondent for
National Public Radio, she's also known for her years on PBS' ``The
NewsHour With Jim Lehrer,'' for which she won numerous awards.
</P>
<P>
   And Mike Boettcher returns to CNN as a national correspondent,
starting in February. Boettcher most recently has been a
correspondent for NBC, going back to the Persian Gulf War, but
before that he was a CNN national security correspondent.
</P>
<P>
   Ford talking to ABC
</P>
<P>
   While Diane Sawyer and Charles Gibson do temporary duty to stop
the bleeding on ABC's ratings-challenged ``Good Morning America,''
the alphabet network continues to zero in on NBC's Jack Ford for a
permanent anchor role. The ``Weekend Today'' co-anchor is locked up
at NBC through the summer, but he recently talked again with ABC
News honchos about his future. When his deal comes up, the peacock
network will probably not have a comparable job to offer him.
</P>
<P>
   People joining NewsStand
</P>
<P>
   There's been talk at CNN ever since its ``NewsStand'' franchise
was conceived that People magazine might someday join the lineup,
and it will _ as an 11-week limited series. ``NewsStand: People
Profiles'' will air at 10 p.m. Tuesdays starting March 23 and will
be keyed to the magazine's 25th anniversary, a celebration of
people who changed pop culture. No word yet on who will host.
</P>
<P>
   `Lateline' moving
</P>
<P>
   NBC's comedy ``Lateline'' will get a better shot at ratings
March 16 when it moves to 8:30 p.m. Tuesdays after ``3rd Rock From
the Sun.'' The critically acclaimed sitcom began its second season
at 9 p.m. Wednesdays opposite ABC powerhouse ``The Drew Carey
Show.'' ``Lateline'' will have its final Wednesday airing next week
before it moves to Tuesdays after the February sweeps. Creator/star
Al Franken had publicly blistered NBC for the Wednesday time slot.
</P>
<P>
   ``TalkBack Live'' town meeting
</P>
<P>
   CNN will have a special weekend edition of its ``TalkBack Live''
public forum at 2 p.m. Sunday, a live town meeting about the
impeachment trial. Participants will begin seating at 1 p.m. in the
CNN Center Atrium. Bobbie Battista hosts.

`PLAYING BY HEART': A CHORUS OF `I LOVE YOU'S' IN CRUCIBLE OF
ROMANCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Talking about love is like dancing about architecture,'' muses
a character in ``Playing by Heart,'' a likably sappy romantic
comedy that suggests Robert Altman's ``Short Cuts'' dipped in
chocolate, sprinkled with sugar and neatly tied up with ribbons and
bows into a shiny Valentine's Day package.
</P>
<P>
   That quotation, along with the term ``anger ball'' and many
urgent protestations of ``I love you'' uttered by people who hardly
know one another are among the refrains in a movie that also
suggests a much glossier star-studded West Coast answer to last
year's ``Next Stop Wonderland.''
</P>
<P>
   The film, written and directed by Willard Carroll, jumps around
among an assortment of attractive Angelenos of varying ages, in
various stages of relationships, as they collide and clash and
eventually (in most cases) succumb to Cupid's insistent arrows with
alarming speed. It isn't until very late in the movie, which has
been edited within an inch of its life, that you discover the many
characters' connections to one another, which until then have been
coyly concealed.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Playing by Heart's'' mosaic structure is Altmanesque and
its hothouse romanticism reminiscent of Alan Rudolph, it has far
fewer quirks than those directors' films. A highly buffed soap
opera seasoned with bon mots, ``Playing by Heart'' is determined to
leave us feeling good. Much of Carroll's dialogue feels so worked
over that you have the sense of individual words weighed, measured,
manicured and held up in the light, then fitted into an intricately
designed, unabashedly glitzy piece of merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   The core of the film is a series of interlocking duets. Sean
Connery and Gena Rowlands play Paul and Hannah, a long-married
couple (she runs an award-winning television cooking show that he
produces) who are avoiding dealing with the recent discovery that
Paul has an inoperable brain tumor.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of facing the situation, they carry on an elaborate
squabble over a long-extinguished romance Paul had with another
woman 25 years earlier. Confrontations that are meant to wring
tears from a stone feel false and contrived, and Connery's upper
lip remains so stiff it seems frozen. He delivers his lines as
though rehearsing Shakespeare, and his Scottish accent seems
vaguely out of place.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Burstyn and Jay Mohr are more compatible as Mildred and
Mark, an attractive widow and her gay son in the final throes of
AIDS. But since the same situation has been dramatized more
powerfully in several other recent films and television dramas,
their mutual confessions sound rehashed.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the movie focuses on three younger couples. Gracie
(Madeleine Stowe), who is married and conducting a feverish affair
with Roger (Anthony Edwards), stridently harangues him with her
insistence that their bond is strictly physical.
</P>
<P>
   The film's most prominent budding romance finds Meredith
(Gillian Anderson), a tense, relationship-phobic theater director
pursued by Trent (Jon Stewart), a funny, easygoing guy whom she
initially rejects because he's ``too good to be true.'' These two
are given the smartest screwball dialogue. Finally, there is Joan
(Angelina Jolie), a brashly aggressive aspiring actress who puts
the moves on Keenan (Ryan Philippe), a morose, solitary young man
she meets in a disco who rebuffs her advances.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Quaid plays the film's most mysterious character, Hugh, a
haunted barfly who goes from club to club regaling sympathetic
strangers with a different sob story in each watering hole. His
final experiment in fiction finds him in a drag bar where it's not
so easy to fool patrons who have a special knowledge of
manufactured illusion.
</P>
<P>
   For all its artificiality, ``Playing by Heart'' percolates with
an earnest charm. Much of that sweetness emanates from Ms. Jolie,
who conveys the vulnerability beneath the hard-shell glamour of a
restless leonine beauty prowling the L.A. singles scene.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere of glamorous artifice is enhanced by Vilmos
Zsigmond's picture-postcard cinematography, which measures the
passage of time by artfully dissolving night skies into morning
horizons and makes everybody look smashing. John Barry's romantic
score, inflected with the same trumpet echoes that resound through
Mark Isham's music for Rudolph's films, deepens the mood of upscale
Hollywood dreaminess.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, very little of ``Playing by Heart'' smacks of reality. Best
to think of it as a smartly constructed modern drawing room comedy
set in an urban lotus land where every morning promises a
Valentine's Day surprise. &QL;

Falcon and Sal Magluta on charges of smuggling 75 tons of cocaine

research. He was a peer. At the time, no one knew just how much of
a peer he was. Miguel Moya, 36, was charged with taking a bribe to
rig the verdict, money laundering, tax evasion and witness
tampering after the duo's 1996 acquittal. (Staletovich, Palm Beach

   NEW YORK _ They are, in the words of the flashy Swedish second
wife of one of them, ``an old hat.'' They are the ex-members of
Strange Fruit, the fictitious, once hot English rock band that has
disappeared into seemingly well-deserved oblivion. But in ``Still
Crazy,'' the group members grudgingly reunite 20 years after they
last dropped acid in a Druid circle, and the results are meant to
be both funny and heartwarming. Not an easy mix, unless Spinal Tap
really is your idea of a band that needs a second chance.
</P>
<P>
   As directed by Brian Gibson, whose other music-related features
were the more sharply etched ``What's Love Got To Do With it?'' and
``Breaking Glass,'' this film certainly does have the cast, the
moves and the character names (``Keith,'' ``Brian'') for a
rock-dinosaur story.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Rea amusingly plays the keyboard player, Tony, who still
affects his 70s swagger while working as a contraceptive salesman
in Ibiza. Tony starts the reunion plan rolling by getting back in
touch with Karen (Juliet Aubrey), who has undergone the film's most
striking tranformation. Long ago a babe who worked with the band,
Karen now has a corporate job that requires her to wear a necktie,
which she's happy to lose once a Fruit renaissance looks like it's
in the works.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other blokes on board are Billy Connolly as the
group's onetime wild man, Timothy Spall as its beer-bloated
oblivious type and Bill Nighy as the self-important singer who got
rich enough for the Swedish wife (Helena Bergstrom, quite funny and
apparently voted best actress of the century by Swedish television
viewers) and showy mansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The house has much history,'' the wife explains. ``Queen
Victoria slept here and so did Steve Winwood.''
</P>
<P>
   This film would have been a perfect hoot if more of the
screenplay by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, who wrote ``The
Commitments,'' had sounded like that.
</P>
<P>
   But too much of it is seriously concerned with the onetime
stars' self-doubt, secret hopes and unlikely chance for a new
beginning, with all the sentimental baggage that entails. The
film's satirical possibilities quickly take a back seat to this
relatively drab aspect, and its behind-the-scenes insights aren't
fresh enough to make it work as a real drama.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the mystery surrounding a long-vanished band member,
played by Bruce Robinson (who also wrote ``In Dreams'') as the
film's closest-looking approximation of a 70s star, holds much in
the way of surprise and emotion. Far more nostalgic are quaint
references to groupies' crafts projects, ``that dirty-sweet Marc
Bolan thing'' and other blasts from the rock-and-roll past.
</P>
<P>
   Substantial behind-the-scenes talent (from musicians including
Jeff Lynne and Mick Jones) went into a set of songs for the
resuscitated band, who eventually squirrel up the nerve to board a
tour bus and take their show on the road. Still, they sound tepid,
leaving the film one more wistful note where a laugh would have
been more welcome. &QL;

`CBS SUNDAY MORNING' CELEBRATES 20 YEARS WITH CUSTOMARY GRACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not as if ``CBS Sunday Morning'' has gone unrecognized. The
show has won enough Emmys, Peabodys and other pieces of metal and
glass to provide the average hotel with a complete supply of
doorstops.
</P>
<P>
   The thing is this: ``CBS Sunday Morning'' is so good it ought to
be on in prime time. Then again, it wouldn't be ``CBS Sunday
Morning,'' and it probably would cease being better than breakfast
in bed.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Heyward, the head of CBS News, is proudest of the show
for having ``a distinctive and individual voice.''
</P>
<P>
   The 90-minute broadcast unfailingly provides, in the carefully
chosen words of host Charles Osgood, ``a leisurely and literate
pause'' between the hectic and the chaotic. Regular watchers know
its features and contributors as well as they know the bare spots
in their lawn, the freckles on their kids' faces.
</P>
<P>
   In a few months, Osgood will celebrate his fifth anniversary on
the show, which is observing its own 20th anniversary this Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for me to believe now ... that I've really done it
for one quarter of its existence,'' Osgood said. ``That is
something that I find difficult to adjust to because I have the
feeling that I just got there.''
</P>
<P>
   Osgood lays all praise at the feet of the late Charles Kuralt,
who founded the show with producer Shad Northshield. He says he was
happily devoting his energies to radio when he got the call to
replace Kuralt, who retired in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't have been more surprised to have been chosen to
succeed him,'' Osgood said. ``For one thing, I'm older than he was.
Not by very much, but by a year or so.''
</P>
<P>
   Now in his mid-60s _ he turned 66 on Jan. 8 _ Osgood says he's
happily available to do the next 20 years of ``Sunday Morning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What the heck!'' he mused. ``If Rather can keep adding to his
responsibilities, there's no reason why I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   And who wouldn't want to be associated with such a winner? From
its outset, ``CBS Sunday Morning'' has managed to cover current
events with class and dignity, while also finding plenty of time to
explore the world of fine art and music, nature and science, sports
and everyday Americana.
</P>
<P>
   Some viewers can't wait for the ``Postcard'' segments, expanded
to include such writers as Pam Houston and Barbara Kingsolver.
Others eagerly anticipate the music pieces with pianist Billy
Taylor and flutist Eugenia Zukerman. Some aren't satisfied until
media critic John Leonard has had his erudite say. And millions
can't begin their Sundays without the two-minute ``Nature'' spot,
always aired free of human interruption at the end of each show.
</P>
<P>
   Not that ``CBS Sunday Morning'' looks the same as it did two
decades ago. The set is different, the anchor is different, and
there are other new faces, new wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been trying to evolve and be current,'' said executive
producer Missie Rennie. ``What we're really striving to do is
present a show that five or 10 years from now, somebody else is
pulling from the archives and saying, `This is an extraordinary
piece, an extraordinary story, and it deserves to go on television
again.'''
</P>
<P>
   Since last September, Rennie has been doing her own spelunking
in the archives so the show can present ``Sunday Best'' each week.
</P>
<P>
   Because they're so well written, the older pieces hold up well,
and Rennie said they'll continue to air occasionally beyond
Sunday's anniversary show because viewers have said they love them.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers love everything about ``CBS Sunday Morning'' because
it's intelligent without being pedantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our assumptions,'' Osgood said, ``is that we're not
smarter than the audience. In fact, I think, on `Sunday Morning,'
if you're there for a while, you quickly come to the conclusion
that the audience is smarter than we are.''

 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ It is one of the more unusual shooting schedules in
film history.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week, Robert Zemeckis has begun shooting
``Castaway,'' with Tom Hanks as a man who works for an
international company like Federal Express. En route home with a
gnawing toothache, the Hanks character is riding on a plane that
crashes on a deserted island.
</P>
<P>
   Hanks survives (of course) and, using primitive means, removes
his tooth. He blacks out. The picture fades to black. And when
viewers see Hanks again, it's months and months later. And he's
emaciated. How does an actor make the physical transformation?
</P>
<P>
   Hanks and Zemeckis, who both won Academy Awards for ``Forrest
Gump,'' will shoot the film for about eight weeks, then stop.
Zemeckis will then go off to make another movie, ``What Lies
Beneath,'' a supernatural thriller with Harrison Ford and Michelle
Pfeiffer.
</P>
<P>
   Hanks is to lose 40 or 50 pounds, maybe even more. He may also
move into another project, ``Dino,'' about Dean Martin. And
sometime in 2000, an extremely thin Hanks, and Zemeckis, will fly
to a remote Fiji island to resume ``Castaway.''
</P>
<P>
   The film, written by William Broyles, is basically a survival
story. ``The Tom Hanks character has to emotionally and physically
survive many years of loneliness,'' Zemeckis said. ``He doesn't
have anything to eat but fish and coconuts. Tom had to transform
his body.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanks lost a lot of weight for his role as a lawyer with AIDS in
``Philadelphia,'' which earned him an Academy Award. But this film
will require him to change his physical appearance in front of the
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to do things this way,'' Zemeckis said. ``There's no
way to hide the different looks of his body. When Tom read this, he
said: `This is a great story, but how do you do it? How do you show
a modern guy in a movie becoming emaciated?' This is what we came
up with. It will end up being believable because it's so real.''
</P>
<P>
   The film, a joint project of Dreamworks and 20th Century Fox, is
expensive; it will possibly cost as much as $100 million. One
reason is that most of the crew will have to be kept on the payroll
during the long hiatus.
</P>
<P>
   There may well be cases in which a film with a top star and
director deliberately halted in midstream to make other films and
then resumed months later with the star in different physical
shape. But no one could quite recall any. Zemeckis said he had one
concern: that Hanks' weight loss not dominate the publicity for and
interest in the movie. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tom Sizemore has been one of Hollywood's favorite tough guys,
usually playing a police officer or a thief. But now the
35-year-old character actor, who has appeared in ``Devil in a Blue
Dress,'' ``Heat'' and ``Natural Born Killers,'' and starred as John
Gotti in NBC's ``Witness to the Mob'' last May, is moving on to
more formidable roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's starting to get wider for me,'' he said. ``I'm being
offered more sensitive tough cats, guys who've been through a
violent episode or two and had a propensity to violence but now
come down on the side of good.''
</P>
<P>
   Sizemore had one of the top roles in Steven Spielberg's ``Saving
Private Ryan,'' playing Sergeant Horvath, the man who had fought
side by side for years with Captain John Miller, played by Tom
Hanks. Sizemore said the character was a composite based on
soldiers who landed in France in the first wave on D-Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a quiet man; he was taciturn; he followed orders, and
he loved the captain,'' Sizemore said. ``If he had a tragic flaw,
it was that he didn't know when he had had enough, when it was time
to say, `I can't do this anymore.' The Sergeant was, like a lot of
people I play, a very complicated guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sizemore's own life has been a little complicated. He grew up in
blue-collar neighborhoods in Detroit, where his father, Tom, taught
philosophy at Wayne State, and then attended the University of
Michigan Law School. But Sizemore said his family background was
bleak; several uncles have been in and out of prison on drug and
prostitution charges. ``I come from a very mixed bag,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At 14, Sizemore saw Martin Scorsese's ``Taxi Driver'' and read a
biography of the actor Montgomery Clift.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost immediately, I knew I wanted to be an actor, but I had
to keep it secret,'' he said. ``I was from the east side of
Detroit. It was not something you said you wanted to do. It would
be akin to me saying I want to go to the moon on the next flight.''
</P>
<P>
   Sizemore studied acting at Wayne State, earned a master's of
fine arts degree at Temple University in Philadelphia and then
moved to New York in the mid-1980s to pursue a stage career.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked as a waiter at O' Henry's _ it's now a Gap in the
Village _ I worked for Great Performances, a catering company, I
sold The New York Times over the phone, cold-calling people from
the phone book,'' Sizemore recalled.
</P>
<P>
   A casting agent saw him in the Off Broadway revival of ``The
Indian Wants the Bronx,'' by Israel Horovitz. This led to a small
role in Oliver Stone's ``Born on the Fourth of July.'' His film
career soon took off.
</P>
<P>
   Sizemore recently completed Scorsese's ``Bringing Out the
Dead,'' appearing opposite Nicolas Cage. The two play burned-out
paramedics in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Sizemore said that in some ways he can't believe his good luck.
He lives with his wife, Maeve Brennan, an actress on the daytime
soap opera ``The Bold and the Beautiful,'' in a hillside home in
the Benedict Canyon area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's right down the corner from where Monty Clift had his
famous car accident, which disfigured his face,'' Sizemore said.
``He was one of my favorite actors. I drive by there a lot.'' &QL;

   At 65, Michael Caine said with a laugh, he is entering a new
phase in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm into my Lee Marvin period,'' he said. ``Lee made his
biggest success when he was over 40.''
</P>
<P>
   Caine, an international star who has appeared in more than 70
pictures, acknowledged that in recent years he has been annoyed and
a bit baffled by the movie business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do a picture for about two and a half years,'' he
said. ``I just didn't want to. I got fed up. I kept getting scripts
and was wondering, `Who wants to do these movies?' I was getting
the numbers but not the quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Caine said he enjoyed not working as a film actor for a
time, the shortage of decent scripts began to bother him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was worrying,'' he said. ``And after a while, if you don't
work, you wonder if you can act anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Caine, who was speaking over the telephone from a Beverly Hills
hotel, is in town from London for the Golden Globe Awards over the
weekend. He was nominated for his role as Ray Say, a sleazy and
unsuccessful talent agent in ``Little Voice,'' the Mark Herman
drama about a nearly mute young woman played by Jane Horrocks who
magically transforms herself, imitating legendary stars like Judy
Garland and Marilyn Monroe in the privacy of her attic room and
later onstage.
</P>
<P>
   Caine said he took the secondary role in the film because the
script was so strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``People keep asking me if I identify with the agent,'' he said.
``No, I don't identify with the agent. I identify with the young
girl. When we're young, we're all trapped into this room where we
don't want to talk to anyone. She found her voice in impersonating
these famous people. Her own success is that she finally found her
own voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Caine has been nominated for acting awards for his roles in
``Alfie,'' ``Sleuth,'' ``Educating Rita,'' ``Dirty Rotten
Scoundrels'' and ``Hannah and Her Sisters.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point in his career, Caine said, he is hardly concerned
about taking a secondary role in a film, so long as it is a good
role and the film is first-rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are too many films that are star pieces _ you get the
big star, and they can't afford anything else,'' he said. ``You see
it all the time. People who are not up to it, supporting the big
star. In `Little Voice,' which I loved, it wasn't a star vehicle.
It was a group effort, which I rather liked.''
</P>
<P>
   Caine is also a highly successful restaurateur. With partners,
he owns six restaurants in London, including Langan's Brasserie,
Langan's Bistro and Odin's. He has also opened a restaurant in
Miami Beach, the South Beach Brasserie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hobby,'' he said. ``Some actors have golf. I have
restaurants.''

   SAN FRANCISCO _ More than a year after a Louisiana gambling
investigation forced Edward J. DeBartolo Jr. to give up control of
the San Francisco 49ers, prosecutors are not close to bringing the
main suspect to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Former Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards is accused of masterminding
a scheme to milk $2.5 million in bribes and kickbacks from casino
license applicants. Among those applicants was DeBartolo, who has
said he paid the former governor $400,000 to ensure that he would
get a license.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, a Democrat, continues to practice law and goes about
his business more or less as usual in Baton Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 6, DeBartolo pleaded guilty to the felony charge of
failure to report an alleged extortion attempt by Edwards. He was
fined $1 million and, as a condition of two years probation, agreed
to testify for the government against Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is unclear when Edwards, who has pleaded not guilty,
will stand trial. Consequently, National Football League
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue might be persuaded to reinstate
DeBartolo before his full involvement in the investigation is
revealed at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo, who turned the 49ers' reins over to his sister,
Denise DeBartolo York, in late 1997, is in professional limbo, and
the team's front office has been unsettled.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo, 52, has asked Tagliabue to let him retake control of
the team.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, 71, his son Stephen and four close associates were
indicted in November on 34 counts of racketeering and conspiracy
for allegedly manipulating the award of riverboat gambling casino
licenses and extracting kickbacks from license seekers.
</P>
<P>
   Since Edwards' indictment, the case has bogged down in a gumbo
of motions.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy U.S. Attorney James Letten, who will try the case against
Edwards, said Tuesday that he had no idea when the trial would
start. He said U.S. District Judge Frank Polozola ``hasn't even set
a date for setting a date.''
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue launched his own inquiry into the DeBartolo case in
late October, sending investigators to Baton Rouge to pore over the
49ers owner's Louisiana gambling records. The results of that
inquiry have not been released, but they are expected to determine
whether DeBartolo can regain control of his team, one of the NFL's
premium franchises.

`THE CRIME OF SHEILA MCGOUGH'': TRUTH REMAINS ELUSIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``The Crime of Sheila McGough,'' Janet Malcolm continues the
iconoclastic and overdetermined crusade that she began in her
much-discussed two last books, ``The Journalist and the Murderer''
and ``The Silent Woman: Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes.'' In the two
earlier works (both serialized in The New Yorker), Ms. Malcolm
likened journalists to confidence men who betray their subjects
without remorse, while biographers are like ``professional
burglars,'' plundering the lives of their subjects for their own
purposes. The work of both, she maintained, inevitably involves the
creation of narratives that are as likely to deform the truth as to
respect it.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Malcolm's subject in her new book is criminal justice, or,
more accurately, the way in which a trial is not a search for the
truth but a battleground for two competing narratives, the
prosecution's and the defense's. Like her previous works, ``The
Crime of Sheila McGough'' presents a fascinating case study, in
this instance the apparently unjust conviction of Ms. McGough, a
lawyer, for participating in the white-collar crimes of one of her
clients. But Ms. Malcolm's main theme is, as before, the vexing
power of the person who controls the words, who invents the
narrative and who thus prevails over the truth.
</P>
<P>
   But also as before, she makes far too much of her theory. In
some respects what she does in all three of these books is state in
catchy, seemingly incisive epigrammatic form what are actually
rather obvious problems in real-world investigations, most
obviously that the truth is difficult to determine and moreover
that there are unscrupulous or careless or lazy people out there
who manipulate and falsify.
</P>
<P>
   And so, on the one hand, Ms. Malcolm provides useful insights
into the reality that often lies behind appearances. On the other,
she inflates these particular insights into all-purpose conclusions
that wreak the same injustice on the complex and elusive truth as
the false narratives she exposes. An additional though related flaw
is discernable in her new book. While Ms. Malcolm makes a
persuasive case that Ms. McGough was indeed victimized by a false
narrative, some of the author's main conclusions are undermined by
the very evidence she presents.
</P>
<P>
   But first things first: Ms. Malcolm has performed a useful
public service in re-examining the case of Ms. McGough, a dedicated
but naive defense lawyer from Virginia. Ms. McGough, who spent two
and a half years in prison and was disbarred, was the defense
lawyer for a lifetime con artist named Bob Bailes, accused of
defrauding a bank by lying to get a loan. In the course of
defending him, Ms. McGough gave the appearance that she had crossed
the line from defense into illegal participation in Bailes' crimes,
for which she was indicted and convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Malcolm shows, by getting to know Ms. McGough well and by
carefully examining the evidence, that the conviction was probably
wrong. But she goes beyond this to a further belief. Ms. McGough
says she was so assiduous and unyielding in her defense of her
clients that she ended up irritating federal judges and prosecutors
and for that reason was prosecuted herself, on what she contends
were trumped-up charges. Ms. Malcolm agrees. ``It seems scarcely
possible that in this country someone could go to prison for merely
being irritating,'' she writes, ``but as far as I can make out,
this is indeed what happened to Sheila McGough.''
</P>
<P>
   That argument is so thoroughly contradicted by Ms. Malcolm's own
evidence that one wonders if she really believes it. Yet in a
tricky way, by advancing it, she seems to engage in the same sort
of narrative oversimplification that she claims is inevitable, even
as the rest of her reporting shows that it isn't inevitable at all.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that Ms. McGough was prosecuted for ``merely being
irritating'' is, as journalists often put it, a good story, one
invested with paradox, with Kafkaesque absurdity, with government
abuse of power. To her credit, Ms. Malcolm, whose view of Ms.
McGough is nuanced and complicated, provides plenty of information
about the case, so that the messy, shapeless, uninteresting truth
becomes known, even if it is a truth that subverts the author's
interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Malcolm does show that Ms. McGough brought suspicion on
herself by getting too close to her clients. But she was prosecuted
in large part because the main victim of Bailes' fraud waged a
vindictive campaign against her, urging prosecutors to go after
her. Ms. Malcolm acknowledges that the main prosecutor, whom she
interviewed for her book, genuinely believed Ms. McGough to be
guilty. Moreover, adding to her troubles, Ms. McGough declined to
testify on her own behalf; she said she was worried that under
cross-examination she would have to incriminate her client, even
though he had already been convicted and was in prison.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Ms. Malcolm's own scrupulous laying out of the
facts shows that it was a complicated and highly unusual chain of
circumstances that resulted in Ms. McGough's apparently unwarranted
fate. Her conviction does, as Ms. Malcolm contends, illustrate the
power that a strong narrative can gain over messy, incoherent
truth, but she does not show that there was anything inevitable
about Ms. McGough's fate, especially given her decision not to tell
her story to the jury. Beyond that, there is nothing persuasive
here to indicate that she went to jail because annoyed federal
officials had framed her.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even if Ms. Malcolm conceptualizes too much, she tells a
fascinating story, an odd and cautionary case history of the legal
system in heedless operation. Ms. Malcolm, in covering the ground
thoroughly, writes of how she, too, was irritated by Ms. McGough.
She also demonstrates that lawyers, unlike, say, scientists, are
interested in winning cases, not in objectively ascertaining the
truth. But then, as always, she goes too far. ``Historical
reconstruction in all cases gives rise to structures that are more
like ruins than proper buildings,'' she writes.
</P>
<P>
   In all cases? The skillful act of historical reconstruction that
Ms. Malcolm performs in this book is a paradoxical refutation of
her own simplifying and sensationalist theoretical position.

   NEW YORK _ On a perfect Sunday morning in the Catskills last
summer I treaded water at the start of a triathlon with a 1.2-mile
swim in the Hudson River. When the gun sounded I swam straight into
a rope attached to a buoy, and floundered helplessly as a school of
hyper swimmers clambered over my back. I fought free, swore under
and above the water and took off after the parade of splashing arms
stretching out before me. After my fractured, panicky start in the
Hudson, I regained my composure and thrashed my way to the shore,
arriving 50 minutes later and somewhere in the middle of the pack.
</P>
<P>
   I grew up swimming: it was a big part of my childhood, and I've
always thought I was quite comfortable in the water. In fact, I am
. . . in a pool. But with no lap lines to guide me or walls to hold
on to, in deep brackish water with living creatures, the aquatic
demons of my past resurfaced.
</P>
<P>
   I recalled that when I was 9 I had to be rescued from a fierce
undertow in Mexico. I flashed back to head-high waves on a
reservoir in North Dakota that scared me witless during a
three-month kayak trip down the Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Swimming is different from other sports because you do it in
water, and man can't breathe in water. Even people who are
exceedingly comfortable in the water eventually get humbled,
sometimes severely. Take my friend and paddling partner Al.
</P>
<P>
   Cruising alone in a catamaran off the coast of South Carolina
one summer day, Al, who was trying to sail alone from Florida to
New York, fell into the water and watched in horror as his sleek
craft raced away like a defiant horse. He was roughly six miles
from shore.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did you do?'' I asked incredulously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had an all-day swim,'' he said, slipping a salty sailor's
term between ``day'' and ``swim.''
</P>
<P>
   I can only imagine what that day felt like, since Al is not one
to elaborate on his psychic experiences. But over time I could
sense that his relationship with water had changed, just as mine
had, from the various traumas I'd experienced in this most familiar
yet foreign medium.
</P>
<P>
   Given my summer experience, when I decided to enter a triathlon
in Hawaii that involved a mile-long swim this winter, I thought a
little formal training might help and I signed up for Doug Stern's
six-session beginner's swim clinic at Columbia Prep School on West
93rd Street.
</P>
<P>
   Stern, a highly animated, 55-year-old retired high school
teacher with a little bathing suit and big muscles, began the first
class by asking us: ``Who are you? And why are you here?''
</P>
<P>
   We were 15 New Yorkers, with nearly as many body types and
motivations, in a pool just 20 yards long. There were injured
runners looking for a fitness alternative, aspiring triathletes
(one woman had just completed her first event using the
backstroke), as well as swimmers who lacked the skills to improve.
A man in his 50s, a runner with a bad knee, was afraid to put his
head underwater. An overweight woman (``a dumpling,'' in Stern's
parlance) wanted to get in shape without taxing her joints. An
actress who moonlighted as a belly dancer had not liked other forms
of exercise she had tried.
</P>
<P>
   Stern has been a swim coach for 36 years. Through the turmoil of
an angry adolescence, the breakup of his first marriage and the
death of his brother _ a standout backstroker who died of cancer at
43 _ swimming has been the one constant in his life; the pool is a
refuge where he goes to rejuvenate. ``Focusing on a series of
repetitive movements calms the mind,'' he said. ``It's one of the
ultimate mantras.''
</P>
<P>
   His teaching philosophy, which he presented with the fervor of a
late-night infomercial, focuses on paying attention to what one is
doing on a sensory level. ``Swimming is about feel,'' he said.
``You have to get out of your head and into your body. You need to
watch your hands enter the water, feel the water when you kick,
hold the glide. This is a very sensual experience. It's wild!''
</P>
<P>
   Going off into a discussion of body awareness, he mentioned a
student who claimed she was ``unable'' to bring her left arm
further forward during her stroke, that it ``just wanted'' to go
off to the side. In midsentence, Stern grabbed himself around the
neck. Gagging, his garbled words echoing off the tiled walls, he
engaged in an animated display of self-abuse. ``Talk to your
hands!'' he cried. After a valiant struggle, he let go and said,
``Don't do that again!'' and resumed his lecture with barely a
pause. We had just witnessed the danger of failing to communicate
with your hands.
</P>
<P>
   That first class was more about talk than action. In the next
week's session the swimming turned serious. Stern broke down the
components of the free-style stroke, demonstrating them on land and
in the water. ``Swimming is about flow lines,'' he said. In other
words, making your body ``long'' (reaching out to grab the water)
and rotating on your side reduces drag and increases glide. While
this may sound like Physics 101, the mechanics of the free-style
stroke can be explained in three minutes. Of course, integrating it
is another story.
</P>
<P>
   Everything we did for the next four weeks was intended to
solidify the stroke in our bodies and in our minds. No matter the
drill, Stern hustled along the deck of the pool shouting, pleading,
cajoling, a combination of Soupy Sales and Mister Rogers, with
volume. ``Use your hips when you kick!'' ``Point your toes!'' ``See
your hands enter the water!'' ``Let your hand hang limp!'' and so
forth. ``Swimming is about feel! Feel it, feel it, feel it!'' he'd
bark, like a New Age drill sergeant with a New York accent.

MILLS ADDS TONE OF DIVERSITY IN ARGUING THE CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Amplifies that Mills is the third black since Reconstruction to
speak from the Senate floor.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Don't call back while Cheryl's on.
</P>
<P>
   That was the word from an excited White House worker Wednesday
as Cheryl D. Mills, a White House deputy counsel and
behind-the-scenes power, emerged from the shadows to defend
President Clinton, arguing strenuously that he should not be
convicted in a case that began with alleged civil rights violations
in the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit.
</P>
<P>
   It was, by any measure, an unusual moment. Mills, 33, is only
the third black since Reconstruction to speak from the Senate floor
_ former senators Edward W. Brooke of Massachusetts and Carol
Moseley-Braun of Illinois were the others.
</P>
<P>
   But at the White House the nervous anticipation focused not on
the rarity Mills represented but on the authority Clinton aides
hoped she would bring to the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stand here before you today because President Bill Clinton
believed I could stand here for him,'' she told the senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about civil rights, because this president's
record on civil rights, on women's rights, on all of our rights, is
unimpeachable,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In a trial that so far has featured only white male lawyers
arguing before a Senate dominated by white men, Mills's appearance
was a jolt, so much that Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott stumbled
and called her ``Mr. Counsel'' before correcting himself and saying
``Ms. Counsel,'' when he introduced her.
</P>
<P>
   Mills, a Stanford Law School graduate and one of Clinton's
longest-serving lawyers, is a member of the impeachment trial's
defense team, a group that expanded Tuesday when former Senator
Dale Bumpers of Arkansas, a longtime Clinton friend, took a seat
with the other White House lawyers on the Senate floor. Bumpers did
not seek reelection last year.
</P>
<P>
   Bumpers, a lawyer and like Clinton, a former Arkansas governor,
is a gifted orator who enjoys friendly relations with both
Republican and Democratic senators. He is being tapped for his
institutional perspective and knowledge of the chamber's traditions
that could bolster Clinton's defense.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Holmes Norton, a lawyer and the nonvoting House delegate
for the District of Columbia, said, ``I'm not sure if a black
lawyer helps him before the Senate. I do know that a former member
helps him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a member of the club. She is not a member of the club, ''
Norton said.
</P>
<P>
   Mills was the third White House lawyer to argue on Clinton's
behalf, following on the heels of White House counsel Charles F. C.
Ruff and special counsel Gregory Craig. Craig focused on the first
article of impeachment, which alleges Clinton committed perjury
during his Aug. 17 grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Craig was foreign policy adviser from 1984 to 1988 for Senator
Edward M. Kennedy. In 1991, he prepped Kennedy for his testimony in
the Palm Beach, Fla., rape trial of the senator's nephew, William
Kennedy Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, David Kendall, Clinton's personal attorney and trusted
friend of Hillary Rodham Clinton, will discuss various aspects of
the obstruction of justice charge. Kendall has been Clinton's lead
lawyer on the Whitewater investigation. He saw his profile climb
during his cross-examination of Independent Counsel Kenneth W.
Starr last month during the House Judiciary Committee's impeachment
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Bumpers will summarize the case Thursday to end the White House
defense, rounding out three days of arguments that opened Tuesday
with an overview by Ruff, who called the charges against the
president ``a witches' brew'' of conjecture that did not warrant
the president's removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   Three other lawyers sitting at the defense table have not had
speaking roles. They are deputy White House counsel Bruce R.
Lindsey, the president's close confidant from Arkansas; Nicole K.
Seligman, Kendall's partner at the Williams &AMP; Connolly law firm;
and Lanny Breuer, a special White House counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Seligman, who attended Radcliffe College and Harvard Law School,
was a member of the defense team that represented Oliver L. North
in the Iran-Contra controversy. She also represented John F.
Kennedy Jr. and his sister, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, in their
efforts to stop the auctioning of their father's presidential
memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Mills' public debut of sorts Wednesday, on the sixth
anniversary of her appointment at the White House, that gave the
impeachment trial a different flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Mills's job before the Senate was to poke holes in the
Republican prosecutors' case by rebutting charges that Clinton
obstructed justice when his secretary, Betty Currie, retrieved
gifts from Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Mills argued that Currie had testified before the grand jury
that Clinton did not order her to get the gifts from Lewinsky.
Mills said it was an insult to Currie to suggest that her loyalty
to Clinton ``breeds dishonesty.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills opened her argument by saying, ``As a lawyer, as an
American, and as an African-American,'' the rule of law is a
strongly held principle of hers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is what many have struggled and died for, the right to be
equal before the law,'' she said, speaking deliberately, and using
the cadence of her voice for effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hate to take her on in a courtroom,'' said Minyon Moore,
the White House deputy political director who took a break from
working to watch Mills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's fair to say that the president has extraordinary
confidence in her,'' said White House spokesman Barry Toiv.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Mills is teasingly referred to as ``Dr.
No,'' for having a tendency during Clinton's reelection campaign in
1996 to veto certain expenditures to avoid possible ethics
violations.
</P>
<P>
   She joined Clinton's campaign in 1992, moving from the
Washington area to Little Rock, Ark., to serve as a deputy general
counsel during the Clinton-Gore campaign. She joined the White
House staff after the president's inauguration, rising from an
associate counsel to holding the dual title of deputy assistant and
deputy counsel to the president.
</P>
<P>
   A close associate of Mills at the White House, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said that Mills ``puts a face on the
president and his commitment to civil rights'' and that she offered
a potent counterpunch to Republican prosecutors who accused Clinton
last week of rolling back civil rights by his conduct in the Jones
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think about it, there is absolutely no way something
like this could have happened even 10 years ago . . . where an
African-American woman would be arguing on behalf of the president
really in any capacity, let alone in a capacity this momentous,''
Mills's colleague said.

NEW YORK: York accent.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Describing the myriad drills we did would be dull, even to those
who regularly don nose clips and ear plugs. But it is instructive
to note that during the ensuing weeks I was moving through the
water faster and more efficiently even though I wasn't swimming
between classes. On the train home to Brooklyn after each class I
felt calm and weary and a little high _ the post-swim ``ultimate
mantra'' buzz that makes the sport so addictive.
</P>
<P>
   Each week we added distance to improve our conditioning, and did
more drills to increase body awareness. For example, during the
third 90-minute session we did a thoroughly ridiculous, exhausting
exercise called ``chicken wings,'' which involved sticking our
thumbs under our armpits and flap-stroking across the pool. The
aim? To insure high elbow lift and recovery _ two key elements to a
faster free-style stroke. Afterward Stern gazed admiringly at his
hands and said: ``When you unfold your arms, you realize how great
these things really are!''
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of the final class was another time trial. Five
weeks earlier I'd done 19 laps in 10 minutes; this time I logged
24. After I finished my test, I sat next to Stern trying to catch
my breath while the rest of the class did battle with the clock.
</P>
<P>
   It was inspiring to watch. The backstroking triathlete swam face
down gracefully; the ``dumpling'' who had floundered now doggedly
powered across the pool. The man who couldn't put his face in the
water, who had barely been able to do one lap without coughing up
water, increased his total from 6 to 13 laps. The aimless belly
dancer swam with purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with better technique and a reassuring words of wisdom
from Stern, on Maui's south shore I waited anxiously with 299 other
hard bodies at the start of a triathlon called Xterra. In past
races, if I started slowly I was left in the wake. If I swam too
fast, I went to pieces, hyperventilating and resorting to a dog
paddle.
</P>
<P>
   Lining up on the outside to avoid the churning masses, I did
what I had been taught by Stern: bringing full body awareness to my
swimming. I concentrated on lifting my shoulders out of the water,
relaxing my hands at the elbow, stretching as far forward as I
could. I let my body roll and glide on its side, locked onto the
water with a bent wrist and pulled and then pushed the water toward
my thigh. Before you could say Johnny Weissmuller I found a rhythm,
felt at ease and was moving efficiently, even passing people. More
important, my poor swim performances in past triathlons made more
sense to me: subpar form and unconscious fear exacerbated by the
stress of competition.
</P>
<P>
   As I made my way from sea to land en route to the transition
area where my bike waited, I glanced up at the clock on the beach.
I'd covered the mile in 24:44, well behind the top dogs but faster
than I'd ever gone before. For the first time in a lifetime of
swimming, I felt like a real swimmer.

ARCHBISHOP'S FRIENDSHIP HELPS SPUR POPE'S TRIP TO ST. LOUIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By OSCAR AVILA  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ As a Vatican diplomat for almost 30 years, Justin
Rigali saw the fervor. People waited hours to glimpse the pope for
a few seconds. Some fainted. Others cried. Many thanked God.
</P>
<P>
   When Pope John Paul II traveled, Rigali was by his side. On
airplanes, they talked about their faith. They shared scores of
dinners, including birthday cake prepared by nuns at the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   When Rigali became archbishop of St. Louis in 1994, he wanted
his new flock to experience his friend's inspiration firsthand.
</P>
<P>
   Every time Rigali asked the pope to visit St. Louis, his friend
would just smile. ``We'll see,'' the pope would reply. ``We'll
see.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rigali followed the pope's example. He tried to be a
teacher. He tried to cling to his principles _ too stubbornly, some
critics say.
</P>
<P>
   And he finally achieved another goal. In April, the Vatican
announced the pope would visit St. Louis after a trip to Mexico
City.
</P>
<P>
   When the pope arrives in St. Louis on Tuesday, Rigali will be at
his side again. Up to 1 million people could turn out for the
visit, and Rigali can't wait to introduce his friend to his
spiritual family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Catholic community will experience the wonderful
experience of being together with the chief shepherd,'' Rigali said
in a recent interview. ``It will be a reinforcement of their faith
and the unity we all have as a universal church. It will be an
uplifting experience.''
</P>
<P>
   That effect is typical, but the circumstances surrounding this
visit aren't. The pope's trip is a pastoral visit, not tied to a
specific event, such as the 1993 visit to Denver for World Youth
Day.
</P>
<P>
   And he is only visiting one American city instead of several.
Also, the pope usually visits during warm weather, to accommodate
outdoor events.
</P>
<P>
   The special circumstances speak to the pope's friendship with
Rigali, which began with a chance meeting in a Vatican elevator.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues say that St. Louis is lucky the pope agreed to visit,
and that Rigali was willing to accept all the work involved with
the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of places would love to have this, but not everybody.
It's a lot of work and it can be very consuming,'' said Archbishop
Jerome Hanus of Dubuque, Iowa, who serves with Rigali on a national
liturgical committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Archbishop Rigali is a good person to head up that task. He's
a very talented, experienced person,'' said Hanus, who will
celebrate the Mass at the Trans World Dome. ``It's a big challenge,
but he's up to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rigali prefers to work behind the scenes. The California native
lived in Rome for three decades, starting as a student. He also
worked four years in Madagascar at the apostolic nunciature,
basically the Vatican's embassy.
</P>
<P>
   After returning to the Vatican, Rigali held several jobs,
including translating documents, teaching diplomats and directing
the diplomatic school. He later became secretary of the
Congregation of Bishops and of the College of Cardinals, the
Vatican's decisionmaking body.
</P>
<P>
   He also helped plan several of the pope's overseas trips.
</P>
<P>
   His new job has created its share of controversies and placed
Rigali in an uncomfortable spot _ under public scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned that poor residents would not have access to health
care, Rigali opposed the sale of St. Louis University Hospital to a
for-profit corporation. That placed Rigali at odds with the Jesuit
institution's president.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Rigali resisted efforts by teachers in the archdiocese's
schools to form a union. He wouldn't even meet with the teachers'
group for weeks, prompting one to compare herself to Dorothy trying
to see the Wizard.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, Rigali didn't budge. The Vatican approved the
hospital sale but only after the contract included guarantees of
charitable care. The teachers got a voice in negotiating but no
collective bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rigali tries to maintain his privacy.
</P>
<P>
   He is reluctant to be photographed by the media. In an interview
before becoming archbishop, he advised a St. Louis reporter not to
ask personal questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to talk about what kinds of books I read, and
things like that,'' he told the reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Rigali praised the pope for being oblivious to his critics. And
he is in awe of how his friend functions under the global
microscope.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole world has seen so many pictures of him. They've seen
him with old people, with children, with the sick,'' Rigali said.
``There's not much privacy in his life. It's a different life.''
</P>
<P>
   Rigali respects the pope's unwavering beliefs, including his
opposition to abortion and birth control. Some have criticized the
pope's views on birth control, especially in the age of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   In his own secular debates, Rigali has tried to follow the
pope's example. He hasn't budged easily after staking out a
position. And Rigali praises the pope for making his spiritual
views relevant to the economic, political and social concerns of
the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sets such a shining example. Being next to the pope has
been a challenge to me,'' Rigali said. ``To rise to his level is
something that would take a long, long time.''
</P>
<P>
   For a couple of days, the world's spotlight will be on St. Louis
and on the pope. And just like old times, Rigali will be by his
side.

REMINDERS OF THE PAST ARE STACKING UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) A man I know lived in more than 20 houses during his
working life, and since retiring he has lived in two, or possibly
three, others.
</P>
<P>
   That man has owned more houses than I've owned pairs of shoes,
and changes them with greater casualness.
</P>
<P>
   My wife and I (ital)march to a different drum,(end ital) as they
say _ a cliche both stale and inexact, for we have ``marched''
nowhere. We have remained in place.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years we've toyed with the idea of going to live
somewhere outside the city. Someplace with a barn, where we could
expand our holdings of cats and dogs, to something a bit nearer a
thousand.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time, before the house filled up, when we might
actually have done that, but now the prospect of moving anywhere is
too awful even to consider.
</P>
<P>
   We are savers, both of us. And it's a curse.
</P>
<P>
   Every drawer is full. My closet holds garments unworn for
decades, made to fit a creature whose shape no longer bears any
resemblance to my own.
</P>
<P>
   There's a room to which we refer, preposterously, as the
``upstairs office.'' Actually, I believe it originally was a
sleeping porch, though I did work up there briefly.
</P>
<P>
   The room is unheated, and in winter I had to use an electric
space heater to keep my fingers from freezing to the typewriter
keys. So after only a year or two I gave it up and moved to a
heated quarter of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Now that room is a kind of document depository and museum, whose
contents are a fabulous mix.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen or more large boxes contain 30-some years of bank
statements and canceled checks, and the same number of years of
income tax returns, with all the supporting documents and receipts.
Because who knows when the auditor might come, or how deep into my
past he might go poking after deceit?
</P>
<P>
   Then there's all the writing I've done since 1955, and some from
before then. In more than 40 years almost anyone can put down
several million words without trying. And that much prose,
regardless of merit, takes up a lot of room.
</P>
<P>
   I think that's why people who live in cramped apartments tend to
be poets instead. Verse occupies less space.
</P>
<P>
   What else? There's a three-drawer file cabinet and a row of
lawyer's bookcases containing earlier versions of published stuff,
and the notes from which the pieces were written, and photographs
taken to illustrate them.
</P>
<P>
   There's correspondence from readers over the last 20 years,
carefully boxed and bagged _ saved for no reason I can imagine,
unless, in some confrontation with my masters, it's to fling down
that heap of ancient mail and cry out, (ital)See there! See
there!(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   Finally there are 23 typewriters, some of them wonderful
antiques, each with a document testifying to its provenance.
</P>
<P>
   Insane, isn't it? And I speak only of my own ungoverned savings,
leaving my wife to answer for her own.
</P>
<P>
   That room is directly above the heated one where I now work. The
other day I heard her up there, dragging heavy objects from one
place to another. She has been seized by the idea of
(ital)verticality.(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   Until now, she explained over lunch, things have been in
waist-high piles, all but filling the floor and making passage in
that room practically impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Her new plan, as I get it, is to stack everything _ boxes,
crates, bags, everything _ around the walls, floor to ceiling. That
will free up an area in the middle for movement, although as I see
it the danger of someone getting brained by a 1932 Underwood
standard typewriter seems very real.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, that's where we stand at this point in our lives.
</P>
<P>
   We've no hope of moving anywhere. We're just moving things
(ital)around.(end ital)

   POPE-FRIEND (St. Louis) _ Archbishop Justin Rigali has been
asking his friend Pope John Paul II to come to St. Louis for years.

`SIX-STRING SAMURAI': FROM A NEW DIRECTOR, A HIGHLIGHTS REEL
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes at end of review) 
(DW) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In his debut film, ``Six-String Samurai,'' Lance
Mungia doesn't have anything to say except that he has done his
homework. He says that stylishly in a shoestring movie that amounts
to a kaleidoscopic calling card intended to show prospective
employers that he can handle a variety of genres.
</P>
<P>
   As its title suggests, ``Six-String Samurai,'' written by Mungia
and Jeffrey Falcon, its star, draws from Japan's samurai films as
well as cinematic tales built around rock musicians.
</P>
<P>
   So besides ``The Buddy Holly Story'' and, say, ``Yojimbo,''
Mungia's film is littered with elements of post-apocalyptic road
movies, buddy adventures, odd-couple comedies, spaghetti westerns,
Death in the style of Ingmar Bergman, ``Star Wars,'' ``Lawrence of
Arabia,'' low-budget 1950s Cold War sci-fi chillers, war films and,
of course, the ineluctable ``Wizard of Oz,'' all to the
accompaniment of a sprightly rock score by the Red Elvises, a group
of Russian-born musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six-String Samurai,'' which Mungia says traces its origins to
his effort to create an undergraduate thesis film, tells the story
of Buddy ( Falcon) and the Kid (Justin McGuire). Set in 1957, after
an atomic war has devastated the United States and led to Russian
occupation, it puts Buddy on the road to Lost Vegas, the last
bastion of freedom, where a successor to Elvis, the dead King, is
to be chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy, packing a guitar and a samurai sword, and dressed in a
tattered dark suit and accessorized with the heavy black-framed
eyeglasses that recall Buddy Holly, is bound for Lost Vegas along a
road filled with lethal and musical rivals when he encounters and
saves the Kid from the bad guys who have just killed his mother.
</P>
<P>
   The laconic Buddy would like the Kid to get lost, but no such
luck. Soon they are headed for Lost Vegas, through assorted
villains and perils, including Death and his henchmen.
</P>
<P>
   Filmed mostly in Death Valley, with Kristian Bernier as
cinematographer, ``Six-String Samurai'' depicts its harsh landscape
with a sharp, clear eye and recounts its silly, derivative tale
with tongue firmly in cheek.
</P>
<P>
   But it remains an apprentice work that leaves the hope that
Mungia's scholarship, perseverance and technical skills will
someday be applied to more original material. &QL;
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    REPUBLICANS OFFER TO RESERVE SURPLUS FOR SOCIAL SECURITY
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans signaled a willingness Thursday
to set aside 62 percent of the projected federal surplus until
Social Security's fiscal problems are solved, but would not commit
to President Clinton's plan to use the money specifically for the
nation's retirement and disability program.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, in turn, signaled they would be willing to talk about
an income tax cut sought by Republicans, but not until the fiscal
problems facing Social Security and Medicare are resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The party lines were drawn at a House Ways and Means Committee
hearing that featured former Republican vice presidential nominee
Jack Kemp and the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP proposal was offered by Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas,
chairman of the committee, which has jurisdiction in the House over
Social Security and tax matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe I can speak for the Republican majority in saying
that we will accept the president's offer and commit to reserve 62
percent of the surplus until Social Security has been saved, and
work together within that framework,'' Archer said.
</P>
<P>
   But when Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, the ranking Democrat
on the committee, later thanked the chairman for his offer, Archer
made it clear he was not committing to using the money for Social
Security, only that he would not use it until Social Security was
reformed.
</P>
<P>
   Rangel urged the committee to find common ground for agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's talk about what we agree on. ...Let's say we saved
Social Security, we saved Medicare and then let's talk about a tax
cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Committee spokesman Ari Fleischer later said Archer's statement
was intended to ``reach out to the president,'' and accept the
White House commitment to using the surplus to save Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Archer is will to dedicate every penny of that (62
percent) to Social Security and is willing to hold the entire
amount in reserve'' until an agreement is reached with the White
House on how to save Social Security, Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, if an agreement were reached on other savings for
the program, more of the surplus would be available for other
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth S. Apfel, commissioner of the Social Security
Administration, said Thursday he supports Clinton's plan to use 62
percent of the surplus to extend the life of the Social Security
trust fund from 2032 until 2055.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that plan calls for investing about a fourth of the
money set aside for Social Security _ about $700 billion over 17
years _ in private markets. While Clinton has said he wants to
devise a bipartisan method to shield such investments from
governmental interference, the issue was a focal point of
Thursday's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Archer and other Republicans _ backed by Kemp _ criticized the
proposal, but Rangel said Democrats would be willing to put it
aside for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Kemp urged the committee to save Social Security by cutting
taxes to bolster the economy and by letting people create
individual investment accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson rejected private accounts as a substitute for Social
Security's guaranteed benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every program to privatize or partially privatize Social
Security by definition turns the program away from supporting
families and towards individual risk,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr., R-Fla., chairman of the panel's Social
Security subcommittee, said he would ask for an analysis of all of
the reform proposals that have been offered. But Shaw said two
options did not appear likely: raising payroll tax rates or cutting
benefits to current recipients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is going to steal from our grandmothers and
grandfathers. ...We have a covenant with them,'' Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said he favored private investments with constraints so
people ``are not investing in the Lotto or with their
brother-in-law in some cockamamie stock.''

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT GEARS UP TO SUE TOBACCO COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following President Clinton's promise that the
federal government would sue the tobacco industry, Attorney General
Janet Reno said Thursday that the Justice Department was starting
work on the lawsuit seeking reimbursement for billions of dollars
spent by government health programs to treat smoking-related
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're putting together the task force, and they will make the
recommendation as to when and where to file the lawsuit,'' Reno
told a news conference. A Justice Department official said the team
would have about 25 members drawn from various divisions within the
agency.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit would seek to recover billions spent to treat
smoking-related illnesses through Medicare and other federal
insurance programs for military personnel and government employees.
One Justice Department official estimated that more than $10
billion is spent each year by Medicare to treat smoking-related
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Reno would not speculate on when the lawsuit would be filed,
saying only that the department would proceed with ``all deliberate
speed.'' Other Justice Department officials speaking on condition
of anonymity said it could be months before the suit was filed.
</P>
<P>
   Reno dismissed tobacco industry contentions that the Justice
Department may not have the right to sue the cigarette companies.
``I have made the decision, after going through the legal issues
that are involved, that we can file a lawsuit,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials point to a landmark 1947 U.S. Supreme Court
decision that limits the ability of the federal government to
recover from any individuals or companies unless there was explicit
statutory authority for such a claim.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Justice Department lawyers had been leery about the
prospects of taking on tobacco producers.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department sources said the task force was considering
several legal strategies to use against the tobacco industry,
including charging the companies with fraud or negligence.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry agreed last year to settle more than three
dozen state lawsuits seeking reimbursement for expenditures by
state-funded medical programs for the treatment of tobacco-linked
illnesses. The settlement cost the cigarette makers more than $240
billion.
</P>
<P>
   That settlement money, meanwhile, has become the subject of a
bitter dispute between the Clinton administration and the states.
</P>
<P>
   The administration claims it is entitled to part of settlements
the states reach with tobacco companies because the states
recovered Medicaid money spent on smoking-related illnesses. The
federal government pays the states for at least half of Medicaid in
every state.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a bipartisan group of senators promised legislation
to block any federal effort to grab a share of the settlement
money.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government's claim to part of the settlement is
``absolutely wrong and we're going to fight it every step of the
way,'' said Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, who joined Sens.
Bob Graham, D-Fla., Slade Gorton, R-Wash., Evan Bayh, D-Ind., and
George Voinovich, R-Ohio, in voicing their support for the states.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Gregoire, Washington state attorney general, said the
states would sue the federal government ``the first time a penny is
deducted'' from the settlement money.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government was not involved in the settlement last
fall in which states won $206 billion, Graham said. ``It would be
unseemly now at the end of the process for the federal government
to try to recoup'' some of the money.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have said they are willing to negotiate
the dispute, suggesting that the states might be able to keep all
the money if they promise to spend it on public health.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials said Thursday that the planned
federal lawsuit against the tobacco industry would not seek any of
the money collected by the states through their settlement with the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This lawsuit won't have anything to do with any federal effort
to recoup money from the states,'' a Justice Department official
said.

`A VICTORIAN SALON': A WORLD OF KITSCH IN ITS VICTORIAN GLORY 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By GRACE GLUECK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bournemouth, the coastal resort in southern England,
may not be a world cultural capital but don't dismiss it. It is the
home of the Russell-Cotes Art Gallery and Museum, among other
attractions. This stronghold of conservative British Victorian
painting gives the word kitsch a new dimension.
</P>
<P>
   Established by a hotel proprietor, Sir Merton Russell-Cotes
(1835-1922), and his heiress wife, Annie (1835-1921), the
collection is still displayed in the far-out (but since expanded)
French-Italian pile overlooking the bay where the couple lived from
1907 until their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   A current refurbishing program has brought some 35 paintings
from the collection to the Dahesh Museum here through April 17, by
now established as a kind of New York hospitality center for the
19th-century arriere-garde. While the resulting show, ``A Victorian
Salon: Paintings From the Russell-Cotes Art Gallery and Museum,''
is generally awash in the high-camp flummery of a 19th-century
Royal Academy exhibition, it is not without some redeeming esthetic
values.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Merton was one of the more active collectors of his day,
doting on big-name British artists, mainly members of the fusty
Royal Academy whose imprimatur he sought. Like many current
collectors of contemporary art in the United States, he also liked
to hang out with artists he admired, visiting their studios and
often palatial homes. British art, he felt, was as good as that
produced by foreigners, and deserved his patriotic support. (So
much for the European avant-garde of his era.) He enjoyed a robust
confidence in his own opinions.
</P>
<P>
   His favorite painter was Edwin Longsden Long (1829-91), a
versatile and hugely successful exploiter of Spanish history and
genre, portrait, Egyptian, classical and biblical subjects. At his
peak Long's gargantuan works sold for thousands of pounds; at his
death he went out of fashion, and his prices plunged precipitously.
Today an effort is being made, with publication of a recent
monograph by Mark Bills of the Russell-Cotes gallery, to rescue
Long from his well-earned obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Merton owned no less than 16 oils by Long. Three of them are
in the show, and they reveal him to be, like many of the artists
here, a polished technician of marketable banalities. His ``Alethe,
Attendant of the Sacred Ibis'' (1888), based on a poem and novel by
Thomas Moore, depicts Alethe, a secret Christian who served as a
priestess of the Egyptian goddess Isis, before her discovery and
martyrdom.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by ibises and not looking happy, she has the slim
figure of a Victorian maiden and a costume more English than
Egyptian. If she was a little too decorative to be a Christian
martyr, even a suppressed one, who knew? Certainly not Long's
upscale patrons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alethe'' is among the many wonderfully sappy, coyly erotic,
religious, historical and mythological tableaux that populate the
show, from Thomas Matthews Rooke's ``King Ahab's Coveting'' (1879),
an ambitious six-painting suite contained in a walloping six-pack
gilt frame, to Edward Matthew Hale's ``Psyche at the Throne of
Venus'' (1883), whose jealous Venus, breasts bared, smirks on a
lavish throne as the semi-nude Psyche grovels before her. Ethnic
and genre studies (the British idea of ethnic subjects in those
days were largely sexy young Italian women); humanized animals,
like the pug puppy fascinated by a noisy watch in Briton Riviere's
``Tick-Tick'' (1881); crowded history paintings, portraits and
landscapes also line the walls, buttressing the word ``salon'' in
the show's title.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the artists' names have faded from memory. Sir Edwin
Henry Landseer (1802-73), the animal painter adored by Queen
Victoria, is represented by a bustling, compositionally challenged
canvas, ``Flood in the Highlands'' (1864), depicting a huddle of
humans and beasts threatened by rising waters. Dante Gabriel
Rossetti (1828-82) is at a peak of pre-Raphaelite insipidity in
``Venus Verticordia'' (1864-68), a heavily symbolic portrait of
Venus in a bower of lush flowers holding a golden apple and a
Cupid's dart. And there is the obligatory work by Frederic Lord
Leighton (1830-96): a study for his ``Perseus and Andromeda''
(1891). The murky canvas depicts Andromeda in the clutches of a sea
monster sent by Poseidon to destroy her, while in the sky above,
her rescuer, Perseus, riding the winged horse Pegaus, shoots arrows
at the unseemly beast.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the redeeming treasures in the show were done by
nonmembers of the Royal Academy. Among them are the small ``Drawing
Room, 1 A Holland Park'' (1887), by Anna Alma Tadema (1865-1943),
daughter of Sir Lawrence Alma Tadema, which impresses with its
quiet, deft handling of a riotously patterned interior. The undated
``Landscape With Poultry,'' by William Baptiste Baird (born in 1847
and date of death unknown), showing chickens in a field before a
farmhouse all but concealed by trees, is a fine unpretentious
example of French-style, pre-Impressionist plein-air painting.
</P>
<P>
   The lyrical ``An Autumn Idyll'' (1885), by John Atkinson
Grimshaw (1836-93), is a moody scene, probably in Chelsea, that
seems to evoke the atmosphere of Henry James.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it's more in line with the silly Victorian
pomposities of the show, ``Midsummer'' (1887), by Albert Joseph
Moore (1841-93), a leading figure of the art-for-art's sake
Esthetic Movement, showing two maidens with fans attending a third,
is a knockout with its ``modern'' flat patterning and its brilliant
orchestration of a deep salmon color for the gowns and decor.
</P>
<P>
   A stroll through this Victorian theme park will do no harm. You
may regret that the technical skills of most of these artists were
not better employed, but the show may make you even more grateful
that good art drives out the bad.

RICARDO MUTI AND THE N.Y. PHILHARMONIC: CONNECTIONS WELL MADE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Riccardo Muti has conducted so often in New York that
it was simply a matter of time before he got around to doing it
with the New York Philharmonic. Wednesday night's subscription
program at Avery Fisher Hall, to be repeated Friday night and
Saturday, reaffirms qualities already apparent from Muti's recent
visits with the Vienna Philharmonic and his long years as head of
the Philadelphia Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Muti is a sound musician who knows precisely how to make
orchestras do what he wants them to do. His programs are unusual
and thoughtful without being particularly daring, and when he has a
chance to make connections with his own Italian culture, he does.
He did so with four excerpts from Busoni's ``Turandot'' Suite.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounding Busoni's curious brand of show business stood the
long and amiable D Major Serenade of Brahms, music that argues
charmingly against that composer's reputation for austerity, and
then Ravel's ``Bolero.'' Here &UR; , &LR;  as in the past, Muti was neither a
seeker of hidden profundities nor a shallow exploiter of the
moment. He takes the music before him at face value and does the
best he can with it.
</P>
<P>
   This is considerable. His tempos work, and they are honestly
sustained. The refusal to hurry gave Brahms' triplets in the
opening Allegro molto a lovely languid charm. No climax existed
merely to excite, but each was the result of a process: a logical,
indeed necessary, summoning of musical details. I have heard more
personal and engaged performances of the Serenade, but the
Philharmonic's first-rate wind and brass soloists played very well.
</P>
<P>
   They had an even better time in ``Bolero,'' a piece designed for
the delight of ambitious orchestra players and the even greater
delight of audiences. Here Ravel played a game with his own skills:
how to write a quarter-hour of the same music in the same key and
keep it interesting solely by means of orchestration and dynamics.
It is a remarkable tour de force, and Muti understands that while
``Bolero'' almost always succeeds, it flourishes only under careful
management.
</P>
<P>
   The attention to Ravel's unbending dance rhythm was fierce and
faithful; crescendos and escalations of instrumental combinations
were scrupulously organized. Like all good conductors, Muti knew
when to let his players alone and when to keep their strict
attention.
</P>
<P>
   It has always been a puzzlement how Busoni remains (rightly)
revered as a visionary teacher, performer and musical thinker and
yet seems to have written so much music either of absurd complexity
or almost cheesy frivolity. The ``Turandot'' suite is an eight-part
descriptive musical companion to the Carlo Gozzi tale made more
famous by Puccini. Muti's chosen excerpts bounce and slink with
rhythmic and melodic orientalisms. They are often obvious, always
entertaining and occasionally darkened by sinister turns of
harmony.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, thunderstorms replete with golf-ball-sized hail
pelted portions of Missouri as an area of exceptionally warm and
humid air was lifted north from the Gulf of Mexico. On Friday, the
sultry air will fuel a line of very strong thunderstorms that will
march east across the lower Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys. As a
potent jet stream disturbance passes overhead, some of these storms
will turn severe. Torrential rain, damaging winds, hail and
isolated tornadoes are possible.
</P>
<P>
   Showers and isolated weaker thunderstorms will develop from the
Ohio Valley to the southern Great Lakes as low pressure strengthens
over Missouri. A narrow stripe of heavy snow with some ice along
its southern flank will fall from central Kansas to southern
Minnesota as colder air is drawn southward into the low's
circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Warmer air will be drawn northward into the Eastern states
Friday. Indeed, aided by a few glimpses of sunshine, afternoon
temperatures will average more than 10 degrees above normal from
Georgia to Virginia. Cold, dense air, enhanced by an extensive snow
cover, will keep conditions chillier across the Northeast where
intermittent ice will affect upstate New York and western New
England.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, a steady stream of Pacific moisture will promote
heavy rain in much of northern California and along the Northwest
Coast. As the moist air is lifted and cooled by the interior
mountains, heavy snow will blanket much of the Sierra and Cascade
Ranges. Elsewhere, dry and warm air will cover the Southwestern
States.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: The Thaw
</P>
<P>
   The mild air that will reach its peak in the next few days over
the East is the famous January thaw arriving on schedule. Records
during the last century show that average temperatures from January
21 to 26 increase by a degree or two in much of the Eastern United
States before falling to the lowest values in early February. While
the thaw doesn't happen every year, it occurs often enough to be a
real climatological phenomenon. Despite the increasing
understanding of the forces that drive the global climate, the
reason for the January thaw remains a meteorological mystery.

QUAYLE (Phoenix) - When Dan Quayle looks at the 2000 White House
race, he sees a new start for a promising political career that hit
a huge pothole in the vice president's office. Among conservatives,
he is considered a serious opponent to more moderate Republicans
like Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Arizona Sen. John McCain. Yet
when it comes to mainstream voters, it remains to be seen whether
Quayle can shake his image as a political unguided missile. By
MICHAEL MURPHY. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL;

KEVIN BACON-MUSIC (Phoenx) - Ham hocks, sausage, chorizo,
tenderloins, spareribs and pig's feet are six degrees of pork that
actor Kevin Bacon doesn't care to acknowledge. ``My name is a
curse,'' says the 40-year-old actor, calling from his New York
apartment. Despite the pig connection, Bacon doesn't have much to
squeal about these days. He has appeared in more Hollywood movies
than anyone cares to list, shares a happy family with wife Kyra
Sedgwick and is the focus of the campy cult-classic game Six
Degrees of Kevin Bacon. But a lesser-known venture has caused fans

<P>
   HOUSTON _ As the No. 3 executive at Neiman Marcus, Janet
Gurwitch Bristow seemed poised to land a top job at one of the
nation's powerful retail chains.
</P>
<P>
   As executive vice president of women's merchandise, she was
responsible for an area with more than $1 billion in annual
revenues. She commanded front row seats at the big fashion shows,
where Armani and Chanel trotted out their newest fashions for the
merchants who determined their fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is a very energetic, bright, enthusiastic merchant who
understands this business,'' said Neiman Marcus Chairman Burt
Tansky. ``She understands what women need and want.''
</P>
<P>
   When Business Week surveyed the landscape for ``The Future
Bosses of America,'' it tabbed Gurwitch Bristow as being among the
``Top 50 Hot Prospects.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going to be on everybody's call list,'' one
headhunter said of the group, which included executives at
Coca-Cola, Merrill Lynch and General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   With that going for her, her friends were shocked when Gurwitch
Bristow resigned from Neiman Marcus and started her own company in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Janet is the least likely person I know to become an
entrepreneur,'' said Linda Knight Quick, a senior vice president at
Foley's and a longtime friend. ``She makes a plan and lives by that
plan. She is not a jump-off-the-deep-end-type girl. When I saw her
taking this big risk, I was shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Gurwitch Bristow understood their confusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never had an entrepreneurial idea before,'' she
confesses. ``Starting this company was a gut-wrenching experience
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only was she launching a new company, but she was doing so
in a business that's notoriously inhospitable _ the cosmetics
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to come up with new, unique products in the
cosmetics business, because it is such a well-researched,
well-financed industry. It is not an easy place for a start-up,''
said Linda Wells, editor in chief at the fashion magazine Allure.
``It is an industry dominated by giants.''
</P>
<P>
   Gurwitch Bristow was willing to do battle with the giants
because she had noticed a trend that was beginning to reshape the
cosmetics business. More and more upscale customers were defecting
from the big cosmetics houses like Estee Lauder and spending their
money on select brands.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by and carrying the identity of big-name makeup artists
like Bobbi Brown, these lines offered an alternative to me-too
makeup buying. These new players offered makeup lines that are more
subtle and more in keeping with emerging fashion trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The upscale customer was moving toward more neutral
palettes,'' Gurwitch Bristow said. ``I thought we were about to see
an industry undergo a revolution. If you walk the floor of most
cosmetics departments today, you can't tell if it's 1965 or 1995.''
</P>
<P>
   Gurwitch Bristow left Neiman Marcus in early 1995, but her
company did not start shipping products until March 1996.
</P>
<P>
   During that first year, she moved from Dallas and established
her base of operations in Houston. She had come to know and like
the city during a 19-year stint working for Foley's. She also
wanted to be here for personal reasons, which included her marriage
to local lawyer Daryl Bristow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was desperate to be in Houston,'' she said. ``That's another
reason I started this company. I could choose to live where I
wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   To help finance her venture, Gurwitch Bristow formed a
partnership with Gary Kusin, a Dallas entrepreneur. In addition to
helping bankroll the new company, the former head of the Babbage's
software chain helped the company set up its distribution center
and computer system.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most critical move _ the decision that was key to
the company's ultimate success _ was finding the right makeup
artist to build Gurwitch Bristow Cosmetics around. Her choice was
Laura Mercier, whose list of celebrity clients includes Madonna and
Celine Dion.
</P>
<P>
   While not a household name, Mercier undoubtedly is a star in the
makeup world. Other business people had approached Mercier about
her own line of cosmetics before, but she had rebuffed them all.
But she said things were different with Gurwitch Bristow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the feeling she would respect my wishes,'' Mercier said.
``I don't think a lot of business people would have been willing to
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   More specifically, Mercier wanted to develop a top-shelf line of
cosmetics. She would brook no compromises on quality, even if costs
ran higher than expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to keep my integrity,'' Mercier said. ``That is very
important to me. We had to have the best ingredients, the best
formulas possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Gurwitch Bristow readily agreed to give Mercier control of the
products. The role of the Houston headquarters would be to handle
such issues as packaging, marketing and dealing with retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Mercier said the fact that Gurwitch Bristow and she are both
women gave her confidence to start their business venture together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a business person. I am an artist. I follow my
intuition,'' Mercier said. ``Janet has an honesty about her I could
trust. It is not often you find honest people in business, to tell
you the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Using the contacts she developed during her career with Foley's
and Neiman Marcus, Gurwitch Bristow was able to get her products
placed in 55 stores nationwide. They included some of the top names
in the retail business _ the Neiman Marcus chain, Macy's stores on
the West Coast, and Henri Bendel in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   She also used her contacts to get noticed by some of the
nation's most influential fashion publications.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she was at Neiman Marcus, Janet was one of the few
retailers who called fashion editors to ask for their advice and
opinions,'' Allure's Wells said. ``It is very unusual. You wouldn't
think it would be, but it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Armed with her connections and Mercier's reputation, the little
company was able to garner $6 million in sales during its first
year of selling products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Laura Mercier line has established a very strong niche,''
Wells said. ``She's always been known as a makeup artist who could
make skin look good without being heavily made up. She has products
that are unique, that hit on universal concerns for women.''
</P>
<P>
   An example is something called Secret Camouflage, a
light-looking makeup that conceals under-eye circles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very effective, unlike other products in the market,''
Wells said. ``Women are obsessed with their under-eye circles.''
</P>
<P>
   While the products have been received enthusiastically by
consumers, the company has hit some potholes on the highway to
success. The early packaging was too traditional and too
run-of-the-mill for such high-end products. The cost of revamping
the packaging forced the company to look for a new investor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raising money for a cosmetics company in an oil town was not
easy,'' Gurwitch Bristow said.
</P>
<P>
   The company was able to solve both problems. It revamped its
packaging and it found a financial partner in the Neiman Marcus
Group, the parent company that owns the chain of retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   Neiman Marcus Group spent $10 million to buy half of Gurwitch
Bristow Cosmetics this past November and give it the cash infusion
it needed. Neiman Marcus is a financial partner only and has not
assumed any management role.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is doing very, very well. It has high potential for
exciting growth for the future,'' Tansky said of the cosmetics
venture. ``We are very pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Mercier cosmetics are now sold in 100 stores in the United
States and Canada. Revenues hit $10 million last year and are
climbing rapidly. For instance, the company reaped sales of $7,700
during the week of Jan. 16, 1998. During the same week this year,
sales hit $20,700. The reason is the number of repeat customers,
Gurwitch Bristow said as she reviewed the weekly sales tally.
</P>
<P>
   The cosmetics are about to be introduced in Harrod's, the tony
London emporium.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will be a big deal for us. So many people from other
countries shop there, it will expose our company to people from all
over the world,'' Gurwitch Bristow said.
</P>
<P>
   The company also hopes to start selling its products on the
Internet by this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Projected revenues for 1999 are about $17 million. Better still,
Gurwitch Bristow Cosmetics is now in the black, a full year earlier
than original projections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starting this company was a big, competitive, scary thing,''
Mercier said. ``But our success has been magical, fantastic. I
still want to be very involved in this company, even if it becomes
big. This company is our baby. We have enormous pride in it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Starting a cosmetics company is cash-intensive, with a steep
cost curve to climb in the beginning. But once the original
infrastructure is in place, profits can pile up quickly because the
raw materials needed to make cosmetics are relatively inexpensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe there will be a new set of names to dominate this
industry in the next century,'' Gurwitch Bristow said. ``We believe
Laura Mercier will be one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   With survival and success come various types of recognition. One
was a recent invitation to join a local small business association.
Thanks, but no thanks, Gurwitch Bristow answered without
hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a young business; we are not a small business,'' she
said. ``I will either be a big business, or I will be out of
business. You can't do this and be a small company.''

   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in
New York City. Ratings and running times are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   Now Playing
</P>
<P>
   ``AFFLICTION,'' starring Nick Nolte, James Coburn, Willem Dafoe,
Sissy Spacek and Mary Beth Hurt. Directed by Paul Schrader (R, 114
minutes). Nolte is devastating in the performance of his career, as
Wade Whitehouse, a New Hampshire loner fighting a losing battle
with demons from his past. Foremost among them: Coburn,
terrifyingly authentic as the drunken, abusive father who long ago
cowed his sons into submission. As directed by Schrader, this pure,
unfettered adaptation of Russell Banks' novel starts on a
deceptively ordinary note, then escalates into inexorable fury.
Every little detail matters. Ms. Spacek and Ms. Hurt expertly play
the women who trigger Wade's crisis (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``AT FIRST SIGHT,'' starring Val Kilmer and Mira Sorvino.
Directed by Irwin Winkler (PG-13, 128 minutes). In this overlong
and often desperately banal version of a case study reported by Dr.
Oliver Sacks, Kilmer plays a man whose nearly lifelong blindness
was suddenly alleviated by surgery. Ms. Sorvino plays the
bright-eyed New York career woman who falls in love with him, then
urges him to change his once-peaceful life. But the film brings
little more than case-study data to communicating how this man's
restored sight affected him, or what made it a mixed blessing.
Sample dialogue: ``Have you ever listened to the rain? I mean,
really listened?'' (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``CENTRAL STATION,'' starring Fernanda Montenegro, Vinicius de
Oliveira and Marilia Pera. Directed by Walter Salles (R, 115
minutes). In this quiet, luminous Brazilian gem, a joyless older
woman crosses paths with an orphaned boy. There's plenty of room
for sentimentality here, but the wonder of Salles' film is all in
the telling. As these characters develop a fractious bond, then
embark on a road trip that takes them vividly to Brazil's
hinterlands in search of the boy's father, Salles brings great
tenderness and surprise to the events that punctuate their journey.
Ms. Montenegro's tough bravura performance was one of last year's
very best (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``A CIVIL ACTION,'' starring John Travolta and Robert Duvall.
Directed by Steven Zaillian (PG-13, 120 minutes). This story of a
David-Goliath lawsuit against industrial polluters, with Travolta
first-rate as an ambulance chaser who develops a conscience, could
have been business as usual in the legal thriller genre. But
Zaillian's keenly observed, beautifully acted film, based on
Jonathan Harr's nonfiction best seller about a case in Woburn,
Mass., doesn't follow familiar formulas. It follows all the
surprises and frustrations of a story that was never black and
white, and is all the better for its shades of gray. Duvall is
outstanding as a corporate lawyer full of wily tricks (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``DR. AKAGI,'' starring Akira Emoto. Directed by Shohei Imamura
(not rated, 128 minutes). This bawdy gallows comedy centering on
the treatment of hepatitis is an eclectic footnote to the career of
a Japanese filmmaker known for quirky daring (as in, most recently,
``The Eel''). Based on a novel called ``Dr. Liver'' and set near
the end of World War II, it unfolds with comic sprightliness in a
seaside village near Hiroshima, where the health of the doctor's
friends and neighbors is generally no laughing matter. The film's
blend of frank earthiness, harsh flippancy, bizarre kinks and
flashes of unlikely formal beauty may not do much to make liver
disease riveting. But they do make the septuagenarian Imamura
arguably the youngest-hearted filmmaker in Japan (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE GENERAL,'' starring Brendan Gleeson and Jon Voight.
Directed by John Boorman (not rated, 125 minutes). Boorman's best
and most stylish film in years is the deftly told story of Martin
Cahill. Nicknamed ``the General'' for his crime-plotting
strategies, this Irish gang leader and master thief is played with
splendid brio by Gleeson. Photographed gorgeously in black and
white, the film tells of his elaborate art and jewel heists, his
unusual domestic arrangement with his wife's sister and his
singular difficulties with the IRA and the law. Voight is
outstandingly good as the police detective who knows all of
Cahill's tricks (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``IN DREAMS,'' starring Annette Bening, Aidan Quinn and Robert
Downey Jr. Directed by Neil Jordan (R, 112 minutes). At heart this
is just a campfire story, and a pretty loony one at that. But
Jordan directs it furiously a la ``Interview With the Vampire''
with a lush, insinuating visual style that gets right under the
skin. Working with the inventive cinematographer Darius Khondji, he
stirs up a nightmare brooding and intuitive enough to recall at
times the richly textured mysteries of Nicolas Roeg's ``Don't Look
Now.'' Ms. Bening plays a psychic plagued by the thoughts of a
serial killer, whom Downey makes as bizarre and disturbing as he
can, in a performance that makes this story's craziest dreams come
true (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``MISSISSIPPI MERMAID,'' starring Catherine Deneuve and
Jean-Paul Belmondo. Directed by Francois Truffaut (not rated, 123
minutes). The Film Forum (209 West Houston St. in New York)
continues its two-week run of this bewitching, circuitous love
story in the guise of a globe-trotting caper film, with Ms. Deneuve
and Belmondo at their most dazzling. She plays a demure mail-order
bride who swindles Belmondo's wealthy tobacco grower, and by the
time she is revealed to be a con woman, the intrigue is over _ but
that's where the romance really starts. Rarely shown theatrically,
it now includes 13 especially tender, character-revealing moments
that had been cut for the film's 1970 American release (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``PATCH ADAMS,'' starring Robin Williams and Monica Potter.
Directed by Tom Shadyac (PG-13, 110 minutes). As a maverick doctor
intent on making terminal patients laugh, Williams delivers a
little clowning and a lot of maudlin feel-good sentiment, along
with vulgarity left over from the filmmaker's ``Ace Ventura'' days.
He also spends a lot of time being congratulated for his good
works, as the film's minor players are kept busy marveling at his
antics. The real-life story of this doctor may sound like a fine
excuse for Williams to cut loose, but the film version proves
narrow and predictable. Ms. Potter, with a nostrilly resemblance to
Julia Roberts, figures in a romantic subplot with a bizarre twist
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE PRINCE OF EGYPT,'' starring the voices of Val Kilmer,
Ralph Fiennes and Michelle Pfeiffer. Directed by Brenda Chapman,
Steve Hickner and Simon Wells (PG, 93 minutes). First came the
great expectations for this animated magnum opus from Dreamworks.
Then came reality, in a film struggling mightily to balance
animated whimsy and biblical stature. The upshot is an admirably
worthy rendering of the Exodus story, even if Moses must initially
be seen as a playful young scamp. Biblical plagues and miracles
serve as special inspiration for the animators' reality-bending
ingenuity (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``PRIVATE CONFESSIONS,'' starring Pernilla August and Max Von
Sydow. Written by Ingmar Bergman. Directed by Liv Ullmann (not
rated, 127 minutes). The pedigree is irresistible, the screenplay
often wrenchingly astute, as Bergman delves with wisdom into a
spiritual and marital crisis experienced by his mother. In a film
directed by Ms. Ullmann with Bergmanesque watchfulness, and with
enough assurance to recall his devastating ``Scenes From a
Marriage,'' an adulterous liaison becomes a defining event in the
life of a lonely, restless woman. Set mostly in 1925, the film also
visits her past and her future, and features a formidable
performance from Von Sydow and from Ms. August, passionately
extending upon her ``Best Intentions'' role (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE,'' starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth
Paltrow, Geoffrey Rush, Ben Affleck and Judi Dench. Directed by
John Madden (R, 113 minutes). A witty, sexy and merrily literate
delight, with an exhilaratingly clever premise that only gets
better as the film unfolds. The screenplay, originating as Marc
Norman's brainstorm and turned by Tom Stoppard into razor-sharp
dialogue reminiscent of his ``Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are
Dead,'' dares to imagine whatever it likes about the link between
Shakespeare's artistic passions and his mad yearning for a certain
aristocratic beauty. Meanwhile this tirelessly inventive comedy
envisions an Elizabethan theater fraught with the same backbiting
and conniving we enjoy today, and has great fun presenting the
creation of ``Romeo and Juliet,'' glitches and all. Fiennes and Ms.
Paltrow make a fine, tempestuous duo, and she gives the first
great, fully realized starring performance of her career (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``A SIMPLE PLAN,'' starring Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton and
Bridget Fonda. Directed by Sam Raimi (R, 120 minutes). This
one-time cult horror director makes a flawless transition to
mainstream storytelling with a quietly devastating thriller. And
its fine cast plays out the consequences of a harmless-sounding
error in judgment that winds up leveling everything in its path.
The catalyst is $4.4 million that literally falls out of the sky,
and Scott Smith's story proves how deadly the morality of
expediency can become. When you get the shivers watching this
wintry tale, which features an especially memorable performance
from Thornton, it won't be from the cold (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``STEPMOM,'' starring Susan Sarandon, Julia Roberts and Ed
Harris. Directed by Chris Columbus (PG-13, 120 minutes). A man's
ex-wife and new girlfriend lock horns over who can be nicer to his
two children, in a sudsy story made livelier by its two female
stars, both in appealingly high gear. Ms. Roberts plays the nicest
person ever to wear black to a downtown photo shoot, while the
especially fiery Ms. Sarandon plays the suburban mother as mama
lion. Even when the prospect of mortality looms, the story manages
to maintain its big, lavish look and peculiar (under the
circumstances) sense of fun. As in ``Home Alone,'' Columbus directs
with sunny indifference to reality, medical, economic or otherwise
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE THIN RED LINE,'' starring Jim Caviezel, Ben Chaplin, Nick
Nolte, Sean Penn and Woody Harrelson. Directed by Terrence Malick
(R, 166 minutes). From the first frame of this huge, drifting war
epic loosely derived from James Jones' Guadalcanal novel, it's
viscerally clear that Malick is back. The exquisite, oddly detached
visual style that made ``Badlands'' and ``Days of Heaven'' the most
beautiful films of the 1970s is instantly apparent here, even if
the narrative vagueness and brooding voice-overs are also familiar.
The film sprawls, gets lost and occasionally delivers visual
poetry, the kind that could have been greatly helped by tighter
editing. Bottom line: No one who admired Malick's early work should
miss this. But those expecting anything simple will not find it
here (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``YOU'VE GOT MAIL,'' starring Meg Ryan, Tom Hanks, Greg Kinnear
and Parker Posey. Directed by Nora Ephron (PG, 110 minutes). This
cozy, inviting comedy romanticizes the rivalry between two
bookstore owners, while also finding time to fall in love with
books themselves, the instant intimacy of e-mail and a
picture-perfect rendering of New York's Upper West Side. With a
feel-good ambience much less forced than that of ``Sleepless in
Seattle,'' Ms. Ephron borrows adroitly from ``The Shop Around the
Corner'' while making this knowing, urbanely funny film very much
her own. Ms. Ryan is fresh and adorable without trying, while a
ruefully lovelorn Hanks proves that he can do anything. Again
(Maslin).

 &HT;    GOVERNORS SEEK RACIAL AND POLITICAL CALM
 &HT;    (w/GOVERNORS23-QUOTES-COX)
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With their state treasuries overflowing, governors
from coast to coast called this month for more civility and
cooperation between diverse ethnic groups and political parties.
</P>
<P>
   A Cox Newspapers review of inaugural or ``state of the state''
addresses this month by more than 40 of the 50 governors showed
that three themes _ less confrontation, higher spending on
education, and lower taxes _ popped up in almost every major
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Their priorities are similar mostly because the governors are in
touch with what their constituents want in this prosperous era,
according to political scientist Laura Van Assendelft of Mary
Baldwin College in Virginia. The author of ``Governors, Agenda
Setting and Divided Government,'' Van Assendelft said that was
especially true of the 22 re-elected and 12 newly elected just two
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, they propose things the people want,'' she said.
``When I did research for my book in 1994, economic development was
hot. Now you have a president who has prioritized education, and,
with the economy doing well, tax cuts and tax relief are bound to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The calls for racial and ethnic harmony come after an election
year in which black and Hispanic voter turnout was higher than
usual and decisive in some races.
</P>
<P>
   Such calls also could appeal in a non-threatening way to ``the
moral agenda, the whole idea that we've become a godless country
that has lost its moral bearings,'' suggested sociologist Paul
Luebke, who is also a Democratic state representative in the North
Carolina Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   In Vermont, only 11 percent of the school children in
Burlington, the state's largest city, are from racial minorities.
But that was enough to draw comment from the state's Democratic
governor, Howard Dean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because Vermont is only now becoming a diverse, multicultural
state, we have an opportunity to avoid mistakes made elsewhere,''
Dean said. ``It is extraordinarily important that we begin now to
set a tone which condemns racism and makes sure that all citizens
are equal and accorded the respect they deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Texans don't belong in little ethnic and racial boxes (like
those) all over the world, in places with names like Kosovo,
Bosnia, Rwanda,'' Republican Gov. George Bush said in Austin. ``As
we head into the 21st Century, we should have one box: American.''
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, the oath taken by Democrat Roy Barnes, who is white,
was administered by his old college friend, Robert Benham, chief
justice of the Georgia supreme court.
</P>
<P>
   ``One is white, and the other is black,'' Barnes said. ``This
act, which would have been impossible 100 years ago, shows Georgia
at its best, as a place where neither race, gender, nor geography
will ever divide us.''
</P>
<P>
   As always, there were exceptions. In Mississippi, Republican
Kirk Fordice complained that for two years in a row the legislature
has buried his bill to rename a stretch of Interstate 20 for the
31st Infantry ``Dixie'' Division, formed during World War I from
the white National Guard troops of several southern states.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I still don't get it,'' Fordice said. ``But, if that's
the way this system works, I hope I never do.''
</P>
<P>
   But far to his west, Republican Bill Janklow was forthright in
deploring divides between South Dakotans of Native American,
European and Asian descent.
</P>
<P>
   When he looks back at the end of this new term, Janklow said,
``If there is one person of red skin or white skin or yellow skin
or brown skin who truly and honestly feels like they are
unacceptable and unaccepted and don't belong with everybody else,
I'm going to be a failure in my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Even farther west, in California, Democrat Gray Davis declared:
``In recent years we've had too much scapegoating and
finger-pointing.... So tonight I propose a four-year moratorium on
wedge-issue politics.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD THAT CAN STAND ALONE AS A
</ANNOTATION>
SIDEBAR FOLLOWS)
<P>
   Calls for avoiding partisanship were natural in Minnesota, where
Gov. Jesse Ventura of the Reform Party has to wrestle with a
legislature in which Democrats and Republicans each control one
chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must put down the partisan party politics and look at the
bigger picture,'' said Ventura. Like many governors, he faces a
relatively painless political dilemma: How to split a budget
surplus _ rather than how to cope with a deficit.
</P>
<P>
   He's not alone. Revenues in the current budget year are running
ahead of projections in at least 46 states, according to the Fiscal
Survey of the States, sponsored by the National Association of
State Budget Officers and the National Governors Association.
</P>
<P>
   Mid-year budget corrections to avoid deficits have been needed
this year only in three states: Nevada, where gambling faces more
competition from other states; Hawaii, which attracts fewer
tourists from troubled Asia; and Alaska, which was hurt by the
worldwide drop in the price of oil.
</P>
<P>
   Most states also expect continued prosperity and higher revenues
next year, even if they give some of their surpluses back to the
taxpayers in rebates or rate cuts.
</P>
<P>
   There are two exceptions:
</P>
<P>
   -- Governors are still worried that the federal government will
try to seize some of the 25-year revenue windfall expected from the
tobacco suits the states settled with tobacco companies last year.
Several are counting on that money to balance their state budgets.
</P>
<P>
   -- Future revenue is uncertain in a broad swath of Plains states
stretching from Texas to North Dakota, where farmers and ranchers
have been devastated by droughts that damaged cotton crops, row
crops, dairy production and rangeland, and by over-production that
crushed prices for hogs, cattle and grain.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Texas, estimates are that as many as 25 percent of the
region's producers _ particularly small to mid-size farms with no
off-farm income source _ will discontinue production over the
year,'' the Fiscal Survey said.
</P>
<P>
   In North Dakota, Republican Gov. Ed Schafer said, ``Although the
farmers and ranchers continue to face major problems caused by poor
weather and garage-sale prices, we can be encouraged by recent
reports of many farmers who used alternative crops and forward
contracting to shelter their losses.''
</P>
<P>
   But even in those states, unemployment remained near the lowest
levels in history. Though they restrained themselves, most
governors this year could have summed up their state's prospects in
the one-word yelp that closed Ventura's inaugural address:
``Hoo-yah!''

`ANOTHER DAY IN PARADISE': HURTLING DOWN THE ROAD TO RUIN
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes at end of review) 
(DW) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``So you two are Bonnie and Clyde, eh?'' Melanie
Griffith asks a pair of druggy young lovebirds in ``Another Day in
Paradise,'' the second unapologetically seedy feature directed by
Larry Clark. ``So are we.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because the one big happy pseudo-family wobbling through
this improbably vibrant road movie consists of two middle-aged
junkies (Ms. Griffith and a full-throttle James Woods) and two sexy
young things (Vincent Kartheiser and Natasha Gregson Wagner), all
in the throes of a shared case of the outlaw blues.
</P>
<P>
   From the director of the bruising and ominous ``Kids,'' this is
a virtual day at the beach. Clark presents it with the spontaneous
lurid zeal that so many other filmmakers work so hard to fake.
Trading the assertive grittiness of ``Kids'' for a more exuberant
visual style, he brings bizarrely innocent enthusiasm to material
that would otherwise ooze shock value, and merely shrugs off those
parts of this story that would be easiest to exploit.
</P>
<P>
   Decadence here is as basic as the weather, and as impervious to
criticism or change. ``Kinda pretty for something so ugly, huh?''
Ms. Wagner's character muses. For Clark's newly tantalizing
directorial style, that says it all.
</P>
<P>
   Though Clark's photo essay ``Tulsa'' remains a model for so much
film imagery steeped in junkie cachet, he himself seems oblivious
to its sensationalism, even while filming Ms. Griffith sticking a
needle into her groin. As he demonstrates here, he sees no reason
that four passengers on the road to ruin can't at least enjoy the
ride, especially when the guy at the wheel is such a character.
</P>
<P>
   In the closest thing here to a grown-up role, Woods revels in
the chance to play a gleeful blowhard with a nice-guy side, to the
point where one of the film's impressionable younger characters
even mistakes him for a doctor. ``No, kid,'' he answers
reassuringly. ``I'm just a junkie and a real good thief.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark, a filmmaker for whom sleaze and eroticism are inseparably
intertwined, begins with angelic images of Bobbie ( Kartheiser) and
Rosie (Ms. Wagner) asleep together, and already shows more warmth
than there was in all of ``Kids.'' If ``Another Day in Paradise''
has none of the cautionary urgency that gave ``Kids'' its power, it
does have a considerably more inviting gloss.
</P>
<P>
   Not even when Bobbie starts the day with a vicious vending
machine robbery and beating does the film, adapted by Stephen Chin
and Christopher Landon from a book by Eddie Little, lose its sense
of all things being relative in the world of petty crime. Bobbie is
just a small-timer whose exploits pale before the promises held
forth by Woods, in the role of a flamboyant, drug-dealing loose
cannon named Mel.
</P>
<P>
   Though Mel tries to lure Bobbie and Rosie into a world of more
serious crime, he actually holds a key to redemption; Mel winds up
jolting these two out of their daze and turns ``Another Day in
Paradise'' into a story of being scared straight. But Clark, as
should be eminently clear, is not one for moralizing. He shows much
more interest in conjuring the day-by-day details of this
foursome's wild ride, especially after Mel's girlfriend, Sidney
(Ms. Griffith), starts feeling maternal toward the two young losers
in training.
</P>
<P>
   This film's idea of motherliness is Sidney's taking Rosie on a
shopping spree at a place where the salesgirls are in hot pants,
and sharing girl talk while shooting up in the dressing room. (Ms.
Griffith looks very ``Charlie's Angels,'' as part of the film's
vague 70s flavor.)
</P>
<P>
   We hear a little about the past (Sidney hooked up with Mel when
he was her drug dealer). We glimpse enough of the future, with
Brent Briscoe as a white supremacist thug with whom Mel insists on
doing business, and Lou Diamond Phillips as a malevolent gang
leader in drag, to know it won't be bright.
</P>
<P>
   But Clark's main gift is for living furiously with his
characters in the moment, as Eric Edwards' hand-held camera work
swerves and pivots and the soundtrack pulsates with a bluesy,
smoldering score featuring Clarence Carter. His second, more benign
film delivers what his first promised: bad times with a wicked way
of looking good.
</P>

   WASHINGTON _ Here is a sampler of quotations from speeches this
month by state governors:
</P>
<P>
   ``Our tough new (drunk driving) laws and aggressive public
education must send a simple and blunt message: Drive Hammered, Get
Nailed.'' _ Jane Dee Hull (R) Arizona
</P>
<P>
   ``You (elected officials) will discover soon enough that on some
days you're the pigeon and on some days you're the statue, and more
often than not, the statue.'' _ Mike Huckabee (R) Arkansas
</P>
<P>
   ``The only government in history to promise more than the United
States liberals was the former Soviet Union. There is yet room in
the garbage dump of history if we are determined to share its
philosophy and its fate.'' _ Kirk Fordice (R) Mississippi
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the Commonwealth has a right _ and I would say a
duty _ to ban the transportation of garbage on Virginia's
waterways.'' _ Jim Gilmore (R) Virginia
</P>
<P>
   ``Forces beyond our state borders threaten our growth and our
future. Federal bureaucrats use oppressive, unreasonable
regulations and international treaties to impose air quality
standards that jeopardize thousands of West Virginia jobs.'' _
Cecil Underwood (R) West Virginia
</P>
<P>
   ``For the long term, we continue to press for a more realistic
correlation between the limited fiscal capacity of government, and
the public's unlimited demand for services.'' _ Ben Cayetano (D)
Hawaii
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is no single education challenge of greater urgency
than the need to make sure every Ohio student learns how to read.''
_ Bob Taft (R) Ohio
</P>
<P>
   ``It should come as no surprise to anyone that this will be a

JOSEPH KALICHSTEIN: A FREQUENT COLLABORATOR GOES SOLO 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Joseph Kalichstein's performances as the pianist in
the Kalichstein-Laredo-Robinson Trio and in collaborations with
other ensembles have always been eloquent and impassioned, and his
recent appointment as chamber music adviser to the Kennedy Center
in Washington is clearly a measure of the importance of the chamber
repertory to him. He is heard less frequently in New York as a
soloist, and his recital at Carnegie Hall on Wednesday evening
suggested that concertgoers are missing something by not hearing
more of Kalichstein on his own.
</P>
<P>
   Kalichstein has qualities in common with pianists like Richard
Goode and Alfred Brendel: He is a musician who searches beyond the
dots on the page, recognizes the breadth of possibilities within a
work and has the technique to give those possibilities life.
Judging from his admirably detailed program notes, an aspect of a
performance most musicians leave to others, he is also engaged by
the history and structure of the music he offers.
</P>
<P>
   Two thematic currents ran through Kalichstein's program. One was
a fascination with ``La Folia,'' a dance based on a simple
minor-key chord progression that was popular in Renaissance Spain
and Portugal and became the basis of countless Baroque Sarabandes
and 18th- and 19th-century variation sets. A dozen ``Folia''
variations by C.P.E. Bach opened the program, and works by Ezequiel
Vinao and Liszt, also based on ``La Folia,'' closed it.
</P>
<P>
   Kalichstein's second theme was the development of the Fantasy,
represented by Schumann's ``Kreisleriana,'' Mendelssohn's Fantasy
in F sharp minor (Op. 28) and the Vinao and Liszt works, which
formed a bridge between the Fantasy and ``La Folia.''
</P>
<P>
   Themes aside, Kalichstein's account of the Bach was interesting
for the light it shed on the importance of texture and context.
These variations were composed for a keyboard that produced a much
lighter sound than Kalichstein's modern Steinway, yet his
performance argued persuasively that the music's implications
stretch far beyond what the composer knew.
</P>
<P>
   A listener who heard _ and enjoyed hearing _ anachronistic hints
of soft-focus, Impressionistic harmony in one variation and brash,
modernistic chromaticism in another, had the feeling of being party
to a conspiracy with Kalichstein to subvert models of historical
progression and propriety.
</P>
<P>
   Kalichstein let the other works sing mostly on their own terms.
The split personality that enlivens Schumann's music gives a
pianist plenty to work with, and in that sense, ``Kreisleriana,''
his evocation of a character from E.T.A. Hoffmann, is a gold mine.
Kalichstein moved easily between its stretches of turbulent, manic
emotionalism and its moments of calm, sweet-toned lyricism, and he
found the perfect resolution in the playful, light-spirited finale.
</P>
<P>
   The Mendelssohn Fantasy, though somewhat more concise and
carefully ordered, touched on extremes similar to those in the
Schumann. It also requires considerable finger power in its second
movement, as does the Liszt, and Kalichstein met its demands
without letting the music lapse into mere display.
</P>
<P>
   Vinao's Fantasy, which was composed for Kalichstein, began by
dissecting the ``Folia'' theme, casting embellished shards into the
upper reaches of the keyboard and broader structural elements deep
into the bass. A gradual reconciliation led to an appearance of
``La Folia'' in its traditional form, but with filigree in the
treble darting over the progression like electric charges.
</P>
<P>
   Those embellishments quickly overwhelmed the theme and became
the focus of further elaboration before being pushed aside in favor
of an exploration of the rhythms of ``La Folia.'' There was a lot
to engage the imagination in Vinao's work, and Kalichstein played
it with an evident sense of engagement.

SAVED BY THE BOMBSHELL, OR SO THEY HOPE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ As I write this, I'm listening to a
talk-radio host go on about Carmen Electra, both her body of work
and her body. He has apparently read or at least sniffed through
Neal Gabler's book on how entertainment has taken over nearly every
facet of our lives, because he's convinced that Electra falls into
``The Zsa Zsa factor,'' which Gabler describes in Chapter 4 of
``Life the Movie'' as celebrities famous merely for being famous.
</P>
<P>
   Electra has done SOMETHING, I'm certain. It just depends on your
idea of what ``something'' constitutes and whether it warrants a
radio forum. She was once paired with The Artist during his Prince
days and later stepped into a jiggle-and-wiggle role on the
syndicated ``Baywatch,'' playing one of the scantily clad
lifeguards always running in slo-mo. That led her to loftier
opportunities, like host of MTV's lusty dating game show, ``Singled
Out.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, she received her biggest headlines yet after a
seemingly impromptu wedding to professional hoopster Dennis Rodman.
Coverage of the marriage took on bizarre proportions, partly
because those two were involved, and partly because Rodman's agent
immediately announced the whole thing was just a mistake. (As
though they'd accidentally wandered into a chapel and hooked up
with a justice of the peace.)
</P>
<P>
   Rather conveniently, Electra was beginning work as a regular on
the drama ``Hyperion Bay'' when this Rodman mess hit. Her character
shows up on the first-year series starting Monday, and the WB,
having seemingly spent its promotional budget launching the sitcom
``Zoe, Duncan, Jack &AMP; Jane,'' couldn't be happier with her
snowballing publicity campaign. (Electra has appeared on ``E!,''
``Entertainment Tonight'' and ``Extra,'' whose story consisted
mainly of the newlyweds having separate residences.)
</P>
<P>
   Showing up recently at a press event orchestrated by the WB
network, Electra was mobbed by reporters. (New ``Hyperion Bay''
producer Frank South and stars Mark-Paul Gosselaar, Sydney Penny
and Christina Moore caused far less commotion.)
</P>
<P>
   Not that they'll mind if this sexification works. The first step
of such a retooling is to get people re-energized. The second is
execution. The third is the selling of the entire package of new
story lines, wardrobe, set designs, even characters, since every
one of the show's major core players has developed a new sexual
aggression.
</P>
<P>
   This is where South comes in. He sexed up ``Melrose Place'' by
hiring Heather Locklear and adding a high level of bumping and
grinding. A similar formula _ actually, the exact same formula _ is
being applied here. Literally overnight, each character's senses
have been ignited. They're angrier, less patient, less thoughtful,
more lustful. In many instances, dialogue has been replaced by the
visual _ namely the lethal mix of sex and violence.
</P>
<P>
   One scene in an upcoming episode involves a stalker slashing
tires as two people make love. Another shows Trudy (Cassidy Rae)
dropping her dress to a surprised Dennis (Gosselaar), only to be
upstaged by a burning building in the foreground.
</P>
<P>
   Electra's Sarah Hicks makes her entrance Monday as the daughter
of the high-tech mogul. Her motives are unclear, although ruthless
and heartless are two of her personality traits. Her business
attire keeps her measurements well-hidden, but expect layers to be
shed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to bring her on immediately just to say, look,
we have someone really hot,'' says South. ``I felt she'd come in as
a character with an attitude and mystery behind her, a woman to be
reckoned with. A woman who is to be reckoned with won't be taking
off her clothes right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course. Not right away.
</P>
<P>
   Gosselaar is being business-savvy about the Electra factor.
``With the ratings we were getting, there had to be a change,'' he
says. ``The choice was cancellation or bring in someone new.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a last-ditch effort to save a series that for all
intents and purposes should have been canned. But at what price, I
wonder?
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, we're keeping the intelligence of the show,'' promises
South. ``We're keeping the writing level very high. We're not just
throwing junk up there and getting flashy. We're not bed-hopping.
I'm not interested in a body count.''
</P>
<P>
   Just ratings. ``High drama forces characters to open up,'' he
says. ``We need to make the show unusual, even if it means
introducing someone like Carmen. I mean, it's kind of amazing how
she's built this audience in such a short time.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah. Amazing.

ELIA KAZAN CHANGED FILM AND ACTING FOREVER. FINALLY, OSCAR GIVES
HIM HIS DUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is awarding
director Elia Kazan a special Oscar to salute his body of work.
It's about time.
</P>
<P>
   The American Film Institute _ the organization that gave us the
controversial list of the 100 greatest movies of all time last year
_ has honored with its lifetime award such film figures as Billy
Wilder, Frank Capra and Alfred Hitchcock. The joke used to be if
you were lucky, the AFI would reward you with an award while you
could still hear them. But they've ignored a director who is truly
influential, and sadly, truly controversial: Kazan.
</P>
<P>
   Controversial, because he named names when questioned by the
House Un-American Activities Committee, repudiating his former
pro-communism stance. There are many who've never forgiven him.
</P>
<P>
   With its hard-headed stance, the AFI will not acknowledge one of
the most important people ever to work in the medium. So it's
doubly sweet that the academy has. (And it could provide a boost to
the interminable awards show, set for March 21, as well; the best
moment of last year's show was when sprightly musicals director
Stanley Donen bounced to the stage, breaking into a friendly
soft-shoe number as he accepted his lifetime award.)
</P>
<P>
   Just try to imagine movies without Kazan. Imagine movies
without, probably, the most famous scene in the history of movies.
Marlon Brando _ forlorn, exposed, angry _ talking to his brother
(Rod Steiger), and giving the ``I coulda been a contender'' speech
in 1954's ``On the Waterfront.'' The acting in the scene is both
raw and contained, brash and honest. The excitement of that
unvarnished creativity was part of a series of movies _ ``A
Streetcar Named Desire'' and ``East of Eden'' among them _ that
crushed the old style of italicized, representational acting. As
much as people loved the vividness of actors like Cary Grant and
James Stewart, they immediately became obsolete. This more natural
acting came from the director of those films, Elia Kazan, one of
the co-founders of the Actors Studio, the school that changed the
way American actors approached their work.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Actors Studio _ and the Method, the exercises that
studio devotees used to find the truth of their characters _ there
was an unspoken, but implicit, inferiority complex that weighed
down American actors. They lacked the tradition of British stage
performers, with their swiftness and brittle professionalism _ that
Old World concept of ``class.''
</P>
<P>
   In early films, you can see American actors racing through their
lines and scenes in an attempt to approximate that Brit
stylization. When Kazan brought the Method _ and its early avatar,
Brando _ to the screen, it was at first ridiculed; Brando was
dismissed as a brooding mumbler because he didn't employ the
sparkling, ringing enunciation of stagy, old-fashioned acting.
</P>
<P>
   You could say that Kazan was part of the first wave to finally
free Americans from the weight of British popular culture on our
necks, a wave that came to include be-bop and rock 'n' roll. He
legitimized American restlessness in acting. (It was also Kazan who
directed Brando on stage in the legendary ``Truckline Cafe,'' about
which New Yorker film critic Pauline Kael wrote, ``I looked up and
saw what I thought was an actor having a seizure on stage.
Embarrassed for him, I lowered my eyes, and it wasn't until the
young man who'd brought me said `Watch this guy' that I realized he
was acting.'')
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just with men that Kazan succeeded as a director. In
the high-energy farce ``Baby Doll,'' one of the funniest, and
sexiest, movies ever made, Kazan toys with the Southern archetypes
of Faulkner, but he pulls a juicy, vibrant performance out of
Carroll Baker as the teen-aged heartbreaker who has Karl Malden
cross-eyed with lust. (''Baby Doll'' is an All-American version of
``Lolita''). And Julie Harris in ``East of Eden'' is poetic, rapt
in her attention to the suffering James Dean. And the very young
Lee Remick, all dewy-skinned alertness in ``A Face in the Crowd,''
benefits from his attention. Kazan almost manages to get a
performance out of Natalie Wood in 1961's ``Splendor in the
Grass.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the things that Kazan did with Dean was to change the
role of actors in movies. Dean's wounded, bruised performance in
``Eden'' would have previously been laughed off the screen as weak
and emasculated. (In fact, many of his detractors called it just
that.) But Dean's boy-ingenue turn _ he cried out to be mended _
showed that a man could display vulnerability and still be a
protagonist. In ``Eden,'' Raymond Massey seems to be recoiling from
Dean's bewildering presence; you can almost read ``What is he
doing?'' in the thought balloon over Massey's head.
</P>
<P>
   1957's ``A Face in the Crowd'' gives a sly air of menace to a
man who made his career spinning gentle stories that wound slowly
to their point: Andy Griffith. Griffith's relish in playing the
charming, manipulative half-sociopath who becomes the most powerful
on-air figure in America is palpable. It's an odd movie for Kazan,
too, because he uses it as a 2-by-4 to slam the dangers of a media
that can hypnotize and turn ruination into entertainment for the
unthinking masses.
</P>
<P>
   The House Un-American Activities Committee hearings are the
subtext, and ``Face'' is a little too apt, but pat. It contains
those elements that are at the heart of all of Kazan's best work,
though: seduction and betrayal. Elements that run through his own
life, as well. In his autobiography, ``A Life,'' Kazan apologizes
for the acts that finished off any consideration of him as a
serious artistic force. It was a horrible thing, and he went too
far. He finished off careers, too. Those he named went into hiding.
There are those who will never forgive, which is why Kazan has
virtually been reduced to a footnote.
</P>
<P>
   But since even Richard Nixon was absolved and granted elder
statesman status, it's more than time for Kazan to be granted a
clean slate. After all, he is a contender.

 &HT;    UNDER SIEGE: OLYMPIC OFFICIALS MEET AIR SCANDAL ALLEGATIONS
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (s) Sports categories.
 &HT;    For Use Sat., Jan. 23 And Thereafter.

<P>
   LONDON _ The International Olympic Committee executive board,
gathering for perhaps the most important weekend in the history of
the 105-year-old institution, on Saturday will begin hearing the
defenses of as many as 16 committee members accused of accepting
bribes during Salt Lake City's campaign for the 2002 Games.
</P>
<P>
   The accused and accusers in the Olympic bidding scandal, who
began arriving Friday at IOC headquarters in Switzerland, have for
the most part remained mum on the situation -- a testament to the
chilling effect the escalating scandal has had, so far.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while it is becoming clear that the IOC intends to
follow its investigation of Salt
</P>
<P>
   Lake City's bid with a review of previous efforts dating back to
the campaign for the 1996 Games, it is not certain how such an
inquiry would be conducted. The Games were awarded to Atlanta in
1990 following a three-year campaign that cost $7.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Pound, the Canadian IOC member leading the investigation,
told a Toronto
</P>
<P>
   newspaper Wednesday that allegations of corruption have plagued
the city selection process for years. He suggested that going back
as far as the campaign for the 1996
</P>
<P>
   Games would help restore public and sponsor trust in the IOC.
''Even if the behavior were to be criminal -- which it's not --
there's a five-year limitation period,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''So if you go back to the '96 Games, you're talking about nine
years. I think as a good-faith gesture, that's plenty.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Atlanta Olympics chief Billy Payne has denied that his
committee did anything improper in its campaign for the Games and
said he would welcome a full review.
</P>
<P>
   Pound, who was the IOC liaison for the Atlanta Olympics, and
other IOC officials have stressed that they have no evidence of any
wrongdoing in the bid for the 1996 Games. Yet, rumors and news
accounts of extravagant gifts and favors persist and may merit
another look, they say. But first, the executive board must
authorize Pound's commission to expand its probe into previous
bids.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the IOC members implicated in the Salt Lake City
campaign will
</P>
<P>
   make their cases to the IOC's executive board behind closed
doors at the committee's
</P>
<P>
   offices at Chateau de Vidy. Reporters will be barred from the
offices, where press
</P>
<P>
   briefings routinely have been held for years. Press conferences
will he held at the
</P>
<P>
   Olympic Museum a few miles away.
</P>
<P>
   An unusual air of gravity has fallen over IOC headquarters,
which have been besieged by press inquiries from around the world.
Olympic insiders place the Salt Lake City bidding scandal among the
most difficult and potentially damaging episodes in Olympic history
alongside the U.S. boycott of the 1980 Moscow Games and the
drug-related expulsion of Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson from the
1988 Seoul Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Dick Pound the other day, and I got the strong
sense that he thought this was easily the gravest crisis he's
encountered,'' said Sir Bob Scott, the chief of Manchester's
unsuccessful bids for the 1996 and 2000 Games.
</P>
<P>
   Scott believes that such a highly publicized scandal is also
deeply disturbing to IOC
</P>
<P>
   President Juan Antonio Samaranch, who led the Games from near
bankruptcy in 1980 to its standing now as multi-billion dollar
industry. Samaranch, 78, has said he
</P>
<P>
   will retire in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hates this,'' Scott said. ``He knows that the real
marketing motif of the IOC is whiteness and purity, as it were. The
moment that gets sullied, that's when the Olympics lose value, and
that's when the real trouble starts. That's his great worry.''
</P>
<P>
   The format of the proceedings Saturday and Sunday is not being
disclosed, said Philip Furrer, an IOC spokesman. Even though it has
been widely reported that as many
</P>
<P>
   as 16 members have been accused of questionable behavior, the
IOC will not confirm
</P>
<P>
   the number.
</P>
<P>
   All those implicated have responded to letters written by
Samaranch outlining the allegations. One member of the IOC has
resigned, while several other IOC members have disputed the
allegations in writing. Pound's four-member commission reviewed
their responses Wednesday in New York.
</P>
<P>
   An undisclosed number have indicated they will appear before the
executive board in person.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some but not all will come,'' said Furrer, who expects that
they probably will
</P>
<P>
   complete their defenses and explanations on Saturday. The
executive board will meet
</P>
<P>
   again Sunday morning and then release the results of the
month-long investigation in the early evening.
</P>
<P>
   The accused members can resign or face expulsion by the full
114-member IOC,
</P>
<P>
   which has been called back to Lausanne in March for a special
session to deal with the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   A two-thirds vote of that session is required for expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the damage to its image, the IOC is deeply
concerned about the prospect of getting caught up in the U.S.
criminal investigation. ``We will have to
</P>
<P>
   consider what the position of the IOC will be if we are served
with a subpoena to appear in front of a grand jury,'' said a draft
report of Pound's report obtained by The Wall Street Journal.
``This is a particularly odious procedural part of criminal law in
which the accused virtually have no rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound's 24-page draft report alleged the IOC members accepted
more than $780,000 in payments and gifts from Salt Lake City
Olympic officials, the newspaper reported. Pound, a Montreal lawyer
and former Olympic swimmer, has said that the instances of
corruption engaged in by some IOC members are serious.

   ``When you see it in black and white, it's pretty blatant stuff,
so I don't think the people involved are going to be able to

</P>
<P>
   Thirteen IOC members have been implicated publicly in the
corruption scandal. They are from Ecuador, Libya, Sudan, Finland,
Congo Republic, the Netherlands, Ivory Coast, Mali, South Korea,

Haeggman, resigned Tuesday.

   The IOC investigation is one of five looking into allegations of
wrongdoing connected with Salt Lake City's Olympics bid. The
Justice Department, the U.S. Olympic Committee, the Salt Lake
organizing committee and the Utah attorney general are conducting
separate inquiries.

<P>
   LONDON _ The International Olympic Committee executive board,
gathering for perhaps the most important weekend in the history of
the 105-year-old institution, on Saturday will begin hearing the
defenses of as many as 16 committee members accused of accepting
bribes during Salt Lake City's campaign for the 2002 Games.
</P>
<P>
   The accused and accusers in the Olympic bidding scandal, who
began arriving Friday at IOC headquarters in Switzerland, have for
the most part remained mum on the situation -- a testament to the
chilling effect the escalating scandal has had, so far.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while it is becoming clear that the IOC intends to
follow its investigation of Salt
</P>
<P>
   Lake City's bid with a review of previous efforts dating back to
the campaign for the 1996 Games, it is not certain how such an
inquiry would be conducted. The Games were awarded to Atlanta in
1990 following a three-year campaign that cost $7.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Pound, the Canadian IOC member leading the investigation,
told a Toronto
</P>
<P>
   newspaper Wednesday that allegations of corruption have plagued
the city selection process for years. He suggested that going back
as far as the campaign for the 1996
</P>
<P>
   Games would help restore public and sponsor trust in the IOC.
''Even if the behavior were to be criminal -- which it's not --
there's a five-year limitation period,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''So if you go back to the '96 Games, you're talking about nine
years. I think as a good-faith gesture, that's plenty.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Atlanta Olympics chief Billy Payne has denied that his
committee did anything improper in its campaign for the Games and
said he would welcome a full review.
</P>
<P>
   Pound, who was the IOC liaison for the Atlanta Olympics, and
other IOC officials have stressed that they have no evidence of any
wrongdoing in the bid for the 1996 Games. Yet, rumors and news
accounts of extravagant gifts and favors persist and may merit
another look, they say. But first, the executive board must
authorize Pound's commission to expand its probe into previous
bids.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the IOC members implicated in the Salt Lake City
campaign will
</P>
<P>
   make their cases to the IOC's executive board behind closed
doors at the committee's
</P>
<P>
   offices at Chateau de Vidy. Reporters will be barred from the
offices, where press
</P>
<P>
   briefings routinely have been held for years. Press conferences
will he held at the
</P>
<P>
   Olympic Museum a few miles away.
</P>
<P>
   An unusual air of gravity has fallen over IOC headquarters,
which have been besieged by press inquiries from around the world.
Olympic insiders place the Salt Lake City bidding scandal among the
most difficult and potentially damaging episodes in Olympic history
alongside the U.S. boycott of the 1980 Moscow Games and the
drug-related expulsion of Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson from the
1988 Seoul Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Dick Pound the other day, and I got the strong
sense that he thought this was easily the gravest crisis he's
encountered,'' said Sir Bob Scott, the chief of Manchester's
unsuccessful bids for the 1996 and 2000 Games.
</P>
<P>
   Scott believes that such a highly publicized scandal is also
deeply disturbing to IOC
</P>
<P>
   President Juan Antonio Samaranch, who led the Games from near
bankruptcy in 1980 to its standing now as multi-billion dollar
industry. Samaranch, 78, has said he
</P>
<P>
   will retire in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hates this,'' Scott said. ``He knows that the real
marketing motif of the IOC is whiteness and purity, as it were. The
moment that gets sullied, that's when the Olympics lose value, and
that's when the real trouble starts. That's his great worry.''
</P>
<P>
   The format of the proceedings Saturday and Sunday is not being
disclosed, said Philip Furrer, an IOC spokesman. Even though it has
been widely reported that as many
</P>
<P>
   as 16 members have been accused of questionable behavior, the
IOC will not confirm
</P>
<P>
   the number.
</P>
<P>
   All those implicated have responded to letters written by
Samaranch outlining the allegations. One member of the IOC has
resigned, while several other IOC members have disputed the
allegations in writing. Pound's four-member commission reviewed
their responses Wednesday in New York.
</P>
<P>
   An undisclosed number have indicated they will appear before the
executive board in person.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some but not all will come,'' said Furrer, who expects that
they probably will
</P>
<P>
   complete their defenses and explanations on Saturday. The
executive board will meet
</P>
<P>
   again Sunday morning and then release the results of the
month-long investigation in the early evening.
</P>
<P>
   The accused members can resign or face expulsion by the full
114-member IOC,
</P>
<P>
   which has been called back to Lausanne in March for a special
session to deal with the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   A two-thirds vote of that session is required for expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the damage to its image, the IOC is deeply
concerned about the prospect of getting caught up in the U.S.
criminal investigation. ``We will have to
</P>
<P>
   consider what the position of the IOC will be if we are served
with a subpoena to appear in front of a grand jury,'' said a draft
report of Pound's report obtained by The Wall Street Journal.
``This is a particularly odious procedural part of criminal law in
which the accused virtually have no rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound's 24-page draft report alleged the IOC members accepted
more than $780,000 in payments and gifts from Salt Lake City
Olympic officials, the newspaper reported. Pound, a Montreal lawyer
and former Olympic swimmer, has said that the instances of
corruption engaged in by some IOC members are serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see it in black and white, it's pretty blatant stuff,
so I don't think the people involved are going to be able to
explain it away,'' Pound told a Toronto newspaper Wednesday. ``But
we'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen IOC members have been implicated publicly in the
corruption scandal. They are from Ecuador, Libya, Sudan, Finland,
Congo Republic, the Netherlands, Ivory Coast, Mali, South Korea,
Kenya, Chile, Swaziland and Russia. The Finnish member, Pirjo
Haeggman, resigned Tuesday.

   The IOC investigation is one of five looking into allegations of
wrongdoing connected with Salt Lake City's Olympics bid. The
Justice Department, the U.S. Olympic Committee, the Salt Lake
organizing committee and the Utah attorney general are conducting
separate inquiries.

UNCORKING ELGAR'S ESSENCE
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Americans march to Elgar at commencements as they
march to Mendelssohn at weddings, but they probably don't think
about him most of the rest of the year. To a nation with little
patience for quaint remnants, he can seem an anomalous holdover of
the British Empire, which much of his music appeared to embody in
its doughty staunchness and solemnity.
</P>
<P>
   But Elgar deserves respect for more than just those ``Pomp and
Circumstance'' marches; some listeners have found a core of deep
humanity in his work, even under the occasional bluster. And now,
for no reason apparent in the stars, a confluence of events has
brought the composer to attention.
</P>
<P>
   His unfinished Third Symphony, as elaborated by Anthony Payne,
had its American premiere recently in Philadelphia and comes to New
York at Carnegie Hall in March, compliments of the National
Symphony. His masterly Cello Concerto looms large in the new film
``Hilary and Jackie,'' a gloss on the life of the great cellist
Jacqueline du Pre, though even if that were a truer and more
compelling depiction of du Pre, it would probably not bring the
momentary popularity to this autumnal concerto that ``Shine'' did
to the ``Rach 3.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, beginning Sunday, Sir Colin Davis and the London
Symphony present Elgar at Avery Fisher Hall in company with
Beethoven, no less, as part of the Lincoln Center festival ``The
Glory of Britain: Sir Edward Elgar.'' The Cello Concerto will be
performed, along with the First Symphony, the ``Enigma'' Variations
and other works, but rights for the New York premiere of that Third
Symphony had already been claimed by the National Symphony before
this festival came into being.
</P>
<P>
   The classical music critics of The New York Times are therefore
casting their own glance back at Elgar by way of records, choosing
favorites among CDs currently available (or in a few cases, not).
At the least, these CDs should make for more appreciative listening
come graduation day.
</P>
<P>
   _ JAMES R. OESTREICH
</P>
<P>
   Here are some favorite Elgar recordings of the classical music
critics of The New York Times. CDs range in price from $16.99 for a
single CD to $32 for a specially priced four-CD set.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Holland:
</P>
<P>
   SYMPHONY NO. 1, `SEA PICTURES,' Halle Orchestra, conducted by
John Barbirolli; Kerstin Meyer, mezzo-soprano (Intaglio INCD
701-1). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `ENIGMA' VARIATIONS, `FALSTAFF,' `GRANIA AND DIARMID' EXCERPTS,
City of Birmingham Symphony, conducted by Simon Rattle (EMI
Classics CDC 55001).
</P>
<P>
   What separated Edward Elgar from the 20th century, even though
he lived in it, was less a matter of harmony or metric complication
than one of time. Elgar's music has a lot of it: all day, if need
be. The First Symphony unfolds like a slow ceremonial march; the
Violin Concerto dawdles agreeably. The dotted rhythm that marks the
opening movement of the Cello Concerto explores every variant and
transmutation of its nature. This is music that refuses either to
be hurried or to be deprived of saying everything on its mind.
</P>
<P>
   In the handful of Elgar recordings that have come my way, I have
looked for performances that similarly don't respond to pressure.
Patriotic identification is often a good idea in Elgar, too. Fervor
aside, the British still feel kinship with the kind of rolling,
easygoing calmness Elgar transmits so well, even if their lives no
longer allow it. No music is farther from the jet age than his.
</P>
<P>
   My predilections will not please the high-fidelity enthusiast.
In fact, several of my favorite recordings are out of print and
await resurrection. There is _ or used to be _ Yehudi Menuhin
playing the Violin Concerto with the New Philharmonia Orchestra and
Adrian Boult at a 1965 concert in London, from EMI Classics;
Menuhin's fineness of spirit is intact and his technique in better
than usual shape for that era. I also like Steven Isserlis playing
the Cello Concerto in a 10-year-old recording from Virgin Classics,
with Richard Hickox conducting the London Symphony. Note that the
same soloist and orchestra are to play the piece Saturday at the
New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark and on Sunday at Avery
Fisher Hall, with Colin Davis conducting.
</P>
<P>
   From the ranks of the living CDs, the First Symphony feels
comfortable in the hands of John Barbirolli, conducting his old
Halle Orchestra almost 30 years ago. Taken from a concert, the
Intaglio release also includes the slightly wavering Kerstin Meyer
singing Elgar's ``Sea Pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   More up to date in terms of engineering and certainly in firm
British hands are the familiar ``Enigma'' Variations, the
incidental music from ``Grania and Diarmid'' and the symphonic
study ``Falstaff.'' Simon Rattle conducts the City of Birmingham
Symphony Orchestra. And if your taste for Edwardian choral
extravaganzas is strong, you may still find Rattle and the same
orchestra performing ``The Dream of Gerontius'' on another deleted
EMI disk; Janet Baker, John Mitchinson and John Shirley-Quirk sing
the solos.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Kozinn:
</P>
<P>
   STRING QUARTET, Brodsky Quartet (ASV DCA 526; with Delius'
String Quartet). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PIANO QUINTET, Coull String Quartet; Allan Schiller, pianist
(ASV DCA 678; with Bridge's Piano Quintet). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `A PORTRAIT OF ELGAR,' English String Orchestra, conducted by
William Boughton (Nimbus 1769; four CDs). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLIN CONCERTO, Kennedy, violinist; City of Birmingham
Symphony, conducted by Simon Rattle (EMI Classics CDC 56413; with
Vaughan Williams' ``Lark Ascending''). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Elgar's String Quartet and Piano Quintet deserve to be heard
more frequently. Composed in 1918, they touch a deeply emotional
core: the anxieties of wartime are palpable in both, though in
different ways.
</P>
<P>
   The quartet proceeds with dignified formality, but its calm
opening chord progression becomes a foreboding welter of notes
before the opening phrase is finished. Even then, the anguish that
drives the work is kept under the surface until halfway through the
first movement; from there on, the listener is drawn under Elgar's
storm cloud. The Brodsky Quartet's reading is incisive and
hard-driven, but also warm in tone and spirit.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Similar qualities, as well as an appealing nimbleness and
coloristic flexibility, inform a recording of the Piano Quintet by
the Coull String Quartet and Allan Schiller. This is a more complex
work than the quartet. It waxes nostalgic in its first movement
with a melodious string theme that would not be out of place in an
English tearoom on a carefree, sunny afternoon. But that theme is
countered by darker, more wistful currents, which take center stage
in the Adagio and explode in the finale with a ferocity unusual for
Elgar.
</P>
<P>
   William Boughton has made a specialty of early 20th-century
British music, and his recordings with the English String Orchestra
and the English Symphony have a winning Romantic sumptuousness,
which is magnified by the natural reverberance of the halls where
they are recorded. Boughton has recorded Elgar plentifully, and his
efforts have been efficiently compiled in a midprice box, ``A
Portrait of Elgar.''
</P>
<P>
   Of particular interest are Boughton's accounts of the popular
Introduction and Allegro and the Serenade, which offer purely
hedonistic pleasures for anyone who enjoys cranking up the stereo
system and bathing in lush string textures. But other treats are an
irresistibly robust ``Cockaigne,'' a supple reading of the
``Enigma'' Variations, a perfectly blustery set of ``Pomp and
Circumstance'' marches and a handful of alluring oddities, like the
Tchaikovskian ``Wand of Youth'' Suite No. 2 and the folkish
Bavarian Dances.
</P>
<P>
   Say what you like about Kennedy's stage antics, hairstyle or
sartorial sense; he plays Elgar's Violin Concerto spectacularly. In
collaboration with Simon Rattle and the City of Birmingham
Symphony, he gives a thoughtfully shaped account full of gorgeous
touches. Not least among these is his unabashed use of portamento
when the phrase demands it, and the luminous tone he lavishes on
the Andante.
</P>
<P>
   James R. Oestreich:
</P>
<P>
   CELLO CONCERTO, `SEA PICTURES,' Jacqueline du Pre, cellist;
Janet Baker, mezzo-soprano; London Symphony, conducted by John
Barbirolli (EMI Classics CDC 56219). &QL;

SERENADE, BBC Symphony, conducted by Andrew Davis (Teldec
9031-73279-2). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `THE MUSIC MAKERS,' Janet Baker, mezzo-soprano; London
Philharmonic Choir and Orchestra; `THE DREAM OF GERONTIUS,' Helen
Watts, contralto; Nicolai Gedda, tenor; Robert Lloyd, bass; John
Alldis Choir and London Philharmonic Choir; New Philharmonia
Orchestra; conducted by Adrian Boult (EMI Classics ZDMB 66540; two
CDs; imported by Tower Records). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SYMPHONY NO. 3 (ELABORATED BY ANTHONY PAYNE), BBC Symphony,
conducted by Andrew Davis (NMC 053). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Availability is sporadic when it comes to the classic versions
of Elgar. His own recordings, though reissued just a half-dozen
years ago by EMI (the electrical recordings) and Pearl (the
acousticals), seem to have already dropped out of the American
catalog. And the recordings led by such persuasive maestros as
Adrian Boult, Malcolm Sargent and John Barbirolli are often
available only by special import if at all. Despite the fine
qualities of a later generation of British interpreters, these
figures may have caught more of the deep feeling of Elgar's music,
generally without giving uncomfortable sway to sentimentality.
</P>
<P>
   Some of their work is readily available. No Elgarian needed the
film ``Hilary and Jackie'' to be reminded of the special qualities
Jacqueline du Pre brought to the composer's Cello Concerto. The
classic interpretation is the one led by Barbirolli, from 1965, in
which du Pre plugs into a wisdom and world-weariness that belie her
two decades. But there is also much to be said for the more
youthful impetuousness of a performance with Sargent and the BBC
Symphony, recorded live in 1963, on Intaglio.
</P>
<P>
   The Barbirolli disk offers the bonus of another English
performer of exquisite sensibility too little remembered, the
mezzo-soprano Janet Baker in the meditative ``Sea Pictures.'' Until
you have heard Ms. Baker sing a lullaby, as in the opening ``Sea
Slumber Song,'' you haven't heard a lullaby.
</P>
<P>
   Barbirolli is heard again to excellent effect in the First
Symphony, this time in a 1962 recording available only by import.
The maestro finds full measures of majesty and excitement in this
work while keeping a fine grip on the structural flow. And again,
there is a bonus: I had forgotten how much I liked the overture
``Cockaigne,'' after so many workaday performances, until I
returned to the version here, which is rivetingly fresh and
sprightly.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Elgar I treasure most, the ``Enigma'' Variations, I
find myself without a particular favorite recording available. I
remember being impressed some years ago by Andre Previn's version
with the Royal Philharmonic on Philips, but I don't have it, and
haven't been able to turn it up in record stores. So here is a good
solid account of the work, from 1991 by Davis, along with another
``Cockaigne'' and other indispensable Elgar.
</P>
<P>
   The composer quotes both the ``Enigma'' Variations and the First
Symphony in his lovely ode ``The Music Makers.'' For this listener,
that work, the smaller one, is the main event in a fine pairing of
Boult performances, and the sprawling ``Dream of Gerontius'' is the
bonus. The 1966 recording of ``The Music Makers'' has, again, the
inestimable asset of Ms. Baker. The ``Dream of Gerontius''
recording, with Nicolai Gedda sounding thin and quavery at times,
is from 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Payne's elaboration of sketches for the Third Symphony,
heavy with repetitive melodic sequences, cannot be reckoned a
success in giving the world another Elgar masterwork, but it
affords interesting glimpses of the musical world Elgar saw around
and ahead of him shortly before his death in 1934.

<P>
   It has been terribly hard for Elgar to shake off his reputation
as a fusty composer of ceremonial marches for occasions of British
pomp and pageantry. Even a champion like Colin Davis concedes that
Elgar had an excessive fondness for ``the grand gesture, great,
big, surging and full of noise.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Elgar was a skillful master who brought classical procedures
into the 20th century, and he possessed a wistful, elegiac and
affectingly personal voice. The surprisingly comprehensive Elgar
discography should help change perceptions.
</P>
<P>
   One record that makes the case for Elgar is the recent Testament
reissue of the sprawling, utterly original Violin Concerto, with
Adrian Boult, a colleague of the composer who attended the work's
1910 premiere, conducting the London Philharmonic Orchestra, and
Ida Haendel, a great British violinist of Polish birth, who was 53
when this recording was made in 1977. The piece is ruggedly
virtuosic and musically intricate, a curious and haunting
combination. The thematic writing is boldly asymmetrical; melodic
lines often evolve in a series of short, abrupt phrases, a quality
that has rendered Elgar open to the charge of being short-winded.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Haendel's assured performance forges these clipped
phrases into long, riveting arcs of music. She was admired for her
resourceful technique, inspired musicianship and intelligence. She
didn't go in for attention-grabbing display and emotive
expressivity, partly the reason, perhaps, that she never attained
great popularity. But she was an ideal interpreter of this work,
and Boult, who was 88 at the time, brings deep sensitivity and the
insight of a noted Elgar advocate.
</P>
<P>
   For another Elgar surprise, you cannot do better than a recent
Hyperion disk of choral songs performed by the London Symphony
Chorus, directed by Vernon Handley. Elgar was richly literate, and
he set texts with a sense of service to the words. The choral
writing is beautiful in a serenely understated way, and the
performances are winning.
</P>
<P>
   There are many fine recordings of the ingenious ``Enigma''
Variations for orchestra. Simon Rattle's with the City of
Birmingham Symphony perhaps best conveys a sense of impish fun in
the music that is often missed. Yes, this is a complex, even
cerebral orchestral work. But Elgar is playing a game here as well,
not just in casting the variations as secret portraits of friends
and colleagues, but also by manipulating the thematic materials in
elusive and mischievous ways. Rattle captures these qualities, and
the recording offers fine performances of two other orchestral
works: the symphonic study ``Falstaff'' and incidental music for
``Grania and Diarmid.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the much-teased ``Pomp and Circumstance'' marches are
effective and beguiling. Try Andre Previn's genial performances of
all five with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in a splendid
two-for-the-price-of-one Philips set, which also includes the First
and Second Symphonies.

   Elgar _ who was a fuddy-duddy only on the outside, which was all
most photographers could capture _ took enthusiastically to
recording and, during the last decade or so of his life, conducted
most of his orchestral works for the new medium. When these
recordings were reissued by EMI 30 years ago, they came as a
revelation. Maybe their snappish gestures and quick tempos were
conditioned partly by the composer's need to get as much as
possible onto each 78-rpm side, but they sounded right. And they
sounded refreshingly different from what was coming out of the
British Elgar tradition.
</P>
<P>
   The CD transfers of Elgar's Elgar, though seemingly deleted from
the catalog in the United States, remain available. There are also
other recordings to show the vigor with which Elgar's music was
done when it was new, including his performances from the era
before microphones (on Pearl), which because of their often
extremely truncated scores and poor sound, will appeal only to the
Elgar enthusiast.
</P>
<P>
   Elgar's recordings are not so important now because their
lessons have been learned, especially by the latest generation of
British conductors, who seem to have listened to them hard and
well.
</P>
<P>
   Simon Rattle and Kennedy give a discrete period feel to the
Violin Concerto in their malleable tempos and touches of
portamento, but their goal is not so much historical accuracy as
making the music speak urgently at every moment with character and
brio, and to let the broader drive come out of the urgency.
Kennedy's virtuosity is breathtaking, especially in the runs of the
first movement, where every little note is securely placed. And the
interplay with, and within, the orchestra is remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Davis is another great advocate of this music, remembered
here for the powerful ``Enigma'' Variations he gave with the New
York Philharmonic in 1996. His recordings include a glorious
account of one of Elgar's most glorious works, ``In the South,'' a
symphonic poem of energy and elation, recalling an Italian holiday
that took the composer away from duty and the melancholy it
imparted. This two-for-the-price-of-one set also includes both
symphonies and three ``Pomp and Circumstance'' marches, but it is
hard to stop playing ``In the South'' again and again.

POPE FACES JUBILANT WELCOME IN MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSANA HAYWARD  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ When Pope John Paul II arrives Friday in this
lively, overcrowded and smoggy capital, he will receive a jubilant
welcome few world figures could muster.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of people are expected to line the streets to greet the
ailing pontiff, 78, as he lands at the Benito Juarez International
Airport for a four-day visit.
</P>
<P>
   It will likely be his last trip to Mexico, a country he has
visited three previous times and proudly pronounced ``always
faithful.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``faithful'' credo, however, has not been easy or peaceful
to come by, even though the majority of the nation's 97.5 million
people are Roman Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   From the time Hernan Cortes and his Spanish army conquered the
Aztec empire more than 500 years ago, Mexicans and particularly
their government have had a complicated relationship with the
Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of Mexico's greatest dichotomies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seen historically, even in the best moments of this century,
relations have not been very cordial, but rather confrontational,''
said Jose Legorreta, a scholar who teaches religion at the
Universidad Iberoamericana of Mexico City, a prominent Jesuit
university.
</P>
<P>
   After Mexico won its independence from Spain in 1821, the
government and church battled for power. But the church lost the
struggle following the 1857 constitution that stripped its
authority.
</P>
<P>
   Relations grew even worse following the 1910-1917 Mexican
Revolution when the church was nationalized and priests were not
allowed any public role, including the right to vote and own
property.
</P>
<P>
   The policies unleashed a bloody repression in the late 1920s,
when church services were banned and peasants took up arms in
protest.
</P>
<P>
   State-church relations continue uneasy to this day, highlighted
mostly by a dormant Indian guerrilla rebellion in the southern
state of Chiapas, where the government has expelled seven priests
and jailed four others accused of fomenting unrest and meddling in
state affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The pope will indeed find a different Mexico than the one of
1993, his last visit.
</P>
<P>
   Only a year earlier the government had restored formal
diplomatic relationships with the Vatican after more than a
century.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1994, the hope brought on by closer ties began
diminishing with the simultaneous arrival of the North American
Free Trade Agreement and the Zapatista Indian rebels, whose main
defender is the leftist and outspoken Bishop Samuel Ruiz of San
Cristobal de las Casas. Many, including those in the government,
want to get rid of Ruiz, who has not only been the subject of
verbal attacks but also was the target of a murder attempt. He now
travels with bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't understand why the Church of Rome ignores our
petition to substitute (Ruiz) with someone who teaches the true
Catholic doctrine,'' reads a letter a group of Chiapas landowners
wants to give to the pope.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Manuel Olimon Nolasco, a religious historian at the
Pontifical University of Mexico City, said the issue is not Ruiz
but rather hazy government policies that don't deal head on with
the demands of Zapatistas: democracy, help to reduce poverty and
malnutrition, and the lack of education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pope is not coming here to get rid of Samuel Ruiz,''
Olimon said in an interview. ``The government and certain
intellectuals think they can demonize one person and one attitude
... The United States had communism and now Saddam Hussein. The
same occurs here with Samuel Ruiz.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the controversial bishop, many sectors here, including
the church, also decry economic policies in an age of free trade.
The pope himself has counseled against enriching the affluent at
the expense of the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different Mexico, more wounded, than when the pope was
last here,'' Olimon said. ``When there is a crisis, there is a
deterioration to our dignity. We have an indebted country with a
negative image: we don't progress; we don't advance.''
</P>
<P>
   Foremost on the papal agenda, however, is the future of
Catholicism in the Americas. Mexico is seen as the geographical
epicenter of the Western Hemisphere, the country with the second
largest Catholic population after Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   It was chosen as the place to respond to the Synod of Bishops of
America, held in December 1997 to address the advance of
Protestantism and evangelism in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church, the Catholic faith, feels extremely threatened by
consumerism evangelism, a series of issues,'' Legorreta said. ``It
is important to come here because this is the trampoline to speak
to the rest of Latin America.''

   DETROIT _ Auto shows were once time machines that propelled
visitors into a utopian future where cars might fly _ or at least
they looked as if they could. But at today's big shows, the clock
runs backward. A stroll through manufacturers' glitzy displays,
like those at the North American auto show that ended here this
week, is often a trip down memory lane.
</P>
<P>
   Look there _ it's a two-seat Thunderbird with porthole windows!
The shape of that sporty wagon looks both new and familiar; it's a
'55 Chevy Nomad redone for the 21st century. Did you see the new
Chevrolet Impala, back again with that famous row of round
taillights? How about the design studies for updated muscle cars
like the Dodge Charger R/T and the Pontiac GTO? Doesn't the
Chrysler PT Cruiser look as if it careered out of a gangster movie,
Jimmy Cagney at the wheel, tommy guns blazing?
</P>
<P>
   But these are flashbacks with a twist, because the cars are
thoroughly modern under the skin. The Charger has the Coke-bottle
profile popular with muscle cars of the '60s, but this idea car is
powered by clean-burning natural gas. The Nomad still has Chevy's
venerable small-block V8 engine, which dates to 1955, but it is now
a trendy melding of sports car, station wagon, sport utility and
minivan, with a roof that opens like a Venetian blind.
</P>
<P>
   After two decades of generally bland design, carmakers are
refocusing on styling as a way to set their vehicles apart and to
establish stronger brand images in the minds of consumers, and they
are reaching into their archives for their latest magic tricks.
This back-to-the-future movement is not for lack of new ideas;
indeed, many experts say that auto design is now better than it has
been in decades. Rather, the industry is belatedly jumping into a
nostalgic parade that has sent ripples through everything from
greeting cards to martinis to shapely old-style Coke bottles.
</P>
<P>
   The movement has manifested itself in architecture since the
1970s with postmodern designs like Charles Moore's Piazza d'Italia
in New Orleans. In the '80s, Philip Johnson and John Burgee built
PPG Place in Pittsburgh as a Gothic tower of glass.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers put on bell-bottoms and platform shoes. Now,
jive-daddy club-hoppers don fedoras and wide-lapeled suits to dance
to the neo-swing of the Squirrel Nut Zippers. Hollywood remade
``Psycho'' and turned ``The Shop Around the Corner'' into ``You've
Got Mail'' for the Internet generation.
</P>
<P>
   Sociologists say that as the countdown to the millennium
progresses, the uncertainties of the looming century have left
Americans yearning for a more idyllic time. The feeling is
particularly acute for aging baby boomers, many of them grappling
with middle-age anxieties. In such a climate, no wonder the
Volkswagen New Beetle, with its toy-car profile and built-in bud
vase, has been an unqualified hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for touchstones to grab onto that reach back to
our comfort zones,'' said John Herlitz, vice president for product
design at DaimlerChrysler. ``Retro design provides a comfort factor
that is just not there in the technology age.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Olsen, section chairman of the transportation design
department at the Center for Creative Studies in Detroit, where
many future designers are trained, called the trend ``a reaction to
some of the sterility of the last decade, particularly from the
Japanese manufacturers who have dominated the car market but offer
no individual identity in their cars.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, the Mazda Miata helped to ignite the retro
explosion. Its simple shape recalled 1950s British sports cars.
Likewise, nearly a decade later, the Porsche Boxster conjured up
the 1950s Speedster.
</P>
<P>
   Instrument gauges encircled by chrome bezels appeared on the
Mercedes-Benz SLK and Chrysler 300M. Two of this year's design
studies go further: Large, round '50s-style gauges are tucked
beneath eyebrows in the Ford Thunderbird and Mercedes-Benz Vision
SLR. The very modern ``(my) Mercury'' concept and the Toyota Echo,
both aimed at the young, even have gauges in the middle of the
dash, like cars of the '20s.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wrong with retro per se,'' said J. Mays, vice
president for design at Ford Motor Co. ``People buy retro clothes,
retro furniture, retro homes, retro food, retro music.'' Mays
supervised the design of the new Thunderbird, which was unveiled
here this month; his previous work included the 1994 Volkswagen
design study that eventually reached market as the New Beetle. Like
many other designers, Mays insists that the evocative new style is
not retro at all. He prefers to call it ``heritage design.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the Thunderbird concept, which is likely to be
quite similar to the 2001 production car, is a rear-drive,
V8-powered two-seater like the originals. And while it hints at
their style, it isn't a copy. ``It has the essence of the original
without actually relying on old-fashioned design cues,'' Mays said.
``We're trying to give people the car they looked at and dreamt
about as children. It's that transparent and that simple.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At General Motors, Wayne Cherry, vice president for design,
insists that design is retro only if it is an exact reproduction;
it is not retro, he says, if the design simply evokes the original
while adding a modern twist. Cherry uses the example of a
penguin-shaped cocktail shaker, a precise reproduction of the 1930s
original, that he saw at Restoration Hardware, a chain selling
nostalgic furniture and knickknacks.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, in Cherry's view, the Chevy Nomad unveiled at the show
here is not retro, though its shape and stance are clearly
reminiscent of the Nomads of 1955-57. But it also is futuristic in
that it represents a new generation of so-called crossover vehicles
that defy categorization. Straddling the two worlds is simply good
design, Cherry said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good design if you know product and recognize it as the
Chevy Nomad, or, if you are not familiar, you say that's a cool
vehicle that's fresh and contemporary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At DaimlerChrysler, consumer research elicited similar reactions
to the PT Cruiser, a sort of avant-garde minivan that will go on
sale in about a year. While older people see a profile unabashedly
copied from the 1937 Ford or from London taxicabs of the '30s, the
target group of young buyers see a design that is cool and
futuristic.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler makes no apologies for borrowing from the past.
``It's absolutely retro, and proudly so,'' Herlitz said. ``It's
futuristic and retro at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Hill, chairman of the transportation design department at
the Art Center College of Design, says the 20-something students at
the renowned school in Pasadena, Calif., see retro design as
something new. ``They view this as something fresh,'' Hill said.
``They've never done this or seen this before. They are excited
about rediscovering this kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason _ aging baby boomers yearning for the past
or automakers trying to pique the interest of boomers' children _
everything old really is new again. Or, as Hill pointed out, ``The
car business is a fashion business, after all.''

KEY GOP LAWMAKER ENDORSES PART OF CLINTON SOCIAL SECURITY PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN and JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A key Republican House chairman said Thursday that
GOP lawmakers will back President Bill Clinton's proposal to
channel 62 percent of the projected federal budget surplus into
shoring up Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe I can speak for the Republican majority in saying we
accept the president's offer _ save 62 percent _ until we've saved
Social Security,'' said Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer,
R-Texas, at the first of what will be many congressional hearings
on Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   His statement appeared to eliminate one potentially huge battle
over how the budgetary windfall should be spent. Archer's view is
crucial because his committee will get first crack at any proposed
Social Security legislation and is likely to end up writing its own
version.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan Clinton unveiled Tuesday in his State of the
Union address, 62 percent _ about $2.7 trillion _ of the $4.4
trillion surplus over the next 15 years would be used to bolster
the Social Security trust fund. The fund's actuaries have said that
if nothing is done, it will not be able to pay full benefits in
2032 as the 76-million strong ``baby boom'' generation is hitting
its peak retirement period.
</P>
<P>
   Adding the surplus would extend the fund's life until 2055,
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He also proposed taking about $700 billion of the surplus over
the 15 years and investing it in the stock market, which officials
believe would provide a higher rate of return than the government
securities that Social Security funds currently are invested in.
Also, Clinton proposed creating government-subsidized savings
accounts for middle- and working-class taxpayers modeled on 401(k)
accounts now common among private employers.
</P>
<P>
   While Archer endorsed the surplus proposal, he balked at the
idea of government investing on Wall Street. ``Do we invest in
tobacco companies?'' he asked. In the past, several Republican
lawmakers have called for privatizing Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers opposed to Clinton's investment strategy received a
boost Wednesday when Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan voiced
strong criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Until last week many Republicans, including Senate Budget
Committee Chairman Pete Domenici of New Mexico, favored using most
of the budget surplus for tax cuts. But Republican insistence on
tax cuts alone seemed muted Wednesday when Domenici said the
remaining portion of the surplus could be used to fund tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   At the Ways and Means hearing Thursday, Rep. Charles Rangel of
New York, the committee's senior Democrat, sounded a note of
optimism that despite partisan differences over Social Security,
compromise this year appeared possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on the brink of bringing together Republicans and
Democrats to agree on a bill to shore up Social Security,'' Rangel
said. ``The only thing to decide is the method to do it, and not if
we should do it.''
</P>
<P>
   During the hearing civil rights activist Jesse Jackson and Jack
Kemp, housing and urban development secretary in the Bush
administration, offered differing views on fixing Social Security
although they both agreed that investing in the stock market might
not be a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said it was important to ensure that all retirees be
guaranteed benefits and warned that private, individual accounts
offer no guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   Kemp wondered if the government would be able to justify
investing in companies, such as Microsoft, that are currently being
sued by the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Kemp offered a plan to fix Social Security that would allow
workers to establish personal retirement accounts using 3 percent
of the 12.4 percent payroll tax that individuals and employers
currently pay to fund the retirement system. Kemp also said that a
portion of the system must be maintained to guarantee the same
level of benefits to current retirees and people about to retire.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on Capitol Hill, 52 House members, mostly Democrats,
warned that Clinton's Social Security plan ``opens the doors to
privatizers,'' as Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, put it.
</P>
<P>
   Kucinich said that while Social Security has long-term
structural problems that must be fixed, the perception of its being
in ``crisis'' has been generated by corporate and financial
interests that would benefit from Social Security funds invested in
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the president does not propose privatizing Social
Security, it is my belief that what's being created (is) an opening
and a vehicle for privatizers to radically dismantle Social
Security,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers sent Clinton a letter saying that Social Security
should not be viewed as an ``investment'' policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should ... be considered as an insurance policy _
protecting us from poverty in old age, from the economic risks
associated with disability, or from the loss of a spouse or a
parent,'' the House group said. ``We do not want to ever see the
day return ... where the elderly were the poorest segment of our
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., introduced a bill that
would repeal a cap that currently reduces benefits for Social
Security recipients between 62 and 69 years old who work after they
retire.
</P>
<P>
   People between 62 to 64 lose $1 in Social Security benefits for
every $2 they earn above $9,600 and people age 65 to 69 lose $1 in
benefits for every $3 earned above $15,500. People 70 and older do
not lose any Social Security benefits if they work.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said many seniors work because they need to supplement
their Social Security checks and should not be penalized.

<P>
   A national poll of 804 people sponsored in part by Third
Millennium, a New York-based Social Security advocacy group, found
half of those interviewed believe a Super Bowl bet will generate a
higher rate of return than Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   The poll showed that 65 percent of respondents between 18 and 34
years old believe a professional wrestler has a greater chance of
being elected president than they do of receiving all the
retirement dollars they are entitled to.
</P>
<P>
   ``A majority of young adults believe they will outlive the
Social Security system,'' said Third Millennium executive director
Richard Thau after the latest poll findings. ``Is there any wonder
they fear a retirement crisis?'' Third Millennium claims to speak
for members of ``Generation X,'' who were born between 1965 and
1980.

ON THIS VISIT TO MEXICO, THE POPE IS BATTLING CAPITALISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ When Pope John Paul II held a recent working lunch to
prepare for his visit to Mexico, which begins on Friday, one
Vatican official present said that the 78-year-old pope spoke with
deep nostalgia about his first papal trip there 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This is not surprising. This is John Paul's fourth visit to
Mexico, but that first voyage in January 1979 was a rare moment in
history: a youthful-looking, untested pope was greeted by millions
of Roman Catholics with an outpouring of hope and excitement even
the Vatican had not expected.
</P>
<P>
   And that trip, in which he spoke out sternly against the leftist
liberation theology then polarizing the Roman Catholic Church in
Latin America, unveiled the Polish-born pope's unwavering stance
against communism of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   As he returns to prepare the Americas for the third millennium,
the pope finds himself once again battling an ideology that he
feels oppresses much of humanity, only this time it is capitalism,
which he says must work for a more equitable sharing of wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The human race is facing forms of slavery which are new and
more subtle than those of the past,'' the pope warned last month in
an apostolic letter. ``And for far too many people, freedom remains
a word without meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the world has changed since that ground-breaking first
trip. Communism has all but collapsed across the globe.
Revolutionary liberation theology is almost, if not quite, extinct.
The Mexican constitution was then so fiercely anti-clerical that
priests were banned from wearing collars in public. The Mexican
government changed its laws to allow religious freedom in 1991 and
opened diplomatic relations with the Vatican the following year.
</P>
<P>
   The pope himself is also strikingly different: Then vigorous and
bursting with health, John Paul II is now frail, stooped and shaky
with the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   One thing has not changed: In what has proved the bane of the
twilight years of his papacy, the problems of Third World poverty
that he so boldly emphasized in Mexico two decades ago, have not
improved.
</P>
<P>
   His trips to Mexico City and St. Louis have a dual purpose: He
wants to re-energize Catholics and their bishops to pursue what he
calls the new evangelization, his desire to deepen the church's
relationship with its followers and also broaden it by seeking new
converts.
</P>
<P>
   But he also wants to rattle the conscience of the free market.
``International institutions, national governments and the centers
controlling the world economy must all undertake brave plans and
projects to ensure a more just sharing of the goods of the world,''
the pope said in an address on Tuesday. It is a theme he is certain
to repeat throughout his visit.
</P>
<P>
   Having watched the collapse of communism, the pope now wants a
new political system for the 21st century, where the free market is
reined in by humanitarian concerns. His frequent calls for Third
World debt relief and income redistribution are all part of a
larger vision of a better world order.
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   The pope has said the church cannot present a new economic model
for the world, but he offers the church's social teaching ``as an
indispensable and ideal orientation'' for governments to follow.
Some view his message as a kind of Christian liberation theology.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all the promises, suddenly nobody seems to care about
the poor anymore,'' said Rev. Lorenzo Albacete, a theology
professor at St. Joseph's seminary in Yonkers, who accompanied the
pope to Cuba last year. ``Neo-liberalism has made the poor
invisible, and the church down there is the only one, badly or not,
that is holding up their cause. In Latin America, it's not
liberation theology, but it may be post-liberation theology.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the pope is not visiting Mexico and the United
States. He goes to Mexico to to deliver an ``apostolic
exhortation,'' a reply to the bishops of North and South America,
who together held a synod in Rome in 1997, one of the largest
meetings of bishops since the ecumenical council Vatican II. To
address their concerns _ on matters including economic justice,
Third World debt, the shortage of priests and the growth of
evangelical Protestant movements, as well as abortion and the death
penalty _ the pope plans to spend four days in Mexico City, then
travel to St. Louis for a 36-hour visit.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican pointedly refers to the pope's trip as a visit to
America, lumping the two continents together. The wording is a
reflection of the Vatican's long and Eurocentric view of history
from the arrival of Christianity in the New World 500 years ago.
Addressing the synod, the pope asked the bishops to ``consider the
continent as a whole, from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego, without
introducing a separation between the north, the center or the
south, so as not to risk a contrast between them.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also a sign that the pope wants to ingrain in North
American Catholics a stronger sense of solidarity with their
brothers and sisters in the South. ``He wants to get North American
church out of its English-language bunker and start thinking of
itself as one Catholic Church in the Western hemisphere,'' George
Weigel, a Catholic theologian whose biography of John Paul II is
due to be published in October. ``And he wants Latin American
Catholics to think of themselves not as victims but as agents of
their own history.''
</P>
<P>
   And of their future. The pope has been planning how to usher in
the third millennium ever since he was elected. Disappointed by the
secularism and alienation that runs through Europe, he looks to the
more than 780 million Catholics of North and South America as the
main source of expansion in the third millennium. The pope's call
for a new Catholic evangelization, however, has been muted by
widespread indifference in rich countries and the spread of
evangelical Protestant churches in poor ones.
</P>
<P>
   When the pope addressed Mexican bishops during a visit in 1990,
he told them that they were partly to blame that the church was
losing ground to fundamentalist groups, saying they had left many
Mexicans ``deplorably vulnerable'' to proselytizing by Protestant
denominations.
</P>
<P>
   This was a leitmotif of the synod, where many Latin American
bishops complained about the ``invasion'' of Protestant sects,
whose financing mostly comes from North America. And that challenge
from Christian rivals is as vexing to the Vatican as the spread of
liberation theology was 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was at a bishops' conference in Puebla during his 1979 trip
that the pope warned against liberation theology. By the end of the
1980s, Marxist-leaning priests and bishops in Latin America had
been removed, and the movement lost much of its support among the
clergy. The inequities still rampant under the free market system
have raised the consciousness of many in the church hierarchy,
however. They may abhor the doctrine of liberation theology, but
church leaders in Mexico and throughout Latin American have adopted
some of the language.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Marxism fell, we thought everything would be resolved,
but instead, no,'' said Archbishop Javier Lozano Barragan of
Mexico, a Vatican official who attended the Puebla meeting. ``Now
we have a neo-liberalism on which the poor get poorer and the
hungry are marginalized. There has to be something besides the free
market.''
</P>
<P>
   But the pope is returning at a time when the role of the church
as a champion of the poor and oppressed in Mexico is being
challenged in Chiapas, a southern state in Mexico, where leftist
guerrillas are battling government forces. Catholic priests serving
Indian populations have come under attack by the government. Some,
like Bishop Samuel Ruiz, who until last year served as a mediator
in peace talks between the government and the rebels, are accused
by government officials of being supporters of the rebels. A group
of conservative activists and landowners in Chiapas sent a public
letter to the pope on Tuesday asking him to remove Ruiz.
</P>
<P>
   Some Vatican officials believe that Ruiz has gone too far.
Mexicans will be anxiously awaiting to hear whether the pope will
address the problem of Chiapas while visiting the country.
</P>
<P>
   While the pope is in St. Louis, many Americans will be riveted
by the pope's meeting with President Clinton. The Vatican, which
has studiously avoided any comment on the impeachment trial
clouding Clinton's presidency, views the visit as a courtesy call
from one head of state to another. ``They never asked, never
commented,'' said Lindy Boggs, the U.S. ambassador to the Holy See.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. news media are likely to give greater weight to the
iconography of a handshake between one of the world's most
respected moral leaders and a president who is on trial on charges
that he lied under oath about an extramarital affair.

ATTORNEY GENERAL TO TARGET ANTI-ABORTION VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LARA JAKES  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Marking the anniversary of the Roe vs. Wade
abortion decision, Attorney General Eliot Spitzer will announce
plans Friday to create a statewide reproductive rights legal unit
to combat violence targeting abortion clinics and their providers
and clients.
</P>
<P>
   But the state attorney general also needs to stand up for the
constitutional rights of others, one anti-abortion advocate said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by last fall's shooting of Buffalo abortion doctor
Barnett Slepian, Spitzer plans to have the unit up and running by
mid-April, when anti-abortion protesters are set to speak out in
western New York.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer is scheduled to announce his plans in front of state
chapter of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action
League, said his spokesman, Darren Dopp. Friday marks the 26th
anniversary of Roe vs. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court decision that
upheld abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   In creating the unit, Spitzer is keeping a campaign promise that
gave him a last-minute boost in his successful but razor-thin
victory over Republican incumbent Dennis Vacco in the November
election. The Vacco administration did not have a unit specifically
dealing with abortion issues.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to prosecuting those who threaten or harm abortion
providers, their staffs and clients, the unit also will advocate
for stronger clinic-access laws and investigate alleged
conspiracies against clinics and their workers. It also will
coordinate reproductive rights cases, said Andrew G. Celli Jr., the
chief of the attorney general's Civil Rights Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``This state has seen an increase in activity around health
centers that provide reproductive services, some of which is lawful
and some of which is not,'' Celli said. Spitzer ``views the issues
of reproductive rights going well beyond clinic access _ it has a
ripple effect in other areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer is one of the most vocal supporters of a clinic-access
bill that is expected to be approved by the state Assembly early
next week.
</P>
<P>
   That bill would expand protection of abortion providers by
making it a state-enforced criminal offense to block or intimidate
a person seeking entry into a clinic. It also seeks to clear the
way for civil lawsuits against those who harass or harm providers
and staff at their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-abortion advocates said Thursday they planned to pressure
lawmakers to block the bill in the name of the First Amendment. If
the bill passes, said Citizens Concerned for Human Life spokesman
Dennis Wolterding, law-abiding protesters may face ``frivolous
lawsuits'' that would be expensive to settle.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it protected free speech as much as it protects so-called
abortion rights, if it gave us the right to counter or the right to
ask the attorney general for guidance so we'd know we'd be in
compliance ... we might even be in favor of such legislation,''
Wolterding said as a dozen people peacefully picketed in front of
the Legislative Office Building. ``But that's not what's happening
here.''

 IN ISRAELI POLITICS, IT'S PARTY TIME 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A former model and successful cosmetics company
owner, Pnina Rosenblum is an Israeli sex symbol, tall, leggy,
blonde, glamorous and independent. She is also a new political
party.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the mad and volatile race to form the next government,
Ms. Rosenblum has gone beyond throwing her hat in the ring for a
seat in Parliament. She has founded a movement based on herself and
her ideas, and registered as a party.
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. Rosenblum is not alone. In what some see as a breakdown
of the Israeli political system and others herald as a fresh new
political dynamism, this election has become a free-for-all for
new, narrowly cast parties _ parties built on personalities, on
single issues, on ethnicity, on gender and on spiritual matters.
</P>
<P>
   Since the right-wing coalition government of Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu was dissolved in late December, more than a
dozen parties have entered the political game, which has
traditionally been dominated here by two parties: Labor on the left
and Likud on the right.
</P>
<P>
   Among the newest parties, there is one representing Russian
immigrants (the second such) and one representing Moroccans (the
third). A new Arab Union party joins two other Arab coalitions,
while the first Romanian party, whose platform includes a demand
for a Romanian-language cable television station, has emerged.
</P>
<P>
   There is a pro-gambling Casino Party, a pro-marijuana Green Leaf
and a pro-meditation Natural Law Party. There is a gray power
party, representing the elderly, and two new green power parties,
defending the environment. Ms. Rosenblum's party is one of a kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called it the Pnina Rosenblum party,'' said Ms. Rosenblum,
who is doing remarkably well in the polls, ``because every child
and every grown up in this country knows Pnina Rosenblum cosmetics
and Pnina Rosenblum pantyhose and Pnina Rosenblum herself. For 25
years, I have been the most famous girl in Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   The multiparty system is not new; it is the continuation of a
trend that began in the 1980s. But the power of the smaller parties
grew exponentially after the last elections, when, under an
electoral reform, Israelis were able for the first time to split
their vote _ casting one vote for prime minister and another for a
party slate for Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the two large parties grew smaller, and the small
parties grew larger, creating a particularly fractious Parliament
with 11 parties _ several of which developed the art of holding
national legislation hostage to their specific interests.
</P>
<P>
   In the next elections, the two major parties, which have been
undergoing identity crises, are expected to lose even more seats.
And political analysts have predicted that as many as 19 parties
will win a place in Parliament, creating a legislative body that is
even more unruly than the current one.
</P>
<P>
   ``What lies ahead is a potentially quite unstable situation,''
said Yaron Ezrahi, a political scientist and fellow of the Israel
Democracy Institute. ``Consensus will be still more difficult to
reach, and the collective spirit of the nation is likely to
fragment even further. Everyone will be out for himself.''
</P>
<P>
   To obtain a place in Parliament, a party must draw at least 1.5
percent of eligible voters, or about 65,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
   This does not seem insurmountable to those like Ezra Tisona, a
gambler whose new party seeks to push Israel to emulate the success
of the Palestinian Authority's casino in Jericho, or Avraham
Asoulin, whose Moroccan Party wants to obtain for former immigrants
from North Africa ``all the benefits that the Russians receive.''
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened by a sense that the political landscape is opening
up, the newest parties include several disaffected former members
of Labor and Likud. Two new right-wing parties have sprung up for
those who think that Likud has gone soft on the Palestinian issue.
</P>
<P>
   And a workers' party was registered Thursday, started by the
head of the Histadrut labor federation and aimed at those who
believe that Labor has become a leftist party representing only the
capitalist and intellectual elite.
</P>
<P>
   Labor itself, in fact, is hedging its bets. The Labor Party
leader, Ehud Barak, has registered his campaign, One Israel, as a
new party.
</P>
<P>
   And at least until they join forces, there are two new center
parties behind two candidates for prime minister, Amnon
Lipkin-Shahak, a former army chief of staff, and Dan Meridor, a
former Likud Party finance minister.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rosenblum, 44, is a phenomenon that no one is
underestimating. The daughter of an Iraqi immigrant, she grew up
very poor in a town outside Tel Aviv. After winning a beauty
contest at 17, she became Israel's best-known fashion model. At 25,
with a $10,000 loan from a friend from New Jersey, she started a
cosmetics line named after herself, which grew into a large
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I achieved this dream and gave much pride to women,'' she
said. ``People admired me because I grew up in a shack, and then I
built everything all by my hand. One time on TV, they asked me when
I'm going into politics. I said maybe the year 2,000. And the
people, they jumped on my remark. I got letters from all over the
country. They wanted a new face, someone who started from the
bottom and raised herself up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided to take the step,'' she continued. ``And I made my
own party because I'm very independent and by myself, I will have
more power.''

   IMPEACH-TRIAL (Washington) _ Developments as Clinton's team
finishes its third and final day of defense presentations. By R.W.
Apple Jr.
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-CLINTON (Washington) _ A White House memo: Bill Clinton

another campaign? By James Bennet.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-INTERVIEW-GERM (Washington) _ President Clinton
discusses germ-warfare issues in an interview. By Judith Miller and
William J. Broad.
</P>
<P>
   STATEOFUNION-PROMOTE (Undated) _ When President Clinton
announced in his State of the Union Address this week that he
wanted the federal government to press schools to end ``social
promotion,'' he was stepping into a longstanding, mine-laden
educational debate: When students fail, is it better to have them
repeat the school year or promote them to the next grade anyway? By
Ethan Bronner.

   POPE-MEXICO (Rome) _ Much has changed since the pope's
ground-breaking first trip to Mexico in 1979 when he spoke out
sternly against the Marxist- liberation theology then polarizing
the Roman Catholic church in Latin America. As he returns to
prepare the Americas for the third millennium, the pope finds
himself once again battling an ideology that he feels oppresses
much of humanity, only this time it is capitalism. By Alessandra
Stanley.

<TEXT>
<P>
   GUANGZHOU, China _ People boarding the Sunday morning train from
Hong Kong to this southern Chinese city on Jan. 10 were treated to
a novel sight: Dozens of Western bankers in suits sat among the
Chinese travelers, their briefcases stashed between lumpy bags of
food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
   The pin-striped passengers were in a chatty mood. They were
about to learn the fate of one of China's largest state-owned
companies, Guangdong International Trust and Investment Corp., or
Gitic. Though Gitic was in danger of defaulting on nearly $1.5
billion in loans and guarantees from the foreigners' banks, few of
the creditors believed they would be left in the lurch.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours later, they rode the train back to Hong Kong in
stunned silence. In a curt, 90-minute meeting, Chinese officials
told the creditors that they planned to throw Gitic into
bankruptcy. Bankers who inquired about when they might be repaid
got a blunt response: Take a number and get in line.
</P>
<P>
   China's decision is more than a slap in the face to the banks.
It is a frontal assault on the way business has been conducted in
the world's most populous country. By refusing to bail out Gitic,
China is signaling that investors will be held accountable for
their lending. Gone are the days when foreign bankers could rely on
political connections as a substitute for proper credit-risk
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``People went up there with higher expectations,'' said T.K.
Chang, an expert in Chinese bankruptcy law in the Hong Kong office
of Coudert Brothers, who attended the meeting as a representative
of South Korean banks. ``Nobody expected that it would be put into
bankruptcy.''
</P>
<P>
   And why should they? China has rarely used its bankruptcy law,
although it has been on the books since 1986. And it has never
invoked the law in the case of a major state-owned enterprise _ let
alone one with foreign creditors like Citigroup, Merrill Lynch,
HSBC, and Sumitomo Trust and Banking.
</P>
<P>
   But all that is changing. Beijing's decision to crack down on
profligate borrowing, China watchers say, reflects a broader
crusade by Prime Minister Zhu Rongji to make China's corporate
sector more rational and its economy more efficient. Although China
is growing faster than its Asian neighbors, it shares many of their
frailties _ including a wobbly banking system and bloated state
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Gitic bankruptcy will be a litmus test of Beijing's resolve,
according to lawyers and bankers. Before it can reap the benefits
of more disciplined business practices, the central government must
first show that it can impose an untested bankruptcy law on its
often unruly provinces.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bankruptcy will set the pattern for future insolvencies,
and there will be hundreds of them, if not thousands,'' said Gordon
Chang, a bankruptcy lawyer in the Shanghai office of Paul, Weiss,
Rifkind, Wharton &AMP; Garrison.
</P>
<P>
   Gitic, which is based in this provincial capital, functioned as
the main fund-raising arm of the Guangdong government. Though a
separate company, Gitic is controlled by the provincial
authorities, who have often enlisted it to help finance projects,
like the toll highway that connects Hong Kong to Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, Gitic borrowed billions of dollars _
mostly in foreign currency and not approved by Beijing _ to pay for
a pell-mell expansion into real estate, hotels, securities trading,
even silk manufacturing. Gitic's distinctive orange logo sits atop
dozens of apartment blocks in this clamorous city, while its
63-floor headquarters was until recently Guangzhou's tallest tower.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, most of Gitic's businesses lose money, and the
company capsized under $4.3 billion in debt. When skittish Japanese
and Korean banks called in their loans last fall, Gitic could not
pay. The Guangdong government cobbled together funds to keep it
afloat. But Beijing, eager to rein in the maverick province, shot
down the plan. On Oct. 6, the central government abruptly shut down
Gitic and appointed the People's Bank of China to start liquidating
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This company was basically squandering state resources,'' said
Lawrence Lau, the director of the Center for Economic Policy
Research at Stanford University. ``The province wasn't supposed to
guarantee its loans, but it did. And the Western banks were
colluding with these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Lau and other China experts praised Beijing's hard line, which
they said would help it tackle the far more daunting challenge of
cleaning up China's debt-ridden banks. ``The discussion in Beijing
is: `If we bail out Gitic, will it encourage more behavior like
this?''' Lau said.
</P>
<P>
   The bankers, however, insist they made loans to Gitic in good
faith _ not as part of a collusive deal with provincial leaders.
Many regard Beijing's action as less a courageous stand than a
craven betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   ``China's credibility could be badly damaged by how this was
handled,'' said Brian Lippey, the managing director of Tokai Bank
Ltd., a Japanese bank with modest exposure to Gitic. ``I'm not
saying the government should bail out every company, but the
process has to be in accordance with international norms.''
</P>
<P>
   A leading Hong Kong banker was even blunter. ``This will have
repercussions for years,'' he said, speaking on the condition of
anonymity. ``It will be a few years before people lend again,
because they have deep wounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether that is true or not, the bankers are especially raw
because they believe they had guarantees from provincial officials
that either Guangzhou or Beijing would stand behind their loans if
Gitic went sour. Sometimes these guarantees came in the form of
handshakes; other times they were set out in ``letters of
comfort.''
</P>
<P>
   ``More than 60 bankers said they were told that the government
would pick up the tab if things went wrong,'' the Hong Kong banker
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of Gitic's collapse, banks have begun calling
in loans to other troubled Chinese companies. As they do, more
Chinese companies are defaulting. Dalian International Trust and
Investment Corp., the fund-raising arm of the northern city of
Dalian, recently acknowledged that it had missed payments on
foreign loans. Other investment-trust companies affiliated with
Guangdong, Fujian, and Hubei provinces have also missed payments.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the debt crisis is mainly limited to investment trusts.
These financial institutions, known as ITICs by investors, sprouted
like weeds after Deng Xiaoping opened China's economy in 1978.
Their purpose was to raise money from outside China for the
provinces. But with their loose management and shaky finances, they
became the Chinese equivalent of the U.S. savings and loan debacle.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Beijing said it planned to prune the number of
investment trusts to 40 from 240. That will mean shutting down or
merging scores of ITICs, most of which owe money to foreign banks.
Basisfield, a research firm that tracks corporate debt issues,
estimates that the investment trusts have $5.1 billion in total
debt _ $1.5 billion of it in direct loans from foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
   But now many experts fear the debt crisis is spreading beyond
investment trusts. Guangdong Enterprises Holdings, another
prominent Chinese company, has suspended payments on $2.9 billion
in debt, while it overhauls its operations with the help of
Goldman, Sachs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Guangdong Enterprises is a ``red chip'' _ a Hong Kong-based
company controlled from the mainland, in this case by the Guangdong
government. Formed in 1980, it was one of the first companies set
up by provincial regimes to tap overseas markets. Like Gitic, it
has diverse holdings in trading, property and hotels. Unlike Gitic,
some of its assets would seem to be sure-fire winners.
</P>
<P>
   Its Hong Kong subsidiary, for example, is one of the largest
importers of fresh food from China to Hong Kong. Yet that unit
recently disclosed that it had $391 million in debt and a cash
balance of only $13.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   At the prodding of Goldman, Sachs, Guangdong Enterprises has
owned up to its failings. In a report to creditors on Jan. 12, it
said its woes were the result of ``poor business decisions
historically which have resulted in poor or nonperforming assets
and an overall lack of strategic business focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the Asian economic crisis, red chips were the rocket fuel
that propelled the Hong Kong stock market. Now they are in
disrepute. In a report for investors last November, before it was
hired to fix Guangdong Enterprises, Goldman estimated that the red
chips were groaning under nearly $13 billion in debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bankers are no longer making distinctions between red chips
and other Chinese companies,'' the Hong Kong banker said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said China would hardly wither if foreign banks turned
off their taps. Foreign lending accounts for a relatively small
part of the overall economy, and analysts said the country's four
main domestic banks could pick up much of the slack. Although China
has more than $130 billion in foreign debt, it can draw on vast
household savings to finance public spending.
</P>
<P>
   Still, lawyers are poring over China's bankruptcy law for clues
about how it will handle future insolvencies. While the statute
borrows some elements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, it is vague
about key concepts _ not least the notion of reorganizing a
company, rather than simply liquidating it.
</P>
<P>
   The law also offers little guidance about which creditors should
get priority in the repayment process. It says only that employee
wages, taxes, and legal costs must be paid before creditors are
reimbursed.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers said the Chinese government had already made decisions
that went beyond the statute. To forestall social unrest, it has
decided to bail out 25,000 people who had deposited money in
Gitic's banking unit. It has also declared that creditors whose
loans were registered with Beijing would receive priority over
creditors whose loans were made without its approval.
</P>
<P>
   Legal precedents will be of little help to creditors because the
law has been so seldom used. Before Gitic, the largest bankruptcy
case in Chinese history was that of a sugar mill in the northern
province of Heilongjiang that foundered last November with less
than $100 million in debt. With so much more money involved here,
lawyers said the banks would push the court to impose the law
scrupulously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the bankruptcy law is faulty in the extreme, we're
going to see a lot of improvement very quickly,'' said Chang of
Paul Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   China has plenty of motivation to stick to the rules. If the
court's conduct of the Gitic bankruptcy passes muster with foreign
creditors, experts predict that foreign banks will resume lending
to Chinese companies _ if a good deal more prudently than in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like most things with China, this is neither all good nor all
bad,'' said Richard Margolis, a former British diplomat in Beijing
who is now a strategist for Merrill Lynch in Hong Kong. ``If you're
a creditor, dealing with the nitty-gritty of the bankruptcy, this
is an unmitigated disaster. On the other hand, this is a much
needed and overdue tidying up of China's books.''

 &HT;    JUDGE VOICES DOUBTS ON MICROSOFT'S DEFENSE
 &HT;    Moving in (f) financial and (w) Washington queues
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The presiding judge at the Microsoft trial voiced
doubts Thursday over the core findings of the only economics expert
called by the company to testify in the landmark antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your whole thesis is predicated on the absence of monopoly
power,'' U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson observed,
breaking into what had been a protracted gentle exchange between a
Microsoft lawyer and the witness, Massachusetts Institute of
Technology economics professor Richard Schmalensee.
</P>
<P>
   But Schmalensee stood his ground even as government lawyers,
clearly pleased by the turn of events, exchanged meaningful
glances.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue is largely a red herring,'' Schmalensee told
Jackson. ``It's simply not relevant.... The world is full of empty
threats. But I simply don't understand how there can be an argument
that Microsoft foreclosed distribution (of products) to its
competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   From there, the extended exchange between the witness and the
judge ranged far afield, as they sought, but often failed, to find
common ground at the juncture of modern pricing theory and
venerable antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   To make his point, Schmalensee cited a ``logistical snafu'' that
obliged him to pay full fare for his Boston-to-Washington flight
when he found that he arrived at the airport from MIT without a
ticket in hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I paid a lot more for that trip than the tourist who was, in
theory, sitting next to me,'' Schmalensee noted, ``although that
fact doesn't mean that the airline is a monopolist that can charge
whatever it wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, nodding in sympathy, said he recently had been quoted
three different airline fares within 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But after Schmalensee took Jackson through a somewhat tangled
series of analogies involving relationships among supermarket
owners, sellers of canned corn, parking lot pavers and toothbrush
marketers, the judge concluded: ``I'm not sure that helps here.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate over monopoly power is the central issue in the
13-week trial, in which the government has charged that Microsoft
illegally bundled its Internet browser software into current
versions of its Windows operating systems in order to ``crush''
rival Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, Netscape's popular Navigator browser, coupled with a
programming language called Java, seemed to pose a direct threat to
supplant Windows. But that danger to Microsoft has receded in the
marketplace even as the software giant faces a major legal threat
in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Jackson also asked whether Microsoft, in keeping
today's prices low, might be looking toward ``a larger glory at
some later time.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmalensee said Microsoft sets its Windows prices with an eye
on its ``stream of profits over time,'' seeking to spur growth in a
volatile industry as it maneuvers to keep its customers hooked on
Windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe this is being done for charitable reasons,''
he testified.
</P>
<P>
   But on the wintry courthouse plaza, the Justice Department's
lead lawyer, David Boies, said the focus should be on the huge
profits Microsoft earns and its overwhelming dominance over rival
computer operating systems. Windows accounts for more than 90
percent of personal computers currently being shipped.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't infer the presence or absence of monopoly power just
by prices,'' Boies said. ``Microsoft is making huge profits,
monopoly profits, on what it charges.''
</P>
<P>
   After court resumes Monday, Schmalensee will again take the
witness stand for a sixth time. But the courtroom will be sealed to
receive pricing testimony that the company views as trade secrets.
</P>
<P>
   When the door opens, it will be to hear from Paul Maritz, the
company's group vice president for the platforms and applications,
and the first of nine Microsoft executives who have been called as
defense witnesses.

 &HT;    JUDGE VOICES DOUBTS ON MICROSOFT'S DEFENSE
 &HT;    Moving in (f) financial and (w) Washington queues
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The presiding judge at the Microsoft trial voiced
doubts Thursday over the core findings of the only economics expert
called by the company to testify in the landmark antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your whole thesis is predicated on the absence of monopoly
power,'' U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson observed,
breaking into what had been a protracted gentle exchange between a
Microsoft lawyer and the witness, Massachusetts Institute of
Technology economics professor Richard Schmalensee.
</P>
<P>
   But Schmalensee stood his ground even as government lawyers,
clearly pleased by the turn of events, exchanged meaningful
glances.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue is largely a red herring,'' Schmalensee told
Jackson. ``It's simply not relevant.... The world is full of empty
threats. But I simply don't understand how there can be an argument
that Microsoft foreclosed distribution (of products) to its
competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   From there, the extended exchange between the witness and the
judge ranged far afield, as they sought, but often failed, to find
common ground at the juncture of modern pricing theory and
venerable antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   To make his point, Schmalensee cited a ``logistical snafu'' that
obliged him to pay full fare for his Boston-to-Washington flight
when he found that he arrived at the airport from MIT without a
ticket in hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I paid a lot more for that trip than the tourist who was, in
theory, sitting next to me,'' Schmalensee noted, ``although that
fact doesn't mean that the airline is a monopolist that can charge
whatever it wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, nodding in sympathy, said he recently had been quoted
three different airline fares within 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But after Schmalensee took Jackson through a somewhat tangled
series of analogies involving relationships among supermarket
owners, sellers of canned corn, parking lot pavers and toothbrush
marketers, the judge concluded: ``I'm not sure that helps here.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate over monopoly power is the central issue in the
13-week trial, in which the government has charged that Microsoft
illegally bundled its Internet browser software into current

GROENING'S NEW WORLD, 1,000 YEARS FROM SPRINGFIELD  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 24)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ore.)  (af) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA MONICA, Calif. _ Matt Groening looks like an ordinary guy,
sitting at an ocean-view table at Shutters on the Beach. At 44, he
has a little gray, a little paunch and the attention to fashion of
a successful hardware salesman (knit shirt and khakis).
</P>
<P>
   People at the hotel's restaurant are paying more attention to
Tom Hanks, who is having brunch with a large group across the room.
But Groening (pronounced graining) is the man who created Homer,
Marge, Bart, Lisa and the laconic infant Maggie Simpson, and he is
not unaware of how much clout that gives him, especially as he
prepares to introduce his first new series since ``The Simpsons''
became a half-hour comedy in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Selling the idea for ``Futurama,'' which is scheduled for a
March premiere on Fox, was a little easier than selling ``The
Simpsons,'' he admits. This time ``I basically breezed through the
door with Peter Roth,'' says Groening, referring to the recently
departed president of Fox Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Still, network executives were a little nervous about the new
animated show, because it didn't seem as much like Groening's first
series as they would have liked. ``I told them, `It is like `The
Simpsons,' '' says Groening. `` `It's new and original.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Futurama'' is set in the year 3000 in New New York City, which
is built atop the ruins of the original New York. Ruins? ``Alien
invasion,'' Groening says matter-of-factly. The Empire State
Building is still around, but only the top 22 floors and the
observation tower. There are no more pigeons in the city because
they've been wiped out by owls. ``They're cute owls, too,''
Groening adds.
</P>
<P>
   The characters in ``Futurama'' have familiar, Simpsonian bulging
eyes and overbites but unlike the Simpsons and their Springfield
neighbors, as Groening points out, their skin is not yellow. Any
particular reason? ``Evolution.'' And of course there are aliens
living in New York, ``just like now.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the show's main characters is Fry, a human earthling who
was accidentally frozen on Dec. 31, 1999, and wakes up on Dec. 31,
2999, in a strange new world. His best friend is Leela, a cyclops
space-alien woman. They're often seen with Bender, a ``very corrupt
robot'' who is not happy with his career programming and wants to
be a cook. In the future, ``people are definitely slotted at a very
young age because of testing,'' Groening explains, ``but these
tests are right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Futurama'' comes to television in an environment for
prime-time animation that is very different from the one ``The
Simpsons'' faced. In 1989 there hadn't been a hit prime-time
network animated series since ``The Flintstones.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, adult viewers have ``King of the Hill'' on Fox; ``South
Park,'' ``Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist'' and ``Bob and
Margaret'' on Comedy Central; and ``Daria,'' a ``Beavis and
Butt-head'' spinoff, on MTV. And at least three network animated
series (``Dilbert,'' ``Family Guy'' and Eddie Murphy's ``P.J.'s'')
have premieres this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Critic'' didn't make it on ABC in 1994 but lives on on
cable. With this kind of overload, is even Groening's genius a
guarantee of success?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no guarantees,'' says Mike Darnell, Fox's executive
vice president for specials and alternative programming (which
includes animated shows), ``but I think it has a wonderful shot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not looking at animated shows as animated anymore,'' he
adds. ``They're just comedy. No matter how much animation comes on
the scene, it's going to be survival of the funniest.''
</P>
<P>
   Groening, who has so far ranked among the funniest, grew up in
Portland, Ore., the son of an advertising executive whose claim to
fame was the creation of the Jantzen Smile Girl competition, a
national beauty contest for a swimsuit company. After graduating
from Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash., the young Groening
moved to Los Angeles to become a writer.
</P>
<P>
   He was 28 when he began drawing ``Life in Hell,'' a comic strip
(sometimes described as ``bleakly humorous'') about Jeff and Akbar,
two affectionate fez-wearing look-alikes, and two rabbits named
Binky and Bongo. Once asked whether Jeff and Akbar were brothers or
a gay couple or what, Groening answered, ``Whatever offends you the
most.'' By the late 1980s, the strip was syndicated in 200
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But it was ``The Simpsons'' that changed Groening's life. The
characters began as short cartoons on Fox's ``Tracey Ullman Show''
in 1987. The characters had their own television special,
``Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire,'' in December 1989, followed a
month later by the premiere of the half-hour series. By spring, the
Simpsons were the hottest names in merchandising and licensing,
being compared to other big names of the year like the Teen-Age
Mutant Ninja Turtles and New Kids on the Block.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, everyone was worried when in fall 1990 the show was
moved to Thursday nights opposite ``The Cosby Show,'' a solid hit
that had been the No. 1 prime-time series since 1985. But the Cosby
popularity was slipping, now that several of the show's young
characters had grown up, and rather than being vanquished ``The
Simpsons'' turned the situation into a ratings war.
</P>
<P>
   Both shows lost viewers, and in 1992 ``The Cosby Show'' went off
the air. ``The Simpsons'' remained on Thursday nights until 1994,
when it moved back to Sundays. It has been there, and Groening has
been reaping the benefits, ever since.
</P>
<P>
   He looks a little more mogul-like after brunch when the parking
attendant brings his black BMW convertible and he calls his
housekeeper on the car speakerphone to check on whether the waves
are threatening to engulf the Malibu house. He drives to the
``Futurama'' office on Sepulveda Boulevard where at least a dozen
employees are working on Sunday, even though the premiere is months
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our crunch is six months before it goes on the air,'' explains
David Cohen, the executive producer. In the editing room, Cohen and
two other employees are playing various versions of one line:
``Leela, it's real velour. Just let yourself go.'' They are taking
the creation of this future world very seriously, he says.
</P>
<P>
   One staff person is currently worried about whether the crescent
of the moon looks exactly the way it really will 1,000 years from
now.
</P>
<P>
   Claudia Katz, the producer at Rough Draft, the Glendale
animation studio for the series, stresses, ``It can't just be `The
Simpsons' in space.'' Some episodes will be set on Earth; some
won't. A brief film clip, in fact, looks a little like a scene from
``The Fifth Element,'' Luc Besson's futuristic 1997 thriller in
which Bruce Willis drove a flying Manhattan taxi.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Around Ms. Katz, a building full of people (Groening calls it
``Santa's workshop'') are hard at work, drawing ``Futurama''
characters following guidelines in the 72-page Character
Construction Model Pack like ``Try to avoid showing Fry's gums''
and ``Bender's body is shaped like a Slurpee cup.'' One scene shows
a 31st-century product advertisement: ``Robo Fresh. Designed by a
robot. For a robot.''
</P>
<P>
   A tour of the office also introduces new characters like
Professor Farnsworth, who looks like a cross between Burns and
Grandpa Simpson. There are new revelations about other characters,
like Fry's habit of keeping a 20-pound bag of Bachelor Chow in his
apartment and the news that Bender the robot, according to Ms.
Katz, drinks, smokes and has ``a horrible pornography problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Groening sums up the ``Futurama'' personae. ``It's a small group
of characters who really don't fit in'' in the legislated
conformity of the future, he says. ``They do what they want to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   So the message of the series is about the value of individuality
and being true to oneself? Groening nods, then quickly says, ``I
can't believe I have a message.''

 &HT;    BUSH, DOLE ATTACKED BY CONSERVATIVE GOP CANDIDATES
 &HT;    360&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Va. _ The moderate policies of Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas and former American Red Cross President Elizabeth Dole came
under attack Thursday by fellow Republicans speaking at the
Conservative Political Action Committee's annual conference.
</P>
<P>
   The speeches came as GOP conservatives, dispirited by President
Clinton's political resilience and their own party's cautious
legislative agenda, began reviewing a parade of presidential
candidates they hope will lead the party back to the glory days of
Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Publisher Steve Forbes said that as the 2000 campaign nears,
Republicans are getting the ``same familiar chorus'' of
``mealy-mouthed rhetoric'' that led the GOP into defeat against
Clinton in 1992 and again in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Bush, the governor's father, lost to Clinton in
1992. Former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, the husband of the
former Red Cross chief, lost to Clinton in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even a few of the names sound familiar,'' Forbes quipped.
``But, my friends, we have been down that electoral cul-de-sac
twice before. I suggest we try something new for a change _ like
winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Forbes told reporters that both Bush and Dole would be
``effective and potent'' candidates if they decide to run for
president. But he dodged questions about whether Bush and Dole are
the kind of ``establishment Republicans'' who had abandoned
conservative principles.
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee dismissed Bush's
philosophy of ``compassionate conservatism'' as ``weasel words''
designed to ``confuse people
</P>
<P>
   by meaning nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander also singled out the governor's father for criticism,
accusing him of ``violating the bedrock conservative principle of
lower taxes and smaller government'' by abandoning his famous
``read my lips, no new taxes'' pledge.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, chairman of the Family Research Council, a
conservative group that concentrates on abortion and other social
issues, cautioned the GOP against blaming the American people for
Clinton's political successes. He said Republicans had lost to
Clinton ``because we twice failed to give the American people a
viable alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   From the podium and from the conference floor on the first day
of the CPAC gathering, many said their mission was to force their
party leaders to return to the GOP bedrock issues championed by
Reagan: tax cuts, school choice and outlawing abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to send a message not only to Bill Clinton but to the
Republican Party leaders that Monica Lewinsky is not much of an
agenda item,'' David Keene, chairman of CPAC.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican Washington establishment seems to have
forgotten that,'' said Susan Davis, a McLean, Va., real estate
agent.
</P>
<P>
   GOP conservatives are ``looking for someone to lead them out of
the wilderness,'' said William Kristol, ABC News analyst and
publisher of the conservative magazine The Weekly Standard. ``They
see an impeached president who is at the height of his political
power and they don't quite understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Senate's impeachment trial, Clinton's job approval
ratings are topping 70 percent following his State of the Union
speech this week.
</P>
<P>
   Celinda Lake, a prominent Democratic pollster, said Thursday
those ratings are matched in her polling by voter disapproval of
the GOP rivaling that during the Watergate scandal that toppled
President Nixon in 1974. At the time of Nixon's resignation, only
about 25 percent of the American electorate approved of the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   If the GOP removes Clinton from office, ``they'll pay a price
for it,'' Lake said at a breakfast with reporters. ``If the
Republicans throw Bill Clinton out, we'll be the majority party for
the rest of our lives.''

 By BRUCE SHENITZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Reading is an essentially solitary activity, but
talking about books requires at least two people. Even if you live
with another bibliovore, what are the chances that you will both be
struck by the desire to read and discuss, say, ``Bleak House'' or
``Ulysses'' at precisely the same moment? The growing popularity of
reading groups and book clubs attests to the desire to talk about
books as well as read them.
</P>
<P>
   Another motivation for joining such groups, suggested Alberto
Manguel, author of ``A History of Reading,'' is that it ``makes you
feel less guilty about an activity that society sees as leisure,
entertainment or diversion.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said, ``it gives us an alibi for this kind of
guilty pleasure.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, New Yorkers have been gathering together for general
book talk for more than 100 years, said Thomas Bender, a professor
of history at New York University. Around the turn of the century,
he said, such groups played an important part in the city's
cultural life.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon of the author as a star had already developed in
Europe earlier in the 19th century, Manguel said, when groups were
organized to discuss the works of a single author. A number of
English societies were established to read and discuss Robert
Browning during his lifetime, said Bob Griffiths, vice president of
the New York Browning Society, and the poet often made the rounds
among his enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   While some people come together to celebrate a favorite author,
others are seeking intellectual support as they undertake a long,
difficult work like ``Remembrance of Things Past'' or ``Finnegans
Wake.'' No statistics are kept on how many such groups exist in New
York, but at least a dozen maintain an active schedule of reading
groups, lectures and other events. There are also a number of
societies that publish journals and hold one or two meetings a
year, often in conjunction with groups like the Modern Language
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the intellectual stimulation they receive,
participants enjoy sharing their enthusiasm with like-minded
people. This sometimes leads to the members' taking on a bit of
``their'' author's style. The members of the Jane Austen Society,
for example, seem to speak in well-constructed paragraphs
containing wry apercus, while the ``Finnegans Wake'' readers can
range through the entire world of human experience while discussing
one word of the text. Samuel Pickwick might have felt quite at home
at a meeting of the jovial Dickens Fellowship, and the Sherlock
Holmes enthusiasts delight in arch wordplay and tongue-in-cheek
scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Some people even have divided loyalties: the Shaw and Yeats
societies have some joint activities as well as members in common,
and a fair number of James Joyce enthusiasts have joined the
relatively new Proust reading group. At some point, members of a
society are likely to pull aside a visitor to whisper that it is
the people in ``other'' groups who are the strange birds. (It was
the Joyce fans who most often elicited this description, but they
appeared no more impassioned than any other enthusiasts.)
</P>
<P>
   One Sherlockian might have been speaking for all the literary
society members when she said, ``We're eccentric, but we're
harmless.''

<P>
   ``Our tough new (drunk driving) laws and aggressive public
education must send a simple and blunt message: Drive Hammered, Get
Nailed.'' _ Jane Dee Hull (R) Arizona

often than not, the statue.'' _ Mike Huckabee (R) Arkansas

 &HT;    BUSH, DOLE ATTACKED BY CONSERVATIVE GOP CANDIDATES
 &HT;    360&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Va. _ The moderate policies of Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas and former American Red Cross President Elizabeth Dole came
under attack Thursday by fellow Republicans speaking at the
Conservative Political Action Committee's annual conference.
</P>
<P>
   The speeches came as GOP conservatives, dispirited by President
Clinton's political resilience and their own party's cautious
legislative agenda, began reviewing a parade of presidential
candidates they hope will lead the party back to the glory days of
Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Publisher Steve Forbes said that as the 2000 campaign nears,
Republicans are getting the ``same familiar chorus'' of
``mealy-mouthed rhetoric'' that led the GOP into defeat against
Clinton in 1992 and again in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Bush, the governor's father, lost to Clinton in
1992. Former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, the husband of the
former Red Cross chief, lost to Clinton in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even a few of the names sound familiar,'' Forbes quipped.
``But, my friends, we have been down that electoral cul-de-sac
twice before. I suggest we try something new for a change _ like
winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Forbes told reporters that both Bush and Dole would be
``effective and potent'' candidates if they decide to run for
president. But he dodged questions about whether Bush and Dole are
the kind of ``establishment Republicans'' who had abandoned
conservative principles.
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee dismissed Bush's
philosophy of ``compassionate conservatism'' as ``weasel words''
designed to ``confuse people
</P>
<P>
   by meaning nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander also singled out the governor's father for criticism,
accusing him of ``violating the bedrock conservative principle of
lower taxes and smaller government'' by abandoning his famous
``read my lips, no new taxes'' pledge.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, chairman of the Family Research Council, a
conservative group that concentrates on abortion and other social
issues, cautioned the GOP against blaming the American people for
Clinton's political successes. He said Republicans had lost to
Clinton ``because we twice failed to give the American people a
viable alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   From the podium and from the conference floor on the first day
of the CPAC gathering, many said their mission was to force their
party leaders to return to the GOP bedrock issues championed by
Reagan: tax cuts, school choice and outlawing abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to send a message not only to Bill Clinton but to the
Republican Party leaders that Monica Lewinsky is not much of an
agenda item,'' David Keene, chairman of CPAC.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican Washington establishment seems to have
forgotten that,'' said Susan Davis, a McLean, Va., real estate
agent.
</P>
<P>
   GOP conservatives are ``looking for someone to lead them out of
the wilderness,'' said William Kristol, ABC News analyst and
publisher of the conservative magazine The Weekly Standard. ``They
see an impeached president who is at the height of his political
power and they don't quite understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Senate's impeachment trial, Clinton's job approval
ratings are topping 70 percent following his State of the Union
speech this week.
</P>
<P>
   Celinda Lake, a prominent Democratic pollster, said Thursday
those ratings are matched in her polling by voter disapproval of
the GOP rivaling that during the Watergate scandal that toppled
President Nixon in 1974. At the time of Nixon's resignation, only
about 25 percent of the American electorate approved of the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   If the GOP removes Clinton from office, ``they'll pay a price
for it,'' Lake said at a breakfast with reporters. ``If the
Republicans throw Bill Clinton out, we'll be the majority party for
the rest of our lives.''

 NEW YORK: we're harmless.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a user's guide to some of the New York societies devoted
to a single writer:
</P>
<P>
   New York Joyceans
</P>
<P>
   When the Modern Library named James Joyce's ``Ulysses'' the No.
1 choice in its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the
century, members of the James Joyce Society figured that the rest
of the world had finally realized what they already knew. ``
`Ulysses' is such a rich, human, universal kind of book that it
speaks to human experience in a way that no other book has done for
me,'' said David Rose, a society member from Westchester. Joyce
enthusiasts have a number of groups to choose from.
</P>
<P>
   The James Joyce Society, the oldest of these groups, held its
first meeting at the Gotham Book Mart on West 47th Street in
Manhattan in 1947, and is still there. The group's continuing
association with the bookstore can be traced back to the store's
legendary owner, Frances Steloff, who long functioned as an
informal clearinghouse for scholars and admirers of Joyce.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the society's activities, there are two reading
groups working their way though ``Finnegans Wake,'' a book that
even the most avid Joycean will acknowledge needs the benefit of
several brains to make sense of. (Study groups started poring over
the work while excerpts were being printed beginning in 1924, 15
years before the book's publication.)
</P>
<P>
   The general group, which is open to all comers, covers anywhere
from two to six pages a session. Still too fast? If you show up and
demonstrate your devotion to the work, you might be invited to join
the ``sub-group,'' which also meets monthly but delves even deeper:
it's taken about four years to get to page 36, and the book begins
on page 3. ``We all have reasons for this study, but way down on
the bottom of the list is actually finishing the `Wake,' '' said
Murray J. Gross, a lawyer who leads both reading groups.
</P>
<P>
   The James Joyce Society is open to anyone with an interest in
the writer, but apparently some beginners felt they might be more
comfortable with a less scholarly group. Stanley Goldstein, the
founder of the American Friends of James Joyce, is also a member of
the James Joyce Society, but, he said, ``They're over my head.'' He
explained the need for the new group by saying, ``I can't play
baseball as well as Mickey Mantle, but I still love to play
baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   The new group made its debut last year on Bloomsday _ June 16,
named for the day in 1904 on which Leopold Bloom traversed Dublin
in ``Ulysses'' _ as the New York hosts of a global Internet reading
of the novel. A monthly reading is often led by Goldstein, who uses
a text-oriented ``Great Books'' approach. In a recent discussion of
the story ``After the Race'' from ``Dubliners,'' Goldstein moved
the discussion along crisply, occasionally seeking a comment from
the more reticent members of the group. If you decide to go, be
sure to do your reading: Goldstein will insist on specific passage
references to back up interpretations.
</P>
<P>
   Proust Society of America
</P>
<P>
   The sheer volume of Marcel Proust's ``Remembrance of Things
Past'' has made it one of the more formidable mountains of
20th-century literature. But there has been a revival of interest
in the French writer; two recent popular books, ``How Proust Can
Change Your Life,'' by Alain de Botton, and ``The Year of Reading
Proust,'' by Phyllis Rose, made a case for reading Proust today.
</P>
<P>
   Why Proust and why now? It may be a reaction to the literary
minimalism of the last several decades, suggested Harold
Augenbraum, director of the Mercantile Library and the leader of a
monthly reading group run by the Proust Society of America.
</P>
<P>
   At its current pace of 50 to 150 pages a session, the group will
take two to three years to get through the work. In addition to
running the reading group, the society publishes a newsletter and
sponsors periodic lectures.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Austen Society
</P>
<P>
   Pity the members of the Jane Austen Society of North America.
They are among the most passionate of devotees, but they have only
six novels and the author's minor writings to read. To compensate,
the New York chapter newsletter features a column called ``What to
Read When You Are Not Reading Jane Austen,'' which addresses
fiction by her contemporaries, or even reviews of such moderns as
Anita Brookner, who might be thought to write in Austen's spirit.
</P>
<P>
   A recent meeting of the monthly book group discussed Ms.
Brookner's ``Hotel du Lac'' and asked if its protagonist was ``a
Jane Austen heroine gone wrong.'' But even Catalina Hannan, who led
the discussion, acknowledged that if the group is discussing a
non-Austen work, ``I don't want them to complain that Jane Austen
didn't write it.'' Measuring other writers against Austen, Miss
Hannan said, is ``pointless because we consider her the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare Society
</P>
<P>
   It's surprising that one of the longest-standing masters has
given rise to the newest New York group devoted to a single
author's works. The Shakespeare Society is barely a year old, but
it has already run several symposiums and organized reading groups
in and around New York. The founders, Nancy Becker and Adriana
Mnuchin, looked around and saw literary groups devoted to other
writers, and were surprised to discover that while there were
plenty of academic groups devoted to Shakespeare, there were none
for people who simply loved the plays. Mrs. Becker and her husband
had already started one cultural group, the Beethoven Society, so
the two women started work on another.
</P>
<P>
   The Shakespeare Society has almost 500 members and several
reading groups under way. Mrs. Mnuchin, who has a background in
chain-store retailing, would like to see ``a web'' of chapters
throughout the country. Among the goals of the group is to run
workshops for educators in order to improve the teaching of
Shakespeare in high schools and elementary schools.
</P>
<P>
   Dickens Fellowship
</P>
<P>
   The Dickens Fellowship of New York began in 1905, but it almost
didn't make it into the '90s. When Rose Roberts, the current
president, joined eight years ago, the organization was foundering
and at one point the membership was down to three. Ms. Roberts, who
was once a professional ballroom dancer and now owns a Manhattan
travel agency, has been largely responsible for reviving the group.
The society holds a monthly discussion that addresses a different
Dickens work each year; last year, members read ``The Mystery of
Edwin Drood,'' and they are about to undertake ``Bleak House.''
</P>
<P>
   A highlight of the discussions is the rhymed couplets by Morton
Jacober, the group's ``poet laureate.'' Members joke about their
fanatical devotion to Dickens and describe themselves as ``nuts''
about him. As Jacober wrote in a birthday salute:
</P>
<P>
   Now salute our author so divine, Ever to be a rare vintage wine.
So keep reading Dickens to the end, He is indeed Our Mutual Friend.

 NEW YORK: Mutual Friend.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sherlock Holmes Groups
</P>
<P>
   The many groups of Sherlockians, as they call themselves, are
ultimately descended from the Baker Street Irregulars, the club
founded by the novelist and essayist Christopher Morley in 1934.
There are several in New York and its suburbs. One group, the
Adventuresses of Sherlock Holmes, developed out of a 1968 picketing
of the annual Baker Street Irregulars dinner to protest its
men-only policy. Women have since been admitted to the Irregulars,
and there are a couple of men in the Adventuresses. The different
clubs often hold joint events, like a spring reading.
</P>
<P>
   The Victorian detective continues to fascinate because the
stories by his creator, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, ``don't pall on
rereading,'' says the Adventuresses co-founder, Evelyn A. Herzog.
As much as the stories themselves, Sherlockians seem to enjoy one
another's company, along with pseudo-scholarly wordplay and ritual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who you are in the world is not immensely important,'' Ms.
Herzog said. ``It's how funny you are, how witty you are, how good
you are at making up songs in short order. It's a nice step away
from the real world.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Shaw Society
</P>
<P>
   Every theater season seems to bring at least one play by George
Bernard Shaw to New York. The plays remain popular because ``he was
so far ahead of his time that contemporary society is just now
beginning to deal with the subjects he tackled,'' said Rhoda
Nathan, president of the Bernard Shaw Society and a professor of
English at Hofstra University.
</P>
<P>
   His play ``Getting Married,'' she noted, treats open marriage,
prenuptial contracts and lesbian motherhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the most far-seeing and the most revolutionary of
playwrights,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   While the society does not have reading groups at this time, it
has several public events each year, including lectures and
symposiums by prominent Shaw scholars, actors and directors.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Twain Circle
</P>
<P>
   Just about every organization, literary or otherwise, seems to
go through periods of dormancy or inactivity, which, with any luck,
are followed by reinvigoration. Peter Salwen, a public relations
executive and author, is trying to bring about that kind of revival
with the Mark Twain Circle of New York. Formerly known as the Mark
Twain Association of New York, the group was established in 1926 by
a New York City public school teacher to study the humorist's
writings and his New York associations. (It managed to create at
least one New York association of its own: at a luncheon in 1958,
Hal Holbrook first presented his one-man show ``Mark Twain
Tonight.'')
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the group's membership dwindled as the average
age increased; when the longtime president died two years ago, the
organization threatened to fade away completely.
</P>
<P>
   Salwen organized a brunch at Pete's Tavern in Manhattan over the
summer for anyone interested in reviving the group, and more than
50 people showed up.
</P>
<P>
   W.B. Yeats Society
</P>
<P>
   When Andrew McGowan, a public service announcement producer,
stopped by the Yeats Summer School in Sligo, Ireland, he thought he
was simply doing research for a history-based play. When it was
suggested that someone ought to organize a group in New York
dedicated to the Irish poet, he took up the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the group's first meeting on Yeats' birthday in 1990,
McGowan has been the president and moving force. The W.B. Yeats
Society of New York organizes readings and lectures, often with
other literary groups, including the James Joyce Society and the
Bernard Shaw Society.
</P>
<P>
   The club also helps promote interest in the annual Yeats Summer
School, which sometimes has unintended results. When Hillary Harrow
attended the school a few summers ago, she met Declan Kiely, an
Englishman who was writing a dissertation on Yeats. The two are now
married.
</P>
<P>
   Who says poetry can't change your life?
</P>
<P>
   C.S. Lewis Society
</P>
<P>
   There are many paths that lead people to C.S. Lewis, and most of
them contain a spiritual component. But the Oxford don, who wrote
prolifically on Christianity and spirituality, also wrote scholarly
literary works and science fiction and fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``His achievement as a man of letters is as great as any in the
English language in the last 300 years,'' said James Como, a
professor of speech communication at York College in Queens and the
author of ``Branches to Heaven: The Geniuses of C.S. Lewis,'' a
recently published study.
</P>
<P>
   Como, one of the founders of the New York C.S. Lewis Society 30
years ago, likes to point out that contrary to Lewis' popular image
as a stodgy academic, he was in the midst of reading ``Les Liaisons
Dangereuses'' when he died in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Several members of the society joked that they were wary of
joining a ``cult,'' when they first came to the group, but Como
said that when one member suggested beginning the monthly meetings
with a reading from Scripture, he was roundly hooted down.
</P>
<P>
   New York Browning Society
</P>
<P>
   Robert and Elizabeth Barrett Browning were among the most
popular poets of the late-19th and early 20th centuries. For some
poetry aficionados, the attraction has never faded. ``The draw is
the incredible fusion between their real lives and artistic
lives,'' said Griffiths, the vice president of the New York
Browning Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an absolutely magnificent love story that never could
have been invented.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Robert Browning's poetry, it presents a series of
psychological puzzles that continue to fascinate readers, said Glen
Al Omans, the society's president.
</P>
<P>
   The group holds monthly meetings, which are always followed by
tea.
</P>
<P>
   It also sponsors an annual poetry contest for high school
students in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Betsy-Tacy Society
</P>
<P>
   What do Anna Quindlen and Bette Midler have in common? They are
both devoted readers of the Betsy-Tacy books, a young adult series
that chronicles the lives of two young women growing up in a
Minnesota town at the turn of the century. The 10 books, by Maud
Hart Lovelace, follow Betsy Ray and Tacy Kelly from girlhood
through marriage; though the series has not attracted the following
of ``Anne of Green Gables,'' its fans are equally devoted.
</P>
<P>
   Just what is it that attracts grown-up professional women to
gather together to discuss the books? Many were originally struck
by the fact that they featured female characters with professional
ambitions that their families supported.
</P>
<P>
   Betsy eventually becomes a writer, and her older sister Julia,
an opera singer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was not only a wonderful family, a wonderful town; they
get to pursue their destiny,'' said Andrea Shaw, a writer and one
of the original members of the New York chapter of the society.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's why the subject of Ms. Quindlen's 1993 address to
the Twin Cities Betsy-Tacy Society was ``Betsy Ray, Feminist
Icon.'' The society was also formed in part ``to facilitate
friendships and communication between Lovelace fans of all ages.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is hardly a surprise since ``what the books do is
celebrate friendship,'' Ms. Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolfe Pack
</P>
<P>
   It took some doing and a bit of imagination, but the fans of
Nero Wolfe, Rex Stout's corpulent, orchid-raising gourmet
detective, now have a plaque to commemorate the sleuth's probable
Manhattan residence at 454 W. 35th St. The books place the
fictional detective's brownstone at various spots along the street;
some of the addresses given would put it in the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   None of this troubles members of the Wolfe Pack, a club of Nero
Wolfe enthusiasts that celebrated its 20th anniversary last year.
</P>
<P>
   In the world of armchair detectives, Wolfe truly deserves the
name: he rarely leaves home to solve a crime, usually delegating
the gumshoe work to his assistant, the dashing Archie Goodwin.
</P>
<P>
   Even his devoted fans make no brief for Rex Stout's plotting.
Instead they read him for ``unparalleled characterizations and
subtle humor,'' said Jonathan Levine, the group's treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   The club has four major events a year, including the Shad Roe
Dinner and the Black Orchid Banquet. Every two months, there is
also a dinner and discussion group centered on a book in the
series.

   MUSICAL-MAKEOVERS (subslug) (New York) _ The birth of a new
musical: it's all so ``Act One,'' all so invigorating. Hey, hold on
a sec. Did I say new? The show in question is ``Annie Get Your
Gun,'' and while the frantic pre-Broadway preparations, with
Bernadette Peters as pistol-packin' Annie Oakley, are indeed
occurring in 1999, the date on the musical's copyright is 1946.
Although it was a critical and popular success in the 40s, running
on Broadway for 1,147 performances, the show, with music and lyrics
by Irving Berlin and book by Herbert and Dorothy Fields, has long
been considered unrevivable, in large part because of its
hopelessly outdated portrayal of Indians. The solution that the
show's producers, Fran and Barry Weissler, came up with for ``Annie
Get Your Gun,'' which begins previews on Feb. 2 at the Marquis
Theater on Broadway, is one that has become increasingly common in
musical theater: wholesale renovation. ``Basically, it's a new
book,'' said Peter Stone, the veteran librettist, with credits
stretching from ``1776'' to ``Titanic,'' who was hired to bring the
structure and sensibility of ``Annie Get Your Gun'' into line with
musicals of the late 1990s. By Peter Marks. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   STANDUP-COMEDIANS (New York) _ There's only one thing more
humiliating than being a stand-up comic. And that's trying to be a
stand-up comic. That's the lesson I learned after six months trying
to make it as a comedian. Ask Jerry Seinfeld, Rosie O'Donnell or
any successful stand-up: the bottom rung of the comedy ladder can
be uglier, crueler and more demeaning than in any other line of
entertainment _ be it actor, model, musician, writer or clown.
Sexism and racism run rampant, club-owners ask struggling comedians
to scrape gum off the bottom of tables to get a booking,
competition between comics is fierce, and newcomers have to pay to
perform. By Neil Strauss. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   FILM AND VIDEO
</P>
<P>
   DRY-CLEANING-FILM (Paris) _ Miou-Miou, 48, has appeared in good
films and bad, hits and flops, yet for 25 years France's affection
for her has not wavered. True, being loved has been no guarantee of
good screen roles or healthy box-office returns. Yet, for an entire
generation of French moviegoers, she remains reassuringly familiar.
Her very stage name, Miou-Miou, given to her by a lover when she
was barely 18, makes her sound like the gamine next door. Her
latest film is Anne Fontaine's ``Nettoyage a Sec,''or ``Dry
Cleaning,'' which was well received in France 15 months ago and
opens on Feb. 5 in New York. By Alan Riding. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   EUROPE-SEX-FILMS (Undated) _ When it comes to issues of sexual
identity, European films can be difficult for American viewers to
talk about or even understand fully. We assume that Europeans,
whose leaders can carry on extramarital affairs without falling
from grace, are more sophisticated, more laissez-faire about sex in
general and, specifically, about the blurring of hetero-, bi- and
homosexuality. But we can't quite figure out how they achieve this
nonchalance. By Will Joyner. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   DANCE
</P>
<P>
   BALLET-BRITISH-COLUMBIA (Vancouver, British Columbia) _ Back in
1985, when the latest of a series of West Coast balletic phoenixes
rose tentatively from the ashes of Pacific Ballet Theater, nothing
so ambitious as a passport appeared on the agenda for the new
Ballet British Columbia. It was to be a Vancouver-based company
with a regional mission, to bring ballet to the various centers of
its home province. Less than a decade later, the company was
dancing at Whitman Hall at Brooklyn College, where it was
characterized by Anna Kisselgoff in The New York Times as ``a
handsome group of 16 classical dancers whose bold demeanor evokes
the tough, frank manner of contemporary ballet troupes in Europe.''
In its return one-week New York engagement starting Tuesday at the
Joyce Theater, the program will consist of contemporary Canadian
works, according to its artistic director John Alleyne. By William
Littler. 9Moved).
</P>
<P>
   THEATER
</P>
<P>
   AKALAITIS-THEATER (New York) _ Ms. JoAnne Akalaitis, 60, has
been called a theater radical whose work grows increasingly
distilled, profound and challenging, as well as a bloodless
modernist who disrespects Shakespeare, debases the Greeks and
shamelessly distorts Jean Genet and Tennessee Williams. The
symbolist gestures she favors _ sometimes her actors move in a kind
of slow-motion Kabuki style or fall to the ground as if pulled by a
demonic force _ have been celebrated as inspired and decried as
gimmicky. Fans say her penchant for updating classics makes them
see the works anew; critics complain that she has a narrow academic
vision and that her changes are gratuitous and distracting. Ms.
Akalaitis is currently working on the ``The Iphigenia Cycle.'' By
Nancy Hass. (Moved). Photo.

   LONDON-SYMPHONY (Undated) _ Sir Colin Davis and the London
Symphony will appear at Avery Fisher Hall in New York City for
three concerts focusing on another enigmatic post-Romantic
composer, Sir Edward Elgar. The series, part of a larger festival,
``The Glory of Britain: Sir Edward Elgar,'' presented by Great
Performers at Lincoln Center, opens Sunday afternoon with Elgar's
Introduction and Allegro, and Cello Concerto (with Steven Isserlis
as soloist). By Anthony Tommasini. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   GERMAN-SONGS-CLASSES (New York) _ At a lecture before a recent
lieder recital in Los Angeles, Graham Johnson made a case for
balkanizing Schubert, after a fashion. Johnson, a piano
accompanist, scholar and teacher based in London, suggested that
the six songs Schubert wrote to texts by Heine included in the
posthumous song cycle ``Schwanengesang'' be split off and viewed as
a free-standing work. The idea is vintage Johnson, unconventional
yet compelling. Monday, at the Juilliard School, Johnson begins a
series of five master classes for singers and accompanists focusing
on German song. By David Mermelstein. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   POP-MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   VERNON-DUKE-MUSIC (Undated) _ There is something so improbably
consoling about the sadness at the heart of the best Vernon Duke
melodies. This redemptive afterglow could be a consequence of sheer
melodic sophistication; Duke knew how to construct a song,
elegantly, with surpassing craft and harmonic flair. An
aristocratic White Russian emigre turned Broadway songwriter, he
seems to have had a rather good time of it all, dressing with
notorious sartorial dash, charming in a polyglot of romance
languages chorus girls and theatrical producers alike. Among some
of his popular songs were ``Autumn in New York,'' ``April in
Paris'' and ``I Can't get Started.'' By Barry Singer. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ART
</P>
<P>
   PHILLY-INDIAN-ART (Undated) _ Thirty years ago, the Philadelphia
Museum of Art presented a ground-breaking exhibition titled
``Unknown India: Ritual Art in Tribe and Village.'' Organized by
the art historian Stella Kramrisch (1896-1993), it brought together
work from outside India's ancient classical traditions. Much has
changed since the 1960s. Qualitative distinctions between fine art
and folk art have been rethought. Vernacular art is taking its
rightful place in elite collections. Maybe that's why the small
exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum until Feb. 3, ``Threads of
Cotton, Threads of Brass: Arts of Eastern India and Bangladesh from
the Stella Kramrisch Collection,'' carries a thrill of delight
rather than a shock of surprise. The show is, in a sense, a reprise
of ``Unknown India'' three decades later and in miniature. By
Holland Cotter. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TELEVISION
</P>
<P>
   TV-DILBERT (Culver City, Calif.) _ If anyone in the television
industry is afraid of corporate downsizing, it is UPN. The
struggling four-year-old broadcaster is widely seen to be on the
verge of eradication after a string of hitless seasons and notable
public relations fiascoes, like last season's ``Secret Diary of
Desmond Pfeiffer,'' a very short-lived alleged Civil War satire.
For public consumption, network officials grit their teeth and deny
it, but it is widely believed in the industry that the success or
failure of ``Dilbert'' an animation show by Scott Adams, will be a
definitive marker of UPN's ultimate _ or, ominously, short-term _
viability. By Andy Meisler. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TV-FAMILY-GUY (Los Angeles) _ One of the things Seth MacFarlane
liked about animation when he was growing up was the way it
elasticized reality. Anvils dropped without consequence and skunks
sang in French, creating a sort of pluperfect pliability where he
could retreat from a world in which people treated him, shockingly,
like a child and enter one where he was in complete control. There,
in the manner of a visiting deity, he spoke for everyone, he had
all the money in the world, and a thought never entered anyone's
head that he didn't put there. This was, of course, perfect
training for Hollywood, where MacFarlane _ now 25, but still
growing _ remains in almost complete control of the new world he
has created: an animated half-hour comedy called ``Family Guy''
that will have its premiere on Fox next Sunday following the Super
Bowl. By Bruce Newman. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TV-FUTURAMA (Santa Monica, Calif.) _ Matt Groening, 44, the
creator of the ``Simpsons'' is preparing to introduce a new series
called ``Futurama.'' The series is scheduled for a March premiere
on Fox. ``Futurama'' is set in the year 3000 in New New York City,
which is built atop the ruins of the original New York. By Anita
Gates. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-COMEDY (Moscow) _ It's not hard to make fun of what is
happening in Russia these days. New jokes about the new rich (now
the new poor after last summer's sudden financial crisis) are
posted on the Internet. President Boris Yeltsin's fumbling speech
is always an easy laugh. There may be more comedy routines about
bank failures than there are solvent banks in Russia. But real
humor _ the deep, biting, funny-sad satire that makes Russians
laugh, usually at themselves _ has become rarer, or at least so
says Mikhail Zhvanetsky, the country's premier stand-up comedian
and humor writer. By Celestine Bohlen. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   NY-RUSSIAN-COMEDIANS (New York) _ Everyone's a comedian. Wander
along the boardwalk in Brighton Beach, as a team of young immigrant
comics does for their twice-monthly television show. Shove a
microphone at any ordinary-looking guy in a fur hat. Has he got a
joke for you? Has he got a joke for you! Humor, the elixir that
helped relieve the aches and pains of life in the former Soviet
Union, has survived the Russian immigrants' voyage to Brooklyn. Not
only are the streets filled with wags; the Russian newspapers are
filled with page after page of jokes. The Russian-language
television and radio station, WMNB, broadcasts two locally produced
comedy shows. Transplanted Russian comics work the private-party
circuit, while the most successful of the New York City immigrant
troupes, Kanotiye, fills the 600-seat National restaurant in
Brooklyn every time the group opens a new variety show. By Susan
Sachs. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   ANTIQUES
</P>
<P>
   MEDIEVAL-ARCADE-ANTIQUES (New York) _ A few months ago, Ward and
Co., New York dealers of ancient and medieval art, sent out a
lavish, fold-out booklet of photographs to display some of the rare
objects from its collection. Most of the objects were from
prehistoric or classical times, but an arresting one was from the
medieval world: an arcade, or arch, from a 12th-century Romanesque
choir screen from the church of the Abbey of Cluny in Burgundy.
This architectural fragment was enticing because it conjured up an
entire structure yet stood on its own as a piece of sculpture. By
Paula Deitz. (Moved). Photo.

U.N. SEEKS TALKS ON FUTURE OF ITS ANGOLA MISSION
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Trying to save a beleaguered mission in Angola,
the Security Council called Thursday for talks with the Angolan
government on the mission's future. The government recently resumed
fighting with an entrenched rebel movement and appears to want the
United Nations to get out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting between the government of President Jose Eduardo
dos Santos and the rebels of the Unita movement, led by Jonas
Savimbi, has made the diplomatic work of the United Nations in
Angola all but impossible, and has led Secretary- General Kofi
Annan to recommend this week that the mission be wound down.
</P>
<P>
   The activities of U.N. aid agencies in Angola are also in
question, after two relief planes were shot down earlier this month
and large areas of the country made unreachable because of
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever happens, our basic working conditions won't change,''
said Sergio Vieira de Mello, the undersecretary-general in charge
of coordinating emergency relief. He told reporters Wednesday that
there are now at least 1.5 million Angolans displaced by fighting,
land mines are being laid everywhere and aid workers are already
confined to provincial capitals, unable to reach many people who
need their help.
</P>
<P>
   De Mello, who fears for the safety of his aid workers, does not
have to wait for Security Council approval to withdraw them. But
Annan cannot shut down all other political or military operations
without a Security Council resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats say that the secretary-general is unwilling to leave
the United Nations in the middle of another mission doomed to
failure because of a Security Council resolution, and then see the
blame fall on the organization and not on the member countries of
the Council, which created the situation. As a former head of the
peacekeeping department, Annan has seen this happen repeatedly, in
Bosnia and in other African conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   But a majority of nations on the Security Council, which has
until late February to make a final decision on the fate of the
U.N. Observer Mission in Angola, want to continue trying to forge
some kind of workable political solution for the country, which has
been in a state of civil war for decades except for two periods of
truce.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and the United States, working with Portugal _ the former
colonial power and until this month a Security Council member _
produced in response to Annan a statement stressing the ``great
importance'' the council attaches to what it calls a
``multidisciplinary presence of the United Nations,'' a
deliberately vague description allowing almost anything the
Angolans might accept. Annan had proposed leaving behind only a
small force to guard property and see other officials off safely.
</P>
<P>
   The United States pressed hard for continuity. Unlike other
council members, the Americans are required to notify Congress when
new missions are proposed, and this would limit their flexibility
here if one mission ended and another had to be created later,
other diplomats said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Soderberg, the U.S. representative on the Security Council
who deals with the Angola issue, said Thursday that the statement
just issued did not dispute the secretary-general's assessment, but
only left the door open for other options.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statement adopted today by the Security Council
underscores the grave concerns of the United Nations over the
deterioration of the situation in Angola,'' Ms. Soderberg said in
an interview. ``The U.N. stands ready to continue to assist Angola
in appropriate ways during this difficult period.''

LYCOS DOWNPLAYS MERGER TALKS REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lycos Inc. is downplaying a report that it is discussing a
billion-dollar partnership with a major media company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had interest from partners as long as we've been in
business,'' said Lycos chief executive officer Bob Davis. ``This is
more of the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis was reacting to a report in Britain's Financial Times
newspaper that said Lycos was looking to sell up to 20 percent of
itself for as much as $1 billion. Davis stressed that partnership
discussions have not yet borne fruit, and that he has no interest
in selling Lycos outright.
</P>
<P>
   The Financial Times story helped kick off a wild day of trading
in Lycos stock. After closing Wednesday at 104 13/16 on Nasdaq ,
Lycos opened at 113 Thursday . But the stock was soon buffeted by a
general selloff of Internet stocks, and fell as low as 105.
However, as the day wore on, Lycos shares recovered and ended the
day at 117, up 12 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos is one of the hottest properties in today's market for
Internet stocks. Born as an Internet search service at Carnegie
Mellon University in Pittsburgh &UR;  &LR; and now based in Waltham, Mass.,
it has built up a stable of popular Internet sites offering free
Web pages, free electronic mail and name and address lookup, among
other services.
</P>
<P>
   According to figures released earlier this week by the market
research firm of Media Metrix Inc., 46.5 percent of all Internet
users visited a Lycos-owned Web site last month. Only sites run by
America Online (AOL), Microsoft and Yahoo boast higher figures.
</P>
<P>
   But both AOL and Microsoft are industry titans in their own
right, and Yahoo's $26.6 billion market capitalization means that
few companies could afford to buy it . Lycos, with a market
capitalization of $4.7 billion, is still cheap by Internet
standards.
</P>
<P>
   So industry watchers keep waiting for a big deal that would make
Lycos part of a larger media or telecommunications company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advantages presented to Lycos by partnering, merging or
getting acquired by a traditional media company far outweigh the
advantages the company has built up in the market to date,'' said
Ron Rappaport, an analyst with Zona Research Inc. in Redwood City,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Rappaport thinks that CBS Inc. is an especially likely partner
or purchaser. Rival television networks NBC and ABC already have
interests in major Internet portals _ NBC owns a stake in CNet's
Snap service, while the Walt Disney Co., parent of ABC, just
launched its Go service. A deal with Lycos lets CBS keep up with
the Joneses.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Williams, analyst with Volpe Brown Whelan &AMP; Co., likes
Time Warner Inc.'s chances with Lycos. ``They need a major US
company that can provide them with a lot of promotion visibility
and ideally, high-speed internet access,'' Not only does Time
Warner own the Cable News Network and a slew of other media
properties, but it also operates a cable television network which
is being upgraded to deliver high-speed Internet access to millions
of homes.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A coalition of senators from both parties, led by
Sen. Bob Graham of Florida and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, met
Thursday to announce a major push for legislation that would
prohibit the federal government from claiming portions of state
tobacco settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Some states already have begun receiving the first big chunks of
their multibillion-dollar awards for participating in a massive
lawsuit against the tobacco industry. Last year, big tobacco agreed
to divide $246 billion among the 50 states to repay them for health
care costs associated with treating smokers.
</P>
<P>
   But Florida, which had settled its own suit for $11 billion
before the others, was notified late last year that the federal
Health Care Financing Administration intended to withhold part of
the bulk Medicaid payment owed the state because it would be
getting the tobacco settlement award.
</P>
<P>
   Graham responded to that threat by introducing a bill to
prohibit the federal government from claiming any of the tobacco
money, but it failed to pass before Congress adjourned last year.
On Thursday, Graham and Hutchison joined with senators from Ohio,
Indiana and Washington to say a multi-force effort was beginning to
reintroduce that bill.
</P>
<P>
   They argued that the federal government declined to help states
make their case against tobacco when the suit was being contested.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be unseemly now at the end of the process for the
federal government to try to recoup'' some of the money, Graham
said.
</P>
<P>
   Also present at the news conference announcing the bill were two
state attorneys general _ one from Ohio, the other from Washington
_ who vowed that they would file suits against the federal
government ``the first time a penny'' is deducted from normal
Medicaid payments.
</P>
<P>
   The group was not swayed by a recent decision by the health care
agency that it won't pursue the money this year, or President
Clinton's announcement during his State of the Union address
Tuesday night that he intends to have the federal government sue
the tobacco industry itself.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison said flatly that Congress can't rely on promises that
the state money will be left alone. ``It's still an open question
and we want to close it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some states have not yet received their first settlement
payments, but Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, said the looming
threat of having up to half of it claimed by the federal government
is going to keep states from budgeting its use.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these funds are going to be held in an escrow account
doing nothing,'' until the federal claim to the cash is resolved,
said Voinovich. ``The sooner we can get this legislation passed,
the sooner we can unleash these funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on Thursday, U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno said the
Justice Department will create a task force to follow through on
Clinton's lawsuit announcement.
</P>
<P>
   But any overtures by the federal government to be turning away
from their previous claims to the state's settlement money are
being greeted with skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be unwise to be lulled into a false sense of security
on this,'' Graham said.

PAKISTAN DENIES CONNECTION TO SUSPECT IN U.S. CONSULATE BOMB PLOT 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 - NYT   By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ The chief Pakistani diplomat here Thursday
denied that a Bangladeshi arrested here and accused of plotting to
bomb U.S. consulates in Madras and Calcutta was a Pakistani
intelligence agent, as the police have charged.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomat, Ashraf Qazi, the Pakistani high commissioner, said
the idea that Pakistan would participate in a terrorist attack on
U.S. missions was ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pakistan and the United States have a perfectly good
relationship,'' Qazi said. ``Our prime minister has recently
completed a productive tour of the United States. We have ongoing
talks at the highest level. It's nothing short of madness to
suggest that any part of the Pakistani government would involve
themselves in such an enterprise.''
</P>
<P>
   This week the United States sent a team of counterterrorism
experts here to investigate the police charges, as well as a
possibility that Osama bin Laden, the terrorist at the top of
Washington's most-wanted list, may have been involved.
</P>
<P>
   Security officials from the embassy met the suspect, Sayed Abu
Nasir, 27, in the 11 days that the police interrogated him. The
U.S. team that arrived on Tuesday is expected to interview Nasir
further, after he has been transferred to the police in the state
of West Bengal for additional questioning.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials were unwilling to discuss the impressions that
their investigators have formed or whether they independently could
corroborate the acts that the police say he has confessed to or
even to specify which federal agencies have joined the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The counterterrorism team is coming to determine the
credibility of the charges made,'' a spokeswoman for the embassy,
Donna Roginski, said. ``If the charges are true they are very, very
serious, and you need to consider them carefully. But you've got to
determine how reliable they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Nasir was arrested on Jan. 7 at the train station. The police
say he was carrying more than four pounds of explosives and had
traveled here planning to set off explosions in crowded public
spaces. Three others have been arrested in West Bengal in the case.
Six additional suspects, from Egypt, Myanmar and Sudan, are at
large.
</P>
<P>
   Nasir has been charged with waging war on India. The police say
he has confessed to spying on Indian military operations, as well
as to planning the attacks on U.S. consulates that the police say
were foiled by his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Nasir, the police added, contends that he met bin Laden once
several years ago while Nasir was in training at a camp in
Afghanistan. The police said Nasir was working with an Islamic
fundamentalist terrorist group at the behest of his handler in
Pakistani intelligence on bombing the consulates.
</P>
<P>
   Nasir and the six at large suspects slipped into India from
Bangladesh in October and spent time in both Madras and Calcutta,
examining the consulates for vulnerable areas, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Qazi said the Indians were trying to smear Pakistan with
baseless charges. The two countries have been deeply hostile to
each other since the subcontinent was divided into India and
Pakistan in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   ``There appears to be,'' Qazi said, ``a deliberate attempt to
sow misunderstanding between Pakistan and a very good friend, the
United States.''

NO EVIDENCE YET OF MIRACLE IN COMATOSE GIRL, PRELATE SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WORCESTER, Mass. _ Wondrous signs that believers link to a
bedridden girl here _ oil-oozing statues, blood-stained Communion
wafers, conquered fatal illnesses _ are deep mysteries, not divine
miracles, a Roman Catholic church panel reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In the matter of 15-year-old Audrey Marie Santo, the church said
in a preliminary report, only faith, so far, can supply answers
that science has yet to fathom.
</P>
<P>
   That is the core of the church's early conclusions in the case
of Santo, who lies in a coma-like state in the back room of a
cream-colored home here, where hundreds say they have found God's
special intercession.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not yet been able to confirm claims of miraculous
events occurring at Audrey's home or as a result of a visit to
Audrey, or from the oils associated with her,'' said Worcester
Bishop Daniel P. Reilly during a press conference Thursday at which
he delicately implored Catholics not to unreasonably seek tangible
proof of heaven on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Delivering the diocese's preliminary findings of a 14-month
investigation into what true believers call miracles linked to the
girl who has been inert and uncommunicative since August 1987 when
she nearly drowned in her family's swimming pool, Reilly said
Catholics may pray for Audrey _ but not to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Praying to Audrey it not acceptable in Catholic teaching,''
said Reilly, releasing a report that also found that there has been
no corroboration of family member's claims that the girl is able to
communicate.
</P>
<P>
   The report also found no ``obvious evidence of chicanery.''
</P>
<P>
   The bishop said the Santo family has agreed to restrict access
to Audrey, who attracted an estimated 10,000 people from across the
United States last summer during a special Mass at an athletic
field at the College of the Holy Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly called that a ``spectacle'' that should not be repeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like coming to a football game or something,'' the bishop
said. ``I object to bringing Audrey out in that sort of box that
they brought her in. I don't think that does any good. And I was
kind of unhappy about that, to be honest with you. I don't like to
see this child used in that way.''
</P>
<P>
   While the church's probe will continue, investigators said
Thursday that its ultimate conclusion may never confirm that
miracles occurred in the back room of the girl's home here on a
dead-end street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some questions will be answerable, but in the final
analysis it may be simply a matter of faith,'' said Dr. John P.
Madonna, a member of the diocesan commission.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly said Santo's family has been cooperative in the church's
investigation. A spokeswoman for the family, who distributed
prepared statements from the front steps of the Santo's ranch-style
home Thursday, said Audrey's condition remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bishop and our pastor and priests will continue to guide
us in the most unusual gift God has given us,'' the family's
statement said. ``The most profound gift, second only to the
Eucharist, is our child _ alive and well and living at home.''
</P>
<P>
   That child _ the youngest of four children _ has become the
object of national attention, drawing a remarkably long waiting
list of people who want to visit the girl some say is responsible
for miracles like those that occurred in Lourdes, France, in 1858
or in Fatima, Portugal, in 1917.
</P>
<P>
   While the church has deemed genuine the miracles at Lourdes and
Fatima, it far from doing that in the case of Audrey who some say
has at time carried the stigmata, or the wounds Christ suffered
during His crucifixion. At least four times, family members have
said, blood has appeared on the Communion hosts consecrated during
Masses at the Santo home.
</P>
<P>
   Madonna said prelimary findings show the blood on the wafers was
human blood of an unknown type. He said it did not match any family
members.
</P>
<P>
   As for the oil coming from statutes, he said: ``(We) looked
behind pictures and we picked up statues and we tried to determine
what was really promoting the emission of fluids. And we found
nothing that we could consider trickery.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators planned controlled tests and laboratory analysis
of religious articles and oils as part of the probe's second stage.
They said they found no evidence that the family has sought
financial gain from the attention Audrey has drawn. ``Staged or
planned manipulation of the visitors to the house is not
apparent,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he believed miracles are occurring through Audrey,
Reilly replied: ``The question is do you believe? Believe in what?
Do you believe that miracles are taking place? ... Do you believe
that blood is appearing in the consecrated host? Do you believe
that people are being healed? I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   But those who have been near her bedside and said they have seen
the miracles with their own eyes, were not as reticent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen Audrey a lot and I see what's going on down there,''
said Patricia Benicaso of Paxton. ``In my mind, I believe
everything. It's going to take a long time for people to accept it.
Whether there are miracles or not, we believe in Audrey. She's
bringing people back to Jesus _ back to Communion _ and that's
what's important. People leave her with peace of mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The further study of the case, authorized by Reilly, will
include sophisticated analysis of fluids and tests to determine
whether Audrey responds to outside stimuli.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Stephen Pedone, the diocese's judicial vicar, said the
Catholic Church has just ``a handful'' of such investigations under
way. He said Pope John Paul II revised church protocol in the
mid-1980s to allow modern medicine and science to be used to
determine whether the laws of nature have been suspended in some
instances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the church begins an investigation, it really takes its
time,'' Pedone said. ``We think in terms of hours and sound-bites.
The church thinks in terms of centuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly said human nature explains the desire by some to confirm
what others take on faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go right back to the Gospel and to Saint Thomas who got
stuck with the name `The Doubter' because he said, `Unless I see
the marks of the nail and the wound in the side, I will not
believe.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And the Lord said to him: `Thomas, blessed are those who have
not seen and have believed.' ''

HOLT FAMILY SELLS WEB-SITE TOY BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Looking to exploit the recent fervor for Internet retailers, the
former chief executive of the Holt Co. said Thursday he has
purchased the company's Web-site toy business from the Holt family
for an undisclosed amount.
</P>
<P>
   David Lord promptly renamed the Internet portion of the
business, toysmart.com, and signed a deal to sell educational toys
at Disney's on-line store as well as at its own new Web site, which
is set to go into operation Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Lord said he bought the business with venture capital funding
from Zero Stage Capital of Cambridge, Mass. and a debt line from
Imperial Bank's Boston office. While the Holt family retains a
percentage of toysmart.com., the family-controlled Holt Co. of
Waltham, Mass. will continue to operate its school supplies and
video conferencing businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need a lot of financing to build a significant brand''
online, said Lord, explaining his strategy for toysmart.com.
</P>
<P>
   Not only were more resources required to market the business,
but also to expand its capacity, he said. For all of 1997, Holt had
Internet sales of $200,000. In December 1998 alone, Internet sales
grew to $1 million, Lord said.
</P>
<P>
   This rapid growth was the reason for spinning toysmart.com off
from Holt and looking for outside financing.
</P>
<P>
   A second round of venture capital funding is alreay underway
with a goal of raising $6 million, Lord said.
</P>
<P>
   To help market toysmart.com, Lord has signed up William Sears as
a consultant. A physician who aims to be the Dr. Spock of the
millennium, Sears hosts a cable TV show on parenting on the Pax
network. Plans call for toysmart to market itself on the show.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Sears, Lord has been signing up scores of teachers as
toysmart.com consultants. Like Sears, they'll write articles that
will appear at toysmart.com's Web site. The goal is to make the
toysmart.com the premier online community and information-resource
for parents, Lord said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to wrap products around the content,'' said Lord.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most successful e-commerce retailers has been eToys,
which Lord describes as a sort of on-line Toys ``R'' Us.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, toysmart will stay away from such mainstream toys
as Barbie and Star Wars action figures, instead focusing on
educational toys made by companies like Brio, Playmobil, and K'nex.
</P>

NEWSMAN WALLACE TESTIFIES FOR FORMER ASSOCIATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It's been his stock in trade during his decades on ``60
Minutes,'' the tale of the little guy fighting the system, the man
unjustly accused.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday veteran CBS newsman Mike Wallace, sans camera crew,
took that finely-honed affinity for the underdog into federal
court, where he testified on behalf of a former ``60 Minutes''
consultant who is representing himself in a case against Harvard
University.
</P>
<P>
   Called as a character witness by Kaveh L. Afrasiabi, who is
suing a Harvard Police detective and two former employees of the
school's Center for Middle Eastern Studies for his arrest and
imprisonment in January 1996, Wallace spoke warmly of the
Iranian-American scholar he first contacted in 1990 after seeing a
letter he had written to the New York Times on the situation in
Iran.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Wallace was planning to do a ``60 Minutes'' segment
on the death threat issued against author Salman Rushdie by the
Iranian government for what it viewed as his blasphemous
characterization of Islam in his novel ``The Satanic Verses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire Afrasiabi,'' testified Wallace. ``I admire his
persistence in this matter. I think he's an honorable man. There's
no doubt in my mind that he is an Islamic scholar of considerable
repute. I think he's gone through hard times with this matter. And
I think he's innocent enough to think he's going to prevail against
the resources of Harvard University.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, outside the courtroom, Wallace said he would have felt
``like a heel,'' if he hadn't helped Afrasiabi. Calling his story
of false arrest and imprisonment, ``a wonderful tale,'' Wallace
said, ``The cannons of Harvard are lined up against a guy with a
peashooter.''
</P>
<P>
   Afrasiabi, 40, of Needham, was equally effusive in his praise of
Wallace. In a letter he read to the jury, Afrasiabi pitched the
idea of Hollywood doing a movie on the life of Wallace, who he
called ``a cultural icon.'' In the same letter, Afrasiabi asked him
for ``a great favor.'' Could he introduce him to Kirk Douglas?
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the case is the arrest of Afrasiabi before dawn
on Jan. 17, 1996, more than two months after Shobhana Rana, a
student assistant at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies, and
Reza Alavi, a research associate who later became her
father-in-law, reported a bizarre threat and extortion scheme to
Harvard police.
</P>
<P>
   After Alavi found a threatening note tucked under the door of
his apartment in November 1995, Rana acknowledged that a man had
twice demanded money from her in September, ordering her to
withdraw the money from Alavi's account or he would be harmed.
</P>
<P>
   When interviewed by Harvard police, Rana picked a photograph of
Afrasiabi out of an array of eight pictures. And Alavi told police
that Afrasiabi had left a ``hostile'' message on his answering
machine a few months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But Rana failed to identify Afrasiabi during a probable cause
hearing and the charges were dropped in April 1996. He had spent
eight days in jail in January before he was released on bail.
</P>
<P>
   Afrasiabi, who was a post-doctoral fellow at the Center for
Middle Eastern Studies from July 1989 to June 1990, claims his
false arrest was part of a conspiracy by his political enemies at
Harvard to discredit him.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, he produced a letter that the center's director,
Roy T. Mottahedeh, sent to Wallace in September 1990, in which
Mottahedeh said Afrasiabi had misrepresented himself to Wallace.
Mottahedeh said Afrasiabi was not a post-doctoral fellow at Harvard
but merely a ``faculty associate,'' a courtesy status given him
because he was teaching at nearby Northeastern.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said the letter ``brought me up short'' and made him
wonder about Afrasiabi's credentials. A letter from Mottahedeh to
Afrasiabi just 2 1/2 months before welcoming him as a faculty
associate for the 1990-91 academic year confused things even more,
Wallace acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``One was absolutely opposite in nature and intent from the
other,'' said Wallace, who concluded that Mottahedeh's letter to
him was ``a flat-out lie.''

COMMENTARY: THE LAST DAYS
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By A.M. ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Then, when the screening was over and everybody in the theater
sat in sick and total silence, nobody moving, I knew I could not
write another column, nor want to, not about the president, or the
trial, not about terrorism or Iraq, or about poor people or rich
people, or anything else, until I wrote about what we had just seen
and had asked myself again whether it proved that there was no God
or proved that there was, or proved nothing, the most terrifying
thought of all.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I was a resident reporter in Poland only 13 years after the
Germans lusted for one last orgasm of hate and ordered as many Jews
as possible killed before Allied troops could rescue them.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So what could I write about ``The Last Days,'' Steven
Spielberg's new documentary, that I had not written before, I
thought. Then I realized that for so many, witnessing the witnesses
turns into a mark of prayer _ a canvas, a book, money or time to
the suffering and persecuted. And all, including journalists, may
pray for the dead of the camps however often the need takes them,
and leave whatever mark they can express. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg is executive producer; the producers are Ken Lipper
and June Beallor. I think the film is the prayer-mark of all who
made it, Jew and Christian _ including interviewers, and
technicians who recorded witnesses in color and found in the
computers the pieces of German black-and-white film that show what
five Hungarian survivors saw and suffered. It will open in New York
on Feb. 5. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We think we know all about the Holocaust; we never will. We did
not know about Irene Zisblatt or her face as she talks of the
Auschwitz dungeon she was put in with other women awaiting
``experimental'' surgery of Nazi doctors. Day after day they stood,
existing without food or light.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They did have water. They drank the water they stood in, and in
which they had to defecate.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We had not seen the German doctor Hans Munch saying that having
concentration camps was a ``thankful'' thing for doctors who
desired an endless supply of women whose breasts and reproductive
organs could be sliced or injected, to see what would happen.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This Munch was tried, and went free, he says, because he
subjected some prisoners to less devastating experimentations, thus
preventing them from being incinerated at once. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We did not know about the three teen-age boys who swore they
would always stick together. When one stumbled and fell in a march,
and was to be shot on the spot, the two others put themselves in
front of him. A guard lifted his rifle and gave them both three
seconds to move. They did, and Bill Basch still weeps at their
friend's execution. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Renee Firestone saw 20 male prisoners walking in file at
Auschwitz. Her father was among them. She crouched, because she did
not want him to see her, shaven head and with a rag to cover her.
But he did, his last glimpse of his daughter.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Alice Lok Cahana sometimes murmured the Sabbath chants with
other women prisoners. Decades later, we see her with her two
American sons, rabbis, showing them the latrine _ open holes in the
ground. The women hid there to perform the ceremony. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More than 600,000 Americans know Tom Lantos, in the California
district where he was elected a Democratic member of the House of
Representatives. Like the others he says they knew what was going
on in Germany but thought _ not in Hungary, Hungarians would never
do that, not to patriotic Hungarians, like the Jews.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Did you ever see the picture of the town being taken by two Nazi
motorcyclists? Or of the townspeople cheering on Nazi
reinforcements and screaming that now the Jews would get theirs?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Did you know Paul Parks, an African-American with U.S.
liberation troops, now a doctor? He approached a German, who spat
in his face.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I killed him,'' says Dr. Parks, ``so that he could not do that
to anybody else.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But do not go see the picture to see ``new'' things. Go to see
again what you know _ the living skeletons with nothing but skin
and bones on their buttocks and thighs, the dead skeletons filling
scores of boxcars because the Nazis wanted them dead before U.S.
troops could give them life. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The film allows us to see and remember, if we so choose. The
fact of the choice will not answer all the God questions, but it
might help.

CLINTON LAWYERS ENSURE BIPARTISAN SPLIT IN VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's defenders presented such a
vigorous case that it will almost certainly strip away any veneer
of bipartisanship in the next stage of the impeachment trial,
political and legal observers agreed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   They said the White House lawyers had probably ensured that
nearly all Democrats will vote to end the trial without calling
witnesses _ but seemingly didn't persuade enough Republicans to
secure a majority. So, when the ballots are counted next week for
dismissal and for calling witnesses, the analysts predicted a sharp
party-line divide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, that's what's going to happen,'' said Victoria
Toensing, a former Justice Department official in the Reagan
administration who is highly critical of Clinton. ``The president's
people did, quite effectively, what any good litigators are
supposed to do . . . and what the House prosecutors also did well:
Give those who want to vote for you some reason to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   While the analysts gave the defense team high marks for both
style and substance, they said an accident of timing had permitted
Clinton to serve as his own most powerful advocate.
</P>
<P>
   He gave his State of the Union address on the same day his
lawyers began their presentation, effectively allowing the
president to speak to his jurors _ in Congress and in the American
public _ without facing hostile questioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more than any defense attorney's wildest dream,'' said
Max Stern, a prominent Boston defense attorney. ``Not only isn't he
cross-examined, but he gets to define the issue: `I am the
president, look how good a job I'm doing.' . . . It was quite an
extraordinary situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Hirschhorn, a Texas-based jury consultant who assisted
prosecutors in the Whitewater case in Arkansas, said Clinton had
especially helped his case by addressing the ``bigger jury'' of
American voters. ``When he pitches to himself, he can hit a home
run like nobody else,'' said Hirschhorn.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the president's poll numbers soared in the wake of his
speech, and the analysts said that would add considerable pressure
on senators to speed up a resolution to his trial, even if they
don't end it yet.
</P>
<P>
   Some suggested a plausible exit strategy for Republicans, wary
of constituent backlash but unwilling to look like they were bested
by Clinton, might go like this: Vote for calling witnesses, who
would then be deposed in private. If they provide no revelations
that could bolster the prosecution case, then shut down the trial,
saying the Senate had done its duty by going through the entire
legal process before rendering a judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Even without the president's participation, his defense lawyers
did more than just solidify his Democratic base.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans in Congress praised the White House attorneys'
performance and said they may have raised doubts about specific
instances of Clinton's alleged perjury and obstruction of justice.
And the legal specialists agreed, saying the defense strategy of
offering a detailed rebuttal on the facts _ rather than focusing
only on whether the charges rise to the level of impeachable
offenses _ had proved very effective, though it was risky because
it virtually invited the calling of witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House managers tried to show that the whole was much
greater than the sum of the parts, by demonstrating a pattern of
behavior by the president. But the defense was able to poke holes
in that case. . . by using the legal strategy of dissection to show
that the whole, in fact, was less than it might have seemed,'' said
Jeffrey Abramson, a professor of political and legal studies at
Brandeis University and author of ``We the Jury: The Jury System
and the Ideal of Democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The analysts said the defense team had also made muscular
arguments against calling witnesses, something the White House is
loathe to do because it wants to minimize the possibility of
surprises. Clinton's lawyers confronted that issue partly by
stressing that nothing new was likely to emerge from live
testimony, but also by essentially threatening to call witnesses
whose demeanor and words might not serve the prosecutors' cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Linda Tripp is the most reviled character in this whole drama
. . . and they made it clear the Republicans would have to deal
with people like her if they call witnesses,'' said Stern. ``That's
quite a risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the assessments of the experts, who agreed that the
House managers had done a good job of prosecuting their case, was a
consensus that the battle between the lawyers turned out to be a
mismatch.
</P>
<P>
   The White House attorneys, the political and legal specialists
said, were some of the best litigators in the country, who
demonstrated how they had earned their reputations and why they
command huge salaries in the private sector. They helped their
cause by offering more concise and sharply worded arguments, and by
dividing the speaking roles among fewer and more-polished
presenters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sort of the difference between watching the amateur
hour and the professional hour,'' said Bruce Yannett, a defense
attorney in New York who served as a prosecutor in the Iran-contra
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Toensing, while stressing that she thought the case against
Clinton remained compelling, agreed. She said the Republican
prosecutors had tried unsuccessfully to hire outside attorneys to
present at least some of their arguments, and might try again to do
so when deposing witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately,'' said Toensing, ``the House managers had to
face highly paid professionals.''

ZIMBABWE JOURNALISTS CLAIM TO HAVE BEEN TORTURED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Two Zimbabwean journalists,
arrested for reporting last week about a reported coup plot by the
army against President Robert Mugabe, were released on bail
Thursday after they told a judge that they had been tortured while
detained.
</P>
<P>
   The journalists, who work for The Sunday Standard, said they had
been beaten, given electric shocks on the hands, feet and genitals
and nearly suffocated by having their heads submerged in drums of
water, a torture known as ``the submarine.''
</P>
<P>
   The journalists, Mark Chavunduka, 34, and Ray Choto, 36, had
cigarette burns on their bodies when they appeared in court in
Harare, capital of Zimbabwe. They were released on $250 bail and
told to appear in court again on Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
   The publisher of The Standard, Clive Wilson, said the
journalists had been tortured to make them divulge their sources
for reporting that 23 soldiers were arrested on Dec. 17 on charges
of inciting other soldiers to overthrow Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is absolutely disgraceful,'' Wilson said. ``It's like
something out of Nazi Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Mugabe has reacted with increasingly authoritarian rule
against opposition, the reporters' treatment has been unusually
harsh. The small opposition press in Zimbabwe is usually left
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe has faced protests because of the failing economy and
because of his decision last year to send 8,000 soldiers to Congo
to help prop up President Laurent Kabila. At one point there were
widespread rumors of mutinies among the soldiers, which the
government denied. Soon after, however, soldiers were given a large
pay raise.
</P>
<P>
   The government has also denied that there was any truth to the
report in The Standard about the coup attempt. But on Saturday the
army posted reinforcements, including troops with machine guns,
around its headquarters in Harare. The guard outside Mugabe's
official residence was also bolstered.
</P>
<P>
   Chavunduka, editor of The Standard, was arrested by the military
police last week and held for days at an army base. When lawyers
for the paper obtained an order from the High Court for his
release, military officials at first refused to free him, saying
the court did not have jurisdiction in army matters.
</P>
<P>
   But after the court had threatened to arrest the defense
minister, Chavunduka was taken to the central police station, where
on Tuesday he was allowed to see his family and lawyers. At that
point, he said, he had been treated well.
</P>
<P>
   Choto, who wrote the article on the coup attempt, had at first
avoided arrest by hiding, but turned himself in on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the lawyers for The Standard said, the two men
disappeared from the police station after their families had left.
One lawyer, Erik Morris, told the court that the men were then
tortured, not by the police but ``by certain forces of the
Zimbabwean government.'' He did not give details.
</P>
<P>
   At various points the two were stripped, blindfolded, beaten and
forced to roll on wet grass to clean off blood, their lawyers said.
Wilson said the journalists had also been asked to name everyone
whom they knew in the army.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of publishing falsified information ``likely to
cause fear, alarm and despondency,'' the two could be jailed for up
to seven years.
</P>
<P>
   In neighboring South Africa, The South African Union of
Journalists condemned the treatment of the two as ``reprehensible
and intolerable.''

AIRLINES PLAN FARE RESTRICTIONS FOR YEAR-2000-RELATED TRAVEL
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many passengers planning to fly first class or full-fare coach
over the Christmas holidays in December or to and from events
welcoming in the year 2000 will find their tickets are
nonrefundable on United Airlines and Delta Air Lines.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines said it was studying whether to impose similar
restrictions, and other carriers were likely to follow the lead of
United and Delta as well.
</P>
<P>
   The restrictions will be effective from Dec. 16, 1999, through
Jan. 10, 2000, and will cover popular destinations like New York,
Miami, Orlando, New Orleans, Phoenix, Las Vegas, Hawaii and several
ski resorts. Similar restrictions will apply on certain
international flights, not all of which have been determined but
which are certain to include flights to London, Paris and Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic tickets must be paid for within 24 hours of making
reservations (48 hours in the case of Hawaii) and 14 days for
international flights.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines and United Airlines posted their restrictions
Wednesday in their computerized reservations systems, which list
flight schedules up to 11 months in advance. They were discovered
by Terry Trippler, editor of The Airfare Report, an industry
newsletter, who sent an advisory to newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   While the dates selected will encompass the holidays, they are
actually directed at year 2000-related travel, the airlines said,
and are similar to restrictions they imposed for the 1996 Summer
Olympics in Atlanta. The purpose then and now, the airlines said,
is to minimize double-booking and no-shows, which penalize others
wanting to make reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``To show you how egregious this sometimes gets,'' said Joe
Hopkins of United, ``somebody called and wanted to book every seat
to Hawaii on every flight on one particular day. That's 10 to 15
flights, and you know nobody's going to fill that many seats.''

SERBIA DECIDES US ENVOY CAN STAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Backing down under international
pressure, Serbia has agreed not to expel the American who leads
human rights monitors in the troubled southern province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In a classic maneuver for Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian
president waited until world leaders such as President Clinton and
British Prime Minister Tony Blair threatened force before his
government decided to ``freeze'' a expulsion order for US
Ambassador William Walker.
</P>
<P>
   And Milosevic refused Thursday to budge on most of the issues
regarding compliance with an Oct. 12 cease-fire between Serb forces
and ethnic Albanian rebels. NATO continued to consider future
action against Serbia, US officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not consider this problem resolved. On the contrary, we
continue to consult with NATO allies about next steps,'' State
Department James Rubin said after the Serbian announcement.
</P>
<P>
   For six days, Walker, chief of the Kosovo Verification Force,
kept world attention fixed on the killing of 45 ethnic Albanians in
a village 15 miles from here. He enraged the Serbian government by
directly blaming Serb security forces, in Kosovo to put down a
nearly yearlong insurgency, for the massacre.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement distributed by the state-run Tanjug news agency,
the government said it would postpone the expulsion order against
Walker until ``the consequences of his behavior are fully
clarified.'' The statement said Serbia was persuaded by appeals on
Walker's behalf by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and Russian
President Boris N. Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Walker remained defiant. It may have been more of a
media event than a monitoring mission, but Walker made his point:
moving into the countryside to investigate human rights abuses on
the day he was supposed to leave _ and being stopped by Serb
forces.
</P>
<P>
   The face-off had all the necessary characters: four burly Serb
police, dressed in their signature purple, camouflage-pattern
uniforms and heavily armed, refusing road passage to the lanky US
ambassador, who is chief of of the Kosovo Verfication Mission.
Walker himself was surrounded six-deep by reporters and cameramen
invited to witness what Serbs had hoped would be Walker's last day
in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are KLA terrorists there. It is not safe,'' one of the
Serb police told Walker, referring to the Kosovo Liberation Army, a
group bent on independence for the southern Serbian province of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what they call compliance,'' Walker said, gesturing
toward the military vehicles and police assembled.
</P>
<P>
   The police would not let Walker past the hilltop checkpoint,
which was controlled by the KLA until a Serb offensive last
December took it back for the ruling Serbs. So Walker _ along with
the 16-vehicle caravan that accompanied him to the northern Kosovo
region _ trudged in the mud back to his day-glow orange vehicle and
went back to headquarters in Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has been threatening air strikes since October, but has
been reluctant to move, despite evidence reported by monitors of
violations of the October cease-fire agreement by both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of a strike say such a bold move is the only thing
that will stop the bloodshed here. But there are also serious
concerns that a strike would strengthen the KLA strategically, and
simply lengthen the conflict. NATO is also skittish about bombing
to solve an internal conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, a KLA commander acknowledged that his forces were
responsible for the shooting and wounding of an international
observer and his translators on Jan. 15. The commander said it was
``due to a misunderstanding,'' the OSCE said. But the organization
condemned ``this deliberate attempt on verifiers' lives,'' and
wants an assurance that those responsible will be punished, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic on Monday demanded that Walker leave after the US
ambassador blamed the Serbs for the Friday carnage near the town of
Racak. His reversal came after Western threats of force _ just as
his agreements did to cease fire in Kosovo in October, after 2,000
deaths, and in Bosnia in 1995, after an estimated 200,000 people
were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs have denied mutilating the bodies, or gunning them
down execution-style. Yugosolav forensics experts who have examined
some of the bodies said the corpses showed no signs of mutilation.
</P>
<P>
   A Finnish team arrived Thursday to begin X-raying the bodies, a
forensics procedure. Against Western wishes, the Serbs had
continued to examine the corpses before the Finnish team arrived.
The Serbs countered that if they interrupted the process, the
bodies would become too decomposed to examine accurately.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of how the Albanians died, and what happened to them
afterward before they ended up strewn on a hillside, has become a
major sticking point here. French media have questioned whether
there was some tampering with the bodies after they died, saying it
was possible that the KLA did some extra damage to the corpses to
make it look like the Serbs have committed a brutal massacre of
local villagers.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs have seized on the French reports, saying that Walker --
derided as a ``liar'' by Serb government and state-controlled media
-- was wrong to describe the murders as an atrocity. At any rate,
the Serbs say, Walker's job is to observe - not to judge.
</P>
<P>
   Walker reiterated Thursday that he had ``corroborative
evidence'' to back up his accusation. Journalists on the scene
where the bodies were found observed that bullet holes in the
victims' clothes matched those on the bodies - against charges by
the Serbs that the bodies were dressed in civilian clothes after
their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting continued Thursday near Mitrovica, north of Pristina.
The village of Shipolje was quiet, and it appeared Serb police had
essentially taken over the Albanian village. Some villagers could
be seen hiding in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-aircraft guns and armored personnel vehicles were stationed
at the border of the village, and police lounged in front of empty
stores. A couple were playing chess in the back of a military
truck, and one armed vehicle had two party balloons attached to it.
</P>
<P>
   Villagers told reporters that seven men were detained and
questioned by Serb police.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were terrorists up there'' in the mountains surrounding
Shipolje, said one Serb policeman, casually smoking a cigarette in
the deserted street. ``But we cleared them out.''

DE KLERK BOOK REWRITES IMAGE OF MANDELA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Speaking of Nelson Mandela, F.W. de Klerk leans
forward, somewhat conspiratorily, and says, ``We're not friends,
you know.''
</P>
<P>
   That becomes clear after reading de Klerk's autobiography, which
was published Wednesday in London. Although Mandela is one of the
most admired men in the world, de Klerk paints a far less
flattering portrait of the man who replaced him as president of
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Last Trek: A New Beginning,'' Mandela comes across as a
petty, petulant man who was not nearly as magnanimous in victory as
widely portrayed. De Klerk's book confirms what many had long
suspected: while de Klerk and Mandela presided together over the
dismantling of apartheid and the creation of democracy in South
Africa, sharing a Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts, they hated
each other.
</P>
<P>
   Although some will see his more caustic remarks about Mandela as
pure sour grapes, de Klerk sees them as providing a more balanced
view of a man whom he says has been turned into a saint by
revisionist historians and simplistic journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, before addressing a group of American journalists in
London, de Klerk took time out for a glass of white wine, more than
one cigarette, and some observations about his country. He says the
press has taken his critical remarks about Mandela out of context.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only excerpts that have been printed are those critical of
Mandela. But I say many good things about him, too,'' de Klerk
insists. ``How could I not? He is a great man.''
</P>
<P>
   But he could be difficult, too, according to de Klerk, whose
candid remarks stand out all the more because Mandela's 1994
autobiography was much more discreet toward de Klerk.
</P>
<P>
   De Klerk says Mandela did not appreciate the risks he took with
white South Africans in 1990 by releasing Mandela after 27 years in
prison and signaling the end of apartheid. Instead, he says,
Mandela tried to humiliate him at nearly every available
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when de Klerk and Mandela first went to the White
House to meet President Clinton in 1993, ``Mandela had flatly
refused to appear with me before the photographers,'' de Klerk
writes. Later, they shared a podium in Philadelphia, where the two
leaders were given an award. De Klerk said Mandela was miffed that
de Klerk's speech got more applause than his.
</P>
<P>
   De Klerk says Mandela routinely criticized him at functions that
were meant to celebrate the change from apartheid to a
black-controlled government, embarrassing their hosts.
</P>
<P>
   He says Mandela tailored his speeches for his audience in South
Africa, telling white businessmen he needed them, but savaging the
same businessmen when he addressed a black gathering. Asked whether
that wasn't just politics, de Klerk shakes his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a need to be conciliatory,'' he says. ``Mandela
disappointed me when he didn't rise to the occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   De Klerk, who retired from politics in 1997, is not the sort of
vanquished politician who predicts doom and gloom. He acknowledges
that crime is worse than ever, that economic growth is not as
robust as expected, and that unemployment is higher than under
apartheid. Yet he sees brighter days.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people say look how bad it is now, I say you have to
consider how bad it would be if we had not dismantled apartheid and
created a democracy,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In an aside, De Klerk thinks Britain's decision to arrest former
Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet on a Spanish warrant charging him
with human rights violations sets a dangerous precedent because it
ignores an agreement approved by Chilean voters that gave Pinochet
amnesty in exchange for democracy. Still, de Klerk said he is not
afraid to travel anywhere, saying, ``I'm no Pinochet.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 62, the former leader looks younger, tanned, and fit. Like
Mandela, he has a new, younger wife. De Klerk says he wants to
establish a foundation that would address the economic and social
challenges facing not only South Africa, but all of sub-Saharan
Africa. And he also wants to work on his golf game and lower his
18-handicap.
</P>
<P>
   Like any first-time author, de Klerk seems to relish that his
book has caused controversy, even while insisting the controversy
takes his book out of context. The reality is that when the book is
published in the United States in March, most people will be
intrigued by his observations about Mandela, not his predecessors
P.W. Botha, John Vorster, and Hendrik Verwoerd.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he had sent an advance copy to Mandela, he
replies, ``No. He didn't send me a copy of his.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he acknowledges looking forward to Mandela's reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will not like the book. He will be cross with me,'' F.W. de
Klerk says, drawing hard on his cigarette before adding, ``Again.''

A LEGENDARY PITCHMAN PROVES THERE'S LIFE AFTER DEATH 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By GREG FARRELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To those who have been watching football on television in recent
weeks, the hottest voice-over talent in corporate America seems to
be John Facenda. He narrates some of the National Football League's
``Feel the Power'' spots, which ran during the playoffs. Voices
that sound like his have been popping up on commercials for
Tostitos tortilla chips, AT&AMP;T and the Sunny Delight juice drink, as
well as on promotions for ``The Late Show With David Letterman'' on
CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Facenda's popularity during the height of the professional
football season should not be a surprise: He made his name as the
longtime narrator for NFL Films. Because of the rich timbre of his
voice, he is revered in some football circles as ``the voice of
God.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing unusual about Facenda's current success as a
corporate pitchman is that he has been dead for almost 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   For Madison Avenue, death is no longer the impediment it used to
be. In the last several years, the Royal Appliance Manufacturing
Co. brought Fred Astaire back to life to dance with a Dirt Devil
vacuum cleaner, the Coca-Cola Co. used James Cagney and Humphrey
Bogart to pitch Diet Coke and the Adolph Coors Co. exhumed John
Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers like Royal Appliance and Coors Light used special
effects wizardry to engineer the reincarnations of Astaire and
Wayne. In the case of Facenda's voice, the NFL made its
appropriation a lot easier by developing a roster of sound-alike
voice-overs to replace him after he died. NFL Films now uses Harry
Kalas, Jeff Kaye and Earl Mann to narrate the league's football
movies. Kalas supplied the voice-over for the AT&AMP;T and Sunny
Delight ads; Kaye did the Tostitos spot, and Mann narrated the
Letterman promotions.
</P>
<P>
   All of these commercials are spoofs that play off the
association of Facenda's masculine, authoritative intonations _
``In driving rain, pro football is played'' _ to make a
light-hearted point. In AT&AMP;T's commercial, the actor Paul Reiser
makes a sandwich and plops into a chair during halftime, while
Kalas thunders, ``When the going gets tough, the tough make phone
calls.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The voice seems to take things so seriously,'' said John
Calquhoun, senior creative director on the AT&AMP;T account at Foote,
Cone &AMP; Belding, New York, a unit of True North Communications. ``It
instantly clues you in to the genre of the sports film. You know
what the joke is and the parody we're going after.''
</P>
<P>
   For Sunny Delight, sold by the Procter &AMP; Gamble Co., N.W. Ayer &AMP;
Partners, a unit of MacManus Group, created a Super Bowl promotion
around an imaginary professional football team, the Anchorage
Otters, reminding viewers that they had as much of a chance to get
to the Super Bowl as the team did. Once again, Kalas' voice-over,
combined with footage of a Vince Lombardi look-alike coaching from
the frosty sidelines, harks back to the time when the legendary
coach led Bart Starr and the Green Bay Packers to a string of
championship titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became a natural to replicate an ageless part of sports
culture, the voice of the NFL,'' said Peter Hubbell, executive vice
president and senior partner at Ayer, adding that Facenda's voice
``is part of the entertainment vernacular, like Jack Webb and Jack
Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It brings nostalgia and a knowing understanding from the
viewer,'' Hubbell said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone appreciates the connection. Bill Heater, chairman
of Heater Advertising in Boston, grew up listening to Facenda.
Before he founded his agency, he was noted not only for his
copywriting skills but for his voice-overs for the John Hancock
Mutual Life Insurance Co. and the Infiniti division of the Nissan
Motor Co..
</P>
<P>
   ``You've taken something good and true and commercialized it,''
Heater said. ``It seems sacrilegious to take his voice and plaster
it over everything. What's next: Harry Caray, Edward R. Murrow and
Charles Kurault?''
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry, insists Howard Handler, senior vice president for
marketing and fan development at NFL Properties in New York. ``The
voice of John Facenda is etched in stone,'' Handler said. ``It
would be almost impossible for someone to sully it.''
</P>
<P>
   The humorous knockoffs ``only reinforce the fact that this voice
means football,'' Handler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It absolutely sets the tone and creates a mood that is
unmistakably football,'' he added. ``If there was a feeding frenzy
of these ads, we might be concerned, but from what we've seen, it
reinforces, rather than dilutes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very flattered,'' said Steve Sabol, president of NFL
Films, based in Mount Laurel, N.J. Sabol and his father, Ed Sabol,
selected Facenda for their first feature, ``They Call It Pro
Football,'' in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny,'' Sabol said, ``but after our ads ran in
September, I got five or six calls from ad agencies, asking, `We'd
like to use the voice you have.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's any danger in mimicking the voice of the NFL,''
warned one brand specialist, ``it's to the imitators, not the
imitated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Brand voice is very much a part of brand identity,'' said
Allen Adamson, managing director of Landor Associates, the brand
identity division of Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc. in New York. Adamson
cites advertisers like the Bell Atlantic Corp. and the Toyota Motor
Co.'s Lexus division as examples of advertisers that recognize the
value of a consistent voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NFL is smart,'' Adamson said. ``If you have a voice that
is the voice of your brand, you should use it consistently. Brands
are about differentiation and relevance.''
</P>

   ``Sometimes an advertiser tampers with the differentiation to be
relevant,'' he continued. ``That short-term, promotional thinking
is not strategically sound. You'll never remember the advertiser
who did the parody. It's better to be true to yourself than to play
the borrowed interest game, which is a short-term game.''

MICROSOFT SUES VENDORS OVER ALLEGED PIRACY

<P>
   Microsoft Corp. filed lawsuits against eight area computer
retailers and vendors, alleging they resold counterfeit programs or
distributed software without permission.
</P>
<P>
   In complaints filed in federal district courts in Boston,
Providence R.I. and Concord, N.H. Thursday, Microsoft seeks
unspecified damages and court orders that the software giant says
are needed to bar the local companies from continuing to violate
copyright and trademark laws.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the defendants denied wrongdoing and said they were
being singled out unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Psyhogeos, attorney for Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft,
said the suits were justified as part of its broader campaign
against software piracy. Microsoft says such counterfeiting
resulted in $604 million in lost retail sales in Massachusetts
alone in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Microsoft filed similar suits against nine computer
resellers in New York and New Jersey. Those actions are still
pending. ``We're trying to get the message out that software piracy
isn't a victimless crime,'' Psyhogeos said.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, Microsoft alleges that counterfeit copies of
its popular Windows operating system, or other programs, were sold
by Horizon Computer of Framingham, Macena Systems Inc. of
Middleton, National Computer Co. of Quincy, CTS Computer Hardware
Discount Inc. of Newton, Corporate Computer Consultants of
Londonderry, N.H., Worldwide Computer Solutions Inc. of Keene,
N.H., and Compusource of Johnston, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also charged that GT Computers Inc. of Woburn, and
several of the other local defendants had also loaded illegitimate
copies of Microsoft programs onto hard disk drives without
permission.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said it targeted the firms after it received tips and
complaints about their activities. Microsoft added that it had
previously reached private agreements with two of the companies, GT
Computers and CTS Computer, to cease alleged trademark violations.
But the activities continued, Microsoft now claims.
</P>
<P>
   Neither GT nor CTS officers could be reached for comment
Thursday. However, other defendants said they had kept careful
records of their purchase and sale orders, which they said showed
that their transactions were legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel I'm guilty of having done anything wrong,'' said
Horizon Computer owner Scott Fine, who says he sells software and
hardware from tables set up at trade shows. ``I think they're
purposely going after people who don't have the resources to fight
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Saad Souleiman owner of Compusource in Rhode Island, also denied
wrongdoing and complained it will cost him $10,000 in legal fees
just to respond to the suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a strategy by Microsoft against the small stores
like us, so they'll be able to control the market,'' Souleiman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Macena, owner of Macena Systems in Middleton, also denied
wrongdoing. Executives at National Computer, Corporate Computer and
Worldwide Computer couldn't be reached for comment.

<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Surrounded by 200 elderly and disabled people and
those who provide care for them at a center for the elderly here,
Vice President Al Gore disclosed details Thursday of the
administration's $6 billion dollar package of tax and budget
proposals for long-term care.
</P>
<P>
   The more expensive of the initiatives is a $750 million
proposal, which represents a 13.6 percent increase over the current
appropriation, to rebuild and modernize public housing for the
elderly to accommodate their specific health needs.
</P>
<P>
   The second measure is intended to extend Medicare benefits to
those who depend upon community-based or home-based services like
day-care workers or occasional nurses. Currently, only people in
need of long-term care who live in nursing homes qualify for those
benefits. Administration officials estimate the cost at $110
million over five years.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also said the administration is proposing a new $1,000
annual tax credit to offset some of the costs incurred by long-term
care givers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day in Orlando, Gore told an audience at a forum
on education that the administration is proposing a 35 percent
budget increase, to $312 million, to accelerate efforts to restore
the Florida Everglades.

<P>
   It has been suggested that males, in our species and others, are
more prone to violence than females.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, despite the current academic bias against genetic
explanations for behavior, this evidence does show that males are
indeed more likely to fight, murder, loot, pillage and, of course,
rape, than females.
</P>
<P>
   The question remains, however, whether this apparently innate
male predilection has much to do with war, international relations
and politics.
</P>
<P>
   In the anthropology of war, there is little basis for locating
the wellspring of war in aggressive male instincts _ or in any
instincts, for that matter. Wars are not barroom brawls writ large,
but, as social theorist Robin Fox puts it, ``complicated,
orchestrated, highly organized'' collective undertakings that
cannot be explained by any individual impulse.
</P>
<P>
   No plausible instinct would impel a man to leave his home, cut
his hair short and drill for hours under the hot sun. As
anthropologists Clifton B. Kroeber and Bernard L. Fontana have
pointed out, ``It is a large step from what may be biologically
innate leanings toward individual aggression to ritualized,
socially sanctioned, institutionalized group warfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as a 1989 conference on the anthropology of war concluded,
``The hypothesis of a killer instinct is ... not so much irrelevant
as wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the male appetite for battle has always been far less
voracious than either biologically inclined theorists of war or
army commanders might like. In traditional societies, warriors
often had to be taunted, intoxicated or ritually ``transformed''
into animal form before battle.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Western history, individual men have gone to
near-suicidal lengths to avoid participating in wars _ cutting off
fingers or limbs or risking execution by deserting. Prior to the
advent of the nationalist armies of the 19th century, desertion
rates in European armies were so high that, according to historian
Geoffrey Parker, ``at certain times, almost an entire army would
vanish into thin air.''
</P>
<P>
   So unreliable and prone to escape was the rank and file of the
famed 18th-century Prussian army that military manuals forbade
allowing the men to camp near wooded areas. Even in the supposedly
highly motivated armies of the 20th-century democracies, few men
can bring themselves to shoot directly at individual enemies _ a
fact, as Lt. Col. Dave Grossman writes in ``On Killing: The
Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society,'' that
has posed a persistent challenge to the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, we need not resort to instinctual male
aggressiveness to explain the male near-monopoly on warfare. One
reason is clearly biological, resting on men's advantage in upper
body strength _ an undeniable plus when the weapons of war are
heavy swords, spears, pikes, maces or clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Another explanation is cultural, or at least as purely cultural
as one can be: In many, if not most, human societies, male
initiation rites feature acts of violence committed by or on the
initiates, and one of the most common of these rites has been
participation in battle.
</P>
<P>
   Through ``blooding a spear'' a boy proved his manhood (or
through ordering the bombing of some smaller nation, in the case of
recent American presidents). For an activity to be a male
initiatory rite, it cannot, of course, be open to women and girls.
Hence the widespread taboos on female handling of weapons and, in
many cases, the tools of peaceable male-dominated crafts.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no reason to think that such initiatory activities
derive from instinctual male proclivities. In some cultural
settings, the young male's initiation to the adult world may be
entirely bloodless, featuring the receipt of a diploma or admission
into a guild.
</P>
<P>
   In others it may be violent in ways not related to war,
involving circumcision, homosexual rape or nose-bleeding induced
with sharp sticks _ activities that few would say are instinctually
driven.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the very purpose of male initiation rites is to
distinguish biological maleness, which undoubtedly includes a
healthy desire for self-preservation, from cultural manhood, which
requires a certain amount of self-discipline and even
self-sacrifice for the group (as does cultural womanhood).
</P>
<P>
   Nor can it be assumed that the male monopoly on warfare has been
eternal and universal.
</P>
<P>
   Gravesites recently excavated in Russia contain the remains of
women warriors from the second millennium B.C. _ female skeletons
buried with weapons and bearing wounds inflicted by similar
weapons. The victims of the famous Neolithic massacre at Jebel
Sahaba included both women and men, and there is no evidence that
the perpetrators were exclusively male.
</P>
<P>
   Moving back into the Paleolithic Age, when hunting was probably
the principal form of human violence, growing archaeological
evidence suggests that it was a communal enterprise in which women
and children joined men in driving herds over cliffs into nets or
culs-de-sac.
</P>
<P>
   The male-centered hunting strategy that figured so prominently
in the writings of sociobiologists in the 1960s and '70s _ in which
a small band of men stalks an individual animal _ may be a rather
recent innovation, necessitated by declining game populations in
the Mesolithic Age.
</P>
<P>
   In ancient civilizations, some of the earliest deities
worshipped by humans were female, but they were hardly the
nurturing earth mothers imagined by many scholars. The archaic
goddesses unearthed from Mesopotamian ruins or recalled in
Mesoamerican mythology were huntresses and avid consumers of blood
sacrifices, often accompanied or represented by predators such as
lions and leopards.
</P>
<P>
   Only later were these terrifying deities ``tamed'' through
marriage to patriarchical male gods and reassigned to agricultural
duties. Although the characteristics of the archaic goddesses tell
us nothing about the roles of actual women, they do suggest a time
when the association of manhood with violence and femininity with
gentlemen was not as self-evident as it has seemed in the modern
age.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever our genetic and prehistoric cultural legacies, women in
the past two centuries have more than adequately demonstrated a
capacity for collective violence. They have played a leading role
in nonmilitary violence such as 18th- and 19th-century bread riots
and revolutionary uprisings, in which they were often reputed to be
``foremost in violence and ferocity.''
</P>
<P>
   In World War II, the Soviet military deployed them as fighter
pilots and in ground combat. Since then, women have served as
terrorists and guerilla fighters in wars of national liberation.
More to the point, women have proved themselves no less susceptible
than men to the passions of militaristic nationalism: witness
feminist leader Sylvia Pankhurst, who set aside the struggle for
suffrage to mobilize English support for World War I by, for
example, publicly shaming men into enlisting.
</P>
<P>
   Among heads of government, Margaret Thatcher is an exception to
the gender dichotomy. Among the many exceptions on the male side of
the ledger are the anti-militaristic, social-democratic Olaf Palme
and Willy Brandt. And of course the greatest pacifist leaders of
the 20th century were male: Martin Luther King Jr. and Mohandas K.
Gandhi.
</P>
<P>
   Inherent aggressiveness of men and niceness of women? Perhaps
one thing is true: Whatever the innate psychological differences
between the sexes, a certain male propensity for chest-thumping
persists _ and it can be found among desk-dwelling American
scholars as well as alpha apes.

for ``literally a free-for-all'' on Friday because cooperation
among Democrats and Republicans has again broken down, this time on
the critical issue of how senators can be able to question the
parties, says Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz. Kyl told The Arizona Republic

`STILL CRAZY' A DEFT ROCK 'N' ROLL COMEDY THAT DOESN'T MISS A
BEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In films like ``Breaking Glass'' and ``What's Love Got to Do
With It,'' British director Brian Gibson has demonstrated a rare
gift for capturing both the cultural power of rock music and the
absurdity _ and inevitable corruption _ of being a rock star.
</P>
<P>
   In his new film, ``Still Crazy,'' he returns to this same
territory, but in a much gentler and more whimsical frame of mind,
and the result, while perhaps more glib and superficial than his
earlier two rock films, is so incorrigibly good-natured and
completely likable that it's impossible to resist.
</P>
<P>
   The film's distributor is flaunting ``Crazy'' as this year's
``The Full Monty,'' and the comparison is not bad: like that
earlier British comedy, this one finds both giddy humor and true
dignity in the spectacle of a group of middle-aged men trying to
find glory in a younger man's game. Also like that film, it
communicates a great affection for its characters.
</P>
<P>
   The story is about the members of Strange Fruit, a fictional,
late-'70s, British rock group that had its moment in the sun, but
fell apart in 1977 over the usual creative differences, and after
one act of divine intervention _ a lightning bolt actually struck
them while on stage at an outdoor concert.
</P>
<P>
   Cut to 20 years later, as Tony (Stephen Rea), the Fruit's
ex-keyboard player turned condom-machine supplier, gets the bright
idea of hunting down the far-flung members of the band and
reuniting them for a reunion tour on the Continent and maybe even a
``second shot at stardom.''
</P>
<P>
   It soon turns out that Brian, the creative spark of the group,
is dead, but Tony manages to gather up Les (Jimmy Nail), the
bassist turned small contractor; Beano (Timothy Spall), the drummer
turned day laborer; and Ray (Bill Nighy), the lead singer who saved
his money and now lives the life of a country squire.
</P>
<P>
   He also digs up their old roadie, Hughie (Billy Connolly); their
publicist Karen (Juliet Aubrey), now divorced with a teenage
daughter; and a new lead-guitarist: Luke (Hans Matheson), in his
20s and therefore young enough to be everyone else's son.
</P>
<P>
   The script follows this over-the-hill gang as it tries to find
its youthful fire, but instead finds the reappearance of the same
old conflicts that tore them apart 20 years ago, as well as a
much-diminished physical capacity and the snickering disrespect of
the rock music establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, Gibson doesn't overwork the backstage slapstick and
old-age gags, and instead skillfully turns the movie into both a
subtle comedy of character and an upbeat affirmation of the crucial
place rock music still holds in the survivors of Woodstock Nation.
</P>
<P>
   The film not only hints at ``Full Monty,'' it's also reminiscent
of both ``The Commitments'' and the more recent ``Velvet
Goldmine.'' And like those films, several of its musical sequences
are both poignant and thrilling. (One of its original songs, ``The
Flame Still Burns,'' has been nominated for a Golden Globe, and the
film itself has been nominated in the best musical or comedy slot.)
</P>
<P>
   As much as any comedy of the past year, ``Still Crazy'' is a
solid ensemble piece: all the actors register well in their parts,
with no weak links. But the clear standout here is veteran British
stage actor Bill Nighy, whose endearing, hilarious, genuinely
moving performance as the befuddled lead-singer Ray steals the
movie and deserves to ride it straight to a supporting actor Oscar
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Still Crazy. Directed by Brian Gibson. Written by Dick Clement
and Ian La Frenais. Cast: Stephan Rea, Billy Connolly, Timothy
Spall, Jimmy Nail, Bill Nighy, Juliet Aubrey. Columbia Pictures. 95
minutes. Rated R for language and some gross humor.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+

SOCIAL PROMOTION IS BAD; REPEATING A GRADE MAY BE WORSE
</HEADLINE>
   (fe) 
 By ETHAN BRONNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When President Clinton announced in his State of the Union
address this week that he wanted the federal government to press
schools to end ``social promotion,'' he was stepping into a
longstanding, mine-laden educational debate: When students fail, is
it better to have them repeat the grade or promote them to the next
grade to keep them with their age group?
</P>
<P>
   The president, in effect, is opting to hold them back. And while
it may seem obvious that promoting failing students does no one any
good _ giving parents and students false notions of their progress
and forcing teachers to dumb down curriculums _ most studies argue
against making pupils repeat grades.
</P>
<P>
   Students held back once usually end up doing somewhat worse in
school and have a smaller chance of graduating than equivalent
students allowed to move to the next grade. And youngsters held
back twice nearly always drop out.
</P>
<P>
   Few advocate social promotion _ moving pupils from one grade to
the next irrespective of their performance _ without remediation.
But most researchers say the alternative of making them repeat the
grade, known as retention, is worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The term `social promotion' carries so much emotion,''
commented C. Thomas Holmes, head of the department of educational
leadership at the University of Georgia, who analyzed 63 studies on
the issue. ``It sounds like we're letting kids get away with things
they didn't earn. But we are not stopping to ask what it is and
what we could do to avoid it rather than outlaw it.''
</P>
<P>
   School systems have seesawed between the two policies for
decades. Increasingly, educational researchers say that the choice
is a false one and that what is needed is a third way: early
identification of failing students and intensive intervention
through one-on-one tutoring, after-school programs and summer
school. But that costs a great deal of money.
</P>
<P>
   The president and his education advisers are aware of the need,
which is why they are also asking for a tripling of federal funds
for summer school and after-school programs to $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that even this would cover only a small portion
of what is needed nationally for such programs. The demand is
greatest not in suburban schools, where one or two students per
class might be held back each year, but in inner-city schools,
where 10 to 15 percent of a class face retention.
</P>
<P>
   Federal funds account for only about 7 percent of money spent on
education around the country. And since federal funds go to the
neediest schools, where failure is most common, some analysts are
concerned that schools with high failure rates will stop social
promotion, as demanded by the federal government, but will not
obtain the funds or structure to help students who are held back.
The result could be more harm than good.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think the argument against retention is that it hurts
self-esteem,'' said Lorrie A. Shepard, a professor of education at
the University of Colorado at Boulder, who was co-editor of the
book ``Flunking Grades: Research and Policies on Retention''
(Palmer Press, 1989). ``My position is, yes, it hurts self-esteem,
but I am not arguing against it on that basis. I am saying that
there is already an enormous amount of it going on, and research
shows that retention doesn't help achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   While most of the research supports Ms. Shepard's assertion, a
study in the Baltimore public schools contradicts it. Karl
Alexander, a sociologist at Johns Hopkins University, along with
two co-authors, published ``On the Success of Failure'' (Cambridge
University Press, 1994) in which he found that, on balance,
retention was slightly preferable to social promotion.
</P>
<P>
   The authors wrote, ``Having children repeat a year can and does
help academically; moreover, at least for children like those in
Baltimore, it does not compromise self-regard.'' But they added
that retention was no panacea, that ``a lasting solution requires
more than simply going over the same material twice.''

</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL GRAFS)
</P>
<P>
   Alexander added by telephone: ``These kids start out far behind.
For lots of them, retention stops the free fall.''
</P>
<P>
   His work also contradicts a 1980 study on the emotional effects
of retention in which children said going blind or losing a parent
were the only two life events that would be more stressful than
being held back.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL GRAFS)
</P>
<P>
   There are no good statistics on the number of students held back
or promoted annually but reliable estimates are that by the eighth
grade, between 20 and 50 percent of students have been held back
once. Numbers beyond the eighth grade have less meaning because
pupils are more often asked to repeat a course rather than an
entire year.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments against social promotion are many. The American
Federation of Teachers issued a study in 1997 in which the group
noted that if the United States is to move to more rigorous
academic standards, social promotion has no place.
</P>
<P>
   It said that social promotion harms youngsters, ``who are
deluded into thinking they have learned the knowledge and skills
necessary for success,'' as well as teachers, ``who must deal with
impossibly wide disparities in their students' preparation and
achievement'' and ``who face students who know that teachers wield
no credible authority to demand hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   It also harms the business community, which has to invest
millions of dollars in teaching new employees basic skills they
should have learned in school, and taxpayers, whose support of
public education is eroded, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   But the union study added that retention was equally rampant and
harmful. It too urged a comprehensive set of remedies, including
rigorous standards, early intervention and well-trained
specialists.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL GRAF)
</P>
<P>
   New York City has gone through both swings of this pendulum. In
the late 1970s, Frank J. Macchiarola, who was school chancellor,
sought to end social promotion through testing and retention
combined with summer school. He says the policy was starting to
work when he left office and his successor, Anthony J. Alvarado,
put a stop to it. Others remember it as problematic, with a number
of students forced to repeat grades two or three times.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL GRAF)
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons retention nationally is likely to increase if
Clinton's plan is put into place is the growing use everywhere of
tests to move from one grade to the next. When there is a cutoff,
many will not make it.
</P>
<P>
   The president held up Chicago as a new model of a system ending
social promotion and improving its students' test scores. But Ms.
Shepard of the University of Colorado said much of the success
comes from summers spent ``teaching to the test,'' meaning that
failing students are given drills aimed at helping them pass the
tests. They may not actually be making much real progress, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall S. Smith, the deputy education secretary, acknowledged
in a telephone interview that the president's plan, even if
financed at the requested level, would fill only a small portion of
the need for summer and after-school programs.
</P>
<P>
   (ARTICLE CAN END HERE)
</P>
<P>
   He said there were 15 to 20 applicants this year for every such
available federal program and the number of applicants is likely to
rise when word of increased funds gets out.
</P>
<P>
   But he said it was important to see the ending of social
promotion in the context of a number of steps being taken by the
government, including reducing class size, pushing for school
report cards so parents can choose better and improving teacher
quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people to be conscious of a whole approach, not just
to knee-jerk into retention,'' Smith said. ``Clearly, there are
going to be bad practices in a country with 95,000 schools. But the
federal government can influence states and local districts to have
a policy which includes this general strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Some educators are dubious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be willing to discuss abandoning social promotion if we
had year-round schooling or successful intervention,'' said Ronald
O. Ross, superintendent of the Mount Vernon city schools, a heavily
African-American system north of New York City. ``We already know
what we need to know about education, but we're not willing to put
up the money. I'd like all these people to take a deep breath and
think about a 6-year-old girl in first grade sitting next to a
10-year-old boy.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL GRAFS)
</P>
<P>
   Theodore R. Sizer, former dean of the Harvard University
Graduate School of Education, who runs a charter school in western
Massachusetts, said he is struck by what he considers the flawed
diagnosis that what American children need is more and more
testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People with cancer often run high temperatures, but that
doesn't mean what they need is aspirin,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL GRAFS)
</P>
<P>
   Educators also point to the fact that other countries do not
hold back their pupils the way Americans do yet still have widely
admired systems.
</P>
<P>
   According to the 1994 International Encyclopedia of Teaching and
Teacher Education, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Japan and South Korea
all have automatic promotion policies, under which no pupil is held
back.
</P>
<P>
   Marc S. Tucker of the National Center on Education and the
Economy, an advocate of national standards who has studied the
Danish system, said Danish pupils have the same teacher for the
first six to nine years of school. Moreover, while high school in
Denmark is quite rigorous, the first years of school are seen as
more social than academic.

   WASHINGTON _ The State Department told Congress Thursday that
the Commerce Department would have a voice but not a vote in
approving the export of American-made satellites.
</P>
<P>
   The department spelled out the new rules in a report required
when Congress passed a law last year shifting licensing authority
for the export of most commercial satellites from the Commerce
Department back to the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton originally opposed the measure but it was part
of the military budget that he signed last fall. The president's
strong opposition had prompted senior congressional Republicans to
warn the president last month not to undermine the intent of the
law by giving the Commerce Department a significant role in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's report _ which was due on Jan. 1 _ the State
Department said it would seek to review satellite licenses within
90 working days of an application. Industry officials, who favor
the more business-friendly Commerce Department, have complained
about the costs caused by delays in the process.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the State Department can take only national security and
foreign policy factors into account when weighing exports. The
Pentagon, which evaluates the national security issues, has an
effective veto over exports that the State Department controls.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Commerce Department makes trade a top
priority for the exports it regulates.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new plan, other agencies besides the Pentagon and the
State Department can comment on the licensing process but they will
not have a vote in the final decision.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton Mowry, executive director of the Satellite Industry
Association, said the State Department's 90-working-day goal was a
``positive step,'' but that the industry's ``number one concern is
resolving the potential delays in notifying Congress.'' The
schedule and rules of Congress can add several months to final
approval.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department report said it was reviewing the issue of
congressional notification.
</P>
<P>
   A senior State Department official said the recent findings of a
select congressional committee, led by Rep. Christopher Cox,
R-Calif., figured in Thursday's report. ``This is timely in that
the Cox committee favored the approach we're taking,'' the official
said.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's bipartisan report remains secret. But Cox has
said it found that two American satellite manufacturers _ Hughes
Electronics Corp. and Loral Space and Communications _ had harmed
national security when they helped Chinese scientists to determine
the causes of two rocket failures in 1995 and 1996. The companies
deny any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The new law takes effect in mid-March, three years after Clinton
initially decided to make the Commerce Department responsible for
satellite exports. In October 1995, after a review, the secretary
of state concluded that satellites should stay under his
jurisdiction. The Commerce Department appealed to the White House,
and the 1995 decision was reversed.
</P>
<P>
   But last year Congress switched licensing authority again, after
the reports about Hughes and Loral.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules call for an ``ad hoc consultative committee''
where representatives from other agencies, including Commerce, will
``meet as necessary in order to facilitate timely policy input into
any complex cases that exceed the 90-working-day time frame.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department also plans to expand its licensing office
by adding missile and space experts and investigators.

CLINTON URGES CONGRESS TO `INVEST IN WHAT WORKS' IN SCHOOLS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton promoted his education proposals
Thursday, announcing steps the federal government should take to
help schools find new teachers necessary for a burgeoning student
population.
</P>
<P>
   The president, joined by first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton,
Education Secretary Richard Riley and former military officers now
serving as teachers, urged Congress to become more involved in the
country's school districts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton sought to talk about schools during a White House
ceremony while blocks away his attorneys were wrapping up their
three-day presentation to the Senate deliberating his removal from
office. Clinton made no mention of the ongoing impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we have a real opportunity to get more good teachers in
general, more good education practice, and more properly,
specifically trained teachers in particular this year,'' the
president said, noting it was time for the five-year review of how
the government invests $15 billion in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us a golden opportunity and a solid responsibility to
change the way we invest the money, to invest in what works and to
stop investing in what doesn't,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president outlined a plan to bolster the number of
schoolteachers in the United States by calling on Congress to
provide $1.4 billion as a second installment in the hiring of
100,000 teachers over five years.
</P>
<P>
   He proposed that Congress provide $35 million for 7,000 college
scholarships to encourage the brightest students to become teachers
in inner city and rural areas, where recruitment is the most
difficult. He asked Congress to spend $10 million to help train
1,000 Native Americans to become teachers on Indian reservations
and public schools with large Native American populations.
</P>
<P>
   And, he proposed $18 million to recruit and train retired
military personnel to become teachers. The 5-year-old Troops for
Teachers program helped 3,000 retired military personnel become
schoolteachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secretary of Education always tells me that we're going to
have to hire 2 million more teachers in the next few years because
of the growth of the student population and the retirement of the
existing teacher corps. So I think we should do more and this is a
big down payment on it,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   During his State of the Union address Tuesday, Clinton unveiled
an Education Accountability Act. It would require schools that
accept federal funds to stop social promotions and provide summer
school to those who fail; adopt strict discipline codes; give
parents report cards on their children's schools; provide funds to
help states turn around the worst performing schools and require
new teachers to take performance exams.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. William Goodling, R-Pa., chairman of the House Education
Committee, dismissed the president's proposal. ``Americans want
those common-sense education ideas _ not more regulations, nor
federal tests, nor unfunded mandates, nor duplicative programs,''
Goodling said.
</P>
<P>
   Goodling two years ago blocked Clinton's plan to establish
voluntary national testing of students in math and reading.
</P>
<P>
   The president defended his latest plan, saying it was not _ as
some have implied _ a bid by the federal government to assume
control of local school districts.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Clinton said, the proposal would ``simply have the
federal government respond to what the teachers of this country and
the principals and the educators have been telling us, and invest
in what works. We now have an opportunity to do that. With the
strength of our economy and with the size of our surplus, we have
an opportunity; we also have an obligation.''

POPE A BIG SELLER IN MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Forget Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to mass-marketing and corporate sponsorships these
days, His Airness is getting stiff competition down here from His
Holiness.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II, who Friday begins a six-day visit to Mexico
and the United States, has been an frequent critic of
commercialism. But as he winds his way through the wide avenues of
Mexico's capital, he may find that his words have gone mostly
unheeded by the organizers of his stay.
</P>
<P>
   The pope may, for example, see a smiling image of himself on
bags of Sabritas, a popular brand of potato chips. He'll find it
hard to miss the giant blue street signs that show him bowing
piously next to a Pepsi logo with the phrase in Spanish that reads,
``Mexico Always Faithful.''
</P>
<P>
   And if he happens to surf the Internet while he's here, he'll
probably use one of the hundreds of terminals provided by Hewlett
Packard, which is the official computer of the papal visit.
</P>
<P>
   To help finance the pontiff's fourth voyage to Mexico, Catholic
officials here have managed to attract financial and in-kind
donations from about two dozen corporations. But the aggressive _
some say tacky _ marketing campaigns that have resulted have
created a maelstorm of controversy within the church and among
ordinary citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a reflection of the lack of professionalism and
discretion by the people who authorize the use of the pope's
image,'' said Rev. Manuel Olimon, a professor at the Pontificate
University in Mexico City. ``This is just another example of how a
small group of church leaders can be so distant from the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bringing the pope to Mexico _ or anyplace else _ isn't cheap or
easy. The tab for Pope John Paul II's stay in Mexico is expected to
cost about $1.5 million, archdiocese officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the resources being spent on extra security and
touching up rundown buildings and streets, organizers must also
find ways and funds to handle the demanding throngs of local,
national and international media. Special furniture for papal
meetings must be built, and the Popemobile, his special
bulletproof, bubble-shaped limousine, must be tuned-up.
</P>
<P>
   Although past visits have been underwritten by corporations,
such as banks and bread companies, Olimon and other critics said,
this year's promotional campaigns are unusually brazen. And that's
even before taking into consideration the fringe vendors hawking
papal gear without the Vatican's endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that the company's name would be politely placed
at the end of a commercial or advertisement,'' Olimon, a historian,
added. ``But now it's harder to know which message is more
important, the pope or the logo.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other companies, Sabritas, a division of Texas-based
Frito-Lay, which is a subsidiary of PepsiCo, said it was approached
by archdiocese leaders last fall who proposed a promotional
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were honored to be ask to participate,'' said Tod
MacKenzie, a company spokesman. ``Given that the request was coming
from the church, we didn't have any problems'' with whether this
was an appropriate thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has produced bags of its ``papitas'' _ which means
both ``potatoes'' and ``pope'' in Spanish _ featuring a yellow
ribbon bearing the Vatican's coat of arms. One of 10 different
papal images has been stuffed inside each specially marked 25-cent
bag. In all, MacKenzie said, 90 million photographs are being
distributed through the 400,000 distribution points around Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The profits from the campaign, about $200,000, will go toward
restoring a house to host special guests to Mexico City's Our Lady
of Guadalupe Basilica, which the pope will visit on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Church officials have also looked for money directly from
individuals. Each reporter covering the event, for example, has
been charged $300 for credentials, five times more than the pope's
visit last year to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt the pope generates huge sales wherever he travels. In
St. Louis, where he will land on Tuesday for a two-day stay, stores
selling commemorative gifts are having a hard time keeping shelves
stocked. Workers there compare the mania to the rush surrounding
the record-breaking home-run performance by St. Louis Cardinals
first baseman Mark McGwire in September.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the items in high demand include a gold-plated papal
letter opener for $15, a $16 marble paperweight featuring the
Mississippi River and the coat of arms of the Archdiocese of St.
Louis and an $8 pewter keychain depicting the papal symbol on one
side and the St. Louis arch on the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the organizers have tried to make sure that items sold
for the visit are in good taste,'' said Amy Benson, papal
commemoratives coordinator for Catholic Supply of St. Louis, a
chain of three-stores in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``But people are definitely getting excited about this visit and
it's starting to show up in sales. This last week stuff has been
flying out the door. Usually this is a real dead time, but right
now it's like Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   The Archdiocese of St. Louis has tried to prevent truly
tasteless items _ like the infamous pope-on-a-rope soap that has
been a feature of past US papal visits _ from reaching stores. It
created a separate, nonprofit committee to grant official church
licenses to vendors wanting to sell papal goods.
</P>
<P>
   Church officials in Mexico have had less success in stopping
questionable ads, including one that features a video clip of
Cardinal Norberto Rivera endorsing a product.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in an era of publicity and we are men of this era,''
he recently told a Mexico City daily.
</P>
<P>
   Other corporate sponsors include Mexicana Airlines, which will
fly the pontiff to St. Louis, FedEx, and both of the country's
major television networks, which have pledged to beam wall-to-wall
coverage of the visit to the country's 88 million Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   While papal souvenirs have proliferated for decades, the recent
explosion in quantity and availability perhaps attest to the
excesses of global capitalism _ one of John Paul's biggest
complaints about modern society.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the saturation of ads will have a negative or positive
impact on the morale of the faithful remains to be seen. For now,
though, the reviews are mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's too much and even a little disrespectful,'' said
Eugenia Perez Loya, a 61-year-old shoe store clerk.
</P>
<P>
   But Candelario Cruz, a 23-year-old waiter, echoed the cardinal's
modern-day philosphy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is commercialized,'' Cruz said, wearing a Nike
T-shirt and an Adidas baseball cap. ``Sometimes it's good and
sometimes it's bad, but you can't get away from it.''

NOTRE DAME TO REPLAY TO BIG TEN IN TWO WEEKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Two weeks from today, an announcement is
expected that could start another round of conference shuffling in
college sports.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 5, Notre Dame's board of trustees is expected to
announce the school's decision on an invitation to join the 11-team
Big Ten Conference. The board meeting will be in London, where
Notre Dame is dedicating a new building on its London campus.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement will culminate nearly six months of meetings
and negotiations between the conference and the school. Notre Dame
is a member of the Big East Conference in all sports but football.
The Irish football program has not been part of a conference in its
111-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Big 12 Conference commissioner Kevin Weiberg, who was heavily
involved in the Notre Dame discussions as a Big Ten associate
commissioner, said yesterday that Notre Dame's decision is a
mystery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know both sides have been exchanging information,'' Weiberg
said. ``I don't know if this meeting will mark the end of that, if
there will be a yes-or-no decision made.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either way, it will be a major announcement. If Notre Dame
joins the Big Ten, would that have a major impact on the Big 12?
I'm not sure that it would. I'm not sure if it would create a
domino effect with other conferences around the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame's academic leaders want the school to join the Big
Ten because of the academic reputation of its member schools. Notre
Dame's athletic leaders, students and alumni are in favor of
remaining an independent.
</P>
<P>
   Big East Conference commissioner Mike Tranghese and the rest of
his conference's schools believe that Notre Dame will reject the
Big Ten invitation and remain an independent in football.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big Ten and the Big East both want to know where we are,
they want an answer either way,'' said John Heisler, Notre Dame
assistant athletic director for sports information.

AXTELL LEARNS TOUGH LESSONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAWRENCE, Kan. _ Luke Axtell has learned the life lesson of
never looking back.
</P>
<P>
   With his former team in town to meet his current team, Axtell
met with the media Monday night 90 minutes before Kansas defeated
Texas, 76-67. Axtell was a main character in last March's Longhorns
soap opera that led to the departure of Texas coach Tom Penders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things just got really messed up, and I learned from it,''
said Axtell, who is sitting out this season after transferring to
Kansas. ``You go through the stuff in life that's going to make you
mature.''
</P>
<P>
   Axtell was one of four Texas players who met with athletic
director DeLoss Dodds last March to complain about Penders'
coaching style. Penders suspended Axtell because Penders claimed
Axtell was lagging academically. Axtell's grades were released to
Austin radio station KVET, which is a violation of federal student
privacy laws.
</P>
<P>
   Axtell's family is suing the radio station. Axtell would not
comment on the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Under NCAA transfer rules, he can't play for a year. Typically,
transfers preserve a year of eligibility by redshirting. But
Axtell's sophomore season is a competitive waste. A ruling by the
Big 12 Conference involving intra-league transfers caused him to
lose a year of eligibility. He'll be a junior when he plays for the
Jayhawks next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is that I'm here now and it's a great system. ...
And the coaching staff, especially coach \RRoy\S Williams,
understands the players and their abilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Has the 6-foot-9, 210-pound Axtell learned more about basketball
at Kansas than he did at Texas last season?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he said. ``Um ... yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   All you need to know about his feelings regarding his former
coach, can be found in the Kansas media guide. Asked which school
he most looks forward to playing, Axtell answered: George
Washington, which is now coached by Penders.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had anything to say about Penders, Axtell let
brevity be his guide.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he answered.

MUONEKE BATTLES A DEMON INSIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Gabe Mouneke won't play basketball tomorrow
night. And we can only guess with what demons he will wrestle in
his mind as he sits and watches his Texas teammates face Oklahoma
State in a pivotal Big 12 South battle.
</P>
<P>
   What we do know is that Muoneke is a troubled young man. As
coach Rick Barnes talked earlier this week about his suspension of
his leading scorer for throwing body punches to two Kansas players
Monday night, he stressed his belief that Muoneke is not a thug.
Those of us who have been around him even on a peripheral basis
know that to be true.
</P>
<P>
   Muoneke is a good student. A young man who dreams of one day
doing good works in his homeland of Nigeria. A young man who says
the person he would most like to meet is Jesus Christ, ``because
human nature boggles me.''
</P>
<P>
   Most certainly, his own nature boggles him. He eloquently
addressed the dichotomy of his personality during an interview for
a profile run in these pages last month, two days after he punched
a Wisconsin player. Muoneke was open and expressive again on
Tuesday in Austin as he publicly faced the unpleasant music of his
actions rather than hide behind a statement.
</P>
<P>
   He expressed the hurt he feels, anguished over the embarrassment
he has caused his family, the bind into which he has put his
teammates. He spoke of remorse at betraying Barnes' trust. He also
said he sometimes feels he has no control over what he does, how he
reacts to situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even during the game when \Rhe threw the first punch\S, I
didn't understand it,'' Muoneke said. ``I was running back down the
court and thought, `Oh, God. I did something again.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of strange because I've never asked myself why I do
something like that. Usually, I knew why, but it's difficult
because I don't snap like that, and that's what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Muoneke said that when Barnes showed him on tape what he'd done,
he found it shocking and embarrassing. ``And that's what scares me
more than anything else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That may sound like a tap-dance, a cop-out to those of you who
don't have a temper problem. Being one who has wrestled that devil
for a lifetime, I think I know what Gabe is going through. There
have been times when I have gone ballistic for the most minute
reasons and later wondered what on earth could have so provoked me.
Other times, I've been aware what was happening, yet felt powerless
to do anything about it, as if in third person wondering how far I
would go. Indeed, it is scary.
</P>
<P>
   Those of you who may have faced alcoholism or other related
problems know it is a daily, hourly struggle to maintain control.
But an alcoholic can stay out of bars. If Muoneke plans to continue
to play college basketball, he cannot avoid the situations that
provoke these outbursts. He will be baited, taunted, goaded.
</P>
<P>
   Muoneke has asked for help and understanding, conceding that may
be hard for some to give. He has asked for prayers. He will get
mine.
NCAA ARROGANT? So, Roy Williams, how do you feel about the way the
NCAA has handled this case brought by former restricted-earnings
coaches?
</P>
<P>
   ``The two coaches I had here would have been perfectly happy if
they'd changed the rule, given them $11.95 and said have a nice
meal,'' the Kansas coach said. ``I think the majority of the
restricted-earnings coaches felt the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not in favor of any restricted earnings coaches becoming
millionaires, but at the same time the arrogant attitude of the
NCAA and its lawyers are what caused this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   A federal jury has ordered the NCAA to pay a suit settlement of
$74.5 million. But counting lawyers' fees the NCAA must pay for
both sides in the five-year battle, the tab is approximately $90
million.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge last week ruled against an NCAA motion for a new
trial and there are indications the NCAA will appeal. Which means
while the NCAA fiddles, interest on the tab accrues at about
$300,000 monthly.
</P>
<P>
   Recall the rule was hatched by NCAA Division I presidents to
save money by limiting low-level assistants to $16,000 salaries
(1991-95). LADY RAIDERS RUMBLE Who would have thought that one of
Texas Tech coach Marsha Sharp's concerns might be overconfidence as
the No. 6 Lady Raiders (17-1, 6-0) steam into Kansas for tomorrow
afternoon's game with the preseason league favorite? The Jayhawks
(13-6, 3-3) have lost three of their past four. Tech _ keyed by its
new defensive scheme _ ripped No. 14 Iowa State, 71-47, Wednesday
night in the meeting between the Big 12's last two unbeaten teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kansas has been a puzzle,'' Sharp conceded. ``But you have to
know what's going on in their minds right now _ looking to get this
thing turned around and heading in the right direction. It's a
dangerous time to be playing a team as talented as they are at
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We obviously are coming off an emotional win, and it's going
to be a challenge to focus and handle Kansas' athleticism.''
</P>
<P>
   With the return to the rotation of guard Julie Lake and forward
Aleah Johnson, none of Sharp's five starters lately has been
playing much more than 30 minutes a game.
</P>

   ``I think we found out why Texas Tech is the No. 6 team in the
country,'' Iowa State coach Bill Fennelly said. WASH AND WEAR
Baylor coach Sonja Hogg misses few tricks, and has a few of her
own.
</P>
<P>
   After noting that she'd never had a team play with such a lack
of emotion during Saturday's 86-65 loss at Oklahoma, she locked the
dressing room doors and had her players wash their own workout gear
the next three days.
</P>
<P>
   Then when the Lady Bears reported for a shootaround before
Wednesday's game with Kansas State, she passed out T-shirts bearing
the Oklahoma score and had the players wear them during the short
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor then blitzed K-State, 82-53.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't trying to be a bad old lady,'' Hogg said afterward.
``We just needed to get our priorities straight. We don't need to
take things for granted. When you get locked out of your locker
room, you don't like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased with this basketball team. I always love
them, but I don't always like them. After the Oklahoma game, I
loved them but I didn't like them. Tonight, I love and like them.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor (9-7, 2-4) has one more shot at boosting its fading power
rating on Sunday when it plays at No. 19 Virginia in the Big 12-ACC
Challenge. Iowa State is at Clemson in the other game. OH YOU
(TEXAS) KIDS Oklahoma coach Sherri Coale's team _ which plays at
Texas tomorrow _ has rebounded from three Big 12 losses to defeat
in-state rival Oklahoma State and Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   Coale says that for recruiting purposes, defeating Baylor and
last year's win over Texas mean more than beating Oklahoma State
for the first time in her three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids in Oklahoma grow up either a Cowgirl or a Sooner,'' she
said. ``We battle more for Texas kids than we do for in-state kids.
Texas has a lot of open ears for us right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma's top player, Phylesha Whaley, is from Slaton. And
Granbury star Emily Britt, who leads Class 4A-5A area players in
scoring and ranks in the top 10 in three other categories, was one
of four impressive signees in November. FREE THROWS Oklahoma State
coach Eddie Sutton said NCAA-proposed criminal background checks on
men's and women's NCAA Tournament officials don't register with him
one way or the other. However.

   ``I do think sometimes officials ought to have to face writers
after a game,'' Sutton said.
</P>
<P>
   This message from Kansas post player T.J. Pugh after the
Jayhawks' defeat of Texas on Monday night: ``What we're saying is
we may have lost some good basketball players, but if you want to
win the conference championship it still comes through here.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't you love the paranoia that sweeps the Old Big Eight when
someone like Rick Barnes deigns to suggest moving the Big 12
basketball tournament out of Kansas City?

NBA STARS' MOANING HURTS RECOVERY PROCESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Say this for the NBA:
</P>
<P>
   It took awhile, but when it finally came time to screw up, these
people did so royally.
</P>
<P>
   There had been years of smug bragging about being the only major
pro sports league never to have lost a regular-season game due to a
labor work-stoppage.
</P>
<P>
   But as the NBA finally opened training camps yesterday, I've now
got the league ranked a solid second on the all-time list of stupid
management-union disasters in sports.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing compares to baseball's shutting down the playoffs and
World Series five years ago. That one is the Armageddon of labor
spats.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL formerly held second place on the brain-dead list due to
its use of regular-season replacement players in 1982. But along
came the NBA, and...
</P>
<P>
   In a titanic combo of the retirement of Michael Jordan and also
losing half of this season, there's a new runner-up in the cuckoo's
nest.
</P>
<P>
   Don Nelson was among many back at work yesterday, sending the
Mavericks through two practice sessions. Nelson has drawn a
paycheck in the NBA for 36 consecutive years as player, coach and
general manager. On longevity alone, he's a league spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprising, Nelson was attempting yesterday to pump some
sunshine into the big picture, saying, ``We have the best
basketball in the world, basketball is a great sport, so despite
this situation, it will be hard for us to fail in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nelson didn't sound all that sure, when he added, ``We've
stubbed our toe, no doubt about it. So we'll have to see what
happens. I think we'll struggle for a while, but then come back.
It's too good a product.''
</P>
<P>
   With Jordan, then Nelson might be right. Without Jordan, then
the NBA's regaining even close to its popularity of the '80s and
'90s is impossible. The question is not does the league fall in
prestige and TV ratings, but by how much?
</P>
<P>
   ``Going through a Jordan withdrawal period was going to happen
pretty soon anyway,'' said Nelson. ``He might have been good for
two more seasons, tops. But when it happened, it was going to hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, losing Michael and going through a work
stoppage creates some very bad timing for us. There is no question
we've got that to overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, the Mavericks already know the feeling of losing
out in a popularity contest. Once a mighty franchise from the
standpoint of fan support, a bad decade of losing teams has emptied
the seats at Reunion.
</P>
<P>
   And while Nelson is under the whip in his franchise restoration
project, at least players and management in Dallas conducted
themselves admirably during the long lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Sword rattling by those Mavericks who agreed with the union
position was not evident. Michael Finley, the team's best player,
lost $2.3 million during the lockout, but quietly _ and I stress
quietly _ supported his union. There was never a whine from Finley.
</P>
<P>
   Newcomer Steve Nash, the point guard, also alienated no one with
his well-spoken yet mild backing of the union.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, reserve guard Hubert Davis became an elegant
spokesman in disagreeing with the union. Another in disagreement
was forward Chris Anstey. Both Davis and Anstey received threats of
physical harm from players on other teams, but refused to back
down. Hey, it's America, even if Anstey is from down under.
</P>
<P>
   As opposed to the Mavericks, there were such yo-yos as union
president Patrick Ewing of the Knicks. A loose mouth throughout the
process, will Ewing ever live down saying, ``It's unfair to ask
players of today to try and survive on $700,000-$800,000 a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Guard Kenny Anderson makes more than triple that, but he fretted
over having to sell one of his eight cars, just to make ends meet,
you see.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Hardaway, however, allowed us all to feel better when he
observed, ``Guys aren't able to make $15 \Rmillion\S or $20 million
anymore, so you just have to play for the love of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   It's heartwarming to realize some of the rich guys are willing
to gut-it-up like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think fans were mad at basketball, but it was the
lockout instead,'' said Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Nellie, it's buffoons like Ewing, Anderson, Hardaway,
etc., who gave your business a bad name. What they did was make an
already difficult recovery even more iffy.

PROBE HURTS HOLBROOKE'S CHANCES FOR AMBASSADORSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Justice Department investigation into possible
ethics violations by Richard C. Holbrooke, the US Balkans envoy,
have set back his chances to become US ambassador to the United
Nations, according to US officials.
</P>
<P>
   But sources close to Holbrooke said Thursday that his lawyers
are seeking to negotiate a settlement that would rescue his bid for
the Cabinet-level diplomatic post.
</P>
<P>
   US officials said Thursday that Holbrooke's nomination could be
derailed by his refusal to accept a Justice Department offer to pay
a fine to settle charges that he improperly lobbied a US embassy
official in South Korea on behalf of his employer.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department accused Holbrooke, then a consultant for
Credit Suisse First Boston, of asking the sitting US ambassador to
South Korea, Jim Laney, to arrange a series of meetings with South
Korean government officials.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has threatened to file a civil lawsuit
against Holbrooke. US officials say that President Clinton will not
put his name forward as US ambassador to the United Nations if he
is the subject of an ongoing federal lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will not be cleared if he is the subject of a federal
lawsuit,'' said an administration official familiar with the
charges, which were first reported in The New York Times Thursday.
``It just won't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   A source close to Holbrooke, who was unavailable for an
interview, said the diplomat declined to pay the fine because he
believed he had done nothing wrong. The source added that Holbrooke
has been cleared of a separate investigation into an anonymous
charge that he lobbied US officials on behalf of the company in
Hungary in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ambasssador Holbrooke is interested in settling this as soon
as possible,'' the source said. ``I think this thing is pretty
trivial. For seven months they have been looking into these
allegations and this is all that they have come up with.''
</P>
<P>
   Winston Lord, the former US assistant secretary of state for
East Asian Affairs, said that he had asked Holbrooke, his
predecessor and a former US ambassador to Germany, to brief the
Asians on European policy if he visited the region. He added that
it would have been out of line for a former high-ranking official
not to inform the US ambassador that he was planning to meet with
Korean officials on his turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't need Laney's help to set up a meeting with the
Korean government,'' Lord said. He added that an official of
Holbrooke's stature would have undermined Laney's standing if
conducted a meeting with senior Korean officials without first
consulting with Laney. ``I would have called him up and yelled at
him.''
</P>
<P>
   White House national security spokesman P.J. Crowley said
Thursday that the president has no immediate plans to send his name
before the Senate for confirmation. While US officials say they
will not actively promote the Holbrooke's nomination until the
dispute is resolved, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart takes a
more supportive stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president believes that Richard Holbrooke is a gifted
diplomat,'' Lockhart said. ``He has made incredible contributions
to our foreign policy team during this administration. We look
forward to sending forward the nomination once this review is
complete.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, who headed the investigation into
possible ethics lapses by Holbrooke, declined to discuss the
investigation, saying that it is still ``pending.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear whether the episode will impede diplomatic
efforts to resolve the crisis in the Balkans. White House and State
Department officials said that Holbrooke, who recently hinted that
he may travel to Belgrade, has no immediate plans to undertake a
mission to the region.

U.S. DIPLOMAT HAS UNPRODUCTIVE MEETING WITH MILOSEVIC  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN ERLANGER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ A senior U.S. diplomat had an almost
entirely unproductive four-hour meeting Thursday night with the
Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, telling him that he must
meet Western demands to ease the crisis in the Serbian province of
Kosovo or face military action by NATO, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Hill, the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, and his
colleague, James Pardew, found Milosevic ``inflexible on all key
compliance issues,'' Pardew said. ``It was not a productive
meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill characterized the discussion as ``rather difficult,'' but
said that despite disagreements with Milosevic, ``we very much
expect full compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill arrived here Thursday from Washington after a meeting with
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Washington and the West are
insisting that Milosevic stop human rights abuses in Kosovo, allow
international investigation of the violence there, punish those
responsible and reduce his security forces in the province to
levels agreed upon in October, the last time NATO threatened to
bomb the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   A senior diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity said that
although Hill had set out what Milosevic was expected to do, ``we
do not have with Milosevic a common understanding of what needs to
be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, for instance, completely rejects the idea that
Serbian forces of any kind were responsible for the killing of 45
ethnic Albanians last Friday in the village of Racak, the event
that brought on the latest crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic called the affair a propaganda effort by ethnic
Albanian rebels seeking to blame the Serbs for stalled talks on the
status of the province, the senior diplomat said. The U.S.
government, however, has no doubt that Serbian forces carried out
the killings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As the meeting began Thursday evening, there were signs that the
clearest and simplest of the Western demands would be finessed, if
not explicitly met: the head of the international observer mission
in Kosovo, William Walker, the U.S. delegate to the Organization of
Security and Cooperation in Europe, will be allowed to stay on the
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no give on Walker'' from Milosevic, the senior
diplomat said. ``But there was also no reaffirmation of the need to
expel him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs ordered him out of the country after he saw the
victims of the mass killing and said it was the work of Serbian
forces and a crime against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, too, insisted that Walker remain and said the
international monitors he oversees would be withdrawn from Kosovo
otherwise, a necessary first step to any NATO bombing and one
likely to allow the conflict in Kosovo to escalate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic has invited world condemnation by trying to expel
the director of the Kosovo Verification Mission, Ambassador Bill
Walker, for doing his job with frankness and courage,'' Albright
said. ``And he's blocking efforts by the International War Crimes
Tribunal to investigate the latest atrocity.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Albright, like other U.S. allies and the NATO secretary general,
Javier Solana, urged new thinking to reach a political settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ethnic Albanians are fragmented; the Kosovo Liberation
Army has committed deliberately provocative acts of kidnapping and
murder,'' she said. ``The outlook for a negotiated solution is
cloudy. But what is clear is that the status quo is neither
acceptable nor sustainable.''
</P>
<P>
   The next step is a meeting of the so-called contact group of
nations that will be dedicated to the Kosovo crisis. Russia,
traditionally an ally of the Serbs, will be represented at the
meeting, which is scheduled in London on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It is obvious that many NATO countries, including Germany,
France and Greece, have serious doubts about the value of bombing
Serbia and about what might follow such a step.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, President Clinton and the British prime minister,
Tony Blair, agreed in a telephone conversation that more had to be
done to find a political solution, while insisting that Milosevic
adhere to the October deal, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But senior Western diplomats said a political deal was proving
extremely difficult, notwithstanding the latest provocations,
because of continuing splits among the ethnic Albanians. Hill has
had to deliver the same talk four different times in four different
rooms to squabbling Albanian factions, a senior diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Serbian side is unwilling to grant real
autonomy to Kosovo within Yugoslavia, fearing that it will lead to
independence.
</P>
<P>
   That has led some diplomats and Serbs to believe, said a
prominent Serbian journalist, Ljiljana Smajlovic, that Milosevic
may even want this crisis to produce a NATO intervention on the
ground in Kosovo, which would make the Kosovo rebels NATO's problem
and would effectively prevent Kosovo from achieving independence.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, Milosevic clearly sees value, Ms. Smajlovic said,
in pursuing a confrontational path that is producing a patriotic
unity behind an anti-Western and increasingly anti-American stance.
This crisis, like others before it, she said, diverts the attention
of the Serbian people from the poverty of the state and of their
lives.

GOP IS DIVIDED ON HOW TO SAVE SOCIAL SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans were quick to criticize President
Clinton's proposal to invest a portion of Social Security's
reserves in the stock market, but they have been slow to lay out
any specific alternative for dealing with the retirement system's
problems, because other options have their own economic and
political drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan is built around earmarking $2.7 trillion in
projected federal budget surpluses over the next 15 years for
Social Security, and investing around $700 billion of that in
stocks in an effort to capture some of the hefty returns available
on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans do not object to using a big part of the surplus for
Social Security, and party leaders like Rep. Bill Archer of Texas,
the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, endorsed the
president's approach on Thursday on that score. They also support
efforts to reap higher investment returns.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans are divided over whether the best way to use the
surplus on behalf of Social Security is to pay down the national
debt, as Clinton wants, and they have rejected the idea of the
government becoming a stock buyer, saying it would amount to
meddling in the free-enterprise system.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Republicans want Social Security to be remade to allow
individuals to invest part of their payroll taxes in stocks and
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   There are two basic approaches to doing this, each with its own
proponents and critics, and its own political risks.
</P>
<P>
   Under one approach, two percentage points of the 12.4 percent
payroll tax that finances Social Security would be diverted into
private investment accounts owned by each worker. But making such a
plan work would require substantial reductions in Social Security's
guaranteed benefit through mechanisms such as increasing the
retirement age and tweaking the formulas that determine average
lifetime earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Although its proponents say the return on investment from the
private accounts would more than make up for the cutbacks in the
guaranteed benefit, the political costs of backing the necessary
cutbacks is sufficient that some Republicans are backing away.
</P>
<P>
   The second approach, which is increasingly popular among
Republicans, would provide offsetting tax breaks to workers who
placed a portion of their payroll tax into private accounts. But it
would pay for the change largely by using the surplus, and would
reduce guaranteed benefits only to the degree that gains from the
investment account still allowed each worker to come out ahead.
</P>
<P>
   This approach, developed by Martin Feldstein of Harvard
University, would be pain-free _ but only for a decade or two, when
the government would again face huge deficits. In effect, critics
say, it would just push down the road for a few years the hard
decisions about how to ensure Social Security's long-term solvency
and make it hard if not impossible to reduce the national debt in
the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are not alone in their dilemma. Although he put
forth a framework for dealing with Social Security, Clinton
admitted that his ideas would not solve the entire problem, and
that the administration and Congress would still have to make some
tough choices about tax increases and benefit cuts to get the job
done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton's speech only gave the easy solutions, and the
Republicans only responded with their easy solutions,'' said Ron
Gebhardtsbauer, senior pension fellow at the American Academy of
Actuaries, a nonpartisan research organization. ``We're looking for
the free lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's effort to minimize the pain rests on his proposal to
devote $2 trillion over the next 15 years to reducing the national
debt. (The other $700 billion that he would earmark for Social
Security would be invested in the stock market.)
</P>
<P>
   Under the administration's plan, the $2 trillion would be used
by the Social Security system to buy government bonds held by the
public.
</P>
<P>
   Those bonds would then essentially become part of the Social
Security trust fund, and the interest payments on them would
bolster the retirement system's reserves, extending its solvency to
around 2050 from 2032.
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, the approach is an accounting gimmick. Because
the debt would be transferred from the public onto the government's
own books, it would not reduce the total debt outstanding,
currently about $5.5 trillion including money that the government
owes to itself under its complex accounting system.
</P>
<P>
   But it would reduce the publicly held debt, currently about $3.8
trillion. And it is that public-debt portion of the nation's
balance sheet that is the more important economically, because its
size determines how much competition there is between the
government and the private sector for capital.
</P>
<P>
   The lower the publicly held debt, the less the government's
borrowing needs push up interest rates and crowd out investment by
companies in new products, factories and jobs. In that sense,
reducing the publicly held debt could give a boost to the economy,
which would in turn help Social Security by increasing the number
of people working, the size of their paychecks and the taxes they
pay to support the retirement system.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's plan would not solve all of Social Security's
problems, and White House officials acknowledge that the
administration and Congress still have to find a way to deal with
the remaining shortfall over the next 75 years. They could devote
more of the surplus to the problem _ a strategy that the
administration considered _ or they could turn to the menu of
unappetizing benefit cuts and tax increases that both parties have
been poring over for the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, however, remain reluctant to get any more specific
about how they would proceed until Clinton provides more details of
what steps he is willing to support.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., said on Tuesday that the retirement
system could be shored up through private accounts ``without
touching a dime in Social Security funds, without raising one
nickel in taxes, without touching one penny in current benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dunn did not, however, explain how, prompting Gebhardtsbauer
of the American Academy of Actuaries to say she ``ignores the fact
that if there is no pain anywhere, it ends up being our kids who
pay.''

DIVINE ENDORSEMENTS SPARK UNHOLY ROW IN MEXICO

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Someone looking at the billboards across Mexico
City could be forgiven for thinking the pope had taken the Pepsi
challenge, decided to dump the real thing and signed up as a fully
fledged member of Generation Next.
</P>
<P>
   For the month of January, at least, Pepsi is the drink of choice
for the Vatican generation. ``Pepsi, always faithful,'' read the
signs plastered across the Mexican capital.
</P>
<P>
   No matter that Pope John Paul II is 78 and hardly known for
swilling soft drinks in public. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The Vatican apparently has decided that the medium is the
message and that plastic mugs, stamp albums and billboards bearing
the pope's likenesses can get the message across.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in an age of publicity,'' said Papal Nuncio Justo
Mullor, ``and communication is a language. We have to raise
funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Mexico, on the eve of John Paul's fourth trip to the
Aztec nation, the Vatican is doing just that through a host of
deals with companies eager for a divine endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   The Holy See has passed the plate to companies selling
everything from soft drinks to computers to potato chips. Now, the
donations are flooding in.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi tops the list of advertisers, but there are plenty of
others as well. There's the company designing the endorsement
campaigns, the incongruously named Teheran Publicity, and the El
Globo bakery chain, the firm presumably providing the pope with his
daily bread. Then there's another bread company with a somewhat
inappropriate name for English-speakers _ Bimbo _ that is
sponsoring 80 massive billboards urging Mexicans to ``feed the
spirit'' of joy.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes Benz is providing two Popemobiles, Hewlett Packard is
donating computer equipment, and a local water firm, Electropura,
is giving away 1.8 million liters of bottled refreshments. In
addition to providing the pope's entourage with portable
telephones, a cellular phone company is giving away 5,000 T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the 25 companies sponsoring the five-day papal visit
to Mexico will cover 75 percent of the trip's expenses through
either money paid for concessions or by donating equipment or
services. In return, the Vatican will grant each participating firm
permission to call itself an ``Official Collaborator.''
</P>
<P>
   In a nation where plastic popes adorn nearly every dashboard,
the sale of religious icons is not unusual. But the unprecedented
extent of the hard-sell has provoked widespread indignation here.
Two-thirds of Mexicans are opposed to the over-commercialization of
the papal visit, according to one newspaper poll.
</P>
<P>
   Many Roman Catholics see such conduct unbecoming to a man deemed
God's Messenger on Earth. The message should be God is love, they
say, not that God loves Pepsi.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church has always denounced consumerism,'' said Luis
Morales Reyes, president of the Mexican Episcopal Conference.
``Therefore one must advise those companies to take a certain
moderation so consumerism doesn't get out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   It might be too late.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the pope's image adorning Pepsi ads, it is also
being tossed into millions of bags of potato chips made by the
Sabritas company, and placed on everything from commemorative coins
to inflatable hats.
</P>
<P>
   Stamps portraying the pope and the Virgin of Guadalupe, Mexico's
Patron Saint, are inside every bag of chips. Consumers are invited
to collect all 10 different stamps and stick each into an album
that can be purchased for only 2 pesos, or 20 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
   Sabritas' chips not only are greasing the palms of consumers. If
all the albums sell, the Catholic church stands to gain $1.8
million, said Sabritas' executives.
</P>
<P>
   The unholy row over the endorsements may be bad news for the
church's image, but it is a blessing for comedians and cartoonists.
</P>
<P>
   One wag rechristened the drink Popesicola. Another asked if the
pope's punishing schedule of endorsements would allow him enough
time to pray.
</P>
<P>
   And given that the Spanish words for Pope and chip are both
papa, the church's spokesman felt it necessary to reassure Mexico's
86.3 million Catholics that the pontiff would not officiate at Mass
dressed as a potato chip.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial deals have certainly lent the trip a unique
flavor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has become an issue because some of the promotions are
done in bad taste,'' said Bernardo Barranco Villafan, president of
the Mexican Center for Religious Studies. ``The Sabritas and Pepsi
campaigns are grotesque.''
</P>
<P>
   Barranco said the church seeks out sponsors to help share the
costs of the papal trips. Normally, the host government pays for a
trip, but Barranco said the Mexican government has severe revenue
problems and so sought corporate partners to help.
</P>
<P>
   Church leaders have put the total cost of the visit in Mexico at
around $2 million, although Mullor and others said they have no
idea how much of that comes from the church's own coffers.
</P>
<P>
   Senior church leaders have declined to comment about how much
the church is making from the endorsements. Instead, they are doing
their best to portray the deals as necessary for the long-term good
of Catholicism in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funds that we are trying to raise are not exactly for the
pope,`` Mullor said. ``It is more than that. We want the (donated
equipment) to remain for posterity. It is very important that it be
used to benefit the (Catholic faith).''

NATIONAL PANEL REVIEWING PSYCHOSIS STUDIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Institute of Mental Health is reviewing more than
100 of its studies, including those that involve using drugs to
induce psychosis, and could suspend some of them for lack of
scientific merit.
</P>
<P>
   The review of the research program, which began more than a year
ago, comes at a time when heightened concern about studies to
induce psychosis and other research involving people with mental
illness has made headlines across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a process of self-improvement for the program, to
bring. . .high standards and new vitality to every protocol. Some
won't be changed, some will be changed,'' said Clarissa Wittenberg,
an NIMH spokeswoman, in an interview Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Wittenberg added that ``there's always that possibility'' that
some studies could be stopped. ``At this point, every single study
and every single patient is being evaluated.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Globe, in a series two months ago, highlighted the
harm done to mentally ill patients who were given drugs to induce
psychosis, or signed up for clinical drug trials without adequate
protections or full informed consent. Some patients committed
suicide. In New York, a current controversy centers around the
death of a mentally ill patient given an experimental antipsychotic
drug.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the journal Science is reporting that NIMH's
director, Dr. Steven E. Hyman, plans to propose at a February
meeting a new review panel that would screen ``high risk'' human
studies proposed by outside researchers before NIMH funds them.
</P>
<P>
   The Science article, which referred to the Globe series as a
``devastating four-part series full of research horror stories,''
also said that earlier this month, the ongoing NIMH review of its
own research program has already led to the suspension of
enrollment of new patients in 29 of 108 clinical experiments. The
review has also led to a request that more than 50 of the
experiments be redesigned to clear up the scientific purpose and
the research subject protections.
</P>
<P>
   NIMH has conducted studies using such drugs as ketamine to
induce psychotic symptoms in people with mental illness and healthy
volunteers in an effort to better understand the biology of
schizophrenia. The federal agency has also funded outside
researchers for such work. Ketamine, a federally approved animal
tranquilizer, is also a powerful hallucinogenic drug of abuse known
as ``Special K.''
</P>
<P>
   But while better understanding schizophrenia may one day improve
treatment of the devastating illness, medical ethicists and others
criticize the studies for failing to fully inform people of the
nature of the research. Critics also raise concerns about the harm
done and question whether induced-psychosis studies in people are
really the best, or only, way to better understand the disease.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear if any of the studies whose enrollment has been
suspended, or whose aims and protections have been questioned, are
among the induced-psychosis experiments.
</P>
<P>
   But some critics of such studies said they have little
confidence that the ongoing NIMH review, or the new review panel to
be proposed by Hyman, is enough to protect vulnerable research
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Vera Hassner Sharav, co-founder of the Citizens for Responsible
Care in Psychiatry and Research, said, ``The problem with all of
this is, this is completely at the discretion of NIMH, so that even
if they come out with guidelines that greatly restrict or that in
fact put a moratorium or prohibit the kinds of experiments that we
don't think should be conducted on human beings. . ., they could at
any time loosen those restrictions.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharav added, ``We need federal regulations that mandate the
stoppage of these kinds of experiments.''
</P>
<P>
   Recommendations for stronger federal research regulations to
protect people with mental illness were made by the National
Bioethics Advisory Commission two months ago, and the next step is
for the White House to act on them.

BANKERS TRUST REPORTS WEAK RESULTS FOR QUARTER AND YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bankers Trust Corp., posting its next-to-last
earnings report before the expected completion of its acquisition
by Deutsche Bank AG, said profit in the fourth quarter plunged 54
percent.
</P>
<P>
   While that marks a distinct turnaround from last year's third
quarter, in which the beleaguered bank reported a loss of $488
million because of trading and lending problems overseas, the
results were still extremely weak.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust said it earned $96 million, or 89 cents a share in
the fourth quarter, down from $207 million, or $1.82 in the same
period a year earlier. But that soundly beat analysts' consensus
estimates of 58 cents a share as tallied by First Call Corp.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, Bankers Trust lost $6 million on revenue of $5.1
billion, compared with profit of $866 million on revenue of $6.2
billion in 1997. In trading Thursday on the New York Stock
Exchange, its shares rose 62.5 cents, to $87.0625.
</P>
<P>
   ``The questions have been what would happen at Bankers Trust to
cause Deutsche Bank to wake up in a cold sweat at 3 in the
morning,'' said Diane Glossman, an analyst at Lehman Brothers Inc.
``I think the numbers weren't great but they were a dramatic
turnaround from the third quarter and should assuage any concerns
about the completion of the merger.''
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust's two largest businesses, investment banking and
trading, both rebounded strongly in the fourth quarter, consistent
with trends in earnings results already announced by other Wall
Street firms.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Analysts said the surprising upturn in the stock market during
the fourth quarter bodes well for Citigroup, which was hurt last
year by problems in its investment banking unit, Salomon Smith
Barney. Citigroup, one of the largest financial services firms,
will report earnings Monday. ``You would think that Citigroup would
be well-positioned to benefit from this trend,'' said Ronald
Mandle, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust continued to be hurt by financial upheaval
overseas. Uncertainty about emerging markets, and the Brazilian
economy in particular, still weighs heavily on all commercial and
investment banks with substantial exposure abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust lost $154 million in Asia in the fourth quarter.
It also lost $45 million in Latin America. Bankers Trust said its
exposure to Asia, Latin America and Russia was $5.4 billion at the
end of 1998, down 54 percent from $11.8 billion at the end of 1997.
It has about $700 million in exposure to Brazil, down from $1.9
billion at the end of 1997.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   BankBoston Corp., another bank with substantial exposure to
Latin America, said its net income in the fourth quarter was $207
million, or 70 cents per share, down 12 percent from $235 million,
or 78 cents per share in the same quarter of 1997. Earnings met
analysts' consensus estimates.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, BankBoston said it earned $792 million on revenue
of $4.4 billion compared with $879 million on revenue of $4 billion
in 1997. BankBoston's shares fell $1.125, or about 2.8 percent, to
$38.75 Thursday on the Big Board.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston has a retail operation in New England and a national
corporate banking business, but has garnered attention lately for
the third pillar of its business: a substantial banking network
based primarily in Brazil and Argentina. BankBoston has about $2.8
billion of assets in those two countries, down from $3.2 billion at
the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The bank said it expected continued growth in Brazil and
Argentina and noted that it had historically benefited from
uncertain times in the region because local customers perceive the
bank as a safe haven for their funds. Nonetheless, BankBoston
tripled its provision for credit losses to $120 million, from $40
million at the end of 1997, although the company said the move
reflected expectations of a weaker U.S. economy this year.  &QL;

CELLUCCI EYES TOBACCO WINDFALL FOR OTHER PROGRAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ If Governor Paul Cellucci gets his way, the state's
$7.6 billion windfall from the national tobacco settlement with
cigarette makers will go toward a health care trust fund for
children, senior citizens, and those with the AIDS virus, instead
of being used for smoking prevention programs.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci made the surprise announcement during a State House
news conference Thursday. The first of 25 installments from the
settlement, about $98 million, is expected to arrive in March and
had been expected to further fund the state's widely acclaimed
anti-smoking programs. Attorney General Scott Harshbarger sued the
tobacco industry partly as way to help stop kids from smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Cellucci said, the money should be used to pay for
those already sick or who have no medical coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to build this fund up so that we can support these
health programs for years to come,'' Cellucci said. ``This
settlement was not intended to be a goodybag.''
</P>
<P>
   While smoking foes said they were concerned Massachusetts will
lose its standing as a national model for reducing smoking and
criticized the governor for refusing to boost the antismoking
funds, Cellucci said at least he is spending the money on health
care.
</P>
<P>
   Other states involved in the settlement have earmarked the money
for a wide variety of projects and programs, some having nothing to
do with smoking or health care.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, for example, the mayor wants to use some of the
tobacco settlement to fix sidewalks; Louisiana wants to pay off
state debt; and Alabama wants to build boot camps for juvenile
delinquents.
</P>
<P>
   Antismoking advocates in Massachusetts were scratching their
heads as to why Cellucci set aside no money for smoking prevention.
Adding to their consternation, Cellucci is calling for a $500,000
study to determine just how effective the Massachusetts Tobacco
Control Program really is.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Connolly, director of that program, could not be reached
for comment. But other smoking foes, including the American Cancer
Society, called Cellucci's actions a slap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really shocking,'' said Richard Daynard, chairman of the
Tobacco Products Liability Project at Northeastern University, a
public health advocacy group that encourages lawsuits against the
industry; Harshbarger officially joined that group Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a program which is arguably the leading program in the
nation. We've turned around the rate of adult smoking and at least
done better on kids smoking than the rest of the country and the
only money that (Cellucci put in) is the money to figure out why it
isn't working. That's all very puzzling.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Al Norman, executive director of Mass Home Care,
praised the proposed trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exactly what we've been waiting for,'' Norman said,
adding that the funding could help between 2,000 and 4,000 elderly
people cut off from Medicare receive home care each month. ``It is
some needed relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Cellucci's plan, every cent of the $7.6 billion in tobacco
funding Massachusetts is expected to receive over the next 25 years
would be placed in a trust fund to expand health care for children,
the elderly, low-income people and those with HIV and the virus it
causes, AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   With a pattern of spending and reinvesting over the next five
years, the fund could swell to $600 million by 2004, according to
the governor's office.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, over the next fiscal year, the tobacco
industry has agreed to pay the state $361 million. After that, the
payments should average $300 million annually. Without a trust fund
set up to receive the payments, the money would otherwise be placed
in the state's general fund.
</P>
<P>
   Under Cellucci's proposal, which will be filed next week as part
of his budget legislation, the settlement money initially fund:
</P>
<P>
   _ A $132 million expansion of a program that provides health
insurance to families;
</P>
<P>
   _ A $20 million investment to help seniors pay for prescription
drugs;
</P>
<P>
   _ A $20 million expansion of home care and elderly housing
programs;
</P>
<P>
   _ A $10 million expansion of HIV/AIDS patient programs;
</P>
<P>
   _ A $13.6 million expansion of a program that provides services
to mentally retarded adults;
</P>
<P>
   _ A $5 million initiative to help the state maximize federal
reimbursements;
</P>
<P>
   _ A $500,000 study to determine how the state Department of
Public Health can best use money for smoking prevention programs.
</P>
<P>
   There is one potential glitch in Cellucci's plan, however.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government may be entitled to about half of the
settlement money to reimburse Medicare spending for smoking related
illnesses. Congress is expected to determine whether the states can
keep all the proceeds in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   US Representative Martin T. Meehan, a Lowell Democrat who chairs
the Congressional Task Forces on Tobacco and Health, said he
believes the states will be allowed to collect the entire
settlement _ under the condition that they set aside some of the
funds for anti-smoking programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tobacco settlement,'' Meehan said, ``shouldn't go to build
sidewalks and prisons.''

BUMPERS URGES SENATE TO HONOR CONSTITUTION BY ACQUITTING CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL, JUDY HOLLAND And JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Retired Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., used his country
lawyer style and constitutional scholarship Thursday to captivate a
divided Senate with a summation of President Clinton's defense
against removal from office that buoyed Senate Democrats' hopes for
quick acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   Bumpers laced his 56-minute wrap-up of the president's three-day
defense with humorous quips and tales from small town lawyer days
in his native Arkansas that unleashed laughter across a somber
Senate conducting the first impeachment trial of a president since
1868.
</P>
<P>
   Bumpers, a 24-year Senate veteran who retired only three weeks
ago, appealed directly to Republican conservatives in the Senate
with his argument that the Senate would honor the Constitution by
acquitting Clinton because his ``indefensible, outrageous,
unforgivable, shameless'' personal conduct in the Monica Lewinsky
sex scandal was not a crime against the nation that requires
removal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here today because the president suffered a terrible
moral lapse, a marital infidelity; not a breach of the public
trust, not a crime against society,'' Bumpers declared. ``You can
censure Bill Clinton; you can hand him over to the prosecutor for
him to be prosecuted; but you cannot convict him.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats said they detected a change in the political
atmosphere in the Republican-led Senate following Bumpers'
summation, Clinton's triumphant State of the Union address Tuesday
evening and the appeal of Christian Right activist Pat Robertson
for the Senate to end the trial and focus instead on the problems
facing the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people now and for some time have been asking to
be allowed a good night's sleep,'' Bumpers implored. ``They're
asking for an end to this nightmare. It is a legitimate request.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill.,
pleaded for the Senate to permit House prosecutors to call
witnesses to rebut the president's defense against the impeachment
charges of perjury and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde warned the Senate that it would be ``a mistake to rush to
judgment'' and ``short-circuit'' House prosecutors' efforts to
rebut the president's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people wish we would just go away,'' Hyde declared.
``But we can't because the law won't let us and our sense of duty
won't let us. We're going to see this thing through until they shut
the door on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., signaled that the
GOP-led Senate, with 55 Republican senators, would likely summon
witnesses because ``clearly there are conflicts in what has been
said by the House managers and the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott said the Senate would discuss calling witnesses for private
depositions or public testimony on Monday. Senators will use Friday
and Saturday to submit written questions to the House prosecutors
and White House lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The White House opposes calling witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, conceding that up to 35 Senate Democrats may already be
ready to vote to end the trial, warned that it would be
``premature'' to end the trial without clarifying disputes between
witnesses' testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``For any senator to say next Monday, `I don't want to know what
the depositions would say, I don't want to hear what the witnesses
say,' I think that would be a hard decision to defend,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., said the trial should not be hurried,
noting: ``As important as handling this in an expeditious manner
is, we've got to do justice.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Jim M. Jeffords, R-Vt., said the Senate continues to
look for ``an exit strategy that is a reasonable length of time,''
adding: ``There's a feeling that we've heard enough and there
really is not much more we can learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats seeking quick resolution of the year-long
Lewinsky affair said that Bumpers' presentation enhanced their
chances for curtailing the Senate trial without prolonged testimony
by witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said he was ``more optimistic
today that we might be able to end this with some dispatch and not
have it drag on for months than I have been for months.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said the Senate was ``closer to a rapid
close of these charges than we were a week ago,'' adding: ``If this
president is acquitted tomorrow we go back to the nation's business
but if the president is convicted and removed from office, who
knows what turmoil will go on in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., said he saw ``some evidence that some
Republicans are rethinking evidence,'' adding: ``Two days ago I
thought witnesses were inevitable. I think that has changed some.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn., a former Democratic party
chairman, said ``there's a growing sense here that we want to come
to closure'' with a growing number of senators ``who feel we've
heard enough and want to wrap it up.''

</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans pressing for a full Senate trial downplayed
the impact of Robertson's remarks. Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala.
called Robertson a ``big outside voice'' that should be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats seized upon Robertson's comments to suggest that
support was crumbling for Republicans to continue the trial. Sen.
Richard J. Durbin, D-Ill., said Robertson's comments ``have given
(Senate Republicans) an out.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga., said Robertson's appeal ``may have
given the Republicans some cover'' for ending the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Lott merely said that ``Dale always gives a good speech.''
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, called
Bumpers' remarks ``a fun, nice way to wind it up but I don't think
it will change many viewpoints.''

   Officials at the White House sounded upbeat. White House Press
Secretary Joe Lockhart quipped that Clinton would gladly cease his
daily practice of staging White House events showing him at work on
the nation's business if the Senate ended the trial. ``If that's
the price, we'll pay it,'' Lockhart said.

ROBERTSON'S REMARKS DRAW FIRE AT CONSERVATIVE PAC MEETING
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Va.) (bl) 
By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALEXANDRIA, Va. _ Pat Robertson's remarks that the impeachment
trial might as well be halted set off a firestorm among
conservatives meeting here Thursday. They condemned the television
evangelist and asserted that Republicans should not retreat from a
full trial.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there were indications at the annual conference of the
Conservative Political Action Committee that some of the most
vociferous detractors of President Clinton are pulling back from
the impeachment controversy. Few of the speakers concentrated on
impeachment or on the president's ethics _ a departure from similar
gatherings recently. Two candidates seeking the Republican
presidential nomination _ publishing magnate Steve Forbes and
former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander _ preferred to take shots at
the early front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, rather than
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   And several conservatives at the convention _ the same setting
where Paula Jones first emerged in 1994 to tell reporters that she
fended off a sexual advance from Clinton _ said they shared
Robertson's impatience with how the White House scandal has
dominated the capital. For example, Joyce Terry, a retired nurse
from Woodbridge, Va., said she agreed with him: ``That's my
concern. I feel they should move a little faster. They know the
facts. They know what's going on. Let's get with it and get it over
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite those misgivings, the overwhelming sentiment of dozens
of rank-and-file conservatives and their leaders was that the
Senate has a duty to pursue Clinton no matter the political
consequences. Most people said they were puzzled _ if not outraged
_ by the comments Wednesday by Robertson, the chairman of the
Christian Coalition, that Clinton had won ``from a public relations
standpoint'' and ``they might as well dismiss'' the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Pat Robertson said, in fact, it's time for the Republicans
to give up _ and give in _ to Clinton, my membership in the
Christian Coalition is over,'' said Hazel Staloff, a computer
worker from Brooklyn. ``I don't think the party can be hurt when it
stands for what is right. It can only be hurt when it compromises
with evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Kroeger, a former staff member in the Reagan White
House, said of Robertson, ``I think he should have kept quiet
because he carried a lot of weight with conservatives. I don't know
why he said that because Congress has a duty there. To drop it,
where does that leave us?''
</P>
<P>
   The feelings of this potent wing of the Republican Party are
important because many politicians, particularly in competitive
races, are loath to alienate conservatives whom they need to get
elected.
</P>
<P>
   Across the river at the Capitol, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the
lead prosecutor, said Robertson's comments ``shows that we're not
tools of the Christian Right. We don't necessarily always agree
with everything that Pat Robertson says.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Robertson sought to defend his comments on his television
program, ``The 700 Club'': ``What I was saying essentially is that
the president scored a public-relations triumph, and the
Republicans in the Congress gave him the platform to do that, and
consequently they undercut their own authority.'' He added: ``In a
sense, it's like saying it's the third quarter and the score is 50
to nothing and there's another quarter to play. The outcome seems
at this point settled, but I wasn't saying I favored that.''
</P>
<P>
   In Virginia, many participants at this conference said they
favored a full trial with a parade of witnesses. ``It doesn't
matter to me if it goes on for a year,'' said Dan O'Brien of Falls
Church, who teaches character to corporate executives. ``I'm not
deceived by the notion that the country's going to stop running
because of the impeachment trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Mingling among vendors selling T-shirts with slogans such as
``Another Member of the Vast Right Wing Conspiracy,'' Preston
Noell, who heads a Catholic civic organization said he was eager
for the Senate to delve deeper into the impeachment matter. ``I'm
not sick and tired of it,'' he said. ``I don't think it's gotten
going yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Helen Chenoweth, R-Idaho, an outspoken conservative who
addressed the convention, said of Robertson after her speech: ``I
was surprised. We wouldn't have even fought the war of independence
if we had taken a poll.''
</P>
<P>
   David Keene, chairman of the American Conservative Union, said
flatly of Robertson: ``He's wrong.'' But he conceded that
``conservatives are of two minds _ they want it to go through the
process, but they'd like it to be over to the extent that it's all
that's talked about. Conservatives have always won when we can make
divisions based on the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The presidential candidates also stayed relatively clear of
Clinton. Without mentioning him directly, Forbes assailed Bush and
his ``compassionate conservative'' ideology, saying,
``Mealy-mouthed rhetoric and poll-tested cliches are no substitute
for a muscular substantive agenda.'' Forbes and Alexander also
attacked Bush by criticizing his father, former President George
Bush, and his slogan about a ``kinder and gentler'' America.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, a social conservative who is also preparing to run
for president, took issue with Robertson in an interview. ``There
are two issues that ought never have to do with PR,'' he said.
``Declaring war and the profound question of whether the president
has violated the Constitution.''

HUMAN TISSUES MAY BE INTERCONVERTIBLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Italy, Canada)  (mk) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a bizarre experiment that demonstrates the surprising
plasticity of the body's cells, scientists have converted mice's
brain cells into blood cells.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation has medical significance because if the human
body's tissues should prove to be as interconvertible, patients'
tissues might be repaired from their own cells.
</P>
<P>
   The mouse result was obtained with neural stem cells, cells that
have the ability to form the three main types of cell found in the
brain. Each organ of the body is thought to have its own brand of
stem cells that generate all the organ's specialized cell types.
</P>
<P>
   But until now, the stem cells were thought to be committed to
their own organ type and unable to cross over.
</P>
<P>
   A team of Italian and Canadian scientists, led by Dr. Angelo
Vescovi of the National Neurological Institute in Milan, Italy, has
now found that the neural stem cells can metamorphose into the
blood-making stem cells of the bone marrow.
</P>
<P>
   Vescovi's team gave mice sublethal doses of radiation to destroy
their own blood-making cells, and then injected neural stem cells
from other mice whose cells carried an identifying genetic tag. The
neural stem cells found their way to the mice's bone marrow and
started producing various types of blood cells bearing the genetic
tag of the donor mouse, the scientists report in Friday's issue of
Science.
</P>
<P>
   The conversion of neural stem cells into blood cells is
particularly surprising because brain and blood come from different
germ layers created in the early embryo. Almost the first visible
structures in animal embryos are three primary sheets of cells,
known as the ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm, from which all the
tissues of the adult body develop. The brain develops from the
ectoderm and blood from the mesoderm. Vescovi's work defies the
widely held assumption that cells in the three lineages are
permanently committed to their fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is that trinity that is now being challenged,'' said Ronald
McKay, a brain cell expert at the National Institutes of Health.
McKay said the new result showed that differentiation, the
commitment of a cell to a specific fate, is not irreversible. ``You
have to look at the combination of signals that is imposed on a
cell. It's the environment that determines what a cell does.''
</P>
<P>
   Vescovi said he did not know the chemical signals to which the
neural stem cells were responding but assumed they were influenced
by local cues in the devastated bone marrow calling for more cells.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists who work with stem cells hold high hopes for using
them in medicine. Stem cells, after all, are the natural source of
new cells when a tissue needs to repair itself.
</P>
<P>
   The human embryonic stem cells whose first isolation was
reported last November have been seen as a promising source of new
tissue. The embryonic stem cells can give rise to all 250 cell
types of the body and in particular to the lower-level stem cells
that generate each organ of the body.
</P>
<P>
   But there are ethical considerations in using embryonic stem
cells because the cells are derived by destroying an embryo. Also,
the cells would not be immunologically compatible with a patient
unless manipulated in ways that have yet to be devised.
</P>
<P>
   Vescovi's work suggests that ordinary stem cells, from the skin
or blood perhaps, could be acquired from the patient, thus avoiding
any immune rejection problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think you can use skin stem cells to make other cells,''
Vescovi said. If so, skin stem cells could be harvested from a
patient, and inserted into the bone marrow to make blood cells, or
into the brain to make the cells lost in Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Vescovi believes a new branch of medicine is about to develop
from stem cell biology. ``The resource to heal a sick body lies in
the body itself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The recent cloning of animals such as mice and sheep is also an
example of the new plasticity being recognized in cells. In those
cases, the nucleus of a fully specialized cell was reprogrammed
after being inserted into an egg cell. In Vescovi's work, the
body's own local signals apparently converted the neural stem cells
to a new role.
</P>
<P>
   The plasticity of all these cells is possible because every cell
contains a full set of the human genes or genome. Each type of cell
presumably activates its own subset of genes, with all the others
being switched off.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists have long assumed the off-switches were put in place
early in an organism's development. It now seems that the state of
a stem cell's differentiation is more of a dynamic matter,
depending on whatever mix of signals it receives in its local
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Stem cells have become accessible to study only in the last 10
years or so. Distinguishing them from other cells required finding
markers on their cell surface for which an immune-based tag could
be developed. Once isolated, the cells have proved extremely
unstable, either dying or developing into specialized cell types.
In the body, their behavior is determined by the many cells
surrounding them, a fact that must be taken into account in
cultivating them.

 &HT;    New firm helps manage home wireless chores
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a Manhattan building owned by its patron Lucent
Technologies, Home Wireless Networks today is slated to unveil its
first products to analysts, reporters and potential customers.
</P>
<P>
   The event marks a critical moment for the Norcross company, the
first chance to prove that tens of millions of dollars in
investment are likely to reap a far greater reward in sales and
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Founded by several Atlanta tech veterans and funded by Lucent
and several venture capitalists, Home Wireless Networks aims to
take advantage of the growing hunger for both communication devices
and wireless ways to connect them.
</P>
<P>
   If company officials and backers are right, that market will be
huge.
</P>
<P>
   The Home Wireless systems, which will be sold at first through
the company's Web site (http://www.homewireless.com), allow a user
to manage computers, wired phones, wireless phones, fax machines
and pretty much any device that can be fitted with a wireless
transmitter.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to provide flexibility, but also to get the most out
of available phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   For example, many homeowners with computers and a fax machine
might use one line for a computer, a second for the fax and a third
for the phone.
</P>
<P>
   But by playing traffic cop, the Home Wireless system might let a
user get by with two lines, linking only the devices in use.
</P>
<P>
   All the phone lines coming into the home or business would
connect to a Home Wireless switch. Because other devices would be
transmitted wirelessly, a user could move those machines anywhere _
a fax in the basement, a phone in the garage, a laptop computer out
on the deck _ and then move them again. Through their wireless
connections to the switch, all the devices would remain on a local
area network.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for more lines seems clear. For several years,
second- and third-lines have accounted for much of the growth of
the local phone companies. For instance, BellSouth has repeatedly
reported double-digit growth in additional lines.
</P>
<P>
   John Taylor, company president and chief executive, said the
Home Wireless approach is aimed at consumers contending with
multiple lines and phones, as well as for small offices.
</P>
<P>
   That target market is massive _ accounting for 68 percent of all
revenue to phone and Internet access companies, he said.

 &HT;    Delta could eye America West, too
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ United Airlines' pursuit of America West rekindles
speculation about consolidation in the industry _ and how
Atlanta-based Delta will be involved.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe Delta's top brass also has looked at
Phoenix-based America West and may still consider pursuing the
carrier, either through acquisition or alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Delta did not reveal its intentions Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize the industry is changing, and we're watching the
situation closely, but it's inappropriate for us to comment,''
spokeswoman Jackie Pate said.
</P>
<P>
   America West has periodically been rumored as a potential buyout
target for a bigger carrier. Its chairman, William Franke, recently
told Bloomberg News he ``would love to talk'' to Delta or United.
</P>
<P>
   United announced its interest in a buyout late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they (Delta executives) are taking a look at
everything,'' said analyst Ray Neidl of ING Barings Furman Selz.
</P>
<P>
   ``From some standpoints, Delta's system matches well with
America West's, and they lose some overall market position if it
goes to someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I also get the feeling Delta's busy tending their own
store,'' Neidl added.
</P>
<P>
   America West is the ninth-largest U.S. carrier, with a 2.8
percent national market share among the 10 major carriers. In 1994,
it emerged from three years under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
The carrier logged a $108.6 million profit for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Its Phoenix hub and route network would strengthen United in the
West, where rival American Airlines recently bought the small
carrier Reno Air. United also could shift some America West
aircraft to Washington D.C., where it is boosting operations at
Dulles Airport.
</P>
<P>
   But any bid for America West faces hurdles. Continental Airlines
already has marketing links with the carrier, as well as right of
first refusal over the sale of America West stock controlled by
financier David Bonderman, also a major holder of Continental
stock.
</P>
<P>
   If United pursues a buyout, Continental will ``assert our rights
and make the best decision for our shareholders,'' Continental CEO
Gordon Bethune said Thursday. Bethune also predicted antitrust
obstacles, saying the chance of a United-America West merger ``is
closer to zero than any other number.''
</P>
<P>
   America West's availability follows a wave of alliance activity
in 1998:
</P>
<P>
   _ Continental is pursuing an extensive business partnership with
Northwest Airlines, a deal it launched last winter after Bonderman
sought to cash out his stake.
</P>
<P>
   _ Delta, under new CEO Leo Mullin, made a buyout bid for
Continental, but the offer was spurned.
</P>
<P>
   _ Delta then entered into an alliance with United that links the
two carriers' frequent flier programs. A more extensive deal,
involving joint seat sales, was initially planned but was tabled
because of pilot union issues.
</P>
<P>
   If United now buys America West, it could be a stronger alliance
partner for Delta.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Delta and United remain separate competitors,
and a stronger United poses a challenge, especially if the
acquisition propels its buildup in the East.
</P>
<P>
   If Delta seeks a link with America West, it would be drawn
chiefly by the lure of a stronger position in the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Delta has connecting hubs in Dallas-Fort Worth and Salt Lake
City but neither is ideal and the airline has cut flights at both
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   America West's fleet is composed mainly of Boeing 757s and 737s,
both of which Delta uses extensively. But it also includes Airbus
A320 jets, and Delta does not fly any Airbus planes. United flies
all three types.
</P>
<P>
   Neidl said he prefers airline alliances to mergers, which often
produce difficult labor and operational issues. ``I don't like
them. They're sloppy,'' he said. ``Alliances are a much better way
to go.''
</P>
<P>
   America West stock had its biggest one-day gain ever Thursday,
rising $3.56 1/4 to $23.06 1/4. The stock is up 36 percent since
Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Delta shares closed down $1.43 3/4 at $50.37 1/2, while UAL
Corp., the parent of United, closed down $1.18 3/4 at $60.

   AUSTIN _ For the first time since 1986, U.S. District Judge
William Wayne Justice on Thursday heard testimony from Texas prison
inmates who recounted being raped, beaten, extorted and robbed by
fellow convicts _ and ridiculed or ignored when they complained to
corrections officers.
</P>
<P>
   Justice instructed the inmates to ``make a careful account'' of
any retaliation against them when they get back to their prison
units. He said he would ask the FBI to investigate any
recriminations as obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen inmates told of being intimidated from the day they
set foot in prison and they described a system that failed to
prevent their humiliating sexual assaults and rarely punished their
violators. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``They believe I make the whole race look bad,'' said a white
inmate, who claimed he was ostracized by other whites after he was
raped in separate incidents by black and Hispanic prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony came on the first day of a three-week hearing for
Justice to consider whether the 140,000-inmate Texas prison system
should be &UR;  &LR; removed from the court-ordered supervision it has been
under since 1981, when Justice ruled that the system
unconstitutionally was crowded.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a class-action lawsuit filed in 1972 by inmate David
Ruiz, Justice in the mid-1980s issued orders and approved
settlement agreements that still regulate the daily life of Texas'
inmates.
</P>
<P>
   But prompted by lawmakers and the state's newly sworn-in top
lawyer, &UR;  &LR; Justice is pondering whether to terminate his role in the
case, which he largely relinquished in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Also, last year the 77-year-old judge went on senior status,
leaving his bench in Tyler for Austin, where he has taken a reduced
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General John Cornyn, who took office three weeks ago,
opened the proceeding by declaring that the system ``long ago
achieved the goals that this court set for us. After nearly 20
years of federal court supervision, Texas should regain the right _
and responsibility _ to govern its own prison system.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice has indicated he will issue a ruling a few weeks after
hearing testimony from inmates, experts and state officials.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Coleman, Cornyn's solicitor general, told the judge that
the state will show that dramatic improvements have been made since
the Ruiz case was tried. Crowding has been reduced through a
multibillion-dollar prison building program; inmates no longer
sleep on floors; inmate-to-staff ratios are close to national
norms; guards are better trained; use of force against inmates is
more thoughtful and less frequent; and medical care has improved
radically.
</P>
<P>
   As Coleman recited how health care had improved, Justice
interjected his own recollection that there was a time when inmates
not only served as nurses but were allowed to perform surgery.
</P>
<P>
   And even with better conditions overall, Coleman conceded that
``bad things have happened'' in some prisons, but he urged Justice
to discount any suggestions of a state-sponsored ``conspiracy'' to
deny inmates their constitutional rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have come a long ways,'' Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   Not far enough, countered inmates' attorney, Donna Brorby of San
Francisco, who said her clients are ``the unseen and the unheard.''
</P>
<P>
   She said a policy of ``deliberate indifference'' toward inmates'
needs causes them ``unconscionable suffering,'' and sometimes leads
to premature death, especially for those with AIDS, diabetes,
cancer and heart problems.
</P>
<P>
   She estimated that 30 percent to 60 percent of the inmates get
``poor'' or ``very poor'' health care, including inadequate
assessments and delays in treatment.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brorby subpoenaed dozens of inmates. The first of them told of
being threatened by gang members upon their arrival in prison and
of promptly being raped, robbed and forced to pay for protection _
either with commissary credits or sexual favors. One inmate
described how he was recruited by a corrections officer to deliver
contraband tobacco to inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the testifying inmates said they were moved from one
prison or wing to another after they filed complaints or pleaded
for help. But all agreed that they never were free from danger
because complaining got them branded ``snitches'' and their
reputations followed them wherever they went.
</P>
<P>
   Two child molesters testified that guards offered them no help
when they asked for protection against predatory inmates who
routinely abused pedophiles.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A mentally impaired inmate said he was so distraught about being
sexually victimized that he threatened suicide _ and a guard
offered to provide him a razor blade to slash his wrists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing has been done for me. They weren't going to get me
help. They don't care ... just don't give a damn,'' the inmate told
Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz, the inmate from Travis County who started the long-running
case, remains incarcerated near Huntsville at the Estelle Unit,
where he is serving a life term for aggravated robbery and
aggravated perjury. He is not expected to testify.

has demonstrated a rare gift for capturing both the cultural power
of rock music and the absurdity of being a rock star. In ``Still
Crazy,'' he returns to this same territory, but in a much gentler
and more whimsical frame of mind, and the result, while perhaps
more glib and superficial than his earlier two rock films, is so
incorrigibly good-natured and completely likable that it's
impossible to resist.

EVEN WITHOUT AN ELECTION, CLINTON CANNOT STOP CAMPAIGNING 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bill Clinton has answered the question chewed over
by his aides and friends after his last election: What would this
instinctual campaigner do without another election?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that he is running again for his second term, as
hard as he can.
</P>
<P>
   The president dispatched his lawyers and his old friend Dale
Bumpers to the Senate this week to slug away at the charges against
him and sometimes at his own behavior. As they bemoaned his lapses,
Clinton was reintroducing _ or re-reintroducing _ a very different
man: a bold, vigorous, optimistic leader with a mighty smart wife
and solutions to problems most Americans may not even see coming.
Sound familiar?
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from Clinton's dog-eared political playbook, the
combination of a free-swinging legal defense and daily policy
announcements culminating in the State of the Union address has
rocked Republicans back on their heels, for the moment anyway, and
emboldened Democratic senators to talk of seeking dismissal of the
charges as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   But even if that move succeeded, it would not end this campaign,
which unlike the one in 1996 has no election day to ring down the
curtain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now there are three hurdles, three endings: impeachment, his
presidency and the judgments people will make on it,'' said George
Stephanopoulos, the former Clinton aide. ``It's really three
campaigns in one.''
</P>
<P>
   And as Stephanopoulos noted, each of those campaigns will not be
decided by the popular approval Clinton has so ably courted _
though that can only help. ``Even if the country supports the
policies by 80 percent,'' he said, ``it doesn't mean they'll get
through the Congress, it doesn't mean it'll stop impeachment, it
doesn't mean the historians will say he was a succesful president
after all.''
</P>
<P>
   In summing up the president's case to the Senate on Thursday,
Bumpers called his conduct ``indefensible, outrageous,
unforgivable, shameless.'' He portrayed him as wracked by his
affair with Monica Lewinsky and the agony it has caused his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relationship between husband and wife, father and child,
has been incredibly strained, if not destroyed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday evening, Clinton provided a milder
appraisal. ``I would say it has been a strain for my family,'' he
said, ``but we have worked very hard, and I think we've, we've come
through the worst period. We love each other very much, and we've
worked on it very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, what was said to the Senate is not what the Clintons
show to the world. Thursday, the Clintons shared a White House
podium, where each nostalgically recalled their lengthy partnership
in improving education.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton may be campaigning harder because of the threat to his
presidency and the damage to his reputation caused by his affair.
But in spinning off new initiatives and flogging them relentlessly,
his current and former aides insist, he is just doing what comes
naturally. This is what he loves to do, and it is how he governs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a central part of his nature and his conception of the
job,'' one of Clinton's senior aides said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. He pointed with pride to a page-long list of Clinton
proposals, marveling that, ``You've got to go to agate type and two
columns to list all of your policy initiatives in the seventh year
of your presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican congressmen are scrambling to put forward their own
agenda of tax cuts and other ideas, but they are unable to draw the
kind of focused media attention that the president can take for
granted.
</P>
<P>
   Even if news reports are dominated by the Senate trial,
Clinton's aides note, they inevitably refer to the president's
public doings that day. Those doings, they say, will continue to be
about matters like education, weapons control, economics and crime.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that Clinton will be able to complete his term, his
aides are starting to look past the trial, in hopes of seizing the
political initiative. They must decide such questions as whether to
push for education legislation right away or to embark on an
immediate battle over Social Security versus tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Used to the rhythm of the Washington calendar by now, they are
looking ahead to annual events like the conferences of mayors and
governors, to schedule high-profile speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides have repeatedly compared the scale of his agenda
this year with the hefty one he presented in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   But in terms of execution, this campaign is shaping up more like
the one in 1996, when Clinton appeared in tightly choreographed
events to promote discrete initiatives. He is planning to insist
that most of the surplus should be reserved for Social Security and
Medicare _ just as he argued in 1996 that Republican tax cutting
would damage those popular programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's forced them into a play where if they do their tax cut
they have to cut both Social Security and Medicare,'' said Rahm
Emanuel, a Clinton aide whom the president called back to
Washington last weekend to help prepare for his speech. ``And I
know how that movie ends. There's a shootout, and the good guys
win.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Thursday, the president began a day-by-day campaign to plug
proposals individually, leading up to the presentation of his
budget on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   At an appearance in the Old Executive Office Building next to
the White House, the president was introduced by Arthur Moore, a
soldier-turned-teacher from Baltimore. Clinton stood before a navy
blue sign emblazoned with flags, apples and A-pluses as he talked
about the lessons in hard work and teamwork learned from his
high-school band leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Research confirms what most of us know from our own
experience,'' Clinton said. ``What most determines whether students
learn is not family background or even dollars spent per pupil, but
the talent, the ability and the dedication of their teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke in a cramped amphitheater that until this week was
known simply by its room number, 450. It has been renamed
``Presidential Hall,'' lending a grander cast to the president's
events there. On Thursday, outside Presidential Hall, a sign noted
that ``the Intern Speaker Series'' had been canceled for the day.

MICROSOFT AND THE QUESTION OF MONOPOLY
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The judge in the Microsoft antitrust trial asked
the company's expert witness on economics a series of skeptical
questions Thursday, suggesting that Microsoft Corp. may have
difficulty with one of its defenses _ that it does not have a
monopoly in the market for personal computer operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson interrupted when a Microsoft
lawyer was questioning Richard Schmalensee, an economist and dean
of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of
Management, about the price Microsoft charges for its
industry-standard Windows operating system. Schmalensee was
explaining his view that the modest price Microsoft charges for
Windows, typically less than 5 percent of the cost of a personal
computer, indicated a company concerned about current and potential
competition instead of the predatory monopolist the government has
tried to paint for the court.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson cut in to ask if there could be sound business
reasons that even a monopolist might charge less today ``in search
of larger glory at some later date.''
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate his point, the judge spoke of the hypothetical
case of a cigarette company that might keep its prices low to hook
generations of future smokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't any indication,'' Schmalensee replied, ``that
Windows is that kind of addiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson seemed unconvinced. ``Do you have kids?'' he asked
Schmalensee.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the MIT dean replied, ``but not all kids use Windows, your
honor. Some use Macs,'' a reference to Apple Computer Inc.'s
Macintosh machines, which run the Mac operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's occasional questions are scrutinized by both sides
as a possible clue to his thinking. This is not a jury trial, so at
least at the U.S. District Court level, Jackson will determine the
outcome of the case. Legal experts say that queries from the bench
do not foreshadow a verdict but do suggest the issues a judge is
focusing on when weighing testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Microsoft has a monopoly in the market for personal
computer operating systems is not directly at issue in this case.
The Justice Department and 19 states are not suing Microsoft for
having a monopoly but for illegally using its market muscle to
defend and extend the reach of its monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if Microsoft can convince the court that it is not a
monopoly, the government's case collapses.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning from Richard Urowsky, a Microsoft lawyer,
Schmalensee explained that his key assumption in explaining the
company's business practices _ its pricing, investment spending and
deals _ is that it lives in an industry characterized by ``dynamic
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike old smokestack industries, Schmalensee said, the software
business requires even the incumbent leaders to move quickly, to
keep prices low and to innovate continually. ``Microsoft is
constantly concerned with being displaced as a leader,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The government argues that Microsoft's behavior is that of a
modern monopolist. It is in a fast-moving high-technology business,
the government concedes, but its monopoly position is nonetheless
resilient partly because of the reluctance of consumers to switch
operating systems once they have taken the time and trouble to
figure out Windows, which runs on more than 90 percent of personal
computers sold. This kind of self-reinforcing dependency _ ``high
switching costs,'' in economic terms _ was what Jackson was
alluding to with his cigarette-monopoly example.
</P>
<P>
   The government contends that Microsoft used exclusionary
contracts with personal computer makers and others to unfairly
shield its monopoly from the threat posed by the Internet
generally, but especially by Netscape Communications Corp., the
pioneer in software for browsing the World Wide Web, and Sun
Microsystems Inc., the creator of Java, an Internet programming
language.
</P>
<P>
   But Schmalensee testified that even if one assumes that
Microsoft is indeed a monopoly, there is no convincing evidence
that Microsoft did anything to restrict the distribution of
Netscape's browsing software.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has introduced documents showing that
some PC makers complained when Microsoft imposed new contract
restrictions in 1996 that limited their freedom to do as they
please with the first desktop screen that appears when users turn
on their machines. The PC makers would prefer a free hand in
selling that valuable commercial real estate to software makers,
including Microsoft's rivals, to load their icons.
</P>
<P>
   But Schmalensee testified that those restrictions were mostly
modest, like limiting the size of icons that can be displayed.
Microsoft, he added, typically uses for its own software seven of
the available 49 spaces for desktop icons.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is lots of room for PC makers to put on other icons, so
Microsoft does not limit software distribution through the
desktop,'' Schmalensee said.
</P>
<P>
   The government replies that by bundling its browser with Windows
and giving it away free, Microsoft used its monopoly to give its
browser an unfair edge and drive up the distribution costs of
Netscape.

COMMENTARY: THE GRAND BARGAIN
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Listening to President Clinton's perfectly focus-grouped State
of the Union speech the other night, I really felt sort of cheated.
I mean, he left almost no constituency untickled by his 77-minute
goody-bag of proposals. There was something for older women,
younger women, black women, tall women, short women, soccer moms,
soccer coaches, native Americans, Hispanics, non-smokers,
free-traders, short bald men and protectionists. Even the first
lady got ``I love you.'' There was something for everyone except me
_ except for foreign-affairs columnists who still care about things
like Russian nuclear weapons aimed at us.
</P>
<P>
   No, no, you say, the president declared that ``We must expand
our work with Russia to safeguard nuclear materials.'' But I
thought that was a laugh line. After all, for the last five years
Clinton has had a signed treaty on the table with the Russians _
Start 2 _ that would require Moscow to slash the number of its
long-range nuclear warheads aimed at us, from around 6,000 to
3,000. But the Clinton team chose to trade Russia's immediate
ratification of Start 2 for NATO expansion. That's right, they
traded the elimination of 3,000 Russian warheads for the Polish air
force and the Czech navy!
</P>
<P>
   Had the president really wanted to tickle the foreign policy
community, he had a great opportunity the other night to offer a
strategic ``GRAND BARGAIN'' that might actually unlock the really
dangerous deadlock in global arms control today.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the problem: Start 2 ratification is stuck in the Russian
parliament, largely because of the NATO issue; U.S. ratification of
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty _ which would ban all nuclear
testing _ is being held up by Senate Republicans; and the
Republican demands for a full-scale U.S. ballistic missile shield
is being held up by the White House and the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the deal Clinton could have offered in his speech:
</P>
<P>
   ``Now listen up, y'all. We Democrats want you Republicans to
ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty so we can prevent any more
countries from going nuclear. We don't need to test anymore,
because we can do it all by computer simulation, and this treaty
would not only get the signatories to stop testing but finally get
India and Pakistan to stop too. We Democrats also want you
Republicans to let us start reducing our current nuclear arsenal
below 8,500 warheads, toward Start 2 levels, even though the
Russians haven't ratified Start 2 yet, because we simply don't need
all these nukes, some of which are becoming obsolete. We could save
millions of dollars by retiring them now. But you Republicans
passed a law blocking that until Russia ratifies Start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meanwhile, you guys want us to spend a gazillion dollars
developing a ballistic missile defense shield, which, given where
Iraq and North Korea are heading, probably has merit. But we
Democrats don't want to spend all that money yet. And we also don't
want to alienate the Russians by violating the 1972 Antiballistic
Missile Treaty, which bars such missile defense systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``So here's what I'm offering: You Republicans ratify the Test
Ban Treaty now and let us start reducing our nuclear arsenal to
Start 2 levels. Eventually the Russians will go there, and half
their nukes don't work anyway. In return, I will support expanded
funding for a ballistic missile defense system and I will ask
Secretary Albright when she goes to Moscow on Sunday to open
discussions with the Russians on modifying the ABM treaty to allow
for missile defenses. If the Russians tell us they don't want to
modify ABM, because they can't afford a missile defense system,
we'll offer to work with them on a system that gives them early
warning against a rogue attack and assures them that our missile
shield won't threaten them. That was actually a Ronald Reagan idea.
I'll also tell Ms. Albright to whisper in Yeltsin's ear that there
won't be any more NATO expansion for a while, so the Russian
parliament can finally ratify Start 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``You Republicans want us to stem the spread of nuclear weapons.
So do I. But the question is how. We need to be smart. If we don't
take the lead in stopping nuclear testing and reducing our own
arsenal, we'll have no credibility demanding that India and
Pakistan do it. So you give us the tools we need to fight
proliferation and I'll get us the tools we need to shield us from
the rogues with missiles. And Sammy Sosa says he'll throw in
autographed baseballs for everyone who goes along. How about it? We
got a deal?''

AGENCY ANNOUNCES PLANS TO SPEED UP CITIZENSHIP APPLICATION
PROCESS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   One year after the Immigration and Naturalization Service
pledged to reduce the backlog of almost 2 million people waiting to
become Americans, the agency has announced that it will hire 300
more employees and create a national hot line to help prospective
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came days before President Clinton said in the
State of the Union address this week that his budget proposal would
``expand significantly'' the efforts to chip away at the
unprecedented backlog of people waiting to become American
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our new immigrants must be part of our `One America,''' the
president said on Tuesday night. ``We have a responsibility to make
them welcome here, and they have a responsibility to enter the
mainstream of American life.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria Echeveste, a deputy chief of staff who helped to draft the
president's address, said this newest proposal to improve
naturalization efforts builds on the $171 million requested by the
White House last year and later approved by Congress. Ms. Echeveste
said that it was not yet clear how much the president would propose
to spend this time.
</P>
<P>
   Among the new initiatives, the one likely to have the most
immediate impact is the hiring of 200 employees to review
citizenship applications, interview applicants and make decisions.
They will be deployed to the cities with the largest backlogs. Los
Angeles, with 412,558 people waiting, has the nation's largest
backlog and will receive 56 new positions. New York, which has
314,976 people in line, will be able to hire 40 new employees. San
Francisco will get 35; Miami, 25; Chicago, 15; Boston, 11; Houston,
10, and Dallas, 8.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 100 immigration information officers will be sent
to the four regional centers where citizenship applications are
received and processed in California, Vermont, Nebraska and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The agency will also develop a national telephone hot line to
answer questions about eligibility for citizenship, application
procedures and individual case status. And, in a move that
immigration officials hope will eliminate one of the biggest
complaints against the agency, lost files, all 25 million paper
files that are currently scattered in 80 offices across the country
will be sent to one central office that will be established in
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials said they expected the measures to cut in
half the waiting time for obtaining citizenship. Most immigrants
now wait about two years, but some have been waiting since 1995. By
the end of this year, the wait should be down to a year, officials
said. By the end of 2000, the time should have been reduced to six
months, the traditional waiting time.
</P>
<P>
   The reduction in the backlog is important for immigration
officials because citizenship is the one element that guarantees
that immigrants are fully integrated. To become an American
citizen, one has to be able to read and write some English and must
swear allegiance to the country. New citizens can vote; studies
have shown that many tend to vote for politicians who help them
achieve their dream of citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Attaining citizenship is crucial for the immigrants because it
allows them to travel with a U.S. passport and to petition
relatives from their home countries faster and have them arrive
sooner than those of noncitizens. It also entitles immigrants to
receive full federal benefits and, sometimes, it helps them obtain
better paying jobs more easily than noncitizens.
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   The citizenship backlog began two years ago after Congress
passed tough immigration laws and an unprecedented number of
people, fearing the loss of federal benefits and equal treatment
under the law, applied for citizenship. The agency, understaffed
and grappling with old technology while trying to comply with the
ever-increasing requests of Congress for quality control, could not
meet the demand. Files piled up, sometimes in boxes lined up in
hallways, and immigrants, from Los Angeles to Miami to Chicago to
New York, hunkered down for the long wait.
</P>
<P>
   Salomon Elias Garay, a 44-year-old immigrant from El Salvador,
applied for citizenship in 1996. In October of that year, he was
called for an interview and told to wait for his appointment to be
sworn in as a citizen. Garay, a delivery truck driver in Alameda
County, just south of San Francisco, said he was still waiting. He
is eager to become a citizen, he said, because, as a refugee of his
country's civil war, he cannot wait to cast his first vote in a
free election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I do when I go home is check the mail, waiting
for that envelope,'' Garay said. ``I've been doing it for 27 months
and it's just incredibly frustrating not to hear anything for so
long.''
</P>
<P>
   The backlog, which reached 1.9 million last September, is now at
1.8 million, just as it was in January 1998, when the INS
commissioner, Doris Meissner, announced that the $95 fee that
immigrants must send with their citizenship application packet
would have to be increased to $225 to help meet the agency's actual
cost of processing the cases.
</P>
<P>
   The day she made the announcement, though, Ms. Meissner pledged
that the fees would not be raised until the agency improved its
record of customer service and reduced the backlog. Despite the
agency's failure to deliver on Ms. Meissner's pledge, the fee was
raised last week.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nydia M. Velazquez, D-N.Y., said the increase was
``immoral.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you raise the fee when you haven't been able to
expedite the process for people?'' Ms. Velazquez said. ``My office
is like an ER. Old people, people with children, disabled, poor,
all wanting to know what is going on with their citizenship
applications.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Glickman, executive vice president of the Hebrew
Immigrant Aid Society, said the fee increase could not possibly be
justified.
</P>
<P>
   ``You expect services to be delivered in return,'' Glickman
said. ``Anyone who has ever stood in line at the motor vehicle
registration department can just imagine what it must be like for a
newly arrived, poor person to wait in line forever and not know if
or when your number will be called.''
</P>
<P>
   But William R. Yates, acting head of the agency's naturalization
program in Washington, said that the raise was justified because,
although the number of people waiting to naturalize had remained
steady, the agency's productivity had increased, reducing the delay
to 23 months now, from as many as 39 months last January. While the
agency was completing 40,000 citizenship cases a month last year,
it is now processing nearly 80,000 cases a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``An awful lot of thought, concern and discussion went into
it,'' Yates said, referring to the raising of the fee, a touchy
subject among immigrants who sometimes must use all their savings
to pay for the fees. If a family of five was to apply for
naturalization now, they would have to come up with $1,125. Before
Jan. 15, the cost would have been $475.
</P>
<P>
   The backlog remains high, Yates said, because people continue to
apply at a rate of 700,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's inability to chip away at the backlog has
frustrated immigrants and their advocates, who remain skeptical of
new initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try my best to understand the immigration service's point of
view,'' said Dolly Z. Hassan, supervising attorney for the Liberty
Center for Immigrants in Richmond Hills, N.Y. ``They have had
problems with computers; they are short of employees; their
software is inadequate; they lost the fingerprints. I've heard it
all. At this point, I've simply lost faith in the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hassan whips out her logbook to demonstrate her point: of
the 199 immigrants who filed applications for citizenship through
her agency in September 1996, 30 have not been called for
interviews. In her logbook, there are even immigrants who have been
waiting since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is Dhanrajie Gaffoor, who applied for citizenship in
November of 1995. In June of 1996, Ms. Gaffoor was called for an
interview and was told to wait for her oath ceremony, where the
actual citizenship is granted. Since then, Ms. Gaffoor, 28, has not
been able to find out what happened to her file, despite numerous
requests in writing and visits to the New York district office in
lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gaffoor, who lives in South Ozone Park, N.Y., but wants to
move to Boston with her family, said she does not dare to move for
fear that her case will be delayed even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so frustrated I don't know what else to do,'' Ms. Gaffoor
said. ``My daughter wasn't even born when I applied and now she is
3. How much longer can it take?''

U.S. BID TO ALTER MISSILE TREATY MET WITH SILENCE IN RUSSIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also MISSILE-U.S.) 
(mk) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russian leaders responded with silence Thursday to a
White House proposal to overhaul the 1972 Antiballistic Missile
Treaty to permit the construction of defenses against terrorist
missile attacks.
</P>
<P>
   That was no surprise. Russian strategists have long been deeply
opposed to altering the treaty. To some here, the surprise was that
the White House made the offer at all, as it is sure to anger
legislators pondering the fate of a far weightier accord, known as
Start 2, to reduce both nations' stocks of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   After years of delay, the Communists who control Russia's lower
house of Parliament had been ready to vote on Start 2 last month.
But they canceled the vote to protest the United States' bombing of
Iraq, an action seen here as a damning example of American
muscle-flexing and _ just as important _ disregard for Russian
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the new proposal, coupled with Defense Secretary
William Cohen's suggestion that the United States could abrogate
the treaty if Russia rejects changes, will be seen here as another
example of American dominance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. already wants to change the backbone of the
international system _ decision-making by the United Nations _ and
now wants to change some of the treaties as well,'' said Sergei
Karamanov, an arms-control expert and director of the Institute of
Europe, a Moscow research organization. ``It's unfortunate that it
comes during this political situation where relations are not their
best. Russia is in a situation now where even virtual threats are
considered real.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the Russian government had almost nothing to say
about the proposal, which was outlined in a letter from President
Clinton to President Boris Yeltsin. The text has not been released.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is being studied and the position is being
coordinated with corresponding agencies,'' a Foreign Ministry
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Russian military made its opposition clear four days
earlier, after Secretary of State Madeleine Albright floated the
notion of altering the missile treaty in an interview with The Los
Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, too, said the United States was preparing for the day
when countries like North Korea or Iran may threaten U.S. cities.
But Leonid Ivashov, a Defense Ministry official overseeing
international affairs, responded, ``Any military expert understands
that these countries do not have and will hardly acquire guaranteed
means of reaching U.S. territory,'' the Interfax news service
reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``Therefore,'' Ivashov added, ``the Russian Defense Ministry
sees U.S. statements about the cancellation of the ABM Treaty or a
revision of its clauses as being aimed against Russia's security
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia regards the treaty, which all but bans defenses against
ballistic missiles, as central to its nuclear deterrent. The
agreement has gained importance as each arms-control accord reduced
Russia's nuclear arsenal, further raising the distant prospect that
a U.S. system may one day be able to knock Russia's entire missile
fleet out of the skies.
</P>
<P>
   Russian military experts are especially suspicious of proposals
for space-based defenses like the Reagan administration's ``Star
Wars'' program, partly on the ground that the missiles could evolve
into offensive weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators here are so adamant on the issue that some have
already said any approval of Start 2 would be conditioned on
keeping the missile agreement intact.
</P>
<P>
   Russian military officials support ratification of Start 2,
reasoning that the nation's financial difficulties will force a
reduction in nuclear weapons anyway, and that the agreement would
bind the United States to cutbacks as well.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Start 2 has languished in the lower house since it was
signed in 1993, in part because Communists have argued that the
United States would take advantage of nuclear cutbacks to end the
missile treaty and build a missile system.
</P>
<P>
   Spurgeon Keeny Jr., director of the Arms Control Association in
Washington, predicted Thursday that the new U.S. proposal would
almost inevitably bring those fears back to the fore. From the
Russian viewpoint, he said in a telephone interview, ``it's at a
minimum treating them with contempt, and at a maximum has some
sinister purpose.''

CLINTON LAWYERS SEEN AS HAVING SCORED POINTS IN SENATE

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the White House rested its case in President
Clinton's trial Thursday, Senate Republicans and Democrats agreed
that Clinton's lawyers mounted a strong defense, but they remained
divided over whether they needed to hear more evidence before
voting on the impeachment articles.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats insisted that the White House's legal assault had
punched big holes in the House prosecutors' case, and they
continued to press Republicans to skip a scheduled vote early next
week to depose witnesses and vote instead on acquittal or
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know the votes aren't there, so why drag it out?'' said
Sen. John Breaux, D-La.
</P>
<P>
   But many Senate Republicans, who support calling witnesses to
clear up conflicting testimony, urged their colleagues to withhold
judgment on witnesses at least until the next phase of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning on Friday, Democrats and Republicans will divide up to
16 hours to question the opposing counsels for the first time. Each
side has been collecting and organizing questions, which will be
read by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The White House has good lawyers and they scored some
points,'' said Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., whose brother, Asa, is
one of the House prosecutors. ``Now everyone is looking forward to
the question-and-answer time, when it'll give the House an
opportunity to do some rebuttal.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the lead prosecutor, complained
Thursday that the managers had had no time to rebut the White
House's defense. Hyde said the prosecutors had not decided on a
final list of witnesses, although he has called for bringing in
Monica Lewinsky, Betty Currie and Vernon Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   With opening statements from both sides now complete, the
situation remains remarkably fluid. Democrats and Republicans are
talking among themselves about whether to dismiss the case and
which, if any, witnesses are needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of flux and a lot of movement and a lot of talk
and groping toward a bipartisan solution,'' said Sen. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y. ``Things haven't firmed up yet, and there is too
much swirling about.''

FLIGHT PUT OFF FOR PROTOTYPE DESIGNED TO REPLACE SHUTTLE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A fuel tank production problem has pushed back plans
for the first flight of the prototype for a radical new reusable
rocket that could replace the space shuttle, experts said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Liftoff for the X-33 prototype has been delayed until mid-2000.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the California-based Lockheed Martin Skunk Works,
which is directing the $1.2 billion project for NASA, estimate
their prototype for the wedge-shaped rocket will begin a series of
up to 15 suborbital test flights as much seven months behind
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-1996, the Clinton administration initiated efforts to
develop a less-expensive-to-operate, single-stage rocket that could
replace the space shuttle in 2012. The White House plans a decision
by the end of 2000 on whether to sponsor development of a larger
operational version of the X-33 called the VentureStar or allow
NASA to make major modifications to the 18-year-old shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   The X-33 is considered a technically high-risk venture by
several aerospace experts because of its reliance on exotic new
lightweight materials and a novel propulsion system. One recent
government-funded study, has urged NASA to proceed cautiously with
major shuttle upgrades as an alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Another assessment suggests NASA will have to rely on both
spacecraft during a gradual transition.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 23, efforts to assemble the X-33's single 67-foot-long
test rocket were stalled when factory inspections revealed the
composite liner of one of two multi-lobed hydrogen fuel tanks had
not bonded properly, said Lockheed Martin Vice President Jerry
Rising.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty was limited to a liner on one of four lobes on
the irregular shaped fuel tank. The second tank was successfully
fabricated and a new lining for the damaged lobe should be
manufactured by the end of March, Rising said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin suggested on Thursday that the number of tests
could be cut to make up for the time lost to the fuel tank problem.
</P>
<P>
   Developers plan to launch the unmanned X-33 from Edwards Air
Force Base, Calif. After it reaches space, they would guide it to
aircraft-style landings at the Dugway Proving Ground in Utah and
the Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. One of the key goals of
the testing effort is that Lockheed Martin conduct three launches
in three weeks and achieve one two-day turnaround between flights.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Payton, who directs NASA's space transportation technology
development effort, said the agency remains confident in Lockheed
Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the most demanding space launch technology program that
the government has undertaken in decades,'' said Payton. ``This
vehicle represents the most advanced technology in every subsystem.
There is very little that is not new. We have assembled the top
talent both in government and within industry to pull off this
program.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; While slowed by problems with the fuel tank, the program has
made major strides in the development of the X-33's nozzleless
propulsion system and the outer metal thermal protection system.
</P>
<P>
   NASA is planning to invest more than $900 million in the X-33.
It hopes that in return, Lockheed Martin can incorporate the
technical breakthrough in a pair of corporately financed reusable
VentureStar rockets that could operate commercially with NASA among
paying customers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the National Research Council urged the
space agency to focus its investments in shuttle upgrades on those
modifications that improve safety and eliminate obsolescent
components. It recommended that NASA hold off on a $5 billion
effort to replace the shuttle's solid rocket boosters with a
liquid-fueled replacement until a decision is reached on whether
the shuttle should be replaced. The replacement's designed to make
an automated runway landing for reuse after each launch.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, another study by Hawthorne, Krauss &AMP; Associates
of Boston forecast significant savings to NASA if it embraced a
shuttle replacement. But the consultants noted that its success
will depend on the willingness of a private investor like Lockheed
Martin to bear significant financial risk. It predicted a gradual
transition will be necessary.

SENATORS' QUESTIONS EXPECTED TO FOLLOW PARTY LINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After sitting for six days in unaccustomed silence,
senators at President Clinton's impeachment trial Friday will begin
asking questions that are expected to focus on constitutional
issues and possibly crucial contradictions that could determine the
case's outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic aides said they expect many party members to
highlight inconsistencies raised this week by the White House
defense lawyers, asking the House managers whether telephone logs
dispel the argument that presidential secretary Betty Currie
initiated the retrieval of Clinton's gifts to former intern Monica
S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans, meanwhile, are expected to try to turn the
questions about the discrepancies against the Democrats, saying
such queries prove there is a need to call witnesses, which many
Democrats oppose.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, who said he and Senate
Minority Leader Thomas Daschle will try to prevent repetitious
questions from being asked, made clear Thursday he hopes senators
won't ask about the details of Clinton's sexual relationship with
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want any inappropriate questions about salacious
matters,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional aides said they don't expect the questions to
elicit any surprise answers from the House managers or White House
defense lawyers. Instead, revelations could come from the
questions, as some senators might tip their hand about whether they
would vote for or against conviction.
</P>
<P>
   For example, congressional aides said they will watch closely to
see if Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, a Democrat and
stickler for the Constitution, asks a question that shows he has
doubts about the president's defense. Similarly, Republican
moderates such as Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine
and Senator James Jeffords of Vermont will be watched in case their
questions reveal reservations about the prosecution's case.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffords, according to an aide, would like to ask a series of
questions about the timeline of events, such as conflicts in
testimony about key phone calls by presidential aides. That might
indicate that Jeffords still has doubts about the prosecution's
case, and the answers he receives could determine how he votes.
</P>
<P>
   John Cwartacki, an aide to Lott, said he doesn't expect the
questions to prompt a ``Perry Mason moment'' where a senator's
question suddenly turns the case around. He said the House managers
and the White House lawyers are too good to be thrown off balance
in such a manner.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the arrangement for questioning agreed to Thursday
might prohibit the kind of lively courtroom exchange that viewers
may be expecting.
</P>
<P>
   The questions, arranged on index cards, will be handed in order
to the presiding officer, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, who
will then read each query and identify the senator who posed it,
according to Cwartacki.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of both parties have spent the past week collecting
possible questions, culling out the many repetitions, and
organizing them in a logical sequence. There is no specific plan
for follow-up questions, but the leadership of each party could
determine whether the question has been answered and whether
another on the same topic should be allowed.
</P>
<P>
   A maximum of 16 hours for the question-and-answer period is
allowed, five hours Friday and as much time as needed Saturday. The
questions will be rotated between Republicans and Democrats. The
House managers and White House lawyers have the right to object to
any question, with Rehnquist ruling on the objection. But Rehnquist
can be overruled by a majority vote of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The questioners are expected to fall into two categories: the
party liners and the freelancers.
</P>
<P>
   The party liners, both Democrats and Republicans, are expected
to ask questions that, respectively, back up the president's case
or cut it down.
</P>
<P>
   The freelancers, meanwhile, are those senators who may ask
unpredictable questions that undermine the view of their party
leadership. The freelancers might stray from the view of their
party leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is probably a bunch on our side of the aisle and their
side and we know where they stand,'' said one key Democratic aide,
who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``But there is a small group
in the middle where no one knows what they are going to do. Their
questions will give you some insight into what their thinking is
and concerns are.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic aides said they expect many senators in their party
to ask questions that focus on what they perceive as
inconsistencies in the House manager's case.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Democratic aide said, the House managers stated
that Currie initiated the idea of picking up gifts that Lewinsky
had received from Clinton. The implication was that Currie was
instructed to do so by the president. But Democrats, following the
statements of the White House lawyers, are expected to note that
Currie picked up the gifts at 2 p.m., 92 minutes before she called
Lewinsky on a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Democrats are expected to ask House managers to
answer questions posed earlier this week by White House counsel
Charles F. C. Ruff. For example, Ruff disputed the assertion by the
House managers that presidential friend Vernon E. Jordan Jr.
initiated a job search for Lewinsky because a federal judge allowed
lawyers in the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit to ask questions
that might involve Lewinsky. Ruff said while Lewinsky and Jordan
met on Dec. 11, 1997, their talk ended at 1:45 p.m., while the
judge's ruling was made at 6:33 p.m., when Jordan was on a plane to
Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans hope these questions about inconsistencies wind
up working in favor of their effort to call witnesses, who would be
asked to clear up the questions. A vote on whether to call
witnesses could take place Monday or Tuesday, GOP aides said.
Republicans, with 55 seats in the Senate, need 51 votes to call
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Senators are also expected to ask a series of constitutional
questions. Clinton is accused of two crimes, perjury and
obstruction of justice, that are not specifically mentioned in the
Constitution regarding impeachment. Instead, the Constitution says
that a president can be impeached for bribery, treason and other
high crimes and misdemeanors. Senator Joseph Lieberman, the
Connecticut Democrat, has said he might vote against conviction
even if he is convinced that Clinton committed perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said through a spokeswoman that he wants to ask the
House managers about ``what constitutes a high crime and
misdemeanor'' and whether there are limits to violations of law
that would require removal from office. For example, the
spokeswoman said the senator will ask whether ``driving under the
influence constitutes a high crime or misdemeanor.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans are expected to ask the White House lawyers to
read the criminal code, which provides similar penalties for
perjury and bribery, showing that the two crimes are considered
equal and fall into the category of ``other high crimes and
misdemeanors.''

COACHES, PLAYERS GET IN STEP 
</HEADLINE>

 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NBA players and coaches got to bond Thursday for the first time
since labor peace was declared 15 days ago. The league office,
already on circuit overload after 13 days of fine-tuning the new
400-page Collective Bargaining Agreement, was faced with the
thankless task of rubber-stamping all the deals, which held up
practice time for the Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   As the day wore on, the league released its much-anticipated
50-game schedule, undoubtedly prompting howls from Miami to
Vancouver. The Celtics play 15 of their first 22 on the road, but
also have an entire free week after opening with four games in five
days. Among their rivals, the Knicks, Heat, and Magic make only one
Boston appearance apiece, while the Pacers are in twice. So, too,
is Chicago, which might have meant something at one time. Three
teams from the West come through, the best being the Timberwolves,
although the reloaded Nuggets _ with Antonio McDyess, Nick Van
Exel, and Chauncey Billups _ are in as well. Chris Ford will be
back with his Clippers on St. Patrick's Day.
</P>
<P>
   There also was an unbelievable amount of player activity
Thursday, unprecedented in league history. All the agreed-to deals
from last week were at last approved by the league and publicly
announced. Scottie Pippen is now a Rocket, and was joined by hacker
Charles Barkley, who signed on for one more year in Houston. The
Suns renounced 10 players, saving only Rex Chapman and Cliff
Robinson, to make their anticipated run at Tom Gugliotta. There
were reports late in the day that he was leaning toward Phoenix,
which also acquired Luc Longley in a deal with the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta also was mulling an $85-plus million offer from the
Timberwolves, who expected an answer no later than Friday; they do
not plan to sign Gugliotta and trade him to the Lakers, which had
been one rumor.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolves did have a Plan B, however, and that might be the
signing of free agent Joe Smith, once a surefire superstar who
turned down a $10 million-per-year deal with the Warriors. He'll
probably end up in the ``middle class'' exception slot starting at
$1.75 million. The Wolves also have been fielding calls from the
agent of free agent Corliss Williamson, whom the Kings were
thinking of renouncing to make more room to sign Vlade Divac, who
turns 31 in 12 days. The Kings could have signed Michael Stewart,
who's 23, but didn't want to dent the stash for Divac. Stewart
spurned the Celtics, signing a one-year deal with Toronto,
undoubtedly with the (wink, wink) understanding that he would
re-sign next year for more dough when the Raptors had cap room.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics opened camp at 2 p.m., the hour that signings,
trades, and other personnel moves could be officially consummated.
Rick Pitino, however, found himself without four bodies for the
first session, as deals for Tony Battie, Popeye Jones, and free
agents Dwayne Schintzius and Marlon Garnett had not been approved
by then. All was expected to be fine for the night session.
</P>
<P>
   One of the many once-a-year twists in the new agreement is that
there is no trading deadline. Teams will be able to move players
right up until the end of the season, at which time they will, if
lucky enough, submit a playoff roster. That could lead to an
interesting final two weeks for teams that feel they need that
extra special someone. Teams also will have the rest of the season
to re-sign their two-year players to long-term extensions. The
Celtics took care of that already with Antoine Walker, but other
teams and players (Ray Allen with Milwaukee, for example) will have
some time to get it done.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, for the next group of rookies, which includes
Boston's Ron Mercer, the period will start once the team is
eliminated from playoff competition.
</P>
<P>
   The 400-page agreement is almost twice as long as the previous
one, which helps explains why it took so long to get it signed.
League consigliore Jeff Mishkin said there were ``dozens and
dozens'' of real disputes, one of the biggest coming on length of
contracts for players signed out of the middle-class exception. The
players had said it was six, the league insisted there had been no
such agreement and fought for three. The union prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   The added length is due mainly to a 50-page drug agreement and
sections on the escrow arrangement and management in Years 4-6 of
the deal. Under the terms of the drug deal, all players will be
randomly tested during training camp and rookies three more times
during the season. For the first time, marijuana and unspecified
performance-enhancing drugs are included, but penalties for their
misuse are not as severe as those for using cocaine, heroin, or
Ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   There also is a new ``behavior'` clause prompted by the Latrell
Sprewell episode from early last season. Any player who engages in
``significant and inexcusable'' physical attack on team personnel
or anyone in an arena can have his contract terminated.
</P>
<P>
   The league also insisted on stronger language for deals it feels
clearly circumvent the salary cap. Teams and agents can be subject
to fines if determined to have acted in a suspicious manner,
something that has been commonplace (e.g. Chris Dudley, Danny
Manning) in the past.

LOTTERY MAY SELECT 3 COMPANIES TO RUN WEB DOMAIN-NAME REGISTRATION 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)   By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nonprofit board charged with opening the Internet's
lucrative domain-name registration business to competition is
leaning toward an international lottery to pick the five companies
that will get the first shot at ending the government-sanctioned
monopoly held by Network Solutions Inc., the board's chairman said.
</P>
<P>
   Esther Dyson, interim chairman of the Internet Corporation for
Assigned Names and Numbers, said this week that she expected the
selection process to be complete and that the registry for the
three most popular top-level domains _ .com, .net and .org _ would
be open to competition by the end of April.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, Network Solutions, based in Herndon, Va., has had
the exclusive worldwide right to assign Internet addresses that end
in any of those three-letter suffixes. To date, it has assigned
some 3 million addresses, charging $70 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   This monopoly has allowed it to realize phenomenal growth. Its
net income the first nine months of 1998 grew threefold, to $7.5
million, or 45 cents a share, compared with $2.5 million, or 20
cents a share, for the first nine months of 1997. On Jan. 5, it
announced plans for both a stock split and a secondary offering of
4.58 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dyson said that the board, which was taking over the
day-to-day administration of the Internet numbering and addressing
system from the government, was assembling a panel of 10 experts to
work with Network Solutions on the technical aspects of opening its
registry to competitors. The board will also draft criteria for
companies that wish to compete in the system, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If more than five apply, which is very likely, we need a way
to pick five. We will probably hold a lottery,'' she said, adding
that special provisions would have to be made to insure geographic
diversity ``so that they're not all from North America or not all
from Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   The initial ``threshold'' for applicants will be quite high, Ms.
Dyson said, ``to make sure they are credible players, since in the
long run the market will take care of people who are not
credible.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, scores of companies around the world are expected to
enter the domain-registration business. But the board must decide a
number of key issues before full-scale competition begins, among
them how to structure three supporting organizations, including the
crucial central group that will make recommendations on domain name
and registration policies.
</P>
<P>
   But Network Solutions has not been sitting around waiting for
the end. Just before Christmas, its stock prices tripled to an
all-time high of $172.25 after it announced important alliances
with the Netscape Communications Corp. and Yahoo. With a government
guarantee that it will still be a registrar once competition is
introduced, it has been aggressively building its own international
network of partners to handle registrations around the world for
Network Solutions. As of Thursday, the company said it had signed
partnership agreements with 85 companies worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the Information Technology Association of America is
sponsoring a meeting in Washington to encourage a compromise on
draft bylaws for the supporting group that will recommend how to
further open competition in the registration business and when and
how many new top-level domains should be added to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A number of draft bylaws have been proposed, with various groups
arguing over whether trademark holders and big corporations would
have too much control and how this new Internet government would be
financed.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of competition in the registration system will
mark the first noticeable difference for consumers in the
years-long process by which the government is handing control of
the Internet to the private sector. Ms. Dyson's board remains under
the oversight of the Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's decision nearly two years ago to
get out of the Internet business was spurred in part by complaints
from around the world that Network Solutions had an unfair monopoly
on the domain-registration business.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the company reported record numbers of registrations
and record profits. Analysts said this week that they expected
revenues to hit $90 million for 1998, compared with revenues of $6
million, $18 million and $45 million, respectively, the previous
three years.
</P>
<P>
   Network Solutions' shares closed Thursday at $169.25, down $6.25
on a day that saw big hits across the board in technology stocks
and a drop of almost 3 percent in the Nasdaq composite index.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Network Solutions registered about 1.9 million new
domain names, nearly double its 1997 total of 960,000 names. Its
hold on the lucrative registration business has made it one of the
high-flying Internet stocks on Wall Street in recent months,
despite the imminent loss of its lucrative monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Once new registrars are introduced, the company will be
obligated to transfer registrations of addresses ending in .com,
.net and .org to its competitors if customers decide they would
rather deal with one of the new companies.
</P>
<P>
   But many analysts anticipate that the company will maintain its
dominance, in part because the process for moving Internet
governance to the private sector and opening the registration
business has taken so long, giving the company much-needed time to
diversify and solidify its leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration initially expected to move
administration of the Internet to the private sector much more
quickly. But after seeking public comment in July 1997 on the best
way to do that, it discovered that the issue was highly
contentious, as corporations, individuals and governments around
the world jockeyed for a say in who would control the new nonprofit
group. &QL;

COAST GUARD FINDS $186 MILLION OF COCAINE ON FREIGH T ER EN ROUTE
TO TEXAS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Panama)  By RICK LYMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Footprints in a mountain of iron ore caught the eye of
Coast Guard officers searching a 580-foot Panamanian freighter
intercepted in the Caribbean Sea about 125 miles southwest of
Jamaica while on her way to Texas from Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ``The footprints made the boarding party suspicious, so
ultimately they went in and probed and found the cocaine,'' Raymond
W. Kelly, commissioner of the Customs Service, said Thursday. ``It
was sealed in bales, almost five tons of it, 9,500 pounds, enough
to fill a room.''
</P>
<P>
   The Drug Enforcement Administration said the cocaine was worth
$186 million.
</P>
<P>
   The joint operation by the Coast Guard, the Customs Service and
the drug enforcement agency was announced by federal officials at
the Greens Port Terminal on the Houston Ship Channel, where the
freighter is being held. It is the largest such seizure of cocaine
coming into a Texas port, and the ``fourth or fifth largest that
we've ever had,'' Kelly said. ``It's a lot of cocaine.''
</P>
<P>
   The largest cocaine seizure on a ship was 12 tons off Panama in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said the latest cocaine seizure involved the
freighter Cannes, owned by a Greek consortium and operating under
Panamanian registry. She was intercepted on Jan. 13 by a Coast
Guard law-enforcement team aboard a Navy ship, the Whirlwind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a normal practice,'' said Kelly, who declined to say
whether federal officials had any particular reason to target the
Cannes.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard officers asked the captain for permission to board
the vessel, received permission and began their search. The first
team found nothing, but a second team from the Coast Guard cutter
Venturous made the discovery beneath the cargo of 26,000 metric
tons of iron ore on its way to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials contacted the Panamanian government and
received permission to bring the vessel into Houston under the
jurisdiction of U.S. drug and smuggling laws. For six days the
Coast Guard escorted the Cannes north through the Caribbean, into
the Gulf of Mexico and, on Tuesday night, into the Houston Ship
Channel, where the cocaine was seized.
</P>
<P>
   Announcement of the seizure was delayed until Thursday morning,
when it was made by a coterie of high-level federal officials
including Kelly; Rodney Slater, the secretary of transportation,
and Adm. James M. Loy, the commandant of the Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   The ore had been loaded in Brazil on Dec. 20, and federal
officials said the Cannes made her most recent port of call in
Trinidad on Jan. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Five members of the ship's 24-member crew were arrested,
including the captain. All are foreign citizens, most of them from
Ukraine, although some are Greek, Panamanian and Nicaraguan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a lot to learn about this smuggling attempt,''
Kelly. ``There are more co-conspirators besides those on the
vessel. In the coming months we will identify them, build our case
and bring them to justice.''

WEIRD SCHEDULE FOR CELTICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ How do you explain this? Despite the most concentrated,
compacted schedule in NBA history, the Celtics have an entire week
off in February. That's one of the many interesting twists in
Boston's 50-game schedule for what will be the 1998-99 NBA season.
</P>
<P>
   The week hiatus is one of few perks, and it was highlighted by
coach Rick Pitino when the schedule was released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will give us a lot of practice time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage is the caliber of competition from the Western
Conference. Of the six teams they play, only two (Minnesota and
Portland) made the playoffs last year. The other four are
Sacramento, Vancouver, Denver, and the LA Clippers. The Celtics
also will play three games in three days for the first time since
Larry Bird's rookie season, 1979-80, and will do so on two
occasions, both in April.
</P>
<P>
   Now for the grim stuff. After opening at home against Toronto
(Feb. 5) and Cleveland (Feb. 6), the Celtics will play 15 of their
next 20 on the road. Included is a stretch of six straight roadies,
featuring a Western swing at Sacramento, Vancouver, and Portland.
There's also a brutal stretch in which the Celtics play five times
in eight days, all on the road: Toronto, Charlotte, Atlanta,
Detroit, Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the Pacers, the Celtics play Bird's boys three
times, twice in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Among Atlantic Division rivals, the Celtics play four games
against the Wizards and three against each of the other five teams.
The Knicks make only one FleetCenter appearance (Feb. 26), as do
the Heat (April 16) and the Magic (Feb. 24).
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics play 25 games against the eight Central Division
teams, with four coming against the Cavaliers and three against
everyone else. Toni Kukoc and the Chicago Bulls make two visits to
Boston, as do Grant Hill and the Pistons.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's two stints of three games in three days come April 7-9,
with homers against Washington and Philly sandwiched around a trip
to Toronto, and from April 21-23, starting with a home game against
the 76ers and then following with roadies in Atlanta and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The regular season ends May 5 with the only appearance of the
Charlotte Hornets. The playoffs are scheduled to begin May 8.

BUMPERS' ORATION IN DEFENSE OF CLINTON WINS BIPARTISAN SALUTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For all his country lawyer's eloquence, the triumph
in Dale Bumpers' extraordinary return to the Senate on Thursday was
most evident after he finished addressing the chamber he loves so
well.
</P>
<P>
   For it was then that a remarkably bipartisan crowd of senators _
of the very judges and jurors of the impeached President Clinton _
hurried to his side in the well of the chamber to shake his hand,
to hug him, to congratulate him for a defense lawyer's job well
done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very impressive!'' Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., loudly cackled
from the admiring throng to his friend, the retired, four-term
Democratic senator from Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go immediately to the people's agenda,'' Bumpers had
tantalizingly pleaded only minutes before in urging the Senate to
acquit Clinton and instantly return to the legislative business he
knows they crave far more than the sordid impeachment agenda before
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do your solemn duty,'' he further pleaded at the close of a
speech that had held the senators in a crackling state of
attentiveness as they sensed a pivotal moment in the impeachment
trial unfolding in the heartfelt entreaty of an old and
much-respected peer.
</P>
<P>
   Senators on both sides smiled in sizing up the visitor as
someone who finally was delivering a senatorial speech. Some
suddenly gestured in warning when Bumpers' lapel microphone fell
away. No problem for a fellow pro: Bumpers regained the mike and
resumed confidently striding before them, stressing how the people
are clamoring for more of the people's business, not the
president's scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're asking for an end to this nightmare,'' said Bumpers,
describing his old friend, Clinton, and the Clinton family as
``decimated'' by five straight years of investigations and by the
``terrible moral lapse of marital infidelity'' by the president
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people are saying please don't protect us from this man,''
he declared, daring the political instincts of a Senate gathering
he intimately understands.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton team seemed had in special need of a senatorial
stem-winder after the long lawyerly evidence explication of David
Kendall, the president's personal counsel. Senators had fidgeted at
the Dickensian detail that Kendall offered on such things as the
precise turnings of Monica Lewinsky's job search in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Bumpers then took the floor as something of a sight for sore
eyes. Old colleagues beamed as he artfully mixed laconic humor and
constitutional exegesis, easy as an old hand back at the tiller.
</P>
<P>
   Bumpers had added a few final margin touches to his speech while
Kendall was addressing the chamber. In Bumpers' delivery, the
Senate relished an orator quickly re-embracing his beloved hall of
discourse and strife.
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisan salute implicit in the senatorial crowd that
surrounded Bumpers occurred despite the fact that he did not
hesitate to turn rather scathingly on the House Republican
impeachment prosecutors immediately to his right. He charged that
their weakness of ``wanting to win too badly'' led them to distort
critical grand jury testimony to justify hollow perjury charges.
Mockingly, he lingered over the minutiae of a souvenir gift ceramic
bear from the president that prosecutors nevertheless chose to
invoke as a talisman of sinister plotting.
</P>
<P>
   So graceful, so at ease was Bumpers in his old debating haunts
that it was hard to imagine him intent on settling some oratorical
scores. But indeed he was, excoriating the House prosecutors for an
unrelenting lack of compassion in their treatment of the president.
</P>
<P>
   With bucolic tone but steely edge, Bumpers reminded Rep. Henry
Hyde, R-Ill., the lead impeachment prosecutor, who sat listening
nearby, that it was for individual war veterans, not politicians
embattled in impeachment, to decide whether patriotism itself cries
out for Clinton's banishment.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to Hyde to appropriate one of his favorite phrases,
``the rule of law,'' Bumpers again brought the people into the
trial equation. ``We've also learned that the rule of law involves
presidential elections,'' he declared dryly after reverentially
reviewing the work of the founding fathers in writing the
Constitution to protect the high office from partisan undermining.
</P>
<P>
   As he finished, senators seemed to want to hear more from
Bumpers, a respected Senate orator in his day who showed them the
speechmaker's gifts do not rust in political retirement. He drew
bipartisan kisses from women senators and tribal back slaps from
the men.
</P>
<P>
   As he came down the aisle amid the pre-trial hubbub, Bumpers
seemed momentarily at sea. Then he was pleasantly startled by a
hearty slap on the back from Sen. Robert Byrd, the Democratic dean.
More senators leaned to him in greeting.
</P>
<P>
   Bumpers reacted happily. He was back once more, re-entitled to
speak before them, to argue one more case, the direst warning he
could manage against his cherished Senate's casting Bill Clinton
from the presidency.

GOP ASSESSING IMPEACHMENT TRIAL DAMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The impeachment trial that was supposed to singe
the Democratic president is turning the Republican Party on itself.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when some GOP senators signaled unease with calling
witnesses and prolonging the trial, GOP leaders from around the
country huddled Thursday to assess the political damage in their
states from the unpopular impeachment of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Potomac River, conservative activists gathered at
another hotel and hailed the GOP as the party of principle and
morality, never mind the negative public opinion toward
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is never politically wrong, long term, to do the right
thing,'' said Gary Bauer, a social conservative with GOP
presidential ambitions. Bauer said Republicans on Capitol Hill
should ignore the polls, proceed with the trial, and also push a
strong legislative agenda. ``I think the Republican Party is
capable of walking and chewing gum at the same time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans aren't savoring the taste of impeachment in
quite the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impeachment is the castor oil of politics,'' said Chris
DePino, Connecticut's Republican Party chairman. ``The people don't
want it, and our party has to swallow it. I say we've done the
trial with respect and dignity. Now get it over as soon as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   DePino said the GOP's focus on impeachment has become ``a major
league concern'' for moderate Republicans in the Northeast who win
elections with the help of Democratic voters. Any newly elected
Republican governor will tell you, DePino said, that polls matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, right now we're being cast as the party of
Henry Hyde, who is an honest man, but he's not the Republican Party
of women, minorities, and young people that we need it to be,''
said DePino, who is attending the Republican National Committee's
winter meeting this week.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Rath, the GOP national committeeman from New Hampshire,
called the Senate trial ``a distraction that doesn't seem to have
any outcome other than what is foreknown _ there aren't 67 votes''
to convict the president. Calling witnesses, he said, would only
``drag out'' something that should end ``sooner rather than
later.''
</P>
<P>
   Rath said he believes his colleagues on the Republican National
Committee, who are looking ahead to presidential and state races in
2000, are worried and impatient.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an issue we can run on and win the White House
on,'' said Rath, who is a longtime adviser to former Tennessee
Governor Lamar Alexander, who ran for the presidential nomination
in 1996 and is expected to do so again in 2000. ``This just delays
the contest from getting going and casts us as a party with a
negative focus.''
</P>
<P>
   When Steve Forbes, another GOP presidential hopeful, spoke
Thursday to the Conservative Political Action Conference about
issues he said Republicans should embrace _ scrapping the tax code,
eliminating big-government programs, ending late-term abortions,
and rebuilding the military _ he did not mention removing Clinton
from office. Instead, Forbes said Clinton was ``a walking, talking
monument to the failure of the Republican establishment,''
including ``mushy moderates'' who led the party to defeats in 1992
and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Later, pressed by reporters on the president's impeachment
trial, Forbes said he would vote ``guilty'' if he were a senator,
and he praised GOP leaders who have risked political retribution
and withstood the public opinion ``whims of the moment'' to do
their constitutional duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is essential for Republicans to put up a full
trial, hear the witnesses, hear the evidence, and for senators to
then render a judgment,'' said Forbes, a millionaire businessman.
``The party must stand for real principle, real policies. Otherwise
it will end up the political equivalent of Jurassic Park.''
</P>
<P>
   As the president's defense team ended its presentation in the
Senate Thursday afternoon, there were signs of division among
Republican senators, as several came forward to suggest it might
not be necessary to call witnesses. Majority Leader Trent Lott said
he did not expect any senator would want to vote to ``dismiss the
case before they have had a chance to at least consider a subpoena
and see what witnesses would say in a deposition, where there are
conflicts.''
</P>
<P>
   To the surprise of some social conservatives, Pat Robertson, one
of their moral leaders and a former presidential candidate, on
Wednesday suggested that Clinton had won the public relations war
with his State of the Union address. ``They might as well dismiss
this impeachment hearing and get on with something else, because
it's over, as far as I'm concerned,'' Robertson said on the ``700
Club'' show.
</P>
<P>
   William Kristol, editor of the conservative Weekly Standard
magazine, said he doubted that opinion would sway conservatives
because up to now Robertson has not been an influential voice on
Clinton's impeachment. At the Christian Coalition convention in
September, Robertson urged that Clinton be removed from office
because he had been ``debauched, debased, and defamed'' by his
affair with Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't deny that Robertson's remarks give cover to
Republicans who don't want to push ahead with impeachment,''
Kristol said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with polls this week showing Clinton's approval rating
surging to more than 70 percent, a constant two-thirds of Americans
opposing his removal from office, and the popularity of Republican
leaders on the decline, some political analysts question why any
senators want to call witnesses in the Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mystery in our profession is why the House and the
senators choose to persevere in a no-win situation,'' said Jeffrey
Abramson, a professor of political and legal studies at Brandeis
University. ``What is driving this frenetic partisanship?''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Louis Sheldon, chairman of the Traditional Values
Coalition, a conservative group, says he believes history will be
the Republicans' witness. ``From Barry Goldwater's defeat in 1964,
GOP conservatism came to fruition,'' Sheldon said. ``From this
impeachment crisis will come moral, spiritual, and political
renewal for the party.''
</P>
<P>
   While the rout of Goldwater might not be her favorite model for
today, Patricia Harrison, co-chairman of the Republican National
Committee, said the party will survive the bad polls and internal
divisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not what we choose to do, but sometimes you have to do
what is right, even if it isn't right for you,'' Harrison said.
``Our wake-up call here is to get back on track as a party.''

FORD PRESSES EFFORTS TO BUY VOLVO 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Mich., Sweden, Italy)   By KEITH BRADSHER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. _ Ford Motor &UR;  &LR; Co. reported fourth-quarter
earnings Thursday that were stronger than expected, as the giant
auto maker also pressed ahead in its efforts to buy the car
business of Sweden's Volvo.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said that it earned $1.04 billion during the quarter, a
41.9 percent drop from a year earlier because Ford took $631
million in one-time, after-tax charges and because Ford spun off a
profitable consumer lending unit last spring.
</P>
<P>
   But Ford's earnings from continuing operations actually rose 6.5
percent during the fourth quarter from a year earlier. Excluding
the one-time charges, Ford earned $1.67 billion, or $1.35 a share,
exceeding financial analysts' average estimate of $1.27, according
to First Call Corp..
</P>
<P>
   Last quarter was the 11th consecutive of year-over-year
improvements in operating earnings, and those earnings increased
Ford's holdings of cash to $23.81 billion as of Dec. 31. This
corporate cash hoard is one reason why Ford has been cautiously
considering possible mergers and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Ford and Fiat &UR;  &LR; SpA of Italy have both made offers to buy Volvo's
car business, a person close to the talks said Thursday. Both bids
are well below the nearly $7 billion that Volvo believes the
business is worth, and Ford's bid is substantially lower than
Fiat's, the person said.
</P>
<P>
   But Volvo's top executives, the person said, would rather sell
the division to Ford, which is wealthy and far enough away that it
may leave almost entirely Swedish managers in charge. Ford is also
seen as an attractive buyer because it has poured billions of
dollars into turning around Jaguar after buying it a decade ago.
Jaguar posted record sales last year and is now profitable, John
Devine, Ford's chief financial officer, said.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Fiat has only $1.5 billion in cash, is trying to
stem an erosion in its European market share and is close enough to
Sweden that it might try to play a more direct role in running
Volvo, while reducing Volvo's costs.
</P>
<P>
   Cultural differences between Sweden and Italy may pose a further
obstacle to a deal between Fiat and Volvo, the person close to the
talks said. A planned Volvo merger with Renault was scuttled in
1993 when small Swedish shareholders and mid-level Swedish managers
at Volvo objected to what they described as a French takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Devine declined to comment on Ford's talks with Volvo. Fiat said
last week that it was in talks with Volvo and with one or two other
auto makers that it has not identified. Volvo and Fiat spokesmen
declined to comment. Part of Volvo's attraction for potential
buyers is that the Swedish auto maker is small enough that even an
unsuccessful merger would not seriously hurt its acquirer. But for
the same reason, some auto analysts view any acquisition of Volvo's
car business as an inconsequential distraction for a buyer, rather
than an opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Ford buys it, so what, and if Ford doesn't buy it, so
what?'' said Maryann Keller, an analyst at ING Baring in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo sold about 400,000 cars last year while Ford sold 6.8
million and Fiat sold 2.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's after-tax operating earnings for all of 1998 rose 7.9
percent, to $6.57 billion, with the bulk of its worldwide profits
coming from the sale of sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks to
American customers. Devine said the company's huge Super Duty
pickup truck had been sold out since its introduction last winter.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's total income last year officially was $22.07 billion, but
this included a $15.96 billion non-cash accounting gain resulting
from the spin-off last spring of its 80 percent stake in the
Associates First Capital, the consumer lending unit.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's sales last year fell to $144.42 billion from $153.63
billion in 1997, mainly because of the spin-off of Associates First
but also because of weak sales in Brazil and other emerging
markets. Ford revenues in the fourth quarter fell to $37.9 billion,
from $39.95 billion.
</P>
<P>
   A cost-cutting push that started in 1996 is also helping Ford's
profits at a time when slowing worldwide auto sales is forcing each
auto maker to generate more profits from each vehicle. ``The
reality of the auto business in the United States, Europe, Asia,
wherever you go, is you have to reduce your costs,'' Devine said at
a press conference this morning at Ford's headquarters here.
</P>
<P>
   Ford mentioned in October that it would be taking a series of
one-time charges, and provided details of them last week. The $631
million in after-tax charges are mostly for early retirement and
employee severance programs in Europe, but also reflect Ford's
writing down of certain investments in East Asia and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   In a weak stock market, Ford's stock fell $2.625 Thursday to
close at $62.0625, after jumping 75 cents on Wednesday, when GM
announced robust fourth-quarter earnings. Ford stock also produced
a total return to investors of 89 percent last year.

US MISSILE DEFENSE SPENDING TO BOOST RAYTHEON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon's renewed push to build an antimissile
defense system will likely give a financial boost to Raytheon Co.,
which has recently gained a major role in several of the weapons
programs that may be deployed.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon, maker of the Patriot defensive missile, has long been
a manufacturer of antimissile systems. With its 1997 purchase of
the defense units of Hughes Electronics Corp., Raytheon now has a
major role in nearly every important effort to develop the next
generations of antimissile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Defense Secretary William Cohen said the Clinton
administration would ask Congress for $6.6 billion in additional
funding for missile defense, bringing the total to $10.5 billion
through 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said the United States was forced to act because of the
growing threat from nations like North Korea, which are developing
new offensive missiles. But building an antimissile defense system
faces two major hurdles: The United States may have have to
renegotiate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Russia, and
US military contractors have failed so far to develop a reliable
way to destroy enemy missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has not said which of three antimissile systems now
under consideration will ultimately be deployed. But spending more
money on any of them will help Raytheon, which has a key role in
all three:
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a win-win-win situation for us,'' said Dave Shea,
spokesman for Raytheon Systems Co., the Lexington, Mass. company's
main weapons unit, based in Arlington, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said Raytheon chief executive Daniel Burnham ``is
exhuberant over the news. But it is too soon to assess how this
will translate to the bottom line. Certainly, we stand to gain.
Exactly how much remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said the Pentagon would continue to fund the three
proposed missile defense systems and hopes to choose which ones to
deploy in June 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing Co. is the lead company behind a program called National
Missile Defense, which seeks to defend the continental United
States against long-range missiles. Raytheon units in Tucson,
Ariz., acquired from Hughes, make the ``kill vehicle'' for the
system, which attempts to seek out and destroy an enemy missile.
Raytheon's factory in Waltham, Mass. makes radars for the system.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin Corp. is the lead contractor behind the Army's
Theater High-Altitude Area Defense program, a mobile system that
aims to defend a smaller area, or theater. THAAD has suffered
several test failures in recent months. Raytheon makes ground-based
radars for the system in Waltham.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon's Standard missile is a key component of the Navy
Theater Wide program, a ship-based system whose goal is similar to
that of THAAD. The Standard is made in Tennessee and Arizona.
Raytheon also makes the ``kill vehicle'' for the system in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy Wide Area program is several years behind THAAD in
development. But in a significant announcement Wedensday, Cohen
said the Pentagon would add more money to the Navy program and make
it a full competitor to THAAD in the race to develop a mobile
system to defend a limited area.
</P>
<P>
   While Raytheon has a key role in THAAD, it would likely gain
even more if the Pentagon ultimately decided to develop the Navy
system instead because it makes more of the components for that
weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon's reach into the antimissile business was also
illustrated in a related announcement by Cohen that the Pentagon
would try to ``restructure'' another antimissile program called
MEADS, or Medium Extended Air Defense System. That system is being
developed in cooperation with Germany and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon's shares closed at 53 5/8 down 2 15/16, on the New York
Stock Exchange.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a speech of rare eloquence, former Sen. Dale
Bumpers of Arkansas concluded the defense of President Clinton on
impeachment charges Thursday night, coupling an admission of
Clinton's sins and weaknesses with a plea for his acquittal for the
good of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people now and for some time have been asking to
be allowed a good night's sleep,'' the silver-haired Bumpers told
the 100 senators, who hung on his every word as they very rarely do
for anyone. ``They're asking for an end to this nightmare. It is a
legitimate request.''
</P>
<P>
   Recalling that James G. Blaine of Maine had concluded, 20 years
after voting to convict President Andrew Johnson in 1868, that he
had ``made a bad mistake,'' because conviction would have created
chaos, Bumpers cautioned: ``So it is with William Jefferson
Clinton. If you vote to convict, in my opinion, you're going to be
creating more havoc than he could ever possibly create. After all,
he's only got two years left.''
</P>
<P>
   His warning gained weight from his excoriation of the
president's conduct with Monica Lewinsky, the former White House
intern. Their illicit sexual affair underlies the two articles of
indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton may not have welcomed Bumpers' description of his
behavior as ``indefensible, outrageous, unforgivable, shameless,''
or his acknowledgment that perhaps the president deserved no
compassion. But that surely undercut any thought that he was
standing up for Clinton out of unquestioning friendship.
</P>
<P>
   Relaxed and discursive, strolling back and forth in the well of
the Senate, not standing stock-still behind a lectern as many
others have done, and eschewing legal fine points, Bumpers
introduced humor into the sober proceedings for the first time in
six tense days. Several of his self-deprecating sallies drew
guffaws. But he also spoke feelingly of the emotional devastation
Clinton has caused to his wife and daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons ``have been about as decimated as a family can
get,'' the former senator said, in one of the most explicit
comments any friend has made to date on the psychological toll of
the president's conduct. ``The relationship between husband and
wife, father and child, has been incredibly strained, if not
destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Bumpers' powerful presentation may or may not have changed many
Republican minds, and Republicans have a majority in the Senate.
But he surely stiffened the backs of any Democrats who may have
thought even fleetingly of deserting the president, and that is all
Clinton ultimately needs _ the votes of 45 Democrats, which would
make it arithmetically impossible for the Senate to muster the
two-thirds vote it needs to oust the president.
</P>
<P>
   A highly technical two-hour appearance by the president's
personal attorney, David Kendall, was reduced almost to the status
of a footnote by the Bumpers speech.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, Kendall rebutted five separate charges of
obstruction of justice contained in Article II. Many of them were
also covered in Article I, the perjury article, and so Kendall
plowed relatively little new legal ground. His strategy was to
contrast in every instance the sworn testimony of the principals _
Clinton, Ms. Lewinsky and Clinton's lawyer friend Vernon Jordan Jr.
_ with the ``mere suspicion and speculation'' on which he
disdainfully said the Republicans' circumstantial evidence rested.
</P>
<P>
   He accused the House managers who last week outlined the case
against Clinton of ``a concerted, partisan distortion'' of the
facts in the case.
</P>
<P>
   In a faint echo of the ill-concealed hostility to the special
prosecutor, Kenneth Starr, that dominated Clinton's defense in
months gone by, Kendall introduced himself with the archly
understated comment ``Since 1993, it has been my privilege to
represent the president in the tortuous and meandering Whitewater
investigation, which approximately a year ago was transformed in a
remarkable way into the Lewinsky investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Acid also crept into his tone when he described Linda Tripp, who
taped conversations with Ms. Lewinsky at the behest of Starr, as
``that paragon of faithful friendship,'' and when he repeatedly
referred to the House managers as ``able'' or ``very able'' while
denouncing their arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Part of his presentation dealt at length with Jordan's search
for a job in New York for Ms. Lewinsky, which the Republicans see
as an effort to buy her silence. When he insisted that all of the
executives whom Jordan called told investigators that they felt no
pressure to hire her even though Jordan is universally known as the
president's best buddy, several Republican senators had difficulty
in concealing their disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   Bumpers began by mocking himself. He said his audience on
Thursday was about the same size as all the audiences he had drawn
in his 24 years as a senator combined. His fourth term expired only
a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can take some comfort, colleagues, in the fact that I'm
not being paid,'' he said. ``And when I'm finished, you'll probably
think the White House got its money's worth.''
</P>
<P>
   He, too, spoke caustically of the length and scope of Starr's
``five-year, relentless, unending investigation,'' describing it as
``maybe the most intense investigation not only of a president but
of anybody, ever.'' Javier's pursuit of Jean Valjean in ``Les
Miserables'' ``pales by comparison,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the time, his rhetorical aim was much higher.
</P>
<P>
   Why, Bumpers asked, did Clinton, by his own admission deceive
his family, his friends, his Cabinet and the American public?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Bumpers said, answering his own question, ``he knew
this whole affair was about to bring unspeakable embarrassment and
humiliation upon himself, his wife, whom he adored, and a child
that he worshipped with every fiber in his body and for whom he
would happily have died to spare her this or to ameliorate her
shame and her grief.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are none of us perfect. Sure, you say, he should have
thought it all out beforehand, and indeed he should, just as Adam
and Eve should have.''
</P>
<P>
   Bumpers responded directly to those, including Rep. Henry Hyde
of Illinois, the chief prosecutor, who have suggested that the
United States is diminished as a force in the world by having ``a
presidential perjurer'' in office. In truth, he said, ``this nation
has never enjoyed greater prestige in the world than we do right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   In support, he cited comments made recently by President Carlos
Menem of Argentina, President Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic,
King Hussein of Jordan, and President Nelson Mandela of South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Like others on Clinton's defense team, he took the House
managers to task for having stretched evidence beyond the bounds of
common sense. But he softened his criticism with the comment ``It's
wanting to win too badly.''
</P>
<P>
   Bumpers, who spoke from notes scrawled on a yellow legal pad,
argued at some length that there was perjury and perjury, that some
lies told under oath were worse than others. There is ``a very big
difference,'' he said, between perjury about marital infidelity in
a divorce case and perjury in a murder case about buying the murder
weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``To charge somebody with the first, and punish them as though
it were the second, stands our sense of justice on its head,'' he
told the senators, many of whom are also lawyers. ``There is a
total lack of proportionality, a total lack of balance in this
thing. The charge and the punishment are totally out of sync.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Like others, Bumpers traced the deliberations in Philadelphia in
1787 that produced the Constitution and its impeachment article.
But he added two arguments applicable to the question of whether
impeachment deals with public actions exclusively or both public
and private actions. The Republicans say the latter, and even the
White House counsel, Charles Ruff, said on Tuesday that he could
conceive of impeachable private actions.
</P>
<P>
   Not Bumpers.
</P>
<P>
   First, he said that the phrase ``high crimes and misdemeanors,''
whose definition has been so hotly debated, had been found at the
last minute in the English law ``under a category which said
`distinctly political offenses against the state.''' Second, he
said that in the penultimate constitutional draft the words ``high
crimes and misdemeanors'' had been followed by the phrase ``against
the United States.'' That phrase was dropped from the final text
for stylistic reasons, he contended, ``because it was redundant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What are we doing here,'' Bumpers demanded of the senators.
</P>
<P>
   A former Marine, he urged that Hyde, who suggested that keeping
Clinton in office was an affront to those who fell on battlefields
from Bunker Hill to Saigon, talk to some of the Senate's own
``certified war heroes'' _ John Chafee of Rhode Island, who fought
at Guadalcanal, and Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, who lost an arm in
Italy, and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, who won a congressional Medal of
Honor in Vietnam. None, he implied, shared Hyde's view.
</P>
<P>
   He concluded by calling on his former colleagues not to set a
precedent they would regret.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't, for God's sake, heighten people's alienation that is at
an all-time high toward their government,'' Bumpers said. ``The
people have a right, and they are calling on you to rise above
partisanship. They're calling on you to do your solemn duty. And I
pray you will.''
</P>
<P>
   A question-and-answer period will start Friday and probably run
through Saturday. It is not to exceed 16 hours, and senators are
required to submit all questions in writing, to be put to the
prosecutors and defense lawyers by Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist, presiding.

 &HT;    Feud eliminates Elway as sentimental favorite
 &HT;    By Mark Bradley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This is a fight John Elway can't win. No matter how he
frames it, he can't make Dan Reeves seem the bad guy _ not this
season, not this Super Bowl. Elway was America's Choice last
January. His nemesis will be this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's league-wide sentiment for what Dan has accomplished,''
Jamal Anderson said. ``And when you put into play his heart...''
</P>
<P>
   Every Super Bowl has a plot. Some are manufactured. (Remember
Terry Bradshaw and Hollywood Henderson? Remember Jim McMahon and
the helicopter?) This year's is real. Reeves was fired by Denver
after the 1992 season. Elway took public delight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last three years have been hell,'' Elway said then. ``I
would not have been back here if Dan Reeves had been here. It
wasn't worth it to me. I didn't enjoy it. It wasn't any fun, and I
got tired of working with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, then with the New York Giants, offered this rejoinder:
``Just tell him it wasn't exactly heaven for me, either. One of
these days I hope he grows up.''
</P>
<P>
   This feud was so high-profile that Sports Illustrated splashed
it on its cover. (Seeing the five-year-old magazine, Reeves
laughed. ``I signed a bunch of those,'' he said.) On Wednesday, he
addressed his firing, his earlier dismissal of then-assistant Mike
Shanahan for insubordination/collaboration, the whole Elway Thing.
``There's still a lot of hurt,'' Reeves said. That will not,
guaranteed, be the last word. Beginning Sunday in Miami, there'll
be six consecutive days of press conferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``What am I going to do? I don't know that it's going to go
away,'' Reeves said Thursday. And then: ``I'd love to get away from
it.''
</P>
<P>
   If the churning of this story stands to favor anyone, it isn't
Elway. He and Shanahan lined up against Reeves, who was regarded in
Denver as a bloodless autocrat. That image has been well and truly
dashed. No one who saw Reeves weep in his post-bypass briefing or
attempt the Dirty Bird in the Metrodome will believe that this is a
man devoid of feelings. Indeed, Reeves is today what Elway was 53
weeks ago _ an honorable campaigner who needs a championship to cap
a distinguished career.
</P>
<P>
   Three times Reeves took Denver _ and Elway _ to the Super Bowl.
Three times the Broncos lost, each thrashing worse than the one
before. This record of big-game failure earned Elway a reservoir of
good will: ``He's taken his lumps, so now he deserves to win.'' But
Elway's lumps were nothing when viewed alongside Reeves'.
</P>
<P>
   Sacked in Denver and roasted by his former employees, not just
Elway; a loser in the struggle for control of the Giants; inheritor
of the league's most moribund franchise; in need of emergency
cardiac surgery during his season of seasons; conqueror of mighty
Minnesota in a certifiably classic game _ how can anyone root
against this man?
</P>
<P>
   ``John's got his (title),'' Reeves said. ``I ought to qualify
(as sentimental favorite). But Cornelius Bennett could very easily
be that guy. And I'm sure an awful lot of people will be pulling
for Denver to repeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Only those with hard hearts. Only those who don't know a great
story when it bites them in the backside. Only those ingrates who
want to see John Elway win twice.

 &HT;    White Shoes in Dirty Birds' closet
 &HT;    By Terence Moore
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Maybe you've seen it. If not, you'll see it often. In
fact, you'll be held captive by Dan Reeves' version of the Dirty
Bird for the rest of eternity on NFL Films and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Billy ``White Shoes'' Johnson laughed into the night
after the Atlanta Falcons coach punctuated his team's victory in
Minnesota last Sunday along the way to the Super Bowl by joining
his players on the sideline in the flapping of imaginary wings and
the shuffling of feet.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there is a bigger reason why Johnson still can't
stifle the giggles with that memory of Reeves. ``I ran into Dan
later, and we talked about the Dirty Bird,'' Johnson said, shaking
his head. ``He told me, 'Billy, I just can't do that thing without
music.'''
</P>
<P>
   So you've heard it here first. You'll hear it again and again
during the next few days. Well, that along with other Dirty Bird
stories from the Godfather of NFL Dancing.
</P>
<P>
   It's a given that Jamal Anderson will attract more than a few
cameras next week in Miami. The same goes for that Elway guy, along
with several other Falcons and Broncos owning profiles nearly as
high as beach-front mortgages around South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   That said, we're back to our pick as a hidden star among stars
during this time before the Super Bowl, and he hasn't worn a helmet
in years. He also won't dabble in game plans for either side.
Still, with those searching the globe for new angles to describe
the Dirty Bird, Johnson will have somebody or something in his face
early and often.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's already happening,'' said Johnson, officially the
Falcons' coordinator of player programs. Nevertheless, as the
Falcons fly deeper into January and the number of those doing the
Dirty Bird increases by a bunch, Johnson unofficially has become
the world's go-to guy on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Such a distinction makes sense. Long before you had Deion's
Dance, the Ickey Shuffle, the Fun Bunch, the Broncos Salute or
Butch Johnson's ``Quake,'' there was William Arthur Johnson,
period. That, along with his eternal white shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Before Johnson spent 15 professional seasons through 1988
wobbling his legs in celebration of touchdowns, he was doing the
same at Pennsylvania's Widener College.
</P>
<P>
   Some called it ``The Funky Chicken.'' Others called it ``Rubber
Legs.'' Many called it something not fit for a family newspaper,
especially when those watching weren't partial toward Widener or
Johnson's Houston Oilers during the beginning of his NFL career or
his Falcons at the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of that was done to try to demean anybody, and that's the
same with the Dirty Bird,'' said Johnson. Then he suggested with a
wink that he invented end-zone dancing after taking lessons on
tapping and ballet while wishing to become Bojangles or Fred
Astaire.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said, ``I did all kinds of stuff. I would dance or I
would bow in awe of something I accomplished. It really was fun,
and this (Dirty Bird) is exactly the same. This is one of the
things that people will always remember about this team.''
</P>
<P>
   So has Johnson done the Dirty Bird? He laughed, saying, ``People
ask, but I haven't done it. I'll tell you this: If they win the
Super Bowl, I'll do it, and I won't need music.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   In a sign of how fast the American economy was growing at the
end of the year and how quickly many other economies were slowing,
the U.S. trade deficit widened sharply in November, setting a
record for a year in just 11 months.
</P>
<P>
   As consumers and businesses took advantage of import bargains
and exporters struggled to sell in shrinking markets, the gap
between American exports and imports jumped to $15.5 billion from
$13.5 billion in October, the Commerce Department reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   With December remaining to be counted, the deficit for 1998 has
already reached $153.9 billion, making it the worst year for trade
since 1987, when the deficit was $153.4 billion, the previous
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pretty lousy report,'' said William Dudley, chief
economist at Goldman, Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the deficit is not nearly as big relative to the
size of the economy _ 2 percent of the gross domestic product in
1998 compared with 3.3 percent in 1987. And despite the surge in
November, Dudley and other forecasters estimate that the economy
grew at an annual rate of at least 4 percent in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Things are likely to get worse before they get better, and
further deterioration in the trade deficit may well slow the pace
of what has become the longest peacetime expansion in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Asian economic crisis may be easing, growth in
Europe is slowing and much of Latin America is stagnating or
slipping into recession.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, any lift that American exports get from the weaker
dollar will most likely take months to materialize. Most
forecasters think the trade deficit will keep getting bigger,
although not as rapidly as in parts of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Exports, which have been declining for most of the last year,
fell by an additional 2 percent in November. The hardest-hit
category was capital equipment _ aircraft, trucks and computers _
which accounts for nearly one-quarter of U.S. foreign sales.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, imports of construction gear, machine tools
and other capital equipment soared _ suggesting that American
businesses were not cutting back as much on new investment as some
economists had feared.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in the trade deficit is actually worse than the figures
indicate because import prices have been falling in dollar terms as
the currencies of Asian and Latin American countries have weakened
and the world market for raw materials from copper to oil has
plunged. On average, imported goods are 3.5 percent cheaper than a
year earlier, while the cost of foreign petroleum products is down
more than 34 percent. That means the volume of imports is even
bigger than the statistics would indicate.
</P>
<P>
   Because of seasonal quirks in the Commerce Department's trade
statistics, the figures typically look deceptively good in the
fourth quarter. The fact that the fourth-quarter numbers look as
bad as they do at this point does not bode well for the current
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, the bulging trade deficit has become a serious
concern for the Clinton administration, underscored by the
president's harsh words for Japanese steelmakers in his State of
the Union address Tuesday night and his call for a new round of
global trade talks. The administration had already been urging the
Europeans to import more, saying that the United States could not
be the importer of only resort.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although the deficits with Japan and China appeared to narrow,
indicating that the recent weakening of the dollar against the yen
was having some effect, the true picture is hard to measure because
trade figures from those countries, which are not seasonally
adjusted, among other things, are widely questioned.
</P>
<P>
   Many American manufacturers have been hurt by intense price
competition over the last year, and weak export markets have helped
whittle away their profits, touching off a painful round of
cutbacks and layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The growing trade imbalance also has some potentially negative
implications for the dollar, as Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve
chairman, warned in his testimony to the House Ways and Means
Committee on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The United States' rapidly expanding current-account deficit _ a
broad measure of the nation's international transactions that
covers not only trade but also overseas transactions such as
tourism, investments, services and brokerage fees _ is becoming
sufficiently large to call into question foreign investors'
willingness to keep putting money into U.S. assets at the current
pace. If the appetite for U.S. assets no longer keeps pace with
Americans' appetite for imports, the dollar comes under a lot of
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the trade deficit continues to be a boon to an
economy that has been running flat out. Because American resources
are stretched to the limit, with unemployment at its lowest level
in a generation, the trade deficit is an important safety valve
that helps keep inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had not had all the imports, the economy would have had
to expand far beyond its capacity to do so,'' said Pierre Ellis of
Primark Decision Economics. ``It's hard to believe that we wouldn't
have had more inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   If, for example, the trade deficit had not worsened this year,
the economy would have had to grow 5.5 percent, instead of the
estimated 4 percent or so, to keep up with roaring domestic demand.
It is also hard to see how real incomes could have risen as they
did if imports and foreign competition had not held down the prices
of a wide variety of goods from clothes and heating oil to
electronic gadgets.
</P>
<P>
   A separate report Thursday from the Department of Labor hinted
at a possible softening in the tight labor market. First-time
unemployment claims fell by 14,000, to 346,000 for the week ending
on Jan. 16. But the four-week moving average, which economists
prefer because it gives a truer reading of the underlying trend,
rose to its highest level since early 1996 except for the period
during a strike against General Motors last summer.

EDITORIAL: DEFENSE AGAINST A MISSILE ATTACK   
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Alaska, Hawaii)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Jan. 22:
</P>
<P>
   During the Cold War, when the only real missile threat to
America came from the Soviet Union, building missile defenses was
rightly seen as a bad idea. The other side simply would build more
offensive missiles so that some got through any shield. Today's
world is different, with reckless lesser powers like North Korea
developing long-range missiles that could one day reach U.S. soil.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is right to devote money and effort
to designing a limited missile defense system to counter this
potential threat. But America's preparations have to be guided by
the imminence of the danger, the technical challenges and the
possible diplomatic consequences for managing nuclear relations
with Russia and China.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is acting responsibly in moving ahead with a
$4 billion research and testing program over the next six years and
setting aside $6.6 billion for possible future construction. But
the White House must not let itself be rushed into a premature
decision to proceed with construction. North Korea is closer to
being able to launch a missile attack on the United States than was
previously thought. The three-stage rocket it tested last year,
once perfected, would probably be able to reach parts of Alaska and
Hawaii. What must now be determined is what kind of technologies
can be produced to intercept a limited number of missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Despite 40 years of research and testing, America does not yet
have a reliable shield against long-range missiles. The challenge
is formidable, akin to shooting at speeding bullets. But some day a
reliable system will probably be developed. The actual building of
a defense system should wait until it is.
</P>
<P>
   Missile defenses are currently restricted by a 1972 treaty
between the United States and Russia. That treaty underpins current
nuclear arms reduction agreements between the two countries, since
neither would be willing to reduce its arsenal if its missiles were
likely to be intercepted in midflight.
</P>
<P>
   Renegotiating the treaty to allow a limited defensive system
directed against North Korea and other rogue states may be
possible, despite Russia's current reluctance to do so. But the
subject must be approached carefully. Defense Secretary William
Cohen's threat that America could simply renounce the treaty if
Russia resists amendments was a poor way to start this discussion.

   Details of charges against the president and his defensec. 1999
Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is charged with two articles of impeachment,
alleging perjury and obstruction of justice. Here are the details
of the charges with the House prosecutors' claims and the
president's defense:
</P>
<P>
   ARTICLE I: President Clinton ``willfully provided perjurious,
false and misleading testimony to the grand jury'' about:
</P>
<P>
   The nature and details of his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors allege that Clinton lied in the grand jury
when he described the start of his relationship with the Lewinsky
and the frequency of their contacts. They also say he lied when he
affirmed his civil deposition testimony that he believed he did not
have sexual relations with Lewinksy, as defined in the Paula Jones
case. Specifically, House managers allege Clinton lied when he said
he did not touch Lewinsky on her breasts, or seek to gratify her
sexually. They also allege that Clinton lied when he said his
relationship began sometime in January 1996, instead of November
1995 as Lewinsky has said. The president also lied when he said his
meetings and phone conversations with Lewinsky were only
occasional.
</P>
<P>
   Response: Clinton testified in the grand jury that the
definition was confusing and that he was responding to what he
thought the narrow definition of sexual relations meant. By
admitting to an inappropriate intimate relationship with Lewinsky,
Clinton cannot be charged with trying to conceal the relationship
in his grand jury testimony. The discrepancies between Lewinsky's
and Clinton's testimony over where he touched Lewinsky and when
their relationship began are not meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   Prior perjurious, false and misleading testimony given in the
Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit filed against the president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton lied when he repeated false answers he made in his
deposition in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   Response: The House specifically defeated a proposed article of
impeachment alleging perjury in the Jones deposition. The
prosecutors are attempting to resurrect that article.
</P>
<P>
   Prior perjurious, false and misleading testimony that he allowed
his attorney to make before a federal judge in the Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors allege that Clinton sat silently while his
attorney Robert Bennett told the federal judge in the Jones case
that the president had had no sex of any kind with Lewinsky.
Clinton said that he wasn't really paying attention to what Bennett
was saying, a statement they believe is a lie. They maintain that a
videotape of the deposition clearly shows Clinton is closely
observing the exchange between Bennett and the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Response: At issue is Clinton's state of mind. He has said what
he was thinking. The videotape shows that Clinton responded no
differently at this moment than during other exchanges in the
course of the deposition.
</P>
<P>
   Corrupt efforts to influence the testimony of Lewinsky, Betty
Currie and White House aides to impede the discovery of evidence in
the Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In the grand jury, Clinton denied trying to influence Lewinsky,
Currie and White House aides to lie or conceal evidence. House
managers allege this is a lie.
</P>
<P>
   Response: Clinton's testimony is supported by Lewinsky, who said
she was never asked to lie. Currie's testimony also bolsters
Clinton's contention because she said the idea of concealing gifts
the president gave Lewinsky originated with Lewinsky. Clinton's
misleading statements to his aides mirror what he was telling his
family and the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ARTICLE II: President Clinton ``prevented, obstructed and
impeded the administration of justice'' and participated in a
scheme to ``delay, impede, cover up, and conceal the existence of
evidence and testimony'' related to the Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   On or about Dec. 17, 1997, Clinton corruptly encouraged Lewinsky
to file an affidavit about their relationship that he knew to be
false.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the morning of Dec. 17, Clinton and Lewinsky spoke by
phone and Clinton informed Lewinsky she was a witness in the Jones
case, telling her that she could file an affidavit. House
prosecutors say Clinton and Lewinsky had an understanding that she
would lie about the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Response: Clinton testified that he never encouraged Lewinsky to
file a false affidavit, a point Lewinsky supported when she
testified that Clinton never asked her to lie. Lewinsky also
believed that, under her definition of sexual relations, her denial
of a sexual relationship was accurate because the two never had
intercourse.
</P>
<P>
   On or about Dec. 17, 1997, Clinton corruptly encouraged Lewinsky
to give false and misleading testimony if called to testify in the
Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In the same conversation, House prosecutors allege Clinton
suggested to Lewinsky that she could discuss ``cover stories''
about their relationship if ever asked personally.
</P>
<P>
   Response: Lewinsky testified that no one ever asked her to lie,
and she made that statement under threat of prosecution for perjury
and revocation of her immunity agreement. Clinton and Lewinsky
discussed cover stories, what Clinton lawyer David Kendall called
``an almost inevitable part of every improper relationship.'' But
they did so before Lewinsky was on the Jones case witness list.
</P>
<P>
   On or about Dec. 28, 1997, Clinton sought to prevent gifts given
by him to Lewinsky from being subpoenaed in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 28, Clinton and Lewinsky met at the White House and
exchanged Christmas gifts. Lewinsky mentioned she was concerned
about the gifts she had from him and asked whether she should move
them outside her apartment. In one of10 versions Lewinsky gave
prosecutors, she quoted Clinton as saying ``I'll think about it.''
House prosecutors allege Clinton then instructed Currie to retrieve
the gifts from Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Response: The record contains no evidence that Clinton ordered
Currie to hold on to the gifts. Clinton and Currie testified no
such order was given, and Lewinsky has said Clinton was not
thinking about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning on or about Dec. 7, 1997, Clinton intensified efforts
to secure Lewinsky a job in order to influence her testimony in the
Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky began looking for a job in New York over the summer of
1997, and enlisted Clinton's friend, Vernon Jordan, to help. House
prosecutors allege Jordan treated the request as a low priority
until December, when Lewinsky turned up on the Jones witness list
and U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright ruled that Jones's
lawyers could ask Clinton about alleged sexual relationships. At
that point, Jordan helped her find a job at Revlon.
</P>
<P>
   Response: Jordan, Lewinsky, Clinton and executives at Revlon,
its parent company and other companies at which Lewinsky
interviewed but did not receive job offers, have all testified
there was no link between aiding Lewinsky's job search and
influencing her testimony. Jordan and Lewinsky agreed in November,
before the witness list appeared, that they would get together in
December. The prosecution contention that Wright's ruling on Dec.
11 brought a new urgency to the job search fails because her order
came after Lewinsky and Jordan met that day. Had Clinton wanted to
silence Lewinsky, he could have offered her a job at the White
House, which she badly wanted.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 17, 1998, Clinton corruptly allowed his attorney to make
false and misleading statements about his relationship with
Lewinsky to a federal judge in order to prevent the judge from
asking relevant questions.
</P>
<P>
   House managers allege that Clinton's silence in the Jones
deposition had the effect of obstructing justice by preventing the
judge from knowing the truth about the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Response: Clinton has said he was not paying close attention
when Bennett presented an affidavit from Lewinsky denying a sexual
relationship. Moreover, Jones's lawyers already knew of Clinton's
relationship with Lewinsky because of a briefing they had received
from Linda Tripp. In addition, Wright ruled against Clinton's
lawyer's attempt to limit the questioning of the president about
his alleged relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   On or about Jan. 18, Clinton related a ``false and misleading
account'' about his relationship with Lewinsky to his secretary
Betty Currie, in order to corruptly influence her testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The day after his Jones deposition, Clinton called Currie to the
White House and asked her four rhetorical questions about what she
knew or may have seen about his contacts with Lewinsky. One such
question was ``I was never really alone with her, right?''
according to Currie. House managers allege these questions were
meant to signal to Currie that she should lie about the
relationship if asked.
</P>
<P>
   Response: Currie was not a witness in the Jones case, and the
period for the lawyers to gather evidence and interview witnesses
was nearing its close. Clinton has sought to explain the questions
as a way of preparing himself and Currie for anticipated press
inquiries, but White House deputy counsel Cheryl Mills said the
president was trying to probe his secretary to see what she knew.
</P>
<P>
   On or about Jan. 21, 23 and 26, Clinton made ``false and
misleading'' statements to aides about his relationship with
Lewinsky in order to influence their testimony.
</P>
<P>
   After his deposition, and after denying to the public that he
had a relationship with Lewinsky, Clinton repeated his denials to
senior aides. House managers allege that Clinton's purpose was to
give them false information that they would then repeat in the
grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Response: None of the aides was a witness in the Jones case and
had no independent evidence to offer. It would have been
``absurd,'' Kendall said, for Clinton to lie to his family and the
nation, but tell a different story to his aides. As for the grand
jury, the aides repeated accurately what the president told them.
Their testimony about the Clinton-Lewinsky relationship was
hearsay, that is, they had no independent knowledge of the
relationship, only what the president told them.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Jan. 22:
</P>
<P>
   Probably no one who has ever gotten a pie in the face thinks the
event was remotely funny. But those who find themselves taking
creamy globs out of their eyes rarely, if ever, seek to bring the
perpetrators to justice. Some no doubt fear that would only subject
them to further ridicule for being humorless. But San Francisco's
Mayor, Willie Brown, had no such qualms when he pressed charges
against the Biotic Baking Brigade, a protest group that pied him
last November.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants, known as the Cherry Pie Three, wanted to express
their dismay at Brown's treatment of homeless people. They were
charged with assault on a public official and misdemeanor battery.
This week a jury found them guilty of battery _ an unwanted
touching _ which could mean a sentence of up to six months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to dismiss a whipped cream attack as more comedy than
crime. But the jury, while not holding the defendants liable for
assaulting an official, which would require intent to prevent the
mayor from carrying out his duties, decided that shoving a pie into
anyone's unconsenting face is illegal contact. That is a reasonable
judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Pie-throwing has a long cinematic history, but off the stage or
screen it is not behavior that anyone, including the pie-throwers,
would want inflicted on himself. The protesters have freedom of
speech to ridicule and mock politicians, but pie-hurling is a
hostile physical encounter.

 &HT;    Drives change Chandler image
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Falcons quarterback Chris Chandler's reputation
changed in half an hour Sunday, when he led Atlanta on a
last-minute, eight-play, 71-yard game-tying drive in the Metrodome
and then a 10-play, 70-yard drive that set up the game-winning
field goal in the NFC Championship Game.
</P>
<P>
   For most of his 11-year career, Chandler gained attention for
injuries. Leading a team to the Super Bowl, however, is a good way
to change one's image.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler was named NFL Offensive Player of the Week after
completing 27 of 43 passes against the Vikings for 340 yards and
three touchdowns. But it was the drives that did it, as Atlanta
beat the Vikings 30-27 on Morten Andersen's 38-yard field goal with
3:08 left in overtime. Chandler completed seven of nine passes on
the two drives, for 103 yards and a touchdown _ a 151.4 passer
rating. He also rushed for 15 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons will ride a hot quarterback into Super Bowl XXXIII.
Chandler also was named NFC Offensive Player of the Month in
December, and over the past six games he has a passer rating of
118.6.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was definitely the best drive I've ever been associated
with, no question,'' he said. ``And the second-best would be the
one we ... kicked the field goal on. But a lot of other people had
a big hand in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler, who finished No. 2 in the NFL in 1997 and No. 4 this
season in passer rating, has quarterbacked the Falcons to wins the
past two weeks over both of his Pro Bowl counterparts _ Steve
Young's 49ers, and Randall Cunningham's Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was as good as I've been around,'' coach Dan Reeves said.
``It was very similar to the drive when we were in Cleveland.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves referred to the Broncos' 15-play, 98-yard, game-tying
drive in the AFC Championship Game at Cleveland after the 1986
season. The Broncos were quarterbacked by John Elway, who will be
at the helm Jan. 31 in Miami. His 5-yard touchdown pass to Mark
Jackson with seven seconds left pushed the game against Cleveland
to overtime, where Denver won 23-20 on a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Denver lost Super Bowl XXI 39-20 to the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ON A ROLL
</P>
<P>
   Chris Chandler was NFC Offensive Player of the Month in
December, and he has maintained the pace in two playoff games.

 &HT;    Bradford hopes to reclaim starting job
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With Super Bowl XXXIII nine days away, the Falcons are
doing plenty of juggling in their secondary, but one move appears
set. Cornerback Ronnie Bradford looks ready to move back into the
starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford missed the Jan. 9 playoff game against San Francisco
with a slight shoulder separation suffered in the final
regular-season game, Dec. 27 against Miami. In Sunday's game at
Minnesota, he replaced injured nickel safety Devin Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The shoulder has improved. ``It's probable (Bradford) will
re-take that cornerback spot this week because he looks better,''
defensive coordinator Rich Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have multiple decisions in the secondary before
facing Denver's passing attack, which ranked No. 7 in NFL. The
Broncos' top receiving threats are wide receivers Rod Smith (6
feet, 196 pounds; 86 catches, 1,222 yards, six touchdowns) and Ed
McCaffrey (6-5, 215; 64 catches, 1,053 yards, 10 TDs) and tight end
Shannon Sharpe (6-2, 228; 64 catches, 768 yards, 10 TDs).
</P>
<P>
   Bradford, a 5-foot-10, 188-pounder who played the first three
years of his six-year career for the Broncos, started the first
seven games of the season before straining knee ligaments Oct. 25
against the Jets. He missed the next six starts, including all of
two games.
</P>
<P>
   Booker (6-2, 203), the team's first-round draft choice in 1997,
showed dramatic improvement in Bradford's absence, finishing the
regular season with 45 tackles, one interception and 11 pass
breakups in 14 games. He also started both playoff games, and might
be the team's most physical cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford is perhaps less gifted physically than Booker, but he
is technically more sound. He finished the season with 40 tackles,
three interceptions and 11 pass breakups.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the shoulder holds up,'' Bradford said, ``I'll be in the
starting lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   The other starting cornerback is Ray Buchanan (5-9, 198).
</P>
<P>
   Bush practiced Thursday for the second day in a row after
missing the Minnesota game with a strained hamstring. After coming
back from a preseason knee injury, he was the backup for the final
13 games at both safety spots, and replaced strong safety William
White in passing situations.
</P>
<P>
   Bush probably will play. If he can't, Bradford might play the
nickel safety spot on passing downs, with Booker taking over his
cornerback spot and Randy Fuller (5-10, 175) playing the nickel, or
slot, corner spot.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush plays, the question is who will play nickel cornerback.
Fuller has played there occasionally this season. Defensive
coaches, however, will consider putting Booker in Bradford's spot
in passing downs and moving Bradford, a better cover man, into the
nickel cornerback spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we do in the nickel is still up for discussion ...
because different people have played those roles and played them
well,'' Brooks said. ``The choices are harder because guys are
getting healthy.''

EDITORIAL: ENDING THE ARGUMENTS   
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Jan. 22:
</P>
<P>
   The senators have now heard the House prosecutors and President
Clinton's lawyers debate both the evidence and the Constitution.
They have heard hours of argument as to whether they should be
punitive or forgiving about the fact that Clinton lied under oath.
But what they have not heard is a convincing argument that his
misconduct, whether viewed darkly or with compassion, meets the
standard for removal spelled out in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   That is because Dale Bumpers, the former senator who concluded
the president's defense with a geyser of folksy oratory, was right.
Clinton's conduct can be described as indefensible, outrageous and
shameless. But it does not constitute the ``distinctly political
offense against the state'' that the Framers regarded as necessary
for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The majority leader, Trent Lott, suggested that he grasped this
by urging the senators to conclude their questioning of the
presenters by Friday afternoon. That would clear the way for a vote
early next week that would demonstrate that the 67 votes required
for removal are not there. It is time for such a vote, and it is in
the political interests of both sides to have it as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats want it because they sense that the steam will go
out of the prosecution once the public sees a convincing test vote.
The Senate Republicans, for their part, want to get loose from this
issue. The House prosecutors have not been able to spread their
passion to the senators of their own party. Most of them realize
that if the Rev. Pat Robertson is willing to concede that the
president cannot be removed, it is time to settle up.
</P>
<P>
   Lott's immediate problem is still that of getting around the
question of calling witnesses. It will be an unproductive exercise.
We believe, like the big majorities in the polls, that a
common-sense analysis of the record shows that Clinton gave false
testimony under oath and tried to impede justice. We also grant
that the Clinton defense team raised reasonable questions about
whether this conduct would be found by a court to meet the legal
definition of perjury and obstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Those questions would be worth resolving if the offenses were of
sufficient scale. But six days of argument have demonstrated that
more testimony about ambiguities and conflicts in the evidence
would not raise the constitutional weight of the offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday Rep. Henry Hyde warned against a ``rush to judgment''
because he sensed that the Senate is ready to conclude. There will
be a lot of skirmishing over the witness issue during the weekend.
Lott should insist that none can be called unless they add striking
new evidence. If that is the standard, the Senate can be ready to
vote down removal and move on to censure early next week.

CHANCE OF SENATORS HEARING WITNESSES FADING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ What seemed a certainty just two days ago _ the
calling of witnesses, even Monica S. Lewinsky, to the Senate floor
_ no longer appears inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Though witnesses may yet appear at the impeachment trial of
President Clinton, several Democratic senators described a
``softening on the Republican side.'' And as senators poured out of
the chamber Thursday after a powerful closing speech from the White
House defense, several Republicans showed signs the party
solidarity is in serious jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we ought to hear witnesses, unless they're going
to add a lot to the case,'' said Senator Richard C. Shelby, a
Republican from Alabama. ``Especially if it's going to be
redundant, or if it's a witness that's just going to make a
spectacle of the Senate. And I'm not alone.''
</P>
<P>
   One Republican senator, Gordon Smith of Oregon, even signaled a
willingness to acquit Clinton on one of the impeachment charges,
saying the White House lawyers ``damaged the allegations of perjury
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I went into this believing that to remove a president of the
United States I needed to be persuaded he could be convicted of
these felonies in a court,'' Smith said. ``They've raised
reasonable doubt in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican mood swing became obvious after an afternoon of
forceful oratory from former Democratic Senator Dale Bumpers of
Arkansas, who filled his closing remarks with direct personal
appeals to senators he worked with for 24 years. But according to
some, the shift had actually started the night before, and was
inspired not only by the persuasiveness of the White House case but
also by a challenge plaguing many Republicans: how to avoid
plunging into a protracted, ugly trial.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby said he would change his mind, and would vote to hear
witnesses, if either side could prove the testimony was absolutely
central to the case, and only after hearing exactly what each
witness would say. Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Republican from Texas,
voiced similar reservations the day before.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans seemed willing to speeding up the trial in other
ways as well. On Wednesday, when Senator John F. Kerry began
pushing a plan to vote on the articles of impeachment before
hearing any witnesses, some Republicans quietly expressed interest,
Democrats said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I heard today was that the hardcore Republicans were
ready to go directly to the articles (of impeachment), to vote
directly on the articles,'' said Senator Max Cleland, a Democrat
from Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sense I have is that whatever momentum the Republicans
generated by their case has been dissipated significantly,'' said
Senator Jack Reed, a Democrat of Rhode Island. ``That, I think, is
growing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is expected to vote early next week on whether to
hear witnesses and whether to dismiss the case.
</P>
<P>
   Republican concern for defections was matched on the Democratic
side by worries that some of their own might turn against the White
House, breaking ranks to allow witness testimony. Already, Senator
Bob Graham, a Democrat from Florida, has signaled stubborn
independence, announcing last week that he would vote against any
motion to dismiss the case.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats _ among them senior Senators Robert C. Byrd of
West Virginia and Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York _ have been a
source of worry for the party, refusing to voice an objection to
calling witnesses. But concern over a Democratic split seemed to
have subsided by late Thursday, and Senator Edward M. Kennedy said
the White House presentation was largely the reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a continuation, after this excellent presentation, is
really going to be an embarrassment for the United States Senate,''
Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Among Republicans, the official veneer of unity remained
unchanged. Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi denied any
Republicans were distancing themselves from the party, and said any
statements to that effect were fabrications spun by Democrats.
Senator Orrin Hatch, a Republican from Utah, sounded a similar
warning, interpreting his colleagues' comments as a boost for
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's more momentum to have witnesses,'' Hatch said.
``There are so many conflicts here that the only way you can
resolve them is with witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   And Representative Henry Hyde, the Republican from Illinois who
heads prosecution team, continued his campaign to push the
impeachment trial ahead, cautioning his colleagues against making
up their minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be a mistake to rush to judgment simply
because, as people keep repeating, never tire of saying, this is
one of the most important votes you'll ever make,'' Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans had already done just that. Senator Jesse Helms
of North Carolina left the proceedings as committed to a full trial
as he had been from the start. He said he ``absolutely'' wanted to
hear from witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what impact Bumpers had on his thinking, Helms replied:
``He didn't change my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   But Senator Conrad Burns _ a conservative Republican from
Montana _ said his colleagues were now ``running in neutral'' on
the witness issue, not pushing forcefully ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was still at the top of the party's agenda; early
Thursday, Republicans talked in their caucus about taking witness
depositions, assessing the length of time it would take, and where
it would lead next. And there was consensus on one point, Burns
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think,'' Burns said, ``what we want to do is to bring this
thing to a close as fast as we can.''

RIGHT TIME FOR A RESPITE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Ken Hitchcock is going to Disney World ...
literally.
</P>
<P>
   Before taking on the responsibilities of being the coach of team
North America at the 49th NHL All-Star Game this weekend in Tampa,
Fla., Hitchcock planned to take a brief vacation with his family
today at the nation's most popular amusement park.
</P>
<P>
   But the Stars coach knows better than anyone that if he is to
utter the phrase that is reserved for sports champions these days,
his team has a lot of work to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a huge improvement that needs to be made,
especially in the transition part of the game,'' Hitchcock said in
his state of the team address after a 6-4 loss to the Toronto Maple
Leafs on Wednesday. The defeat throws the Stars into the six-day
All-Star break on their worst skid of the season _ 2-4-1 in their
past seven games. To put that in perspective, the Stars lost five
of their first 36 games.
</P>
<P>
   And while the end result is the best record in the NHL _ 27-9-7,
good for 61 points and a .709 winning percentage _ the Stars and
Hitchcock will have plenty to chew on during their midseason
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the overall perspective, you want to be in first place,''
Hitchcock said. ``But from where our game is right now, I think
we've got a lot of room to improve. I think our game has been
pretty consistent, but there's huge room for improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock emphasized that the recent slump is because of mental
and physical breakdowns in the transition game, poor attempts to
clear the puck from the defensive zone and weak play on the puck
that has led to turnovers. Before playing the Maple Leafs, the
Stars also were getting little scoring help from their second,
third and fourth lines.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, when the goaltending was good in losses to Calgary
and Vancouver two weeks ago, the team couldn't score, and the
result was 2-0 and 1-0 defeats. In the loss to the Leafs, the
forwards generated multiple scoring chances, but the goaltending
broke down.
</P>
<P>
   The goaltending breakdown can be seen as a fluke. The Stars rank
among the NHL leaders, allowing 2.04 goals per game. Ed Belfour has
been selected as an All-Star Game participant and Roman Turek has a
7-1-2 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goaltending has been very strong all year, and there's no
reason to think it won't be in the second half,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other concerns. The defensive pair of Derian
Hatcher and Richard Matvichuk are struggling and have to get back
on track, Hitchcock said. As the team's top two defenders, they
carry a heavy load of responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we've done in the first part of the season is to
play with composure in our own end,'' Hitchcock said. ``But I think
if you look at the last six games, we've played with a little bit
of panic in our end. We've got to replace panic with composure, and
it starts with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars also need Joe Nieuwendyk healthy and playing well.
Nieuwendyk, who had surgery on both knees in May, has struggled
through the first half of the season and missed the past five games
with tendinitis in the right knee. He has nine goals through 34
games after scoring 39 in 73 games last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need Joe to come back and play well, and we need whoever it
is on the second line to contribute offensively,'' Hitchcock said.
``We thought Nieuwendyk, \RJamie\S Langenbrunner and \RGrant\S
Marshall were good as a line, and we'd like to get them back
together. We need that second wave to be much more of a scoring
force.'' But the bottom line is that if the playoffs started today,
the Stars would have the top seed in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, questions have to be answered, but the Stars believe they
have those answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every team goes through these things. We don't like it and I'm
sure the coaches don't like it,'' center Guy Carbonneau said. ``We
have a week to rest and come back fresh, and that's what we plan to
do. It's not going to be easy; we're first overall and teams are
going to come after us. But I don't think it's anything to be
worried about.''

EDITORIAL: SOCIAL SECURITY AND THE MARKET   
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Jan. 22:
</P>
<P>
   One day after President Clinton proposed shoring up the Social
Security system by investing a portion of its assets in the stock
market, Alan Greenspan stepped forward to say ``Not so fast.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not often that the notoriously circumspect chairman of the
Federal Reserve Board shoots at a major new administration plan,
and his concerns were well taken. As a matter of political reality,
both parties appear headed toward investment of Social Security
funds in the stock market, either by the system itself or by
individual participants. Forced to choose now, we prefer Clinton's
approach to that of the Republicans. But Greenspan's cautionary
comments should be useful in framing the debate.
</P>
<P>
   As most Americans have come to understand, the Social Security
system will start to run deficits in the next 15 years, when the
baby boomers begin retiring. Various steps can be taken to insure
its solvency over the next 75 years, including limiting benefits,
extending the age of retirement and raising taxes. But in part
because of the astonishing performance of the stock market in the
last few years, a consensus has emerged in Congress that some of
these steps might not be necessary if some of the system's trust
fund, which is generating surpluses at present, is invested in
stocks rather than low-yield Treasury securities, as it is now.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress want to strip away part of the current
Social Security tax for use in setting up individual retirement
accounts. Some want the entire system supplanted by such a scheme.
</P>
<P>
   But individual retirement accounts, while possibly attractive to
some beneficiaries, would transform the entire system from a
guaranteed government benefit to something that would expose
retirees to unacceptable risk. Families of modest means would see a
large portion of their meager savings spent on administrative fees
of fund managers. Under many of the schemes, disabled people,
divorcees and widows who are now guaranteed a benefit would receive
far less than they do now. If individual accounts are desirable,
they need to be set up outside the Social Security system where
they cannot weaken the safety net.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan was right to warn that having the federal government
invest 15 percent of the trust fund in equities carries certain
dangers. He is especially worried that federal overseers will be
subjected to political pressures in making investment decisions.
But Greenspan and the Federal Reserve Board are themselves
testimony to the ability of Congress to create an administrative
body insulated from politics. Even though state and local pension
funds have used their assets to boycott South Africa and tobacco
stocks, their overarching fiduciary responsibilities have been
honored and these funds have protected retirees.
</P>
<P>
   Some idea that harnesses the long-term strength of the stock
market will very likely end up as part of any Social Security
bailout. But such a momentous proposal will require searching
debate over the wisdom of government entry into private markets,
and the best mechanism for doing it.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Federal officials seized a Panamanian-flag cargo
vessel with nearly five tons of cocaine in it in what officials
Thursday called the largest cocaine bust ever in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The ship, docked at the Port of Houston, was under heavy guard.
</P>
<P>
   A Coast Guard search team found the cocaine during a routine
search at sea 125 miles south of Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   The ship reached Houston on Wednesday and was unloaded Thursday
as agents in heavy assault gear and carrying submachine guns
patrolled the area.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Slater, secretary of Transportation, said the bust is the
largest cocaine seizure in Texas and one of the 10 largest in the
nation. He estimated the cocaine's street value at $375 million.
</P>
<P>
   The motor vessel Cannes has been detained, and the Greek master
and four crew members are under arrest, Slater said. The other 19
crewmen are being questioned. The crew includes several
nationalities, but most are Ukrainian, a Coast Guard official said.
</P>
<P>
   The 580-foot Cannes was also carrying 26,000 metric tons of iron
ore, believed to have been loaded in Brazil for transport to
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The ship's last port of call before being boarded was Punta
Buera, Trinidad, on Jan. 6.

administration, said the seizure sends a message to shippers that
the United States has zero tolerance ``against those who wish to
destroy our children.''
</P>
<P>
   The size of the shipment, he said, indicates there have been
previous shipments. ``Those who traffic in drugs would not send
that much on their first shipment,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard Commandant Adm. James M. Loy said a patrol plane
spotted the ship and guided a U.S. Navy patrol boat to the scene,
which officials described as a routine search.
</P>
<P>
   A Coast Guard team aboard the Navy boat was granted permission
to inspect the Cannes, Loy said.
</P>
<P>
   The team found indications that something might be hidden aboard
and called in search specialists who found the cocaine in bales
buried beneath five feet of iron ore.
</P>
<P>
   The Panamanian government then gave permission for Coast Guard
officials to enforce all applicable U.S. laws. The Customs Service
and the Drug Enforcement Administration will investigate the source
of the drugs and to whom they were bound.
</P>
<P>
   Loy said one of the Coast Guard's challenges is ``to extend our
borders as far away as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   International agreements allow such searches on the open sea, he
said, and had the Cannes captain refused, permission would have
been sought from the Panamanian government, which cooperates in
such matters.
</P>
<P>
   Loy said about 70 percent of all drugs comes into this country
across its Southwest borders and much of this comes by sea.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Cmdr. Peter Brown and Petty Officer James Sorenson, who
searched the Cannes, said they look for anything out of the
ordinary, such as new repairs on an old vessel, which might
indicate something is hidden behind the new surface.
</P>
<P>
   Searching the Cannes turned up no new repairs, but Brown said
there was evidence of activity in the No. 2 hold after its cargo
was loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said the passageway to the hold was clear, while
passageways to the other holds were choked with boxes, barrels and
trash. There were tracks _ iron ore is quite dusty _ indicating
someone had been in the hold.
</P>
<P>
   With these signs to guide them, Brown said, the searchers began
probing the hold full of ore with rods and eventually hit something
``that did not feel like iron ore.'' Digging revealed a large stack
of bales of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said the vessel's crew cooperated throughout the search
and the voyage on to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   National Guardsmen loaded the cocaine here into two large,
sealed trucks for removal from the dock.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Rimmer, director of the Port of Houston, said the cocaine
will be tested and stored in a secure location until the Department
of Justice decides how much to retain for evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder will be burned in an incinerator that will
vaporize the drug, leaving no residue, Rimmer said.

OFFICIALS SEIZE NEARLY 5 TONS OF COCAINE IN RECORD BUST

<P>
   HOUSTON _ Federal authorities seized a Panamanian-flag cargo
vessel with nearly five tons of cocaine in it in what officials
Thursday called the largest cocaine bust ever in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The ship, docked at the Port of Houston, was under heavy guard.
</P>
<P>
   A Coast Guard search team found the cocaine during a routine
search at sea 125 miles south of Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   The ship reached Houston on Wednesday and was unloaded Thursday
as agents in heavy assault gear and carrying submachine guns
patrolled the area.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Slater, secretary of Transportation, said the bust is the
largest cocaine seizure in Texas and one of the 10 largest in the
nation. He estimated the cocaine's street value at $375 million.
</P>
<P>
   The motor vessel Cannes has been detained, and the Greek master
and four crew members are under arrest, Slater said. The other 19
crewmen are being questioned. The crew includes several
nationalities, but most are Ukrainian, a Coast Guard official said.
</P>
<P>
   The 580-foot Cannes was also carrying 26,000 metric tons of iron
ore, believed to have been loaded in Brazil for transport to
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The ship's last port of call before being boarded was Punta
Buera, Trinidad, on Jan. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Lee Brown, a former drug czar in the Clinton
administration, said the seizure sends a message to shippers that
the United States has zero tolerance ``against those who wish to

TECH STOCKS DRAG MARKET DOWN; DOW OFF 71.83
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Internet and other technology stocks helped lead
equity markets lower Thursday as investors grappled with several
uncertainties.
</P>
<P>
   One was the question of how far Internet companies can go
without bringing home some earnings, a worry that has pushed these
stocks down sharply in the last week. Another was the outlook for
corporate earnings over all, as the reporting season for the fourth
quarter got into full swing.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were also taking note of Brazil, where the currency
dropped another 7 percent Thursday and the stock market fell 4.6
percent. Since Brazil devalued its currency, the real, on Jan. 13,
it is down 29 percent. In the same period, the Bovespa stock index,
even with Thursday's decline, is up 44.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the outlook remains uncertain because it is not clear yet
how successful Brazil's economic stabilization program will be in
the new environment of a floating currency.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street on Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average
dropped 71.83 points, or nearly 0.8 percent, to 9,264.08, while the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 21.46 points, or 1.7
percent, to 1,235.16. The Nasdaq composite index finished down
70.77 points, or 2.9 percent, at 2,344.72.
</P>
<P>
   Both the S&AMP;P and the Nasdaq are more heavily weighted with
technology stocks than is the Dow. The Russell index of 2,000
smaller-company stocks declined 6.57 points, or 1.5 percent, to
424.05.
</P>
<P>
   The recent spectacular runup in Internet stocks, which many
analysts are now routinely referring to as a bubble, was bound to
take some kind of pause. But for a lot of investors that
``correction'' may have been far more violent than they expected.
</P>
<P>
   The Street.com Internet index, which includes the likes of
Amazon.com, Excite, America Online and Yahoo, soared 308 percent
from the bottom of last year's technology-stock selloff Oct. 8
through its high Jan. 11. Since then it has fallen 17.9 percent,
including a 5.1 percent decline Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Even more unnerving has been the flight path of Amazon.com, the
Internet bookseller. On Jan. 8 it hit an intraday high of 199[ a
share. Thursday, at its intraday low, it was down more than 50
percent, at 92 9/16, in just eight trading sessions. It rallied
somewhat Thursday to finish down 7, at 106.
</P>
<P>
   Also leading the Internet decline Thursday were Excite, down 10
3/4 a share, to 85~; At Home, off 12], to 97], and Yahoo, down 22
3/16, to 265.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this Internet rally _ or frenzy _ is over or just taking
a break is hard to tell.
</P>
<P>
   In Tokyo on Thursday, Barton Biggs, the global strategist at
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, told Bloomberg News: ``I promise you
that, like all bubbles, this bubble will come to a very, very bad
end. The only trouble is that none of us know when.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas McManus, the equity strategist at NationsBanc Montgomery
Securities, suggests that the sector's retreat does not mean the
Internet will not bear fruit for investors. But it may mean some
investors are thinking like he is, that the big Internet names of
recent rallies may not be the big Internet winners in the future.
</P>
<P>
   In McManus' opinion, the real future winners could be
established companies, like Ethan Allen Interiors, that learn to
use the Internet as a tool. It will be easier, he said, for such
companies to develop their Internet skills than for some Internet
companies to develop their performances as, for example, a
furniture retailer.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig &AMP; Co. in Ryebrook,
N.Y., agrees.
</P>
<P>
   When shares of Amazon.com traded at nearly $200, its investors'
dream must have been that the company would expand well beyond
books and kill Wal-Mart, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, Barbera asked, ``Do you think that Wal-Mart will roll over
and die? Don't you think there will be a Wal-Mart.com?''
</P>
<P>
   On corporate earnings, a third of the companies in the S&AMP;P 500
index have reported so far for the fourth quarter. Of these, 54.4
percent have had positive earnings surprises while 21.6 percent
have had negative surprises, according to IBES International, a
research firm that tracks corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
   That performance is on par with recent quarters at the same
point.
</P>
<P>
   So far, earnings are up for the fourth quarter, but IBES expects
a decline when all the companies have reported.

 Boss' `Pet' Disheartens Co-Workers  &HT;       
 By Ilana DeBare  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  My co-workers and I are completely demoralized by
someone who is the boss' ``pet.'' This person is energetic and
ambitious and has won the boss' favor but treats the rest of us in
a high-handed, patronizing and downright rude manner. If you
confront him, he backs down but will stab you in the back later.
One of us complained to the boss, who simply said it's a
dog-eat-dog world and ``may the best person win.'' What should we
do?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  It sounds like there are two separate issues upsetting
your work group _ the boss' preference for one particular employee
and that employee's rudeness to everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   If I were you, I'd set aside my resentment of this employee
being a ``pet.'' Someone or other will always be viewed as the star
performer in an office. Instead of fretting, use this as a learning
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   What exactly has this fellow done to win the boss' favor? Some
of it _ like being a yes-man _ may be stuff you wouldn't want to
copy. But a large part of it may be positive. Look for what makes
him a star _ and adopt some of those behaviors to move your own
career forward.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, you've got a valid beef about this employee's
rudeness and the boss' indifference to the morale problems it's
causing.
</P>
<P>
   Try talking to the boss again as a group. Couch your concerns
professionally, so it's clear you're not just griping out of
jealousy. Focus on this employee's specific behaviors rather than
his personality. And explain how these behaviors are hurting
teamwork and productivity.
</P>
<P>
   If that doesn't work, executive coach Regina Hoffman suggests
that your group try a little bit of behavior modification on its &LR; 
own  &LR; . Remain courteous and professional at all times. But don't
let him get away with treating you rudely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get together, identify the unacceptable behavior, and come up
with a common response that everyone will use,'' said Hoffman, a
senior consultant with Valerie Frederickson &AMP; Co. in Menlo Park.
``It could be something along the lines of, `When I'm asked to do
work in that tone of voice, it goes to the bottom of my to-do pile.
What I need is to be asked in a tone of respect and courtesy.'''
</P>
<P>
   What if none of this helps?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd dust off that resume,'' said Susan Zitron, a career coach
with Zitron Career Services in Larkspur. ``There are plenty of
places looking for good, talented people who can be team players.
And sometimes, just knowing that you're looking for work can make
an intolerable situation tolerable until you leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Good News, Bad Timing
</P>
<P>
   Q: I lost my job last year because of companywide layoffs. Now,
the company is starting to hire people back. Our union contract
says that if clled back to work, we must return to the job within
two weeks or forfeit our return rights. Here's the catch: I'm
pregnant. What if I'm called back to work when I'm about to give
birth or I have a new baby? Is there any law requiring the company
to hold my job open during the time when I'd normally be on
maternity leave?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: You've got two pieces of wonderful news _ a new baby on
the way, and a chance to reclaim your old job.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of WORKWAYS () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  But the timing of the two could hardly be worse.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Family &AMP; Medical Leave Act requires most employers to
give new moms and dads up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave.
</P>
<P>
   But neither federal nor state leave laws apply to people who are
applying for work _ or in your case, being called back to work
after a period of unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Doris Ng, an attorney and FMLA expert with Equal Rights
Advocates in San Francisco, suggests that you read your union
contract carefully and see if there's any language that addresses
your situation.
</P>
<P>
   Check if the contract offers a return-to-work window that's
longer than two weeks for people with other kinds of illnesses or
disabilities. If so, there are state and federal laws against
pregnancy discrimination that would force the company to give you a
longer return period, too.
</P>
<P>
   But otherwise, the law doesn't offer any help in reconciling
this tough choice _ staying with your new baby or getting your old
job back.
</P>
<P>
   Your only option may be to rely on the sympathy and humanity of
this firm's managers. If you explain your situation to them, they
may be willing to voluntarily hold a position open for you until
you're ready to return to work.
</P>
<P>
   Commission Conflict
</P>
<P>
   Q: I worked in sales for a Denver company whose policies said
that it would pay the commissions on all products shipped prior to
the salesperson's termination. Now the company is refusing to pay
me about $70,000 in commissions that I rightfully earned. What
legal options do I have?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: It's not uncommon to see disagreements over commissions
when salespeople leave a firm, especially if the company's policies
are less than crystal-clear.
</P>
<P>
   Your case sounds more straightforward than many such disputes _
where a salesperson does 98 percent of the legwork but leaves a few
days before the final paperwork goes through.
</P>
<P>
   ``If in fact these orders shipped before she left, it sounds
like she's got an excellent claim,'' said Barry Roseman, a Denver
employment attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado state law says that employees who are illegally cheated
out of their wages can recover not just their pay, but a penalty
amounting to 50 percent of the disputed pay and some of their
attorneys' fees.
</P>
<P>
   You should start by notifying your employer in writing of how
much money you're owed and where the money should be sent, Roseman
said. Keep a copy of your letter. If the company doesn't pay up,
you may have to file a lawsuit: Call your county bar association
for the names of some experienced employment lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   With a hefty sum like $70,000 at stake, you shouldn't have
trouble finding someone who is willing to represent you.
</P>
<P>

Send your work and career questions to Ilana DeBare, Workways, San
Francisco Chronicle, 901 Mission St., San Francisco 94103. Or send

RAUL SALINAS IS JUDGED GUILTY AND SENTENCED TO 50 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (fe) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ After a tangled four-year trial, Raul Salinas de
Gortari, the brother of Mexico's former president, was convicted on
Thursday of ordering the 1994 assassination of a prominent
politician and sentenced to 50 years in prison. It was a stunning
verdict that shattered the impunity that has shielded powerful
Mexicans for decades.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's decision was widely considered to be the most
important criminal verdict in modern Mexico. It is the first time
that a close relative of a figure as powerful as the former
president, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, has faced punishment for a
serious crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``This breaks all the precedents,'' said Sergio Aguayo Quezada,
a historian. ``Raul Salinas is a symbol, the brother of one of the
strongest presidents Mexico has ever had. The judge's decision
gives an enormous boost to the independence of the justice
system.''
</P>
<P>
   But while strengthening Mexican justice, the case, which was
marred by missteps, coercion and manipulation by prosecutors, also
exposed the system's disarray. Raul Salinas was condemned mainly by
hearsay evidence, with the judge admitting there was no ``direct
proof.'' The verdict is likely to remain clouded by doubts over
whether his trial was a fair one. An appeal is already planned.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Salinas was found guilty of being the intellectual author
of the daylight assassination on Sept. 28, 1994, of Jose Francisco
Ruiz Massieu, who was then 48 and a fast-rising star in the
political party that governed Mexico for most of this century.
</P>
<P>
   The case became a mesmerizing drama, which divided families and
exposed the bizarre enmities and intrigues on the inside of a
long-stable political system that was in decline. The murder
charges against Raul Salinas did much to destroy the image of his
brother Carlos Salinas, who had been celebrated as a visionary
modernizer when he was president for six years until December 1994.
Carlos Salinas now lives in exile and has not been implicated in
the homicide.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have charged that the victim, who was a former
brother-in-law of the Salinas brothers, was also betrayed by his
own brother Mario, 49, who was the first prosecutor to investigate
the shooting, appointed by Carlos Salinas. Mario Ruiz Massieu
stands accused in Mexico of torturing witnesses and suppressing
evidence to conceal the role of Raul Salinas in the plot to kill
his brother. Mario Ruiz Massieu has denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
   As the Salinas family's popularity plummeted, prosecutors
persuaded judges to hold Raul ever since his arrest on Feb. 28,
1995, in a harsh isolation cell in Almoloya prison, Mexico's most
severe maximum security penitentiary, even though he had not been
convicted of any crime.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas protested his jail conditions to Mary Robinson, the U.N.
high commissioner for human rights, and she agreed to examine the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Under Mexico's justice system, there was no jury trial or
courtroom questioning of witnesses. The trial was conducted by
building a written record of nearly 140,000 pages on which a
federal district judge, Ricardo Ojeda Bohorquez, based his
decision. Ojeda signed the verdict and sentence Thursday afternoon
and sent his clerks to Almoloya prison to notify Raul Salinas, as
he stood at the bars of a general holding cell, of the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas's wife, Paulina Castanon, emerged from the prison
shortly afterwards, her eyes reddened. She said no family member
had been allowed to accompany Salinas when he was notified of the
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is totally devastating,'' Mrs. Castanon said. ``I will say
it again: Raul is innocent. He has been interred for four years in
a cement tomb.''
</P>
<P>
   His defense lawyers said they would file an appeal immediately.
Juan Velazquez, a lawyer for the Salinas family, said, ``I continue
to insist that all the so-called proof against Raul Salinas was
fabricated by prosecutors.''
</P>
<P>
   The accusations against Raul Salinas were based largely on
hearsay evidence from witnesses with obvious biases. Neither of the
two special prosecutors who worked to convict Salinas ever produced
any incontrovertible material evidence linking him to the crime.
</P>
<P>
   In his decision, Ojeda acknowledged there was no ``confession or
direct proof.'' He said his conclusions were derived from
``evidence which wove together in a logical way.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial record was filled with testimony and documentary
evidence that showed that several convicted members of the
assassination team tried to contact Raul Salinas in the hours and
days after the murder. A number of convicted conspirators insisted
in their statements that Raul Salinas had ordered the shooting.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The troubles in the legal case began within hours after Ruiz
Massieu was shot on a busy Mexico City street by a lone gunman, who
was captured at the scene. Under torture by police, the gunman,
Daniel Aguilar Trevino, soon named all of his closest accomplices.
He did not name Raul Salinas.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Salinas hastily appointed Mario Ruiz Massieu to
investigate the killing, even though Mexican law barred him from
investigating a crime against a close relative. Fernando and Jorge
Rodriguez Gonzalez, also brothers, who have been convicted and
jailed for plotting the homicide, testified that detectives working
for Mario Ruiz Massieu beat and brutalized them to force them to
omit reference they had made to Raul Salinas in their first
statements to police.
</P>
<P>
   The current president, Ernesto Zedillo, caused a political
upheaval when, three months after succeeding Carlos Salinas, he
ordered the arrest of Raul Salinas based on the investigations of
new prosecutors he named.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Ruiz Massieu, the first prosecutor, fled to the United
States after learning he would be prosecuted for obstruction of
justice in Mexico. He is under house arrest in New Jersey pending
the outcome of an appeal of his deportation from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But the second special prosecutor, Pablo Chapa Bezanilla, who
was named by Zedillo, also ended up as a fugitive from justice for
a time. Checks showed that Chapa made at least $500,000 in secret
payments to Fernando Rodriguez Gonzalez when he agreed to
strengthen his account that Raul Salinas had been the mastermind of
the plot.
</P>
<P>
   According to other convicted participants, Chapa also joined in
a bizarre caper to plant a body on property belonging to Raul
Salinas, in order to frame him. When local police exposed the
scheme, Chapa fled to Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he returned and was freed on all the charges of
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   The government's winning case was brought to a close by a third
prosecutor, Jose Luis Ramos Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Salinas was also convicted on Thursday on two lesser counts
of perjury and use of false documents. He has been acquitted of
three charges of financial fraud and tax evasion but still faces
one criminal charge of illicit enrichment during his years as a
government employee.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in Switzerland have confiscated more than $90
million from bank accounts linked to Salinas, arguing in civil
proceedings that the money came from drug payoffs. Salinas is also
under investigation in Mexico for narcotics, but no charges have
been brought.

 Genentech Earnings Surpass Estimates  &HT;       
 By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Strong sales of two new anti-cancer drugs helped Genentech Inc.
post fourth-quarter earnings yesterday that beat Wall Street's
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the year-end results bolstered the likelihood that
Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche Holdings, which now owns
two-thirds of Genentech, would leave well enough alone and not
exercise its option to buy the rest of the biotech giant on June
30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roche should be ecstatic with the way Genentech is being
run,'' said Meirav Chovav, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney in
New York. ``They're a smart company and they won't want to kill the
goose that laid the golden egg.''
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ending December 31, Genentech reported a net
income of $37.1 million (28 cents per share), beating the consensus
estimates which ranged from 13 to 23 cents per share.
Fourth-quarter revenues increased 10 percent, from $277 million
last year to $304 million in the quarter just ended. Despite that
revenue growth, year-over-year earnings per share slipped 11
percent from last year's 33 cents.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts shrugged off that comparison because last year's
earnings were bolstered by a one-time, $20 million royalty payment
that flowed straight to Genentech's bottom line. Analysts said
yesterday's results were based on strong sales of the new cancer
fighting drugs Rituxin and Herceptin, which will produce recurring
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new products were received far better than I had
expected,'' said Eugene Melnitchenko, who follows Genentech for
Sutro &AMP; Co. in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech said revenues rose 13 percent for the year, from
$1.016 billion in 1997 to $1.150 billion in 1998. Net income jumped
41 percent, from $129 million ($1.02 per share) in 1997 to $182
million ($1.40 per share) for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview yesterday, Genentech chief executive Art
Levinson said the company is seeing a decline in revenues of older
drugs like Activase, which dissolves blood clots. Activase sales
slipped $48 million, or 18 percent, from $261 million in 1997 to
$213 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   But those declines caused by competition were more than offset
by the nearly $200 million in 1998 sales of Rituxin and Herceptin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We beat our own revenue growth expectations,'' Levinson said.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of GENENTEC () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Genentech has several drugs nearing the end of the long Food and
Drug Administration trial process. And while no one can predict
whether these will win approval, Charles Engelberg of AmeriCal
Securities in San Francisco said, ``Wall Street is really impressed
with Genentech's product pipeline.''
</P>
<P>
   But hanging over Genentech is the Roche question. The Swiss
pharmaceutical giant has the right to buy the rest of Genentech by
June 30 for $82.50 per share. &UR;  &LR; Genentech gained 38 cents yesterday
to close at $79 and analysts are divided about whether Roche's
option is boosting or depressing the company's share price.
</P>
<P>
   However, the deadline may have less significance than is
generally understood. Under the complicated deal worked out between
the two companies in 1990, Roche could let the deadline pass and
later buy a larger stake in Genentech. Come July, Roche is also
free to appoint a majority of Genentech's board.
</P>
<P>
   Roche has not signalled its intent. That hasn't stopped analysts
from speculating about what will happen in June. Genentech
officials have made no secret of their desire to remain
independent, and any discussion about Roche control quickly leads
to veiled threats that Genentech's brains will walk out if the
Swiss company acts in a heavy-handed fashion.
</P>
<P>
   As analyst Chovav observed, ``Within a few days of a Roche
buyout, all the top people at Genentech will have five job
offers.''

UN IMPOTENCE IN ANGOLA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UN Secretary General Kofi Annan's desolating report to the
Security Council on the breakdown of peacekeeping operations in
Angola implicitly confirms the nasty wisdom of today's Realpolitik.
Annan's report, summarizing in dry language the immense suffering
of the Angolan population, leaves no doubt that despite the best
intentions, the United Nations remains impotent to stop a war that
both belligerents want to pursue.
</P>
<P>
   Angola's civil war has raged intermittently since the country
obtained its independence from Portugal in 1975. Until the end of
the Cold War, the warring parties were backed by the Soviet Union,
the United States, Cuba, South Africa, and, for a short while, even
Maoist China. In May 1991, a peace agreement was signed between the
government of Eduardo dos Santos, head of the Popular Movement for
the Liberation of Angola, and Jonas Savimbi, the leader of UNITA,
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola.
</P>
<P>
   Savimbi was supported by the apartheid regime in South Africa
and the Reagan administration. Dos Santos received arms from Moscow
and troops from Cuba. Today they are waging a conflict over power,
oil, and diamonds, which was always the case despite the Cold War
overlay.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side is ready to cede its dream of eliminating the
other. The UN has spent $1.5 billion and five years trying to
foster conditions for reconciliation and compromise _ to remove
land mines, improve medical care, and reconstruct civil society.
But last month, as hostilities resumed, two UN aircraft were shot
down in what Annan's report called ``a particularly outrageous
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite what the report foresees as a ``full-scale humanitarian
disaster,'' Annan has concluded that he has no choice but to
withdraw the personnel of the UN's observer mission in Angola.
``Obviously, the organization cannot impose its presence on the
Angolan parties, nor can it play an effective role without their
cooperation,'' Annan reported to the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   As long as it has no troops of its own, the UN cannot be a
peacemaker or even a peacekeeper.

 &HT;    Hawks land Johnson, West but rush far from finished
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``We've never been through anything like this,'' a
weary Stan Kasten said Thursday afternoon. He might have added he
hopes his Hawks (or Braves) never have to go through anything like
this again.
</P>
<P>
   In the mad rush (and sometimes panic) to bring players into NBA
camps Thursday, the Hawks were able to land a solid young point
guard and a grizzled backup center. But they had much left to
accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   Second year point Anthony Johnson agreed to a two-year deal for
the $1 million salary cap Thursday and will arrive here today to
sign his contract and perhaps practice in today's second practice.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen-year veteran Mark West, who played for Lenny Wilkens 11
years ago in Cleveland, will be signed as the Hawks backup center.
West is coming for the $1 million 10-year veterans' minimum.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great guy to have coming off the bench for me,'' Dikembe
Mutombo said.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson, 6-3, who started 62 games last season after a solid
career at College of Charleston, could become a fixture here. ``I
think the Hawks really have somebody to be excited about,'' agent
Richard Howell said Thursday. ``Anthony's not only a great kid, but
he's a true point guard who's only going to get better.'' He said
Johnson only came available through confusion in the Kings'
ownership change.
</P>
<P>
   Blessed with one real point and another in rookie Shammond
Williams who is developing, Mookie Blaylock was smiling Thursday
night. ``It's been years since I've had this kind of support,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks went to Life University for a practice when the gym
abruptly became available, but they have not come to agreement with
free agent forwards Alan Henderson or Tyrone Corbin. Williams,
first-round pick Roshown McLeod and free agent forward Chris
Crawford watched most of practice because their paperwork had not
been finished.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks still have their $1.75 million middle class exception
available and are taking a run at Corliss Williamson, runner up to
Henderson for the league's most improved player award after
averaging 19.7 points per game with the Kings last season.
Sacramento reportedly will renounce him to sign center Vlade Divac.
</P>
<P>
   In the hectic hours leading to Thursday's 2 p.m. start of
business, the Hawks had conversations with representatives of
flamboyant Charles Barkley (who later admitted he was going back to
Houston) and dealt free agent Christian Laettner to Detroit in a
sign-and-trade for a first-round draft pick (from Portland),
second-year players Scot Pollard, a center, and Ed O'Bannon, a
guard.
</P>
<P>
   The Laettner deal, delicately structured, nearly fell apart and
was made in lieu of a proposal from Milwaukee that would have sent
center Andrew Lang back to the Hawks along with forward Armon
Gilliam.
</P>
<P>
   Laettner nets a pro-rated $18-million, three-year contract, not
bad for a player who probably won't play this season after tearing
his Achilles in September. But it's a far cry from the $51 million
extension Laettner refused in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks now have three first-round picks in June, including
their own and Detroit's, provided the Pistons make the playoffs. If
Sacramento makes the Western Conference playoffs they will have a
fourth pick. The Portland selection was sent to Detroit in a deal
for Stacey Augmon. That player went to the Pistons with Grant Long
in 1996 when the Hawks cleared cap room so they could sign Dikembe
Mutombo.
</P>
<P>
   The wealth of picks is significant because Kasten said Thursday
the club will not have the wealth of cap room it believed would be
available in July. ``As much as $2 million would be a lot,'' Kasten
said Thursday. ``But with three picks we can talk about
sign-and-trades or using them to move up in the draft.''
</P>
<P>
   The most difficult part of the day for Kasten and general
manager Pete Babcock has been ongoing discussions with young
forward Alan Henderson, who wants substantially more money than the
team is willing to give him. Damaging Henderson's case are his very
limited options.
</P>
<P>
   There is simply not one team remaining that has enough cap room
to pose a threat to the Hawks. That leaves Henderson and his
representative Bill Strickland to take the estimated $4 to $5
million the Hawks are willing to pay, seek a satisfactory sign and
trade with another team or go after someone's $1.75 million cap
exception and wait 2 1/2 more years to cash in as a Larry Bird free
agent.
</P>
<P>
   A promising talent who became a productive starter only the
final three months of last season, Henderson has told the Hawks he
wants to remain with them. ``I think that is very important,''
Kasten said Thursday. But that desire was not enough to bring
Henderson to camp opening night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to stay out of (the actual negotiating),'' the
player said.

GUTTER POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Council of Conservative Citizens, an extremist organization
linked to several ostensibly mainstream politicians, from Trent
Lott, the Senate majority leader, to Dapper O'Neil, a Boston city
councilor, objects to being called a ``white supremacist group.''
Yet it is hard to see the council as anything other than plainly
racist.
</P>
<P>
   From its own mission statement: The council is ``dedicated to
restoring the civil rights of white Americans and preserving
America's culture and traditions.'' On its Web site, ``Views of the
C of CC,'' the group offers ``An open letter to white people'' and
``What a Southern nationalist movement should be.'' the last tract
calls for a ``constitutional assembly for a new country,'' to serve
as a bulwark against the ``third-world immigrants'' who are
``coming here by the millions. Bringing their false religions.
Bringing their inferior cultures.''
</P>
<P>
   These loony, hateful views would be just more babble in the
grand American conversation were it not for the legitimacy
conferred on them by political leaders such as Lott, US
Representative Bob Barr of Georgia, Republican National Committee
member Buddy Witherspoon, and Senator Jesse Helms, all of whom have
endorsed the council or spoken at its meetings. Witherspoon is a
member.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, a Mississippian, is distancing himself from the group now
that its views have become widely known, but as recently as 1997 he
was pictured grinning with members in its newsletter. It is hard to
swallow Lott's initial claim that he knew nothing about the group's
views when he agreed to speak and write for it; the council claims
34 Mississippi state legislators as members.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee chairman, Jim Nicholson, does
his party a great service by calling on all Republicans to resign
from the council. Any Democratic officeholders involved ought to
drop their affiliations as well.
</P>
<P>
   Black politicians who are found flirting with Louis Farrakhan's
separatist Nation of Islam are properly hammered for it. It is time
for white politicians to consider what it means to be one nation
indivisible and renounce these uncivil armies.

CLINTON WARNS OF DANGER OF TERRORIST ATTACKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: More to be filed) 
(mk) 
 By JUDITH MILLER AND WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Thursday that it was
``highly likely'' that a terrorist group would launch a germ or
chemical attack on American soil within the next few years and that
he is determined to take steps to deter such an attack while
protecting civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want the American people to know what they need to know
and have a realistic view of this,'' the president said in a
45-minute interview in the Oval Office, ``not to be afraid, or
asleep. I think that's the trick.''
</P>
<P>
   Highly animated and deeply engaged in the national security
issues he said he has worried about for the past six years, Clinton
dismissed those skeptical of novel threats and said it would be
``highly irresponsible of me'' not to take every ``appropriate''
step to protect Americans against terrorist attacks that used such
unconventional weapons as germs, chemicals, and computers.
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, Clinton said he is proposing or considering
wide-ranging measures, including the following:
</P>
<P>
   _ In addition to vaccinating against deadly anthrax the more
than 2 million Americans in the military, he said he is weighing a
proposal to give the vaccine to police, fire, public health and
other emergency service officials in cities throughout the country;
</P>
<P>
   _ He warned potential foes that any attack with unconventional
weapons would trigger ``at least a proportionate, if not a
disproportionate response.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Despite criticism from conservatives on Capitol Hill, he vowed
to forge ahead with cooperative programs with Russia aimed at
providing jobs to scientists who might otherwise be tempted to work
with rogue states or terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
   _ He said he is carefully weighing a proposal from the Defense
Department to establish for the first time a commander in chief for
homeland defense of the continental United States, which civil
libertarians have strongly resisted.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he hoped that a major legacy of his presidency
would be succeeding in staving off such an unconventional attack.
He said he would be delighted if decades from now, Americans looked
back on the threat as ``the dog that didn't bark.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton described how he had come to see germ, chemical and
computer attacks as the greatest emerging threat to national
security, the White House said Clinton would propose $2.8 billion
in his new budget to fight such unconventional terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Clinton plans to attend a ceremony at which an
expanded drive will be unveiled to combat exotic forms of terrorism
that he said would dominate national defense in the next century.
The steps include developing new vaccines, stockpiling antibiotics,
creating emergency medical teams in major American cities and a
``cyber corps'' of computer experts who can respond quickly to
electronic attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton gave the interview as his lawyers closed their defense
presentation at his impeachment trial in the Senate. Since the
Lewinsky scandal began a year ago Thursday, the president has given
almost no interviews to major American news organizations. With his
presidency under fire, it is unclear how much of the proposed new
money and programs Clinton will be able to sell to the
Republican-dominated Congress. But it has traditionally supported
White House efforts to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the enormous pressure, Clinton appeared relaxed,
very comfortable and deeply engaged in the complex scientific and
policy issues raised by what the White House has called 21st
century threats. He smiled repeatedly, yet spoke of spending
sleepless nights pondering the new security challenges facing
America after the end of the Cold War.

<P>
   At issue are federal court rulings that upheld the rights of 6
million Medicare beneficiaries in health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   A federal district judge in Tucson, Ariz., and the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, in San Francisco, said such patients have
a constitutional right to receive written notices and hearings on
any denial of medical services, because the HMOs were acting on
behalf of the government.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare officials are urging Donna Shalala, the secretary of
health and human services, to appeal the decision to the Supreme
Court. But other administration officials, who work on legislative
affairs and domestic policy, strenuously oppose any appeal, saying
the administration will look ridiculous and will outrage consumer
groups and Democrats in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments are set forth in confidential memorandums that
provide a rare insight into the legal and political considerations
that shape the government's decisions on litigation before the high
court. They seem to parallel the arguments made for and against a
``patient's bill of rights'' like the one proposed by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare officials argue that the lower-court orders intrude on
their ability to set Medicare policy, and go much further than
necessary to protect elderly patients. ``The appeals process
required by the district court could impose significant
administrative and financial burdens on health plans,'' raising
costs by $4.70 a person per month, or a total of $343 million a
year, said a memorandum by Medicare officials.
</P>
<P>
   Under the lower-court orders, HMOs must provide a written notice
whenever a service requested by a patient or a doctor is denied, or
a course of treatment is reduced or terminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under this standard, beneficiaries could be inundated with
written notices whenever a perceived reduction occurs,'' the
Medicare officials said. ``Such a situation would be confusing and
even stressful to beneficiaries.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, Medicare officials do not like being second-guessed by
the courts, and they resent judicial supervision just as much as
HMO executives resent federal regulation.
</P>
<P>
   But a memorandum written by other officials of the Department of
Health and Human Services emphasizes the political risks of an
appeal to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The department's position could be seen as inconsistent with
the administration's stated policy of expanding consumer
protections for health plan enrollees,'' it says. ``As a result, a
petition could weaken the department's and the administration's
ability to pass legislation that creates additional protections,
such as in the patient's bill of rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy-Ann Min DeParle, the administrator of the Health Care
Financing Administration, which runs Medicare, came down against
the lower-court decisions. She told Shalala that the administration
``should seek relief from the Supreme Court,'' even though Ms.
DeParle acknowledged that there were legal and political risks in
this approach.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, other administration officials said the rights of
Medicare HMO patients should meet constitutional standards for
``due process of law'' because the stakes were so high: if an HMO
denies coverage of a service, the patient may suffer irreparable
harm or die.
</P>
<P>
   Further, these officials said in confidential memorandums, if
the administration succeeds in its effort to overturn the court
decisions won by Medicare beneficiaries, it could undermine the
rights of poor people in Medicaid, who have increasingly been
required to get their care through HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, these officials said, ``health plans may be
exaggerating the financial and administrative burdens'' imposed by
the lower-court orders.
</P>
<P>
   The case, a nationwide class action, was filed in 1993 by
elderly people who said they had been denied medically necessary
services. The plaintiffs won a ruling from the federal district
court in Tucson in October 1996. Shalala appealed, saying the
judge, Alfredo Marquez, had usurped her authority.
</P>
<P>
   Last August the appellate court in San Francisco rejected the
administration's argument. Judge Charles Wiggins, a former
Republican congressman from California, said Medicare beneficiaries
are entitled to due process because the HMO decisions amount to
``government action.''
</P>
<P>
   HMOs are private corporations, but when they deny services to
Medicare beneficiaries they are acting on behalf of the government,
the court said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has issued rules for Medicare HMOs, but the
order by Marquez provides greater protection to beneficiaries. The
judge's order sets tighter deadlines for HMOs to rule on appeals,
and it guarantees that patients can receive urgently needed
services while they pursue appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Vicki Gottlich, a lawyer at the National Senior Citizens Law
Center, said the court order also ``goes much further than current
federal rules in requiring HMOs to explain what additional evidence
you need to support your claim, and how to get that evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   A report on the case by government lawyers says ``the worst
possible scenario'' is that Shalala will appeal to the Supreme
Court and the Justices will decline to accept the case for review.
</P>
<P>
   Lower courts would probably view such action as ``a judgment by
the Supreme Court that our arguments were unpersuasive,'' the
report said.

NEW-LOOK DAILY RACING FORM MAKES IMPACT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ When Steve Crist wrote recently about the
horse-racing industry's most significant developments of 1998, he
listed the popularity of the guaranteed pick-six, the founding of
the NTRA ``league office'' and indications the economic bleeding
has stopped. He also left out a big one.
</P>
<P>
   It must have been modesty that prevented Crist from including
the changes in the Daily Racing Form since the 105-year-old
newspaper was purchased in July by a group he led.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been unseemly for me to herald that as a major
development,'' Crist said with a laugh on the phone from New York
this week. ``I'll let someone else say that. I wouldn't disagree
with you.''
</P>
<P>
   As editor and publisher, Crist has shaken up the Form's lineup
of writers, columnists and handicappers and stirred up readers with
changes in the past-performance charts from which serious
horseplayers pick winners. Added are details on runners' pedigrees,
recent class levels and opponents, and distance and surface
specialties.
</P>
<P>
   On top of the additions to Form data inspired by Crist's
innovative but short-lived Racing Times in 1991-92, the latest
round of improvements have created past performances with much of
the data _ speed figures, turf and muddy-track statistics, and
next-out winners from ``key races'' _ that studious fans used to
have to compile themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom holds that giving that data to Form readers
deprives the sharpies of their edge and makes it harder to beat the
races. But Crist said he has no qualms about providing ``a
timesaver.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My guiding principle (is) if somebody could mark up my Racing
Form for me and save me two or three hours a day of extra work and
research, what would I want to see in there?'' said Crist, a
Harvard-educated former New York Times racing writer. ``I haven't
heard anybody say, `I wish I had to spend an extra two hours a day
doing my own homework.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there's a school of thought that the second you put
speed figures in the Racing Form, that took away a big edge or it
changed the game. But it seems to me favorites are still winning at
the same percentage they were 10 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' he added, ``the game gets tougher and you're not
getting the occasional 12-1 (odds) on a standout top figure horse
that Andy (Beyer) was getting in Florida in 1986. But as you well
know, you can give 10 handicappers the same information and they'll
come up with 10 different horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all judgment calls and subtleties and your perception of
the value of the (odds). No matter how good you make the PPs,
they're never going to produce 100 percent winners.''
</P>
<P>
   Crist's goal is to win back the readers who have turned to
expanded track programs for past-performance data, slicing the
Form's circulation among racegoers from 30 percent to 15 percent.
He hopes the launch of a Form on-line service in about two months
will expand the audience. Expanded PPs are part of the pitch.
</P>
<P>
   A Santa Anita racegoer joked last week that the next step is to
include an update on each horse's appetite. In fact, Crist said,
only one further change is planned _ a listing of each runner's
auction price.
</P>
<P>
   Some readers want more. One asked for an indication that a horse
was washy. Another wanted a symbol when a horse wears a tongue tie.
</P>
<P>
   Said Crist: ``I end up saying, `Hey, if someone thinks that's
real important, let him (do the research and) have that as his
edge.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dot's a shame: Dixie Dot Com's dominating victory in the San
Fernando Stakes on Saturday will be his last for months. The
4-year-old colt came out of the race with a hairline fracture in
his left front shin and will have surgery Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Bill Morey-trained horse missed most of 1998 with a similar
fracture in the same leg. That injury didn't require surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Dixie Dot Com would have been favored in the $500,000 Strub
Stakes on Feb. 6.
</P>
<P>
   99 days to go: Time to throw out the ceremonial first Kentucky
Derby contender of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Doneraile Court _ popular because of his Derby-winning sire
(Seattle Slew), jockey (Jerry Bailey), trainer (Nick Zito) and
owner (Michael Tabor) _ was the big loser in the Holy Bull Stakes
won by 14-1 Grits'n Hard Toast at Gulfstream Park on Saturday. He
floundered late in the 1 1/16-mile race, an early test for horses
aiming at the 1\-mile Derby on May 1.
</P>
<P>
   Vicar, fifth as the favorite, had the excuse of traffic trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Not Doneraile Court. Toss him out.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie D. countdown: Eddie Delahoussaye went winless at Santa
Anita on Thursday and is six from 6,000. He'll be the 14th jockey
to win that many races.
</P>
<P>
   Such a milestone _ let alone winning two Derbies and seven
Breeders' Cup races and making the Hall of Fame _ was far from his
mind when he started riding 31 years ago in his native Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I wanted to do was ride horses and win races. It wasn't
until (1978), when I was leading rider in the country, that I said,
`Maybe there's a little more to it than winning races,' ''
Delahoussaye said. ``I said, `All right, now we gotta go ... get
some Derby horses.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The weekend: Sunday's Santa Monica Handicap at Santa Anita, the
nation's first Grade I stakes of the year, finds Japanese $3.4
millionaire Seeking the Pearl and jockey Yutaka Take facing a solid
field of female sprinters.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-furlong race includes Belle's Flag, starting for the first
time since her California Cup Matron win; Love That Jazz, coming
off her Vernon Underwood win for the Kent Desormeaux-Neil Drysdale
team; and Stop Traffic, 0 for 3 since winning the Ballerina at
Saratoga.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BEST AND WORST &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE TOP 10
</P>
<P>
   1. Chick Hearn, Lakers TV and radio: Based on his work so far
this season. &QL; 
2. Vin Scully, Dodgers TV and radio: From an issue of ESPN The
Magazine last July on ``99 ways to live the life of the ultimate
fan,'' this one came in at No.72: ``Listen to Vin call a ballgame
on the radio. He is so smooth, so humble that he brings integrity
to, of all places, Los Angeles.'' Thanks. We think. The question
around this Hall of Famer is whether he'll be content now that
Peter O'Malley has left the building. As long as the Fox suits
leave him alone _ let him do his 100 games a year and don't push
him into doing promos for ``Ally McBeal'' _ he'll stay past his
50th season next year. Fox would be shooting itself between the
eyes if it crossed him and forced his ouster. &QL; 
3. Bob Miller, Kings TV: Starting his second quarter century with
the team, he'll have his Kings Court of Fame plaque up at the
Staples Center soon enough. &QL; 
4. Mario Impemba, Angels radio: All you could want in a baseball
play-by-play call. It's that simple. &QL; 
5. Ross Porter, Dodgers TV and radio: Can you break down that Kevin
Brown contract, please? &QL; 
6. Chris Roberts, UCLA football and basketball radio: The way he
handled analyst Billy Ray Smith on the football broadcasts brought
us new appreciation for a guy who's always had the voice but
usually sugarcoated things so much it was tough to listen without
developing a toothache. Roberts does sound like he's truly enjoying
himself during a broadcast, and that has to count. &QL; 
7. Nick Nickson, Kings radio: For the record: His call on Luc
Robitaille's 500th career goal is the only one Los Angeles heard _
the game wasn't on TV by some scheduling fluke. But, best of all,
since the team's move to KRLA we always look forward to Kings radio
broadcasts _ they pre-empt G. Gordon Liddy. &QL; 
8. Bill Macdonald, UCLA basketball TV: Over 20 billion jobs served
at Fox Sports West. And he keeps 'em all straight somehow. &QL; 
9. Rory Markas, USC basketball radio: Has finally escaped Clippers
hell. Congrats. &QL; 
10. Jamie Jarrin, Dodgers Spanish-language radio: OK, so I have no
idea what he's saying, but the guy's in the Hall of Fame for cryin'
out loud. (And you know what: He'll tell you that his English is
good enough, but he could do a game in his other language better
than some of his counterparts). &QL; 
Honorable mention: Jim Watson, Fox Sports West 2 high school
football and basketball; Al Epstein, Pepperdine basketball radio;
Lou Riggs, UCLA volleyball radio; Steve Physioc, Angels TV (sure,
but can he handle Rex Hudler?); Rick DeReyes, Jethawks radio (the
dream job continues); Fernando Gonzalez, Lakers Spanish-language
radio (although he's never confused Travis Knight for Travis Grant,
he often drops the ``H'' in Robert Horry). &QL; 
THE BOTTOM FIVE &QL; 
1. Ralph Lawler, Clippers TV: Based on his work so far this season.
(And by the way: It continues to astound us that his two catch
phrases _ ``Bingo!'' and ``Fasten your seat belts!'' _ are used to
describe a Clippers game that are actually in progress. If Lawler
had only two catch phrases, you'd think they'd be something like:
``Clippers take another 20,'' or ``We'll get 'em next time!'') &QL; 
2. Rick Monday, Dodgers radio: Don't take our word for it. In the
New Times' 1998 Guide to the Best of Los Angeles last summer,
Monday was voted ``Best Reason for the Dodgers to Change
Announcers.'' Their review: ``His basso-buffoondo delivery has been
bad enough for far too long.... the water-torture quality of
Monday's broadcasts (is) a collection of obtuse non-sequiturs,
moldy platitudes and insipid observations delivered with that kind
of former ballplayer's overconfidence that comes from signing too
many autographs and using too much hair spray.'' Bingo! &QL; 
3. Chris Madsen, Ducks TV: Mute, please. And a little Velcro for
the 'do. &QL; 
4. Lee Hamilton, USC football radio: He's no Milo Hamilton, but
there's always the option to change his name to that if he wanted.
At least ``Hacksaw'' (his real nickname) didn't use the phrase
``dammit'' during the Trojans' loss in the Sun Bowl. &QL; 
5. Tom Kelly, USC football and basketball TV: It's been said he's
such a pro he could do a game in his sleep. And he often does. &QL; 
Horrible mention: Brian Hamilton, Ducks radio; Brian Barnhart,
Angels radio (great first-year pipes, but he sounds more like he
should steer toward a career as a public address announcer). &QL;

BANKBOSTON CORP. EARNINGS OFF 12 PERCENT IN PERIOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ BankBoston Corp., hit by lingering trouble in volatile
world markets, reported a 12 percent decline in fourth-quarter
earnings Thursday but a rosier outlook for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   New England's second largest bank cited higher-than-usual
contributions to loan-loss reserves, loan writedowns, and increased
expenses, all of which offset gains in its capital markets and
Latin America work.
</P>
<P>
   Despite new economic and financial troubles in Brazil, the
bank's core overseas market, BankBoston said the high-end focus of
its Latin American operations provided a cushion should Brazil's
situation worsen this year.
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth quarter, net income fell to $207 million from
$235 million the previous year. Earnings per share dropped 10
percent to $0.70 from $0.78. The figures were a major improvement
on the third quarter, when net income plunged 54 percent on wobbly
markets.
</P>
<P>
   The results, in line with forecasts from analysts surveyed by
First Call Corp., reflected the company's unusual profile as a
regional bank with both international and investment banking units.
About 20 percent of BankBoston's revenue comes from Latin America,
50 percent from domestic corporate banking, 10 percent from
traditional banking at home, and the remainder from a hodgepodge of
businesses, including private banking.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston, the nation's 15th-largest bank, achieved record
earnings last year from its expanding South American retail and
commercial banking. The bank has dollar-based revenues but
Brazilian real-based expenses _ a plus if the region has a
downturn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're feeling very good about our Brazilian operations,'' said
BankBoston chief financial officer Susannah Swihart.
</P>
<P>
   But analyst Gerard Cassidy of Tucker Anthony Inc. said it was
questionable whether the bank could maintain its revenue growth
there if Brazil's economy continues its slide.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston spent heavily to acquire investment bank Robertson
Stephens last year only months before a downturn in global capital
markets. While the unit's business was strong last quarter, its
profits were dampened by spending on retention payments to key
executives.
</P>
<P>
   All those factors help push 1998 net income down to $792 million
from $879 million in 1997, a drop of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston shares slipped 1 1/8 to close at 38 3/4 on the New
York Stock Exchange.

FLOOD OF TRANSACTIONS MARK OPENING OF NBA ACTIVITY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Karl Malone and Charles Barkley are staying put, Latrell
Sprewell and Scottie Pippen have moved on to New York and Houston,
respectively, and Dennis Rodman still has no idea where he will end
up.
</P>
<P>
   On what may be remembered as the most chaotic day in modern NBA
history, a flurry of transactions flooded the league's offices as
teams scrambled to fill out their rosters in the lockout-shortened
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we've ever seen a day like this, where
everything is happening at once,'' said Ernie Grunfeld, the New
York Knicks team president and general manger.
</P>
<P>
   The lockout was officially lifted at 2 p.m. Eastern time
Thursday, as many teams opened training camp with half-full rosters
and awaited players whom they had acquired in deals that had not
yet been approved by the league.
</P>
<P>
   With the first preseason game scheduled for Sunday, gauging who
the emerging powers in the league might be over a 50-game season
beginning Feb. 5 and ending May 5 became increasingly difficult,
although it was clear that many franchise players had decided to
stay with their current teams rather than bolt.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the complete schedule for the season was released,
and that definitely shed some light on the season. For one thing,
teams will be forced to play games on three consecutive nights for
the first time in a decade. And the schedule will be grueling in
other ways, too: The Knicks will have to play seven games in nine
nights in a period extending from March 14-22 and the Los Angeles
Lakers have a stretch in which they play five games in six nights,
four of them on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks took part in the day's most talked-about trade,
acquiring the controversial Sprewell from Golden State for John
Starks, Chris Mills and Terry Cummings.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the day's other developments included the following:
</P>
<P>
   _ Charles Barkley, speaking from the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic
in La Quinta, Calif., has apparently decided to re-sign with the
Houston Rockets and join Scottie Pippen and Hakeem Olajuwon on the
league's most star-studded frontline.
</P>
<P>
   _ Karl Malone met with Utah Jazz owner Larry Miller, and has
decided to remain in Utah after saying, last summer, that he would
never play for the Jazz again.
</P>
<P>
   _ Damon Stoudamire agreed to re-sign with the Blazers for $81
million over seven years, making him the highest-paid point guard
in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   _ Antoine Walker has apparently agreed to a six-year, $71
million contract extension with the Boston Celtics. Walker, in the
final year of his three-year rookie contract, will team with 6-foot
11-inch Tony Battie, who was acquired from the Los Angeles Lakers
for center Travis Knight.
</P>
<P>
   _ Having lost Antonio McDyess to the Denver Nuggets, the Phoenix
Suns are apparently close to a deal with Minnesota free agent Tom
Gugliotta. Phoenix renounced 10 free agents, including McDyess,
Thursday in the first step to clear the salary cap room needed to
sign Gugliotta. The Suns also were expected to trade three players
to Chicago for Luc Longley.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Charlotte Hornets wasted no time in adding Derrick
Coleman, announcing the signing of the free agent power forward
just minutes after the official opening of training camp. Coleman
received $40 million over five seasons. But Vlade Divac and Matt
Geiger did not re-sign with the club. Divac apparently is headed to
the Sacramento Kings and Geiger signed with Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   _ Miami Heat shooting guard Voshon Lenard was found to have a
stress fracture in his left leg. He is expected to undergo surgery
and be out 8-10 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rodman's agent, Dwight Manley, said Thursday that
Rodman won't sign with any club before next week. Instead, he will
appear on ``The Tonight Show'' in Los Angeles Friday night, when he
is expected to hint at which teams he would be interested in
joining.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman's former team, the defending champion Chicago Bulls, have
yet to get off the ground in the post-Michael Jordan era. They had
only six players under contract by a mid-afternoon practice _ Ron
Harper, Toni Kukoc, Randy Brown, Curtis Staples, Keith Booth and
newly re-signed Bill Wennington _ and the new coach, Tim Floyd,
eventually gave up and called the practice off.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was very tough,'' said Harper in the understatement of
the day.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls will open the season on Feb. 5 in a championship
rematch with the Utah Jazz. The game will not be nationally
televised.

MISSILE PLAN CREATES U.S.-CHINA QUANDARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MISSILE-RUSSIA) 
(lb) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Having planned a major outlay for defensive
missiles, the Clinton administration now faces a major diplomatic
and military quandary with China. The sensitivities are so acute
that the Clinton administration has twice delayed sending Congress
a classified report on a proposed missile system to defend Japan,
South Korea and Taiwan, and the U.S. troops stationed in the
region, officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Anxieties arose when North Korea fired a ballistic missile over
Japan and into the Pacific Ocean on Aug. 31. They are behind
general U.S. plans to develop and test a limited national system of
missile defense, at a proposed cost of $10.5 billion over six
years.
</P>
<P>
   The development may also involve the renegotiation of agreements
with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   During a tour of Japan this month, Defense Secretary William
Cohen met with top Japanese officials to discuss a joint venture to
develop regional missile defenses. Immediately, the Chinese accused
the United States of trying to start ``a revival of Japan's
military ambitions.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, in Washington ``They've gone over the draft several
times,'' said one administration official who has seen the
documents. ``No one wants China to be offended.''
</P>
<P>
   After the North Korean missile firing, Japanese public opinion
shifted nearly overnight toward supporting such a system and the
Japanese Parliament approved joint research with the United States
after years of quietly fending off U.S. proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The launching of the North Korean missile with its greatly
increased range also raised alarm in Congress and the Clinton
administration. The 37,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea and
nearly 50,000 others serving in Japan appeared far more vulnerable,
officials said, to the improved North Korea missile system.
</P>
<P>
   Since North Korea remains dependent on China, the administration
immediately asked the Chinese to persuade Pyongyang to demonstrate
that it would stop firing missiles over Japan, but to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   China is directly at issue in the question of defending Taiwan,
which is threatened only by Chinese missiles. Since the early 1990s
China has more or less doubled, to several hundred, the number of
missiles on the coast facing Taiwan. And any system protecting
Taiwan would have to be crafted to neutralize those Chinese
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   That creates a double blow, in the Chinese view, that makes any
proposed system look like an offensive weapon aimed at Beijing and
not a shield against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest ironies of this debate is that it was
China's client _ North Korea _ that brought this debate into full
daylight and that is causing such problems for China,'' said
Richard Armitage, a former Defense Department official.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans in Congress agree. By mandating the
report last year, Congress asked the administration to describe,
however vaguely, what a system would look like.
</P>
<P>
   The missile defense plan is expensive and as yet unproved; it
will be years before such a system could be ready, which is one of
the arguments the administration is making to the Chinese to calm
their fears.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But while administration officials continue to debate how to
sell the idea to China, there is little doubt that the research
will go ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a question of whether we will do this,'' said Joseph
Nye, former assistant secretary of defense in the first Clinton
administration and now dean of the Kennedy School of Government at
Harvard University. ``It will go ahead. The question is how we do
it. What is open for discussion is the fine print about it. The
Chinese should not overreact.''
</P>
<P>
   To critics who question why the United States is pushing ahead
with a system that could add to the fraught relations between
Washington and Beijing, congressional aides answer that the issue
is North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan has yet to decide whether to join with the United States
in the system. Taiwan already has Patriot missiles, and the price
tag for undertaking the new missile defense research is high. The
Japanese Defense Agency is expected to spend up to $260 million for
its five- to six-year research project.
</P>
<P>
   The administration plans to meet its latest deadline, after
receiving two extensions, and give the classified report to
Congress next week.

DESPITE AUSTERITY MEASURES, BRAZIL MARKETS DIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ A day after Congress approved austerity
measures perceived by investors as a crucial test of the country's
commitment to reduce systematic overspending, its currency and
stock market fell, and fears mounted that Brazil was running low on
dollars to pay for debts, imports and other expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Since Brazil devalued its currency on Friday, saying that it
would no longer spend upward of $1 billion a day to protect the
real, an average of $300 million a day has reportedly continued to
leave for other countries.
</P>
<P>
   As of 8:30 p.m. Thursday, $290 million had left during the day.
Since September foreign reserves have fallen, from $75 billion to
less than $30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Bovespa share index fell 4.59 percent Thursday, and the
value of the real closed 1.70 to the dollar at the commercial rate,
a drop of 7 percent under the Wednesday close of 1.59. Since Jan.
12 the real has fallen 28 percent from its initial level of 1.21 to
the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dealing with a very uncertain scenario now,'' said Joel
Korn, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Rio de
Janeiro. ``We have too many questions and very few answers,
really.''
</P>
<P>
   The falling currency and increasing interest rates have raised
questions over whether Brazil might seek a moratorium on
rescheduling its debt payments.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts said they did not believe that a moratorium was
inevitable, but it could not be ruled out. The Group of Seven
industrial nations, the United States and the International
Monetary Fund are leading a $41.5 billion bailout to help Brazil
weather its worst crisis since President Fernando Henrique Cardoso
took office four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Paulo Rabello de Castro, chairman of SR Rating-Duss &AMP; Phelps,
said the government ``has all the political incentives to not even
consider the `M word.'''
</P>
<P>
   While nobody here is saying Cardoso's victory on Wednesday in
Congress on revising the deficit-ridden social security system was
too late, economists are contending that the government's actions
to cut costs will have to be far more dramatic than anything rolled
out so far.
</P>
<P>
   The government budget deficit, before devaluation, was a
galloping 8 percent of the gross national product, or $65 billion,
much of it aggravated by high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Despite speculation that Brazil might lower interest rates
because of the devaluation, it has raised them, with IMF support.
</P>
<P>
   The high interest rates are a counterweight to inflation, which
has for most of the last 40 years moved at stratospheric levels.
But high rates, while keeping money out of the private sector, are
fueling higher debt costs for the government.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that could not last for long.
</P>
<P>
   ``The service of the debt is overwhelming now,'' Castro said.
``So unless the government does what it has to do quickly, it could
reach the point of no return. The fundamental that's missing is a
real attack on the real public-sector debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts here say they are convinced that Brazil faces a tougher
task to rebuild the confidence of foreign investors, who are most
unlikely to start putting money back into Brazil on the strength of
signals like the Wednesday night vote alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can say in good conscience what's going to happen in
inflation or to the exchange or the level of economic activity in
the country,'' Castro said. ``All along investors have been
motivated to invest in Brazil based on the monetary stability, low
inflation, transparency and the way they could see a clear
direction. And now everybody's kind of up in the air, because the
exchange-rate change changed the whole equation.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Martin Arranz of Banco Patente said, ``The important point for
rebuilding the internal market will be to see dollars coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   Mentioning a series of congressional votes on extending and
increasing a tax on financial transactions, Arranz said: ``Nobody
wants to bet on whether it will pass. They'll wait until it does
pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Arranz estimated that Brazil would need $50 billion to finance
payments on Eurobonds, tourist spending and interest and service on
Brady bonds. He said he expected $15 billion in direct investments
to enter Brazil and $3 billion in import payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``So there will be $22 billion that Brazil will need to receive
through other forms of investment,'' Arranz added.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Central Bank is no longer intervening in currency
trading to buy reals, it has not been clear how much of the money
leaving Brazil is going out from the Central Bank coffers and how
much might be dollars that banks here bought at cheaper levels and
are now sending out of the country.

EUGENE PULLIAM, 84, INDIANA PUBLISHER WHO OPPOSED McCARTHY   By ERIC PACE 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eugene S. Pulliam, publisher of The Indianapolis Star and The
Indianapolis News, a champion of the First Amendment who signed a
declaration that said Sen. Joseph McCarthy's methods threatened
press freedom and American freedom, died on Wednesday in
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   He was 84 and lived in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Pulliam had been ill for most of 1998 but continued to have a
voice in the two newspapers' operations by telephone, the executive
editor of the papers, Frank Caperton, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Pulliam became publisher of The Star and The News in 1975 after
the death of his father, Eugene C. Pulliam, who had held those
posts.
</P>
<P>
   In a widely quoted interview in 1991, Pulliam declared, ``I
think newspapers will continue to be the only sizable check on
government.''
</P>
<P>
   His devotion to press freedom spanned the more than six decades
of his career in journalism and was especially notable in the
McCarthy era, during which he was the managing editor of The
Indianapolis News. In the early 1950s, he strongly criticized what
he called the smear tactics of McCarthy, a Wisconsin Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Pulliam was a member of an 11-member special committee of the
American Society of Newspaper Editors, which studied McCarthy's
questioning of James A. Wechsler, editor of The New York Post, at
closed Senate hearings on April 24 and May 5, 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Basil Walters, president of the society, appointed the committee
to determine whether McCarthy had used his Senate Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations in an effort to intimidate Wechsler
while ostensibly investigating Communist activities in the United
States. The Post had been critical of McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   Walters announced on Aug. 12 in Washington that the committee's
members had been unable to agree whether freedom of the press had
been threatened in McCarthy's questioning of Wechsler. Walters did
not disclose the numerical divisions on the committee, but Pulliam
and three other members filed an additional report that said
McCarthy's methods were not only a threat to freedom of the press
but also ``a peril to American freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   The other committee members who signed that report were J.R.
Wiggins, managing editor of The Washington Post; Herbert Brucker,
editor of The Hartford Courant; and William M. Tugman, editor of
The Register-Guard in Eugene, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Later that day McCarthy was asked in New York about the four
editors' strong _ and, at the time, daring _ criticism of his
methods. He replied: ``When you dig out a crooked lawyer, other
lawyers do not say you are impairing the freedom of the legal
profession. When you dig out a dishonest banker, other bankers
don't plead injury. It seems rather ridiculous to me that there are
claims of infringement of freedom of the press whenever you attempt
to dig out crooks or Communists in that profession.''
</P>
<P>
   Pulliam was also capable of voicing criticism of journalists.
After Dan Quayle, his nephew, was elected vice president in 1988,
Pulliam contended that the press had been guilty of ``unfair and
inaccurate reporting'' during the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Atchison, Kan., Eugene Smith Pulliam was the son of
Myrta Smith Pulliam and of Eugene Collins Pulliam, the proprietor
of The Atchison Champion newspaper. The elder Pulliam went on to
own more than four dozen newspapers around the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It was after the elder Pulliam bought The Evening Star, in
Franklin, Ind., that the Pulliam family moved to Indiana. There the
younger Eugene Pulliam began his career in journalism, as a
newspaper delivery boy. He received a bachelor's degree in 1935
from DePauw University, worked for what was then the United Press
and in radio, served in the Navy in World War II and became
aviation editor of The Indianapolis Star.
</P>
<P>
   He rose from there through the ranks of his father's newspaper
empire, becoming also the executive vice president of Central
Newspapers Inc., the parent company of the Pulliam newspaper group.
He still held that post at his death.
</P>
<P>
   He was also prominent in newspaper industry organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Pulliam is survived by his wife, the former Jane Bleecker, whom
he married in 1943; two daughters, Myrta J. Pulliam of
Indianapolis, who is director of electronic news and information at
Indianapolis Newspapers, and Deborah S. Pulliam of Castine, Maine,
a free-lance writer; a son, Russell B., of Indianapolis, who is
editor of The News; and six grandchildren.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    The year was 1965, the time of my personal introduction to
Martin Luther King and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference
and my baptism into the civil rights movement.
 &HT;    Dozens of nightstick-wielding state troopers, deployed by
Alabama Gov. George Wallace, stood at the end of the Edmund Pettus
Bridge on the outskirts of Selma. I was a 19-year-old junior
attending Wiley College in Marshall, Texas. A group of my
schoolmates and I had taken time out of school and had come to
Selma to help initiate a voter registration campaign and, of
course, to hear Dr. King speak at Brown's Chapel Methodist Church.
 &HT;    Fear, the stuff of black life in the South during those days,
had always been my constant companion. But when the nearly 300 of
us, led by King, Ralph Abernathy and Andy Young, descended the hump
of the bridge, I wanted to turn and run. The helmeted troopers,
white men full of hatred and false courage, were determined to halt
our march.
 &HT;    A fat trooper, standing behind a waist-high patch of grass,
stared into my eyes. He understood my fear. Sensing his need to
brutalize us, I was convinced that my life would end that day on
the dusty easement of the Edmund Pettus.
 &HT;    Because I was near the end of the wave of protesters, I could
not see King and the other leaders of the march. Looking into the
faces of the other marchers, I saw fear and anticipation. I was
surprised to see that about half of them were old people _ women
and men whose wrinkles and scars and slow gait chronicled the
South's legacy of inhumanity. The presence of these elders made me
hopeful and ashamed that I had waited so long to join the movement.
 &HT;    In front of me, a mass of bodies surged forward, heads bobbing
rhythmically, and words to the song We Shall Overcome echoed in the
warm air. Suddenly, a voice, amplified over a bullhorn, yelled,
``Turn back and go home.''
 &HT;    We moved forward.
 &HT;    ``Disperse! Turn back!''
 &HT;    Frightened white journalists mustered the strength of mind to
stay alongside us as we marched toward the courthouse, where we
were to let the world know that black people in the South had a
right to vote.
 &HT;    ``Niggers!'' another voice, somewhere beyond the first row of
troopers, shouted.
 &HT;    ``Turn back!'' a trooper said.
 &HT;    We refused.
 &HT;    The marchers in front of me no longer moved as a single body. We
became individuals, pushed by the realization that we would be
attacked by white men who wanted to obliterate us.
 &HT;    The words ``god--- niggers'' came from the crowd of white
counterdemonstrators gathering behind the troopers.
 &HT;    Then, the screaming began.
 &HT;    Our women were the first to run as the troopers attacked, their
nightsticks coming down like rain. For the first time in my life, I
heard human bones crack. An old woman next to me fell to the
pavement after a trooper backhanded her across the chest. Falling,
she struggled to hold her green and orange gingham dress over her
legs.
 &HT;    The trooper's next move shocked even me, a kid born and reared
in a South Florida ghetto, who had seen violent incidents nearly
every day. He kicked the woman in the stomach. As the crowd pulled
me forward, I lost sight of her and never saw her again.
 &HT;    When tear gas canisters hit the bridge and a poisonous cloud
rose into the air, the troopers, all wearing masks, rushed us and
knocked many of us down. No one of us fought back. March organizers
had taught us that we would be whipped, injured, jailed and perhaps
even killed. The clubbing seemingly went on for an hour or longer
as sheriff's deputies joined the troopers and encircled us.
 &HT;    The gas was overpowering, burning our lungs and eyes and
nostrils. Most of us, at least those still standing, simply wanted
to get out of the line of fire. By now, however, the cops had
smelled blood _ a lot of blood flowed that day known as ``Bloody
Sunday'' _ and were singling out younger males to chase and beat.
 &HT;    I was one of the unlucky ones.
 &HT;    A deputy struck me in the neck from behind with his nightstick,
and, when I turned to face him, he jabbed me in the solar plexus
with the weapon. My college roommate was beside me. He was hit in
the face, and I saw blood stream down his cheek.
 &HT;    I could see King and Abernathy. Several deputies were dragging
them toward a squad car. Young stood near an officer in charge,
pointing at other officers beating three girls. Again, I was hit,
this time on the forehead. Tasting my own blood, I raised my arms
to ward off the blows. Women were screaming and children were
crying. But the cops continued to pound us.
 &HT;    That night at the church, I took full measure of what had
transpired. We out-of-towners had far less to lose than the local
black residents who participated in the demonstration. They stood
to lose everything _ their jobs, their churches, their homes. And,
yet, they had the courage to stand with King on the side of
justice.
 &HT;    Indeed, King deserves praise for making the civil rights
movement a matter of conscience. But another remarkable side of the
movement is rarely mentioned: That story is the bravery of the
thousands of old people throughout the South who willingly faced
the gas, the dogs, the truncheons, the guns. King knew how
important these old folk were, for he routinely praised them in
speech and in deed.
 &HT;    Martin Luther King has been dead since 1968, but I, along with
others who had the honor of knowing him, remain touched by his
courage and dedication to the cause of justice. He brought out the
best in us. He taught us to overcome fear, to overcome hatred and
to turn the evil of the oppressor into a positive force in our
lives.

transpired. We out-of-towners had far less to lose than the local
black residents who participated in the demonstration. They stood
to lose everything _ their jobs, their churches, their homes. And,
yet, they had the courage to stand with King on the side of
justice.
 &HT;    Indeed, King deserves praise for making the civil rights
movement a matter of conscience. But another remarkable side of the
movement is rarely mentioned: That story is the bravery of the
thousands of old people throughout the South who willingly faced
the gas, the dogs, the truncheons, the guns. King knew how
important these old folk were, for he routinely praised them in
speech and in deed.
 &HT;    Martin Luther King has been dead since 1968, but I, along with
others who had the honor of knowing him, remain touched by his
courage and dedication to the cause of justice. He brought out the
best in us. He taught us to overcome fear, to overcome hatred and
to turn the evil of the oppressor into a positive force in our
lives.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    The Big Lie is tossed about by America's most grievous liars
every day, in newspapers, talk shows, on television and on the
Internet. The Big Lie has various components but encompasses two
themes: Illegal immigrants and legal immigrants. The opponents of
illegals are almost always the opponents of legals. These people
are wrong, and the lie begins here, for the truth is no friend of
theirs.
 &HT;    Lie No. 1: Due to a tidal wave of immigration, the United States
will have a population of 500 million in 50 years. Truth: The
Census Bureau projects 395 million people in the United States in
the year 2050, about 125 million more than now.
 &HT;    Lie No. 2: American cities will choke if more immigrants are
allowed into the United States. Truth: Most large American cities
have actually lost population in recent years as Americans have
moved to the suburbs. Nonetheless, many new immigrants move into
those same cities, abandoned by others, which are complete with
streets, schools, sewers and other paid for infrastructure.
 &HT;    Lie No. 3: Pollution will increase because of invading
immigrants. Truth: The air in immigrant-rich Los Angeles is
hundreds of times cleaner today than 30 to 40 years ago despite the
fact that Los Angeles has doubled in size and experienced
exponential growth in numbers of automobiles and industry since the
1950s and '60s.
 &HT;    Lie No. 4: Schools are dumbed down to accommodate immigrant
children. Truth: Test scores are lower in all parts of the country
than they were two generations ago, even in areas where there are
few immigrants. In 1950, fewer than 10 percent of Mexican-origin
children graduated from high school; the Census of 2000 will show
that almost 60 percent of them graduate now. In 1950, fewer than a
dozen Mexican-origin graduate students earned doctorates in
American universities; this last year 1,000 Mexican and other
Hispanics earned doctorates. Recent studies conclude that immigrant
children and children of immigrants do better in school than
native-born children.
 &HT;    Lie No. 5: Immigrants keep wages low by their very presence and
work for low wages to the detriment of others. Truth: The United
States has always been a cheap labor economy. Why should it be any
different now? Immigrants do usually take low wage jobs and they do
so for many reasons, among which are: Language, cultural
differences, lack off hi-tech skills, real desire to work, and
availability of low-skill work. Someone must do this kind of work,
if not immigrants, who?
 &HT;    Lie No. 6:Immigrants, legal and illegal, are ripping off the
welfare system. Truth: Illegal aliens are not eligible for public
benefits of most kinds, except health, and have never been. Studies
show that legal immigrants do not draw public benefits to the
extent that native-born citizens do, bona-fide disabled refugees
excepted. There is not a single official study that proves
otherwise.
 &HT;    Lie No. 7: Taxpayers are being drained of their lifeblood to
support immigrant children, legal and illegal, in school. Truth:
Two-thirds of immigrants are over 18, thus have finished most of
their schooling. Assuming, then, that we do not have to spend in
excess of $5,000 per immigrant for schooling per year, or $60,000
for 12 years of school, the country is infused with billions of
dollars worth of educated people without spending a dime on them.
In other words, other countries, some poorer than the Unites
States, provide us with a huge transfer of their wealth and so,
directly subsidize the people of the United States. Moreover, these
immigrants contribute taxes and Social Security immediately.
 &HT;    Lie No. 8: We are bombarded with rhetoric about ``400,000
illegal alien children in California schools and the
$2-billion-a-year cost to educate them.'' Truth: The number of such
children in California schools and costs associated with them are
exaggerated and misstated. Nonetheless, the costs are paid for,
abundantly so, with taxes illegals pay. These taxes include state
income taxes, property taxes if they own their homes or indirectly
through rent, sales taxes that are collected when they buy a soft
drink or a car, or even the monies they pay through the lottery.
 &HT;    The truth is, without young immigrants, the United States will
fall victim to old age. It will wither and die as may Japan,
Germany and most European countries by the year 2050. The median
age in the nation is 35 and growing older by the day, despite
immigration. This portends disaster, a great American disaster.
 &HT;    The purveyors of the The Big Lie ignore these facts. They have
to because the truth is no friend of theirs.

Indian Country Today. His Indian name is Nanwica Kciji.) 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Only the uninformed would believe the unemployment statistics
released by state governments in South Dakota, Arizona, Montana,
New Mexico, North Dakota and in other places with large Indian
populations.
 &HT;    More often than not, unemployment figures on the Indian
reservations within the boundaries of most states are not included.
For instance, if the unemployment rate in South Dakota is listed at
4 percent, you can bet that it would rise to about 10 percent if
all of the unemployed on reservations were included.
 &HT;    This failure to report the unemployed on Indian lands creates a
very distorted perception of a state's economic condition. The
bean-counters in Washington, D.C., use these figures when
distributing dollars to depressed areas. I have pointed out this
oversight time and again in my columns over the years.
 &HT;    On large reservations, such as the Pine Ridge and Rosebud
Reservations in South Dakota (combined populations of more than
30,000), and in the Navajo Nation of Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado
and Utah (population of more than 200,000), unemployment is as high
as 50 to 70 percent. The Navajo do not own gaming casinos and those
on the Pine Ridge and Rosebud reservations are located in a vast
region with a very small population.
 &HT;    The Prairie Wind Casino on the Pine Ridge Reservation provides
about 200 full-time jobs. Compared to a casino on an Indian
reservation in Minnesota that employs more than 4,000, the number
of jobs provided at Pine Ridge is minuscule.
 &HT;    Just think: Suppose the city of Detroit had an unemployment
ratio of say 60 percent. It would be considered a national disaster
area. Granted, the unemployment in Detroit is probably higher than
in most major American cities, but it does not come anywhere near
60 percent.
 &HT;    History has made it clear that neither the states nor federal
government (nor tribal governments, for that matter) have found a
way to reduce the unemployment on the Navajo, Pine Ridge or Rosebud
reservations. Costly program after costly program has failed
because there has never been any long-range planning and the
Band-Aid approach to treating a major wound has proven ineffective.
 &HT;    I suggested one possible cure a few years back: that successful
Indian casino owners provide jobs to tribes with high unemployment.
But perhaps the suggestion was premature. At the time, there were
not too many tribes in a position to pursue this idea. Casinos were
new to them and they were in the process of building, growing and
hiring. Consequently, most employees working in these major,
revenue-producing casinos are non-Indians. Just visit any of the
casinos in the eastern part of America and you will find yourself
asking, ``Where are the Indians?''
 &HT;    But today, this idea can perhaps be put on the table once more.
Indian nations with lucrative gaming ventures could also build
dormitories or low-income housing on their lands and hire Indians
from tribes with extremely high unemployment to staff some of the
many job positions offered by their business ventures.
 &HT;    In the 1960s, the motto of many Indian businesses and programs
was ``Indians helping Indians.'' That message appears to have been
lost in the 1990s as the gap between the `haves' and the `have
nots' has continued to grow. If we keep in mind that 90 percent of
the income derived by gaming establishments on Indian reservations
is earned by only 5 percent of the Indian tribes, it puts it into
perspective. The rich may get richer, but the poor are still poor.
 &HT;    Thousands of unemployed Indians would gladly relocate to
Minnesota, New York or Arizona (and other states) to fill the job
positions offered by the Indian nations operating successful
casinos or other businesses. Intelligent, trainable Indians are
just waiting for an opportunity. There are plenty of mechanics,
electricians, plumbers, carpenters, convenience store managers,
teachers, historians and many, many more skilled citizens of Indian
nations available to fill job vacancies.
 &HT;    Relocation was a bad word in the 1950s because it was forced,
but its meaning can be changed completely when it is done
voluntarily.
 &HT;    But the scarcity of adequate low-cost housing is one of the
major problems faced by reservation Indians moving to urban
centers. Tribal leaders from the more successful nations should
visit the Navajo Nation and the Pine Ridge and Rosebud reservations
and see, first hand, the poverty that exists there. Many Third
World countries are in better shape.
 &HT;    ``Indians helping Indians'' should be the motto of the new
millennium, now that there are so many financially successful
Indian nations.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    I'm confused ... I mean, don't get me wrong, I greatly admired
the man, but a Malcolm X postage stamp was the farthest concept
from my mind. I'm sure from his, too.
 &HT;    The formerly described ``angriest black man in America'' is now
depicted on a stamp. Malcolm was hardly well thought of by the U.S.
government during his life. As a critic of capitalism and a
proponent of socialism, he wasn't exactly a model of what the
government wanted of its citizenry.
 &HT;    Even in 1965, the year of his death, Malcolm specifically
denounced U.S. policies in the Congo, Cuba, and Vietnam. He was
also allied with Fidel Castro, Che Guevara and Patrice Lumumba, all
political enemies of the U.S. government. He was in support of the
Vietnamese battling our troops in their country and advocated the
removal of all U.S. troops in Vietnam.
 &HT;    The stamp will appear in the Postal Service's Black Heritage
Series. The series started in 1978 to commemorate the individual
achievements of African-Americans. The Malcolm X stamp is the 22nd
stamp in the series.
 &HT;    Some think that Malcolm X on a stamp serves to further dilute
his message _ a co-opting of him. Malcolm has long been popular as
an image with those who would copy his hair cut, style of dress,
and glasses. And with the publicity and release of the Spike Lee
movie and shameless, Malcolm X clothing, hats, and other
promotional items, there was certainly further dilution of the man
from his message. Clearly the majority of people wearing the
paraphernalia probably had never heard of Malcolm beyond the fact
that he was yet another black man assassinated in America, and
there was a movie and now video out about him.
 &HT;    Despite the well documented change after his pilgrimage to
Mecca, Malcolm was still a revolutionary, a leftist. He was still
opposed to many of the policies of the U.S. government, even at his
death. That's why a stamp commemorating him is so surprising to me.
 &HT;    A government which extolls Christianity is honoring a man who
was not Christian; a man who acknowledged that his birth name was
not his real name (that had been obliterated through slavery). The
stamp features the name Malcolm used at the end of his life,
El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz _ although there is a controversy about
that, too. Some say the correct name after a pilgrimage to Mecca
begins with an ``A'' not an ``E'' Al-Haj and Al-Shabazz, not El-Haj
and El-Shabazz.
 &HT;    Here's hoping the stamp will spark interest and further study of
the man and his ideologies. Forget the movie and the promotional
publicity issued by the U.S. Postal Service. Read his words and
speeches. Malcolm X was an extraordinary man who should be honored.
But his truth should be honored. Not a shallow version watered down
over the last 30 years.
 &HT;    At least a photograph was used on the stamp instead of an
artist's depiction.
 &HT;    Can a Malcolm X holiday be far behind?

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Even when she had to go 20 extra holes to win the U.S. Women's
Open, Se Ri Pak had a way of making golf look easy _ smooth swing,
remarkable patience and unwavering concentration.
 &HT;    If only the rest of her life were that simple. The past six
weeks have offered a glimpse of how the brightest star in women's
golf since Nancy Lopez ultimately may not have enough space _ not
to mention freedom _ for her potential to blossom.
 &HT;    During the LPGA Tour Championship in Las Vegas, the then
20-year-old rookie hit balls for Butch Harmon and played nine holes
with his most important client, Tiger Woods. Shortly thereafter,
reports surfaced that Pak would leave swing coach David Leadbetter
at the end of the year to join Harmon's stable. Leadbetter
originally said the rumors were blown out of proportion, but 10
days later, he quit.
 &HT;    ``You never know where you stand,'' Leadbetter told The
Associated Press from his golf academy in Orlando, Fla. ``It's on
again, off again, on again, off again.''
 &HT;    Leadbetter was hired in December 1996 by Samsung, the Korean
electronics giant and Pak's sponsor, which wanted to help turn Pak
into one of the world's best women players.
 &HT;    The results came quickly.
 &HT;    She tied for first in the LPGA qualifying tournament, then
turned in a rookie season that took women's golf to the front
pages. Pak won the LPGA Championship in May, then became the
youngest winner of the U.S. Women's Open a month later.
 &HT;    She won twice more, setting an LPGA scoring record at the Jamie
Farr Kroger Classic, and rallied to beat Dottie Pepper down the
stretch in the Giant Eagle LPGA Classic two weeks later.
 &HT;    Pak finished the year second to Annika Sorenstam in money and
player of the year points. In voting by the Golf Writers
Association of America, Pak was selected LPGA player of the year.
 &HT;    ``While Se Ri has enjoyed a fantastic year on the LPGA Tour, she
apparently is not satisfied,'' Leadbetter commented. ``I sincerely
hope for Se Ri's sake that she finds the help she is looking for,
not only for her golf game, but to help her balance her life.''
 &HT;    Leadbetter added that it was difficult working with an athlete
who was controlled by so many interests _ Samsung, her father and
agents hired by Samsung and the family.
 &HT;    Samsung, meanwhile, recently gave up management of the star
golfer and is currently talking with International Management Group
and three other undisclosed companies to take over the reins.
 &HT;    Pak signed a 10-year exclusive managerial and sponsorship deal
with Samsung in 1996 that pays her about $1 million a year and
unspecified performance bonuses.
 &HT;    Company spokesman Kim Il-keun announced that Samsung would give
up its management role next year and allow Pak to negotiate deals
with golf equipment makers and other companies that do not compete
directly with them. ``Everybody wants a piece of her,'' Leadbetter
said. ``She doesn't have a life, basically. You can see over the
last few months. She used to smile and laugh, but she's been
miserable. How can you be miserable after the year she's had?
 &HT;    ``She's definitely the most talented woman I've ever seen and
the most talented woman I've had the opportunity to work with,'' he
said. ``But she's headed for a fall.''
 &HT;    In October, Pak's popularity and success drove her to the point
of exhaustion when she returned home to South Korea as a national
heroine and probably the biggest sports sensation her country has
ever had.
 &HT;    A news conference upon her arrival at the airport had to be
stopped after 10 minutes because of the crowd. Her face was
plastered on the front pages of almost every major newspaper. She
was the lead item on the television news. ``While I am here, I want
to take a rest, no matter what,'' Pak said. ``Going shopping and
gossiping with friends, that's what I want the most.'' Fat chance.
 &HT;    Her week was loaded down with appearances and golf tournaments,
a mile-long parade and a medal ceremony with the president. Small
wonder that Pak spent most of the week in a hospital recovering
from a cold and exhaustion. She wound up pulling out of the Japan
Classic, which in effect ended any chance Pak had of catching
Annika Sorenstam in the points race for player of the year.
 &HT;    But then, the way her whirlwind season had been going, she
didn't have much of a kick left in her. During one stretch this
season, Pak played 11 out of 13 weeks. After winning the Open, she
played the next four tournaments. ``That really did her in,''
Leadbetter said. ``She was playing on momentum and adrenaline, and
everybody wanted her to play. It was way too much. She wasn't
working out, she lost her fitness level. All these were
contributing factors.'' In her final nine tournaments of the year,
she finished inside the top 10 only once, and her scoring average
was 71.9, nearly one stroke higher than her first 18 tournaments.
 &HT;    ``It doesn't matter how good a horse is, you can't race it every
week,'' Leadbetter said. And that's why his next piece of advice
may have more to do with ``shopping and gossiping'' than alignment
and hip rotation. While playing golf with Woods, Pak says she was
inspired how to enjoy golf and how to enjoy life.
 &HT;    ``We can't forget that she's just a kid,'' Leadbetter said.
That's an important reminder for Pak and everyone around her.

   `BLOODY SUNDAY' WITH THE REVEREND. Martin Luther King is revered
for making the civil rights movement a matter of conscience. But
another remarkable side of the movement is rarely mentioned, writes
columnist Bill Maxwell: the bravery of the thousands of old people
throughout the South who joined the marches and willingly faced the
teargas, the dogs, the truncheons, the guns. Maxwell describes
marching alongside an old woman who was later struck and kicked by
state troopers during a historic demonstration in Selma, Ala.
``King knew how important these old folk were, for he routinely
praised them in speech and in deed,'' says Maxwell. ``He brought
out the best in all of us.''

   THE BIG LIE VS. THE BIG TRUTH. The Big Lie has various
components but encompasses two themes _ illegal immigrants and
legal immigrants _ and erroneous concepts about both, notes
columnist Raoul Lowery Contreras. The opponents of illegals are
almost always the opponents of legals. Their argument that ``a
tidal wave of immigrants will overrun the country, choke cities,
increase pollution, dumb down our schools, rip off the welfare
system, drain tax payers, and work for low wages to the detriment
of others,'' is completely wrong writes Contreras, who offers
correct data about immigrants coming to America. ``And, anyway, the
truth is, without young immigrants, the United States will fall
victim to old age.''

   ``INDIANS HELPING INDIANS'' IS A MOTTO WHOSE TIME HAS COME.
History has made it clear that neither the states nor federal
government (nor tribal governments, for that matter) have found a
way to reduce the unemployment on many Indian reservations,
observes columnist Tim Giago. Costly programs have failed, he says,
because there has never been any long-range planning and the
Band-Aid approach to treating a major wound has proven ineffective.
``But I suggest (again) one possible cure: that successful Indian
casino owners provide jobs to tribes with high unemployment,''
Giago writes. ``The old motto, `Indians helping Indians' should be
the motto of the new millennium, now that there are so many
financially successful Indian nations.''

   `BLOODY SUNDAY' WITH THE REVEREND. Martin Luther King is revered
for making the civil rights movement a matter of conscience. But
another remarkable side of the movement is rarely mentioned, writes
columnist Bill Maxwell: the bravery of the thousands of old people
throughout the South who joined the marches and willingly faced the
teargas, the dogs, the truncheons, the guns. Maxwell describes
marching alongside an old woman who was later struck and kicked by
state troopers during a historic demonstration in Selma, Ala.
``King knew how important these old folk were, for he routinely
praised them in speech and in deed,'' says Maxwell. ``He brought
out the best in all of us.''

   THE BIG LIE VS. THE BIG TRUTH. The Big Lie has various
components but encompasses two themes _ illegal immigrants and
legal immigrants _ and erroneous concepts about both, notes
columnist Raoul Lowery Contreras. The opponents of illegals are
almost always the opponents of legals. Their argument that ``a
tidal wave of immigrants will overrun the country, choke cities,
increase pollution, dumb down our schools, rip off the welfare
system, drain tax payers, and work for low wages to the detriment
of others,'' is completely wrong writes Contreras, who offers
correct data about immigrants coming to America. ``And, anyway, the
truth is, without young immigrants, the United States will fall
victim to old age.''

   ``INDIANS HELPING INDIANS'' IS A MOTTO WHOSE TIME HAS COME.
History has made it clear that neither the states nor federal
government (nor tribal governments, for that matter) have found a
way to reduce the unemployment on many Indian reservations,
observes columnist Tim Giago. Costly programs have failed, he says,
because there has never been any long-range planning and the
Band-Aid approach to treating a major wound has proven ineffective.
``But I suggest (again) one possible cure: that successful Indian
casino owners provide jobs to tribes with high unemployment,''
Giago writes. ``The old motto, `Indians helping Indians' should be
the motto of the new millennium, now that there are so many
financially successful Indian nations.''

   U.S. POSTAGE STAMP TO COMMEMORATE MALCOLM X. The formerly
described ``angriest black man in America,'' Malcolm X is now to be
depicted on a postage stamp in the Postal Service's Black Heritage
Series, started in 1978 to commemorate the individual achievements
of African-Americans. The Malcolm X stamp is the 22nd stamp in the
series, writes columnist Akilah Monifa. ``Though I greatly admired
the man, a Malcolm X postage stamp was the farthest concept from my
mind,'' Monifa adds. ``I'm sure from his, too.'' Can a Malcolm X
holiday be far behind? she wonders.

TEXAS PANEL CITES EMPLOYEE ERRORS IN INMATE'S ESCAPE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional trims) 
 
By KATHY WALT 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A special panel looking into a death row inmate's
daring Thanksgiving escape laid most of the blame Thursday squarely
on the shoulders of prison employees, citing negligence _ including
a guard who lost precious time getting his gun because he was
sneaking a smoke.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the committee's findings, released during the
Texas Board of Criminal Justice meeting in Houston, Ellis I Prison
warden Bruce Thaler was demoted, said Wayne Scott, executive
director of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Thaler's two assistant wardens at the Huntsville-area unit,
Charles Williams and Casey Staples, will be reassigned to other
prisons, and at least three guards face disciplinary action,
ranging from probation to firing, Scott added. Prison officials did
not identify the guards.
</P>
<P>
   Scott said one of those facing disciplinary action is a picket
guard who, investigators said, wasted time in responding to Martin
Gurule and six other death row inmates because he went into the
tower to throw his contraband cigarette in the toilet before
picking up his rifle to shoot at the convicts as they headed for
the fences.
</P>
<P>
   State law prohibits smoking on state property.
</P>
<P>
   ``How they did it (escaped) _ in a nutshell, it's human error,''
said Texas Board of Criminal Justice member Mac Stringfellow of San
Antonio, one of nine committee members. ``When employees are
negligent ... systems breakdown ... (and) there were a lot of
breakdowns in policies and procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   But the committee also attributed some of the blame to flaws in
the design and construction of the 30-year-old Ellis Unit, a work
program that gave condemned killers as much freedom of movement as
inmates in minimum-custody facilities, and the physical fitness of
seven determined inmates who plotted their escape for several
months.
</P>
<P>
   Board chairman Allan Polunsky of San Antonio appointed the
committee following the escape by Gurule, 29, who scaled two
10-foot, razor wire-topped fences in a hail of gunfire. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Gurule's body was found Dec. 3 about a mile from the unit,
floating in Harmon Creek, where he had drowned. The six other
inmates surrendered when guards opened fire from pickets, or
towers, along the fence line.
</P>
<P>
   The report acknowledged that the other six condemned killers
also had scaled the first fence before they surrendered. That is a
key discrepancy from the accounting prison officials gave at the
time of the escape. At that point, officials never admitted the
other six had gotten over one fence.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they were unable to determine how Gurule and
his accomplices got a portion of a hacksaw blade, which they used
to cut a hole in a recreation yard fence, one of the first steps
they took in the escape.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities traced the blade to a specific manufacturer who last
delivered a supply of blades to maintenance and storage units on
the Ellis grounds in 1991. But they said they don't know how or
when that blade got in the death row prisoners' hands. It is not
uncommon, though, for prison officials to confiscate weapons
fashioned by prisoners from all sorts of items.
</P>
<P>
   The committee, however, recommended that TDCJ increase the
frequency of strip searches to find contraband more quickly and to
re-evaluate the need to sell carbon paper and colored markers in
the commissary. The inmates used carbon paper and markers to dye
their underwear black.
</P>
<P>
   The committee further found that the second and third shifts at
Ellis were insufficiently staffed the night of the escape. For
adequate security, it said, a minimum of 27 officers is needed on
the second shift and 18 are needed on the third shift.
</P>
<P>
   But TDCJ records showed that only 24 officers worked second
shift and 16 worked third shift. The second shift shortage was
aggravated, the committee found, when two guards were allowed to
leave work early.
</P>
<P>
   ``The staff shortages can be attributed to the sergeants giving
too many officers the night off,'' the report states.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, board member Stringfellow said the condemned killers had
originally planned their escape for New year's _ another holiday in
which they anticipated staff shortages and perhaps more lax
attitudes. But the time to flee was moved up, he said, after guards
began finding and confiscating contraband the prisoners were
accumulating. The items were found during routine cell searches.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scott, however, continued to insist Thursday, as administrators
did immediately after the escape, that the Ellis Unit was not
understaffed.
</P>
<P>
   In citing employee negligence, the committee said that not only
was there inadequate supervision but employees ignored established
prison policies and procedures for conducting bed counts and
monitoring inmate activities. Instead of counting ``living,
breathing bodies,'' as they should have, some inspections were
conducted only with the use of television monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Gurule and the would-be escapees stuffed dummies and put them in
their beds. Guards doing bed checks counted the lumps in the beds
as bodies, despite policies that say they must see flesh and
recognize the inmate in the bed, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also determined that the death row work program,
which Polunsky suspended after the escape, allowed the inmates to
``conspire over an extended period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee recommended that TDCJ amend its policy on
selecting work-capable prisoners to ban anyone who has ever been
involved in an escape attempt. One of Gurule's accomplices, Ponchai
Wilkerson, had attempted to escape five years earlier and had an
extensive disciplinary history. Despite those problems, a death row
review committee allowed him back in the work program after he kept
his nose clean for 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The committee also noted that some employees' attitude of just
putting in their eight hours on the job was indicative of
management weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interviews surfaced an `eight to gate' mentality in some
personnel that must be addressed through selection processes,
morale, communications, incentives and effective leadership,'' the
report found.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The report also cited unidentified guards who failed to
supervise death row prisoners in the recreation yard, and others
who did not supervise condemned prisoners on a work squad and did
not maintain security in cell blocks by closing cell doors.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, TDCJ's executive director, said the agency already has
implemented security procedures the committee recommended, included
checking identification cards of prisoners going to and returning
from recreation areas.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In identifying physical inadequacies of the unit, the committee
noted that metal lattice on prison windows served as ladders,
giving Gurule and the others to easily reach the roof. Twenty-two
inch high parapets also provided adequate room for the prisoners to
crawl and roll some 680 feet along the main prison rooftop without
being detected by guards.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The committee also recommended that TDCJ consider moving death
row to another, newer facility and that it install sensors on the
prison rooftop and additional guard towers in the recreation yards.
The recommendation that death row be moved is one prison
administrators are studying, Scott said.

 WASHINGTON:: swirling about.''   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Republicans know the trial is unpopular with Americans.
Clinton's job approval ratings rose after his State of the Union
address on Tuesday night, ranging from 66 percent in an ABC poll to
72 percent in a CBS survey to 76 percent according to NBC.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But many Republicans say they must push ahead with their solemn
duty and not be swayed by opinion polls. Moreover, they add, it's
natural that Democrats would try to seize on the momentum from the
White House's defense.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The prosecution presented their case and everyone said, `Oh,
OK,''' said Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, a former county prosecutor.
``Then the defense presented their case. Everybody said, `Oh, OK.'
This is a natural rhythm to a trial, and we're into it.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both parties say the momentum could shift again after the
questioning starts. Democrats and Republicans have each collected
dozens of possible queries from senators. Each side will alternate
asking questions.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, there are conflicts in what has been said by the
House managers and the White House,'' Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the
majority leader, told reporters after Thursday's arguments.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There appear to be conflicts between what the witnesses have
said,'' Lott added. ``This is an important part of the process as
we try to clarify the disputes.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The questions will delve into both the perjury and obstruction
of justice charges. ``How many interns in the White House would the
president, Vernon Jordan and Betty Currie find a good job for on an
expedited basis?'' said Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore. ``That's still
troubling.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the questioning, the Senate is set to vote on whether to
dismiss the case, perhaps as early as Monday. Senate Republicans
outnumber Democrats, 55- 45, so six Republicans would have to
defect and all Democrats would have to hold firm to dump the case.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both sides say outright dismissal is unlikely. So Democrats are
eyeing the next vote, to depose witnesses, as a proxy for
dismissal. Senators say the outcome of that vote is less certain.
But even if it fails, Democrats say it carries political potency
for them because they can accuse Republicans of dragging out a
trial that is unpopular with the public.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear how many Republicans are uneasy about calling
witnesses. Some Republicans, including Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine,
voiced concerns at a party caucus Thursday morning about the impact
of a lengthy deposition process.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But many Republicans rejected the idea of bypassing a vote on
witnesses. ``To do anything that would abridge the process of
getting to the truth or to arbitrarily cut short that process
because it's inconvenient, is unwise,'' said Sen. Chuck Hagel,
R-Neb.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pushing ahead with depositions, knowing that senators will have
a second vote on which, if any, witnesses actually testify at the
trial, still carries risks of prolonging the trial, lawmakers
conceded.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This train,'' said folksy Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont., ``may
not have no brakes.''

 &HT;    Clinton defense closes; senators to question arguments
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett and Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senators get their first turn today to question the
arguments and evidence in the impeachment trial of President
Clinton after sitting silently through two weeks of proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Senators will have two days to submit written questions to White
House lawyers and House prosecutors, an opportunity most will
probably use to explore gaps in the testimony and examine the
constitutional standards for conviction and removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the White House concluded its defense of the
president with a passionate plea from a former colleague and
longtime friend of Clinton's. Former Sen. Dale Bumpers, a mentor to
Clinton for 25 years, implored his colleagues to set aside their
party loyalties and spare the nation the divisive consequences of
removing a popular president from office.
</P>
<P>
   After days of legal and constitutional arguments from both
prosecutors and the defense team, Bumpers also sought to humanize
the president, presenting him as an aggrieved husband and father
who had suffered shame, embarrassment and worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``A relationship between husband and wife, father and child has
been incredibly strained, if not destroyed,'' he said. ``There's
been nothing but sleepless nights, mental agony for this family for
almost five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The punishment of removing Bill Clinton from office would pale
compared to the punishment he has already inflicted on himself.
There's a feeling ... that somehow or other Bill Clinton has gotten
away with something. Mr. Leader, I can tell you, he hasn't gotten
away with anything.''
</P>
<P>
   In much the same way that the sentiment in the Senate appeared
to be hardening toward Clinton after House prosecutors laid out
their case, there were some signals that the tide appeared to be
shifting in the president's favor at the conclusion of his defense.
</P>
<P>
   At least three Republican senators said Thursday that House
managers would have to lay out a very strong case to convince them
of the need for witnesses, and GOP leaders said they were uncertain
that they could muster 51 votes to subpoena witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of anyone who could be of help at this point,''
said Sen. James Jeffords (R-Vt.).
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone would have to make a compelling case for witnesses
before I'd vote for it,'' said Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.). ``I
think we all probably have heard enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans also began to intensify their efforts
Thursday to negotiate a game plan on how to proceed with the next
phase of the trial: how to handle witnesses, if they are called,
and how to bring the proceedings to a close.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to figure out whether or not there's a way to
keep this on an even keel, a nonpartisan keel,'' said Sen. John
Kerry (D-Mass.).
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.) said several Republicans whom he would
not name approached him saying they were looking for a ``graceful,
honorable way to save face and get out of this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People may be surprised in the end on how few votes there are
for conviction,'' Baucus said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican leaders dismissed such speculation as Democratic
``spin,'' saying there was no weakening in GOP resolve to move
forward with a full-blown trial with witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not tell in our conference that there was any
weakening,'' said Sen. Connie Mack (R-Fla.).
</P>
<P>
   One idea gaining support among Republicans is to allow the House
prosecutors an opportunity to formally rebut the White House
defense. Jeffords, a Republican moderate, suggested this might be
one way to make sure ``we haven't shorted anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Bumpers, a gifted speaker, largely lived up to his advance
billing, alternately making his colleagues laugh and then engaging
them with heartfelt stories about his early days with Clinton in
Arkansas and his own experience growing up as a country lawyer in
rural Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Joking about his penchant for roaming the Senate chamber when he
spoke, he said that he had been limited to only 28 feet of
microphone cord instead of 40 feet. He joked that he considered an
offer from Republicans not to deliver his speech in exchange for a
few votes.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Bumpers launched into remarks about his long relationship
with Clinton and their struggle to improve education in rural
Arkansas and boost living conditions in the Mississippi Delta where
``the poverty was unspeakable.''
</P>
<P>
   He quoted world leaders praising Clinton's efforts to negotiate
peace in the Middle East, Ireland and the emerging democracies in
central Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Bumpers also delivered a scholarly dissection of the framers'
intent behind the Constitution's impeachment clause.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the framers, meeting in Philadelphia to draft the
Constitution 210 years ago, successively revised the impeachment
clause to make it apply to only the most serious crimes that were
``distinctly political offenses against the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebutting charges that Clinton had subverted the ``rule of
law,'' Bumpers said the rule of law also demanded that the
punishment fit the crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very big difference between perjury about a marital
infidelity in a divorce case and perjury about whether I bought the
murder weapon,'' he said. ``To charge somebody with the first and
punish them as though it was the second stands justice ... on its
head.''
</P>
<P>
   Bumpers also made the argument that has offended many
Republicans _ that Clinton's case was about sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``H.L. Mencken said, when you hear somebody say this is not
about money, it's about money,'' said Bumpers, who spoke from
hand-written notes scribbled on yellow paper. ``And when you hear
somebody say this is not about sex, it's about sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``You pick you own adjective to describe the president's
conduct. Here are some I would use: indefensible, outrageous,
unforgivable, shameless. I promise you, the president would not
contest any of those.''
</P>
<P>
   While eloquent, Bumpers appeared not to have changed many
Republican minds about the president. Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah)
said Bumpers gave a partisan speech whose purpose was to ``shore
up'' Democratic support for the president.
</P>
<P>
   And Bumpers' charge that House prosecutors had shown little
compassion to Clinton and his family prompted a quick response from
Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde (R-Ill.).
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd be inhuman if you didn't have compassion for what the
president is going through _ and his family,'' said Hyde. ``I
certainly understand it. But we have a constitutional duty to
perform, and we're trying, as best we can, with a hostile
environment, to do our job.''
</P>
<P>
   David Kendall, Clinton's personal lawyer, led off Thursday's
presentation with an unsubtle reminder of the length and breadth of
independent counsel Kenneth Starr's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall, a partner at the Washington law firm Williams &AMP;
Connolly, noted that, since 1993, he has represented the president
in the ``tortuous and meandering Whitewater investigation, which
approximately a year ago was transformed in a remarkable way into
the Lewinsky investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer's real business, however, was to attempt to poke
holes in the article of impeachment that accuses Clinton of
obstructing justice in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   He repeatedly praised the House prosecutors as skillful,
polished and able, but he offered a detailed critique of their
work, attributing the ``myths'' about the evidence in the case, in
part, to ``concerted partisan distortion.''
</P>
<P>
   In a two-and-a-half hour presentation that won praise from some
Republicans for its thoroughness, but left other senators fidgeting
and yawning, Kendall said that no element of the prosecution's
obstruction of justice case withstands scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence plainly shows that the president did not obstruct
justice in any way and there is nothing in this article that would
warrant his removal from office,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall sought to demolish five of the seven obstruction of
justice counts, following White House deputy counsel Cheryl Mills'
discussion of the other two counts on Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
   _ Clinton did not encourage Lewinsky to file a false affidavit
denying a sexual relationship between them.
</P>
<P>
   _ The president never asked Lewinsky to testify falsely in the
Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   _ Clinton did not obstruct justice by allegedly allowing Robert
Bennett, his attorney in the Jones case, to make false and
misleading statements to a federal judge.
</P>
<P>
   _ The president's statements to his aides denying an affair with
Lewinsky mirror his statements to his family and the nation, and
cannot amount to obstruction of justice since his aides were not
witnesses in the Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   _ Clinton did not order an intensified effort to find Lewinsky a
job to influence her testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting the White House's favorite piece of testimony from
Lewinsky in which she said no one asked her to lie, Kendall said,
``Is there something difficult to understand here?''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall also noted that Lewinsky testified after she reached her
immunity agreement with independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   She faced the threat of prosecution for perjury and the
withdrawal of the immunity agreement if she lied to the grand jury,
Kendall said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever cover stories Clinton and Lewinsky discussed occurred
before Lewinsky's name appeared on a witness list in the Jones
case, he said.

<P>
   Theodore Tannenwald Jr., a senior judge on the U.S. Tax Court in
Washington, a foreign-aid adviser to three Democratic presidents
and a governor of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion
in New York City for the last 40 years, died Jan. 17 at Georgetown
University Hospital. He was 82 and lived in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Tannenwald was appointed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965,
and his colleagues elected him to a two-year term as chief judge in
1981. He took senior status in 1983 but continued to keep a hefty
docket and fill in as chief judge.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Valatie, N.Y., he graduated summa cum laude in political
science and mathematics from Brown University in 1936. He earned
his law degree magna cum laude at Harvard Law School in 1939 and
joined the firm of Weil, Gotshal &AMP; Manges, based in Manhattan. He
remained a partner there until his appointment to the court.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II he counseled the Lend-Lease Administration
and the foreign-funds control division of the State Department. He
performed advisory functions in the Truman, Kennedy and Johnson
administrations, including membership at the President's Task Force
on Foreign Assistance.
</P>
<P>
   He lectured at George Washington University, the University of
Miami Law School and, most recently, the University of San Diego
Law School, where he was a distinguished adjunct professor until
1991, and at the School of Law of the University of Minnesota since
then. Last year, the American Bar Association honored him with a
Distinguished Service Award.
</P>
<P>
   He served on the national executive board and board of governors
of the American Jewish Committee. At Hebrew Union he was a former
chairman of the board of governors.
</P>
<P>
   Tannenwald's survivors include his wife of 58 years, Selma
``Pete'' Peterfreund Tannenwald; two sons, Peter, of Washington,
and Robert, of Newton, Mass.; and three grandsons.

IBM'S EARNINGS UP 12 PERCENT FOR QUARTER AND 4 PERCENT FOR YEAR
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   International Business Machines Corp. on Thursday reported a 12
percent gain in quarterly earnings, exceeding Wall Street analysts'
estimates by 2 cents a share. IBM said strong gains in software and
services were offset by the economic turmoil in Asia and Latin
America, as well as pricing pressure on key products.
</P>
<P>
   IBM reported its results after the market closed. Shares of IBM
rose $2.50, to $197, on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.
They fell to $190 in after-hours trading on Instinet.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter, IBM reported earnings of $2.35 billion, or
$2.47 a diluted share, up from $2.09 billion, or $2.11 a share, in
the period a year ago. Revenues grew 6 percent, to $25.13 billion
from $23.72 billion in the fourth quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected IBM to earn $2.45 a share, according to
First Call.
</P>
<P>
   Although best known for the mainframes, minicomputers and
personal computers that bear its name, IBM now derives nearly 60
percent of its total gross profits from global services and
software, two businesses that provide substantial revenues. The
so-called OEM business, for original-equipment manufacturer, in
which IBM sells technology to other companies, is another growing
source of revenue even as IBM's computer hardware sales decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good quarter, but it might have been a great
quarter,'' were it not for the 2 percent decline in hardware
revenues, said Steven Milunovich, an analyst with Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, IBM reported earnings of $6.33 billion, or $6.57 a
diluted share, up 4 percent from $6.09 billion, or $6.01 a share,
in the prior year. Revenues rose 4 percent to $81.67 billion from
$78.51 billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In the quarter, personal-computer sales were up, but revenues
from mainframes and servers were both down. The drop in mainframe
revenues came despite a 60 percent gain in shipments, measured in
processing power, as IBM slashed prices to meet competition from
Hitachi Ltd. and Fujitsu Ltd. Sales of servers, including the
AS/400 and RS/6000 models, slowed as customers waited for new
models.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem in hardware is a lack of focus and mindshare,''
Milunovich said. ``If you're thinking Unix, you think Sun; if
you're thinking NT, IBM did well in NT servers, but Compaq and
Hewlett-Packard have been there a lot longer.'' IBM makes servers
that run the Unix operating system, a variant of which runs on
machines from Sun Microsystems, as well as servers that run
Microsoft's Windows NT.
</P>
<P>
   ``We achieved good earnings results in the quarter despite a
number of challenges: continued weakness in Asia and Latin America,
ongoing softness in memory chip prices, and pricing pressures and
product transitions that adversely affected our server business,''
said IBM chairman and chief executive Louis Gerstner in a
statement. ``We have been able to deliver consistent financial
results because of the breadth and diversity of our overall
business portfolio.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM, which is based in Armonk, N.Y., said it spent about $1.6
billion on share repurchases in the fourth quarter, reducing the
average number of shares outstanding in the quarter to 919.8
million, down 4.6 percent compared with 964.8 million during the
period a year earlier. Buying back shares has the effect of
increasing earnings per share independent of, or in addition to,
genuine earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast with hardware revenues, which declined 2 percent, to
$11.3 billion, service revenues increased 20 percent, to $7.1
billion, compared with the fourth quarter of 1997. Total software
revenues were $4.1 billion, up 9 percent year over year.
Maintenance revenues were $1.5 billion, a decrease of 3 percent,
while rentals and financing revenues grew 10 percent to $1.1
billion. Gross profit margin was 39 percent in the fourth quarter
compared with 40.1 percent in the corresponding period a year ago.

NEW-LOOK DAILY RACING FORM MAKES IMPACT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Removes chart from bottom of story) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ When Steve Crist wrote recently about the
horse-racing industry's most significant developments of 1998, he
listed the popularity of the guaranteed pick-six, the founding of
the NTRA ``league office'' and indications the economic bleeding
has stopped. He also left out a big one.
</P>
<P>
   It must have been modesty that prevented Crist from including
the changes in the Daily Racing Form since the 105-year-old
newspaper was purchased in July by a group he led.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been unseemly for me to herald that as a major
development,'' Crist said with a laugh on the phone from New York
this week. ``I'll let someone else say that. I wouldn't disagree
with you.''
</P>
<P>
   As editor and publisher, Crist has shaken up the Form's lineup
of writers, columnists and handicappers and stirred up readers with
changes in the past-performance charts from which serious
horseplayers pick winners. Added are details on runners' pedigrees,
recent class levels and opponents, and distance and surface
specialties.
</P>
<P>
   On top of the additions to Form data inspired by Crist's
innovative but short-lived Racing Times in 1991-92, the latest
round of improvements have created past performances with much of
the data _ speed figures, turf and muddy-track statistics, and
next-out winners from ``key races'' _ that studious fans used to
have to compile themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom holds that giving that data to Form readers
deprives the sharpies of their edge and makes it harder to beat the
races. But Crist said he has no qualms about providing ``a
timesaver.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My guiding principle (is) if somebody could mark up my Racing
Form for me and save me two or three hours a day of extra work and
research, what would I want to see in there?'' said Crist, a
Harvard-educated former New York Times racing writer. ``I haven't
heard anybody say, `I wish I had to spend an extra two hours a day
doing my own homework.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there's a school of thought that the second you put
speed figures in the Racing Form, that took away a big edge or it
changed the game. But it seems to me favorites are still winning at
the same percentage they were 10 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' he added, ``the game gets tougher and you're not
getting the occasional 12-1 (odds) on a standout top figure horse
that Andy (Beyer) was getting in Florida in 1986. But as you well
know, you can give 10 handicappers the same information and they'll
come up with 10 different horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all judgment calls and subtleties and your perception of
the value of the (odds). No matter how good you make the PPs,
they're never going to produce 100 percent winners.''
</P>
<P>
   Crist's goal is to win back the readers who have turned to
expanded track programs for past-performance data, slicing the
Form's circulation among racegoers from 30 percent to 15 percent.
He hopes the launch of a Form on-line service in about two months
will expand the audience. Expanded PPs are part of the pitch.
</P>
<P>
   A Santa Anita racegoer joked last week that the next step is to
include an update on each horse's appetite. In fact, Crist said,
only one further change is planned _ a listing of each runner's
auction price.
</P>
<P>
   Some readers want more. One asked for an indication that a horse
was washy. Another wanted a symbol when a horse wears a tongue tie.
</P>
<P>
   Said Crist: ``I end up saying, `Hey, if someone thinks that's
real important, let him (do the research and) have that as his
edge.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dot's a shame: Dixie Dot Com's dominating victory in the San
Fernando Stakes on Saturday will be his last for months. The
4-year-old colt came out of the race with a hairline fracture in
his left front shin and will have surgery Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Bill Morey-trained horse missed most of 1998 with a similar
fracture in the same leg. That injury didn't require surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Dixie Dot Com would have been favored in the $500,000 Strub
Stakes on Feb. 6.
</P>
<P>
   99 days to go: Time to throw out the ceremonial first Kentucky
Derby contender of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Doneraile Court _ popular because of his Derby-winning sire
(Seattle Slew), jockey (Jerry Bailey), trainer (Nick Zito) and
owner (Michael Tabor) _ was the big loser in the Holy Bull Stakes
won by 14-1 Grits'n Hard Toast at Gulfstream Park on Saturday. He
floundered late in the 1 1/16-mile race, an early test for horses
aiming at the 1\-mile Derby on May 1.
</P>
<P>
   Vicar, fifth as the favorite, had the excuse of traffic trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Not Doneraile Court. Toss him out.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie D. countdown: Eddie Delahoussaye went winless at Santa
Anita on Thursday and is six from 6,000. He'll be the 14th jockey
to win that many races.
</P>
<P>
   Such a milestone _ let alone winning two Derbies and seven
Breeders' Cup races and making the Hall of Fame _ was far from his
mind when he started riding 31 years ago in his native Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I wanted to do was ride horses and win races. It wasn't
until (1978), when I was leading rider in the country, that I said,
`Maybe there's a little more to it than winning races,' ''
Delahoussaye said. ``I said, `All right, now we gotta go ... get
some Derby horses.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The weekend: Sunday's Santa Monica Handicap at Santa Anita, the
nation's first Grade I stakes of the year, finds Japanese $3.4
millionaire Seeking the Pearl and jockey Yutaka Take facing a solid
field of female sprinters.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-furlong race includes Belle's Flag, starting for the first
time since her California Cup Matron win; Love That Jazz, coming
off her Vernon Underwood win for the Kent Desormeaux-Neil Drysdale
team; and Stop Traffic, 0 for 3 since winning the Ballerina at
Saratoga.

KOSOVO MASSACRE WAS ACT OF REVENGE BY SERBIAN FORCES, MONITORS
REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  (fe) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ International monitors who discovered the bodies of
45 ethnic Albanians shot execution-style, have concluded in their
official report that the attack in the Kosovo village was an act of
revenge by Serbian forces for the killing of four of their men.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which has not been made public, described a scene of
bodies with wounds from gunshots at close range and in some cases
at ``extremely close range'' in the front, back or top of the head,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The monitors, who were on the scene immediately before and after
the massacre, concluded that ``the facts as verified by the Kosovo
Verification Mission include evidence of arbitrary detentions,
extrajudicial killings and the mutilation of unarmed civilians of
Albanian ethnic origin by the Yugoslav Army and police.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, written chronologically from Jan. 8 to Jan. 16, the
day after the killings, listed each body found at the site, saying,
for example: ``One adult male killed outside his house. The top of
his head had been removed and was found approximately 15 feet away
from his place of death. The wound appeared to have been caused by
an ax but may have been from a bullet.''
</P>
<P>
   The report said one 12-year-old-boy was shot in the neck and one
male teen-ager was shot in the abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the massacre last Saturday and the immediate
assertion at the scene by a senior U.S. diplomat that Serbian
forces were responsible for the killings led to the current crisis
within the Clinton administration and NATO over what to do about
the separatist province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has blamed the Yugoslav leader, Slobodan
Milosevic, for allowing his troops to use disproportionate force
against people the administration identified as civilians.
State-controlled media in Serbia have asserted that the massacre
was a fake, staged by the ethnic Albanian guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The circumstances of the massacre were further inflamed when
Milosevic accused William Walker, the American diplomat who heads
the teams of international monitors for the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe. The Serbs accused him of being
a stooge of the ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   It now appears Walker will be allowed to remain on the job, but
the Clinton administration said that was ``not sufficient'' and
that the Milosevic must reduce his forces in Kosovo or face
possible airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   The account of the killings, titled: ``Special Report: Massacre
of Civilians in Racak,'' was written by monitors of the OSCE's
Kosovo Verification Mission and has been made available to
diplomats from the 54 member countries.
</P>
<P>
   Details in the account were graphically elaborated on in an oral
presentation given to the organization in Vienna by a German
diplomat, Berend Borchardt, who was at the scene of the slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Borchardt, the deputy head of the human rights mission of the
OSCE in Kosovo, told the diplomats in Vienna that the victims were
``humble peasants,'' many of whom were dressed in rubber boots.
Borchardt pointed out that the male victims were not dressed in
heavy boots used in military action.
</P>
<P>
   In their report, the monitors said that after the
``well-prepared ambush'' by the ethnic Albanian guerrillas that
left four Serbian police officers dead, Serbian forces started
moving armored vehicles into the area of Stimlje, near Racak.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the massacre, Jan. 15, the monitors were prevented
by Serbian forces from entering Racak but could see houses burning
there.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the day, the report said, a patrol car of monitors drove
into the village. The monitors saw one dead Albanian civilian and
five injured people and heard reports that 20 males had been taken
away by Serbian forces. The monitors had to leave because darkness
was falling, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning several teams of monitors returned to the
village and heard accounts from survivors who said that after
artillery attacks by the Yugoslav army and Serbian police, Serbian
security forces entered the village. Some were dressed in police
uniforms, and others were in black uniforms and ski masks.
</P>
<P>
   The witnesses said they recognized some of the policemen ase
being from Stimlje. The survivors also said that the some of the
``assailants'' were Serbian civilians dressed in police uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies were found at three sites in the village, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-three men ``of various ages,'' last seen alive when the
police were arresting them, were found on a ridge behind the
village. Four other men were found in a ravine near the village and
were apparently shot while trying to run away. Twelve men and the
12-year-old boy were found in various places within the village,
including in some homes.
</P>
<P>
   Some families retrieved the bodies of their relatives and
brought them inside, the report said. Five more adults had been
taken by family members to nearby Malopoljce.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Walker arrived at the scene at 1 p.m. on Saturday,
the Serb forces had left and there was a ``heavy presence of
uniformed KLA in the village,'' the report said, referring to the
Kosovo Liberation Army. The guerrillas, who were agitated and in a
vengeful mood, were advised by Walker to exercise restraint, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   After the report was written, diplomats said that 40 of the 45
bodies were removed by the Serbian police from a village mosque,
where they were being prepared by families for burial, to the
government morgue in Pristina where Serbian doctors are conducting
autopsies.

 &HT;    House prosecutors request rebuttal
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Mounting a challenge to Senate Republicans, House
prosecutors Thursday requested a chance to rebut the White House
counsel's case, saying the defense had mispresented the facts.
</P>
<P>
   The request for rebuttal time came at the close of three days of
defense from White House lawyers that even some Republican senators
said had effectively raised doubts about the prosecution's case
that the president lied under oath and obstructed justice to
conceal his affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors said they fear that without the rebuttal time,
the case against the president would lose momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``The questions and answers are really a form of rebuttal,''
said Sen. Larry Craig (R-Idaho), a member of the Senate leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats expressed little sympathy, pointing out that the
Senate rules were negotiated in advance. Although rebuttal time had
been discussed, the resolution governing the rules of the trial did
not include rebuttal time for the prosecution. But that did not
stop the House Republicans from appealing to senators to change
their minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We regret keenly that we have not been afforded the
opportunity for rebuttal,'' said Chairman Henry Hyde (R-Ill.),
chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last one to speak always has an advantage,'' said Hyde, a
former attorney. ``In every litigation that I've ever been involved
in, the person with the burden of proof gets a chance to rebut.''
</P>
<P>
   The chances Hyde and his team of 12 prosecutors will get more
time are slim. They are hoping that they will get a chance to ``set
the record straight'' during the question-and-answer stage of the
Senate trial, which is scheduled to begin today.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.), a House prosecutor and a former U.S.
attorney in Atlanta, said he has never seen a case in which the
party responsible for the burden of proof does not get an
opportunity to rebut.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely frustrating and very unfair,'' Barr said. ``It
really does stack the deck against you.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr said the White House put on a classic defense case, but it
was filled with ``misrepresenations of the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They could present it without fear of being held accountable
for it,'' Barr said. ``They could just say whatever they wanted and
it stands unless we can get some opportunity to rebut.''
</P>
<P>
   To counter the White House, Republican staffers distributed at
least 29 written responses on each contested point. The releases
read more like a political ad with claims and counter claims. One
statement lists the White House ``claim'' about what the law is on
obstruction of justice and then ``the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   During breaks in the trial, the prosecutors went straight to the
television cameras to attack the White House defense. At other
times, they stood in the basement of the Capitol, reiterating their
version of the facts.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to the defense, Rep. Asa Hutchinson (R-Ark.) said he
was so frustrated that he wanted to ``jump up and set the record
straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson said it would take him 30-40 minutes to go through
each point on which he disagreed with the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Cannon (R-Utah) said he was betting on the
questioning period to set the record straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can only be hopeful that the senators' questioning period
will be an opportunity to address discrepancies, the
mischaracterizations, obfuscations and lies put forth by the White
House counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   While Hyde and the 12 prosecutors are clearly unified in their
desire to rebut the White House's case, they are split on which
witnesses to call.
</P>
<P>
   Two camps of opinion are emerging.
</P>
<P>
   One group wants to limit the witness list to the main characters
of the saga: Monica Lewinsky; Betty Currie, the president's
personal secretary; Vernon Jordan, the president's close friend who
helped Lewinksky seek a job; and Sidney Blumenthal, a White House
aide.
</P>
<P>
   A second group is seeking to add five women who claim to have
had affairs with the president or unwanted sexual invitations from
him. Their hope is that the women would bolster their case against
the president because they would show a pattern of behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The witness list will not be made public until the conclusion of
the questioning period this weekend or Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Is this just an attempt to embarrass the president with more
tawdry tales?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a constitutional duty to perform, and we're trying, as
best we can, with a hostile environment, to do our job,'' Hyde
said.

CELEBRATED GEORGIA POLICE OFFICER IS KILLED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Texas, Calif.)  (lb) 
 By KEVIN SACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Robbie Bishop, a 35-year-old police captain with a
small-town force in Villa Rica, Ga., had developed a reputation
around the South as an officer with a sixth sense for sniffing out
drugs during routine traffic stops. In some innate, almost
inexplicable way, associates said, he could detect secret
compartments in cars and could tell when a truck was riding just a
little too low.
</P>
<P>
   During a decade-long career, Bishop confiscated thousands of
pounds of drugs and millions of dollars in cash, and was enlisted
by police departments around the United States to train their
officers. But that career came to an end on Wednesday in one of
those seemingly routine traffic stops on Interstate 20 in Carroll
County, west of Atlanta, when Bishop was killed by a gunshot to the
head.
</P>
<P>
   The police have charged a 32-year-old Schenectady, N.Y., man,
Jeffrey McGee, with the killing and have begun a multistate search
for him. In Bishop's ticket book they found a copy of a warning
ticket that he had written to McGee.
</P>
<P>
   About 4 a.m. Thursday the authorities found McGee's 1991
Chevrolet Blazer in a parking lot at the Birmingham, Ala., airport,
and they now believe that he boarded a Southwest Airlines flight on
Wednesday evening that made stops in Houston and Los Angeles, said
John Bankhead, a spokesman for the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Bankhead said McGee apparently bought his ticket using the alias
Travis McGee, a name he has occasionally used as a small-time
criminal in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Schenectady Gazette reported that McGee had an arrest record
in that city dating to 1984, when he was charged with assault. The
newspaper said McGee was charged again in 1991 for assault after
smashing a bottle across another man's face in a bar fight. He also
spent 90 days in jail for serving as the getaway driver in the
burglary of a pool hall. He was acquitted of rape in a 1986 case.
</P>
<P>
   Bankhead said it was unclear where McGee had gotten off the
flight from Birmingham, and whether he had caught another flight.
He said the FBI and the police departments in Houston and Los
Angeles were searching for him.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said Bishop might have been ticketing McGee when
something piqued his interest in searching the car. The car was now
being searched for traces of drugs, Bankhead said.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews and training films, Bishop regularly emphasized
the importance of safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Safety is a priority,'' he said in a training film broadcast
Thursday by WSB-TV in Atlanta. ``No load is worth your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop, a husband and the father of two children, was described
Thursday as an aggressive and dedicated investigator who was
considered by many to be the best in the Southeast at highway drug
interdiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just had an uncanny sixth sense at a traffic stop when he
thought someone might be carrying drugs,'' said Jimmy Jordan, the
chief deputy sheriff in Spalding County, where Bishop worked until
last May.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Alan Baverman, a criminal defense lawyer in Atlanta, recalled a
case in which the captain grew suspicious of two vehicles traveling
in tandem.
</P>
<P>
   ``He pulled them over and there were 50 kilos of cocaine in the
truck,'' Baverman said. ``He elevated that traffic stop almost to
an art form.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Roger Garrison in Cherokee County, where Bishop worked
in the early 1990s, said the officer ``could detect the smallest
infraction in a story, the inconsistencies told between a driver
and a passenger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very familiar with the design of automobiles and knew
where those hiding places were,'' Garrison said. ``He was
responsible for a couple of million-dollar seizures in Cherokee
County, and found a couple of tractor-trailer loads of marijuana.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop was often criticized by defense lawyers who maintained
that his searches stretched the bounds of constitutionality. Some
said he was particularly aggressive in stopping drivers who were
members of minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We challenged his searches all the time,'' Baverman said.
``But he was doing his job and doing his job well.''

CLINTON'S LEGAL TEAM BOOSTS DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After three days of trying to puncture House
Republicans' case against the president, White House lawyers appear
to have shored up the Democratic support needed to keep the
president in office.
</P>
<P>
   While most Democratic senators were not inclined to convict
President Clinton anyway, some had been shaken by the meticulous
case presented by Republicans' as to why the president may have
perjured himself and obstructed justice.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House lawyers methodically chipped away at the
mountain of evidence advanced by their adversaries in the Senate
impeachment trial, often providing contradictory testimony or
differing accounts of how events unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the lawyers avoided the confrontational approach
that alienated some lawmakers during their presentation at the
House impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of relentlessly attacking the integrity of independent
counsel Kenneth Starr or the motives of the president's critics,
they concentrated on the nitty gritty of the case, rebutting
point-by-point the accusations leveled by the House managers.
</P>
<P>
   In the end they handed enough ammunition to Democrat lawmakers,
who wanted some assurance that the charges filed by the House could
not stand up in regular court proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The White House injected some drama to complement the dry legal
reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   In a riveting performance,White House deputy counsel Cheryl
Mills rejected the charges that Clinton had undercut civil rights
and sexual harassment laws, noting that the president had given her
a chance to represent him.
</P>
<P>
   And in a folksy yet scholarly conclusion, former Arkansas Sen.
Dale Bumpers told his former colleagues that ousting the president
would pose a far graver danger to the nation than acquitting him.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, who last week had called the House presentation
``credible,'' gushed about the performance of the White House team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The arguments from the White House counsel have been very
strong and very compelling over the last few days,'' said Sen. Tim
Johnson, D-S.D.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's over,'' said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who
added that she believed that there was no way that the House
Republicans could muster the two-thirds majority vote needed for
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Even some Republicans said they were impressed by the testimony
of the lawyers who raised questions about such charges as whether
Clinton and his allies tried to get White House intern Monica
Lewinsky a job and convinced her to hide gifts from the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the president's lawyers have raised a lot of good
questions that will have to be answered by House managers,'' said
Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats believe that they have gained so much momentum that
they may be able to convince enough Republicans next week to vote
with them to dismiss the two articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of senators would be needed to dismiss the charges,
meaning six Republicans would have to join all 45 Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is still not clear that even a handful of
Republicans would be willing to end the trial without calling
witnesses. The Republican House managers have stressed that the
discrepancies in the accounts can only be cleared up by calling a
host of witnesses, including Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know any way to resolve those conflicts other than
hearing from the witnesses,'' said Rep. Asa Hutchison, R-Ark., a
House manager who watched with frustration as the White House
attorneys picked apart his presentation.
</P>
<P>
   The White House attorneys also did not make their case in a
vacuum A number of events that occurred simultaneously also may be
contributing to a subtle shift in momentum in the president's
favor.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's State of the Union address Tuesday evening bolstered
his public support, according to every poll taken, and helped the
White House underscore the perception that the president was
concentrating on the nation's business while the Republicans
focussed on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   While Republicans have suffered an erosion of public support
during the impeachment proceeding they have counted on strong
backing of their most reliable and conservative supporters.
</P>
<P>
   But even some of that support appeared to be waning as Pat
Robertson, the conservative evangelical leader who last December
called on Congress to oust the president, suggested that
Republicans ditch the impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said the president ``hit a home run,'' with the State
of the Union address and added ``from a public relations standpoint
he's won.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They might as well dismiss this impeachment hearing and get on
with something else, because it's over as far as I'm concerned,''
Robertson said on his television program, ``The 700 Club.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill, who is heading the House
Republican managers, replied that Robertson's statements just
showed that ``we are not tools of the Christian right.''

 &HT;    Gore plans $312 million for Everglades restoration
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Florida's troubled Everglades got a boost
Thursday when Vice President Al Gore proposed a $312 million
speed-up in the effort to restore the giant swamp.
</P>
<P>
   The new federal money is a 35 percent increase over funds
already designated for Everglades restoration. Much of the increase
would be spent on buying land surrounding the Everglades to stop
the encroachment of housing developments and roads from the
sprawling South Florida urban corridor.
</P>
<P>
   Gore announced the proposal during a visit to Orlando, and drew
quick praise from some environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an incredible proposal that is going to go a long way
toward the restoration and might even finish some restoration
projects,'' Patti Webster of the Broward County Environmental
Coalition told the Miami Herald newspaper. ``It shows once again
how serious President Clinton is about restoring the Everglades.''
</P>
<P>
   Under prodding from Clinton, Congress has approved some $900
million for Everglades restoration in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   The vast ecosystem has been decimated by the unforeseen effects
of drainage and water control systems installed decades ago by the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The system has drained huge tracts of
land for farmers and stopped flooding of urban areas, but has also
choked off the shallow, sheet-like flow of water that made the
Everglades thrive.
</P>
<P>
   Bird populations have plummeted, while fish, alligators and
other creatures are struggling to survive.
</P>
<P>
   For the past decade, government officials, environmentalists,
farmers and other interests have argued _ sometimes in court _ over
proposals to undo the damage.
</P>
<P>
   A final plan for the job is due from the Corps before Congress
this summer. In recent weeks, however, it has drawn fire from key
players, who argue it provides too much water for the urban areas
and not enough for the parched Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   Corps officials are scrambling to redraw portions of the plan
and better balance the various competing interests, but whether
they will garner support from all the factions remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   The overall project could cost as much as $8 billion and would
take years to complete.
</P>
<P>
   Activists were recently heartened by newly-elected Florida Gov.
Jeb Bush's appointment of an Everglades ``czar'' who will oversee
the restoration effort for the state.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he has already given Bush details of the proposed
restoration speed-up, and promised to continue working closely with
state officials on the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt in my mind that the federal government and
the state will continue this partnership,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Talk about a reversal of fortune.
</P>
<P>
   After soaring 49.9 percent last year, the Standard &AMP; Poor's Drug
Index, a bellwether of industry stocks, has become one of Wall
Street's biggest chumps. Not only has the index trailed the anemic
0.48 percent gain of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index so far
this year, it has actually notched a negative 5.49 percent return.
</P>
<P>
   If that's not troubling enough, even the rockets of the
pharmaceutical industry have suddenly fallen to earth.
Warner-Lambert, which notched an 81.7 percent gain last year, has a
negative 10.9 percent return in 1999. And Pfizer _ remember Pfizer,
several business magazines' choice for company of the year in 1998?
_ now has a negative return of 6.8 percent, quite a turnaround from
last year's 67.6 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
   It's true, the year is still young, and three weeks of
performance does not a year make. But the drug stocks' woes
actually began in the fourth quarter last year. While the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 roared ahead 20.9 percent, the S&AMP;P Drug Index gained
only 13.95 percent.
</P>
<P>
   What's behind the stall? Analysts blame the slowdown on several
factors. Investors appear to be taking profits from drug holdings
and moving them into other sectors, particularly those less
expensive than drug stocks. Other investors appear to be leery
about the industry's blockbuster drugs that can hurt a stock at the
slightest mention of bad news.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, investors appeared to have ignored the lofty
price-to-earnings ratios of drug stocks _ Pfizer, for example,
currently sells at 68.9 times earnings, compared with 32.6 times
earnings for the S&AMP;P 500 _ but have now given the stock prices a
second look.
</P>
<P>
   After notching such huge returns, investors appear to be
wondering just how long the gains can last. And given the recent
potentially ominous headlines regarding some of the industry's most
profitable drugs _ notably Prozac, Eli Lilly's ubiquitous
anti-depressant, and Rezulin, Warner-Lambert's diabetes drug _
skittish investors, who have historically bought pharmaceutical
stocks, are beginning to bail out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sold all of my drug holdings around six months ago,'' said
Ken Heebner, a fund manager at CGM Capital Management. ``You just
look around at the drug companies, and it's hard to believe that
they are actually going to generate enough growth to justify the
cost. There are just too many other investment alternatives out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The move away from drug stocks comes as pharmaceutical companies
report their fourth-quarter and year-end earnings. Even though the
results are expected to be strong _ Warner-Lambert is expected to
report a 43 percent fourth-quarter gain next week _ most analysts
do not expect the stock slide to halt immediately.
</P>
<P>
   While it's common for investors to rotate the weight of their
portfolio from one stock sector to another, analysts believe
another phenomenon is hitting pharmaceuticals. The onslaught of
initial offerings of several Internet stocks _ which sometimes more
than triple in value in a day _ has created a microwave investing
strategy, or, in other words, an instantaneous fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Even though several drug stocks have produced large gains in a
single year _ Schering-Plough, for example, went up 77.9 percent in
1998 _ that is way too slow for some investors. Drug stocks have
historically delivered long-term consistent growth, a benefit that
may have fallen out of vogue in today's market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The growth rates in the pharmaceutical industry are superior
to that of many others,'' said Michael Mee, chief financial officer
of Bristol-Myers Squibb, generally regarded among industry's most
consistent performers. ``To some investors, pharmaceutical
companies may not be as attractive as the Internet stocks. But to
invest in them, the money has to come from somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The drug companies, though, may have themselves to blame for
some of their stock declines. Their use of consumer advertising to
create brand loyalty has been remarkably successful, but it has
added to the phenomenon of the blockbuster drug. All too often,
some analysts believe, investors have come to associate a
pharmaceutical company with only one drug and barter its stock
based on the performance of that product.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer, for example, reported a 42 percent gain in operating
income Tuesday, but the company's stock only increased 6.25 cents.
The trouble: Viagra, the company's wildly popular anti-impotence
pill, did not meet most analysts' expectations even though it had
$788 million in worldwide sales.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have become increasingly jittery about Lilly's patent
battle with Barr Laboratories over Prozac and Warner-Lambert's
upcoming meeting with the Food and Drug Administration over the
safety of Rezulin, its popular diabetes drug. The anxiety has
become so severe, analysts say, that investors have shied away from
the entire pharmaceutical sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these issues are making people nervous,'' said Ian
Sanderson, a managing director at Cowen &AMP; Co. ``Investors are
looking around for cheaper stocks, but the smaller cap companies
have been the big performers.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, an aggressive strategy may not be for all investors.
Analysts are confident that drug stocks will become popular again,
especially as they become cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``People invest in us for balanced, diversified strength,'' Mee
said, noting that Bristol-Myers manufacturers 65 products that each
have annual sales of $50 million or more. ``Some of these people
who are into the get-rich-quick routine may discover they get to go
to the poor house first. I haven't heard of a single Bristol-Myers
investor who bought shares to get rich overnight.''

SOME SENATORS VOW FIGHT IF U.S. SEEKS SHARE OF TOBACCO MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas, Wash., Fla.)   (af)  
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Several senators vowed Friday to protect the money
that their states won in lawsuits against the tobacco industry from
what they described as the Clinton administration's plan to seize a
share for the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The settlements belong to the states,'' said Sen. Kay Bailey
Hutchison, R-Texas. Ms. Hutchison has been one of the Senate's top
recipients of campaign contributions from the tobacco industry and
has consistently voted with the industry, including a vote to kill
last year's major anti-tobacco legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The settlements are supposed to help states pay for public
health costs, including those related to smoking. The
administration contends that these costs are largely borne by
Medicaid, of which the federal government pays 55 percent, so the
government is owed a proportionate share of the settlements.
</P>
<P>
   But Hutchison said the settlement involved more than just the
reimbursement of health expenses, so the federal government had no
claim to the money. And Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., said Friday that
because the federal government never helped the states win their
lawsuits, it was not entitled to any of the winnings.
</P>
<P>
   They were joined by various state officials, including Christine
Gregoire, attorney general of Washington state, who said the states
would countersue the federal government ``the first time a penny is
deducted'' from the states.
</P>
<P>
   Those settlements, and the federal government's assertion that
it is entitled to some of the money, are distinct from President
Clinton's announcement in his State of the Union address Tuesday
night that the Justice Department would sue tobacco companies to
recoup for the federal government a portion of the billions it has
paid for Medicare, the health care program for the elderly that is
entirely paid with federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Reed, the president's chief domestic policy adviser, said
Friday that the administration would be amenable to setting
guidelines for the states to spend the money for tobacco illnesses
and other public health causes.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison and Graham represent two of the states with the
biggest claim in the Medicaid settlements. Texas won about $17
billion and Florida about $11 billion. In Texas, the federal
government pays 62 cents of every dollar spent on Medicaid. In
Florida, it pays 55 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Both Hutchison and Graham tried unsuccessfully last year to slip
protections for the states' tobacco money into unrelated spending
bills and sought to keep the federal share to a minimum.

 &HT;    Teen `hack attack' prompts 'Net providers to take closer look at
security
 &HT;    By Lisa Perry
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Area Internet service providers are taking long,
hard looks at security software since authorities charged a
16-year-old Sidney boy for hacking into a Shelby County Internet
service provider earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby County sheriff's office and Sidney police continue to
investigate the case of 16-year-old Sidney boy who allegedly broke
into bright.net's router, downloaded unauthorized software, and
disrupted service to more than 3,000 bright.net customers Jan. 4
and 5.
</P>
<P>
   The teen was charged as a juvenile with felony vandalism and
felony misuse of computer property and was released to his parents.
Assistant Shelby County Prosecutor Andrew Berghausen said the
office has not decided whether to charge the suspect as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   Police reports indicate that during the investigation, the
Sidney High School junior told police he had discovered a program
that could shut down the system and and e-mailed them about it.
Police asked the boy if he had tried it, and police documents
indicated the youth replied that he had, but he also told police
that he sent bright.net ``a patch so they could fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bright.net Vice President Clint Conover said the service
interruption cost the company more than $17,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``That figure will probably climb to $20,000 by the time the
smoke clears,'' Conover said. The ``hack attack,'' as computer
professionals call what the teen did, also cost the company
intangibles, such as tying up technical support personnel across
Ohio when at least 200 bright.net customers called to question why
their service was stopped, Conover said.
</P>
<P>
   Police documents indicate that while the hack attack on
bright.net was successful, evidence was recovered at the teen's
home that could indicate WesNet in Piqua and Eri Net in Dayton
involvement. WesNet and Eri Net officials said they were not shut
down.
</P>
<P>
   WesNet, Eri Net, and bright.net had security software in place.
WesNet and bright.net had not previously experienced a successful
hack attack, according to Conover and Kyle Fincel, WesNet's chief
executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Fincel said that security at WesNet is an ongoing concern, and
was in place even before he learned of the Sidney teen's successful
hack attack on bright.net. Conover said additional security will be
considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The user name and password are the first levels of security,''
Fincel said. Software packages that WesNet uses also have security
built in, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eri Net general manager Ron Rose said that though his company
has experienced hack attacks before, the cost and time involved in
prosecuting attackers has been a deterrent to prosecution. Rose
said that though monetary losses through past hack attacks at Eri
Net do not equal bright.net's losses in the most recent hack
attack, hackers have stolen invaluable Eri Net data, including
customer lists.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are software packages specifically made to bring a
system down,'' Fincel said. ``Everybody connected to a network of
any type needs to take that into account. This is a very serious
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose said: ``Kids think there are no repercussions to this. This
is the thing we fight every day.''

ANGELS'   IMPEMBA HAS SENSE OF STYLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Last in an annual four-part series on the best and worst of Los
Angeles' sports media. Today: The play-by-play men.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Grow up a baseball fan in Los Angeles, it's Vin
Scully.
</P>
<P>
   Grow up a baseball fan in Detroit, it's Ernie Harwell.
</P>
<P>
   If you aspire to become a professional play-by-play man and end
up employed in an area in which the former walks on water, maybe
it's best to learn the game elsewhere. That way there's no worry
about copying a style everyone has already heard.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Impemba, who in a couple of months starts his fifth year
as the radio voice of the Angels, benefits from growing up in the
Midwest and starting his big-league career in Southern California.
It shows in his smooth, comfortable style, which has impressed many
of his peers in this market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to say so-and-so is the greatest broadcaster
because everyone has their own style, but Ernie had a terrific
influence on me in the way I approach things,'' said the
36-year-old Impemba, a Detroit native and Tigers fan for as long as
he can remember.
</P>
<P>
   And that style?
</P>
<P>
   ``Just be a regular guy,' said Impemba. ``I'd listen to him spin
tales of all his experiences, things he went through in his life. I
don't want to steal his phrases or speech patterns, but you take
the best from everyone you hear and develop your own way.''
</P>
<P>
   It's growing up in the Midwest, where as a self-proclaimed
``radio fiend,'' Impemba was able to pick up the radio calls from
Jack Brickhouse in Chicago and Jack Buck in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Midwest is just more laid back, and people tune into a
ballgame, especially baseball, when they want to hear
storytelling,'' said Impemba, who called baseball, basketball and
hockey while a Michigan State undergrad. ``Maybe you don't get that
in other parts of the country. But that's who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Angels had an opening for a second radio voice after
Billy Sample left as Bob Starr's partner in 1994, Impemba was
already on the team's short list of candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The year before, in the third of his four seasons calling games
for the Triple-A Tuscon Toros, Impemba sent the Angels a tape of
his work. When they called him, the Angels wanted him to interview
but also told him there were several network-quality guys they'd be
talking to, so the chances might not be very good.
</P>
<P>
   Within two weeks, Impemba had the job and a three-year deal.
Meaning his eight years of doing minor-league baseball in places
like Davenport, Iowa and Peoria, Ill., had finally paid off.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, Impemba says, he wondered if he'd ever be good enough
to have a big-league job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of fun in the minor leagues, but you wonder after
doing it for five or six years whether all this time you've put
into it, you're going to be crushed if it doesn't happen,'' said
Impemba. ``You start putting time limits on how long you're going
to stay in the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately the clock didn't run out on him. And the kid from
the Midwest _ whose only trip to Southern California was a visit to
Disneyland while he was working in Tucson _ soon got over his
culture shock.
</P>
<P>
   Impemba's placid style is the kind that network types often hear
and claim for themselves. But as far as he can tell, Impemba is
staying put with his wife, Cathy, and 3- and 5-year-old sons. He's
hesitant to give up his offseason family time for the sake of a
more high-profile career.
</P>
<P>
   In Southern California, there's already a pretty high profile,
where play-by-play men become legendary the longer they stay in
place. And Impemba has no illusions of being mentioned with the
Scullys of the business.
</P>
<P>
   But if you haven't done so yet, just settle back on a summer
night and listen to Impemba call a game on the radio (the Angels
just moved to KLAC-AM). Or even better, now that the Angels have an
expanded spring-training broadcast schedule, try him out in March.
</P>
<P>
   He's so good at what he does, you may even start to take him for
granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question this has been a great town for
broadcasters,'' said Impemba. ``I can't think about how much
publicity I do or don't get. And if I try to measure up to someone
like Vin Scully, I'm in trouble quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best advice I got from anyone when I came here was to
don't change anything. The worst thing is to become someone you're
not. I've followed that.''
</P>
<P>
   And for that, Southern California baseball fans are very
thankful.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
BEST AND WORST &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE TOP 10
</P>
<P>
   1. Chick Hearn, Lakers TV and radio: Based on his work so far
this season. &QL; 
2. Vin Scully, Dodgers TV and radio: From an issue of ESPN The
Magazine last July on ``99 ways to live the life of the ultimate
fan,'' this one came in at No.72: ``Listen to Vin call a ballgame
on the radio. He is so smooth, so humble that he brings integrity
to, of all places, Los Angeles.'' Thanks. We think. The question
around this Hall of Famer is whether he'll be content now that
Peter O'Malley has left the building. As long as the Fox suits
leave him alone _ let him do his 100 games a year and don't push
him into doing promos for ``Ally McBeal'' _ he'll stay past his
50th season next year. Fox would be shooting itself between the
eyes if it crossed him and forced his ouster. &QL; 
3. Bob Miller, Kings TV: Starting his second quarter century with
the team, he'll have his Kings Court of Fame plaque up at the
Staples Center soon enough. &QL; 
4. Mario Impemba, Angels radio: All you could want in a baseball
play-by-play call. It's that simple. &QL; 
5. Ross Porter, Dodgers TV and radio: Can you break down that Kevin
Brown contract, please? &QL; 
6. Chris Roberts, UCLA football and basketball radio: The way he
handled analyst Billy Ray Smith on the football broadcasts brought
us new appreciation for a guy who's always had the voice but
usually sugarcoated things so much it was tough to listen without
developing a toothache. Roberts does sound like he's truly enjoying
himself during a broadcast, and that has to count. &QL; 
7. Nick Nickson, Kings radio: For the record: His call on Luc
Robitaille's 500th career goal is the only one Los Angeles heard _
the game wasn't on TV by some scheduling fluke. But, best of all,
since the team's move to KRLA we always look forward to Kings radio
broadcasts _ they pre-empt G. Gordon Liddy. &QL; 
8. Bill Macdonald, UCLA basketball TV: Over 20 billion jobs served
at Fox Sports West. And he keeps 'em all straight somehow. &QL; 
9. Rory Markas, USC basketball radio: Has finally escaped Clippers
hell. Congrats. &QL; 
10. Jamie Jarrin, Dodgers Spanish-language radio: OK, so I have no
idea what he's saying, but the guy's in the Hall of Fame for cryin'
out loud. (And you know what: He'll tell you that his English is
good enough, but he could do a game in his other language better
than some of his counterparts). &QL; 
Honorable mention: Jim Watson, Fox Sports West 2 high school
football and basketball; Al Epstein, Pepperdine basketball radio;
Lou Riggs, UCLA volleyball radio; Steve Physioc, Angels TV (sure,
but can he handle Rex Hudler?); Rick DeReyes, Jethawks radio (the
dream job continues); Fernando Gonzalez, Lakers Spanish-language
radio (although he's never confused Travis Knight for Travis Grant,
he often drops the ``H'' in Robert Horry). &QL; 
!hair!
</P>
<P>
   THE BOTTOM FIVE &QC; 
!hair!
</P>
<P>
   1. Ralph Lawler, Clippers TV: Based on his work so far this
season. (And by the way: It continues to astound us that his two
catch phrases _ ``Bingo!'' and ``Fasten your seat belts!'' _ are
used to describe a Clippers game that are actually in progress. If
Lawler had only two catch phrases, you'd think they'd be something
like: ``Clippers take another 20,'' or ``We'll get 'em next
time!'') &QL; 
2. Rick Monday, Dodgers radio: Don't take our word for it. In the
New Times' 1998 Guide to the Best of Los Angeles last summer,
Monday was voted ``Best Reason for the Dodgers to Change
Announcers.'' Their review: ``His basso-buffoondo delivery has been
bad enough for far too long.... the water-torture quality of
Monday's broadcasts (is) a collection of obtuse non-sequiturs,
moldy platitudes and insipid observations delivered with that kind
of former ballplayer's overconfidence that comes from signing too
many autographs and using too much hair spray.'' Bingo! &QL; 
3. Chris Madsen, Ducks TV: Mute, please. And a little Velcro for
the 'do. &QL; 
4. Lee Hamilton, USC football radio: He's no Milo Hamilton, but
there's always the option to change his name to that if he wanted.
At least ``Hacksaw'' (his real nickname) didn't use the phrase
``dammit'' during the Trojans' loss in the Sun Bowl. &QL; 
5. Tom Kelly, USC football and basketball TV: It's been said he's
such a pro he could do a game in his sleep. And he often does. &QL; 
Horrible mention: Brian Hamilton, Ducks radio; Brian Barnhart,
Angels radio (great first-year pipes, but he sounds more like he
should steer toward a career as a public address announcer). &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: NEW SEASON'S THEME: NAUGHTY AND NICE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The curtain finally lifted Thursday on
the pro basketball season, and rehearsals began locally for what
promises to be a most fascinating morality play. Here at their new
practice facility, the New Jersey Nets re-introduced Jayson
Williams and his troupe of dribbling straight men in the light of
the afternoon, while up at the New York Knicks' training base in
Purchase, N.Y., reporters were kept waiting long after dark.
</P>
<P>
   Nice Nets. Naughty Knicks. A hastily arranged theme for a
long-delayed season. This may be a sweeping generalization, but, to
paraphrase one recently retired icon, if the basketball shoe fits,
don't hesitate to endorse it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a time when the good guy won out,'' said Lewis Katz,
one of the Nets' new owners, in making the official announcement on
Williams' new $100 million contract. ``He deserved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unintentional or not, this was the first shot of the 1999 season
and here is the sweet, familiar sound that it made: swish. The
Knicks, we were implicitly reminded, have no moral moral high
ground to stand on as they welcome Latrell Sprewell into their
midst.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, they desperately want to win the championship, and
they had as much right to bring Sprewell in as Sprewell has to get
on with his career. There is no argument about that, but, let's be
honest, Sprewell did not just have a bad day last year when he
choked his coach. He clearly has some anger management issues and
the Knicks were not exactly the basketball Love Boat in the first
place. On paper, Sprewell makes them better, flashier, but before
we vault them right into the National Basketball Association
finals, let's try not to forget what happened the last time, two
years ago, this team pumped itself up with heralded personnel.
</P>
<P>
   (Some hints: Heat, fight, bench, sit.) At the serious playoff
level, collective character counts, and it helps to have a composed
leader, too.
</P>
<P>
   When I mentioned this Thursday to one Knick official, he
thankfully didn't try to sell me on Patrick Ewing, and instead
zeroed in on Charlie Ward. It could be that Ward, with a rich, new
contract, will assume that role, but these days, the leader must
have status, and who can forget Magic Johnson _ I mean Mark Jackson
_ obliterating Ward in the low post during the playoffs last May?
</P>
<P>
   Until they prove otherwise, the Knicks are an intriguing bunch,
with obvious deficiencies, extra baggage and the potential to break
down like the dysfunctional family on ``Married With Children.''
That is the low-brow sit-com on the network of Rupert Murdoch, who
just happens to be a significant investor in the cable conglomerate
that owns the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the new season's theme, we should note that the
Knicks are operated by ratings-driven television mega-moguls who
don't care what you're watching, as long as you watch it.
Meanwhile, back across the Hudson, the Nets' new bosses, Katz and
Finn Wentworth, are projecting a different prime-time image after
enticing Katz's college friend, Bill Cosby, into their ownership
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Community, character, championship,'' Wentworth said, burying
another jumper against the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   The wealthy real estate developers envision an arena in Newark,
where their team can help in the city's revitalization, where they
can also build luxury suites and make more money, 40 percent of it
already pledged to inner city kids. ``This is not just about
winning,'' Katz said. ``Winning is important but there should be
more to this than just walking around and saying, `We won.' If you
can use the profile of a sports team to do some social good, why
not? And if you expect if of the players, why shouldn't the owners
be role models for them?''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Katz was back in his hometown, the blighted
Camden, where he recently bought his old synagogue, vacant, to use
for a Boys and Girls Club. He beamed when Williams announced a
$20,000 donation to the lockout-stricken Meadowlands concession
workers. Williams can afford it, after Keith Van Horn called Coach
John Calipari to suggest, in no uncertain terms, that it would be
most unwise to low-ball his buddy.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of loyalty is where real team character begins, and
while having it doesn't guarantee you'll win, not having it makes
it pretty much certain you won't. Keep that in mind as you watch
Jeff van Gundy tip-toe through the Knicks' emotional minefield,
while Calipari tries to shout his young Nets toward the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to thank _ hold your breath on this one _ Billy
Martin,'' Williams said, gesturing at Calipari. ``And I'm Reggie
Jackson.''
</P>
<P>
   Realistically, that is another potential, but unCosby-like
season story line. Stay tuned.

FDA WARNS A DIETARY SUPPLEMENT CAN INDUCE COMAS OR DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla.)   (af)  
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A product that is supposed to build muscles,
enhance love-making abilities and help one get a good night's sleep
can induce comas or even death, the Food and Drug Administration
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The agency warned people not to buy or consume the product,
which is sold in some gymnasiums and health-food stores and is
available on the Internet. It is marketed under various names,
including Revivarant, Blue Nitro, GH Revitalizer, Gamma G and
Remforce, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really want to get out a clear warning to consumers that
this is a dangerous product, and they should not be using it,'' Joe
Levitt, the FDA's director of food safety, said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said the product under its several names contained
gamma butyrolactone, or GBL, a chemical that when taken orally is
converted in the body to gamma hydroxybutyrate. The latter is a
potent drug that is being tested for possible use in treating
narcolepsy, or attacks of abnormally deep sleep, but which has
serious side effects, the FDA said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said a woman was found dead in her home after taking
GBL. Dozens of other users suffered severe effects, including
several who became unconscious or comatose. Others reported
seizures, vomiting and slower breathing and heart rates, the agency
said.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA said the products containing GBL are sold in liquid and
powder form. The agency said it is asking the companies that
manufacture them to voluntarily recall them. If they do not comply,
the agency will consider ``all potential regulatory actions at its
disposal,'' it said in a statement Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
   One manufacturer, Trimfast Group of Florida, has already agreed
to recall its products, sold under several Revivarant designations,
the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   While labeled as dietary supplements, the products are actually
``illegally marketed, unapproved new drugs,'' the agency said. The
FDA said it and the Justice Department are also investigating
possible illegal use of GHB, the powerful chemical cousin of GBL
that may have use in treating sleep problems.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the FDA discovered that some laboratories were
illicitly producing the odorless, tasteless GHB, which has
occasionally been in vogue as a ``party drug,'' the agency said. It
has been linked to three deaths, dozens of hospitalizations and
instances of ``date rape'' in which women were rendered helpless
after downing GHB-laced drinks, the FDA said.
</P>
<P>
   The text of the FDA's warning, which cites an immediate health
threat, contrasts starkly with advertisements for the products in
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Revivarant is a dietary supplement that helps add to your
quality of life,'' the Sports Nutrition Warehouse boasts on its Web
site. ``Its main ingredient is a compound found naturally in the
body.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad says Revivarant promotes better sleep, better muscles and
``better performance and heightened pleasure'' during sex.

OFFICIALS SEIZE NEARLY 5 TONS OF COCAINE IN RECORD BUST IN TEXAS

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Federal authorities seized a Panamanian-flag cargo
vessel with nearly five tons of cocaine in it in what officials
Thursday called the largest cocaine bust ever in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The ship, docked at the Port of Houston, was under heavy guard.
</P>
<P>
   A Coast Guard search team found the cocaine during a routine
search at sea 125 miles south of Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   The ship reached Houston on Wednesday and was unloaded Thursday
as agents in heavy assault gear and carrying submachine guns
patrolled the area.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Slater, secretary of Transportation, said the bust is the
largest cocaine seizure in Texas and one of the 10 largest in the
nation. He estimated the cocaine's street value at $186 million.
</P>
<P>
   The motor vessel Cannes has been detained, and the Greek master
and four crew members are under arrest, Slater said. The other 19
crewmen are being questioned. The crew includes several
nationalities, but most are Ukrainian, a Coast Guard official said.
</P>
<P>
   The 580-foot Cannes was also carrying 26,000 metric tons of iron
ore, believed to have been loaded in Brazil for transport to
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The ship's last port of call before being boarded was Punta
Buera, Trinidad, on Jan. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Lee Brown, a former drug czar in the Clinton
administration, said the seizure sends a message to shippers that
the United States has zero tolerance ``against those who wish to
destroy our children.''
</P>
<P>
   The size of the shipment, he said, indicates there have been
previous shipments. ``Those who traffic in drugs would not send
that much on their first shipment,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard Commandant Adm. James M. Loy said a patrol plane
spotted the ship and guided a U.S. Navy patrol boat to the scene,
which officials described as a routine search.
</P>
<P>
   A Coast Guard team aboard the Navy boat was granted permission
to inspect the Cannes, Loy said.
</P>
<P>
   The team found indications that something might be hidden aboard
and called in search specialists who found the cocaine in bales
buried beneath five feet of iron ore.
</P>
<P>
   The Panamanian government then gave permission for Coast Guard
officials to enforce all applicable U.S. laws. The Customs Service
and the Drug Enforcement Administration will investigate the source
of the drugs and to whom they were bound.
</P>
<P>
   Loy said one of the Coast Guard's challenges is ``to extend our
borders as far away as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   International agreements allow such searches on the open sea, he
said, and had the Cannes captain refused, permission would have
been sought from the Panamanian government, which cooperates in
such matters.
</P>
<P>
   Loy said about 70 percent of all drugs comes into this country
across its Southwest borders and much of this comes by sea.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Cmdr. Peter Brown and Petty Officer James Sorenson, who
searched the Cannes, said they look for anything out of the
ordinary, such as new repairs on an old vessel, which might
indicate something is hidden behind the new surface.
</P>
<P>
   Searching the Cannes turned up no new repairs, but Brown said
there was evidence of activity in the No. 2 hold after its cargo
was loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said the passageway to the hold was clear, while
passageways to the other holds were choked with boxes, barrels and
trash. There were tracks _ iron ore is quite dusty _ indicating
someone had been in the hold.
</P>
<P>
   With these signs to guide them, Brown said, the searchers began
probing the hold full of ore with rods and eventually hit something
``that did not feel like iron ore.'' Digging revealed a large stack
of bales of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said the vessel's crew cooperated throughout the search
and the voyage on to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   National Guardsmen loaded the cocaine here into two large,
sealed trucks for removal from the dock.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Rimmer, director of the Port of Houston, said the cocaine
will be tested and stored in a secure location until the Department
of Justice decides how much to retain for evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder will be burned in an incinerator that will
vaporize the drug, leaving no residue, Rimmer said.

PARTY HEADQUARTERS COPE WITH IMPEACHMENT

   PHOENIX _ Given that the head of their party is in such hot
water, you'd think that local Democratic party officials would be
grimacing and squirming with every phone call to their office.
</P>
<P>
   But an unannounced visit to their county and state headquarters
paints a different picture. Confidence courses through its
corridors. Life is good.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this response when a reporter asks a man with
slicked-back hair how the state group is weathering the national
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, everything is fine in here. We have one person at lunch
and I'm about to go to lunch,'' Cortland Coleman replies curtly,
clasping his hands like a used-car salesman. ``So, not much here
today.''
</P>
<P>
   The lone television set is turned off. No one is watching as the
president's lawyers defend him back in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; There's no sign of a presidential scandal in the Maricopa
County office either.
</P>
<P>
   As they prepare raffle tickets for a fundraiser, the three women
in the office note that many of the people who call them are
Republicans who want to switch parties. In fact, they say, every
day about three or four Republicans call asking to switch parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be really interesting to see if the party
numbers change,'' says Vickie Ehst, the office administrator, who
is off to the post office to mail about six manila folders with new
registration forms.
</P>
<P>
   News of the party switchers pleases Linda Calvert, head of the
county office.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no stronger Democrat than a former Republican. I
should know,'' she says, ``I was a Republican'' eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Life is good? Their president has been impeached. He's facing
the first impeachment trial in 131 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every now and then, you get someone who wants to complain
about the president,'' admits Pam Bryson, office administrator for
the state Democratic Party headquarters. ``We let them vent.''
</P>
<P>
   Could things be different at the Republican camp?
</P>
<P>
   My visit there catches them enjoying a takeout Chinese feast.
</P>
<P>
   When I ask about what their constituents are saying, the
Repubican Party executive director worries instead about a
photographer snapping shots of their banquet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to take a picture of this right?'' asks Jane
Lynch. ``We don't want a picture of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Convinced that the photographic situation is under control, she
turns to answering questions:
</P>
<P>
   ``Not too many people are calling the office.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People who call us are not exactly Clinton supporters. They're
a bit upset about what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one likes to see our country going through this. I'm sure
the Senate will handle this in a manner that is best for the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we haven't been getting phone calls from people who want
to change parties.''
</P>
<P>
   At that, finance director Todd Bradford offers: ``We had someone
call last Friday who wanted to switch parties.''
</P>
<P>
   However, in a office papered with election posters _ including
one that boasts, ``I love Newt' _ Chris Dahm seems to have a better
gauge on the situation.
</P>
<P>
   With a pile of mail in his lap, Dahm talks about the phone calls
that ebb and flow with the action on CNN. The hotter the
discussion, the greater the phone calls, explains Dahm, special
assistant to the state party chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to work for (Gov. Fife) Symington,'' he says, adding
that he's accustomed to taking the heat. He says after President
Clinton's State of the Union address, some Republicans called to
complain that their lawmakers seemed to be sleeping through the
speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``What am I suppose to say? I didn't watch it on TV. I read the
speech. I have a life. I was shooting hoops that day.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As President Clinton's impeachment trial progresses, Julie
Amparano will be taking the pulse of people in the Valley. Do they
care about President Clinton's trial? Do they want him removed from
office? What does captivate Americans? She looks for the answers.

CORRUPTION IS EXTENSIVE, IOC OFFICIAL FINDS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A senior official of the International Olympic
Committee acknowledged Thursday that corruption in the Salt Lake
City bribery scandal was extensive and that the expulsion of some
members of the committee would be sought this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Cash payments and other lavish benefits perhaps exceeding
three-quarters of a million dollars _ including more than $100,000
apiece to some IOC members _ were provided to more than a dozen
members over a period of six years during and after Salt Lake
City's bid on the 2002 Winter Games, said Richard Pound, a Montreal
lawyer who is heading the IOC investigation.
</P>
<P>
   While saying that he did not believe the inappropriate conduct
of Salt Lake City and IOC members rose to a criminal level, Pound
apologized to Salt Lake residents, athletes and nervous corporate
sponsors for what has become a severe tarnishing of the Olympic
ideal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have found evidence of very disappointing conduct by a
number of IOC members,'' Pound said. He added: ``Their conduct has
been completely contrary to everything the Olympic movement has
worked so hard to represent.''
</P>
<P>
   While reports of wrongdoing have swirled for weeks, Pound
offered the most detailed explanation yet by the IOC of the scope
of the scandal, as well as an acknowledgment that improper bidding
procedures have occurred for years.
</P>
<P>
   Pound will deliver a report of his investigation this weekend at
IOC headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland. Before he does, a dozen
members accused of wrongdoing will be given a chance to defend
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   While Pound's report will deal only with the Salt Lake City
scandal, he said the IOC would expand its investigation to include
every city that has bid on the Winter or Summer Games between 1996
and 2006.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make sense to think Salt Lake is the first and only
time this happened,'' Pound said.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech at the International Sport Summit in midtown
Manhattan, and in later interviews, Pound spoke of the urgent need
to reform the process by which the Games are awarded. He proposed
prohibiting IOC members from visiting cities bidding on the Winter
and Summer Games. But he also said that all 113 current members,
and not a smaller group, should continue to vote on awarding the
Games.
</P>
<P>
   During their allotted three-day visits, IOC members are treated
to first-class airfare, luxury hotels, extensive wining and dining
and exorbitant favors by officials seeking to secure the Olympics.
Salt Lake City officials have acknowledged providing cash payments,
medical treatment, tuition aid and such expensive presents as
shotguns and skis to IOC members and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Suggesting that a special code of ethics could be implemented
for IOC members, or a standing commission to deal with ethical
breaches, Pound said, ``We will do whatever is necessary to ensure
that IOC members are held to the highest standards.''
</P>
<P>
   While a growing number of people have been calling for the
resignation of Juan Antonio Samaranch, the president of the IOC,
Pound praised Samaranch's ``extraordinary vision and leadership''
in making the Olympic movement financially secure, steering it
through the boycotts of the 1980s and extending its reach to 200
countries worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Samaranch has an enormous amount of experience in
managing the IOC through both good and bad times,'' Pound said.
``Right now, we need that stability more than ever. No one is more
determined to correct this situation than he is.''
</P>
<P>
   A swimmer in the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, the 56-year-old
Pound has been an IOC member since 1978. He is a vice president of
the committee and is influential as its chief negotiator of
television contracts, one of the IOC's prime sources of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Pound said that no evidence has been uncovered suggesting that
votes had been directly exchanged for money or favors in Salt Lake
City, which he said won the Games on merit. He also said that it
appeared that nothing beyond justifiable consulting fees had been
paid to so-called agents or middlemen _ people who serve as
liaisons between bidding cities and IOC members _ but that the
agents had not been interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that an investigation by the U.S. Department of
Justice will ultimately determine whether criminal charges will be
filed, Pound said he did not believe any laws had been broken in
the Salt Lake City scandal.
</P>
<P>
   He said he believed that Salt Lake City Olympic officials had
been excessively eager to become part of the ``Olympic family'' and
that ``families help each other.'' He said the improprieties began
in late 1991 and some continued beyond June 1995 when Salt Lake
City won the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's wrong on our side is that nobody should ask for help,
and even if help is offered, you have to say, `It's really great
but I cannot accept it,''' Pound said. ``Even if it's genuine
friendship, it has arisen in an Olympic context.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Pound said that his report would not implicate 16 IOC members,
the number mentioned in a memorandum that he authored and that was
obtained earlier this week by The Wall Street Journal. He did not
dispute comments by Samaranch that 13 members have been sent
letters asking them to explain their actions. One member, Pirjo
Haeggman of Finland, has resigned. Other expulsions will be sought
this weekend, Pound said, when his report is presented to the
executive board of the IOC. It is up to the 11-member executive
board to carry out the recommendations in Pound's report.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic officials have identified the other IOC officials linked
to the Salt Lake City scandal as Agustin Arroyo of Ecuador, Bashir
Attarabulsi of Libya, Zen El Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir of Sudan,
Jean-Claude Ganga of Congo Republic, Anton Geesink of the
Netherlands, Louis Guirandou-N'Diaye of Ivory Coast, Lamine Keita
of Mali, Kim Un Yong of South Korea, Charles Mukora of Kenya,
Sergio Santander Fantini of Chile, David Sibandze of Swaziland and
Vitaly Smirnov of Russia.

CLINTON DEFENSE LEAVES SENATE SHARPLY DIVIDED ON NEXT MOVE

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the White House wrapped up its three-day case
Thursday, Senate Republicans and Democrats agreed that President
Clinton's lawyers had mounted a strong defense, but they remained
divided over whether they needed to hear more evidence before
voting on the impeachment articles.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats insisted that the White House's legal assault had
punched big holes in the House prosecutors' case, and they
continued to press Republicans to skip a scheduled vote early next
week to depose witnesses and vote instead on acquittal or
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know the votes aren't there, so why drag it out?'' said
Sen. John Breaux, D-La.
</P>
<P>
   But many Senate Republicans, who support calling witnesses to
clear up conflicting testimony, urged their colleagues to withhold
judgment on witnesses at least until the next phase of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning on Friday, Democrats and Republicans will divide up to
16 hours to question the White House lawyers and House prosecutors
for the first time. Senate Republicans and Democrats have been
collecting and organizing questions. Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist will read each one, identifying its author.
</P>
<P>
   ``The White House has good lawyers and they scored some
points,'' said Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., whose brother, Asa, is
one of the House prosecutors. ``Now everyone is looking forward to
the question-and-answer time, when it'll give the House an
opportunity to do some rebuttal.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the lead prosecutor, complained
Thursday that the managers had been given no chance to rebut the
White House's defense. ``The last one to speak always has the
advantage,'' said Hyde, who said he sensed growing support among
senators for summoning witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said the prosecutors had not decided on a final list of
witnesses, although he has called for bringing Monica Lewinsky,
Betty Currie and Vernon Jordan Jr. Hyde said the prosecutors would
decide whether to seek any witnesses to testify in the trial after
reviewing their depositions.
</P>
<P>
   With opening statements from both sides now complete, the
situation remains remarkably fluid. Democrats and Republicans are
talking among themselves about whether to dismiss the case and
which, if any, witnesses are needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of flux and a lot of movement and a lot of talk
and groping toward a bipartisan solution,'' said Sen. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Republicans know the trial is unpopular with Americans.
Clinton's job approval ratings rose after his State of the Union
address on Tuesday night, ranging from 66 percent in an ABC poll to
72 percent in a CBS survey to 76 percent according to NBC.
</P>
<P>
   But many Republicans say they must push ahead with their solemn
duty and not be swayed by opinion polls. Moreover, they add, it's
natural that Democrats would try to seize on the momentum from the
White House's defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prosecution presented their case and everyone said, `Oh,
OK,''' said Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, a former county prosecutor.
``Then the defense presented their case. Everybody said, `Oh, OK.'
This is a natural rhythm to a trial, and we're into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Both parties say the momentum could shift again after the
questioning starts. Democrats and Republicans have each collected
dozens of queries from senators. Each side will alternate asking
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, there are conflicts in what has been said by the
House managers and the White House,'' Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the
majority leader, told reporters after Thursday's arguments. ``There
appear to be conflicts between what the witnesses have said. This
is an important part of the process as we try to clarify the
disputes.''
</P>
<P>
   The questions will delve into both the perjury and obstruction
of justice charges. Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., said Clinton's
lawyers had raised ``reasonable doubts'' about whether the
president could be convicted.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith said he was still troubled by certain details. ``How
many interns in the White House would the president, Vernon Jordan
and Betty Currie find a good job for on an expedited basis?'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   After the questioning, the Senate is set to vote on whether to
dismiss the case, perhaps as early as Monday. Senate Republicans
outnumber Democrats, 55-45, so six Republicans would have to defect
and all Democrats would have to hold firm to dump the case.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides say outright dismissal is unlikely. So Democrats are
eyeing the next vote, to depose witnesses, as a proxy for
dismissal. Senators say the outcome of that vote is less certain.
But even if it fails, Democrats say it carries political potency
for them because they can accuse Republicans of dragging out a
trial that is unpopular with the public.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear how many Republicans are uneasy about calling
witnesses. Some Republicans, including Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine,
voiced concerns at a party caucus Thursday morning about the impact
of a lengthy deposition process.
</P>
<P>
   But many Republicans rejected the idea of bypassing a vote on
witnesses. ``To do anything that would abridge the process of
getting to the truth or to arbitrarily cut short that process
because it's inconvenient, is unwise,'' said Sen. Chuck Hagel,
R-Neb.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing ahead with depositions, knowing that senators will have
a second vote on which, if any, witnesses actually testify at the
trial, still carries risks of prolonging the trial, lawmakers
conceded.
</P>
<P>
   ``This train,'' said Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont., ``may not have
no brakes.''

FOREST SERVICE EMPLOYEES PETITION AGAINST LOGGING 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.M., Mont., Wash)   By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hundreds of U.S. Forest Service employees have
signed an e-mail petition calling for strict limits on logging in
the pristine back country of the national forests.
</P>
<P>
   The petition comes just as the chief of the service, Michael
Dombeck, a Clinton administration appointee, is nearing a decision
on a hotly debated new approach governing forests where there are
no roads for logging. The policy is expected to make millions of
acres of roadless areas off-limits to logging trucks, to close some
existing roads and to otherwise restrict logging on some
environmentally sensitive lands. But environmental advocates have
argued that the administration's proposals do not go far enough.
</P>
<P>
   The petition supporting stricter limits was circulated this
month by the Association of Forest Service Employees for
Environmental Ethics, a private group that is often critical of
official forestry policies. Some agency supervisors warned
employees that they risked disciplinary action if they used
government computers or e-mail accounts to sign the petition.
</P>
<P>
   But this week, Dombeck wrote to all the employees to say that
they had broken no rules. ``I support the open and frank exchange
of views and ideas and truly appreciate hearing what my employees
have to say about these and all other Forest Service issues and
proposals,'' Dombeck wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The hubbub was a reminder of a long-standing rift within the
agency over the management of the nation's forests. Traditionalists
in the service tend to support logging, while a new breed of
forestry professionals are more inclined to make untouched lands
off-limits.
</P>
<P>
   The petitioners said they were ``deeply concerned about road
management and the protection of unroaded areas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We support a thorough inventory of existing roads, coupled to
your proposal to close, upgrade or obliterate those roads that are
too expensive to maintain or are causing unacceptable natural
resource damage,'' their petition said. ``We also support the
protection of unroaded areas that are critically important as
habitat for wildlife and fish and as sources of clean water for our
communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Andy Stahl, the executive director of the employees group, said
more than 500 employees had signed so far.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The employee group programmed its computers to prowl the
agency's Web sites and find the e-mail addresses of 27,000 service
employees, to whom the petition was sent.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisors in the Wenatchee and Gifford Pinchot National
Forests, both in Washington state; the Lolo National Forest in
Montana and the Santa Fe National Forest in New Mexico, among
others, had warned employees that they were forbidden to use
government e-mail for such purposes and that they could be punished
for doing so. Employees were encouraged to refuse to sign the
petition and to ask that they not be contacted in this way again.

BUMPERS URGES SENATE NOT TO REMOVE CLINTON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an emotional appeal that riveted senators,
retired Sen. Dale Bumpers of Arkansas called on his former
colleagues Thursday not to remove President Clinton, saying it
would set a precedent from which the nation might never recover.
</P>
<P>
   In a folksy style, combining humor with a reverence for the
Constitution, the Arkansas Democrat said that while Clinton's
effort to hide his involvement with Monica Lewinsky was
``unforgivable'' and ``shameless,'' it did not rise to the kind of
high crimes and misdemeanors the nation's founders envisioned for
impeachment of a president.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the definition of the offenses for which a president
can be impeached was taken from old English laws referring to
``political crimes against the state,'' Bumpers argued that the
charges of perjury and obstruction of justice as outlined in two
House articles of impeachment against Clinton do ``not even come
close'' to that definition.
</P>
<P>
   ``If ... it had to be a crime against society or a breach of the
public trust, what are we doing here?,'' asked Bumpers, who retired
from the Senate last fall after 24 years. ``So, colleagues, if you
honor the Constitution ... you can censure Bill Clinton, you can
hand him over to the prosecutor for him to be prosecuted, but you
cannot convict him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bumpers also called on his Senate friends to heed not only the
words of the country's founding fathers, but the wishes of the
public. Citing recent opinion polls, he said the American people
are ``asking for an end to this nightmare.'' He called on the
senators to, as President Harry Truman once told him, ``put your
trust in the people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you vote to convict, in my opinion you're going to be
creating more havoc than (Clinton) could ever possibly create. For
God's sake, don't heighten people's alienation that is at an
all-time high toward their government,'' Bumpers pleaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people have a right and they are calling on you to rise
above politics, rise above partisanship. They're calling on you to
do your solemn duty, and I pray you will.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement by Bumpers wrapped up the White House defense of
Clinton, which focused a meticulous and unrelenting attack on the
facts in the case as presented by the all-Republican House
prosecution team last week.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Bumpers, the senators also heard several White
House lawyers pick at the prosecutors' charges that Clinton not
only lied under oath about his sexual relationship with Lewinsky,
but orchestrated a ``sinister'' plot to cover it up by tampering
with witnesses and trying to buy the young woman's silence by
finding her a job in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Where the prosecutors saw an illegal scheme aimed at undermining
the rule of law, Clinton's defense team saw, as one of the
president's lawyers put it, a stupid but innocent attempt to hide
an affair with a young, former White House intern from his family
and the American people. Bumpers also cited ``a five-year,
relentless, unending investigation of the president'' that had
yielded nothing until the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all of those years and $50 million of Whitewater,
Travelgate, Filegate, you name it ... the president was found
guilty of nothing,'' he said. ``You're here today because the
president suffered a terrible moral lapse.''
</P>
<P>
   Bumpers characterized the Lewinsky matter as ``a breach of his
family trust'' and a ``sex scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   Mentioning what he called the forgotten ``human element'' in the
case, Bumpers cited the embarrassment that Clinton's actions had
inflicted on first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and his daughter,
Chelsea. But although he described the scandal as a
``self-inflicted'' wound, he chastised Republicans for their lack
of compassion and ``unnecessarily harsh and pejorative
descriptions'' of what Clinton had done in order to build their
impeachment case against him.
</P>
<P>
   He said Clinton had already been punished enough, noting that
the relationship ``between husband and wife, father and child has
been incredibly strained, if not destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is easily the most important vote you will ever cast,''
he continued. ``If you have difficulty because of an intense
dislike of the president _ and that's understandable _ rise above
it. He is not the issue. He will be gone (in two years). You won't.
So don't leave a precedent from which we may never recover and
almost surely will regret.''
</P>
<P>
   Bumpers made his appeal to the Senate exactly one year after
Clinton's relationship with Lewinsky was first disclosed in a
report by The Washington Post, and it ended the first phase of the
Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   Both the defense and prosecution teams were given three days
each to present their cases. Friday and Saturday, senators will be
given a chance to ask questions through Chief Justice William
Rehnquist who is presiding over the first impeachment trial of a
president since 1868.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he was hopeful
that the question-and-answer phase of the trial would be wrapped up
Saturday so senators could begin considering early next week
whether to allow the appearance of witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats appeared Thursday to harden their line against
witnesses, saying that they will try to introduce a motion to
dismiss the House charges against Clinton as early as Monday.
Failing that, Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said he hopes to work out an
agreement with some Republicans who might be ``sympathetic'' to
wrapping up the case without engaging in a long witness phase that
could prolong the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., for one, said that he had been
impressed enough by the White House defense arguments to question
whether witnesses would add anything new to the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might not need witnesses,'' he said, adding that he has
doubts about dragging the trial out much past next week.
</P>
<P>
   But other Republicans, such as Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island,
said they believe witnesses ought to be called if House prosecutors
believe they are important to presenting a complete case to the
Senate. Still, he said senators would have to ``be tough'' on the
House Republicans so they don't try to bring ``every Tom, Dick and
Harry'' before the Senate just to reinforce facts that already are
clear.
</P>
<P>
   House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., appealed
to the Senate on Thursday evening not to ``short circuit'' the
prosecution team's effort to fully present its case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a long way from closing the book on this,'' he said,
insisting that Senate testimony from witnesses such as Lewinsky
would help bolster prosecutors' arguments for why Clinton should be
removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Hyde sat in the Senate chamber listening
intently as Clinton's private attorney David Kendall ripped into
the House prosecutors' case, sometimes using their own arguments
and the testimony from witnesses such as Lewinsky to examine it
point-by-point.
</P>
<P>
   In his presentation, Kendall accused prosecutors of ignoring
evidence that exonerates the president in their determined drive
``to fit some of the facts into a sinister pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence is, at best, profoundly ambiguous,'' Kendall
said, citing testimony and other information to dispute the
allegations that Clinton tried to get Lewinsky to lie about their
relationship and to ensure her silence by finding a job for her.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, he said the prosecutors had simply ignored the
most important piece of testimony of all _ Lewinsky's.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ever asked me to lie and no one ever offered me a job
for my silence,'' he quoted Lewinsky as telling federal grand
jurors. ``Is there something difficult to understand here?'' he
asked.
</P>
<P>
   He also accused the House prosecutors of ignoring the fact that
Lewinsky began her discussions with Clinton friend Vernon Jordan
about finding a job in New York weeks before her name turned up on
a witness list in the Paul Jones sexual harassment lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors have said repeatedly that the job search was
triggered by Lewinsky being named as a possible witness in the
Jones case. But Kendall called the job search ``an innocent
attempt'' by the president to help Lewinsky after their affair
ended because he thought she was ``a good person'' who had been
hurt by their involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big picture here just doesn't exist, and no matter how
much evidence the House managers try to present it just doesn't add
up,'' Kendall told the senators at one point.
</P>

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ After a tangled four-year trial, Raul Salinas de
Gortari, the brother of Mexico's former president, was convicted on
Thursday of ordering the 1994 assassination of a prominent
politician and sentenced to 50 years in prison. It was a stunning
verdict that shattered the impunity that has shielded powerful
Mexicans for decades.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's decision was widely considered to be the most
important criminal verdict in modern Mexico. It is the first time
that a close relative of a figure as powerful as the former
president, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, has faced punishment for a
serious crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``This breaks all the precedents,'' said Sergio Aguayo Quezada,
a historian. ``Raul Salinas is a symbol, the brother of one of the
strongest presidents Mexico has ever had. The judge's decision
gives an enormous boost to the independence of the justice
system.''
</P>
<P>
   But the case, which was marred by missteps, coercion and
manipulation by prosecutors, also exposed the system's disarray.
Raul Salinas was condemned mainly by hearsay evidence, with the
judge admitting there was no ``direct proof.'' The verdict is
likely to remain clouded by doubts over whether his trial was a
fair one. An appeal is already planned.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Salinas was found guilty of being the intellectual author
of the daylight assassination on Sept. 28, 1994, of Jose Francisco
Ruiz Massieu, who was then 48 and a fast-rising star in the
political party that governed Mexico for most of this century.
</P>
<P>
   The case became a mesmerizing drama, which divided families and
exposed the bizarre enmities and intrigues on the inside of a
long-stable political system that was in decline. The murder
charges against Raul Salinas did much to destroy the image of his
brother Carlos, who had been celebrated as a visionary modernizer
when he was president for six years until December 1994. Carlos
Salinas has been living in exile in Ireland and has not been
implicated in the homicide.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have charged that the victim, who was a former
brother-in-law of the Salinas brothers, was also betrayed by his
own brother Mario, 49, who was the first prosecutor to investigate
the shooting. Mario Ruiz Massieu, who was appointed by Carlos
Salinas, stands accused in Mexico of torturing witnesses and
suppressing evidence to conceal the role of Raul Salinas in the
plot to kill his brother. Ruiz Massieu has denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
   As the Salinas family's popularity plummeted, prosecutors
persuaded judges to hold Raul ever since his arrest on Feb. 28,
1995, in a harsh isolation cell in Almoloya Prison, Mexico's most
severe maximum security penitentiary, even though he had not been
convicted of any crime.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas protested his jail conditions to Mary Robinson, the U.N.
high commissioner for human rights, and she agreed to examine the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Under Mexico's justice system, there was no jury trial or
courtroom questioning of witnesses. The trial was conducted by
building a written record of nearly 140,000 pages on which a
federal district judge, Ricardo Ojeda Bohorquez, based his
decision. Ojeda signed the verdict and sentence Thursday afternoon
and sent his clerks to Almoloya Prison to notify Raul Salinas, as
he stood at the bars of a general holding cell, of the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas's wife, Paulina Castanon, emerged from the prison
shortly afterwards, her eyes reddened. She said no family member
had been allowed to accompany Salinas when he was notified of the
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is totally devastating,'' Mrs. Castanon said. ``I will say
it again: Raul is innocent. He has been interred for four years in
a cement tomb.''
</P>
<P>
   Salinas' lawyers said they would file an appeal immediately.
Salinas ``received the verdict with great fortitude,'' said Eduardo
Luengo Creel, the chief defense lawyer. ``He will continue to fight
the battle before the courts to show he is innocent and had nothing
to do with these crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   The accusations against Raul Salinas were based largely on
hearsay evidence from witnesses with obvious biases. Neither of the
two special prosecutors who worked to convict Salinas ever produced
any incontrovertible material evidence linking him to the crime.
</P>
<P>
   In his decision, Ojeda acknowledged there was no ``confession or
direct proof.'' He said his conclusions were derived from
``evidence which wove together in a logical way.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial record was filled with testimony and documentary
evidence that showed that several convicted members of the
assassination team tried to contact Raul Salinas in the hours and
days after the murder. A number of convicted conspirators insisted
in their statements that Raul Salinas had ordered the shooting.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The troubles in the legal case began within hours after Ruiz
Massieu was shot on a busy Mexico City street by a lone gunman, who
was captured at the scene. Under torture by police, the gunman,
Daniel Aguilar Trevino, soon named all of his closest accomplices.
He did not name Raul Salinas.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Salinas hastily appointed Mario Ruiz Massieu to
investigate the killing, even though Mexican law barred him from
investigating a crime against a close relative. Fernando and Jorge
Rodriguez Gonzalez, also brothers, who have been convicted and
jailed for plotting the homicide, testified that detectives working
for Mario Ruiz Massieu beat and brutalized them to force them to
omit reference they had made to Raul Salinas in their first
statements to police.
</P>
<P>
   The current president, Ernesto Zedillo, caused a political
upheaval when, three months after succeeding Carlos Salinas, he
ordered the arrest of Raul Salinas based on the investigations of
new prosecutors he named.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Ruiz Massieu, the first prosecutor, fled to the United
States after learning he would be prosecuted for obstruction of
justice in Mexico. He is under house arrest in New Jersey pending
the outcome of an appeal of his deportation from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But the second special prosecutor, Pablo Chapa Bezanilla, who
was named by Zedillo, also ended up as a fugitive from justice for
a time. Checks showed that Chapa made at least $500,000 in secret
payments to Fernando Rodriguez Gonzalez when he agreed to
strengthen his account that Raul Salinas had been the mastermind of
the plot.
</P>
<P>
   According to other convicted participants, Chapa also joined in
a bizarre caper to plant a body on property belonging to Raul
Salinas, in order to frame him. When local police exposed the
scheme, Chapa fled to Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he returned and was freed on all the charges of
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   The government's winning case was brought to a close by a third
prosecutor, Jose Luis Ramos Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Salinas was also convicted on Thursday on two lesser counts
of perjury and use of false documents. He has been acquitted of
three charges of financial fraud and tax evasion but still faces
one criminal charge of illicit enrichment during his years as a
government employee.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in Switzerland have confiscated more than $90
million from bank accounts linked to Salinas, arguing in civil
proceedings that the money came from drug payoffs. Salinas is also
under investigation in Mexico for narcotics, but no charges have
been brought.

OLYMPIC PANEL TO SHED MORE MEMBERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The embattled International Olympic Committee, under severe
pressure to cleanse and reform itself amid the worst scandal in its
105 years, is expected to ask a dozen or more members to quit this
weekend and will also move to end expense-paid trips to bid cities
before it chooses the site of the 2006 Winter Games this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Besides demanding resignations, sources on the IOC's 11-person
executive board said the panel will recommend that individual
members be banned from visiting future candidate cities, a practice
that it believes fosters bribery and corruption and led to the Salt
Lake City payoff quagmire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can do a very good job of selecting cities without
visiting,'' said Anita DeFrantz, an IOC vice president from the US.
</P>
<P>
   Banning visits, though, would hamper the six cities vying for
the 2006 Games, especially first-time bidders.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would change all our strategies,'' said Evelina
Christillin, president of the Turin committee, who will find out
much about her city's chances when the IOC's site evaluation
commission releases its report on the candidates Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you start a race, you know the rules. If the rules change
after the start. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Turin and the Swiss resort of Sion are considered the
front-runners in a field that includes Zakopane (Poland),
Poprad-Tatry (Slovakia), a joint bid by Helsinki (Finland) and
Lillehammer (Norway), and a three-way campaign mounted by
Klagenfurt (Austria) and nearby towns in Italy and Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
   Since Sion bid for the 2002 Games, the Italians feel they would
be at a disadvantage if visits were banned on short notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IOC members already know about Sion, but none of them came
to Turin,'' says Christillin.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the tradition of visiting, with its free first-class
air travel, five-star hotels, expensive restaurant meals, resort
trips, and exorbitant gifts for IOC members, that led to the payoff
culture that has battered the IOC's august image.
</P>
<P>
   The organization's special inquiry panel has concluded that 16
members took $800,000 in cash and gifts from the Salt Lake bidders
for the 2002 Winter Games, according to a draft of the report
quoted in the Wall Street Journal Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, which also weighed evidence from other cities, found
a pattern of influence peddling that spanned the past two decades
and involved middle men who offered to deliver blocs of votes to
bidding cities for fees up to $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Pirjo Haeggman of Finland, a member of the IOC since 1981 and
one of the first two women elected, stepped down this week and the
IOC was hoping for more resignations before its executive board
demands them when it meets Sunday at Olympic headquarters in
Lausanne, Switzerland. If the members refuse, the IOC's full body
of 115 can expel them when it meets in special session in March.
</P>
<P>
   Though the IOC has not publicly released the names of the other
implicated members, who have been invited to defend themselves
before the board, in previous media reports, eight have been linked
to ``serious offenses'' and face expulsion if they do not resign:
Jean-Claude Ganga (Republic of Congo), David Sibandze (Swaziland),
Agustin Arroyo (Ecuador), Zein El Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir (Sudan),
Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi (Libya), Charles Mukora (Kenya), Sergio
Santander (Chile), and Lamine Keita (Mali). Four others _ former
board members Vitaly Smirnov (Russia) and Kim Un-Yong (South Korea)
_ have been accused of lesser offenses. The inquiry report warned
that members could be subpoenaed by a US grand jury as part of a
Justice Department investigation into the Salt Lake payoffs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the US Olympic Committee, the Salt Lake Organizing
Committee's ethics panel, and the Utah Attorney General are also
conducting investigations.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend's purge at the IOC, which involves only members
linked to the Salt Lake payoffs, may just be the beginning of a
bigger exodus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inappropriate activities of certain members of the IOC did not
commence with the candidacy of Salt Lake City,'' said the report,
which was written by IOC vice president Richard Pound, a Montreal
attorney who said he was once offered a $1 million bribe while
negotiating TV rights fees.
</P>
<P>
   IOC vice president Marc Hodler of Switzerland, who said that the
last four site selections have all been tainted by bribery,
estimates that more than two dozen of his colleagues have peddled
their votes in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it more than 13? Absolutely,'' said Robert Helmick, an Iowa
attorney who resigned from the IOC and the USOC presidency in 1991
amid allegations of conflict of interest, and says he was made a
scapegoat. ``It's been going on for a long time. Some of us sounded
the alarm back in the '80s and early '90s. In 1992, I predicted
that the IOC would blow apart from this.''
</P>
<P>
   If the IOC does not root out its corrupt members and adopt
radical reforms, Olympic insiders say, the tarnish on its hallowed
five rings may well prompt global firms such as Coca-Cola,
McDonald's, and Visa to end their sponsorships, which, along with
TV rights fees, fund the Olympic movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The least they should do is assure the sponsors that the
investigation and cleansing is as thorough as possible,'' says
David D'Alessandro, president of John Hancock, one of the IOC's 11
worldwide sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   The most radical reform would be for the IOC's executive board
to choose the host cities, based on site-evaluation reports and a
group visit. But that seems unlikely to happen, since two-thirds of
the full membership would have to agree to relinquish its most
cherished privilege.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be quite odd for them to erase themselves,'' said one
Olympic insider, who asked not to be named. ``You would be asking
them to admit that they are less honest and less correct than the
executive board. That is difficult to accept.''
</P>
<P>
   More likely, IOC officials say, is that the site-evaluation
committee would narrow the candidate cities from as many as 10 to
two or three and have the full membership choose one.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the executive board recommends inside the palatial
Chateau de Vidy in Lausanne this weekend, the era of perks and
payoffs for the Lords of the Rings appears finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a time to change the culture,'' said a USOC officer.
``This is the time.''

   12 PERCENT GAIN IN IBM PROFIT BEATS WALL STREET FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   IBM reported a 12 percent gain in earnings, exceeding Wall
Street analysts' estimates by 2 cents a share, as strong gains in
software and services offset the economic turmoil in Asia and Latin
America and pricing pressure on key products.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter, IBM reported earnings of $2.35 billion, or
$2.47 a diluted share, compared with $2.09 billion, or $2.11 a
share. Revenue rose 6 percent, to $25.13 billion. Before the
earnings were announced, shares of IBM rose $2.50, to $197.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems, one of the biggest makers of computers that
run the Internet, said its second-quarter earnings rose 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   CURRENCY AND STOCKS FALL IN BRAZIL
</P>
<P>
   A day after the Brazilian Congress approved austerity measures
perceived by investors as a crucial test of the country's
commitment to reduce systematic overspending, its currency and
stock market fell, and fears mounted that Brazil is running low on
dollars to pay for debts, imports and other expenses.
</P>
<P>
   JUDGE QUESTIONS MICROSOFT WITNESS
</P>
<P>
   The judge in Microsoft's antitrust trial asked the company's
expert witness on economics a series of skeptical questions,
suggesting that the software giant may have a difficult time with
one of its defenses _ that it does not have a monopoly in the
market for personal-computer operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   PROFIT FALLS 54 PERCENT AT BANKERS TRUST
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust, posting its next-to-last earnings report before
the expected completion of its acquisition by Deutsche Bank, said
its profit in the fourth quarter plunged 54 percent.
</P>
<P>
   PROMOTION WITHIN INSURANCE FAMILY
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Greenberg, the eldest son of one of the United States'
most influential insurance executives, Maurice ``Hank'' Greenberg,
was named president of Marsh &AMP; McLennan and was designated its next
chief executive and chairman. As the eventual chief of Marsh,
Greenberg will be heading a company that mainly arranges insurance
coverage for corporations with American International Group, run by
his father, and other insurers.
</P>
<P>
   ROUGH TIMES FOR DRUG STOCKS
</P>
<P>
   After soaring 49.9 percent last year, the Standard &AMP; Poor's Drug
Index, a bellwether of industry stocks, has become one of Wall
Street's laggards. Not only has the index trailed the 0.5 percent
gain of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500, but it has notched a negative
5.49 percent return this year.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-NAMING LOTTERY IS POSSIBLE
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit board responsible for opening the Internet's
domain-name registration business to competition is leaning toward
an international lottery to pick the five companies that will get
the first shot at ending the government-sanctioned monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   LUCENT EARNINGS CLIMB 26 PERCENT
</P>
<P>
   Lucent Technologies said that earnings before charges and gains
rose 26 percent in its fiscal first quarter, more than analysts
expected, but that sales growth lagged behind forecasts because the
company could not complete the paperwork on some orders in time.
The shares of the telephone-equipment maker fell $8.875, or 7.7
percent, to $106.625.
</P>
<P>
   SBC Communications reported a 17.8 percent increase in
fourth-quarter profits driven by growth in services such as caller
identification and voice messaging.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, the securities firm, said its
fourth-quarter earnings declined 32 percent as trading revenue
fell.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon, the largest oil company in the United States, said its
fourth-quarter income fell 30 percent as crude-oil prices plunged.
</P>
<P>
   Sears, Roebuck's profits fell in the fourth quarter after the
retailer took one-time charges and suffered from falling clothing
sales.
</P>
<P>
   BOEING EXPECTED TO SETTLE BIAS SUIT
</P>
<P>
   Boeing is expected to announce Friday that it has agreed to pay
$15 million to settle a racial discrimination suit brought by
hundreds of its workers nationwide.

(Eds: Writethru to be filed by 10:30 p.m. ET) 
 WASHINGTON: Cold War. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clinton said that of all the new threats, the one that ``keeps
me awake at night'' is the possibility of germ attack. ``A chemical
attack would be horrible, but it would be finite,'' he said, adding
that it would not spread. But a biological attack could spread, he
added, ``kind of like the gift that keeps on giving.''
</P>
<P>
   During Clinton's presidency, terrorism has emerged as one of the
nation's thorniest security challenges, its dangers more diffuse
than those of the Cold War yet more immediate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he had began worrying about biological terrorism
and other unconventional threats six years ago, in February 1993,
after Islamic radicals exploded a bomb under the World Trade Center
in New York. The bombing killed six people and injured more than a
thousand.
</P>
<P>
   He said his concerns about the danger of germ or chemical attack
were deepened by reports that Iraq had retained some chemical
weapons and by the activities of a Japanese cult, Aum Shinrikyo,
which attacked the Tokyo subway system in 1995 with a nerve agent,
killing 12 and injuring 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he thought it was more likely that a rogue state
would attack American surrogates overseas than wage terrorism in
the United States itself.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Osama bin Laden, a Saudi fugitive who is accused
of masterminding the U.S. embassy bombings in Africa in August, has
``made an effort to get chemical weapons'' and ``may have'' tried
to get germ weapons. ``We don't know that they have them,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said ``a lot of what we've done already,'' some of it
secret, ``has delayed'' foreign efforts to develop and deploy
chemical, biological or nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   He said that ultimately, the best defense against unconventional
warfare and biological terrorism in particular would be scientific
strides in deciphering the genetic material in microbes and humans,
so vaccines could be tailored for quick response to an attack.
</P>
<P>
   This, he said, would allow defense to stay ahead of the offense.
His hope, he said, was that the United States would use ``each new
wave of technology to close the gap between offense and defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, he endorsed the Human Genome Project, a costly
federally funded effort to map human genetic material, saying it
would be an important part of the shield that his administration is
building.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's personal interest in the threat, aides agree, has
become a powerful force behind secret meetings, actions and
directives meant to bolster antiterrorism work and to counter what
aides describe as a growing danger to civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The budget outlined by the White House Thursday, to be formally
presented by the president on Friday at the National Academy of
Sciences, includes $10 billion to defend against terrorism, weapons
of mass destruction and ``cyber attacks,'' according to the White
House statement.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the money _ about $8.5 billion _ is earmarked for the
defense of American embassies and other buildings and personnel
against conventional weapons like car and truck bombs. The rest is
divided among existing and new programs to counter biological,
chemical and computer attacks, especially those that could cripple
key parts of the government or the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two years, the administration has almost doubled
the money spent to protect Americans against attacks with
unconventional weapons. In fiscal 1998, this budget was $770
million; in the new budget, it rises to $1,336 million.

AMA TALKING ABOUT A NEW JOB FOR FIRED EDITOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American Medical Association has apparently entered
negotiations over a possible new employment relationship with the
top-ranking editor it fired last week for publishing an article
that indirectly raised issues of presidential sex and impeachment
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. George Lundberg, former editor of the Journal of the
American Medical Association, will be in Boston Friday for a
conference at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Lundberg also
was due to be interviewed by producers of the ``60 Minutes''
television show, but sources say Lundberg's attorney canceled the
interview at the last minute because there were indications that
negotiations might move forward with the AMA.
</P>
<P>
   Lundberg, reached Thursday night, declined to comment other than
to repeat a statement released last week by his lawyer that all
options are under consideration, including litigation. It is
unclear what sort of new job, if any, Lundberg could be offered at
the AMA.
</P>
<P>
   Lundberg's firing, announced last Friday, raised a firestorm of
protests across the country _ from doctors, medical journalists and
others who believed that publication of the article was not a
fireable offense, regardless of the merit of the study he
published. Top AMA officials, who already were distressed by
negative publicity over the firing, reportedly were even more
distressed by the prospect of a ``60 Minutes'' segment on the
termination.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. E. Ratcliffe Anderson, the AMA executive vice president who
fired Lundberg, was not reachable for comment Thursday night,
neither was AMA president Nancy Dickey.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said last week that Lundberg's firing was over a number
of issues, but the only one he spelled out was Lundberg's
``inappropriately and inexcusably interjecting JAMA into a major
political debate'' by publishing in this week's JAMA an article in
which a substantial majority of college students agreed with
President Clinton's controversial contention that oral-genital
contact does not constitute ``having sex.''
</P>
<P>
   The article was based on a 1991 survey of 599 students at an
unnamed state university in the Midwest.

SPORTS COLUMN: SAMARANCH MUST TAKE THE BLAME
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the International Olympic Committee were a major business
corporation, the directors and the stockholders would not be amused
right now. The IOC is essentially in disgrace, visible to the world
as lacking normal discipline or, one could even say, ethics.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC, which preaches sportsmanship to the world, has been
exposed as allowing, by benign neglect at best, perhaps more than
10 percent of its 114 delegates to hustle booty by playing bidding
cities against each other.
</P>
<P>
   Any organization can deal with the lone wolf who cheats. What
has happened at the IOC is much worse: a network of greedy
delegates, opportunistic agents and cities on the make.
</P>
<P>
   This is a mess. The corporations that pay the bills of the
Olympic movement are understandably nervous. They do not want to
commit further money to the next set of games until they can be
reassured that their corporate logos are not going to be caught up
in some decadelong Olympicgate.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a Kenneth Starr-type prosecutor quivering with delight
at the hint that Salt Lake City credit cards had been used at
``escort services'' to entertain visiting delegates.
</P>
<P>
   International corporations know what to do after an
embarrassment or a bad quarter or two. The directors summon the
chief executive officer into the corporate suite and give him the
world's biggest buyout. The process is cold-blooded, but it
protects the company from a leader who may have lost touch.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC does not have that kind of oversight because it is in
the control of Juan Antonio Samaranch, 78, the caudillo since 1980,
with his taste for power and his language skills and his
credibility in the old communist nations because of his former
position of Spanish ambassador to Moscow. His haughty responses in
a telling interview in The Wall Street Journal this week indicate
that Samaranch is not about to implement reform in the final two
years of his term.
</P>
<P>
   To give Samaranch his due, the IOC has expanded from merely a
haven of the titled and the privileged to include new leadership
like the American rower and lawyer, Anita DeFrantz, now an IOC vice
president. Samaranch has sometimes been an eloquent voice for
peace. And the issue is not whether Samaranch may have accepted the
odd shotgun in Salt Lake City or the samurai sword in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the president of an international organization, he receives
protocol gifts,'' said IOC vice president Richard Pound on
Thursday. ``But whatever he gets goes back to the IOC, either on
display or in storage.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound will fly to Lausanne, Switzerland, to present his report
on possible corruption in the IOC on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to express our sincere apologies for the actions of
certain members,'' Pound said Thursday. ``Their conduct has been
completely contrary to everything the Olympic movement has worked
so hard to represent.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound insisted that Salt Lake City had been the obvious choice
for the 2002 Winter Games, with or without the graft. There were
more than a few locals in Salt Lake City who were quite comfortable
giving tuition, medical care, presents, money and
goodness-knows-what to every delegate with an extended hand.
</P>
<P>
   Bidding by cities does not have to be a festival of sleaze.
There can be rules, says Donna de Varona, the Olympic swimming gold
medalist and journalist and head of the organizing committee for
the 1999 Women's World Cup of soccer. De Varona previously helped
screen potential cities for the 1994 men's World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a limit on how much every city could spend,'' de
Varona said Thursday. ``No gifts were acceptable. No videos were
allowed, just slides. Each city made a bare-bones proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   The pity of the current IOC scandal is that more than a few
rogue delegates were totally comfortable in shaking down local
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Pound said: ``We had extreme debriefing after the bidding
process with every city. We just didn't get anything.''
</P>
<P>
   There was clearly a don't-ask, don't-tell policy in effect,
straight from Lausanne. It would be hard to have faith in this
administration, particularly with the monster of drug abuse looming
over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Pound, a Canadian, a former Olympic swimmer, with a good
reputation and vigorous involvement in Olympic business, can be
counted on to document some of the blatant abuses.
</P>
<P>
   However, that would only be the first rudimentary step toward a
more modern and democratic IOC that better served athletes without
ignoring graft. This meeting in Lausanne is the ideal time for Juan
Antonio Samaranch to serve the Olympic movement and resign.

WARILY, CAMBODIAN BACKS U.N. PLANS FOR KHMER ROUGE TRIALS
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ Prime Minister Hun Sen confirmed to the
United Nations on Thursday that he supports its efforts to set up a
tribunal to try Khmer Rouge leaders. But he raised questions about
the scope that could complicate these efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Hun Sen also
insisted that any trial must not threaten Cambodia's newly achieved
peace and its efforts at national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two topics, to seek a formula for the trial and national
reconciliation, must be taken into consideration simultaneously,
without intending to prioritize one over another,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A team of three legal experts is to present to Annan next month
their recommendations for a possible trial, and some of Hun Sen's
questions about its form _ ``International or national? A mix of
both? Or other form of tribunal?'' _ are questions the experts must
address.
</P>
<P>
   Potentially more troubling questions, raised by the Khmer Rouge
themselves, have to do with whether any proceeding would consider
crimes committed by other leaders or nations in the years before
and after the Khmer Rouge reign. More than a million people died
during the Khmer Rouge years, from 1975 to 1979. Many others died
in warfare before and after that.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the events from 1970 to 1998 ``an inseparable set of
facts,'' Hun Sen insisted, ``Whatever the court will be, it has to
look into related causes and effects from the beginning to the
end.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan's representative here, Thomas Hammarberg, who met with Hun
Sen on Thursday morning, said the prime minister did not appear to
be making a condition of these concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Hammarberg said that it had been established for some time that
any trial would consider only ``the crimes of Khmer Rouge leaders
from 1975 to 1979.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he asked Hun Sen whether his references to a broader
time frame amounted to a condition for holding a trial ``and the
answer is, no, there is no such condition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If one wants to raise other issues and address other crimes,
that will have to be through other tribunals or trials,'' said
Hammarberg, a Swedish diplomat. ``I got the impression this is not
something where there is a misunderstanding between the United
Nations and the prime minister.''
</P>
<P>
   Hammarberg also said he told Hun Sen ``there is no conflict in
principle between justice and peace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, experience from other countries is that if you sweep
problems of this magnitude, such injustices, under the carpet, you
run the risk of risking the peace in the future,'' he said. ``It is
a difficult task, and I think the government should be respected on
that aspect. It will not be easy. But they have stated to me very
clearly that they are behind this process.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge faced by the United Nations, he said, is to find a
formula that will answer the needs of both Cambodia, which is still
suffering from the brutalities of the Khmer Rouge years, and of the
international community, which demands justice for crimes against
humanity.
</P>
<P>
   He said any proceedings must be ``absolutely watertight when it
comes to judicial standards, with no opening whatsoever for
political or other pressure _ a proceeding which cannot be
questioned afterwards as lacking in professionalism and
impartiality.''

KOSOVO MASSACRE WAS ACT OF REVENGE BY SERBIAN FORCES, MONITORS
REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: In 10th graf adds a sentence of background about the 700
monitors.) 
 (fe) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ International monitors who discovered the bodies of
45 ethnic Albanians shot execution-style have concluded in their
official report that the attack in the Kosovo village was an act of
revenge by Serbian forces for the killing of four of their men.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which has not been made public, described a scene of
bodies with wounds from gunshots at close range and in some cases
at ``extremely close range'' in the front, back or top of the head,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The monitors, who were on the scene immediately before and after
the massacre, concluded that ``the facts as verified by the Kosovo
Verification Mission include evidence of arbitrary detentions,
extrajudicial killings and the mutilation of unarmed civilians of
Albanian ethnic origin by the Yugoslav Army and police.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, written chronologically from Jan. 8 to Jan. 16, the
day after the killings, listed each body found at the site, saying,
for example: ``One adult male killed outside his house. The top of
his head had been removed and was found approximately 15 feet away
from his place of death. The wound appeared to have been caused by
an ax but may have been from a bullet.''
</P>
<P>
   The report said one 12-year-old-boy was shot in the neck and one
male teen-ager was shot in the abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the massacre last Saturday and the immediate
assertion at the scene by a senior U.S. diplomat that Serbian
forces were responsible for the killings led to the current crisis
within the Clinton administration and NATO over what to do about
the separatist province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has blamed the Yugoslav leader, Slobodan
Milosevic, for allowing his troops to use disproportionate force
against people the administration identified as civilians.
State-controlled media in Serbia have asserted that the massacre
was a fake, staged by the ethnic Albanian guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The circumstances of the massacre were further inflamed when
Milosevic accused William Walker, the American diplomat who heads
the teams of international monitors for the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe. The Serbs accused him of being
a stooge of the ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   It now appears Walker will be allowed to remain on the job, but
the Clinton administration said that was ``not sufficient'' and
that the Milosevic must reduce his forces in Kosovo or face
possible airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   The account of the killings, titled: ``Special Report: Massacre
of Civilians in Racak,'' was written by monitors of the OSCE's
Kosovo Verification Mission and has been given to diplomats from
the 54 member countries. More than 700 unarmed monitors were placed
in Kosovo after a cease-fire agreement last October.
</P>
<P>
   Details in the account were graphically elaborated on in an oral
presentation given to the organization in Vienna by a German
diplomat, Berend Borchardt, who was at the scene of the slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Borchardt, the deputy head of the human rights mission of the
OSCE in Kosovo, told the diplomats in Vienna that the victims were
``humble peasants,'' many of whom were dressed in rubber boots.
Borchardt pointed out that the male victims were not dressed in
heavy boots used in military action.
</P>
<P>
   In their report, the monitors said that after the
``well-prepared ambush'' by the ethnic Albanian guerrillas that
left four Serbian police officers dead, Serbian forces started
moving armored vehicles into the area of Stimlje, near Racak.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the massacre, Jan. 15, the monitors were prevented
by Serbian forces from entering Racak but could see houses burning
there.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the day, the report said, a patrol car of monitors drove
into the village. The monitors saw one dead Albanian civilian and
five injured people and heard reports that 20 males had been taken
away by Serbian forces. The monitors had to leave because darkness
was falling, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning several teams of monitors returned to the
village and heard accounts from survivors who said that after
artillery attacks by the Yugoslav army and Serbian police, Serbian
security forces entered the village. Some were dressed in police
uniforms, and others were in black uniforms and ski masks.
</P>
<P>
   The witnesses said they recognized some of the policemen as
being from Stimlje. The survivors also said that the some of the
``assailants'' were Serbian civilians dressed in police uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies were found at three sites in the village, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-three men ``of various ages,'' last seen alive when the
police were arresting them, were found on a ridge behind the
village. Four other men were found in a ravine near the village and
were apparently shot while trying to run away. Twelve men and the
12-year-old boy were found in various places within the village,
including in some homes.
</P>
<P>
   Some families retrieved the bodies of their relatives and
brought them inside, the report said. Five more adults had been
taken by family members to nearby Malopoljce.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Walker arrived at the scene at 1 p.m. on Saturday,
the Serb forces had left and there was a ``heavy presence of
uniformed KLA in the village,'' the report said, referring to the
Kosovo Liberation Army. The guerrillas, who were agitated and in a
vengeful mood, were advised by Walker to exercise restraint, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   After the report was written, diplomats said that 40 of the 45
bodies were removed by the Serbian police from a village mosque,
where they were being prepared by families for burial, to the
government morgue in Pristina where Serbian doctors are conducting
autopsies.

FOOTBALL COLUMN: SAVVY SHOPPERS UNCOVER 2 GEMS IN FREE-AGENT
MARKET
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Smart free-agent shopping _ what you buy and how you use it _
can lift a good team to championship level. The Atlanta Falcons and
the Denver Broncos, the Super Bowl XXXIII participants, prove this.
Both teams are filled with free-agent finds who have provided a
hearty boost.
</P>
<P>
   Among the free agents plucked by the Falcons are linebacker
Cornelius Bennett and safety Eugene Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, in his 12th pro season, came from Buffalo in 1996. He
has played in six conference championship games. This will be his
fifth Super Bowl appearance. He gives the Falcons extra quickness
on defense and the ability to expertly match up with running backs
in pass coverage. Robinson, a 14-season pro, arrived from Green Bay
before this season. He leads all active players in career
interceptions with 54. His savvy and intelligence at playing safety
are respected league wide.
</P>
<P>
   Among the free agents plucked by the Broncos are cornerback
Darrien Gordon and defensive end Neil Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, a sixth-year player who doubles as a punt returner,
arrived in Denver in 1997 from San Diego. He gained two
interceptions against the New York Jets in the American Football
Conference championship game. He owns the National Football
League's career-best punt-return average. Smith spent nine seasons
in Kansas City before joining Denver in 1997. He is an adept pass
rusher and run defender with range (6 feet 4 inches) and size (270
pounds).
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta and Denver have proved to be smart free-agent shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Their best picks? Ray Buchanan and Bill Romanowski.
</P>
<P>
   Guys nicknamed Big-Play Ray, and Romo.
</P>
<P>
   A Dirty Bird and a guy worth a Mile High salute.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, a cornerback, is in his second Atlanta season after
playing four seasons with Indianapolis. Last season he led the
Falcons in interceptions (5). This season he led the Falcons in
interceptions (7). He is 5-9, 195 pounds, a cat-quick cornerback
with instincts for the football and for the best moves of
receivers. He understands that playing cornerback in the NFL means
attitude. That without it, a cornerback always matched against the
fastest and among the most dangerous players on the field, cannot
flourish. He might be beaten on one play. Seldom, though, is he
defeated for an entire game.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, 27, aligns against the opposing team's best receiver
and travels with him all day long. He offers a tremendous air of
spirit and confidence in the Falcons' locker room and on the field.
Those intangibles of being a supreme cover guy and a positive team
influence have helped him become a glue for the Falcons. He has
provided an extra edge. A Super Bowl edge.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan is part of a defense that led the NFL this season in
takeaways with 44. Atlanta allowed only 289 points (18.1 per game),
but Denver was close (309 points allowed, an average of 19.3
allowed per game). Both defenses in Super Bowl XXXIII face potent
offenses: Denver scored 501 points this season; Atlanta scored 442.
</P>
<P>
   And both teams are used to winning _ in the last 25 games for
each team, Atlanta owns a 21-4 record and Denver is 20-5.
</P>
<P>
   Romanowski and winning are synonymous. This rugged linebacker is
in his 11th pro season and in his third with Denver. He played six
seasons in San Francisco and two in Philadelphia. His teams have
won 128 regular-season games and lost 48 (a .730 winning
percentage) and recorded a 16-5 post-season record. He has played
in seven conference championship games. He has won three Super
Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Romanowski, 32, plays his position with tremendous fire and
desire. He is a hitter. He made 11 tackles, forced a fumble and
recovered a fumble against the Jets in the AFC championship game.
He gives the Broncos' defense teeth. Grit. Intensity. He is a trash
talker on the field who backs it up. He comes early to work each
day and leaves late.
</P>
<P>
   One of his greatest contributions is durability. Romanowski has
started 64 consecutive NFL games.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever the ball is in Super Bowl XXXIII, Buchanan and
Romanowski will be somewhere nearby. Atlanta and Denver can thank
these two players, two free agents that were there for any smart
shopper, right there on the market, but it was these teams that
plucked them. And both came into their respective fold and and
helped mold their clubs into Super Bowl caliber.

<P>
   ROME _ When Pope John Paul II held a recent working lunch to
prepare for his visit to Mexico, which begins on Friday, one
Vatican official present said that the 78-year-old pope spoke with
deep nostalgia about his first papal trip there 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This is not surprising. This is John Paul's fourth visit to
Mexico, but that first voyage in January 1979 was a rare moment in
history: a youthful-looking, untested pope was greeted by millions
of Roman Catholics with an outpouring of hope and excitement even
the Vatican had not expected.
</P>
<P>
   And that trip, in which he spoke out sternly against the leftist
liberation theology then polarizing the Roman Catholic Church in
Latin America, unveiled the Polish-born pope's unwavering stance
against communism of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   As he returns to prepare the Americas for the third millennium,
the pope finds himself once again battling an ideology that he
feels oppresses much of humanity, only this time it is capitalism &UR; .
 &LR;  ``The human race is facing forms of slavery which are new and
more subtle than those of the past,'' the pope warned in an
apostolic letter last month, while talking about an unbridled
free-market system. ``And for far too many people, freedom remains
a word without meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the world has changed since that ground-breaking first
trip. Communism has all but collapsed across the globe.
Revolutionary liberation theology is almost, if not quite, extinct.
The Mexican constitution was then so fiercely anti-clerical that
priests were banned from wearing collars in public. The Mexican
government changed its laws to allow religious freedom in 1991 and
opened diplomatic relations with the Vatican the following year.
</P>
<P>
   The pope himself is also strikingly different: Then vigorous and
bursting with health, John Paul II is now frail, stooped and shaky
with the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   One thing has not changed: In what has proved the bane of the
twilight years of his papacy, the problems of Third World poverty
that he so boldly emphasized in Mexico two decades ago, have not
improved.
</P>
<P>
   His trips to Mexico City and St. Louis have a dual purpose: He
wants to re-energize Catholics and their bishops to pursue what he
calls the new evangelization, his desire to deepen the church's
relationship with its followers and also broaden it by seeking new
converts.
</P>
<P>
   But he also wants to rattle the conscience of the free market.
``International institutions, national governments and the centers
controlling the world economy must all undertake brave plans and
projects to ensure a more just sharing of the goods of the world,''
the pope said in an address on Tuesday. It is a theme he is certain
to repeat throughout his visit.
</P>
<P>
   Having watched the collapse of communism, the pope now wants a
new political system for the 21st century, where the free market is
reined in by humanitarian concerns. His frequent calls for Third
World debt relief and income redistribution are all part of a
larger vision of a better world order.

 ROME: world order.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The pope has said the church cannot present a new economic model
for the world, but he offers the church's social teaching ``as an
indispensable and ideal orientation'' for governments to follow.
Some view his message as a kind of Christian liberation theology.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all the promises, suddenly nobody seems to care about
the poor anymore,'' said Rev. Lorenzo Albacete, a theology
professor at St. Joseph's seminary in Yonkers, who accompanied the
pope to Cuba last year. ``Neo-liberalism has made the poor
invisible, and the church down there is the only one, badly or not,
that is holding up their cause. In Latin America, it's not
liberation theology, but it may be post-liberation theology.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the pope is not visiting Mexico and the United
States. He goes to Mexico to to deliver an ``apostolic
exhortation,'' a reply to the bishops of North and South America,
who together held a synod in Rome in 1997, one of the largest
meetings of bishops since the ecumenical council Vatican II. To
address their concerns _ on matters including economic justice,
Third World debt, the shortage of priests and the growth of
evangelical Protestant movements, as well as abortion and the death
penalty _ the pope plans to spend four days in Mexico City, then
travel to St. Louis for a 36-hour visit.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican pointedly refers to the pope's trip as a visit to
America, lumping the two continents together. The wording is a
reflection of the Vatican's long and Eurocentric view of history
from the arrival of Christianity in the New World 500 years ago.
Addressing the synod, the pope asked the bishops to ``consider the
continent as a whole, from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego, without
introducing a separation between the north, the center or the
south, so as not to risk a contrast between them.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also a sign that the pope wants to ingrain in North
American Catholics a stronger sense of solidarity with their
brothers and sisters in the South. ``He wants to get North American
church out of its English-language bunker and start thinking of
itself as one Catholic Church in the Western hemisphere,'' George
Weigel, a Catholic theologian whose biography of John Paul II is
due to be published in October. ``And he wants Latin American
Catholics to think of themselves not as victims but as agents of
their own history.''
</P>
<P>
   And of their future. The pope has been planning how to usher in
the third millennium ever since he was elected. Disappointed by
what he sees as the secularism and alienation that runs through
Europe, he looks to the more than 780 million Catholics of North
and South America as the main source of expansion in the third
millennium. The pope's call for a new Catholic evangelization,
however, has been muted by widespread indifference in rich
countries and the spread of evangelical Protestant churches in poor
ones.
</P>
<P>
   When the pope addressed Mexican bishops during a visit in 1990,
he told them that they were partly to blame that the church was
losing ground to fundamentalist groups, saying they had left many
Mexicans ``deplorably vulnerable'' to proselytizing by Protestant
denominations.
</P>
<P>
   This was a leitmotif of the synod, where many Latin American
bishops complained about the ``invasion'' of Protestant sects,
whose financing mostly comes from North America. And that challenge
from Christian rivals is as vexing to the Vatican as the spread of
liberation theology was 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was at a bishops' conference in Puebla during his 1979 trip
that the pope warned against liberation theology. By the end of the
1980s, Marxist-leaning priests and bishops in Latin America had
been removed, and the movement lost much of its support among the
clergy. The inequities still rampant under the free market system
have raised the consciousness of many in the church hierarchy,
however. They may abhor the doctrine of liberation theology, but
church leaders in Mexico and throughout Latin American have adopted
some of the language.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Marxism fell, we thought everything would be resolved,
but instead, no,'' said Archbishop Javier Lozano Barragan of
Mexico, a Vatican official who attended the Puebla meeting. ``Now
we have a neo-liberalism on which the poor get poorer and the
hungry are marginalized. There has to be something besides the free
market.''
</P>
<P>
   But the pope is returning at a time when the role of the church
as a champion of the poor and oppressed in Mexico is being
challenged in Chiapas, a southern state in Mexico, where leftist
guerrillas are battling government forces. Catholic priests serving
Indian populations have come under attack by the government. Some,
like Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia, who until last year served as a
mediator in peace talks between the government and the rebels, are
accused by government officials of being supporters of the rebels.
A group of conservative activists and landowners in Chiapas sent a
public letter to the pope on Tuesday asking him to remove Ruiz.
</P>
<P>
   Some Vatican officials believe that Ruiz has gone too far.
Mexicans will be anxiously awaiting to hear whether the pope will
address the problem of Chiapas while visiting the country.
</P>
<P>
   While the pope is in St. Louis, many Americans will be riveted
by the pope's meeting with President Clinton. The Vatican, which
has studiously avoided any comment on the impeachment trial
clouding Clinton's presidency, views the visit as a courtesy call
from one head of state to another. ``They never asked, never
commented,'' said Lindy Boggs, the U.S. ambassador to the Holy See.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. news media are likely to give greater weight to the
iconography of a handshake between one of the world's most
respected moral leaders and a president who is on trial on charges
that he lied under oath about an extramarital affair.

DALY'S BOOMING DRIVES STEAL A PART OF JORDAN'S SPOTLIGHT 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Texas, Britain)   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA QUINTA, Calif. _ Put John Daly, Michael Jordan, and Charles
Barkley together on a golf course and stuff happens.
</P>
<P>
   In another lively day at the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, Daly
proved he still has a flair for the dramatic. Playing in a foursome
with Jordan, Barkley and Roy Green, a former National Football
League player, Daly drew roars from the gallery with his booming
drives, enjoyed the company of his celebrity partners, and moved
himself into contention.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting a 6-under par 66, equaling the best round of the day,
Daly soared into a three-way tie for second place with Tom Pernice
Jr. and Bo Van Pelt at 9 under par (135), two strokes behind Fred
Funk (133), who shot a 4-under par 68 at Indian Wells Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Pernice, who started the day in a three-way tie for first with
Ben Bates and John Huston, shot an even par 72 at Bermuda Dunes.
Huston shot a 73 at the Arnold Palmer Private Course at PGA West,
and fell into a fifth-place tie at eight under par. Bates shot a 74
at Palmer, falling into a tie for eighth place at seven under par.
Meanwhile, Van Pelt shot a 70 at Indian Wells to stay in
contention.
</P>
<P>
   It was no surprise that spectators gravitated to Tamarisk
Country Club, one of the tournament's four courses. People wanted
to see Daly smash drives into orbit. They just wanted to see
Jordan. They wanted to hear Barkley. They were not disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   For Daly, it was a blast. ``We laughed the whole round,'' Daly
said. ``It was a treat for me to play golf a little more loose than
I usually do. I wish I could do it every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike was playing exceptionally well. Roy hit OK. We're still
trying to straighten out Charles with that break dance move on his
backswing. But other than that, it was a great time.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley's off-season is apparently almost over because after the
round, Daly confirmed that Barkley had agreed to contract terms
with the Houston Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was his agent,'' joked Daly. ``I only take 4 percent.'
</P>
<P>
   But Daly's true talent is on the golf course, and he showed that
Thursday, along with his ability to focus despite distractions. He
overcame wind gusts of up to 45 miles an hour that delayed the
start by an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Daly's power is always an advantage, but he was also accurate.
Through 36 holes, Daly was the only player in the field who had not
made a bogey. This from a player who has suffered through some
triple-bogeys, or worse, during his time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I only missed one green, and for me to do that when
the wind is blowing this hard gives me confidence to say I can play
some tight golf courses,'' Daly said. ``I was really disappointed
not winning a golf tournament on the West Coast last year. I got
off my practice habits. That is the goal, to stay hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   Staying sober is always a goal for Daly, a recovering alcoholic.
He admitted recently that he has taken anti-depressant medication
for years, but he recently stopped taking it, and he said he can
feel the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to try without it,'' said Daly, who won the 1991 PGA
Championship, and the 1995 British Open. ``If I get in a bind, then
I will go see another doctor. I just feel that my body is telling
me what it wants to do. Certain times in my life, I think I needed
it. But right now, I think anti-depressants have made me very lazy,
taken a lot of energy out of me. It could be a bad move on my part,
but it could also make a world of difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly's 66 Thursday was his best round on the PGA Tour since last
March. He has not won since the 1995 British Open, and his best
finish last year was fourth place. He finished 77th on the money
list, the fourth consecutive year out of the top 50.
</P>
<P>
   CHIP SHOTS:
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan's amateur team was 11 under par on Thursday,
moving to 25 under for the tournament, six strokes behind the
leading team. ... Paul Azinger's 66 lifted him from 104th place
into a tie for 18th.

FAA DELAYS PLANS TO REPLACE RADAR SCREENS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Wash.)   By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Aviation Administration has all but
given up its goal of replacing the radar screens in the first of
hundreds of low-altitude air traffic control offices by March,
because recent tests showed that the system bogs down during basic
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is with software, the agency's perennial weak spot,
and officials say they cannot yet predict when it will be fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Although the agency does not need the new screens immediately,
it says it must develop replacement screens before the old ones
wear out, especially in New York, where a unique controller
workstation is used.
</P>
<P>
   The first screens were supposed to be put into service in March
at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, but Peter H. Challan,
director of air traffic control systems development, said, ``I am
not confident that that will happen at all.'' He said that he hoped
to know by the end of next month how long the delay would be.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA's program to replace the screens is a result of the
collapse of a vast, multibillion-dollar modernization program
called the Advanced Automation System, which was frequently
postponed for periods of a few months, until finally the FAA gave
up.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has successfully begun replacement of another group
of screens, in the Air Route Traffic Control Centers, which
generally handle longer-distance, higher-altitude flights. Rodney
Slater, the Transportation Secretary, and Jane Garvey, the FAA
administrator, dedicated the first group of screens in a ceremony
in Auburn, Wash., near Seattle, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is with new workstations for terminal radar
controls, known as tracons. There are about 250 across the country.
The FAA's plan is initially to install new screens but maintain the
old computers in the back room, in Washington, New York and other
early sites. Later, it will replace screens and back-room computers
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the program, Standard Terminal Automation Replacement
System, ran into trouble when controllers and technicians
complained that it lacked some features of the existing system.
Many of those problems have been resolved, but response times have
slowed.
</P>
<P>
   Michael M. Hoeffler, a vice president of Raytheon Systems Co.,
which is building the system, said the reason might be changes made
to accommodate the controllers, but controllers denied this.
Raytheon Systems is a subsidiary of Raytheon Co.
</P>
<P>
   The problems are in everyday functions. For example, the system
must allow controllers to ``hand off'' aircraft as they move from
one sector to another. Normally a new aircraft arrives on the
controller's screen as a blinking icon. ``When you click the
button, it would stop flashing immediately and you've advised
previous controller, it belongs to you,'' said Michael P. McNally,
a vice president of the controllers' union, the National Air
Traffic Controllers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, ``it's seconds, and in our world, that's something
we're concerned about.'' Even at low altitudes, jets are often
moving at 400 feet per second, and separation distances are smaller
in Tracon territory than in the high-altitude Centers.
</P>
<P>
   Typing in new data on a plane, or zooming in or zooming out to
see a different area on the scope, the system bogs down, McNally
said. But Hoeffler said the delays were generally less than 2
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation Department's inspector general, Kenneth M.
Mead, said that there was nothing wrong with finding problems
during testing, but that the schedule was ``very compressed'' and
did not allow time for corrections. Finding problems this late was
``troublesome,'' he said, predicting a delay of months.
</P>
<P>
   He said, though, that the problems encountered so far were not
as numerous or complex as the ones that doomed the earlier system.
</P>
<P>
   Delay causes several problems. The FAA made solemn assurances to
Congress that the system would be available for use at National in
March. When the contract for the program, known as Stars, was
signed in 1996, the FAA described the procurement as a test of the
flexible acquisition powers it was given by Congress after the
collapse of the earlier program.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem, according to Mead and others, is that the FAA
has resolved to bring into the design process the technicians who
will maintain the system and the controllers who will use it, but
has not struck a balance between participation and delay.
</P>
<P>
   Challan said that the FAA had tried to describe precisely to
Raytheon what it wanted, to make sure that it was something
controllers could use, but when the prototypes were ready it had
found that changes were needed because there were ``aspects of
operational suitability that are not definable by the English
language.''

UNITED AIRLINES FACES LONG ODDS AS IT PURSUES MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mergers have a poor record of success in general, but they have
been particularly unsuccessful in the highly regulated and highly
unionized airline industry. Yet that has not stopped executives
from trying, no matter how difficult the obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   To many in the industry, the chances that United Airlines would
acquire America West Airlines, the United States' ninth-largest
carrier, seemed slim on Thursday, one day after United declared its
interest, even as it appeared that Delta Air Lines Inc. might also
be interested in doing a deal with America West, and Southwest
Airlines refused to rule out the possibility of making a bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The probability of United, the largest carrier in the West,
merging with America West, the third-largest carrier in the West,
is closer to zero than any other number,'' said Gordon Bethune, the
chairman and chief executive of Continental Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   His words carry a lot of weight because Continental not only has
a marketing alliance with America West and owns 8 percent of its
voting stock, but it also has the right of first refusal to buy the
controlling stake in America West held by Texas Pacific Group, the
investment partnership run by financier David Bonderman, who also
sits on Continental's board.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the arguments of the many skeptics, Bethune said that he
did not believe that the Justice Department, which filed suit in
October to prevent Northwest Airlines from buying a controlling
stake in Continental, would allow United to buy America West, which
is owned by America West Holdings Corp.
</P>
<P>
   United, a unit of UAL Corp., would also have to get permission
to do the deal from its pilots, who own 25 percent of United and
might be reluctant to compromise their seniority by joining with
America West's pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Even if those two substantial hurdles were overcome, Bethune
said, Continental managers would ``assert our rights and do what is
best for our shareholders.'' He declined to say whether that meant
Continental would acquire America West itself.
</P>
<P>
   Buying control would not necessarily be expensive. Texas
Pacific, which helped bring America West out of bankruptcy in 1994,
owns about 1 million shares, or 2 percent, of America West stock.
But the shares have 50 times the voting power, giving the
partnership 47 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of America West soared 18 percent Thursday on the New
York Stock Exchange in the first trading since United's
announcement late Wednesday. It closed at $23.0625, up $3.5625. But
even adding a 100 percent premium, the value of the Texas Pacific
stake equals only $50 million, a sum well within the means of
either United or Continental.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there are those who believe that a United deal is
not so far-fetched. ``I don't think there is an automatic block by
the Justice Department or by labor,'' said Brian Harris, an airline
analyst at Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   He said Phoenix-based America West, which had $2 billion in
revenues last year, is one-tenth the size of United, while
Northwest and Continental are the fourth- and fifth-largest
domestic carriers. In addition, America West has a much younger
work force than United, which makes merging the two labor groups
easier.
</P>
<P>
   Madison Walton, a spokesman for United's pilots union, which was
briefed on the possible acquisition by the airline's top managers
on Tuesday, declined to comment. ``It's premature,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both America West and United also declined to comment. But two
people who had knowledge of the talks between the two airlines and
who insisted on anonymity said that they were in the early stages.
``It's very early for the party, if there is going to be a party at
all,'' one said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said United was interested in America West so that it
could solidify its position on the West Coast.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There has not been a major airline merger in more than a decade.
Airlines found that merging disparate fleets and competing employee
groups ended up causing more headaches than benefits. Regulators
have also taken a dim view of big airline mergers as the industry
has consolidated over the past 20 years. But small ones, such as
American Airline's recent purchase of Reno Air for $124 million,
have raised no objections in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the industry has favored looser alliances in
which carriers sell tickets on one another's flights as if they
were their own. But even these agreements have proved difficult to
implement.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest and Continental recently began their alliance after
spending a year trying to appease regulators. They have not
entirely succeeded but have gone ahead, risking possible government
intervention. Last fall, Delta's pilots blocked a proposed alliance
with United because the airline refused to give them a seat on the
board.
</P>
<P>
   But the airline industry is notoriously faddish: When one
airline makes a move, the others feel compelled to follow for fear
of being left behind. On Thursday, in the wake of the news that
United was talking with America West, a report by Reuters quoted an
unidentified source saying that Delta had also been talking with
America West.
</P>
<P>
   Delta declined to comment on the report. America West reiterated
what it said Wednesday, that it had been contacted by several
airlines. But speaking to Bloomberg News last week, William Franke,
America West's chairman, said that Delta and United were the two
major airlines that would likely be interested in America West.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Airlines, the country's biggest discount airline, has
shunned acquisitions. But asked on Thursday about America West,
which directly competes with Southwest on many routes, Gary Kelly,
Southwest's chief executive officer, did not rule out making a bid.
``Certainly we are not going to foreclose that at this stage,'' he
said. ``Especially given that the industry seems to be in an
aggressive mode of consolidation.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately on Thursday, UAL and Continental posted lower
fourth-quarter earnings, reflecting a general softening in airline
revenues compared with last year.
</P>
<P>
   At United, profit before charges fell 18 percent to $189
million, or $1.52 a fully distributed share, from $231 million, or
$1.74, in the corresponding period last year. Revenue rose 1
percent to $4.28 billion, from $4.24 billion in 1997's final
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Continental's net income declined to $66 million, or 91 cents a
share, from $73 million, or 97 cents, in the same quarter last
year. Revenue rose 5.8 percent to $1.95 billion, from $1.84 billion
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Both carriers exceeded the average estimate of analysts surveyed
by First Call Corp., but Wall Street had revised down its earnings
projections in recent months.

A RULING FAVORS BOTTLER OF COKE

<P>
   A federal judge Thursday denied a Maryland soft-drink
distributor's request for sanctions against Coca-Cola Enterprises
Inc., the Coca-Cola Co.'s largest bottler, in connection with
documents the bottler filed in a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ruled that a jury would have to determine whether the

BOEING CALLED SET TO SETTLE BIAS SUIT FOR $15 MILLION
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boeing Co. is expected to announce Friday that it has agreed to
pay $15 million to settle a racial discrimination suit brought by
hundreds of its workers, most of them African-American.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, which was filed last year, charged that Boeing
consistently passed over the employees for promotions, denied them
equal pay and retaliated against those who complained.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing denies that there is a pattern of discrimination at the
company. Last fall it won a case brought by a former security
manager who made many of the same claims.
</P>
<P>
   But Boeing's chairman and chief executive Philip Condit has
acknowledged that there is room for improvement at the company,
which employs 230,000 people. In August, he agreed to meet with the
Rev. Jesse Jackson at Boeing's headquarters in Seattle to discuss
the discrimination charges and other ways Boeing could improve its
relations with African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The two men struck up a rapport, and Jackson visited Boeing
factories in St. Louis and Wichita, Kan. Boeing helped sponsor a
conference in New York earlier this month organized by Jackson,
designed to push minority-owned businesses more into the
mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is expected to attend a news conference this morning
that will announce the settlement, according to two people
involved.
</P>
<P>
   Reached Thursday, Jackson said that a settlement was
``imminent'' and that he planned to meet with Boeing executives
Friday. He said he was eager to move beyond the case to other
issues, such as getting Boeing to appoint a ``person of color'' to
its board of directors, and to use minority-run firms to manage its
giant pension fund.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing spokesman Lawrence McCracken declined to confirm that a
settlement had been reached. ``Settlement has always been one of
the options,'' he said. ``We have nothing to announce at this
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The discrimination suit was filed on behalf of 233 workers.
Lawyers were seeking class-action status for 10,000 mostly
African-American employees.
</P>
<P>
   One person involved in the settlement who insisted on anonymity
said that in addition to paying $15 million to the workers, Boeing
agreed to change the way it selects managers, makes promotions and
handles complaints of discrimination. ``They will be letting people
know who got the jobs and why they got them,'' the person said.

LISTENING TO AN EARFUL FOR SAVINGS  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 24)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa., Md., Texas)  (af) 
 By ABBY ELLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that the Internet and its advertisements are almost as
common in the nation's households as microwave ovens, marketers
have found yet another way to lure customers. Instead of waiting
for potential buyers to log on, corporations can make their pitches
whenever consumers pick up the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for their ears, listeners get free long-distance
calls. There are, of course, several drawbacks to such services.
</P>
<P>
   Among the providers is Broadpoint Communications' Freeway, a
``sponsored long-distance phone service'' begun last April in
Pittsburgh and now available nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 80 marketers, including Blockbuster, Toshiba, Acura, the
Flower Club, and TGI Fridays, advertise on the network. Perry
Kamel, 34, president and chief executive of Broadpoint, which is
based in Landover, Md., says the telephone commercials are getting
a friendly reception. ``Unlike a lot of intrusion-based
advertising, this is permission-based,'' Kamel said. ``Members are
volunteering to hear messages in return for tangible value.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's how Freeway works: To subscribe, log on to the company's
Web site (www.broadpoint.com), and fill out a detailed survey that
includes demographic, lifestyle and special-interest questions.
Within a few days, the company sends its toll-free number and a
personal identification code. Dial the number, plug in the code,
and listen to a 10- to 15-second ad.
</P>
<P>
   To hear another ad, press the star key. To place a call, hit
pound. Or follow the prompts to connect to an advertiser's sales
center or to request product samples or brochures. Then press the
star or pound keys to hear more ads or make a call. All the ads are
tailored to individual tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Each message heard earns two minutes of talk time. For a single
call, a customer can bank as many ads as desired. Kamel says most
people listen to an average of seven or eight (building up about 16
minutes of phone time) before making a call. They are warned 30
seconds before their time runs out. The service can be used
anywhere in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Such a sponsored communications service is not unique. Freefone,
based in Houston, offers free local telephone calls from public
booths in which color advertisements are displayed. Free Internet
service is available via Netzero (www.netzero.com), where customers
fill out personal profiles that, as with Freeway, bring appropriate
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Fax4free (www.fax4free.com), scheduled to go online
Sunday, will allow customers to fax from their computers anywhere
in the world for free online stationery that bears advertisements.
Advertising-free faxes will cost a dime or less a page.
</P>
<P>
   But Freeway can be used on any touch-tone phone, and users are
not required to change phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   Freeway finds its customers among those whose money is more
valuable than their time. ``I love it,'' said Michelle Veeck, a
homemaker in Pittsburgh. ``I can rack up 34 minutes of free time
while I'm doing the dishes.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly McGlaughlin, an airline pilot who also lives in
Pittsburgh, says he has cut his long-distance bill from $100 a
month to nothing. ``The ads aren't too bad, though the Pittsburgh
Symphony is annoying because I hear it every day and I never go to
the symphony,'' he said. ``But usually they're kind of cute, and
I've used a few, like TGI Fridays. They're supporting my
long-distance phone habit, why shouldn't I support them?''
</P>
<P>
   Kamel, who was director of strategy at MCI, says nearly a
million people will join Freeway in its first year based on
spreading word of mouth, or what he calls ``virus marketing.'' In
Pittsburgh, roughly 10,000 joined during a 10-month trial. Freeway
publicizes a poll in which about 73 percent of its customers said
they had bought something from its advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Now for the drawbacks. Customers can make only one call before
having to listen to more ads and build back their free time.
Accumulated time cannot be saved for later use. And because Freeway
requires customers to push buttons for the next ad and the next,
they cannot run out to the corner store or get pedicures while the
messages play on.
</P>
<P>
   Callers also have to plan so that they can listen to enough
advertisements before they need to telecommune. McGlaughlin often
calls his wife between 8:30 and 9 p.m., but he must begin preparing
by 8:20.
</P>
<P>
   Customers also risk reaching only voice mail. It can be annoying
to rack up 60 minutes and then get an answering machine,
McGlaughlin says. He often listens to a few ads, calls to make sure
the person he wants to reach is in, then says he will phone back in
20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Inconveniences aside, McGlaughlin said Freeway was a godsend.
``If my free time was worth something, it would be annoying,'' he
said. ``But the other day I sat down and played Tomb Raiser, a
computer game, while listening to the ads, so I was doing something
I would have done anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's not to like?'' he added. ``It's free.''

   A new political shake-up was averted after a key member of the
ruling center-left coalition failed to withdraw his party's

   Britain: Pinochet Case Continues

<P>
   The Law Lords, Britain's highest court, were told that England's
State Immunity Act did not protect Gen. Augusto Pinochet from
arrest, because the crimes against humanity with which he is
charged cannot be considered the functional acts of a head of
state. The argument was made by Ian Brownlie on behalf of Amnesty
International on the fourth day of a rehearing of the former
Chilean dictator's plea to be freed from house arrest and permitted

   Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said France would demand damages

over 10 years if Germany goes ahead with eventual plans to close

   The European Court of Human Rights told France to pay the

courts fined the Parisian weekly $1,200 in 1993 for publishing the

   A dispute over rerouting two streets running past the planned

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a move designed to win NFL support for an L.A.
franchise, billionaire Eli Broad joined the effort Thursday to
bring an expansion team to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   At a Convention Center news conference crowded with city, county
and state officials, Broad said he would become a full partner with
Ed Roski Jr. in financing about 75 percent of the $1 billion-plus
needed to bring a team to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the city of the 21st Century, and Los Angeles should
be home to a National Football League team,'' Broad said. ``(Roski)
and I don't like to lose and I think we have an opportunity here to
win a team.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL is scheduled to hold meetings in February and March to
discuss awarding a franchise for a 32nd team. The Coliseum bid is
in competition with one from Carson developed by Mike Ovitz and a
well-organized and well-financed effort from the city of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main concerns voiced by NFL officials has been
whether Roski could develop the financing needed to make
improvements at the Coliseum _ estimated at $365 million _ as well
as raise the funds to purchase an expansion team at a cost expected
to reach at least $750 million.
</P>
<P>
   Broad's involvement helps solve that.
</P>
<P>
   The founder of Kaufman and Broad home builders, Broad recently
merged his SunAmerica financial investment company for $18.5
billion to the American International Group. It has been estimated
that Broad made $3 billion in that deal.
</P>
<P>
   Broad, 65, said he was approached last year by Councilman Mark
Ridley-Thomas about becoming involved. Recently, Mayor Richard
Riordan began leaning on him.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Broad and Roski will each have 35 to 40
percent of the partnership and want to offer the remaining portion
to others in the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could afford to do this ourselves, but we want more people
involved,'' Broad said. ``If there is no interest, we will do it
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   David Carter, a USC professor and expert on sports economics,
said Broad's announcement represents a huge advance for the
Coliseum effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may be just what they needed to take their case over the
top,'' Carter said. ``He has tremendous community presence, both in
terms of business dealings and his willingness to get involved in
the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you combine that with his sheer amount of money and
affluence, that is sure to get the attention of the NFL. He also is
the kind of industrialist the NFL is looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Broad long has been involved in a variety of community events,
from the Museum of Contemporary Art to reviving the Disney Concert
Hall fund-raising effort. He also is co-chair of the LA Convention
2000 group seeking to host the next Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Broad said Roski will continue to be the front person dealing
with the NFL, but he will attend meetings as warranted. Broad also
will be in charge of the football operations if they win a
franchise, while Roski oversees the construction work and
management of the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Roski leaves this week for meetings with several owners and will
be attending the Super Bowl on Jan. 31 in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan said Broad will provide the financial credibility needed
to convince the NFL that Los Angeles has a viable bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eli Broad has proven time and again that he is a leader when
it comes to getting things done,'' Riordan said.

CLINTON WARNS OF DANGER OF TERRORIST ATTACKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for general rewrite of 1sttake.)   (Eds: See also CLINTON-INTERVIEW-TEXT) 
(mk) 
 By JUDITH MILLER and WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Thursday that it is ``highly
likely'' that a terrorist group will launch or threaten a germ or
chemical attack on U.S. soil within the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in the Oval Office, Clinton said he had been
persuaded by intelligence reports that the United States needs to
bolster its defenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want the American people to know what they need to know
and have a realistic view of this,'' the president said in the
45-minute interview, ``not to be afraid, or asleep. I think that's
the trick.''
</P>
<P>
   Without providing specifics, Clinton warned that any attack with
germ or chemical weapons would prompt ``at least a proportionate if
not a disproportionate response.'' The United States has signed
treaties not to use chemical or germ weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he is weighing a proposal from the Defense
Department to establish a commander in chief for the defense of the
continental United States, a step that civil liberties groups
strongly resist.
</P>
<P>
   Such a program would go far beyond the civil defense measures
and bomb shelters that marked the Cold War, setting up instead a
military leadership to help fight chaos and disarray if an attack
occurred. Pentagon commanders oversee regions around the globe, but
not the continental United States.
</P>
<P>
   Critics fear such moves could open the door to rising military
influence and a loss of individual rights, but Clinton insisted
that such erosions would never occur.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton gave the interview as his lawyers ended their defense
presentation at his impeachment trial in the Senate. Since the
Monica Lewinsky issue surfaced a year ago, the president has given
almost no interviews to major U.S. news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   With his presidency under fire, it is unclear how much of the
proposed new military funds _ more than $2 billion _ Clinton will
be able to get through the Republican-dominated Congress. But
Congress has usually supported White House efforts to fight
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the political pressures, Clinton appeared relaxed and
deeply engaged in the complex scientific and policy issues raised
by what the White House has called 21st-century threats. He smiled
repeatedly, yet spoke of spending sleepless nights pondering new
security challenges after the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Clinton said he hoped a major legacy of his
presidency would be to stave off unconventional attacks. He said he
would delighted if, decades later, Americans look back on any such
threat as ``the dog that didn't bark.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton described how he had come to see germ, chemical and
computer attacks as the greatest emerging threat to national
security, and the White House said Thursday that he would propose
$2.8 billion in his next budget to fight such terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Clinton plans to announce the administration's
program to combat exotic forms of terrorism, which he said would
dominate national defense in the next century. The steps include
developing new vaccines, stockpiling antibiotics, and setting up
emergency medical teams in major cities and a corps of computer
experts who could respond quickly to electronic attacks.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that of all the new threats, the one that ``keeps
me awake at night'' is the possibility of germ attack. ``A chemical
attack would be horrible, but it would be finite,'' he said, adding
that it would not spread. But a biological attack could spread, he
added, ``kind of like the gift that keeps on giving.''
</P>
<P>
   During Clinton's presidency, terrorism has emerged as one of the
nation's thorniest security challenges, its dangers more diffuse
than those of the Cold War yet more immediate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he had begun worrying about biological terrorism
and other unconventional threats six years ago, in February 1993,
after Islamic radicals exploded a bomb under the World Trade Center
in New York. The bombing killed six people and injured more than
1,000.
</P>
<P>
   He said his concerns about the danger of germ or chemical attack
were deepened by reports that Iraq had retained some chemical
weapons and by the activities of a Japanese cult, Aum Shinrikyo,
which attacked the Tokyo subway system in 1995 with a nerve agent,
killing 12 and injuring 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he thought it was more likely that a rogue state
would more likely attack American surrogates overseas than wage
terrorism in the United States itself.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Osama bin Laden, a Saudi fugitive who is accused
of masterminding the U.S. embassy bombings in Africa in August, has
``made an effort to get chemical weapons'' and ``may have'' tried
to get germ weapons. ``We don't know that they have them,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said ``a lot of what we've done already,'' some of it
secret, ``has delayed'' foreign efforts to develop and deploy
chemical, biological or nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   He said that ultimately, the best defense against unconventional
warfare and biological terrorism in particular would be scientific
strides in deciphering the genetic material in microbes and humans,
so vaccines could be tailored for quick response to an attack.
</P>
<P>
   This, he said, would allow the defense to stay ahead of the
offense. His hope, he said, was that the United States would use
``each new wave of technology to close the gap between offense and
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, he endorsed the Human Genome Project, a costly
federally funded effort to map human genetic material, saying it
would be an important part of the shield that his administration is
building.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's personal interest in the threat, aides agree, has
become a powerful force behind secret meetings, actions and
directives meant to bolster antiterrorism work and to counter what
aides describe as a growing danger to civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The budget outlined by the White House Thursday, to be formally
presented by the president on Friday at the National Academy of
Sciences, includes $10 billion to defend against terrorism, weapons
of mass destruction and ``cyber attacks,'' according to the White
House statement.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the money _ about $8.5 billion _ is earmarked for the
defense of American embassies and other buildings and personnel
against conventional weapons like car and truck bombs. The rest is
divided among existing and new programs to counter biological,
chemical and computer attacks, especially those that could cripple
key parts of the government or the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two years, the administration has almost doubled
the money spent to protect Americans against attacks with
unconventional weapons. In fiscal 1998, this budget was $770
million; in the new budget, it rises to $1,336 million.

A SECRET MEETING SWAYED THE KNICKS ON SPREWELL  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Four men from the Knicks' organization boarded a
flight last Sunday for a meeting in Milwaukee. They drove to an
undisclosed location, sat down with Latrell Sprewell and grilled
him.
</P>
<P>
   Three Knick executives _ Dave Checketts, Ernie Grunfeld, Ed
Tapscott _ and Coach Jeff Van Gundy peppered Sprewell with
questions. They asked him about his family, his hoop dreams and the
rage that caused him to choke and threaten Golden State Coach P.J.
Carlesimo on Dec. 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It took two hours. They knew Sprewell. Or they thought they knew
him well enough to send John Starks, Terry Cummings and Chris Mills
to Golden State in a deal that was completed Thursday as National
Basketball Association teams' training camps opened.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the trade, Checketts Thursday defended the
controversial decision. At the same time, he defended himself from
those who find the move hypocritical after Checketts had spoken two
years earlier about putting a wholesome product on the Madison
Square Garden floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot has happened in my thinking over the last 48 hours or
so,'' Checketts said in a conference call. ``To make the statements
I have about not wanting certain players on my team or on our team,
I guess I'd have to say that was pretty judgmental and almost
self-righteous, and I regret having said those things. It's not
fair for me to judge what people have gone through. I'll make a
comment about Dennis Rodman here that has nothing to do with our
interest in him, but I did make a statement about not having him on
our club a couple of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when he was brought into Chicago, and he was surrounded by
a very strong coach and very strong players, he was no small part
of helping them win two championships. At the final hour, I just
said: `We really owe it to the fans of New York and the Knicks to
do everything I can to win. This is a team that has been eliminated
in the second round the last four years. And you just don't get a
chance to get a talent like this.'''
</P>
<P>
   However, that does not mean the Knicks are ready to cozy up to
Rodman, who has let it be known that he would like to play in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Knicks need a rebounder. Yes, they have a salary cap
exception to use on him. Yes, they have shown character is not
always an issue. But Checketts and Grunfeld, without explaining how
the Sprewell image issues are different than Rodman's, said the
team was not looking to sign him.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Sprewell said in his meeting with the Knicks on Sunday
_ details of which were not disclosed _ it was enough. Checketts
and his people left Milwaukee with the belief that Sprewell had
shown them enough contrition for his past and enough excitement
about a future in New York to warrant the risk.
</P>
<P>
   But his debut in a Knick uniform was on hold Thursday. Sprewell
was said to be in town by early evening, but he was not expected to
attend the Knicks' first session Thursday night. First, he has to
meet with Commissioner David Stern and the union executive
director, Billy Hunter, in order to meet their threshold for
re-entry into the league following his suspension for choking his
coach. After that, he has to pass a physical.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, he will have to pass the scrutiny he is sure to be under.
The Knicks grilled him with questions, performed a background check
and talked to those close to Sprewell. But that doesn't mean he
will hold up under the pressure of playing in New York. Every miss
or make will be documented for a three-time All-Star who will be
asked to fit in _ and not ruffle anyone by taking over _ when he
steps on the Garden floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't played in a while, so he might be rusty,'' said
Grunfeld, referring to the nearly 14-month layoff Sprewell has had
from the game because of his suspension and the lockout. ``But
we'll have patience with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Patience is not a plentiful quality in New York. The Knicks are
constantly asked to hurry up and win a title. And Sprewell will be
asked to hurry up and deliver for that cause without a public
misstep along the way. The pressure to win and produce now also led
to the Knicks' decision to take a chance on Sprewell, regardless of
how unlikable the team appears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think given the order of priority, we want to win,''
Checketts said. ``We want to win as much as we can, as often as we
can. We want to win championships. That's what we strive for. Along
that path, we want an organization that can showcase players who
are great people and people kids can emulate and see as role
models. I know I've set myself up for this difficult issue. But I
haven't changed on that. We'd like to have an organization that has
pride and character and that wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in New York, people love winners. And winning is a
priority here. It's not winning at all cost, which some have said
is what this move is all about. It's not about that. But this is
about giving an extraordinary talent another chance and surrounding
him with an organization that can help him be part of a winner.
That's what we're trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Two hours in Milwaukee were enough for the Knicks to believe the
acquisition of Sprewell is worth the try.

<P>
   Following are excerpts from ``Special Report: Massacre of
Civilians in Racak,'' compiled by international monitors who were
in the village before and after the killings on Jan. 15. K.V.M. is
Kosovo Verification Mission; K.L.A. is the Kosovo Liberation Army;
V.J. is Yugoslav Army.
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 8. The police informed the K.V.M. of a K.L.A. attack on
police vehicles near Dulje (west of Stimlje). A K.V.M. patrol
already in the area had heard the shooting and on investigation
found the scene of an ambush against police vehicles. Two policemen
were dead and another two wounded. Three Albanian civilians in a
taxi were also wounded. It appears they had inadvertently driven
into the ambush. K.V.M. evacuated an injured policeman and the
three civilians to Prizren hospital. Later, K.V.M. were informed
that one of the wounded policemen had died, raising the total
fatalities to three. Prizren Regional Center comments that this was
a well-prepared ambush. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 14. K.V.M. patrols received reports of bombardments of the
villages of Javor and Luznica (northwest of Stimlje).
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 15. The K.V.M. reported a serious deterioration of the
situation in the Stimlje area. Racak, Malopoljce, Petrova and
Belince villages (south and west of Stimlje) were all affected.
Verifiers saw houses burning in Racak and Malopoljce. K.V.M.
patrols witnessed V.J. tanks and armored vehicles firing directly
into houses near Malopoljce and Petrova. V.J. and police forces
prevented K.V.M. patrols from entering the area, but late in the
afternoon a K.V.M. patrol did get to the village of Racak.
Verifiers saw one dead Albanian civilian and five injured
civilians, including a woman and a boy suffering from gunshot
wounds. The K.V.M. also received unconfirmed reports of other
deaths. Residents of Racak claimed that men had been segregated
from women and children and that 20 males had been arrested and
taken away. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 16. K.V.M. teams that included human rights verifiers went
to Racak village. . . . By 1250 hours, the first confirmed reports
were received of civilians having been killed. The accounts of
surviving residents said that the killing had taken place of Jan.
15. They said that following V.J. and police attacks, security
forces had entered Racak at approximately 0700 hours. . . . They
claimed these forces had executed some residents and detained
others. Additionally, the survivors reported that they recognized
some of the policemen as being from Stimlje. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The first K.V.M. teams to arrive in Racak on Jan. 16 in the
early morning found the following:
</P>
<P>
   _ Twenty-three adult males of various ages. Many shot at
extremely close range, most shot in the front, back and top of the
head. Villagers reported that these victims were last seen alive
when the police were arresting them. . . .
</P>
<P>
   _ Three adults males shot in various parts of their body
including their backs. They appeared to have been shot when running
away. . . .
</P>
<P>
   _ One adult male shot outside his house with his head missing. .
. .
</P>
<P>
   _ One adult male shot in head and decapitated. All the flesh was
missing from the skull.
</P>
<P>
   _ One adult female shot in the back. . . .
</P>
<P>
   _ One boy (12 years old) shot in the neck.
</P>
<P>
   _ One male, late teens (shot in abdomen).

 New Marching Orders  &HT;       
 By Jamie Beckett 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
It's hard enough hiring high-priced engineers in Silicon Valley's
tight job market. Try finding workers for blue-collar jobs that
don't pay much and usually are temporary.
</P>
<P>
   But database-maker Oracle Corp. and a handful of other Silicon
Valley firms have found an inventive solution by casting their nets
beyond the usual pool of high-tech workers. No newly minted
engineers here, and nobody who's heard the headhunter's call.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Oracle has put a group of unemployed military veterans
to work _ and reaped some surprising benefits.
</P>
<P>
   At Oracle's distribution plant in Belmont, more than 25 veterans
work by packing, sorting and shipping Oracle software to customers
all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to hire people right out of college. There was a high
turnover, and when people left, the jobs were hard to fill,'' said
Brian Ernst, who manages Oracle's manufacturing organization. ``The
big change is that we have people here who want to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   The veterans all come through Next Step, a Menlo Park nonprofit
affiliated with the U.S. Veterans Administration. Next Step is the
primary job-placement and training agency for military veterans in
San Mateo and Santa Clara counties.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle began recruiting vets in 1995. Now with Silicon Valley's
job market growing increasingly tight, more companies are tapping
the vets as a resource, said Rose Sutton, operations manager at
Next Step.
</P>
<P>
   The former soldiers and sailors working at Oracle are a far cry
from the recent grads Oracle used to hire for its warehouse. These
are people who've seen hard times. Some were homeless. Some were
alcoholics or drug addicts. Some lost longtime jobs, spouses,
children.
</P>
<P>
   The vets have served in all branches of service and all over the
world _ in Vietnam, Panama, the Philippines or, closer to home, at
places like Fort Hood, Texas, or Fort Ord in Monterey. For some,
experiences in the military or the difficulties of adjusting to
civilian life led to personal problems or trouble finding a job.
Others simply lost jobs and were lucky enough to have Next Step as
a resource.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Robert Merwin, 36, a former Army combat engineer. He
was homeless and strung out on ``everything but heroin'' after he
graduated from Chico State in 1990. He had no job, no car and most
of his friends didn't want to talk to him. Merwin said he was
contemplating suicide when he placed a desperate call to his
father, a retired Navy officer who took him to the Veterans
Administration center in Menlo Park.
</P>
<P>
   After going through recovery, he became Oracle's first vet
``temp'' worker in January 1995. Seven months later, Oracle made
him a permanent employee. Now, he manages the Belmont packing and
shipping operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I've been given a second chance in life,'' he
said. ``You can learn from life's experiences, or you can let them
defeat you.''
</P>
<P>
   Next Step is much more than a job-placement agency. It provides
whatever vets need to be ready to work _ affordable housing,
transportation, computer training and interviewing. The agency
assesses vets' individual needs, strengths and weaknesses and tries
to match each with the company that's the best fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know our guys better than most of their relatives will know
them,'' said Rose Sutton, Next Step operations manager. ``What an
employer is looking for now is more than experience. Especially in
the Valley, they want people who match the personality of the
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Those people tend to be happier and more productive workers, she
said. Temporary assignments last three to 11 months. After that,
companies either hire the vets as permanent workers or send them
back to Next Step, where they may receive more training or a
referal to another employer. Since 1989, Next Step has provided job
help to 5,500 vets, about 4,400 of whom went on to permanent or
temporary jobs.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of VETS22 (69403 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Employers include software-maker Intuit, medical equipment-maker
Acuson, Stanford University and Stanford University Medical Center.
Although most of the vets work in warehouse jobs or in maintenance,
some have gone on to be computer technicians, programmers or even
chefs. The average wage is $9.58 an hour, though programmers and
workers with technical skills earn between $20 and $30 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   At Oracle, nearly all the vets work inside the distribution
plant alongside a gleaming silver conveyor belt that snakes
throughout the warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Many start out filling orders, selecting the right software and
documentation for each of the blue, red or gray bins that rumble
along the assembly line.
</P>
<P>
   Once the bins are filled, another set of workers checks to make
sure each contains the materials that a customer has ordered. The
bins then are stacked on pallets, packed in boxes and shipped
around the world. Besides working the line, the vets learn to use
computers for things like entering and tracking orders.
</P>
<P>
   The vets have been an asset to Oracle _ and not just as a source
of ready labor, said Matt Mayerson, vice president of manufacturing
and distribution at Oracle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're proud of the fact that we're able to support a community
program, but it's more than making a charitable gesture,'' he said.
``Employees who come from the veterans' program are very committed,
very creative, dedicated and reliable.''
</P>
<P>
   They also have contributed useful ideas that have made Oracle's
operations more efficient, he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's due to the extensive experience some of the vets have had
with military-supply operations. For instance, one vet suggested a
way to keep software documentation _ paper instructions for using
the software _ from getting crinkled and damaged when it is
tumbling along the assembly line with heavy boxes of software. Now,
the documentation is held in a plastic protective sleeve inside the
bin.
</P>
<P>
   Another vet suggested using pencils to mark boxes to keep ink
stains from getting on boxes.
</P>
<P>
   The vets say Oracle keeps them on their toes, encouraging them
to learn new skills and move up.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Decker, 51, who served as a helicopter pilot in the Vietnam
War, had lost his job of 25 years at a major supermarket, but then
a federal unemployment-claims worker suggested that he go to Next
Step. He started ``picking and packing,'' essentially filling bins
with customers' orders.
</P>
<P>
   Decker moved up and then up again and now works as ``operations
lead,'' allocating workers to wherever they're needed in the
warehouse. Early this month, he became a permanent Oracle employee,
with a salary and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``People take an interest in you,'' Decker said. ``They see
qualifications you might not think you had.''

 Pacific Bell Consumers Tell Tales of Woe  &HT;       
 By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Consumers and employee groups began presenting their case against
Pacific Bell yesterday, telling state regulators the company has
engaged in deceptive sales practices, misled customers and created
an atmosphere of fear for its workers.
</P>
<P>
   In the first day of hearings before the state Public Utilities
Commission, witnesses testified that Pac Bell provided incorrect or
misleading information to customers about services such as Caller
ID.
</P>
<P>
   A PUC judge is overseeing the hearings, which continue through
at least Tuesday, and will issue a proposed decision within a few
weeks. The full commission is not expected to vote on the decision
until later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Bell will begin presenting its witnesses on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The hearings stem from complaints filed by consumers and
advocacy groups who contend that since Pac Bell was bought by SBC
Communications in 1997, it has adopted an aggressive sales policy
that requires service representatives to meet sales quotas and
badger callers into buying extra services.
</P>
<P>
   The consumer groups are asking the PUC to issue a
cease-and-desist order requiring Pac Bell to stop its high-pressure
sales tactics.
</P>
<P>
   The case is similar to one filed against Pac Bell several years
ago, before it was acquired by SBC. In 1986, state regulators
ordered Pac Bell to refund $63 million to customers misled by sales
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers representing Pac Bell said the company does want to sell
products but is not misleading customers or violating any law.
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys attempted to poke holes in the opposition's case,
saying many of the documents presented by the consumer groups were
``dubious'' and that there is no outcry by customers about Pac
Bell's pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should be about whether we're complying with regulation
and the law set forth for us,'' said Doug Michelman, a spokesman
for Pac Bell. ``Not everybody takes to change well, and it's not
surprising that some employees haven't adapted. But there is no
consumer outrage and we haven't violated any law.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of PACBELL2 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Charles Carbone, an attorney with the Utility Consumer Action
Network, disagreed and said the company is deliberately misleading
customers.
</P>
<P>
   For example, customers were not given complete information about
Caller ID blocking options.
</P>
<P>
   One option, complete blocking, prevents the callers' phone
numbers from showing up on the Caller ID box of the person they're
calling.
</P>
<P>
   Another option, selective blocking, only blocks the callers'
phone number when they first dial 67 before each call.
</P>
<P>
   But according to Carbone, many Pac Bell customers were only told
about selective blocking, not complete blocking.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, they were told complete blocking no longer
exists, Carbone said.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell discourages complete blocking because it makes it
harder to sell Caller ID equipment and services.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell is required to offer complete blocking to customers at
no charge. But Colleen O'Grady, an attorney representing Pac Bell,
said the company does not have to tell new customers about any kind
of blocking services, unless they specifically ask about Caller ID.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no law that says we have to proactively offer
complete blocking,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints about Caller ID services began long before
December, when Business Response Inc. of St. Louis, a telemarketing
firm hired by Pac Bell, began cold calling customers about Caller
ID. Pac Bell fired BRI this week after receiving complaints about
misleading calls.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Bogisich, a service representative for Pac Bell, said
employees are given incentives for getting customers to dump the
blocking feature.
</P>
<P>
   ``They offer us $10 gift certificates to stores or other prizes
if we can get people to get rid of blocking,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The company also offered its own service representatives free
phone services at home, such as Caller ID and call waiting, if they
got rid of complete blocking on their home phones.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of PACBELL2 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  O'Grady acknowledged there are incentives for employees, but said
the union representing the workers agreed to that plan.
</P>
<P>
   That union, the Telecommunications International Union, has
filed a complaint against Pac Bell on behalf of its workers, saying
employees work in a climate of fear and are continually harassed.
</P>
<P>
   According to documents filed with the PUC, the motto for Pac
Bell service reps is ``Sell high, watch 'em buy. Sell low, no place
to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Service representatives like Norma Russell have gone out on
stress leave and eventually retired after feeling badgered by
managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a daily basis, people would head to the bathroom crying
because of the pressure,'' said Russell, who lives in Chico (Butte
County). ``It's just a constant harassment.''
</P>
<P>
   The company insists it treats its employees well and said it has
not created a climate of fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a contentious labor dispute with TIU,'' O'Grady said.
``Most of the service reps will agree with us that they are treated
well.''

IN THE PRESIDENT'S WORDS: ASSESSING THE RISKS OF GERM WARFARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: With CLINTON-INTERVIEW-GERM) 
(mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from an interview with
President Clinton on the threat of biological and chemical weapons,
conducted Thursday by The New York Times, as transcribed by the
White House:
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: How worried should we be? Is this serious today, and
is the threat rising? Is it going to be more serious in the future?
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON: I would say that if the issue is how probable is it in
the very near term, an American city or community would be
affected, I'd say you probably shouldn't be too worried.
</P>
<P>
   But if the issue is, is it a near certainty that at some time in
the future there will be some group, probably a terrorist group,
that attempts to bring to bear either the use or the threat of a
chemical or biological operation, I would say that is highly likely
to happen sometime in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   And therefore, I would say the appropriate response is not worry
or panic, but taking this issue very seriously ... and then to try
to make sure we are doing everything we can to stop this.
</P>
<P>
   Now, we know right now _ we know that a lot of what we've done
already has delayed WMD (weapons of mass destruction) programs,
some of which I can't talk about, but slowed the development of WMD
programs of missile technology development that might deliver such
weapons and other things. And we're doing everything we can to stop
or slow down the ability of others insofar as we know about it and
can do something about it. And meanwhile we're doing everything we
can both to develop defenses and emergency responses.
</P>
<P>
   But I think we've got an enormous amount of work out there ahead
of us, an enormous amount of work.
</P>
<P>
   And a lot of this has to be done with great cooperation between
the federal government. We need cooperation of the private sector
on the cyber issues, the computer issues. We need cooperation with
local government on public health response issues, exposure _ if
there appears to be an outbreak. We had all these sort of false
alarms of anthrax in California _ how many? More than a dozen I
think in the last month. So we need to be able to diagnose and to
treat and also to manage those things.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Does one of these threats worry you more than another, and
does any one in particular keep you awake at night?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, I have spent some late nights thinking a lot about this
and reading a lot about it. I think in terms of offense vs.
defense, if you go back to where we started, the thing that I'm
most interested in _ and you will see we've allocated several
hundred million dollars basically to research and to applied
research _ the thing that I'm most interested in, is developing the
ability to quickly contain biological agents.
</P>
<P>
   A chemical attack would be horrible, but it would be finite. You
know, it's just like _ for the people who went through Oklahoma
City, nothing could be more horrible. But it didn't spread. And the
thing that bothers people about biological agents is that, unless
they're properly diagnosed, contained and treated, that it could
spread.
</P>
<P>
   For example, we know that if all of us went to a rally on the
Mall tomorrow with 10,000 people, and somebody flew a low-flying
crop duster and sprayed us all with biological agents from, let's
say, 200 feet, that no matter how toxic it were, half of us would
walk away for reasons no one quite understands. You know, either we
wouldn't breathe it, or we'd have some miraculous resistance to it.
And the other half of us, somebody would have to diagnose in a
hurry and then contain and treat ...
</P>
<P>
   I'm not trying to be macabre, but you asked me what keeps me
awake at night, and that bothers me. And that's why the thing that
I thought was most important about what we did last year, and what
we learned a little bit from our defense scare _ even though it was
on a computer issue, we had this defense issue, plus we were
dealing with all this _ we'd studied for a year all this _
especially this biological issue _ is we had this work going on in
12 different places in the government. So we had to organize our
efforts, so that we could be accessible to local governments, so we
could work with them, to set up their own preventive mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
   And I have to tell you, it may be ... that we may have to have a
perfect defense. I mean, instantaneous. We may have to depend upon
the Genome Project, interestingly enough, because once the human
genes' secrets are unlocked, then _if you and I think we've been
infected, they could take a blood sample, and there would be a
computer program which would show us if we had _ let's say we had a
variant of anthrax. Let's suppose some terrorist hired a genius
scientist and a laboratory to take basic anthrax and put some
variant in it that would be resistant to all known anthrax
antidotes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. OK. Or a Russian scientist.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. So let's just suppose that happened. And what you would
want is to be able to take a blood sample, do an analysis, put it
through a software program that had already been developed ... this
is how you should, how you should change the vaccine.

 Inquiring Minds Wonder If Dayton Hudson Will Sell Mervyn's  &HT;       
 By Mark Veverka  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Is Dayton Hudson closer to unloading Mervyn's?
</P>
<P>
   Rumors persist that Dayton Hudson has held discussions with
Kohl's, a growing chain of department stores, about selling either
some or all of the Mervyn's stores.
</P>
<P>
   Two scenarios are floating around. One is that Kohl's would
acquire the real estate rights to nearly all of Mervyn's 268
locations. The other is that the suburban Milwaukee chain wants to
cherry-pick particular locations, especially those outside of
California.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, investors seem to think something is in the works.
Dayton Hudson shares have soared to a 52-week high of $58.94, up 37
percent since the day before Thanksgiving. (You may recall that
retail news was dreary in December as unseasonably warm weather
hurt early holiday sales.) Kohl's stock fell yesterday $1.06 to
$60.94.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor that could be propping up Dayton Hudson shares,
however, is the company's recent announcement to buy back about $1
billion worth of its own stock.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if a Dayton Hudson-Kohl's deal goes down, it would likely
be limited to brick-and-mortar and would not be an all-encompassing
acquisition involving Mervyn's operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not buy companies,'' says Kohl's Executive Vice
President Gary Vasques.
</P>
<P>
   But Kohl's does buy real estate, and Mervyn's' locations would
suit the retailer quite well. Kohl's is a Wall Street darling that
has outperformed Mervyn's at its own game _ operating department
stores that sell moderately priced merchandise. It must continue to
grow in order keep investors happy, and most Mervyn's stores are in
unchartered waters for Kohl's.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Dayton Hudson and its employees, a
real-estate-only deal would mean that Mervyn's would have to close
its operations at stores it was selling and write them down as a
loss.
</P>
<P>
   Vasques would neither confirm nor deny that Kohl's is in
discussions with Dayton Hudson regarding Mervyn's. Vasques would
only say: ``We have announced no plans to acquire any Mervyn's
locations.'' A Dayton Hudson spokeswoman would not comment, but
employees at Mervyn's corporate headquarters in Hayward say
speculation about a potential deal with Kohl's gets louder each
day. And where there's smoke, there's often some high-priced
adviser's Macanudo smoldering in a backroom ashtray.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of STREET22 (93510 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  One thing is clear, a deal like this would make eminent sense for
both parties because Dayton Hudson needs to sell and Kohl's is the
perfect buyer. Investment bankers and real estate sources say the
two, at the very least, have danced together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be that Dayton Hudson is asking too high a price.
(But) eventually Mervyn's is going to go,'' says one New York
investment banker that specializes in retail deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were Kohl's, I would be a bottom fisher on this,'' says
the banker.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Kohl's expansion plate is full, and the company has
the luxury of waiting-out Dayton Hudson for a lower price.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl's is known for its disciplined approach to growth and
hasn't expressed any urgent need to expand into California, where
nearly half of Mervyn's stores are located. Also, Kohl's is
reportedly taking over some store leases from Caldor, a beleaguered
discount chain in the East.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl's is pushing eastward and westward from its Midwestern
base, adding about 40 stores this year mostly in the mid-Atlantic
region and near Denver. (Incidently, Mervyn's has 11 locations in
Colorado.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, prime retail real estate in the Golden State is scarce,
especially in urban areas, and Kohl's can't afford an opportunity
like this to slip by.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the clock is ticking for Dayton Hudson. It has
been about four months since company officials expressed that it
would consider getting rid of its underperforming Mervyn's unit
during the next 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   For more than half this decade, Dayton Hudson shareholders have
been crying for management to shed Mervyn's and/or its department
store unit in order to unlock the value of its powerhouse Target
discount store division, says financial analyst Joseph Ronning of
Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least for shareholders, there's light at the end of the
tunnel,'' Ronning says.

cup,'' the unidentified sexual practice mentioned in  &UR; Tom &LR; 
 &UR; Wolfe &LR; 's ``A Man in Full,'' first determine which partner plays
what role. Then the designee picks up the cup and ``very gently
places the open end against the wall of the motel room and his or

then whisper to the other what is going on with the couple in the

<P>
   &UR; Randy Alfred &LR;  says that practitioners of ``that thing with the
cup,'' the unidentified sexual practice mentioned in  &UR; Tom &LR; 
 &UR; Wolfe &LR; 's ``A Man in Full,'' first determine which partner plays
what role. Then the designee picks up the cup and ``very gently
places the open end against the wall of the motel room and his or
her ear next to the outside bottom of the cup. This partner must
then whisper to the other what is going on with the couple in the
next room.''
</P>
<P>
   And  &UR; Robert Wallace &LR;  remembered that ``Gimme Some,'' a song sung
by Nina Simone about 30 years ago, includes the lyric, ``Come over

HYDE TELLS HIS WAR STORY IN RESPONSE TO BUMPERS 
</HEADLINE>

 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A week after he appealed for President Clinton to
be removed from office on behalf of the nation's fallen veterans,
Rep. Henry Hyde told his own war story Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to personalize these things at all,'' Hyde told
reporters after former Sen. Dale Bumpers invoked the many war
veterans in the Senate to close the White House case against
impeachment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm a World War II combat veteran,'' Hyde said. ``I hit
the beaches under Japanese fire, and I know what I was fighting
for. I was fighting for freedom and to have an opportunity, the
same as anybody else, to make a life for myself. Justice, the rule
of law _ that's just a phrase that encompasses equal protection of
the law and opportunity for everybody. And I believe that's what
every GI fought for.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's news conference amounted to an unusually personal
response to the impassioned Bumpers, a former Democratic senator
from Arkansas who questioned whether the House prosecutors had any
compassion for Clinton and who used his speech to tell his own war
story as a way of showing that the prosecutors had no monopoly on
patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   Emotional himself, Hyde, R-Ill., said: ``My God, you'd be
inhuman if you didn't have any compassion for what the president is
going through, and his family. I certainly understand it. But we
have a constitutional duty to perform, and we're trying the best we
can with a hostile environment to do our job.''
</P>
<P>
   His sense of humor eventually returned when he was asked whether
the political environment had become even more hostile in recent
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, but we're getting more used to it,'' he joked. ``I just
think a lot of people wish we would just go away. But we can't,
because the law won't let us and our sense of duty won't let us.
We're going to see this thing through until they shut the door on
us.''

JUDGE CONVICTS, SENTENCES BROTHER OF FORMER MEXICAN PRESIDENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ANDREW DOWNIE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY_ Ending one of the most dramatic trials in Mexican
history, a judge Thursday convicted the elder brother of Mexico's
former president of masterminding the murder of a top ruling party
politician and sentenced him to a maximum 50 years in prison &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In the ruling, Judge Ricardo Ojeda found Raul Salinas de
Gortari, the brother of former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari,
guilty of planning and organizing the murder of his one-time
brother-in-law, Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz Massieu, then secretary general in the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, that has ruled Mexico since 1929, was
gunned down on a Mexico City street in September 1994. Salinas,
whose sister was once married to Ruiz Massieu, was arrested and
charged with the crime five months later.
</P>
<P>
   According to transcripts of the verdict read on Mexican radio,
Ojeda said that while there was little clear proof linking Salinas
to the crime, incriminating evidence from the trigger man and
Salinas's close relationship with another alleged conspirator
Manuel Munoz Rocha were the deciding factors in his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is scant direct evidence to show that Raul was guilty,''
the judge's report read. ``However, this has been shown through
circumstantial evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The verdict delighted prosecutors, many of whom doubted they
would get a conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything led us to believe it would go the other way,'' said
one official, ``but look, there you go. You never know.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision was all the more surprising given that prosecutors
never gave a convincing motive for the murder in their 1,338
folders of evidence, defense lawyers and experts agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the courtroom in the central city of Toluca about 40
miles from Mexico City, Salinas' lawyers said that they were
convinced of their client's innocence and had already filed an
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raul Salinas was prepared for this,'' attorney Raul Gonzalez
said. ``He is absolutely prepared to keep fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   Salinas' arrest, coupled with a backlash against his failed
economic policies, prompted brother Carlos to flee into
self-imposed exile just days afterward. Carlos Salinas now lives in
Ireland and has never been charged with any crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The case against his brother, however, continued in his absence
even though it was widely held to have been a shaky one.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the prosecution's case centered around the testimony of
a former congressional employee who failed even to implicate
Salinas during his initial statement. Since that first
interrogation, the man changed his story more than half a dozen
times, including once just a week before the Federal Attorney
General's office paid his sister half a million dollars. He was
then sentenced to 50 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Other testimony and witnesses are similarly tainted, defense
lawyers said. The alleged coconspirator whose friendship with
Salinas the judge cited as key, turned up missing days after the
murder and has not been seen since. He is believed to have been
murdered.
</P>
<P>
   At least two more key witnesses were paid thousands of dollars
and one, Salinas's raven-haired Spanish mistress who turned against
him, was given a car and a monthly stipend by then-lead prosecutor
Pablo Chapa. Chapa's boss, former Federal Attorney General Antonio
Lozano, has admitted paying out hundreds of thousands of dollars to
witnesses, and Chapa was captured on videotape coaching witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most humiliating episodes for the prosecution was the
discovery that prosecutors paid a shady astrologer to bury parts of
a skeleton in the garden of Salinas' Mexico City ranch. Chapa paid
the astrologer, a rotund mystic known as La Paca, to tell reporters
she saw the man, the missing former congressman, being beaten to
death by Salinas.
</P>
<P>
   Forensic tests later proved that La Paca had dug up her
son-in-law's father, planted his body on Salinas's ranch and tried
to pass it off as the key witness.
</P>
<P>
   The incident humiliated the Federal Attorney General's office
and the opposition National Action Party for whom Chapa and Lozano
worked. The incident was a key factor in the decision to fire both
men and in Chapa's decision to flee Mexico shortly afterward. He
was later arrested in Spain and returned to Mexico where he
currently awaits trial on charges that include abuse of authority
and illegal exhumation.
</P>
<P>
   The Salinas case and the network of corruption and squalor that
surrounded it symbolized all that was wrong with the Mexican
government and was credited with playing a major role in the
advance of the opposition parties in the years since.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans were furious at Salinas and his ruling party, some
members of whom were allegedly informed that Raul was using his
privileged position as a top official in a government food for the
poor agency to steal millions of dollars. While earning around
$90,000 a year in the job, Salinas deposited tens of millions of
dollars into Swiss bank accounts and bought dozens of houses,
apartments, ranches and other properties.
</P>
<P>
   Nine months after arresting him on the homicide charge, Mexican
prosecutors filed other charges against Salinas, including money
laundering and illicit enrichment after finding more than $100
million in foreign bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   A tax evasion, a money laundering charge and one illicit
enrichment charge were dismissed by a judge, but Salinas still
faces other illicit enrichment accusations. Investigators said last
fall they found new documents and accounts that show Salinas'
illicit fortune to be around $250 million and 123 properties.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas' lawyers deny the charges and accuse Swiss and Mexican
prosecutors of colluding to frame their client.

TEXAS DEATH SPARKS TV REPORT ON WHITE SUPREMACY IN U.S. 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Documentary airs Monday night) 
 
By MIKE McDANIEL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It started with a small article in a London newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   BBC journalist Zab Chughtai read the story last June about the
horrific death of Jasper, Texas, resident James Byrd Jr. How he was
walking home from visiting relatives. How he was accosted, beaten
and chained by his ankles to a pickup. How he was dragged for two
miles, leaving a trail of blood and flesh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born after the civil rights struggle,'' said Chughtai,
31, ``and I didn't expect to read the story of a dragging-to-death
of a man apparently because of the color of his skin. Not in my
lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a story that crossed national boundaries _ racial
problems are not only something Americans are suffering from. James
Byrd's murder led me to research the white supremacy movement in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   The product of her research is ``A Murder in Texas: Hate on
Trial,'' a one-hour documentary to air Monday night on Discovery
Channel. The report is remarkably deep in sources and includes rare
interviews with William Pierce, author of the notorious ``The
Turner Diaries''; Richard Butler, founder of the neo-Nazi group
Aryan Nations; and Charles Lee, grand dragon of the Texas Knights
of the Ku Klux Klan.
</P>
<P>
   Even more remarkable: Chughtai got those racists to speak to
her, the daughter of Pakistani parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I rang the white supremacy organizations and got through
to their leaders, I obviously had to be straight with them, and I
told them my name was Zab,'' said Chughtai. ``It's clearly not an
Anglo-Saxon name, despite my English accent. (She was born in
northern England.) In fact, the English accent comes with a brown
face.''
</P>
<P>
   Her concern, she said, was not a fear for her safety as much as
a fear that the project would be jeopardized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not want to lose the interviews, nor did I want the
interviewees to self-edit when they had to sit and answer questions
from someone with black hair, black eyes and a brown face,'' she
said. (Her crew _ producer, cameraman, sound man _ was white.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the characters I spoke to were interested in whether I
was dark-skinned or olive-skinned or pale-skinned.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Chughtai won them over. She believes she succeeded
because she was straight with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them that I'm a storyteller trying to tell a story,
that my race is completely irrelevant as far as I am concerned and
it should be irrelevant to you.''
</P>
<P>
   She guaranteed them nothing, and no money changed hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' she said, ``the issue of money was raised, but you
can't pay these people to talk, nor can you promise that certain
things will not be used. You have to be completely straight. I
couldn't afford not to be. Ultimately they will see this
documentary, and they're dangerous characters.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from espousing the views of white supremacists, ``Murder in
Texas'' is balanced by interviews with the likes of NAACP chairman
Julian Bond, Southern Poverty Law Center counsel Morris Dees,
Jewish Defense League chairman Irv Rubin, New Black Panthers
founder Aaron Michaels, and Bob Blizter, chief of the FBI's
domestic terrorism bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Chughtai visited with Patrick Petrick, a former member of the
Aryan Brotherhood _ he has the white-power tattoos to prove it _
who has become a Christian and today calls prison in Huntsville,
Texas, home. She talked with the Rev. Claude E. Payne, bishop of
the Episcopal Diocese of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Powerfully and purposefully, ``Murder in Texas'' leads with the
murder of Byrd; we retrace the yellow-chalked road on which he was
dragged. Using footage from KPRC-TV, Houston's NBC affiliate, we
are introduced to his alleged killers, one of whom _ John William
``Bill'' King _ is facing trial next week.
</P>
<P>
   The report also begins with brief remarks from James Byrd's
sister, Clara Taylor, and daughter, Renee Mullins. Mullins recounts
how her father's body was so torn up _ his head and right arm were
dismembered _ that his casket had to be closed at the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Said Chughtai, ``She said to me _ this is not in the film _ `I
served in the U.S. military because I felt that the enemy was
outside my borders. But the enemy is within.'''
</P>
<P>
   The documentary then dives in deep, demarcating battle lines
separating sides of what NAACP's Bond calls a ``low-level race
war.'' Though small in number _ estimates are that the white
supremacist movement has 100,000 U.S. members, ``with a reach to
sympathizers of 1 million'' _ civil rights proponents treat their
rhetoric with deadly seriousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be black in America today is to be constantly on the alert
for real and sometimes imagined slights that come your way,'' says
Bond.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because they're seen less often, the appearances of
Pierce, Butler and Lee leave an indelible impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a patriotic person,'' says Pierce, ``but I feel no sense
of loyalty to government. I'm only concerned with my own people,
people of European ancestry.''
</P>
<P>
   Messages of hate come from both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to strangle them (his opponents) if I can,'' says
Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   The report, disturbingly illustrated with modern-day
cross-burnings and salutes to Hitler, also taps into the
supremacists' use of the Internet, and the Christian Identity
church movement, which says racial purity is Bible-based.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, it also recounts the Branch Davidian fiasco of
1994 in Waco, Texas, and the Oklahoma City bombing of 1995. ``The
Turner Diaries'' comes up here, with Dees linking the book to the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The book, the story of a race war in America targeting blacks,
Jews and the government, has been called by the FBI ``the bible of
the racist right.'' Timothy McVeigh, convicted in the Oklahoma City
bombing, is said to have had many copies of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised if the people who have engaged in strikes
against the government have in many cases read `The Turner
Diaries,''' says Pierce. ``In the case of the three ex-convicts in
Texas,'' he says, speaking of the men charged with Byrd's death,
``I may be surprised that any of them can even read. They seem
pretty much like a low-life crew ... I don't believe in many cases
(The Turner Diaries) inspires people to violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Chughtai said she was surprised she found the supremacists
``charmingly disarming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These men lead the movement because they inspire, and you can
see from the film that some people may think what they're saying is
frighteningly possible. It's because they're charmingly disarming
that they're dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   They were charming, but they could also be combative ``during
moments when they clearly didn't like the line of questioning that
I had to pursue,'' she said. ``I mean, this is not a propaganda
film, a platform for them to advertise their views.''
</P>
<P>
   The white supremacy movement, Chughtai warned, ``doesn't simply
target the lone African-American walking home late at night. They
are anti-Semitic, anti-abortion, anti-affirmative action, anti-race
mixing and anti-gay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The First and Second Amendments (of the Constitution) define
the dream of democratic freedom, but the consequence of that kind
of freedom is that you do have a constitutional right to hate,''
she said. ``You don't have a constitutional right to hurt somebody.
It's the gray area in between that I think we should address.''

DOCTORING SCORES TO HELP THE LOSERS

 (ATTN: Mass.)  (DUPLICATION NOTICE: Also moved in ``s'' category) 
(lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ This was taking the ``it's not who wins or loses''
thing a little too far.
</P>
<P>
   The city's high school hockey coaches have systematically _
though infrequently _ doctored the scores of games they call in to
the Boston newspapers when a horribly lopsided score would
embarrass the losers.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Globe reported Thursday that the athletic director
for Boston's schools, Rocco DiLorenzo, confessed to condoning the
compassionate inaccuracies after a Globe photographer who covered a
game noticed that the score reported by the school differed from
the one she had witnessed.
</P>
<P>
   DiLorenzo promised in writing to cease all trimming of the
margin of victory after The Globe threatened to stop printing
scores of high school games its reporters did not attend.
</P>
<P>
   DiLorenzo said there had been an informal pact among hockey
coaches since before he became athletic director in 1983 that they
should reduce lopsided winning scores at their discretion. He said
scores were fudged only once every two years or so, when a team's
self-esteem had been hurt in a game, and only in hockey, in which
the difference in goals can get especially glaring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to teach sportsmanship,'' he said. ``It's not
good for a team to get beat that way.''
</P>
<P>
   WBZ Radio reported that DiLorenzo had set a new policy: Once a
team led by 12 goals, a hockey game would be declared over.

   BOSTON _ This was taking the ``it's not who wins or loses''
thing a little too far.
</P>
<P>
   The city's high school hockey coaches have systematically _
though infrequently _ doctored the scores of games they call in to
the Boston newspapers when a horribly lopsided score would
embarrass the losers.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Globe reported Thursday that the athletic director
for Boston's schools, Rocco DiLorenzo, confessed to condoning the
compassionate inaccuracies after a Globe photographer who covered a
game noticed that the score reported by the school differed from
the one she had witnessed.
</P>
<P>
   DiLorenzo promised in writing to cease all trimming of the
margin of victory after The Globe threatened to stop printing
scores of high school games its reporters did not attend.
</P>
<P>
   DiLorenzo said there had been an informal pact among hockey
coaches since before he became athletic director in 1983 that they
should reduce lopsided winning scores at their discretion. He said
scores were fudged only once every two years or so, when a team's
self-esteem had been hurt in a game, and only in hockey, in which
the difference in goals can get especially glaring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to teach sportsmanship,'' he said. ``It's not
good for a team to get beat that way.''
</P>
<P>
   WBZ Radio reported that DiLorenzo had set a new policy: Once a
team led by 12 goals, a hockey game would be declared over.

 &HT;    Science, sound funding, consensus focus of Everglades
restoration
 &HT;    By Robert P. King
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Soon after walking into the hotel banquet room Thursday
night, Gov. Jeb Bush reminded more than 150 Everglades activists of
some of the reasons they might be wary of him:
</P>
<P>
   He's a Miami real estate developer. He's the son of a former
Texas oilman.
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, he's 100 percent committed to restoring and
protecting the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's possible to be Nixon to China, I'm going to find a way
to do it,'' Bush vowed, drawing repeated ovations from a crowd that
has also been applauding his choices of environmental advisers and
his decision to kill a controversial high-speed rail project.
</P>
<P>
   He said he'll try to end years of feuding among
environmentalists, farmers and developers to lead a restoration
based on science and sound finances.
</P>
<P>
   The speech followed what should have been a day of triumph for
the Everglades movement: In Orlando, Vice President Al Gore pledged
that the White House will ask Congress to spend $312 million next
year to restore South Florida's imperiled ecosystem _ a 35 percent
increase from this year's spending.
</P>
<P>
   And back in Miami, a phalanx of officials from the U.S. Interior
Department and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers promised that, despite
disagreements, they're united in crafting a $7.8 billion
restoration plan that will protect the Everglades and keep South
Florida livable for the next half-century.
</P>
<P>
   Yet harmony may prove elusive this weekend for environmentalists
holding the Everglades Coalition's 14th annual national conference.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the groups were divided on a crucial question about the
Corps' restoration plan: Is it so flawed that it needs a
top-to-bottom review by nationally reknowned scientists? Or can
they trust the Corps to respond to worries that the plan would do
more for the region's suburbs than for restoring the Everglades?
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club was leading the call for a scientific review,
saying it would ensure the best possible restoration. The National
and Florida Audubon societies said the review might create needless
delay _ with Charles Lee, a Florida Audubon senior vice president,
criticizing Sierra's stance as a ``fringe position.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, another group of ``unaffiliated'' environmentalists,
most of them consultants for the Miccosukee Indian tribe, issued a
statement Thursday accusing the Interior Department of encouraging
attacks on the Corps' plan.
</P>
<P>
   Those activists, including tribal attorney Dexter Lehtinen and
retired Corps commander Terry Rice, said recent criticism of the
plan by scientists at Everglades National Park is part of a pattern
of ``self-destructive behavior'' that threatens to doom the
restoration.
</P>
<P>
   Some activists said friction is nothing new for the coalition,
an alliance of 42 local, state, national and international groups,
or for the environmental movement as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's typical,'' said Ron Tipton of the World Wildlife Fund.
``You're not going to have complete consensus on that many
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, leaders of the Interior Department and the Corps
insisted that the park's recent criticisms of the plan's first
draft don't mean a war has broken out. They praised the progress
the Corps and other agencies have made in meeting tight deadlines
set by Congress, which wants the plan July 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will tell you that there is not a feud,'' said Deputy
Assistant Secretary of the Army Mike Davis. ``If someone wants to
try to make it a controversy, I guess they can. ... It's a
nonstory.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it a feud?'' park Superintendent Richard Ring said. ``I
don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Government and coalition leaders joined in praising the White
House's proposed $312 million Everglades budget, much of which
would go toward buying land inside and east of the Everglades. The
money would include $151 million for the Interior Department and
$128 million for the Corps.
</P>
<P>
   The land money is part of a recent White House proposal to
devote more than $900 million to buying and preserving land
nationwide, said Patricia Beneke, Interior's assistant secretary
for water and science.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration proposals don't always become reality, of
course _ three years ago, Gore announced a penny-per-pound federal
fee on Florida sugar that Congress later refused to enact. But
Everglades Coalition Co-Chairwoman Mary Munson said she's
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident we can do it as long as we keep national
attention on it,'' Munson said, echoing a theme of this year's
conference. ``People outside of Florida need to understand that
this is important.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Bush pledged to build agreement among developers,
farmers and state lawmakers that saving the Everglades is crucial
to Florida's economic future. He promised to build common ground,
to move ``away from litigation to doing stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot more consensus than we've been told,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said protecting the Everglades must include rebuilding
South Florida's hollowed-out inner cities _ which, he said, by
their failure, fuel westward sprawl while creating ``economic
apartheid.''
</P>
<P>
   Before speaking, Bush held private meetings with Everglades
Coalition leaders and activists from the Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   At the conference, Bush arrived with his troika of environmental
advisers: David Struhs, the new secretary of the state Department
of Environmental Protection, who is leaving a similar position in
Massachusetts; Community Affairs Secretary Steve Seibert, a former
Pinellas County commissioner; and Allison DeFoor, an ex-judge from
the Keys named to the new post of state Everglades czar.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also received a Florida Audubon Society award for
environmental leadership and a ``Save the Everglades'' T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's tremendous vision, a tremendous sense of how to do
it,'' exulted Florida Audubon's Lee, a Democrat. ``The Bush
administration has launched the most optimistic, forward-look
environmental preview of anyone in the governor's office in
memory.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barbara Lange, a Sierra Club activist from Miami, wasn't
ready to sing any hosannas to Bush yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's highly personable,'' Lange said. ``I'm going to
wait and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Lange also disputed Bush's call for consensus, telling him: ``I
think more has been accomplished through lawsuits.'' She later
cited a 1988 federal lawsuit that led to the ongoing Everglades
cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was unswayed. ``I'm not a big lawsuit man,'' he told her.

SPAIN SALE REPORTED FOR BOEING, BUT SAS MAY BOLT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Spanish airline Spanair is reported to be near an
agreement to buy 15 jetliners from The Boeing Co. and place options
for 30 more, but that good piece of news for the world's largest
aerospace company could be tempered by word that Scandinavian
Airlines System, a loyal Boeing customer for many years, may be
about to turn to Airbus for a new fleet of widebody planes.
</P>
<P>
   SAS, Europe's sixth-largest airline, said it is considering
buying as many as 15 Airbus A330 and A340 jetliners. Those models
compete with Boeing's 777. The order could be worth about $2.4
billion at aircraft list prices.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing and Airbus have been making a hard pitch for months to
sell SAS on their respective planes.
</P>
<P>
   If the airline buys from Airbus, it would be another in a series
of airline defections from Boeing, which in the past year has seen
longtime customers such as British Airways buy planes from Airbus
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure Boeing is preaching profits rather than market share
... but Boeing doesn't want to lose any (customers) and they have
lost more than their fair share lately,'' said Paul Nisbet,
aerospace analyst with JSA Research.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing executives have said repeatedly in the past year, as the
company has struggled financially, that they intend to sell planes
at a profit even if it means losing market share to Airbus. Last
year, Airbus took about 45 percent of new airplane orders. The
European consortium has been steadily closing the gap with Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Ulf Thorne, an SAS spokesman in Stockholm, was quoted by
Bloomberg news service as saying the airline was ``prioritizing
discussions with Airbus.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said no final decision has been made. That view was
echoed by the two airplane makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would love to see them as a repeat customer,'' said Airbus
spokeswoman Mary Anne Greczyn.
</P>
<P>
   The airline now operates four Airbus A300s, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Battishill, Boeing's spokesman for Europe, said talks are
continuing between the company and SAS.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaign is not over,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is Boeing's policy not to comment on possible orders until
they are announced by the customer.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Battishill would not confirm a published report
by the Spanish newspaper Cinco Dias on Thursday that Spanair is
about to place a big order with Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are negotiating. I can't talk about the details,''
Battishill said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the planes will be 737s and 757s, though Spanair will
also buy some 767s, the Spanish paper said. A Spanair spokeswoman
would neither confirm nor deny the report.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanair order could be announced soon. The SAS decision is
expected within a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Even if SAS decides to buy from Airbus to rebuild its fleet of
aging widebody jets, the airline will likely stick with Boeing as
its supplier of narrowbody jets, according to industry analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Last July, SAS ordered 13 Boeing next-generation 737-600 jets
worth about $400 million to expand its fleet for European travel,
along with options to buy another 40.
</P>
<P>
   SAS bought its first Boeing plane, a 747 jumbo jet, in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Nisbet said he would be ``very surprised'' if SAS bought
narrowbody planes from Airbus.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they decided to choose Airbus for all planes, including
narrowbody jets, that would be very significant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are just rebuilding their widebody fleet, that would
be much less earthshaking.''

A RITZ-CARLTON LUXURY HOTEL MAY RISE AT MANHATTAN'S TIP 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID W. DUNLAP    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The tip of Manhattan would get a new Ritz-Carlton
Hotel under a development plan that the Battery Park City Authority
is expected to approve Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The luxury hotel would occupy the lower 13 floors of a 38-story
tower to be built by Millennium Partners on the most prominent
undeveloped site remaining at Battery Park City, commanding
unimpeded views of Battery Park, Pier A, Ellis Island, the Statue
of Liberty, the Hudson River and New York Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   At the base of the tower would be a permanent rent-free home for
the itinerant Skyscraper Museum, which has to scout out temporary
quarters for each of its shows. It is now housed in the former
banking hall of 16 Wall St. ``We can get in the guidebooks _
finally,'' said Carol Willis, the founder, director and curator of
the museum. ``We'll have a real address we can print more than six
months before we open a show. We'll literally get on the map.''
</P>
<P>
   The Skyscraper Museum was founded by Ms. Willis in 1996 as a
private nonprofit institution devoted to the study of high-rise
buildings. Its first show, held in 1997 was ``Downtown New York.''
Its current show, ``Building the Empire State,'' runs through
March. Its Web site is www.skyscraper.org.
</P>
<P>
   The authority had required bidders for the site to provide a
public amenity. Millennium proposed to install the museum in 5,000
square feet on the ground floor of its tower, a block from the
Museum of Jewish Heritage-A Living Memorial to the Holocaust. A
founder of Millennium, Philip E. Aarons, is also on the board of
the Skyscraper Museum.
</P>
<P>
   On the upper floors of the $175 million, glass-and-brick tower
would be 150 condominium units and 65 furnished apartments. Between
the apartments and the hotel, on the 14th floor, would be a
restaurant and a broad outdoor terrace, overlooking the water and
open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel, with 250 to 300 rooms, would be New York's third
Ritz-Carlton in 90 years. It would be only seven blocks from the
New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``Views alone would not be sufficient to construct a five-star
hotel,'' said Christopher M. Jeffries, president of Millennium
Partners. ``But with the combination of views and Wall Street and
customers who currently come back to midtown, we think there's a
sufficiently deep market of people who would find it as convenient
or more convenient to stay immediately adjacent to where they're
working.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ritz-Carlton name,'' he said, ``is a very strong
international brand, and one we think will bring people down to a
location they might not otherwise have thought of.''
</P>
<P>
   If the tower proposal is approved, it would mark the end of a
decade of failed efforts to find a hotel developer for the south
end of Battery Park City. Earlier attempts were frustrated by the
collapse of the New York real-estate market in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, the parcel known as Site 1 would be leased
for 70 years to Millennium, a national developer best known in New
York for having re-created the area around Lincoln Center with
three huge residential and retail projects. (Millennium is not
related to the Millenium Hilton Hotel near the World Trade Center.)
</P>
<P>
   The other bidder for Site 1 was Forest City Ratner Companies,
which is now building an Embassy Suites Hotel at Battery Park City,
north of the World Financial Center.

YOUNG FINDS THAT PATIENCE PAYS OFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Usually, it's the freshmen who need patience. But
in Ray Young's case, it was the coach.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA coach Steve Lavin criticized his own substitution pattern
Tuesday when discussing Young's playing time _ or lack thereof.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to play Young a sustained amount of time,'' Lavin
said. ``It's tough, when you're in and out, to get your rhythm. I
probably need to be more patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as his players played with patience against USC on
Wednesday, Lavin backed off his frenetic substitution pattern long
enough to let Young, a reserve guard, find his groove. The result:
12 points and four rebounds in 14 minutes. He was 5 of 5 from the
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time always helps,'' said Young whose playing time included
two stretches of five minutes. ``If I'm able to get sustained
playing time, then I try to get something positive out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Young helped UCLA take command early in the second half with his
best sequence of the season _ nine points and an assist in five
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   He entered the game with 18:39 remaining and quickly found Baron
Davis for a layup. A minute later, Young teamed with Earl Watson
for a give-and-go layup. After a USC turnover, Young grabbed
another Watson pass and dunked. Another USC turnover became another
Young dunk. He finished the surge with a 3-pointer from the right
baseline.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA had turned a 48-35 lead into a 59-37 cushion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm learning how much of this is mental, how important your
mental preparation is for each game,'' Young said. ``I've elongated
my concentration. I'm visualizing what I've got to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he sees more playing time.
</P>
<P>
   What it means: The Bruins' victory over USC was one of their
most important to date. Every win this month _ especially on the
road _ increases their margin for error in the second half of
league play, when they must make the brutal Bay Area and Arizona
road trips.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins are 13-4 overall and 5-2 in the Pacific-10. If they
simply win their remaining home games _ the Oregon and Washington
schools, USC and Syracuse _ they'll finish 19-11 and 10-8. That
should get them into the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Injury update: Freshman center Dan Gadzuric has been downgraded
to doubtful for Saturday's game at Louisville because of a sprained
right ankle suffered at USC.
</P>
<P>
   And finally: The Bruins will not tour Europe next summer, which
enables them to play in an exempted tournament. They're expected to
participate in the Pearl Harbor Classic from Dec. 21-23 in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents in 1999-2000 include North Carolina, Syracuse, Purdue,
Pepperdine, DePaul and Gonzaga _ but no Rhode Island.

LOSS OF CLAMMING BOAT AND 4 LIVES SPURS 2 FEDERAL PROBES
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HACKENSACK, N.J. _ The sinking of a clamming boat and the loss
of her four crew members off New Jersey on Monday have prompted two
federal investigations that will seek clues to the accident and
examine safety in the commercial fishing industry and
communications between the Coast Guard and floundering vessels.
</P>
<P>
   In one investigation, the National Transportation Safety Board
said it would try to learn why the Adriatic, the boat that sank,
went down in rough seas after clamming for about 24 hours. That
investigation will examine, in particular, how the Coast Guard
received and responded to a brief, garbled Mayday message sent from
the crippled vessel in her final minutes. Safety board officials
said they were studying possible ways to improve the Coast Guard's
communications systems and were not criticizing the response to
Monday's sinking or the responses after two other vessels sank off
the East Coast in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   In the second inquiry, the Coast Guard said Thursday it would
create a task force to look into of the loss of the Adriatic and
three other commercial fishing vessels off the East Coast since
late December that have resulted in the deaths or disappearances of
11 crew members. In a statement, the Coast Guard said it wanted to
learn if the mishaps had a common cause and to find ways to improve
the safety of the nation's commercial fishing fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's death rate of 178 per 100,000 fishermen is higher
than any other occupation in the nation, and shell-fishing is the
riskiest element in it, according to 1996 figures from the federal
Bureau of Labor Statistics. Clammers who regularly work New
Jersey's fertile clam beds have long been aware of the dangers,
especially for vessels carrying tons of clams on stormy winter
seas. But the recent flurry of fatal accidents has stunned even
hardened fishing veterans on the Jersey shore.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard issued word of its task force _ which is to
include federal officials and representatives of the fishing
industry _ late Thursday morning, about the same time it ended its
search for the Adriatic's missing crew members. For about 64 hours
since Monday night, the Coast Guard said, its planes, boats and
helicopters had crisscrossed a section of the Atlantic about the
size of Massachusetts without finding any sign of the men.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've exhausted just about everything,'' said Lt. Commander
John Fitzgerald, a Coast Guard spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald said the Coast Guard was cooperating with the safety
board. ``We're both working together to find out what happened,''
he said. ``We're partners in this.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The safety board's inquiry into the sinking of the Adriatic is
part of a broader, ongoing investigation into the Coast Guard's
ability to receive distress signals from floundering vessels and
its ability to respond to them, said Ted Lopatkiewicz, a board
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Jack O'Dell, a spokesman in the Coast Guard's headquarters in
Washington, said the Coast Guard could not respond immediately to
the distress call from the Adriatic because its Mayday signal was
garbled and did not mention location. He said the Coast Guard
welcomed the safety board's inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard officials have said the search for the Adriatic
started about five hours after her ``Mayday'' call, and then only
after a clam dock in Atlantic City called the Coast Guard to report
the Adriatic was an hour overdue.
</P>
<P>
   The Adriatic's message about 3 p.m. lasted only two or three
seconds, and the Coast Guard's radio operators could not understand
the ship's name in the call, Fitzgerald said. Immediately, he said,
the operators began broadcasting appeals for a repeat of the
message and continued doing so for an hour. There was no response,
he said. Then operators asked ships off the New Jersey coast if
they had heard the distress call. None responded, he said.

COMING TO OUR NECK OF WOODS  
 TIGER TO SAY HE'LL JOIN PHOENIX OPEN FIELD

<P>
   Can he do it again? Can Tiger Woods give Phoenix Open fans
another magical moment like the one he pulled out of his hat during
the 1997 tournament?
</P>
<P>
   According to Woods' agent, Mark Steinberg of IMG, his office
will make the call today to PGA Tour headquarters in Ponte Vedra,
Fla., committing Woods to Phoenix's 132-man field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger will be there,'' Steinberg told ``The Arizona Republic''
on Thursday. ``The only reason he did not commit prior to this was
we just didn't want things to get out of hand before he got
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg said the superstar and his father, Earl, will arrive
in Phoenix on Saturday, when he will attend a special dinner party
being held by the Tiger Woods Foundation at Planet Hollywood. On
Sunday, Woods will give a clinic to 25 youths at Glen Lakes Golf
Club in Glendale, then meet and talk to 2,500 children later in the
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he's really looking forward to playing in Phoenix
again,'' said Steinberg, who was in Los Angeles meeting with Tiger
over business matters.
</P>
<P>
   Tournament Chairman Ray Artigue of the sponsoring Phoenix
Thunderbirds said he had expected Woods to play, but confirmation
of Woods' commitment ``will help me sleep a little better.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting Tiger just makes a great tournament greater,'' Artigue
said. ``We might have to roll out the presses one more time and
print up some more daily tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods' presence could be worth another 50,000 to 100,000 fans,
not that the tour's most popular tournament needs more fans. Last
year, a record 467,000 showed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure all of Arizona will be rooting for Tiger to make
another ace at the 16th,'' Artigue said.
</P>
<P>
   Woods almost stole the show from champion Steve Jones in the '97
Phoenix Open when he holed out at the infamous 16th hole, sending
about 10,000 fans into a beer cup-throwing frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger's ``shot heard 'round the world,'' which has been shown
hundreds of times on TV, is perhaps the best-known highlight in the
tournament's history, which dates to 1935.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg said the well-documented hole in one also is one of
Woods' favorite memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got a lot of good vibes from that,'' the agent said.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg said he wasn't sure how many of the pre-tournament
festivities Woods will attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll definitely play in the Wednesday pro-am,'' Steinberg
said. ``And the only other thing he might play in would be the
skins game (on Tuesday). Normally, he doesn't play in those things,
but that might be an exception because everybody has been so nice
to him out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg said only more business meetings might get in the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really do have some major things that must get discussed,''
he said. ``But if we get done with them in time, I wouldn't be
surprised if he played (in the skins game).''
</P>
<P>
   Woods' entry means at least 93 of the top 125 money-winners from
last season are entered in the tournament. Several other notables,
such as Tom Watson, Ben Crenshaw, Jeff Maggert and last week's
Hawaiian Open winner, Jeff Sluman, still have until 3 p.m. today to
commit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of who else might come, this stacks up as one of
our best tournaments ever,'' Artigue said.
</P>
<P>
   Woods joins David Duval, Phil Mickelson and John Daly as the
crowd favorites, although the tournament is fairly loaded with
big-name players. Two marquee names who will miss the Open are Greg
Norman, who still is recovering from shoulder surgery, and Fred
Couples, who does not play in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Others of major interest who have committed include Stuart
Appleby, Paul Azinger, Mark Calcavecchia, Scott Hoch, Lee Janzen,
Steve Jones, Andrew Magee, Billy Mayfair, Frank Nobilo, Vijay
Singh, Payne Stewart, Bob Tway, Fuzzy Zoeller and defending
champion Jesper Parnevik. &QL;

GIULIANI NAMES PANEL FOR GOVERNORS ISLAND 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES DAO    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Acknowledging that his idea for a casino resort on
Governors Island was unrealistic, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has
appointed a task force that includes several of his critics to help
plan the redevelopment of the former Coast Guard base off
Manhattan's southern tip.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor had advocated construction of a casino resort on the
173-acre island in New York Harbor, an idea that drew fire from
members of Congress and civic and environmental groups who want the
island put to more public use, like parkland, artist housing or a
college campus.
</P>
<P>
   Now the mayor has backed away from the casino proposal. With his
appointment of a bipartisan advisory task force _ an idea his aides
criticized a year ago _ he appears to be signaling a willingness to
reach accommodation with his critics on the future of Governors
Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to establish a consensus,'' Deputy Mayor Randy L.
Levine said in an interview Thursday. ``There have been a lot of
people who have complained and carped. Now is the time to step up
to the plate, get work done and try and put something together for
New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Levine said the mayor still considered a casino a good idea, but
unrealistic, since it would require changing the state
Constitution, a long and difficult process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to go on the prospect that a casino today is not a
viable option,'' Levine said.
</P>
<P>
   The city's goal for the task force, he said, would be to develop
a plan that includes public parkland, provides for the maintenance
of the island's historic buildings and generates revenue that pays
for public services like ferry service. Levine said that he would
serve as chairman, and that he hoped to convene the first meeting
early next month.
</P>
<P>
   The group will include three people who had been critical of the
casino idea: Reps. Jerrold L. Nadler and Carolyn B. Maloney, both
New York Democrats, and Tony Bullock, chief of staff for Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We've had our differences in the past,'' Ms. Maloney said.
``But I'm taking his action in good faith. I believe he really
believes we should work together for the good of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel will also include representatives of Sheldon Silver,
the Assembly speaker; Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader;
Gov. George E. Pataki, and several civic groups, including the
Municipal Arts Society, Levine said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton told Sen. Moynihan three years ago that he
would be willing to help give the island to New York City provided
there was an acceptable plan for maintaining and using it.
Proposals submitted to the city have included a Greenwich
Village-like residential and commercial community, an amusement
park and film studios. Columbia University and New York University
have submitted plans for faculty and student housing.
</P>
<P>
   But many officials contend that the city could lose its chance
to control development of the island if it does not develop a plan
before Clinton leaves office at the end of next year. There also
has been talk in Congress of selling the island to the highest
bidder if the city cannot come up with an acceptable plan.

TRAIN TO PLANE IS SEEN MAINLY AS A PAIN  (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If for some reason you were hungry for outrage and
skepticism, you could have done no better than to show up on
Wednesday night at the Robert Ross Johnson Family Life Center, in
the St. Albans neighborhood of Queens. The map said this was
Queens. But those were unmistakably Bronx cheers coming from 400
people who packed a community board meeting to vent their anger at
a planned rail link to Kennedy International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to ask one question,'' a man said in a booming voice.
``Who asked for this damn thing?''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, quite a few New Yorkers have. Rail lines to both
Kennedy and LaGuardia Airports have been deemed essential by
transportation specialists for decades. The real question is not
who asked for this thing, but rather if the city's needs will be
met by this particular $1.5 billion project of the Port Authority
of New York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, New York is catching up to other major cities, which
have long recognized that the way to beat the strangling effects of
the automobile is with a downtown-to-airport rail connection. A
spectacular example is a new train that whisks travelers from
Heathrow Airport to Paddington Station in central London in 15
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airport economy is critical to your interests and needs,''
Cruz Russell, the authority's director of policy and planning, told
the audience in St. Albans.
</P>
<P>
   But the crowd, mostly from nearby Jamaica, wasn't impressed.
Anyone speaking up for the project was hooted down with shouts of
``You don't live in our community.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that Jamaica residents will feel pain from
a project that largely benefits travelers to and from Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The plan has three components: a loop connecting Kennedy's
terminals, a link from the airport to the Howard Beach stop on the
A train, and a hookup from Kennedy to a station in Jamaica where
travelers can switch to the Long Island Rail Road or to the E, J
and Z subway trains. That last section is the one in dispute
because it involves an elevated train slicing through Jamaica,
above the median of the Van Wyck Expressway.
</P>
<P>
   Local residents protested that they can expect years of air
pollution and clogged streets once construction begins. They were
unmoved when Russell promised that the authority would try ``to
disincent'' trucks from using local roads. They talked about the
unsightliness of a 50-foot-high elevated line, and pointed out that
few of them will ever use it because it will make no local stops.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   How you build a corridor to a Queens airport without affecting
one Queens neighborhood or another was left a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Heathrow Express, it will not provide a seamless
``one-seat'' ride. Travelers willing to lug suitcases from
Manhattan on the E train must then switch at Jamaica. To critics,
it sounds like a souped-up version of the ``Train to the Plane,''
which died in 1990 because, as some noted on Wednesday, few
tourists were prepared to ``schlep their bags'' across two trains.
</P>
<P>
   The Port Authority says there are ways around the problem,
including a possible baggage check-in at Jamaica. Still, it expects
only 7,000 people a day to use the Airtrain, possibly as many as
half of them airport workers, not travelers.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the project is lumbering through New York's complex
land-use process. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has given his qualified
approval, but the City Council must also climb aboard.
</P>
<P>
   So there is still a way to go, with not much guaranteed except
perhaps that most Jamaica residents will continue to agree with a
woman who stood up in St. Albans and said, ``I'm tired of all of
you ignoring us when we say N-O.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   VERONA, N.Y. _ Five years ago, people in this quiet, rural
community gazed with envy and amazement at the instant success of
the Oneida Indian Nation's new Turning Stone Casino, an economic
juggernaut that created thousands of jobs and lured millions of
visitors to this desolate area halfway between Syracuse and Utica.
</P>
<P>
   A few grumbled that it was unfair that the Oneidas did not have
to pay taxes on their new wealth. A few others complained that the
casino was crowding out small businesses. Yet on balance, most
tolerated the incongruously mammoth Oz-like resort here, perhaps
rationalizing that the Oneida Indians deserved a leg up after
suffering years of poverty and discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before it got personal.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Oneidas and the Justice Department announced
that they wanted to include 20,000 landowners as defendants in a
long-stewing lawsuit to reclaim 270,000 acres from New York state.
And almost immediately, the peaceful coexistence was shattered, as
landowners flocked to meetings, hinted at violence and snubbed
Oneida businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll never catch me buying their gas or going to their
casino again,'' said Rosemary Canaguier, 60, who was combing the
golden curls of a longtime customer, Bette Button, at the hair
salon Ms. Canaguier runs in her house in Canastota. ``There's a
terrible, terrible dislike now. I don't think you'll ever see the
people here ever trusting them again.''
</P>
<P>
   There is more, however, to this slide from empathy to enmity
than just the fear of losing land that is roughly equivalent to the
areas of New York City, Washington and Boston combined.
</P>
<P>
   For many, the land-claim dispute has brought to the surface a
latent sense of frustration and jealousy over the phenomenal
success of the Oneida Indian Nation, which, like all federally
recognized Indian tribes, does not pay taxes. Just like that, it
seems, the Oneidas have rocketed from poverty to affluence, from
being the have-nots to the haves, while everyone else in a
working-class area stocked with grind-it-out dairy farmers has seen
income stagnate.
</P>
<P>
   So for many non-Oneidas, watching the Oneidas ask for the most
prized of possessions around here _ land _ is tantamount to
watching the rich squeeze the not-so-rich. And the federal
government's decision to side with the Oneidas, many people say,
only compounds their outrage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It smacks of nothing more than greed, and people feel betrayed
because we've given them every advantage that every private
businessman would die for,'' said David Wood, an Oneida County
legislator. ``Not only do we feel threatened, we're offended that
our neighbors would do this.''
</P>
<P>
   That cocktail of anger and vulnerability figures to intensify in
the coming months, residents say. On March 29, Judge Neal McCurn of
U.S. District Court in Syracuse is expected to hear arguments on
whether to include the landowners in the federal lawsuit. McCurn is
also expected to decide soon whether to appoint an arbitrator to do
what the Oneidas and New York state officials have failed to do for
more than 13 years: hammer out a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, the Oneidas filed a lawsuit in federal court saying
that New York state and local governments had illegally acquired
Oneida lands in the 1700s and 1800s through illegal and coercive
treaties. Fifteen years later, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the
Oneidas' argument.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the state began to negotiate with the Oneidas.
But for years, nothing happened _ nothing, that is, until December,
when the Oneidas and the Justice Department, seeking to pressure
the state into a settlement, moved to name the 20,000 landowners as
defendants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to use a tool of discomfort, and that we regret,''
said Ray Halbritter, nation representative and chief executive of
the Oneida Indian Nation.
</P>
<P>
   Halbritter said that the Oneidas did not want to evict anyone.
Instead, he said that he would push for a creative solution that
would benefit all parties.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has echoed that position. So has the
state. In a statement last month, Gov. George Pataki said, ``We are
going to make sure no one loses their homes, no one loses their
property.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, such assurances have only bred more cynicism and
mistrust in the land-claim area of northern Madison and western
Oneida counties.
</P>
<P>
   At a forum in Verona, Michael Gaiser, owner of a
bed-and-breakfast in Vernon whose business has been severely
clipped by the Oneidas' casino hotel, captured the bunkerlike
mentality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Justice Department is the one standing there telling us
they're going to sue us, and you're telling us that we're not going
to be giving up our land,'' said an exasperated Gaiser, his voice
billowing with a timbre reminiscent of Jimmy Stewart. ``Well, I
don't know if I believe you!''
</P>
<P>
   Gaiser was one of 350 people to attend the meeting, organized by
Ralph Eannace Jr., the Oneida County executive. Many belonged to a
landowners' group, Upstate Citizens for Equality, which was founded
two years ago to challenge the Oneidas' tax-free status but has
swelled in recent weeks to 1,000 members because of the land-claim
dispute, said its president, Scott Peterman.
</P>
<P>
   Eannace had invited the public to quiz a panel of state and
county lawyers involved in the negotiations. But the mood was often
testy, as speaker after speaker dismissed the relevance of
something that happened 200 years ago, accused local politicians of
being beholden to Oneida campaign contributions, and blamed the
Oneidas _ now the area's largest employer, with 3,000 jobs _ for
the souring fortunes of dozens of local businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Thomas, 51, of Vernon, stoked the passions midway through
the three-hour meeting when he told organizers that they had
forgotten to recite the Pledge of Allegiance. So everyone stood up,
pledged, then applauded vigorously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Constitution protects us from segregation and
discrimination, so that no one person or group can hold sway over
any other person in this nation,'' said Thomas. ``And I say to you,
that is exactly what is happening here with the issue of taxation
with the Indians.''
</P>
<P>
   To the Oneidas, though, these complaints about unfair
competition and basic rights betray a lack of perspective. For many
years, the Oneidas were relegated to a 32-acre parcel dotted by
abandoned trailers donated by the federal government. At one point,
only a few Oneidas lived on the reservation.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, the Oneida Indian Nation, flush with casino
cash, has purchased 7,000 acres in the area, opened five gas
stations and financed cultural and housing projects for a local
Oneida population of 500 that continues to grow, Halbritter said.
The Oneidas do not disclose how much Turning Stone earns, but
industry analysts say that the casino, one of the country's most
lucrative, generates annual revenues of hundreds of millions of
dollars.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That money has helped the area economy as well as the Oneidas,
Halbritter said. Since 1996, the Oneidas have contributed about
$812,000 to school districts and municipalities. And Zogby
International, a Utica-based research firm, recently concluded that
the Oneidas' economic muscle had, among other benefits, helped
convince Wall Street to upgrade Oneida County's municipal bond
rating, saving taxpayers $3.2 million in borrowing costs.
</P>
<P>
   But that has done little to assuage the populist anger, which
Halbritter said emerged only after the Oneidas became wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should we take every ethnic group and allocate a certain
amount of success so that the blacks don't get too rich, or the
Italians, or the Irish, or the Asians?'' said Halbritter, who grew
up poor in central New York and worked his way through Harvard Law
School. ``It's the kind of racism that they don't even know is
racism.''
</P>
<P>
   But Peterman of the Upstate Citizens for Equality said the group
would do whatever was necessary to defend the landowners' rights.
The land-claim dispute, he said, is the last straw with the
Oneidas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a lot of working stiffs that are subsidizing the
rich, and the galling thing is that the Indians are rubbing it in
our faces,'' said Peterman, a personable, earnest engineer who
before the escalation of the lawsuit had never been active in civic
affairs. ``If they push this through, I think you're going to see
people kill each other.''

UPBEAT CALIPARI OPENS WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ John Calipari does it at the beginning
of each season. He looks his players in the eyes, speaks in his
boldest, most confident tone and launches into a soliloquy about
winning. And no matter how poor his club is and how far-fetched the
idea of success may be, the Nets coach always ends with this
prediction: ``We're going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Calipari's words drew laughter. Last season, they
made his players think. On Thursday, the Nets agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first year since I've been the coach here that I
could feel they expect to win,'' Calipari said, after meeting with
his team for the first time in eight months. ``They got me excited.
They're ready. They know what's at stake. They know we have a
chance in this shortened season. There's a window of opportunity
for us and now it's `Are we going to take advantage of that?'''
</P>
<P>
   The team that took the floor at the Nets' Champion Center on
Thursday plans to do that. With nine players returning from last
season, two solid newcomers, and Michael Jordan out of the mix, the
Nets believe they can win. They will not predict an Eastern
Conference title, or even an Atlantic Division title, but they feel
that both crowns are within reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready for the challenge,'' point guard Sam Cassell said.
``We're someone that you have to contend with in the Eastern
Conference. I hear a lot of talk about Miami and Indiana. They're
two magnificent ball clubs, but you can't count us out.''
</P>
<P>
   Cassell, who stayed in Houston and Washington during the
lockout, was one of three Nets starters who entered the club's
practice facility for the first time this season after shunning the
voluntary workouts over the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Kittles and Kendall Gill were the others, but after
running an intense two-and-a-half-hour practice, Calipari had no
complaints about their conditioning. In fact, he praised Gill, who
showed up with bulging muscles in his arms and blond highlights in
his hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kendall is in unbelievable shape,'' Calipari said. ``He could
play 50 games back to back to back right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Gill, the 6-foot-5-inch small forward who has been the subject
of numerous trade rumors, said he is in the greatest shape of his
life. He spent the off-season running and lifting weights in
Chicago and plans to have the type of season that will keep his
name out of the trade rumor mill.
</P>
<P>
   He said that hearing his name with Rony Seikaly's in a
sign-and-trade deal for Minnesota's Tom Gugliotta, fired him up.
``Once I get on the court, all of those questions will be
answered,'' Gill said, explaining why he worked so hard during the
lockout. ``I wasn't satisfied with my individual season last year.
I want to get back to the talent level that you guys saw a couple
of years ago. That's not saying that I'm looking to lead this team
in scoring again or anything like that. But I have to be the best
player I can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Calipari ran the Nets through drills with a starting five of
Cassell and Kittles at the guards, Gill and Keith Van Horn as the
forwards and Jayson Williams at center. With Chris Gatling, Rony
Seikaly, McIlvaine and Murdock serving as able reserves, the Nets
hope to run down opponents with their depth.
</P>
<P>
   McIlvaine and Murdock should improve the Nets defense. McIlvaine
is a 7-1 shot blocker who was recently acquired from Seattle for
Don MacLean and Michael Cage, and Murdock is a point guard with
excellent defensive instincts. McIlvaine watched from the sideline
as the Nets and SuperSonics waited for the trade to be approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to be better defensively,'' said Calipari, whose
club allowed 98 points a game in going 43-39 last season. ``If we
truly want to improve over a slightly .500 season and getting in
the playoffs on the last game of the season, it all will come down
to defense.''

   Gill said the Nets, who are viewed as one of the league's up and
coming teams, need to do more than defend to reach their potential.
``The main thing we have to do is not trip on our press clippings
because everybody's touting us to be a great team and be in the
championship in two years,'' Gill said. ``We only made the playoffs
by one game last year, so we can't get beside ourselves. That's one
of the things that we have to communicate with each other _ that
we're not the great team that everybody's saying we are yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying we won't be there. Eventually, I think we will
be if we keep everybody together, but not yet.''
</P>
<P>
   But at least they believe.

WAITING IN THE WINGS FOR A SENATORIAL RUN 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By   ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ Of all the people buzzing about whether
Hillary Rodham Clinton will run for Senate from New York, there
aren't many more interested than Rep. Nita M. Lowey of Westchester
_ the Democratic ``backup,'' as her friend Rep. Charles B. Rangel
of Manhattan likes to call her.
</P>
<P>
   If Mrs. Clinton doesn't run, Mrs. Lowey said this week, she
herself may. If Mrs. Clinton does, Mrs. Lowey won't. As it happens,
the backup got to assess the situation up close on Tuesday after
the president's State of the Union address, when she and Rangel
went together to a White House reception and talked to the first
lady, who is Rangel's _ and Democratic New York's _ Choice No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Well?
</P>
<P>
   ``She hasn't focused on it,'' Mrs. Lowey reported over an
egg-white-and-mushroom omelette at the diner across the street from
her White Plains office. ``There's so much else on her mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lowey said she told Mrs. Clinton at the White House that
she was ``actively exploring the race,'' but that if Mrs. Clinton
decided to run, ``I'll be happy and privileged to support you.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's reaction, Mrs. Lowey said, was noncommittal:
``She just hugged me, and was very warm.''
</P>
<P>
   But she didn't squelch the talk, either. As Rangel, the main
promoter of a first lady candidacy, put it: ``I know when I'm being
rebuffed. And Hillary Clinton has not said or done anything that
would allow me to believe that it's impossible for her to become a
candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which leaves Mrs. Lowey in a not-unpleasant limbo, as a
well-liked moderately liberal Democrat, barely known statewide, who
is enjoying the attention. Last night Mrs. Lowey was in Albany to
talk to Democratic leaders at a belated victory celebration for the
party's November candidates; on Wednesday she met in Washington
with Ellen R. Malcolm, the president of Emily's List, the national
organization that supports female Democratic candidates who favor
abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Over her omelette, Mrs. Lowey behaved herself, although when
pressed about a possible Republican opponent, Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani, she did say that ``the voters are going to have to
determine whether the skills of Rudy Guiliani are transferable to
the Senate. In the Senate, working in a bipartisan, collegial way
is the key to success.''
</P>
<P>
   If Giuliani's supporters view Mrs. Lowey as a second-tier
candidate whom the mayor would eat for breakfast, Mrs. Lowey's
supporters savor the idea of running commercials against the
tantrum-prone Giuliani featuring him as a classroom bully with a
big ``F'' on his chest _ his grade for social skills. ``To be
successful in the Senate,'' Mrs. Lowey reiterated, ``you have to
work well and play well with others.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lowey, 61, likes to present herself as a nice mother and
grandmother, which seems true enough, although she is a
well-financed one who lives in upper-class Harrison and gave up
cooking for Congress. Her husband, Steve Lowey, is a lawyer who
represents investors in class-action suits against major
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lowey, who said she would make up her mind about running in
April, said that she hasn't decided how much of her own money she
might spend in the race, but that she and her husband ``are not in
the position'' to wholly finance what she expects to be a $15
million to $20 million campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lowey has spent almost all of her life in the 18th
congressional district, designed for her, which wanders from
Cheever-esque Westchester suburbs into a working-class bit of the
Bronx and scattered parts of Queens. Mrs. Lowey, the daughter of a
Manhattan accountant, grew up in the shadow of Yankee Stadium in
what was then a middle-class Jewish, Irish and Italian
neighborhood. She was president of the Bronx High School of
Science's class of 1955 _ the second class to admit women _ went on
to Mount Holyoke College, married in 1961, had the first of her
three children in 1962, then spent the next 13 years as mother and
community volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   Mario M. Cuomo, lived a few blocks away. By 1975, when Cuomo was
secretary of state in Albany, Mrs. Lowey went to work for him. She
herself was assistant Secretary of State when she first ran for
Congress in 1998, beating Hamilton Fish III in the primary and the
incumbent Joseph DioGuardi in the general election. ``No one
thought I had a chance,'' she said. ``But I was able to get the
support from the community and raise the money. Sound familiar?''
</P>
<P>
   To run for Senate, Mrs. Lowey will have to give up her seat in
the House and her membership on the Appropriations Committee so she
can fly to Buffalo in snowstorms. Why would she do it?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very good question,'' her husband said. ``She doesn't
need it to satisfy any inner urge. On the other hand, she is a
political animal.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowey described his wife as a high-energy mother hen who worries
that he doesn't eat right when she's away. ``She is so concerned
that I'm going to starve,'' he said, ``that I'll be at the office
and she'll have meetings in the evening, and in between the
meetings, if she has half an hour, she'll run to the supermarket,
get a chicken, run home, put it in the oven and call me and say,
`You have chicken for dinner.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lowey said he has never been in danger of starving.

SCHOOLS HEAD PLANS TIGHTER SCREENING OF TEACHERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By NEIL MacFARQUHAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Responding to reports that substitute teachers who
repeatedly mistreat children are hired regularly, Schools
Chancellor Rudy Crew said Thursday that he would revive the
practice of centralized hiring.
</P>
<P>
   J.D. LaRock, a spokesman for the chancellor, said the chancellor
had decided to accept a recommendation that the New York City
school district adopt a system similar to that of Chicago. In that
system, substitute teachers approved by a central hiring office are
issued photo identification cards similar to automated teller
machine cards.
</P>
<P>
   Each school has a machine that reads the cards electronically,
and before a teacher is hired for the day the ``smart card'' must
be swiped through the machine, which tells the school that the
teacher has been approved. The system enables harried
administrators to verify at the last minute that a candidate is
qualified.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendation was contained in a report released Thursday
by Edward Stancik, the special commissioner of investigation for
the school district. ``You have subs who get fired at one place,
but they understand they can go to school after school with very
little chance that their past will catch up with them,'' Stancik
said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem occurs primarily because principals often find
themselves with a classroom full of children and no teacher at 8
a.m., so there is little time for background checks if they have
exhausted their rosters of regular substitutes with proven track
records, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``From talking to principals it is clear that there are a lot of
substitutes who can obtain positions because the schools are
desperate for a body at the last moment,'' Stancik said.
</P>
<P>
   The report, titled ``Recurring Nightmares: An Investigation into
the Repeated Hiring of Substitute Teachers Unfit to Care for
Children,'' detailed the cases of substitutes who were hired at one
public school after being dismissed elsewhere for inappropriate
behavior, including striking and whipping children, fondling them
and showing them disturbing pictures.
</P>
<P>
   LaRock said the chancellor hoped to have the system in place by
next fall at a cost of several million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Crew said he was troubled by the conduct
detailed in the special commissioner's report. ``I agree with his
recommendation that these people be barred from working in our
schools, as well as his suggestion that information about the poor
behavior of substitute personnel should be better collected and
distributed to our schools,'' Crew said.
</P>
<P>
   Finding and screening substitute teachers is a daily difficulty
in New York City schools. On any given day about 3,000 of the
70,000 teachers and support staff members are absent. Each year the
schools hire about 16,000 people as substitute teachers for roughly
$100 per day.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, budget cuts prompted the Board of Education to scrap a
central registry for substitutes. It became largely the task of
each principal in the city's 1,100 public schools to decide who
would be hired for the day.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The substitute system does not have sufficient safeguards in
it,'' said Stancik.
</P>
<P>
   His report outlined the failings of the system and detailed
eight cases in which teachers were hired at one school after being
dismissed from another for inappropriate behavior or after being
rejected for regular teaching jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Education maintains a list of teachers who are
ineligible to work in New York City schools, LaRock said, and the
list has 4,200 names on it.
</P>
<P>
   But the report said it is an ineffective system because
principals do not always have time to check the list.

SON OF INSURANCE TYCOON TO HEAD BIG BROKERAGE FIRM
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jeffrey Greenberg, the eldest son of one of the country's most
influential insurance executives, Maurice (Hank) Greenberg, on
Thursday was named president of Marsh &AMP; McLennan Cos., the world's
largest insurance brokerage, and was designated its next chief
executive and chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Greenberg, 47, had been an executive at Marsh for
only a little more than three years, but he has worked in insurance
for more than 20 years. He virtually grew up in the business as his
father was making the American International Group the unrivaled
American leader in commercial insurance.
</P>
<P>
   As the eventual chief of Marsh, the younger Greenberg will be
heading a company that supposedly conducts arms-length negotiations
to arrange insurance coverage for corporations by AIG and other
insurers.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint interview, Greenberg and A.J.C. Smith, who is
stepping down as chief executive at the end of 1999 and retiring in
2000, said they saw no conflict in having members of the same
family heading two important companies that serve different
functions in providing corporate coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's the slightest conflict of interest,''
Smith said. ``AIG gets business from Marsh and we depend on AIG to
provide insurance for our clients. It's a very mutually beneficial
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts said they did not expect conflicts to arise.
``These are both seasoned executives,'' said Ron Frank of Salomon
Smith Barney. ``They're going to be in charge of major corporations
with clients and shareholders to be accountable to. At the end of
the day, that is going to be the overriding factor motivating their
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger Greenberg had been regarded by many as the heir
apparent to his father when he resigned from AIG in 1995 saying, in
a statement, that he had no immediate job plans for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks earlier, Greenberg's younger brother, Evan, had been
promoted to executive vice president, making the two corporate
equals. In May of 1997, Evan Greenberg became president and chief
operating officer of AIG with his father, who is 73 and shows no
signs of stepping down, remaining as chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The senior Greenberg said in his own statement in 1995 that he
was ``personally saddened'' when his eldest son left AIG. American
International said Greenberg was traveling overseas Thursday and
the company said it had no comment on Jeffrey Greenberg's
promotion.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview Thursday, , Greenberg said he had not mentioned
the possibility of a promotion to his father before Marsh's board
made its decision. He said he had phoned his father's office after
the decision but had not reached him. He said he had a ``good
relationship'' with his father and that ``my brother and I are very
good friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg, who has degrees from Georgetown University Law School
and from Brown University, said he left AIG because ``I felt I
wanted to be in an environment away from my father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed working with him and I have a good relationship with
him,'' he said. ``But after a while it was time to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Within four months of leaving AIG, Greenberg was hired by Marsh
&AMP; McLennan, as a partner in Marsh &AMP; McLennan Capital, Inc., which
invests in insurance companies and insurance services companies. He
had spent the first two years of his insurance career at Marsh in
the 1970s. He became chairman and chief executive of the investment
unit in March 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts described Greenberg as an outgoing executive
who is likely to raise the profile of Marsh with more public
appearances than Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 64, presided over great growth at Marsh through the
acquisition of such big competitors as Johnson &AMP; Higgins in 1997
and the Sedgwick Group last August. One of the challenges for
Greenberg, said Burnett Hansen, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, is going to be ``finding new sources of growth.''

MIRIAM FREUND-ROSENTHAL,HADASSAH LEADER AND WRITER 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: N.Y., Fla., N.J., Minn., Israel)   By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Miriam Freund-Rosenthal, a former national president of
Hadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization of America, died on
Saturday at her home in Miami Beach. She was 92 and also had a home
in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Freund-Rosenthal persuaded the artist Marc Chagall to create
the stained glass windows for a synagogue in Jerusalem, endowed
Hadassah educational seminars in the United States and Israel and
wrote the book `A Tapestry of Hadassah Memories.'' She and her
second husband, Harry Rosenthal, also endowed clinics and parks in
Israel through Hadassah.
</P>
<P>
   During her presidency, from 1956 through 1960, a second hospital
was built for the Hadassah medical center in Jerusalem, in the Ein
Kerem neighborhood. It was dedicated in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Freund-Rosenthal, whose doctorate was in history from New
York University, was known as Miriam K. Freund when she was
Hadassah's president.
</P>
<P>
   With about 300,000 members, Hadassah says it is the United
States' largest women's organization, largest Jewish organization
and largest Zionist organization.
</P>
<P>
   Before and after Dr. Freund-Rosenthal was Hadassah's president,
she held a variety of other posts overseeing the organization's
education and youth programs. She was also prominent in other
Zionist and Jewish communal organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In a volume of memoirs, ``In My Lifetime'' (1989), she tells of
her visit with the violinist Isaac Stern to Chagall in France. The
artist agreed to create the design for the stained-glass windows
that were to be installed in the synagogue in the Ein Kerem
hospital complex, saying, ``I have always looked forward to a call
from the Jewish people.''
</P>
<P>
   Known as the Jerusalem windows, they have attracted immense
numbers of visitors over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Miriam Kottler Freund-Rosenthal was born in Brooklyn, the
daughter of Harry Kottler and the former Rebecca Zindler, and lived
in Perth Amboy, N.J., and Harlem as a child. She received a
bachelor's degree in 1925 from Hunter College and a master's degree
and doctorate from NYU. In 1935 she first visited what was then
Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   She taught in the New York City public school system for a
decade and a half until the early 1940s, and was prominent in
fund-raising for the founding of Brandeis University, which opened
in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Her other writings include the books ``Jewish Merchants in
Colonial America'' (1939) and ``Jewels for a Crown'' (1963).
</P>
<P>
   In 1927, she married Milton B. Freund, a financier active in
Jewish communal and religious affairs, who died in 1968. She
married Harry Rosenthal, a businessman in St. Paul, Minn. in 1974.
He died in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Her survivors include two sons, Dr. Matthew Freund of Miami
Beach; and Harry I. Freund of Harrison, N.Y. and Manhattan; 5
grandchildren; 10 great-grandchildren and 2 stepdaughters, Midge
Decter, the political writer, of Manhattan, and Connie Fields of
St. Paul.

   She went from a daily morning shift to a once-a-week slot on
Saturday evenings, playing the trouper without complaint, but PAULA
ZAHN has had enough. She is quitting CBS News to become an anchor
on the Fox News cable channel.
</P>
<P>
   Did she make the switch because she was not chosen as a
correspondent on the new CBS News magazine show ``60 Minutes II?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' said her agent, RICHARD LEIBNER. ``With three young
children, she was not interested in a job that called for the
travel commitment `60 II' would have required.'' (He, CBS and Fox
could not find Ms. Zahn for comment Thursday.)
</P>
<P>
   She goes from being the Saturday evening anchor of ``CBS Evening
News'' to a cable network that reaches far fewer households than
CBS. But she will be on twice a day: during the day, at a time not
yet chosen, and again from 7 to 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few women have ever been given the dinner-time, hard-news
broadcast slot,'' Leibner said. ``And it's an opportunity to
broadcast news twice a day, five days a week, and she has missed
that since she came off mornings.''
</P>
<P>
   She spent six years as co-anchor of ``CBS Morning News,'' until
the show was given a make-over in mid-1996 and she and HARRY SMITH
received new assignments _ she to the Saturday night anchor spot on
``CBS Evening News.'' By coincidence, Smith left CBS News last week
to become anchor of the ``Biography'' series on another cable

   Medical Matinee
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ KATHLEEN CHALFANT usually appears in ``Wit'' _ a play
about a professor battling cancer and chemotherapy while reveling
in the sonnets of John Donne _ at the Union Square Theater on East
17th Street. But on Tuesday, she and the other members of the cast
headed uptown to perform at Cornell University's Weill College of
Medicine on York Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all very nervous doing it for a roomful of doctors and
medical students,'' Ms. Chalfant said. ``But we got laughs we don't
ordinarily get. We got medical-student laughs _ they laughed at
things that medical students would find funny that other people
don't. There was a huge guffaw at the beginning of the grand rounds
scene. They recognized the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   DEBRA GILLERS, the associate dean of academic affairs, said the
performance was part of a new series of seminars on humanities and
medicine. She also said that Ms. Chalfant had initially asked why
the doctors and doctors-in-training should not simply go to the
theater. ``My thought was, when you bring it into their world and
they see the people responsible for their world _ the faculty, with
whom they interact in a very narrow world _ the relevance is more
immediate.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. ``One of the physicians came up and said, `I'm surprised
you didn't quote the John Donne poem about CPR,''' Ms. Chalfant
said. ``I went, `Huh?''' He was apparently referring to the sonnet
that begins ``Batter my heart, three-person'd God.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Invited to a $500-a-person dinner that raises money
for baseball players who did not have million-dollar contracts and
do not have million-dollar pensions, JIM PALMER said yes first and
asked the question later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was taught by Cal Ripken Sr., and also by the Orioles: If
you live in a community, be involved,'' he said. ``Baseball is a
community, so this dinner is important. I said, `By the way, who
are you honoring?'''
</P>
<P>
   The answer was the 1969 Mets, who went from 100-to-1 odds during
spring training to World Series champions for the first time in the
team's eight-year history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `That's like inviting me to New York to go the dentist
and filling the cavities without Novocaine,'' said Palmer, who
pitched Game 3 at Shea Stadium and lost to the likes of TOM SEAVER,
JERRY KOOSMAN and TOMMIE AGEE, all of whom attended the dinner on
Tuesday at the Marriott Marquis Hotel in Manhattan.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ RICHARD J. SCHWARTZ, an investor who was the chief
executive of Jonathan Logan until he negotiated the sale of the
company in 1985, is the new chairman of the New York State Council
on the Arts.
</P>
<P>
   He has been a member of the council's board and a trustee of
Lincoln Center and the Westchester Council for the Arts, but his
biography did not mention something that worked in his favor in
Albany, where there is a long tradition of naming financial backers
to honorary posts: He is a major donor to Republican committees and
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   So was his predecessor as chairman of the arts council, EARLE
MACK, who gave $10,000 to Gov. George Pataki's campaign last year.

<P>
   In rapturous waves, they stand and cheer, their ecstatic smiles
as wide and lingering as his, their eyes as joyful. What does it
matter that Bill Clinton is on trial for perjury and obstruction of
justice? Look at his supporters _ at his fans. He is a president at
the peak of his popularity.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 19 the president delivered his State-of-the-Union
message to Congress. He described a country in its best shape in
years, where almost every indicator ticks towards improvement.
</P>
<P>
   America is in its eighth year of economic boom. Both federal and
state budgets are in surplus, even awash with money. The
unemployment rate, at 4.3 percent, is the lowest for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   In the big cities, murder rates have fallen by a fifth; the
crack epidemic has faded; even abortion rates and rates of teenage
pregnancy are falling. Gasoline is as cheap as it was between the
world wars, and baseball home runs at their highest ever.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder, you might conclude, that Clinton's popularity
knows no bounds. According to the latest USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll,
81 percent of the public now judge his presidency a success, and 69
percent approve of his overall job performance.
</P>
<P>
   And yet these figures and are also surreal and bizarre. Before
they dutifully trooped over to the House of Representatives to hear
the president's speech, the senators had been engaged in quite
other business: sitting as a silent jury to consider whether
Clinton should be removed from office. And, the next day, they
returned there.
</P>
<P>
   Small forests have been felled in the effort to explain why,
despite the disgrace of impeachment, the president's party and the
public still cling to him with such devotion.
</P>
<P>
   It is as though the president's supporters and his attackers are
moving in different worlds. But they are not. Both sides are
enjoying the extraordinary good times, and both sides are well
aware that they have been comprehensively lied to by this
president.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the loyalty are complicated. And though some of
them are justified, they are mainly rooted in a mixture of
opportunism and delusion.
</P>
<P>
   Take the Democrats first. On Tuesday, they roared their
appreciation of Clinton. And, looking back some years, the party
owes a lot to him. He united its warring factions under a centrist
banner, allied the party to alien concepts of fiscal probity and
free trade, and won two elections on the strength of it.
</P>
<P>
   The modern Democrats are his party; they have no one else
approaching his political talent, and few who can match his
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, in August, the picture was very different. Then,
after the president's televised non-apology about his conduct in
the Monica Lewinsky case, party members were moving fast away from
him.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Joseph Lieberman, in a speech that summed up the mood of
the party, called Clinton's actions ``wrong and unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   So what has changed now? Not the president's offenses; Democrats
still admit that these cannot be defended. Not the sense of
betrayal; colleagues once lied to will always have been lied to.
</P>
<P>
   What has changed is the political calculation. November's
midterm elections, in which the Democrats astonishingly won seats
in the House, showed that Clinton was not, in fact, a political
liability. And the spiteful, even unethical, handling of the
impeachment proceedings by the House Republicans rallied the
Democrats behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Without the rotten behavior of the president's enemies, it is a
reasonable bet that his party would not be displaying such loyalty
towards him. And if the conduct of the trial, against expectation,
becomes more neutral rather than more partisan, some of that
wafer-thin fidelity may begin to tear.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are also aware that, by supporting the president, they
are reflecting the public mood. The American people have been
unwavering: all year, by two-thirds majorities, they have wanted to
keep this president in office. They approve of the job he is doing.
</P>
<P>
   For as long as it has existed, the job-performance poll has
always been linked to the state of the economy. Inevitably, when
people feel prosperous, they feel happy with the man who presides
over that prosperity; they do not want to rock the boat by
replacing him.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this loyalty, too, has its threadbare side. Most Americans
are shrewd enough to know that economic prosperity is not something
presidents bring. It is caused by cyclical factors, by the ups and
downs of trading partners, by careful tinkering at the Federal
Reserve; even Clinton's commitment to balanced budgets, while
useful, is small beer.
</P>
<P>
   He is, above all, a manager; and the disappearance of one
manager, and his replacement by another, need not be so traumatic.
But what the public seems to imagine it will lose if Clinton goes
is more complex, and more peculiar, than that.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's great strengths when he arrived in office were his
energy and his empathy. His energy is flagging now, but his ability
to connect with the common man remains as impressive as ever.
</P>
<P>
   He has never placed himself on a pedestal before Americans: he
is one of them. Therefore, when he cheats and lies, he is also one
of them: flawed, human, fallible. Therefore, when his critics
attack him for actual crimes, they are being moralistic and
sanctimonious.
</P>
<P>
   When those critics then display partisan animus against him,
Clinton becomes the underdog who wins the public's sympathy for the
simple reason that he keeps on fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this sympathy, like the loyalty of his own party, does not
run deep. When people were asked, in that same USA Today poll,
whether they thought him honest, 76 percent said no. His contempt
for the law has been noted.
</P>
<P>
   Of course he is only human, only a manager; in prosperous and
peaceful times, people demand little more of their president.
Perhaps his critics should leave him alone.
</P>
<P>
   But another argument seems just as pertinent: if this man is so
ordinary, so willfully untouched by the duties and dignity of his
office, there seems no reason why Americans should be so keen to
keep him. &QL;

<P>
   Another massacre, more denials and dissemblings, the usual
pitiful survivors' tales. This time it was 45 ethnic Albanians,
including old men and children, who had been shot dead, probably at
close range.
</P>
<P>
   The only new twist was the Serbian authorities' behavior after
the killings _ the expulsion of a senior international monitor, and
the spiriting away of the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   This was outrageous even by the standards of the region, and the
world is justified in holding Yugoslavia's President Slobodan
Milosevic responsible. So is it time for NATO's long-threatened air
strikes against the Serbs?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the ``verifiers'' of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe have reported strong prima facie evidence
that the killings were carried out in cold blood by Serbs, probably
in uniform. (They had blamed many previous cease-fire violations on
ethnic Albanians.)
</P>
<P>
   And certainly NATO would make a fool of itself if Milosevic
refused to abide by last October's cease-fire agreement and the
alliance then failed to carry out its threat to bomb Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   If air strikes become the only way of averting a catastrophic
loss of western moral authority, they will have to be carried out.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, however, a bombing campaign would not in itself
be enough to meet all the challenges posed by Serb brutishness _
and the killings, kidnappings and intimidation by ethnic-Albanian
fighters _ in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   For a start, one consequence could be more deaths of old people
and children. Among the risks of a bombing campaign is that it
would trigger bloody fighting in Pristina, Kosovo's capital.
</P>
<P>
   If the western world crosses that Rubicon, and conducts an air
campaign against a sovereign country of nearly 11 million people,
it will have to acknowledge, more clearly than hitherto, its
responsibility for the future of the rump Yugoslav state,
consisting of Serbia (including Kosovo) and Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   This would mean not only deploying armed peacekeepers to police
whatever cease-fire agreement were eventually reached, but setting
out an internationally agreed formula for the political future of
the federation and then putting intense pressure on the parties to
accept it.
</P>
<P>
   That should be done in any event, even if Milosevic backs down
this time and a bombing campaign is averted. Recent diplomatic
efforts have shown that there is virtually no chance of Serbs and
Albanians freely reaching agreement by themselves.
</P>
<P>
   What should that internationally agreed formula be? It will
somehow have to accommodate two principles. The first is that nasty
microbes fester whenever large numbers of people are subjected to
rule they regard as illegitimate, alien and intolerable.
</P>
<P>
   One of the worst effects is the spawning of insurgencies in
which thugs terrorize their own communities and dabble heavily in
crime, as well as harassing the hated rulers.
</P>
<P>
   The other principle is that, especially after the 1975 Helsinki
agreement, sovereign states should not be broken up by force, even
when (as in Bosnia) many citizens have voted for parties committed
to terminating the state's existence.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing to prevent states breaking up by consensus, as
Czechoslovakia did in 1993, and that may eventually happen in
Yugoslavia. But to countenance the violent, non-consensual breakup
of Serbia would be to invite a similar fate for Macedonia, Albania,
Bosnia, possibly even Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   How can those two principles be reconciled? First, by calling
immediately and unequivocally for the elevation of Kosovo to the
status of the third republic, coequal with Serbia and Montenegro,
in the Yugoslav federation.
</P>
<P>
   Then by offering international guarantees and, if necessary,
peacekeepers to protect enclaves in Kosovo that are either heavily
populated by Serbs (in the north, for example) or regarded as Serb
holy places.
</P>
<P>
   That would give the lie to the Serb nationalists' belief that
the outside world has some racist bias against them, and establish
the principle that Serbs do not need to commit massacres to protect
their people or their heritage. &QL;

SOCIAL PROMOTION IS BAD; REPEATING A GRADE MAY BE WORSE
</HEADLINE>

children. No other changes.)  (fe)

<TEXT>
<P>
   When President Clinton announced in his State of the Union
address this week that he wanted the federal government to press
schools to end ``social promotion,'' he was stepping into a
longstanding, mine-laden educational debate: When students fail, is
it better to have them repeat the grade or promote them to the next
grade to keep them with their age group?
</P>
<P>
   The president, in effect, is opting to hold them back. And while
it may seem obvious that promoting failing students does no one any
good _ giving parents and students false notions of their progress
and forcing teachers to dumb down curriculums _ most studies argue
against making pupils repeat grades.
</P>
<P>
   Students held back once usually end up doing somewhat worse in
school and have a smaller chance of graduating than equivalent
students allowed to move to the next grade. And youngsters held
back twice nearly always drop out.
</P>
<P>
   Few advocate social promotion _ moving pupils from one grade to
the next irrespective of their performance _ without remediation.
But most researchers say the alternative of making them repeat the
grade, known as retention, is worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The term `social promotion' carries so much emotion,''
commented C. Thomas Holmes, head of the department of educational
leadership at the University of Georgia, who analyzed 63 studies on
the issue. ``It sounds like we're letting kids get away with things
they didn't earn. But we are not stopping to ask what it is and
what we could do to avoid it rather than outlaw it.''
</P>
<P>
   School systems have seesawed between the two policies for
decades. Increasingly, educational researchers say that the choice
is a false one and that what is needed is a third way: early
identification of failing students and intensive intervention
through one-on-one tutoring, after-school programs and summer
school. But that costs a great deal of money.
</P>
<P>
   The president and his education advisers are aware of the need,
which is why they are also asking for a tripling of federal funds
for summer school and after-school programs to $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that even this would cover only a small portion
of what is needed nationally for such programs. The demand is
greatest not in suburban schools, where one or two students per
class might be held back each year, but in inner-city schools,
where 10 to 15 percent of a class face retention.
</P>
<P>
   Federal funds account for only about 7 percent of money spent on
education around the country. And since federal funds go to the
neediest schools, where failure is most common, some analysts are
concerned that schools with high failure rates will stop social
promotion, as demanded by the federal government, but will not
obtain the funds or structure to help students who are held back.
The result could be more harm than good.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think the argument against retention is that it hurts
self-esteem,'' said Lorrie A. Shepard, a professor of education at
the University of Colorado at Boulder, who was co-editor of the
book ``Flunking Grades: Research and Policies on Retention''
(Palmer Press, 1989). ``My position is, yes, it hurts self-esteem,
but I am not arguing against it on that basis. I am saying that
there is already an enormous amount of it going on, and research
shows that retention doesn't help achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   While most of the research supports Ms. Shepard's assertion, a
study in the Baltimore public schools contradicts it. Karl
Alexander, a sociologist at Johns Hopkins University, along with
two co-authors, published ``On the Success of Failure'' (Cambridge
University Press, 1994) in which he found that, on balance,
retention was slightly preferable to social promotion.
</P>
<P>
   The authors wrote, ``Having children repeat a year can and does
help academically; moreover, at least for children like those in
Baltimore, it does not compromise self-regard.'' But they added
that retention was no panacea, that ``a lasting solution requires
more than simply going over the same material twice.''

</P>
<P>
   Alexander added by telephone: ``These kids start out far behind.
For lots of them, retention stops the free fall.''
</P>
<P>
   His work also contradicts a 1980 study by Kaoru Yamamoto, a
psychologist at the University of Colorado school of education, who
examined the effects of stress on children. In his study, children
said going blind or losing a parent were the only two life events
that would be more stressful than being held back.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL GRAFS)
</P>
<P>
   There are no good statistics on the number of students held back
or promoted annually but reliable estimates are that by the eighth
grade, between 20 and 50 percent of students have been held back
once. Numbers beyond the eighth grade have less meaning because
pupils are more often asked to repeat a course rather than an
entire year.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments against social promotion are many. The American
Federation of Teachers issued a study in 1997 in which the group
noted that if the United States is to move to more rigorous
academic standards, social promotion has no place.
</P>
<P>
   It said that social promotion harms youngsters, ``who are
deluded into thinking they have learned the knowledge and skills
necessary for success,'' as well as teachers, ``who must deal with
impossibly wide disparities in their students' preparation and
achievement'' and ``who face students who know that teachers wield
no credible authority to demand hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   It also harms the business community, which has to invest
millions of dollars in teaching new employees basic skills they
should have learned in school, and taxpayers, whose support of
public education is eroded, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   But the union study added that retention was equally rampant and
harmful. It too urged a comprehensive set of remedies, including
rigorous standards, early intervention and well-trained
specialists.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   New York City has gone through both swings of this pendulum. In
the late 1970s, Frank J. Macchiarola, who was school chancellor,
sought to end social promotion through testing and retention
combined with summer school. He says the policy was starting to
work when he left office and his successor, Anthony J. Alvarado,
put a stop to it. Others remember it as problematic, with a number
of students forced to repeat grades two or three times.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL GRAF)
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons retention nationally is likely to increase if
Clinton's plan is put into place is the growing use everywhere of
tests to move from one grade to the next. When there is a cutoff,
many will not make it.
</P>
<P>
   The president held up Chicago as a new model of a system ending
social promotion and improving its students' test scores. But Ms.
Shepard of the University of Colorado said much of the success
comes from summers spent ``teaching to the test,'' meaning that
failing students are given drills aimed at helping them pass the
tests. They may not actually be making much real progress, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall S. Smith, the deputy education secretary, acknowledged
in a telephone interview that the president's plan, even if
financed at the requested level, would fill only a small portion of
the need for summer and after-school programs.
</P>
<P>
   (ARTICLE CAN END HERE)
</P>
<P>
   He said there were 15 to 20 applicants this year for every such
available federal program and the number of applicants is likely to
rise when word of increased funds gets out.
</P>
<P>
   But he said it was important to see the ending of social
promotion in the context of a number of steps being taken by the
government, including reducing class size, pushing for school
report cards so parents can choose better and improving teacher
quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people to be conscious of a whole approach, not just
to knee-jerk into retention,'' Smith said. ``Clearly, there are
going to be bad practices in a country with 95,000 schools. But the
federal government can influence states and local districts to have
a policy which includes this general strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Some educators are dubious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be willing to discuss abandoning social promotion if we
had year-round schooling or successful intervention,'' said Ronald
O. Ross, superintendent of the Mount Vernon city schools, a heavily
African-American system north of New York City. ``We already know
what we need to know about education, but we're not willing to put
up the money. I'd like all these people to take a deep breath and
think about a 6-year-old girl in first grade sitting next to a
10-year-old boy.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Theodore R. Sizer, former dean of the Harvard University
Graduate School of Education, who runs a charter school in western
Massachusetts, said he is struck by what he considers the flawed
diagnosis that what American children need is more and more
testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People with cancer often run high temperatures, but that
doesn't mean what they need is aspirin,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL GRAFS)
</P>
<P>
   Educators also point to the fact that other countries do not
hold back their pupils the way Americans do yet still have widely
admired systems.
</P>
<P>
   According to the 1994 International Encyclopedia of Teaching and
Teacher Education, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Japan and South Korea
all have automatic promotion policies, under which no pupil is held
back.
</P>
<P>
   Marc S. Tucker of the National Center on Education and the
Economy, an advocate of national standards who has studied the
Danish system, said Danish pupils have the same teacher for the
first six to nine years of school. Moreover, while high school in
Denmark is quite rigorous, the first years of school are seen as
more social than academic.

   ``He's just stepped away from his desk.'' The age-old
secretarial excuse for absent bosses depends for its shred of
credibility on a dying technology: the wired telephone.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt secretaries will continue to offer it. But the
mind-boggling price that the markets are putting on the new
Vodafone/AirTouch combination _ their capitalizations will create
the world's ninth-largest telecoms business _ is the clearest
signal yet of a switch of telecoms from land to air.
</P>
<P>
   The new Vodafone is worth three times as much as Yahoo!, that
darling of the Internet share bubble. Mobile telephones have
changed the lives of many more people than the much-hyped Internet
_ and equally radically.
</P>
<P>
   Stupendous as the growth of the Internet has been, it remains
mainly an American phenomenon. The United States accounts for more
than 90 percent of the most-visited Internet sites and about half
of all users.
</P>
<P>
   The boom in the mobile phone has been more of a European and
Asian phenomenon. American companies have been slow to sell digital
phones; slow to charge the caller, rather than the recipient of the
call; and slow to develop a single national network.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile in Europe, mobile phones have been an island of
deregulation amid a sea of old monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   A common digital standard (its replacement is a bone of
contention between Europe and America) allows users to call home
from Shanghai and Sydney to Reykjavik and Rimini. Little surprise
that Europe is home to two of the world's biggest mobile-phone
makers _ and now to its largest mobile-communications firm.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, analysts are still struggling to explain where
the profits will come from. No need for that with mobile
telephones.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two years, more than half of new telephone
subscriptions have been to mobile phones. In Finland, indeed, 53
percent of all telephones are mobile.
</P>
<P>
   Youngsters, off to university or to a new apartment, see no
point in paying for a fixed line when their lives are mobile _ and
the habit, once learned, will stay.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet and data transmission may prolong the life of fixed
lines. But the future of talk will be mobile.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, new mobile markets are still emerging. The latest,
flourishing in Europe more than in America, is for prepaid
mobile-telephones, which now account for 80 percent of new sales
for some firms.
</P>
<P>
   Talk has become like chocolate: you can buy it in the
supermarket or give it (in rationed quantities) to your children,
and companies can offer it free with their products.
</P>
<P>
   Governments, still fixated by the goal of universal service,
have hardly begun to consider the implications of a world in which
telephone time is bought over the counter.
</P>
<P>
   Other innovations will follow. Wireless allows many products,
from cars to tamagotchi, to incorporate communications as
inconspicuously as they already do computer chips.
</P>
<P>
   But already, the growth of wireless is changing the way people
think about the telephone. For one thing, the mobile telephone is a
personal instrument, not a communal one.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the car freed people from the inconvenience of communal
transport, so the mobile is a liberation. That appeals especially
to the young. A mobile-telephone number is a piece of data about a
person, not a household.
</P>
<P>
   Its enormous value is something that _ for all the blather about
Internet ``portals'' _ telephone companies have barely started to
consider.
</P>
<P>
   Equally, wireless will change the significance of location.
Time-zone and cost now matter more than mere distance. Indeed, in
some ways, the mobile telephone dispenses with physical geography
even more effectively than does the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   To tap into their e-mail, most folk still have to plug in
somewhere in the world (although that too will change as new mobile
gadgets develop). But to take that call, they can be anywhere the
signal reaches. Including away from their desk. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   At the start of the decade, with communism vanquished and
socialism reeling from a crushing sideways blow, it was tempting to
write off the left in Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The right was triumphantly entrenched in government in Germany
and Britain and, by 1993, in France, the other big European power,
too. Defeat for the right looked about as likely as the birth of a
single European currency.
</P>
<P>
   How times have changed. These days, European voters have almost
universally rejected parties of the right, turning instead to the
reinvigorated, reinvented left _ and not only in Germany, Britain
and France.
</P>
<P>
   Today in the EU, the right rules alone only in Spain (and, in a
special form, in Ireland).
</P>
<P>
   Across the Union, parties of the right look demoralized, divided
and lost.
</P>
<P>
   In scrambling about for a way out of the electoral wilderness,
one route has begun to catch the eye of the right: nationalism.
This direction may offer some promising ideas. It certainly
presents some grave dangers.
</P>
<P>
   The revival of a nationalist program for the right has its
temptations. Parties of the right in opposition face a basic
choice: whether to try to seize back the center ground that they
have ceded to the new left, or to look for a clear, bold message
that sets them quite apart.
</P>
<P>
   A nationalist message offers just such a distinction. It chimes
with popular insecurities about globalization. And it is all the
more compelling these days in the face of intensifying efforts at
European unification.
</P>
<P>
   Since the launch of Europe's single currency on Jan. 1, if not
before, it has become plain that EU leaders are pressing ahead with
political integration.
</P>
<P>
   Although some Europeans, notably Italians, may be quite pleased
by the prospect of being increasingly governed by foreigners, the
thought sends a shiver down the spine of others. In any event,
plans for European integration in the coming years will challenge
national sovereignty still further.
</P>
<P>
   Right or wrong, there is a respectable case against European
integration to be made, one that resonates with worries about
national identity. This is the case that William Hague, leader of
Britain's Conservative Party, drew on when he outlined on Jan. 19
his ``British Way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Transferring power from Westminster to Brussels,'' among other
pieces of ``constitutional vandalism,'' he declared, ``strikes at
the core of our national identity.''
</P>
<P>
   When, the previous day, France had ratified the Amsterdam
treaty, which pulls the European Union a bit closer together, a
less sophisticated version of the message had been thundered out by
Charles Pasqua, once a French right-wing interior minister: this
week's ratification, he recalled, symbolically took place on the
anniversary of the proclamation of the German empire in 1871.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so (reasonably) respectable. But flirting with
nationalism can be a dangerous game. It can encourage the sorts of
populist fears that give rise to a far more frightening variety:
the xenophobia of the extreme right.
</P>
<P>
   It would be absurd to suggest that all politicians who draw on
nationalist feeling to criticize European integration pander, by
definition, to racists. Most do not.
</P>
<P>
   But the danger nonetheless exists that by fanning the
nationalist fire, even with genuine concerns about, say, an influx
of job-seekers from Eastern Europe in an expanded EU, nationalists
stoke up the sort of populist xenophobia on which the far right
thrives.
</P>
<P>
   This is why it was worrying to see members of Germany's
center-right Christian Democratic Union, which held power in Bonn
for 16 years until last September, take to the streets this week.
</P>
<P>
   They, and their more right-wing Bavarian counterparts in the
Christian Social Union, were doing so to gather signatures for a
petition against proposed changes in Germany's nationality laws.
The new government wants to make it easier for foreigners, notably
Turks, born and brought up in Germany to get a German passport.
</P>
<P>
   The critics, uneasy about this, object in particular to plans to
allow dual citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   It may be that, up to a point, stern words from the moderate
right about racial issues and immigration can steal the thunder of
the far right.
</P>
<P>
   One reason, other than its first-past-the-post voting system,
that Britain has been spared the growth of an extreme-right party
is that the Conservative Party extends farther to the right than
most of its continental counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   If it panders to the fears that the far right plays upon,
however, the moderate right will lend these fears respectability.
It may encourage the xenophobes who attack black and brown
Europeans. And it will discredit itself in the eyes of decent
voters who want nothing to do with racist bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   Which way to deal with anti-immigrant prejudice is the choice
that the French right now faces, thanks to a split in the National
Front, France's nasty far-right party.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend one of the Front's two camps meets to decide its
future. Although many center-right French politicians refuse even
to dignify the Front with the term ``political party,'' there will
be others who see in its implosion a chance to mop up some of its
vote.
</P>
<P>
   The right has been battered across the European Union in recent
years, defeated and outflanked by the new left. It is desperate for
a program around which it could return to power.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is a respectable nationalist agenda, the right
would be wise to pay close attention to the difference between that
and the xenophobic brand. It plays unthinkingly with nationalism at
its peril. &QL;
