<HEADLINE> Pakistan "Disappointed" at Omission of Kashmir from </HEADLINE>

<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has taken a
serious exception to the omission of a substantive reference to
the India-Pakistan question in the Report of the U.N. Secretary
General on the Work of the Organization for 1997, a Foreign Office
spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's Permanent Representative at the U.N. has already
conveyed to the Secretary General "our deep disappointment on his
omission which tends to erode the credibility of the Organization
and its efficacy in fulfilling its primary responsibilities on a
global basis," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Jammu and Kashmir issue is on the agenda of the Security
Council, he said.
</P>
<P>
"A less than explicit reference in a bureaucratic report does
not detract from the significance of this issue in the United
Nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, the spokesman said, will continue to strongly espouse
the Kashmir cause at the United Nations and spare no effort in
ensuring that the United Nations delivers on its solemn pledge to
the Kashmiri people.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Cyprus Coordinator Arrives for Peace Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Special Coordinator for
Cyprus, Thomas Miller, today called on parties involved in the
Cyprus problem to focus their attention on efforts to facilitate
a solution and avoid dealing with pedantics.
</P>
<P>
Miller made the call upon his arrival in Cyprus on the last
leg of his current regional tour which had taken him to Ankara
and Athens.
</P>
<P>
Miller said his visit to Cyprus, which is the first one since
his appointment a couple of months ago, is "to do a lot of
listening".
</P>
<P>
He said "President Bill Clinton is very very interested in
coming up with a solution to the Cyprus problem and Secretary of
State Albright is intimately familiar with the issues, and very
very interested in working to facilitate a solution to a problem
that has gone on far too long."
</P>
<P>
Noting this period is "critical", Miller said a lot of work
needs to be done, and added "I know that any difficult problem,
and most definitely the Cyprus problem is in that category,
necessitates a certain give-and-take by the parties."
</P>
<P>
"No-one gets everything they want, that is the definition
of a successful negotiation," he remarked.
</P>
<P>
He described his talks in Ankara as "very productive", and in
Athens as "excellent", but refrained from disclosing any details
about the discussions.
</P>
<P>
Miller is scheduled to have meetings with Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash next
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Miller's visit came following the two rounds of U.N.-led
direct talks between Clerides and Denktash in July and August,
which ended in failure.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official is expected to make preparations for a visit
to the region by U.S. Presidential Emissary on Cyprus, Richard
Holbrooke, scheduled for later this year.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey sent troops
and took over one third of the island nation in the wake of a
failed coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece. The
United Nations and the international community have been working
for decades to reunite the Turkish Cypriot north and Greek Cypriot
south, but so far no concrete results have been achieved.

agreement here today the implementation of a general agreement on
peace and national reconciliation in their country.
</P>
<P>
At a joint news conference, Rakhmonov and Nuri promised to
make joint efforts in opposing the armed forces that are blocking

Rakhmonov, who said he would work with Nuri, said that they
share the same aim of reviving Tajikistan, achieving peace and
stability and improving the people's living standards.

Reconciliation Committee, otherwise they would lose the people's
support.
</P>
<P>
Since Tajikistan declared independence in September 1991, the
country has been plagued with a civil war. On June 27, 1997, the
government and the UTO signed the general agreement on peace and
national reconciliation.

<P>
In the waiting room at Beijing Railway Station, travelers were
flocked around more than 30 Television sets to watch the opening
of the congress.
</P>
<P>
"What the folks from the northeast care most about is whether
the congress can help the state-owned enterprises to make
profits," said He Shoucai, who lives in the old industrial base of
Shenyang. He came to the station four hours ahead of his departure
time just to watch the telecast of the congress.
</P>
<P>
At 10 a.m., a stock trading agency in the East District was
crowded with stock investors heatedly discussing the reform of the
stock system as referred to today by Jiang Zemin in his work
report.
</P>
<P>
"I think that the shares issued by the state-owned enterprises
are promising," said Liu Wei. Calling himself "a professional
stock investor," Liu believed that these factories will be
extricated from their difficulties after the congress.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xiaolin, a taxi driver, listened to the broadcast while
on the road.
</P>
<P>
"Many of the customers have discussed the Party Congress with
me recently. They care about it," he said, hoping that the policy
of reform and opening-up will remain unchanged.
</P>

Wang bought a car and joined the taxi business several years

banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory, and carry forward in an all-round
way the great cause of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics to the 21st century."
</P>

This fully shows that the third generation of leaders with
Jiang Zemin at the core has the spirit to carry forward the cause
and forge ahead into the future, he said.

Moreover, Yin said, "after hearing the report, I feel very
encouraged, and am confident in my country's revitalization in the

<HEADLINE> Cypriot FM Satisfied with European Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Foreign Minister
Ioannis Kasoulides today expressed satisfaction with his European
tour, saying the outcome of the tour was "positive."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Cyprus radio, the foreign minister
said he was satisfied with the contacts with his European
counterparts and the assurances by officials who had recently
expressed negative views on Cyprus' European Union (EU) accession
course.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides' tour was mainly aimed at discussing the issue of
Cyprus' bid to become a European Union member.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot foreign minister expected that the EU will make a
decision in December on when to start accession talks with
candidate countries.
</P>
<P>
The EU reaffirmed its decision in July that the accession
talks with Cyprus will begin in early 1998.
</P>
<P>
With regard to a formula about the participation of Turkish
Cypriots in the accession talks, he said when the Turkish
Cypriot community accepts the principle of entry into the EU and
its representation as part of the official Cyprus delegation,
"there are ways for Turkish Cypriots to participate."
</P>
<P>
The minister also said that during his 13-day tour which
concluded today, he had the chance to calm down concerns
expressed by the EU member states on the deployment of the
Russian S-300 anti-aircraft missiles in Cyprus in mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government will negotiate a solution to the Cyprus
problem with "good will and a constructive spirit" and once a
proposal by Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides for the island's
demilitarization was accepted, there would be no need for the
deployment of the surface-to-air missiles, Kasoulides said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Kasoulides was due in Athens today on his
way back home to brief Greek officials on the outcome of his
European tour, which had taken him to Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania,
Germany, Luxembourg and Italy.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to meet with his Greek counterpart Theodoros
Pangalos, Foreign Under-Secretary Yiannos Kranidiotis and
Alternate Foreign Minister George Papandreou to discuss issues
including Turkey's threats for the "gradual integration" of
northern Cyprus with Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
took over the northern third of the island in the wake of a
short-lived coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared unilaterally a breakaway "The
Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" in 1983, which has been
recognized only by Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Improvement of Productivity Urged in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 12 (Xinhua) -- A Zimbabwean economist today
said organized labor, private sector and the government should
realize the need for high productivity facing strong competition
stemming from the opening up of most sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
John Makamure, chief economist of the Zimbabwe National
Chamber of Commerce, noted that lack of effective communication
between management and staff stifles efforts by companies to
boost productivity and improve the quality of products.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''lack of communication has been the major handicap
to efforts to improve productivity and what we need is a clear
sense of direction and commitment from both management and
employees.''
</P>
<P>
Makamure pointed out that most companies had, instead of
addressing the issue of productivity, resorted to other
cost-cutting measures that included down-sizing and
retrenchments.
</P>
<P>
''Despite these measures, they are still unable to compete
against products from other parts of the world because all
important decisions affecting company are not communicated to the
lower level employees,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Makamure's comments follow recent moves by the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) to improve productivity in
the region widely viewed as the future economic hub of the
continent.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is the only member of the regional grouping which
has established a productivity institute while other member
states have in principle shown interest in setting up similar
organizations to spearhead research in this area.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Crackdown on Illegal Alcohol Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris
Yeltsin today urged a crackdown on illegal trafficking in alcohol
and tougher controls on domestic sales.
</P>
<P>
In a routine national speech on radio, Yeltsin said the alcohol
industries suffered a decline in production and experienced sharp
losses in profits because of illegal production and smuggling and
sales of unlicensed and unauthorized alcohol.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin rated the crime second only to economic swindling,
which has caused huge economic losses to the country. The crime
has profited illegal traffickers and corrupt officials while the
country's revenues have been reduced by half, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the dangers of the "bootleg" alcohol to human
health. The mortality of alcoholism has doubled over the recent
five years in Russia, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin made a similar appeal last December and enacted
relevant laws and regulations. But enforcement was not too
effective since one-third of the sales of Russian alcohol is still
under the control of illegal traffickers.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that 30 to 50 percent of the alcohol in the
current Russian market is of inferior quality.

Party as various delegations to the Congress began panel discussions
of the report this afternoon here.
</P>
<P>
Li Wenhai, president of the People's University of China and a
delegate from Beijing, said that Comrade Jiang Zemin's report has
a clear theme, is based on today's realities and gears to the
future, he said.
</P>
<P>
The CPC has been making painstaking efforts in exploring ways
to adapt Marxism to China's conditions, that is, to combine the
two, ever since the national liberation in 1949, the university
president stated. It is the requirement of both history and
reality to establish Deng Xiaoping Theory as the guiding ideology
of the Party, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Zhiren, Party secretary of the Shandong Teachers
University, said Jiang's report was underlined by his call for
holding high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory. It is a
highly condensed statement that Deng Xiaoping Theory is Marxism of
present-day China, representing a new stage of development of
Marxism in China, he commented.
</P>
<P>
Doje Ridan, party secretary of Huangnan Autonomous Prefecture
of Tibetan Nationality in northwest China's Qinghai Province, said
the most splendid part in Jiang Zemin's report was the part "In
China today, it is Deng Xiaoping Theory, which integrates Marxism
with the practice of present-day China and the features of the
times, and this theory alone, that can settle the issues
concerning the future and destiny of socialism."
</P>
<P>
This conclusion, Doje Ridan said, is drawn from the experiences
of the CPC over the past few decades, including its setbacks.
</P>
<P>
Liu Rongchang, director of the Institute of Microbiology of the
Hebei Academy of Sciences, said an important aspect of Deng
Xiaoping Theory is to emancipate the mind and seek truth from the
facts.
</P>
<P>
Emancipating the mind means, among other things, breaking away
with the force of habit and assimilating new ideas, he said.
</P>
<P>
Gu Xiulian, Minister of Chemical Industry, said that Jiang's
report elevates the Party line adopted since the Third Plenary
Session of the 11th Central Committee to a new high. It has unique
features of the times and serves as a political declaration of
Party's third generation of leadership, she added.
</P>
<P>
The report broke through people's conventional ideas about the
forms of public ownership while upholding its dominant position,
the minister commented, adding it is of great significance.

<HEADLINE> PLA Delegates Say: Jiang's Report Inspiring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The report delivered by Jiang
Zemin at the opening session of the 15th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) which opened here today is one that
inspires people to forge ahead, agreed delegates from Chinese
People's Liberation Army (PLA) in a panel discussion this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The delegates expressed their determination to work hard and
make concerted efforts to advance the cause of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics under the leadership of the CPC
Central Committee with Jiang at the core.
</P>
<P>
The delegates agreed that the report is a programmatic document
guiding the whole Party, whole army and people of all ethnic
groups of the country into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Holding high the banner of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics serves as the theme of the congress,
said Li Laizhu of the PLA delegation.
</P>
<P>
The issue of banner is a fundamental issue which has a vital
bearing on the fate of the Party and the country, he said, adding
that facts have shown that there is a great promise for the cause
of socialism so long as we hold high the great banner of the
Deng Xiaoping Theory in the new historical period.
</P>
<P>
Another PLA delegate Du Tiehuan believes that the realization
of the strategic goals set forth in Jiang's report
demands a close unity of the whole Party, the whole army and
people across the country and their joint efforts.
</P>
<P>
Du said that it is vital to consciously maintain the
authoritativeness of the CPC Central Committee with Jiang at the
core for this is the important guarantee for an all-round
advancedment of the cause of socialism with Chinese
characteristics into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Ding Wenchang and Tao Bojun agreed with Du, saying that the
army should at no time waver in subjecting themselves to the
absolute leadership of the Party Central Committee and the Central
Military Commission.
</P>
<P>
Army officers should be selected according to the primary
principle of combining both ethic integrity and political
awareness so as to guarantee that the gun will remain forever in
the hands of those who are loyal to the cause of the Party.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping's thinking on army building during the new
period is an important component of the Deng Xiaooping Theory, said
Shi Yunsheng.
</P>
<P>
Holding high the great banner of the Deng Xiaoping theory means
efforts should be made to implement his thinking on army building
and Jiang's exposition on army building, he added.
</P>
<P>
The delegates said they are determined to follow the decisions
of the Party Central Committee and the Central Military
Commission, and cut the armed forces by 500,000 within the coming
three years.
</P>
<P>
Attention should be paid to building the army through science
and technology, and improving the army's fighting capability to
win local wars under modern technology, especially under
high-technology, and taking the road of fewer but better troops
with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Liu Huaqing, Zhang Zhen, Zhang Wannian abd Chi Haotian, vice
chairmen of the Central Military Commission, attended the panel
discussion.

<HEADLINE> Opening of CPC National Congress Hailed by Mao's Countrymen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- This morning, Mao's
Restaurant in Shaoshanchong Village, central China's Hunan Province,
the native place of late Chinese leader Mao Zedong, was packed
with government officials and villagers.
</P>
<P>
They came not to eat but to watch the live telecast of the
opening of the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) in the capital of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"We could feel the festival mood by sitting together to watch
the opening of the Party Congress," said Mao Weiren, a 27-year man
from the village, where the Chinese leader was born in December
26, 1893.
</P>
<P>
People in Mao's hometown have become well-off: 100 percent of
the families there having TVs -- 60 percent are color -- and the
majority have moved into new houses. Some have even bought their own
cars, according to the young man.
</P>
<P>
Tang Ruiren, the owner of the well-known Mao's Restaurant, told
Xinhua, "Jiang Zemin's report at the congress has soothed us a
lot."
</P>
<P>
She said that a stable national policy would boost her
business. Tang plans to start two branches in other cities soon.
</P>
<P>
While news from the congress is comforting to Mao's countrymen,
it has turned the ethnic minority-dominated Tongdao Dong
Nationality Autonomous County, also in Hunan, into a land of song
and dance.
</P>
<P>
Local officials and ordinary people gathered at Xinzhai Village
in the county to celebrate the opening of the Congress. "My family
has been well-off, thanks to the good policies of the Party," said
Li Benzheng, a villager, whose family used to rely on government
subsidies before the reform began in 1978, but now earns over
20,000 yuan (2,400 US dollars) per year.
</P>
<P>
"Jiang's report at the Congress has made us more confident in
the future," said Yang Zenggang, secretary of the village Party
Branch Committee. "In the next stage, we plan to introduce foreign
funds to open factories manufacturing timber products and pumps."

<HEADLINE> Southern African Climate Outlook Forum Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The five-day Southern African
Regional Climate Outlook Forum ended in Kadoma, central Zimbabwe
today with meteorological and weather experts agreeing the region
is likely to experience below to near normal rainfall this year.
</P>
<P>
The forum which was convened to formulate a consensus guidance
for the coming rainy season in southern Africa was held against a
background of the El Nino phenomenon which is reported to be
growing in the tropical Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
El Nino is the warming of sea waters disrupting rainfall
clouds leading to the unleashing of disasters such as droughts
and floods throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
In the first period, which is October to December, above
normal rainfall is expected to fall.
</P>
<P>
''Even for Zimbabwe, the beginning of the rainy season is
expected to be good,'' Marufu Zinyowera, director of
meteorological services in Zimbabwe told the Zimbabwe News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
''But it is also expected to drastically drop to far below
normal soon after Christmas, so we are advising farmers not to
use long season crops,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is expected to receive a 33 percent of below to near
normal rainfall this season which has been feared to be the
lowest ever.
</P>
<P>
''Although the seasonal onset may be favorable, the
possibility of a later downward trend should be considered. There
are extremes such as the southern tip of South Africa, where
above normal rainfall is expected,'' said Zinyowera.
</P>
<P>
The experts report, however, differs completely with a report
from the center for environmental studies at the University of
Zululand in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The report said Zimbabwe would experience below normal
rainfall by 57 percent in the early summer but was expected to
improve drastically assuring farmers of an above normal season.

<HEADLINE> US Retail Sales Increase for 3rd Straight Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Retail sales in the U.S.
rose by 0.4 percent in August, the third straight increase, the
U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that retail sales totaled a seasonally
adjusted 213.7 billion dollars in the month, up from a revised
212.8 billion in July. The July figure was initially estimated to
be 212.1 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The August increase in retail sales followed larger jumps of
0.7 percent in June and the revised 0.9 percent in July. The
retail sales declined from the March to May which had slowed U.S.
economic growth from a strong 4.9 percent annual rate during the
first quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that all sectors shared in the latest advance
except for food.
</P>
<P>
The increases in U.S. retail sales was led by sales of durable
goods -- items expected to last more than three years. It rose by
0.7 percent after gaining 1.3 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
Automobile sales were up 0.8 percent after a 1.8 percent
increase in July. Excluding autos, retail sales were still up 0.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
Sales of nondurable goods such as food and fuel rose by a
modest 0.2 percent in August after a 0.6 percent gain in the
previous month. But grocery stores reported a 0.2 percent loss in
sales for August, following a 0.4 percent increase in July.
</P>
<P>
Department store sales were up 0.6 percent after a 0.8 percent
increase in July. Gas station sales rose 0.5 percent in August
following a 0.7 percent rise.
</P>
<P>
Most analysts said strong sales alone won't convince the U.S.
Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again when its
policy-maker -- the Open Market Committee -- meets on September
30.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: ALbright's Mediation Gets Nowhere </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The much publicized
mediation efforts by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
between the Israelis and Palestinians concluded today without
making any headway in reviving the stalled Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
An visibly upset Albright, virtually empty-handed in her first
visit to the region after becoming the U.S. top diplomat, did not
conceal her dissatisfaction and disappointment with the failure of
her efforts, which had been so widely expected to bring new hope
to break the prolonged and dangerous deadlock in the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Ramallah today after her second and
last meeting in three days with Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat, ALbright said that only little
progress had been made in her efforts to bring the two sides back
to negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
She was referring to the scheduled meeting in Washington
late this month between two Israeli and Palestinian teams led
by senior aides to Israeli and PNA leaders. Another top
meeting between Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy and PNA
deputy head Mahmoud Abbas (or Abu Mazen) was also planned later
this month in New York during the United Nations General
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"But I do think there is a great deal to be done
here, and I am obviously not satisfied. Big steps are needed
and we will be able to take small ones," she said.
</P>
<P>
To hammer home her message of disappointment, Albright warned
that she was not ready to return to the region unless the
two sides take big steps to proceed. "I am not coming back
to tread water," she said bluntly.
</P>
<P>
Seemingly, the failure of Albright's mediation was attributed
to the stances of intransigency taken by both Israel and
the PNA, which have established respective preconditions for
resuming the peace talks. Israel demanded the PNA launch an
all-out war against terrorism, while the PNA insisted that
Israel should first lift its sanctions and fulfill its
commitments to the signed peace accords.
</P>
<P>
However, the true reason for Albright's failure in resuming
the peace process should be traced back to herself since she
has adopted an apparently biased attitude in favor of Israel
from the start of her mediation here.
</P>
<P>
In her statements made after meeting Israeli President Ezer
Weizman Wednesday right upon her arrival, Albright deliberately
stressed the unique and strategically important relations between
Israel and the U.S., vowing to support Israel economically,
politically and militarily.
</P>
<P>
She also expressed the U.S. unequivocal support to Israel's
demand on the PNA's fighting terrorism, while neglecting the PNA
pleas for more U.S. pressure to lift Israel's unjustified
sanctions and violations of Oslo accords, such as continuing
settlement activities and delaying further troop withdrawal in
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Even Israeli officials, originally bracing for tough U.S.
pressure, were stunned by Albright's warmth and understanding
towards Israel at a time when the world expected the U.S.
to play the role of an impartial mediator to monitor the
implementation of the signed agreements under its auspices.
</P>
<P>
Only until Thursday evening did Albright make a low-key
speech, in which she criticized Israel for taking some
unilateral steps to preempt issues reserved for the final-status
negotiations, including settlement construction, land confiscation
and demolition of Arab houses.
</P>
<P>
Albright's failure was also because she had not succeeded
in securing a freeze, even temporarily, on Israel's settlement
activities. Undoubtedly, the current crisis in the peace process
was caused by Israel's building of the Har Homa settlement
in East Jerusalem in March, and the recent wave of suicide
bombings in Jerusalem have only aggravated the tension.
</P>
<P>
Albright only said that Israel should refrain from taking
unilateral steps to preempt the final negotiations in order
to create a proper environment for the peace process to
blossom.
</P>
<P>
Albright's failure and her threat to stay away from the process
was an ominous sign for the moribund Israeli-Palestinian peace
process, which could slide backwards into the abyss of more
violence and widespread confrontations in the region.

<HEADLINE> EMU Will Cut Dole Queues in Europe, Says Flynn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The European single currency
will help to solve Europe's unemployment problems and cannot be
seen as an "optional extra," Padraig Flynn, the European Union's
social affairs commissioner, has told an annual conference.
</P>
<P>
But he warned that establishing a single currency will not be
enough on its own to safeguard employment and growth across
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the closing session of the Trade Union Congress's
annual congress which ended Thursday, Flynn said he would be
launching a new European social program next year which would draw
up a set of guidelines with boosting employment as its main aim.
</P>
<P>
He made clear that the EU was not planning to use the social
chapter to introduce new laws. There was "no conspiracy and no
hidden agenda" to burden EU countries with new restrictions.
</P>
<P>
But Flynn added, "Let me be clear: if action is necessary, I
will not hesitate to propose the appropriate legislation and to
promote it."
</P>
<P>
He said, "Our objective must be a full economic and monetary
union, with positive coordination of national policies and
objectives, including employment, as well as an appropriate
monetary policy."
</P>
<P>
The problem was that Europe lacked the economic policy
coordination and had 14 separate currencies, he said. So he
insisted that EMU must not be seen as an optional extra.
</P>
<P>
"It is the necessary counterpart to the increasingly integrated
European economy, in which national policies lose much of their
force if exercised alone," Flynn stressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- A festival atmosphere has
pervaded the Chinese nation with today's opening of the 15th
Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in Beijing, a
week-long meeting designed to set the country's development course
for the next century.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin's opening speech drew bursts of applause
from the crowd gathered at the Shougang Steel Complex in Beijing to
watch the live telecast of the opening event.
</P>
<P>
"I am now feeling at ease, after hearing Jiang's report," said
Xie Yuhuan, an employee of the steel company. He said he believes
that the Party Central Committee with Jiang at the core will
continue to hold high Deng Xiaoping's great banner of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
"The Party has become more and more mature," said Li Dongzhi, a
worker at the First Party Congress Site Memorial Hall in Shanghai,
where late Chairman Mao Zedong and 12 of his comrades founded the
Party in 1921.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, just 13 delegates represented the total of 53
Party members when the First Party Congress was held. Now more
than 2,000 delegates are attending the 15th congress, representing
58 million Party members.
</P>
<P>
Today's opening of the congress kept local farmers at home in
Yan'an, in northwest China's Shaanxi Province, where CPC was
headquartered from the late 1930s to the mid-1940s. "After hearing
Comrade Jiang's report, we feel that we will have an even better
future," said Hao Guiren, a local village Party head.
</P>
<P>
According to Hao, local farmers now live in newly-built
cave-houses, have bought large-screen Television sets and
installed direct-dial telephones.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, In Shenzhen, the first special economic zone and a
pilot city for the country's reform, local people said that the
opening of the congress has built up their confidence in the
current reform and opening drive.

"Comrade Jiang's report has established the leading position of
Deng Xiaoping Theory, and we have had a more clear understanding
of the next step of the reform," said Li Yinrong, a local
businessman.
</P>
<P>
Local residents in the city of Wenzhou in east China's Zhejiang
Province, paid utmost attention to Jiang's expositions on the
diverse sectors of economy.
</P>
<P>
"It gives the go-ahead to the growth of the varied economic
sectors and affirmed our efforts to promote these sectors of
economy over the past dozen years," said Xu Guanju, vice-president
of the Zhejiang Provincial Industrial and Commercial Federation,
adding that Wenzhou has drawn nationwide attention for its booming
diversified businesses.
</P>
<P>
This morning in Hohhot, capital of north China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region, local residents and tourists flocked to the
Xinhua Square to watch the live telecasting on huge TV screens.
</P>
<P>
"Comrade Jiang Zemin's report is really encouraging," Baoyin, a
herdsman of Mongol ethnic group, said in broken Han language.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the congress also has aroused strong response in
the outlying, less developed areas.
</P>
<P>
"We fully support the Party's policies," said Liu Changlin, a
village head in Chang'an Town, Fujin City of the northernmost
Heilongjiang Province. He told Xinhua that his villagers are among
the 30 million former poor rural people, mentioned by Comrade
Jiang in his report, who have overcome poverty in the past five
years.
</P>
<P>
After hearing Jiang's speech, officials from industrial bases
like northeast China's Shenyang city and east China's Nanjing felt
much relieved, as they are convinced that the congress will call
for a new round of the restructuring of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"I hold that after the Party Congress, there will a still
better external environment for state-owned firms to reform and
develop," said Zhang Shenghua, deputy Party secretary of the
Nanjing-based Panda Group, a renowned electronics giant in east
China.

<HEADLINE> Greek, Albanian Foreign Ministers Meet in Athens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister
Theodoros Pangalos today held talks with his visiting Albanian
counterpart, Paskal Milo, on ways of expanding cooperation between
the two Balkan countries.
</P>
<P>
They also talked about a European prospect for Albania, the
Balkan summit in Crete in early November and problems in the
Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the one-hour talks, the two men
described their talks as "the most favorable development in
Greek-Albanian relations in recent times," with Pangalos adding
that relations with Tirana were developing "in a most favorable
manner."
</P>
<P>
Pangalos said that a friendship and cooperation agreement
between the two countries would be ratified by the Greek
Parliament by March next year.
</P>
<P>
He also announced a series of measures and initiatives that
would further strengthen ties between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Greek President Costis Stephanopoulos had invited his Albanian
counterpart to visit Athens in early 1998, he said, adding that
the planned visit by Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis to
Albania next month was in the context of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Greece today presented Albania with 2 billion drachmas (about
7.14 million U.S. dollars) as urgent economic aid for the
neighboring country.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos handed the money to Milo after their talks today.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that expert committees of both countries would be
meeting soon to thrash out the details of 18 million drachmas
(about 64,285 U.S. dollars) worth of Greek loans promised to
Albania to aid in the implementation of public works projects in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Milo, who arrived here Thursday for a three-day official visit
to Greece, also met with President Stephanopoulos and Prime
Minister Simitis earlier today.
</P>
<P>
He urged Albanians living in Greece to abide by Greek law and
invited Greek investors who had fled Albania in the wake of the
unrest to go back to the country.

<HEADLINE> Qatar Launches Diplomatic Drive For Doha Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Qatar today launches a
diplomatic drive by sending a senior official to some Arab
countries to drum up support for the Middle East and North Africa
Economic Summit scheduled to be held in Doha in November.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of State For Foreign Affairs Ahmmed Ibin Abdullah
al Mahmoud left Doha today on an official visit to Algeria as part
of this diplomatic move which is also include visits to to some
other Arab states, the Qatari news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Algeria is the first leg of his five-state tour which will
also take him to Mauritania, Sudan, Djibouti and Yemen, the
news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The tour comes a week before an Arab League's meeting on
the fourth Middle East and North Africa Economic Summit which
was strongly opposed by some Arab states due to an expected
Israeli participation.
</P>
<P>
In protest against the deadlock in the Arab-Israeli peace
process, Syria, Lebanon, the Palestinian Authority, the UAE and
Saudi Arabia have decided to boycott the summit.
</P>
<P>
However, most of other Arab states adopt a wait-and-see
stand and await a final decision by the Arab League at the
meeting in Cairo on September 20 to 21.
</P>
<P>
Qatar remained determined to host the summit as scheduled
on November 16 to 18 despite the pressures. Qatari officials
said earlier this week that it is going ahead with
preparations for the summit and invitations would be sent out
at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
The previous three conferences were held in Casablanca, Amman
and Cairo and attended by Arab states, Israel and their major
trade partners in the industrialized world.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- It is possible for Angola to
achieve last peace, visiting Portuguese Secretary of State for
Foreign Affairs and Cooperation Jose Lamego said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to newsmen after talks with Angolan President Dos
Santos, Lamego said although the tempo of peace process falls far
behind of expectations, the realization of lasting peace is
possible so long as all sides have good wishes, constraints and a
clear attitude toward peace.
</P>
<P>
It is crucial for the last two weeks of September to the peace
process as concrete tasks should be fulfilled then and at that
time the United Nations would decide whether to impose sanctions
against the opposition UNITA movement.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped peace process would make headway in this
period and alleviation and dialogue would reign so that all
Angolans would work for the realization of national unity and
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Lamego arrived here Thursday to get acquainted with the peace
process in a bid to get to know the attitude of the two sides so
as to promote the peace process. Portuguese is one of the
monitoring countries for the process.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian PM Calls for Arab Solidarity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister
Abdul-Salam El-Majali urged the Arab states to put aside their
differences and work to ensure solidarity among them for the
benefit of their peoples.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference today at the end of his three-day state
visit to Sudan, El-Majali warned that "there are some quarters that
exploit the differences among the Arabs to destroy them."
</P>
<P>
He called on Arabs to shelve their differences for at least
five years during which cooperative relations should be developed
among them.
</P>
<P>
El-Majali made his trip to Arab states including Bahrain,
Qatar, Oman, Yemen, Egypt and Sudan, in a bid to revive the Arab
solidarity.
</P>
<P>
During his visit here, the Sudanese and the Jordanian sides
issued a joint communique underlining the necessity of cooperation
and they formed an ad hoc committee of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Jordan said its backs Sudan and supports the Khartoum peace
accord that was signed by the Sudanese government and six rebel
factions from South Sudan last April.
</P>
<P>
The two sides reviewed the situation in the Arab region and the
latest developments in the Arab-Israeli peace process. They voiced
concern over the dangers threatening the peace process, the
communique said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides underscored the necessity of establishing just,
comprehensive and lasting peace in the region under the
resolutions of the U.N. Security Council and General Assembly to
ensure the return Arab legitimate rights.
</P>
<P>
They also highlighted the importance of the principles and
references on which the Middle East peace process was based and
the necessity of full implementation of what had been agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
Sudan and Jordan expressed deep concern over the sufferings of
the Iraqi and Libyan peoples due to the unjust embargoes. They
urged lifting of the sanctions imposed on the two peoples and
stopping the mass-sanction policy.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Government Demonstrations Continue in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's conservative
Islamists today continued their so-called Friday demonstrations
to protest the newly adopted eight-year compulsory education
law, local media reports said.
</P>
<P>
Around 1,000 protesters gathered outside the Beyazit Mosque
in Istanbul, the largest city of Turkey, following their Friday
prayer services, shouting anti-government slogans.
</P>
<P>
They demanded the revision of the education law which was
adopted in the Parliament last month and the continuous
operation of religious schools.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators clashed with security police who tried to
block the parade, causing injuries on both sides.
</P>
<P>
In the capital city of Ankara, a group of conservative
Islamists staged a demonstration near the Bayrampasa
Mosque. Police detained 13 people, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrations have taken place every Friday after Muslim
prayer services since the education law took effect last month.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry has warned that those people staging
Friday demonstrations against the new education law will face
arrests and other punishment.
</P>
<P>
The education program launched by the Turkish government with
the support of the military is aimed at curbing the rapidly
growing fundamentalism in the secular Muslim country.
</P>
<P>
The law demands that students finish eight years of compulsory
education before they are permitted to start religious study,
leading to the closure of many religious schools.

<HEADLINE>   Albright Still Uncertain to Visit Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister
Farez Boueiz today denied that he had any information about the
visit of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to
Lebanon, Lebanese official National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the minister did not like to talk more
about the possibility of Albright's visit.
</P>
<P>
But the report quoted an official at the Lebanese Foreign
Ministry as saying that Albright's visit to Lebanon will depend
on the outcome of her talks with Syrian leaders.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Al-Hariri, who is in France on a
two-visit, have said that if Albright decides to visit Lebanon,
he will interrupt his visit and return home.
</P>
<P>
The official said on condition of anonymity that if Albright
only focuses on Israeli security and presses Palestinians to
eradicate terrorism instead of making a full and comprehensive
peace in the region, it will be better for her not to visit
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He added that the stance of Lebanon and Syria toward peace
talks is known and clear. That is peace for security, not the
opposite way.
</P>
<P>
Until now, Israel has not been prepared to enter the peace
talks track. It is trying to extort Palestinians and Arabs, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon, a major party in the Middle East peace talks, is not
officially included in the U.S. secretary's maiden visit to the
region, which has taken her to Israel, Palestinian self-rule
areas and Syria, and will take her to Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
But Lebanese press reports conjectured that Albright will
make a sudden visit to Lebanon Friday or Saturday.

<HEADLINE> UK's Enterprise Oil Tries to Meet Production Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Enterprise Oil, the UK's
largest independent explorer, tries to meet its ambitious
production targets despite lower output and few new discoveries in
the first half of 1997, according to The Financial Times today.
</P>
<P>
The company aims to produce an average of 320,000 barrels of
oil equivalent per day in 1999, up from 229,935 in the six months
to June 30.
</P>
<P>
Analysts estimate exploration discoveries, mainly from the Gulf
of Mexico, are about 20 million barrels so far this year, out of a
total of 80-100 million that might be expected for the full year.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Andrew Shilston, finance director, as saying,
"Investment would be higher in the second half as several large
projects got under way."
</P>
<P>
Development of Jotun, in which Enterprise holds 42.5 percent,
will cost about 240 million pounds (384 million US dollars) over
two years, making it the company's biggest single capital
investment commitment after Nelson in the North Sea.
</P>
<P>
Capital expenditure for the full year was put at 520 million
pounds (832 million US dollars), after a total of 180 million
pounds (288 million US dollars) in the first half.
</P>
<P>
Shilston said, "What we have been doing is something like
laying down vintages to drink in 10 years' time."
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted production had been lower than expected
owing to maintenance problems in the North Sea that had been
resolved.

<HEADLINE> UK Literacy Standards Lag Far Behind Industrial Rivals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Britain ranks second from the
bottom in a league table of literacy covering eight industrialized
countries, according to an international survey published today by
the Office for National Statistics.
</P>
<P>
The survey, based on a random sample of 3,800 British people
aged 16 to 65, found that more British adults are struggling at
the lowest literacy level than their counterparts in any other
developed country surveyed, except Poland.
</P>
<P>
It revealed that 22 percent, equivalent to around 8.4 million
in the population as a whole, could not make an accurate
comparison of two pieces of written information or work out simple
sums.
</P>
<P>
More than half the British population had literacy skills below
the standard generally agreed as the minimum necessary to cope
with the demands of modern life.
</P>
<P>
The survey also confirmed past findings that literacy skills
were poorer among those with lower levels of education and among
people who were out of work or in lower-skilled occupations.
</P>
<P>
Across the age ranges, those over 45 were more likely to have
worse literacy standards than the younger groups but there was
little difference between those aged 16-45, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
David Blunkett, the education and employment secretary, said
the results showed "there has been an unacceptable neglect of
literacy standards for too long." He also promised a white paper
on lifelong learning before the end of the year.

ANKARA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Turkish police seized a total
of 207 kilograms of heroin in two operations in eastern and
southern Turkey, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency said
today.
</P>
<P>
Police raided a house in a village in eastern province of
Van, seizing 32 kilograms of pure heroin.
</P>
<P>
Another 175 kilograms of heroin were seized in an operation in
the Mediterranean province of Mersin.
</P>
<P>
Five people were arrested in the two anti-narcotics raids,
police officials were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the agency failed to report when the raids were
carried out.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has long been known as an important route for
trafficking drugs into the European markets from Asia.
</P>
<P>
However, the volume of the drugs seized by police dropped
significantly because of a change in the smuggling routes in
Turkey, police said.

<HEADLINE> Solana Reassures NATO Support for Bosnian Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- NATO chief Javier Solana
today reassured the international community and the Bosnians that
the Stabilization Force (SFOR) is fully ready to ensure a
problem-free municipal election in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival on the eve of the elections, Solana told the press
that his presence in Sarajevo was to underscore NATO's support for
the elections which he described as an important milestone in
implementing the Dayton peace accord.
</P>
<P>
A NATO press release quoted Solana as saying, "The SFOR is
fully ready to prevent any difficulties during the elections. The
SFOR also stands ready to take firm action against the media whose
output is in persistent and blatant contradiction of either the
spirit or the letter of the Dayton peace agreement."
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief arrived in Bosnia after the alliance-led SFOR
was reinforced with more troops and equipped with more F-16
fighter jets and policing tools such as batons, shields, tear
gases and non-lethal grenades.
</P>
<P>
Solana told the press that the SFOR had been temporarily
reinforced by six battalions and the SFOR strength now stood at
nearly 40,000.
</P>
<P>
"These soldiers will ensure that the municipal elections are
held in a secure environment," the NATO chief said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2,500 international observers are also in
Bosnia-Herzegovina to oversee the two-day elections to be held in
the 16 municipalities in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that Bosnian Croats had dropped their
threat to boycott the elections. In the past two weeks, both the
Bosnian Croats, led by the HDZ, and the Bosnian Serbs under the
leadership of the Pale-based SDS had been threatening to stay
away.

LUANDA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of businessmen
and entrepreneurs from the United States has concluded its
successful visit to Angola, the US ambassador Edmound Djarnet
said here today.
</P>
<P>
This is the biggest delegation of US businessmen which has

relations in May, 1993, said Djarnet, who is also head of the
US-Angolan Chamber of Industry and Commerce.
</P>
<P>
The visit from September 8-11 was aimed at reaching agreements
on investment with Angolan businesses and government departments
and setting up primary contacts between businesses of the two

between the businessmen of the two countries and expanding
investment in Angola will become brighter with final peace in
Angola.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Nominates Surgeon General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton today nominated Dr. David Satcher, director of the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to the long-empty post
of surgeon general.
</P>
<P>
This is Clinton's third attempt to fill the post vacated in
1994 by the controversial Dr. Joycelyn Elders.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also named Satcher assistant secretary of health.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said Satcher's most important public-health mission
would be "to free our children from the grip of tobacco."
</P>
<P>
Vice President Al Gore said Clinton was "nominating a surgeon
general who will be a true field commander in the war against
underage smoking."
</P>
<P>
The White House said it went to extraordinary steps to ensure a
smooth confirmation. "To avoid any of the controversy we've
experienced in the past, there was a very extensive and lengthy
vetting process," said spokesman Mike McCurry.
</P>
<P>
"We have consulted closely (on Capitol Hill) to take some
temperature readings," he said. "We are expecting a very
enthusiastic and favorable response."
</P>
<P>
Satcher, 56, has served as CDC director since 1993. He was
president of Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee, for
10 years and was chairman of the community medicine and family
practice department at Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
The nomination would put Satcher on the path to a job that has
seemed star-crossed since Clinton took office in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Elders, Clinton's first surgeon general, left in December 1994.
The nomination of her successor, Dr. Henry Foster, failed to win
Senate approval. The acting surgeon general, Dr. Audrey Manley,
left office on July 1.
</P>
<P>
The son of a foundry worker, Satcher was raised in a large
family on a farm outside Anniston, Alabama.
</P>
<P>
He graduated in 1963 from Morehouse College, and became the
first black student to earn simultaneously a medical and doctoral
degree at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland in 1970.
</P>
<P>
Satcher began his medical career in Los Angeles at the Martin
Luther King Jr. Medical Center, where he developed the family
medicine department and directed the sickle-cell anemia program.

<P>
DAMASCUS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright left here this evening after a lightening
visit, on the fourth leg of her Middle East tour.
</P>
<P>
Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad received and had four-hour
talks with the visiting U.S. top diplomat on the latest
developments in the region particularly the possibility of
resuming the Syrian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>

Al-Shara, Syrian Ambassador to the United States Walid Al-Muallem,
the U.S. special envoy to the Middle East peace process Dennis
Ross and the U.S. Ambassador to Syria Christopher Ross.
</P>
<P>
Albright's visit to Syria was aimed as seeking an opportunity for
resuming the Syrian-Israel peace process since Damascus voiced
satisfaction at the remarks made by Albright on August 6 in the
U.S. Press Club in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Albright had said the land-for-peace principle and the two
U.N. Security Council resolutions 242 and 338 are the basis of the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian official daily "Al-Thawrah" expressed hope today
that Albright's visit would yield positive results and make a
breakthrough for the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
Albright left here for Alexandria, Egypt, where she will brief
the Egyptian leaders of her visit to Israel, Palestinian self-rule
areas and Syria. She is scheduled to visit Jordan and Saudi Arabia
after her short stay in Egypt.

<HEADLINE> IDB Backs Debt Reduction for Bolivia under HIPC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 12 (Xinhua) --The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) today announced its support for the
international debt-reduction for Bolivia in the framework of
assisting heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC).
</P>
<P>
The Bank's Committee of the Board of Governors, meeting here
this week endorsed a decision of its Board of Executive Directors
to participate in the reduction of Bolivia's debt to ensure debt
sustainability at a 225 percent debt-to-export ratio.
</P>
<P>
The IDB will provide relief in the amount of 155 million U.S.
dollars in present value, or about 260 million dollars in nominal
terms, equivalent to almost 35 percent of the relief to be
provided by all of Bolivia's creditors and more than one half of
the amount for multilateral institutions.
</P>
<P>
The IDB's portion is nearly three times greater than the
next-largest amount provided by a single institution.
</P>
<P>
IDB President Enrique V. Iglesias praised the "spirit of
solidarity" among the 46 member countries of the Bank in their
decision to join the initiative.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which
are jointly launched the HIPC initiative last year, also approved
debt relief for Bolivia earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Bolivia will become the first Latin American country to receive
debt relief under the HIPC program. It is expected to gain access
to the benefits of debt relief within a year.

an objective description of China's reforms and opening-up and
compare China with Russia in economic restructuring.
</P>
<P>
China has made important strides in opening-up, and the opening
of the panel discussion in the current Party congress is an
important symbol of China's all-round opening-up, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I have no reporting mission today, but only to gain insights
of the 15th Party congress," said Hugo Restall, editorial page
writer from Asian Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
The discussion of Shanghai delegation was just as attractive as
that of Beijing delegation. The only difference was the discussion
by Shanghai delegation started 15 minutes earlier at the request
of 100-plus Chinese and overseas reporters.
</P>
<P>
Speakers from the Shanghai delegation ranged from Shanghai
mayors to bank president, chairman of the board of directors. A
Hong Kong reporter commented the panel discussion by Shanghai
delegates was fairly informative and transparent. The speech by
Shanghai mayor quoted 50 latest figures to support his points, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The positive response from the overseas press was an annotation
for a talk by Wang Zheren, director of the 15th Party Congress
Press Center: "To open panel discussions is to give the press an
opportunity to know the conference proceeding and what's happening
in China."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The opening of the 15th
National Congress of Communist Party of China (CPC) on Friday
brought enthusiastic and favorable response from the rank and file
of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and the People's Armed
Police (PAP).
</P>
<P>
All PLA and PAP officers and men, whether in their barracks,
patroling the borders, or involved in outdoor training, watched
with close attention live telecast of the opening of the Party
Congress Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
After hearing the work report delivered by Comrade Jiang Zemin,
many PLA and PAP officers and men expressed their firm desire to
closely unite around the CPC Central Committee with Jiang at the
core and to continue upholding the great banner of Deng Xiaoping
Theory.
</P>
<P>
The building of the armed forces must be reinforced so as to
safeguard the national security and the current modernization
drive, they pledged.
</P>
<P>
Policemen stationed in the former residence of late Chairman
Mao Zedong in the city of Shaoshan in Central-south China's Hunan
Province, armymen of the Chengdu Military Area Command in the
hometown of Deng Xiaoping in southwest China's Sichuan Province,
and officers and men of the 12th Company of a regiment of the PLA
Beijing Garrison patroling the Chang'an Avenue shared the same
following views:
</P>
<P>
"Comrade Jiang's report, taking Marxism, Mao Zedong Thought and
Deng Xiaoping Theory as the guidance, has confirmed the principal
guidelines of the Party in the primary stage of socialism and set
forth the great goal to realize the all-round national
rejuvenation and the complete reunification of the motherland, and
it has reflected the common aspiration of the whole Party, the
whole Army, and the people throughout China."

<P>
Moreover, troops stationed in special economic zones, namely
Hainan province, and the coastal cities of Shenzhen, Zhuhai,
Shantou and Xiamen in south and east China, discussed Comrade
Jiang's report, held that without the CPC and Mao Zedong Thought,
there would never have been a socialist New China. While without
Deng Xiaoping Theory, the country's present-day prosperity would
have been impossible.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, all headquarters in the central level and in major
command areas celebrated the opening of the Party Congress in
varied ways.
</P>
<P>
Many high-ranking PLA and PAP officers regarded Jiang's report
as a great guiding document as it provides a complete, in-depth
and scientific definition of the Party's most important theories,
guidelines and policies.
</P>
<P>
"The report has put forward new and still higher requirements
for the building of the defense sector and the Army, and it has
made a significant strategic decision to step up the improvement
of quality of the Army," they were unanimous in this view.
</P>
<P>
The officers pledged that all the armed forces will hold high
the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory, adhere to the principle
of the Party's absolute leadership over the Army, and rally still
more closely round the Party Central Committee and the Central
Military Commission, both with Jiang Zemin at the core.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, they pledged to abide by and absolutely accept the
command and leadership of the Party Central Committtee and the
Central Military Commission.

<HEADLINE> Hot Topics Among Delegates to Party Congress (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Holding high the great banner
of Deng Xiaoping Theory has been the topic highlighting all panel
discussions of delegates to the on-going 15th National Congress of
the Communist Party of China here over the past few days.
</P>
<P>
The delegates hold that it is timely to stress the issue of
banner at the turn of the century. Holding high the great banner
of Deng Xiaoping Theory is the fundamental guarantee for China's
reform and opening up.
</P>
<P>
Wang Tianxi, deputy secretary of the Yunnan Provincial Party
Committee, said a country with 56 ethnic groups and a population
of 1.2 billion must have a banner which can unite the people,
chart direction and blaze a new trail on its way to the 21st
century. And this is Deng Xiaoping Theory.
</P>
<P>
Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, said
the theme and the soul of the current congress is to hold high the
great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory. The CPC has long been
attaching great importance to the guidance of theory.
</P>
<P>
In the past, she said, "we rely on Mao Zedong Thought to
overthrow imperialism, feudalism and bureaucrat-capitalism to
build a new China. Today we rely on Deng Xiaoping Theory to carry
out reform and open to the outside world, which has helped to
improve the productive forces of China, raise the overall strength
of the national economy and improve the people's living standards.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's report has made breakthroughs in many areas of
theoretical research, indicating that the Communist Party is
mature, she added.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Peiyan, vice-minister of the State Planning Commission,
said the report was characterized by the following three features:
establishing the Deng Xiaoping Theory into the Party Constitution;
summerizing work in all trades theoretically and urging the people
to emancipate the mind.
</P>
<P>
The achievements made since China's reform and opening up in
the late 1970s have proved that the principle of taking economic
development as the central task of China set forth by Deng
Xiaoping was correct, he added.
</P>
<P>
Xu Kuangdi, a delegate from Shanghai, China's largest
industrial center, said Deng Xiaoping Theory is a beacon lighting
China to build socialism with Chinese characteristics and carry it
on to the next century. It is a major contribution to the
international communist movement.
</P>
<P>
Many delegates are in favor of the proposal of the Central
Committee to place Deng Xiaoping Theory into the Party
Constitution as its guiding ideology.
</P>
<P>
Chen Huanyou, Party committee secretary of Jiangsu Province,
said the report has been imbued with the spirit of emancipating
the mind and seeking truth from facts, answered a great number of
issues in China's reform and worked out programs for cross-century
development in China.

<HEADLINE> Open Discussions in Party Congress Attract Overseas Press (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua)-- Although there were still 30
minutes before the panel discussion began this afternoon, the
Beijing Conference Hall at the Great Hall of the People, venue of
the discussion for Beijing delegates, was packed with more than
100 Chinese and overseas reporters.
</P>
<P>
As there were only 46 seats reserved for the press, many
reporters remained standing out of the line separating delegates
from the press.
</P>
<P>
"Although it's tiring, we are closer to the congress delegates
and we can hear them more clearly," said an AFP reporter.
</P>
<P>
Mics, cassette recorders were seen piling before the
loudspeaker at the corner of the conference room. More than ten
video cameras and photo cameras were clicking in the conference
room.
</P>
<P>
According to conference regulations, the congress opened six
panel discussions today to overseas reporters. As it's the first
time to open such discussions to the overseas press, it is hailed
by the foreign press as an "unprecedented opening move".
</P>
<P>
The discussions of Shaanxi, Shandong, Inner Mongolia, Beijing,
Shanghai and Jiangsu delegations open today attracted the
attention of reporters from Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and the
foreign press, with those of Beijing and Shanghai catching the most
attention.
</P>
<P>
"Beijing is the capital city of China and there are many hot
spots," said a reporter from the Hong Kong Economic Guide.
</P>
<P>
The reporter attended the opening session of the congress
yesterday morning and rushed to the press conference given by
large state firms in the afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Delegate of China's Last Hunting Ethnic Group Shows up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- "I am the head of the
Autonomous Banner of Oroqen nationality, the last hunting ethnic
group in China," hardly had the stocky Meng Songlin begun to
introduce himself than all reporters rose to their feet and turned
their cameras at him.
</P>
<P>
A banner is an administrative division of county level.
</P>
<P>
"As descendant of a hunter, I feel excited that I could come to
Beijing as a delegate to the Party congress and listen to Comrade
Jiang Zemin's report," said the 42-year-old Meng in a panel
discussion in the Great Hall of the People today, which was open
for the first time to the journalists from Hong Kong, Macao and
Taiwan as well as foreign journalists covering the congress.
</P>
<P>
"He pointed out in his report that only the Party could lead
the Chinese people toward national independence and a happy life,"
said Meng. "I shall give my hearty agreement in this regard."
</P>
<P>
Before 1949, when the new China was founded, the Oroqen people
had lived as hunters in the primitive forests of Inner Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
"At that time, the Oroqen lived by hunting on horsebacks and
ate by campfire. My father was born on a hill slope, and I had
been living among hunters dressed in roe deer-skin clothings until
I went to primary school at 12," said Meng.
</P>
<P>
The Oroqen Autunomous Banner was founded in 1951. Seven years
later, all Oroqen settled down, thanks to money allocation from
the central government with which they built houses in their new
settlement. Its population so far has reached 2,031, compared with
a number of something over 700 in 1949.
</P>
<P>
"The founding of new China has brought prosperity to an ethnic
group once on the brink of extinction," said Meng.
</P>
<P>
Meng went on that the Oroqen is undergoing a transformation in
its mode of production. "We are now pursuing a broad variety of
production instead of solely hunting," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Meng, hunting can no longer provide an ample life
to his people.
</P>
<P>
"What's more, people in China and from abroad are calling for
protection of wildlife on which we live," added Meng. "That's why
we issued a ban on hunting in January of last year.
</P>
<P>
After two years of persuasion and explanation, the remaining
218 households, or 744 hunters, were finally talked into unloading
their hunting guns which they had carried all their life, and
joining others to take up farming tools.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Oroqen started a diversified economy with
farming as the main occupation.
</P>
<P>
In the Oroqen Autonomous Banner, which is half as large as
Zhejiang province, 85 farms have been set up. Annual income per
capita in the banner topped 1,736 yuan last year, approximately
600 yuan more than that prior to the ban on hunting was
implemented.
</P>
<P>
With aid from the government, every household in the banner now
has access to electricity power and has cable TVs fixed up. "Some
of the families even own telephones," Meng told the reporters.
"Moreover, the government offers tuition fees for all children
from primary schools through colleges."
</P>
<P>
Meng added that his banner would devote to non-pollution
industry for the benefit of ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
"Despite our population size, we do not want to be left the
poorest," he said, fully convinced that the Oroqen will strive to
become among the most wealthy in China under the guidance of the
great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investors Show Rising Interest in Xiamen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Overseas investors have
exhibited their rising interest in investing in Xiamen in east
China's Fujian province, with agreements signed so far for 62
projects at the ongoing '97 China Investment and Trade Talks.
</P>
<P>
Su Shuili, vice-mayor of Xiamen, said at a press conference
held here today that the new agreements involve a total of 1.13
billion US dollars of investment, including more than one billion
US dollars of foreign funding.
</P>
<P>
"Of the projects, 30 each involve an investment of 10 million
US dollars or more, one even with 150 million US
dollars," Su said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 62 projects are related to the chemical,
electronics, power and machine-building industries. Su predicted
that some will require the most advanced technology and equipment,
which will promote the city's development.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan investors have signed 24 projects with companies in
Xiamen, covering agriculture, industry, tourism, real estate and
infrastructure construction. "This is the first time that Taiwan
investment has exceeded that from Hong Kong," added the official.
</P>
<P>
European and American businessmen also set their sights on
Xiamen's markets, signing eight agreements involving 127 million
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Su also said that a group of import-export contracts worth of
340 million US dollars has been signed during the ongoing talks, a
rise of 10.52 percent over last year.

<HEADLINE> Rhee In-je Announces Bid for South Korean Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Rhee In-je, governor of Kyonggi
Province, formally declared Saturday that he would run on his own
the coming presidential election while bolting from the ruling New
Korea Party (NKP).
</P>
<P>
The 49-year-old governor also vowed to bring young politicians
to the fore in politics as the first step to advance a "revolution
in politics" if elected.
</P>
<P>
Rhee's unexpected bid for the presidency is expected to affect
greatly the ongoing four-side presidential race, which seemed to
be heading toward a showdown between the NKP and the main
opposition National Congress for New Politics (NCNP).
</P>
<P>
The ruling party fears Rhee's decision will split its candidate
Lee Hoi-chang's vote and ultimately help the front-runner,
opposition NCNP's Kim Dae-jung win the election.
</P>
<P>
The latest opinion polls show Rhee and Lee are behind Kim, who
is in the fourth bid for the presidency at his 70s.
</P>
<P>
The NKP's high officials said President Kim Young-sam expressed
disappointment at Rhee's decision, but party sources say only a
few party members will follow Rhee, given that party lawmakers of
Rhee's supporters opposed his presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
Rhee's jump into the presidential race slated for December 18
had been forecast since his resignation from the governorship last
Monday, which was a precondition for the candidacy.
</P>
<P>
Rhee lost the ruling party's presidential candidacy to Chairman
Lee Hoi-chang in the party's nomination contest in July.
</P>
<P>
But Rhee's continued high popularity and candidate Lee's
unexpectedly weak show in the early stages of the presidential
race made it difficult for the loser to give up his presidential
ambition.
</P>
<P>
Born in Nonsan, South Chungchong Province, Rhee was a two-term
lawmaker until being elected governor of the populous province in
local elections in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer-turned politician, a close associate of President
Kim, served as the first Labor Minister under the Kim Young-sam
government.

<HEADLINE> China Opposes Random Adjustments to UN Assessment Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Any revision or
adjustment to the UN assessment rates should be based on the
principle of ability to pay, a Chinese representative to the
United Nations said today.
</P>
<P>
The representative, who asked not to be identified, made the
remark in a response to reports that the United States had asked
China to increase its UN assessment rates to more than 4 percent,
and China was considering the U.S. proposal.
</P>
<P>
The representative said China did not object to making
appropriate revision or adjustment to the UN assessment rates, but
any revision or adjustment should be based on the principle of
ability to pay.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Russian Oil Industry Improving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Russia gained a 0.7-percent
increase in oil output in the first eight months of 1997, Russian
First Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov said today.
</P>
<P>
At an oil industry meeting, Nemtsov, who is visiting the
Khanty-Mansiisk ethnic autonomous region of Siberia, said that
three large oil companies -- LUKoil, Surgutneftegas and Rosneft --
have the incremental output.
</P>
<P>
He said the government should pursue partnerships with oil
companies, which contribute 20 percent of taxes to the federal
budgetary revenue and heed the interests of the state and the
companies.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the government would soon discuss the issue
of car import tax duties.
</P>
<P>
First Deputy Minister for Fuel and Energy Viktor Ott said that
Russia's oil and gas output in the January-August period of this
year has reached 203 million metric tons, or 3.8 million tons,
higher than expected.
</P>
<P>
However, Ott said Russia's oil industry remains to have
difficulties with one in every three refineries working at a loss
and the number of idle oil wells accounting for 25 percent of the
total.
</P>
<P>
He cited a serious decline in this year's pace of oil
extraction, saying about 55 percent of the country's oil fields so
far have been difficult to pump.
</P>
<P>
The highest oil output is in the Tyumen region, Siberia. It
accounts for more than 43 percent of the total.

<HEADLINE> FM: Iran Gives Priority to Ties with Neighbors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran's foreign policy has
given priority to relations with neighboring countries and the
Persian Gulf littoral states, Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said
here today.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with his Qatari counterpart Sheikh Hamad Ben
Jassem Ben Jaber al-Thani, Kharrazi said Iran will build mutual
confidence and create a friedly climate with the neighboring
countries, adding that "it is necessary to expand cooperation and
solidarity."
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that the Gulf plays a vital role in meeting the
world's energy needs, noting that Iran, as a Gulf littoral country
which has the largest coastal areas, plays an important role in
this strategic region.
</P>
<P>
"To regulate relations on a realistic basis, attention should
be paid to the role Iran can play in establishing peace and
tranquility in the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister said that Muslim states should
have close relations in order to safeguard their people's
interests under current circumstances.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari foreign minister, who arrived here last night,
stressed that his country regards Iran as a powerful friend in the
region and wants to expand and strengthen relations with it.
</P>
<P>
He said that furthering relations between the two countries is
a step toward a more secure region and will be beneficial to all
regional countries.
</P>
<P>
"Qatar believes in having strong relations with Iran and wants
to expand mutual ties in political, economic and commercial
areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
He was to deliver a massage from Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Ben
Khalifa al-Thani to Iranian President Mohammad Khatami. No detail
of the message is available.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at Tehran's Mehrabad Airport, he said that
Qatar's ties with its neighbors, Iran in particular, are clear
and solid.
</P>
<P>
He said that in his meetings with Iranian officials he intends
to become familiar with Tehran's views and also discuss further
expansion of Tehran-Doha ties.

<HEADLINE> Ownership Form and Democracy Should Accord With National Condition, Says Theorist (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking of the political restructuring, Xing said, "the
socialist democracy in China should be achieved by means of
ruling the country by law."
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the National People's Congress and its
Standing Committee have formulated, under the leadership of the
CPC, a series of laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
"However," he said, "the achievement of socialist democracy
hinges on whether or not everything is handled according to laws."
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin said in his report that the socialist country
should be ruled by law, and this deals with an important link in
developing the socialist democracy, an important link in political
restructuring, he said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the importance of ruling the country by law requires
the practice that all are equal before the law, he said. "All the
activities of the Communist Party of China should proceed within
the scope of the Constitution and laws of China," he said.
</P>
<P>
"China will draw on the good experience of the Western
democracy but will not copy the Western democracy, such as the
two-chamber system and multi-party electoral race," he stressed.
adding that every country has its own national conditions.
</P>
<P>
The socialist democracy in China has developed through a long
period of time. The Chinese Communist Party has accumulated rich
experience in establishing and improving the political
consultative system of multi-party cooperation under the
leadership of the CPC, he said.
</P>
<P>
The democracy is progressing in China. To date, the direct
election at village and township levels is spreading in the
country, winning praise from abroad, he said.
</P>
<P>
China's economy and culture were backward in the past and
people's education is not high. And the development of democracy
requires a process. With the gradual deepening of the country's
economic reform, socialist democracy in China will be further
improved, he said.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Takes Measures to Ease Traffic Jams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital needs
more subways, belt highways and special bus lanes on city streets
to deal with its grim traffic situation, Beijing's Assistant Mayor
Zhen Yijun has said here recently.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's road network is overloaded by more than one
million motor vehicles -- a number that increases by about 15
percent a year, Zhen said.
</P>
<P>
Traffic studies show that during peak traffic times, the
average speed of vehicles on main roads in the urban areas is
below 20 kilometers an hour.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the city has only 544 public parking lots which can
accommodate 32,000 cars. He said the city needs more parking lots
with an accommodating capacity of at least 50,000 cars.
</P>
<P>
To ease road congestion, Beijing is speeding up construction of
some key transport facilities, he said.
</P>
<P>
The subway from Fuxingmen to Bawangfen, currently under
construction, is expected to be put into use in 1999. Preparations
are being made for the construction of the No. 5 subway from
Songjiazhuang in the south to Beiyuan in the north and the Xiyi
subway from Xizhimen to the Summer Palace.
</P>
<P>
Beijing expects to re-distribute 70 to 80 percent of its
traffic volume to underground.
</P>
<P>
A 65-km belt highway, the fourth one in Beijing, will be built
by stages and three traffic lanes for special buses are to be
opened this year, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Beijing is planning to control the amount of motor vehicles to
reduce the pressure on its road network, according to Zhen.
</P>
<P>
Traffic control is to be aided by modern technology;
closed-circuit TV monitoring systems will soon be installed to
regulate two belt highways, he added.
</P>
<P>
Traffic jams decreased in Beijing after the city took some
traffic control measures. The congestion in 15 of the 99 seriously
blocked sections has been eased.

<HEADLINE> Diverse Forms of Public Ownership to Promote Economic Growth, Li Peng (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Concerning the issue of joint stock partnership, Li Peng said
China should manage well state-owned large enterprises while
adopting a flexible policy toward small ones. There are many
methods to deal with small enterprises in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Experience accumulated in these years shows the introduction of
joint stock partnership is an effective way, Li said. In most
cases, workers in enterprises which practice joint stock
partnership buy stock to share risks of the enterprises, and
therefore have stronger sense of responsibility.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, by issuing shares the enterprises will have
more funds, with which they can repay their loans and finally
extricate themselves from the burden of repaying interests.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Li said, the enterprises could carry on
technological transformation and development with the funds so
that their staying power would be further strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Through the introduction of such partnership, quite a few
enterprises have reduced losses and increased profits. Management
in these enterprises have been improved as well, Li noted.
</P>
<P>
To sum up, the joint stock partnership has been proved through
practice to be an effective way of managing well large enterprises
and adopting a flexible policy toward small ones, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng also called for down-to-earth work in carrying out the
partnership, saying that the criterion for judging the success is
"three favorables" -- favorable to promoting the growth of the
productive forces in a socialist society, increasing the overall
strength of the socialist state and raising the people's living
standards.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that everything should be done in accordance with
reality. Hasty and arbitrary quotas should be avoided, he added.
Work in this regard should be done according to the law of the
market economy, and be gradually standardized.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng said that banking is playing an increasingly important
role in the national economy. Financial reform should be carried
out in accordance with the reality of the country. The economic
structure should be further adjusted through reform. A prudent
attitude should be adopted toward the opening of the capital
market.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng said that China should draw a lesson from the financial
crises that took place in Mexico and recently in southeast Asian
countries. The quality of financial capital should be improved,
financial supervision and management intensified, financial crisis
prevented and financial reform accelerated, He said.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng pointed out that the private sector of the economy
plays an important role in many areas, especially in the
handicraft and retail trades.
</P>
<P>
He said the private sector has provided a large number of job
opportunities and has more rooms to develop in the service trade.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng expressed his belief that diversified forms of public
ownership will surely help consolidate and develop the public
sector of the economy, thus promoting China's all-round economic
growth.

<HEADLINE> EU Finance Ministers Meet to Discuss Taxation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONDORF LES BAINS, Luxembourg, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The EU
finance ministers today started discussion on a global approach to
taxation as a run-up to the convergence for the European single
currency.
</P>
<P>
The informal meeting was the first opportunity since April last
year for the finance ministers to develop cooperation at EU level
on taxation policy and on measures to curtail harmful tax
competition in the single market.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, held at the Luxembourg town on the border with
France, was presided over by the Luxembourg presidency, which has
made taxation one of its two main priorities during its six-month
tenure.
</P>
<P>
The finance ministers last met in April 1996 at Verona, Italy,
and a consensus has emerged since then on the key challenges to
taxation policies in the 15-nation union.
</P>
<P>
They felt there was an urgent need to implement concrete
measures to combat harmful tax competition and agreed that such an
approach was the most promising route to follow.
</P>
<P>
Though EU-level decision is not expected, the informal meeting
will delve into discussions on general policy orientations by
demonstrating their respective initial reactions and their
individual components.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive agency of the union,
will come forward with a more developed taxation package as the
basis on which the ministers will seek significant progress at
their formal meeting in December this year.
</P>
<P>
The ministers agreed that globalization presents new
opportunities for national economies but blows up the risks of
harmful tax competition.
</P>
<P>
Electronic commerce, which makes the physical location of
activities much less significant, may increase the potential
impact of tax differentials on business decisions and may
aggravate the risk of harmful tax competition, tax avoidance and
tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
Tax competition is an important factor in the shift in the tax
burden to the less mobile tax base of labor. Given the
considerable differences in mobility between different sectors of
the labor market, the trend is for the burden of taxation to shift
increasingly to the least skilled and less mobile employees.
</P>
<P>
Highly skilled employees and professionals are increasingly
mobile and responsive to tax differentials.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will also deal with the topic of the exchange
rates for the single currency which is to be launched on January
1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
They are expected to examine the scope for defining criteria
for fixing exchange rates for currencies participating in the
final stage of the economic and monetary union (EMU) in relation
to the future single currency.
</P>
<P>
The Maastricht Treaty, signed in 1992, proposed that the
European Council should set up an exchange rate system between the
euro and non-EU currencies, and make general recommendations for
an exchange rate policy between the single currency and non-EU
currencies.
</P>
<P>
Yves-Thibault de Silguy, European commissioner in charge of
economic and monetary affairs, is expected to encourage member
states at the meeting to work out their respective measures for
the run-up to the inauguration of the single currency.
</P>
<P>
Up till now, Belgium, Luxembourg, Ireland, Finland, Italy and
the Netherlands have worked out such national programs for
changing over to the euro.

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls for Efforts to Settle Afghan Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi today called on neighboring countries to exchange views
and continue efforts to put an end to the bloodshed in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi made the appeal at a meeting with visiting Pakistani
Deputy Foreign Minister Rafat Mahdi, whose mission was to
coordinate efforts for the coming Tehran summit in December of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC).
</P>
<P>
Iran and Pakistan pledged support to the warring factions in
Afghanistan. Iran suffered a big blow when Kabul fell last
September into the hands of Taliban militia, which Tehran accused
was armed and supported by Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Taliban has already controlled about 90 percent of the
territory of Afghanistan. Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani, who
was supported by Tehran, fled before Taliban's advance into the
capital.
</P>
<P>
During today's talks, Kharrazi termed the trend of
Tehran-Islamabad ties as "good" and called for further exchange
of views and experiences in an effort to explore fresh avenues for
further expansion of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mahdi said here today that Iran had always been
sensitive to regional developments and played a positive and
effective role in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif visited Tehran in June
but failed to reach agreement with the Iranian side on a
settlement of the Afghan crisis.

<P>
ROME, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Italy, France and Belgium will
issue a joint statement early next month urging the European Union
(EU) to accelerate its reform programs.
</P>
<P>
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini made the announcement at
a joint news conference with his visiting French counterpart
Hubert Vedrine after their meeting.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine, who arrived here today, said that both France and
Italy need a strong Europe, which will only come as a result of EU
reforms.
</P>
<P>
The reforms should be carried out in the size, the mandate and
the voting system of the European Commission, the EU's executive
agency, he added.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, the two ministers also discussed a wide
range of international issues and reached agreement on almost all
of them.
</P>
<P>
On the Middle East peace process, Dini said the recent trip by
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to the region had
failed to meet many people's expectations.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine agreed with Dini and added that the Middle East peace
talks were still at a dead-end alley.

<HEADLINE> Ownership Form and Democracy Should Accord With National Conditions, Says Theorist (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The emphasis of the economic
restructuring is to solve the understanding of the whole Party on
the form of ownership as pointed out in Jiang Zemin's report at
the opening session of the 15th National Party Congress, a
theorist said here today.
</P>
<P>
"On the basis of the improved understanding, the state will
make a strategic reorganization of existing state-owned
enterprises," said Xing Bensi, vice president of the Party School
of the Central Committee of Communist Party of China (CPC) and
editor-in-chief of "Seeking Truth", a theoretical magazine of te
CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
It is a "misunderstanding" to regard the readjustment and
improvement of ownership mentioned in Jiang's report simply as a
question of shareholding system, he stressed in an exclusive
interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"The public ownership is not equal to the state ownership," he
pointed out, explaining that the public sector includes not only
the state sector but also collective sector, and the collective
sector is also the public sector, and the state- and
collectively-owned elements in the sector of mixed ownership also
belong to the public sector.
</P>
<P>
The definition about the public ownership is based on an
analysis of various elements and therefore it is a "scientific
conclusion," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the course of a strategic reorganization of existing
state-owned enterprises, he said, the state would firmly control
the trades which have a vital bearing on the national economy and
some especially important economic interests, such as
communications and transport, banking, finance and some major
natural resources, while letting the state- and collectively-owned
firms or the mixed ownership to manage those less important
trades.
</P>
<P>
"This strategic reorganization is of great significance," he
said, adding that "this is actually to put the limited state
financial strength in the sectors that have a vital bearing on the
national economy. This seems that the investment line is short,
but actually it is an advance, not retrogression, and it is to let
the large enterprises which weigh heavily with the national
economy really develop."
</P>
<P>
Xing Bensi pointed out that reports saying that China will
sell off most of the state enterprises and only keep the small
number of large enterprises are "groundless." "It is impossible
for China to do so, and such a method will not work and only
leads to chaos," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The report has raised the development of diversed
forms of ownerships with the public ownership in the dominant
position to a height of a basic socialist economic system.
</P>
<P>
Xing said that the reason why the Chinese Communist Party has
set forth this development policy is because China's productive
forces are still low and the mono-public ownership would be unable
to promote the development of productive forces, and what is more,
it will may undermine their development.
</P>
<P>
The aim of allowing and encouraging a diversified form of
materializing the public ownership is to find a form of public
ownership which can help develop the productive forces to the
greatest possible extent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Xing said: "Practice has proved that it is wrong to think
that 'greater scale the public ownership, the better.' It
requires very earnest efforts to push up our economy and there
is not any short-cut."

<P>
PARIS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Police Investigating the auto
accident which resulted in the death of Diana, Princess of Wales,
are examining the wreckage of the Mercedes S-280 sedan in which
she and three others were traveling.
</P>
<P>
Police have not excluded the possibility of a collision between
the car and another vehicle at the entry of the Alma tunnel.
</P>
<P>
The car will be completely "boned" and studied piece by piece

<P>
Investigators want to know the origin of a suspicious "scratch"

<P>
Police have found debris from a red rear auto light near the
shattered debris of headlights apparently from the Mercedes S-280,
the Paris-based daily Aujourd'hui said today.
</P>
<P>
All the vehicles and motorcycles of the photographers under
inquiry have been checked by police, but none of them showed any
indication of a clash with another vehicle, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The evening paper, France Soir, said police took a photo of the
Mercedes S-280 sedan with an automatic radar supervisor, while the
car was speeding past the Alma Bridge.
</P>
<P>
The photo, which caught the car registration number and clearly
showed Henri Paul, the chauffeur, at the wheel, was classified by
police, the paper quoted a leader of a police union as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, police denied having a picture of the car on its route
from the Hotel Ritz to the Alma underground tunnel where the fatal
crash occurred.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, a former lover of Henri Paul denied
today that the chauffeur from the Ritz Hotel was suffering from
depression or was a drunkard.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with le Figaro, Laurence P., who lived with
Paul from 1990 to 1995, said that Paul never took anti-depression
pills, nor drank alone.
</P>
<P>
But she said that the last time she contacted him was on the
phone in July 1996.
</P>
<P>
The London-based Daily Mirror said today that Paul took to
drinking after Laurence and another girl friend of his abandoned
him this summer.
</P>
<P>
"He drank until six o'clock in the morning in a bar near his
home," Vincent Martin, a taxi driver who knew Paul, told the paper.
</P>
<P>
A third toxicological test of Paul's body confirmed two
previous test results that he had imbibed three times as much as
the legally allowed volume of alcohol on the day the accident took
place.
</P>
<P>
A French judge issued a permit Friday for the burial of Paul's
body.

<HEADLINE> Hainan Maintains Stable Public Security Order (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The island province of Hainan
in south China, the country's largest special economic zone, has
maintained stable public order in recent years -- a great
improvement from its previous record.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, the number of its criminal cases has
been on a steady decline from 1990 to 1993, and the ratio has been
kept within eight crimes per every 10,000 residents in the past
three years.
</P>
<P>
The number of criminal cases registered in the first half of
this year has dropped by 27.9 percent over the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Hainan province was designated a special economic zone by the
central government in 1988, which drew in 100,000 people from all
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The frequent flow of people and assets have contributed to the
worsening of the public security, which hit an all-time low in
1989, when the number of criminal cases reached 9,000, nearly
double the number before the province was established.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has intensified its fight against
crime by setting up responsibility systems at all government
levels. Meanwhile, it also has increased financial input into the
public security organs.
</P>
<P>
During the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1990-1995) period alone, the
provincial government allocated more than 79 million yuan (9.5
million US dollars) to streamline the public security apparatus.
</P>
<P>
In-depth studies have been conducted by the public security
organs since 1992 to determine the key problems and areas. The
provincial capital, Haikou, were regarded as a hot-bed of criminal
activity where more than 40 percent of the crimes occurred.

The police force's efficiency has also been upgraded, thanks to
the establishment of the police alarm systems covering the whole
province and nearby sea areas, which were the first of the kind
set up in China.
</P>
<P>
Various training courses have been held for the police,
covering practices to be followed during emergencies. The ratio of
police who have received college-level education has risen from
13.9 percent to 30 percent, ranking first in the country.
</P>
<P>
With the reinforcing of the police force and the improvement of
their facilities, great progress has been scored in the public
security field in Hainan over recent years. The number of fights
involving weapons has also been eliminated.
</P>
<P>
Theft of latex from rubber trees, used to make rubber products,
had been a major annoyance for the island's farmers, with over
1,400 cases occurring each year. The number has dropped to dozens
each year since 1995, and the production of rubber has reached the
record in history.
</P>
<P>
The gun-related cases has also dropped significantly.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the public security bureaus have solved more than
15,000 criminal cases involving pornography and gambling since the
establishment of the special economic zone.
</P>
<P>
There have been no bank robberies in the province since April
1995, whereas before then, bank heists were all-too-common on
Hainan. Meanwhile, no serious criminal cases have occurred its
rural areas, which make up 80 percent of the island's total area.

<HEADLINE> Postal Rates to Be Reduced in Zambia's Rural </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Postal Services
intends to reduce postal rates in rural areas to enable the rural
community to communicate.
</P>
<P>
Public Relations Manager Francis Mumba said the plan, which
has been endorsed by the board has reached an advanced stage and
will be implemented soon.
</P>
<P>
He said after critically examining the problems facing the
people in rural areas the corporation has decided to reduce its
rates in order to accommodate them.
</P>
<P>
Mumba said because of the high rates people in rural areas
have stopped writing letters.
</P>
<P>
"In view of the current general decline of the economy in the
country which has forced many people to choose between letter
writing or buying food, many opt for the latter," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mumba said as part of the diversification program the postal
services, in conjunction with the state lottery of Zambia, will
start selling Pick-A-Ticket at its offices in some parts of the
country from next week.
</P>
<P>
he said since the corporation has the largest retail outlets
in the country, Zambia Postal Services has entered into an
agreement with the state lottery to sell its Pick-A-Ticket at a
commission.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Romanian President Emil
Constantinescu returned to Bucharest this afternoon after a
five-day state visit to China, which he defined as "a complete
success."
</P>
<P>
The visit has yielded satisfactory results, the travel-worn and
weary president told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The visit to China shows that only through labor and honesty
can a country achieve progress and development, which is a feature
of modern China, Constantinescu said.
</P>
<P>
China has not only a glorious history but also a bright future,
Constantinescu said.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Romanian relations are characterized by mutual trust and
consultation, which will continue to be the principle for the
future development of relations between the two countries, the
president said.
</P>
<P>
Constantinescu added that he had a sincere and frank talk with
Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
Romania finalized its diplomatic strategy for the present and
for the 21st century as a result of his visit to China,
Constantinescu said.
</P>
<P>
While the integration into the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) and the European Union remains a focal point
in the Romanian foreign policy, Romania will strive to further
develop ties with the Asian-Pacific region, especially with China,
the president said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Visits Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President
Fidel Ramos arrived here today for a two-day visit and received a
red-carpet welcome accorded by Kuwaiti Amir Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmed
al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that a Philippine president visits
Kuwait. During his stay here, Ramos is expected to hold talks with
Kuwaiti leaders to on ways of promoting bilateral relations, and
on regional and international issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
The two countries will sign an agreement on cultural
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The visit of Ramos, who is accompanied by a large group of
businessmen, is expected to strengthen bilateral ties and offer
opportunities of trade and investment for both sides, effectively
reversing the declining trend in bilateral trade over the past
years.
</P>
<P>
Last year, their trade volume slid to 34 million
U.S. dollars, with an annual decrease of 32 percent from 202.4
million dollars in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait hosts hundreds of thousands of Filipino laborers. The
Philippines announced Friday to lift a ban to allow the processing
of "qualified workers applying as household workers" for Kuwait
and Saudi Arabia, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos will meet with the Filipino community at a downtown
hotel on the eve of his departure for Prague, the Czech Republic
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ramos' visit to Kuwait fulfills his economic mission to all
the six states of the Gulf Cooperation Council, whose other
members are Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain
and Oman, and concludes cooperation agreements in culture and
tourism with them.
</P>
<P>
Ramos, who is on a four-nation tour, had just ended his visit
to Russia and will continue his trip to the Czech Republic and
Austria.

<HEADLINE> WFP Aid Worker Kidnapped in Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 13 (Xinhua) -- A local aid worker for an
international organization has been abducted by unidentified
gunmen in south Mogadishu on Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The aid worker, Idiris Mohaqmed Osman, head of the World Food
Program (WFP) office in Mogadishu, was surrounded by five to six
armed men driving a land cruiser as he walked out of a Muse Boqor
Mosque after his Friday prayers.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitness said the gunmen have ordered Osman to enter the
land cruiser before driving him away to an unknown destination
without hurting him. The reason for the kidnap is still unknown.
</P>
<P>
However, friends of the abducted aid worker told reporters
that they heard previous job and contract quarrels between Osman
and other Somalis who are suspected to have masterminded the
kidnap.
</P>
<P>
So far, the fate of Osman is not known and there has no
demands yet made by the abductors despite the continuation of
mediation efforts for his safe release.
</P>
<P>
The kidnap took place only two days after South Mogadishu
faction leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid met with a high-level
delegation from the United Nations agencies serving in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The delegation led by Dominick Langen Bacher, head of United
Nations Development Program (UNDP) who is in charge of all U.N.
agencies operating in Somalia, discussed with Hussein Aidid about
the humanitarian situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the headquarters of Hussein Aidid said the
meeting mainly focused on relief operations and the security of
aid workers.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. delegation also met with the North Mogadishu faction
leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed, at the natural port of El-Ma'an, 30 km
north of the city for the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Somali aid worker serving the French aid agency
Action Contra Le Faime (ACF), was released late Friday night in
North Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The aid worker, Sheikh Omar Aw-dhegle, was released unhurt
after serious efforts were exerted by elders and intellectuals in
the area. Aw-dhegle was abducted by Somali gunmen on Thursday. No
ransom was paid for his release, according to friends close to
Aw-dhegle.
</P>
<P>
The security situation in both sides of the war-torn capital
has deteriorated in the past few weeks as free-lance gunmen are
carrying out actions of killing, looting and abduction of
civilians for mainly fortune-seeking purposes.
</P>
<P>
Faction leaders have warned that all such gunmen will be dealt
with accordingly, but so far no concrete measures have been
taken.

<P>
BEIRUT, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese Foreign Ministry
today warned of a scam which has extracted 5 billion U.S. dollars
from unsuspecting victims worldwide.
</P>
<P>
An influx of faxes from Nigeria to Lebanese businessmen
promising easy money prompted the ministry advisory, Beirut's
newspaper the Daily Star reported today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that the faxes or letters have arrived
marked "urgent and confidential," many on letterheads bearing the
insignia of the "Government of Nigeria," asking for assistance in
circumventing Nigeria's tight foreign exchange laws by
transferring money using foreign accounts.
</P>
<P>
If the recipient accepts, he or she is asked for an account
number, as well as "advance fees, transfer taxes or performance
bonds."
</P>
<P>
After the initial payment, the Foreign Ministry said,
complications arise and the Nigerian party normally requests more
money.
</P>
<P>
Several Lebanese have been asked "to transfer money again and
again until the sum reached 500,000 U.S. dollars," the ministry
added.

<HEADLINE> Iranians Jubilant Over 4-2 Victory over China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of shopkeepers who
watched their TV screens at downtown rose to scream and jump in
the air as Iranian soccer team scored its last goal in a 4-2
victory over China in a World Cup Asian zone qualifier in the
Chinese port city of Dalian today.
</P>
<P>
"We are very happy. This will surely pave the way for our team
to advance to the 1998 World Cup finals in France," said a textile
shop owner named Mostafa Dadkhah.
</P>
<P>
He told about 20 other shopkeepers to be his guest, and ordered
ice cream and soda to celebrate Iran's come-from-behind victory
over China.
</P>
<P>
Iran, who played the away game in group a, trailed 1-0 in the
first half and conceded the second goal one minute after the
break. But the Iranians soared back devastatingly, blasting four
goals in a row to seal a brilliant victory.
</P>
<P>
Aside from celebration and the jubilant mood, most Iranians
believed that despite a passive first half, the Iranian team was
able to turn the tide in the second.
</P>
<P>
"In the first half we thought that our team was not in good
form, but by the end of the game, when we saw how tired the
Chinese were, we realized that our strategy was to make the
Chinese tired first, so we could create chances to beat them in
the second half," a university student Ja'far Baqeri said.
</P>
<P>
Another Iranian sport fan said that although before this game
he did not think high of the Iranian head coach Mohammad Mayelee
Kohan, but now he believes that the man can lead Iran to gain
bigger victories.
</P>
<P>
Rahim Rezabeik, a construction engineer, said:"Mr. Kohan showed
 that he was an excellent coach. He sent up Ali Modier-Rousta to
the field at the right time, and his decision of pulling out
Khodadad Azizi in the second half proved a wise move."
</P>
<P>
Most Iranians interviewed after the game said that the Chinese
made mistakes by just following Iran's star strikers such as Ali
Dayee, Azizi and Karim Baqeri, but forgetting other players.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Says Albright's Efforts Encouraging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the regional Doha Economic Summit scheduled for November,
Mubarak said Egypt's participation hinges on progress made on the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
A number of Arab countries have threatened to boycott the
conference in protest against Israeli hardline Mideast policy
which has been blamed for the stalemate of the peace process. And
the U.S., a strong advocate of the regional economic cooperation
forum, however, insists that it should go as planned.
</P>
<P>
Albright stressed the conference would be a chance for the
Mideast to be part of global economy and a favor for all people in
the region. "It is valuable in its own rights," she added.
</P>
<P>
Today's talks were also attended by Egyptian Foreign Minister
Amr Moussa, Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri, Mubarak's Political
Advisor Osama el-Baz as well as U.S. Mideast Peace Coordinator
Dennis Ross and U.S. Ambassador Edward Walker.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who arrived here late last night, held a session of
talks with Moussa at breakfast this morning before seeing Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
After three days of talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and PNA President Yasser Arafat, Albright admitted
failure to break the confidence crisis between them, saying she
would not come back to "tread water" in the near future until
"they made hard decisions."
</P>
<P>
In what she called small steps towards a resumption of the
peace talks, the U.S. and the Palestinians have agreed to set up a
joint committee to monitor the PNA's efforts to combat terrorism,
according to Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
Albright said earlier, Israeli and Palestinian diplomats will
meet in Washington and New York in the coming two weeks in a bid
to revive the peace process that came to a halt in March after
Israel began to build new homes for Jews in East Jerusalem the
Palestinians claimed as their future capital.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian officials said on condition of anonymity that Ross
will return to the region in the coming weeks to follow up
Albright's visit.
</P>
<P>
The peace crisis worsened after a wave of suicide bombings hit
Jerusalem in the past five weeks, killing more than 20 people and
wounding over 300.

<HEADLINE> Italy Blames Israel for Middle East Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini said today that Israel's unilateral action which
runs against the peace accords caused the stagnation in the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Dini said in an interview published today that both Israel and
the Palestine Autonomous Authorities are responsible for the
crisis in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Terrorist activities should be stopped, but this is not the
only problem, he said.
</P>
<P>
Dini said that certain forces in the region have been trying to
deter the peace process, arousing anger and disappointments.
</P>
<P>
He said that terrorist acts and stalled peace talks were the
fruits of Israel's unilateral action which runs against the peace
accord and leads to revolts.
</P>
<P>
The way of the revolts should be condemned, but it is the
resistance by the Palestinians against the establishment of Jewish
settlements and other similar activities by Israel, Dini said.
</P>
<P>
He said that new proposals are needed to promote the peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Secretary Madeleine Albright has taken an unbiased
position in her current visit to the Middle East, Dini said.

<HEADLINE> Cooperative Medical Service Resumed in Rural Hainan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Cooperative medical service
has made a comeback in the countryside of the island province of
Hainan, so far covering 30 percent of its rural
population.
</P>
<P>
The system was first introduced onto the island, located at the
southernmost tip of China, in the 1970s, but was suspended in the
late 1980s. With the vigorous support of the Chinese government in
recent years, Hainan farmers are once again joining in cooperative
medical service.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, cooperative medical service was
established in 76 villages across the province benefiting more
than 100,000 local residents.
</P>
<P>
Under the system, every participant pays an amount of between
10 and 40 yuan (1.2 to 4.8 US dollars) annually to the village or
township medical fund, which is also subsidized by local
governments. Then, the medical fund will reimburse 30-50 percent
of his or her medical expenses.
</P>
<P>
Cooperative medical service, based on individual as well as
public funding and voluntary participation, is regarded as the
most reasonable and effective way of ensuring adequate medical
care for farmers, said Lu Qing, director of the Provincial Health
Department.
</P>
<P>
He added that Hainan aims to have 85 percent of its rural
population covered by cooperative medical service by 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
Rome, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Italy and France intend to work
together on all leading international issues, Italian Foreign
Minister Lamberto Dini said Friday after his talks with French
Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a joint press conference, both Dini and Vedrine
accentuated the positive factors in bilateral relations and their
common intention to pursue "concrete actions" on European and
international problems.
</P>
<P>
Dini also announced that in addition to signing the new
European Union (EU) Treaty in October in Amsterdam, capital of the
Netherlands, Italy, France and Belgium will present a joint
statement urging their EU partners to tackle problems involving
institutional reforms that were left out of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine said that Italy will be among the first group of EU
members adopting the euro, the European single currency.
</P>
<P>
Both sides shared a strong consensus on the Middle
East. Vedrine said the peace process had run into a "dead end" and
Dini showed the same disappointment over the stalemate of the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Europe's future, the two stressed the need to
reinforce the Union on an institutional level and to introduce a
common foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Their discussion on other international issues, Dini told
reporters, centered on the reconstruction of Albania and Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> Mali's Premier Steps Down to Solve Political </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Mali's cabinet headed by
Premier Ibrahim Boubacar Keita have resigned in an attempt to
solve a political crisis resulted from the second multi-party
national elections this year.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here today from Bamako, capital of Mali said,
the news was made known by President Alpha Oumar Konare Friday
when he was meeting with the country's political parties.
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting were representatives of the Opposition
Alliance comprising 18 parties, which boycotted this year's
presidential and parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Keita is chairman of Konare's Alliance for Democracy in Mali
(ADEMA) which emerged victorious in parliamentary elections in
July and August.
</P>
<P>
The crisis has been a blow to Mali's image as a model
democracy after a successful transition from dictatorship in
1992.
</P>
<P>
Konare has been trying to build up his bases for a coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties have demanded the premier's departure
as a prerequisite although their priority is given to fresh
elections besides setting free 10 opposition leaders who had been
under arrest since August 10.
</P>
<P>
The 10 who are accused of inciting violence and causing
unrest, have been held responsible for the death of a policeman
as unrest broke out at an opposition rally in Mali's capital of
Bamako.
</P>
<P>
Keita stepped down in June after Konare's re-election but was
named to lead a government until after the parliamentary
elections.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Says Albright's Efforts Encouraging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALEXANDRIA, EGYPT, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak said here today the outcome of U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright's first peace-saving trip to the Mideast
is promising and encouraging.
</P>
<P>
Albright's trip gives hope to the peace process, Mubarak told
a press conference held after a two-hour meeting with her.
</P>
<P>
All the statements she made on the trip which started three
days ago and the announcements by the U.S. State Department are
"balancing, encouraging and promising," Mubarak told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"After that (her trip), I think the peace process will be
easier to pursue," he added.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said he expects continuing discussions and
coordination among the Palestinians, Israelis and Americans to
move forward as far as possible the Mideast peace process until it
reaches a just and comprehensive settlement.
</P>
<P>
Albright, on her first trip to the region since taking office
in January, said she is encouraged by the willingness of the
leaders of the parties concerned to push forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"I was impressed by their yearning for peace...The Mideast is
sick of bombs," she said, before wrapping up the fourth leg of the
trip which has taken her to Israel, the Palestinian self-rule
areas and Syria.
</P>
<P>
She said it's high time for the people of the region to
concentrate on building dignity, security and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Asked on whether Israel's demand for security has been
overblown and the Palestinian security need ignored, the
secretary of state reiterated the importance of mutual
responsibility and commitment to peace.
</P>
<P>
"I made it clear that for peace to go forward, both sides have
to fulfill their mutual responsibility and obligation," she said,
adding that "terrorism should not dominate the scene of the
region."
</P>
<P>
While warning against any unilateral decisions that may
aggravate the situation, she urged Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) to exert 100 percent effort to combat terrorism, which is
"the enemy of peace, both for the Israelis and Palestinians."
</P>
<P>
Praising the enormous role in the Mideast by Egypt which she
called a "strategic partner," Albright said Cairo and Washington
have a share of mutual interest in curbing new threats to security
in the region and easing tensions should they occur.
</P>
<P>
Both Egypt and the U.S. believe a permanent settlement should
be a just and comprehensive peace for the Palestinians and
Israelis, in line with the Madrid, Oslo agreements and the
land-for-peace principle, she added.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Seizes 516 Kilograms of Uranium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has seized up to 516.56
kilograms of poor-grade uranium from smugglers or innocent holders
since October 1993, said a senior Vietnamese official.
</P>
<P>
Nguyen Tien Nguyen, director of the eight-member Vietnam Atomic
Energy Commission (VAEC) said Friday that his committee has also
confiscated 268.65 kilograms of another substance first believed
to uranium.
</P>
<P>
Laboratory testing found that this substance was depleted
uranium, solid waste discharged in the process of enriching
uranium which has no economic value and cannot be used for making
atomic energy, Nguyen said.
</P>
<P>
He added that not a fraction of the dangerous u238 type has
been seized in the country so far.
</P>
<P>
The committee was formed years ago following international
concern that Vietnam was becoming a new venue for an international
black market trade for the uranium (u235) used for nuclear energy
production.
</P>
<P>
The AVEC director said that all the 65 confiscated objects
containing depleted uranium 235 were believed to have come the
United States as many of them bear the imprint "Made In USA."
</P>
<P>
They were possibly retrieved from U.S. aircraft downed in the
war which ended 22 years ago, he said.

<HEADLINE> Kiya's Double Helps Iran Beat China 4-2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, Northeast China, September 13 (Xinhua) -- A second-half
double from Mehdi Mahdavi Kiya inspired Iran to a come-from-behind 4-2
victory over China in the Group A match in the second round of the
World Cup Asian soccer qualifying competition here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
China led the first half 1-0 through defender Fan Zhiyi, who
converted a penalty kick after Zhang Enhua was fouled in the area
two minute before the break.
</P>
<P>
The hosts made it 2-0 nine minutes into the second half, when
full-back Sun Jihai beat the Iranian defence with a fine run down the
left and then passed the ball to Li Ming to slot home with a
spectacular volley.
</P>
<P>
The visitors then came back strongly by grabbing their first two
goals in a span of only seven minutes.
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Karim Bagheri, who is with Arminia Bielefeld in the
German Bundesliga, capitalised a penalty for Iran after Fan fouled on
world's top international scorer Ali Daei in the 60th minute.
</P>
<P>
Iran then levelled the score in the 67th minute, when Kiya dribbled
the ball down the right and shot home calmly in a small angle.
</P>
<P>
Kiya, 20, then blasted home a sudden long-distance ball in the
84rd minutes to put Iran ahead.
</P>
<P>
The Iranians sealed their away victory through Aliaskhar Modir
Rousta, who hit the goal with four minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
"We came here expecting to win by three goals," said Iranian
national coach Mohammad Mayeli Kohan after the game.
</P>
<P>
"China played quite well but we had more chances in the second
half," he added.
</P>
<P>
Kohan said the Iranian eleven made rapid improvement since last
year's Asian Cup, where they finished third, and Saturday's results
proved this.
</P>
<P>
Chinese coach Qi Wusheng said: "It was all too heartbreaking that
we squandered the 2-0 lead to lose. We played the second half poorly."
</P>
<P>
He said, "We appeared to lose our tactical direction after leading
by two goals. Our players need to hone their skills. They should
better both their personal technics and psychological strength."
</P>
<P>
The two teams will clash again in Tehran on October 17, when Iran
plays as the host.

<HEADLINE> More, Better Toilets Built in Rural Areas (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- A Xinhua reporter recently
visited toilets in a number of villages in south China to see the
effect of changes on the lives of farmers, who, for thousands of
years, have found relief in nothing more than a shallow pit.
</P>
<P>
In the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, farmers of ethnic
Zhuang group now have three types of toilets for rural
conditions: "the double-urn", the "little thriple-check", and the
"triple-union methane-producer".
</P>
<P>
"Rural residents are trying to change their image of paying
little attention to hygiene," said 57-year-old woman of Longlou
village in Fusui town, named Huang Chang'e, when she was taking
visitors on a tour of the toilet in her house.
</P>
<P>
"It really gives us a lot of convenience," Huang said, praising
the toilet at home, "We had to find some deserted spot up on the
hillside whenever we wanted to go to the bathroom and it was a real
nightmare for anyone with diarrhoea. But now those embarrassing
things never happen."
</P>
<P>
And, the family is going to build another toilet with a
methane-producing system, she pointed out grinned, showing a pile
of bricks and three pits in the front yard.
</P>
<P>
From there, the reporter went on to find more
examples. Villagers were busy moving in bricks, ceramic tile, and
other construction materials for different kinds of sanitary
toilets everywhere, toiling away enthusiastically, as if their
lives depended on it.
</P>
<P>
The 31 families in Shuangjia village have flush toilets in
bathrooms at home with ceramic tile walls and floors. And they're
rightly proud of these achievements. Explains one, "First,
convenience; second, cleanliness; third, organic fertilizer for
crops."
</P>
<P>
Now that villagers earn an average of 3,000 yuan (375 US
dollars) yearly it's not so difficult to build an 800-yuan toilet.
</P>
<P>
And, the toilet revolution may even help rural people earn more
money, because, in the past, the major problem faced by investors
from other parts of China, not to mention overseas, was finding a
good toilet, "So they lost interest in investing in our hometown,"
says one villager, Deng Xianfa, dejectedly.

<HEADLINE> Delay in Euro Launch Dangerous to All, Says Chirac </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
said in the latest issue of the German weekly "Focus" that a delay
in the launching of the European single currency, the euro, will
be dangerous for all.
</P>
<P>
"There is a date and it should be respected. Otherwise we risk
burying the single currency," said Chirac in an interview with
"Focus" which was published today.
</P>
<P>
He said that a delay of euro will bring "very serious
consequences" to the market of exchange and the economy of many
countries, as well as "a deeper undermining than one can imagine"
of the European monetary union.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also stressed that the criteria set by the Maastricht
treaty for joining the euro should be respected, and that he
"shares exactly the same language" with German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl in respect of the date and criteria for the euro.
</P>
<P>
"The French government, formed from the former (left)
opposition, has decided to respect the criteria because this is in
the interests of France and Europe," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
He added that the euro should be strong so that it can promote
growth and jobs.

<P>
"Putting toilets in houses shows the emancipation of the mind
and a change in thinking," explains a village cadre, who notes
that many farmers used to be superstitious about building a toilet
in the home because it would bring bad luck. But now the toilet
craze in Guangxi is even attracting people from elsewhere who are
interested in getting some construction experience.
</P>
<P>
Wang Guoqing, the secretary of the Party Committee of Qujiu
Town, a town in another part of Guangxi, said, "We brought a
12-member-team here with the goal of learning how to build a
civilized village and protect the environment."
</P>
<P>
A 1992 autonomous regional Patriotic Hygiene Committee study of
25,163 rural families in the region, which has the largest ethnic
minority population in China, showed that 72.6 percent of them had
toilets. But only five percent met sanitary standards, so officials
concluded that greater efforts were required in renovating them if
the rural economy was to improve.
</P>
<P>
And regional and county government regard the construction of
hygiene facilities as one of the major criteria of the quality of
officials' work in villages.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous regional government has spent some seven million
yuan in past two years on sanitary toilets like the double-urn or
methane-producer in rural households. The county government is
offering an enamel basin and three bags of cement to farmers who
will build the toilet themselves.
</P>
<P>
"The regional government will continue this revolution in rural
lifestyle to help reach the country's goal for the year 2000 of 80
per cent of rural families having sanitary toilets," said Xie
Ping, deputy director of the local Patriotic Hygiene Committee.

<HEADLINE> One Quarter S. Africans to be HIV Positive in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The AIDS epidemic in
South Africa would peak in the year 2005 when 25 percent of
adults would be HIV positive, Southern Life's AIDS Unit predicted
at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar, Janin Slawski, head of the unit, said
"AIDS will have its greatest impact on the 30-40 age group. The
sharp increase in deaths in this age group will cause the
national mortality rate to multiply five or six times."
</P>
<P>
Between a quarter and one third of children born to
HIV-positive mothers would be infected, she said, adding that
many babies would be infected by breast feeding.
</P>
<P>
"The community, government and non-governmental organizations
will have to work together to ensure a humane approach toward
AIDS children is developed," Slawski urged.
</P>
<P>
According to Slawski, South African Law Commission had put
forward a draft national policy on HIV and AIDS in schools. It
proposed that compulsory HIV testing for school applicants was
not justified, but recognized that special measures had to be
taken.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Military Urges Continuous Crackdown on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The powerful Turkish military
has reiterated that the government and the armed forces should
make joint efforts to combat the quickly expanding fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Turkish Daily News today quoted senior
military officials as saying that the Muslim fundamentalism still
constitutes a threat to Turkey's secularism and democracy.
</P>
<P>
These officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that
the military will continue to support the current coalition
government in their fight against fundamentalists.
</P>
<P>
They also turned down the rumors that army generals have cast
doubt over the Mesut Yilmaz administration's determination to
fight fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
The military had harshly criticized former Prime Minister
Necmettin Erbakan for his reluctance to take tough measures
against the extreme Islamists, but we don't have the same
complaint with the present government, a senior general told the
paper.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish media reported that the Turkish General Staff
regularly submits to the government reports on the country's
fundamentalism situation.
</P>
<P>
This shows that the Turkish armed forces are helping the the
government to fight the radical Islamists, and it is different
from the criticism of the former Erbakan government, newspapers
commented.
</P>
<P>
Military officials confirmed that the West Working Group,
organized by the General Staff to collect information on the
fundamentalism, will continue to cooperate with the government in
this respect.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish military, which calls itself a guarantor of
Turkey's secularism, played a leading role in forcing the June 19
stepping down of Turkey's first pro-Islamic Erbakan.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- "Ours is an armed force
under the absolute leadership of the Party," Liu Huaqing said
here today.
</P>
<P>
"All officers and men must conscientiously safeguard the great
banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory, implement to the letter the

line for the primary stage of socialism for a hundred years," the
military leader said in a panel discussion attended by delegates

principle in army building, which should be adhered at any
time, he added.

staunch and mature leading collective. We should bear in mind the
entrust of Deng Xiaoping and safeguard the authoritativeness of

Central Committee ideologically, politically and in actions, obey

modernization drive in China," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's report at the opening session of the 15th National
Party Congress is a programmatic document guiding the whole Party,
the whole army and people across China to march under the correct
line set at the Third Plenum of the 11th Party Central Committee,
Liu said.
</P>
<P>
"The great banner of Deng Xiaoping is the one for the whole
party, the whole people and also for the whole army," he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Diverse Forms of Public Ownership to Promote Economic Growth, Li Peng (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The affirmation that any
forms of public ownership should be used to serve socialism as
made by the on-going 15th National Congress of the Communist Party
of China will surely promote China's economic development, said Li
Peng here today.
</P>
<P>
Joining Beijing delegates in a panel discussion this morning,
Li Peng said the theme of the current Party congress is to hold
high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory for an all-round
advancement of the cause of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics to the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He said the Party decided at its Seventh Congress to take Mao
Zedong Thought as its guiding ideology, which was a historic
decision with epoch-making importance. This contributed greatly to
the victory of the new democratic revolution, he said.
</P>
<P>
The 15th National Party Congress, he said, has decided to take
Deng Xiaoping Theory as its guiding ideology, which is another
historic decision with epoch-making importance.
</P>
<P>
The economic theory constitutes an important part in Deng
Xiaoping Theory and the ownership issue takes an important
position in the economic theory, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that the Chinese Communist Party made an important
decision to take economic development as the center of the Party's
basic line after the ten-year "Cultural Revolution." It is the
first great step in the emancipation of the mind, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the second great step in emancipating the minds of the
Chinese people is marked by the talks made by Deng Xiaoping during
his south China tour in 1992. The talks resulted in China's move
to establish a socialist market economy as a goal in economic
restructuring suggested by the 14th National Party Congress later
that year.
</P>
<P>
The decision made by the current Party congress which affirms
that public ownership takes diversified forms is another key step
in China's emancipation of the mind, Li said.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Press Lashes out at Albright's Mideast Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Iranian press today lashed
out at the first visit to the Middle East by U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright since taking office in January.
</P>
<P>
The official English daily Tehran Times noted in its editorial
that Albright's on-going tour of the region "is obviously a visit
to work out a more effective anti-Iran policy with the Zionist
regime."
</P>
<P>
Another English daily Iran News said in its editorial that Iran
must arm itself to respond to U.S.-Israeli plots, which are aimed
at tarnishing Iran's image before the international public opinion.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper was apparently referring to Albright's remarks
made after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
in Jerusalem earlier this week which termed Iran as a threat to
the regional peace and stability because it is seeking weapons of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
"In an orchestrated move, both Washington and Tel Aviv are now
out to launch a joint onslaught against what they see is
Iran-Russia growing relations," the Tehran Times said.
</P>
<P>
The Iran News criticized the United States for opposing other
countries maintaining normal ties with Iran and selling it nuclear
technology for civil and scientific purposes.
</P>
<P>
The paper accused Israel of refusing to sign the treaty of ban
on nuclear tests which Iran has already signed.
</P>
<P>
It stressed Iran does not seek weapons of mass destruction and
will prove that U.S. and Israel want to impose their hegemony over
Iran after making it vulnerable.

DALIAN, China, September 13 (Xinhua) -- China squandered a 2-0
lead to concede a 4-2 loss to Iran in a World Cup Asian zone
qualifier here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team opened scoring at the 43rd minute as captain
Fan Zhiyi converted a penalty shot to beat the Iranian
goal-keeper.
</P>
<P>
Nine minutes after interval, Li Ming made it 2-0 with a superb
right-foot shot.
</P>
<P>
It seemed the Chinese team would win their first match in the
Asian finals, but the Iranian team fought back steadily and
narrowed the gap to 2-1 also through a penalty kick.
</P>
<P>
Mehdi Mahdavi Kiya levelled the score 2-2 at the 67th minute
and went on to score his second goal in the match to give Iran a
3-2 lead 16 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team appeared tired and their all-out attack left
too much space for the counter-attacks of the Iranians. A fatal
mistake made by the Chinese defence line at the 84th minute
enabled Ali Asghar Modir Rousta to seal the match 4-2 for the
Iranian team.
</P>
<P>
The defeat is a severe blow to the Chinese team in the
qualifying group which also includes Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and
Qatar.

<HEADLINE> Qiao Shi on Significance of 15th Party Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The 15th National Congress of
the Communist Party of China, which is going on here at the turn
of the century, is a meeting of historic significance, Qiao Shi said
here today.
</P>
<P>
It will exert a great impact on China's development in the
21st century, he said in a panel discussion held here today by
delegates from east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
A number of delegates, including Li Zemin, shared the view that
Jiang Zemin's report, made at the opening session, summed up the
experience gained since China introduced the policy of reforms and
opening-up, concentrated the wisdom of the whole party and all the
people across the country. "It is a programmatic document
which inspires the whole nation in the march towards the new
century,' he said.
</P>
<P>
Qiao voiced his agreement to their opinion. He said facts had
shown that China would not have made the achievements today
without the guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory on building socialism
with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
This is the demand of the times and the aspirations of the
people, he added.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping put forward the statement that China is still in
the primary stage of socialism when preparations were underway
for the convention of the 13th National Party Congress, Qiao
recalled.
</P>
<P>
It is of vital importance that Jiang Zemin reiterated the
statement in his report to the opening session of the on-going
15th National Party congress. This shows that the Party has
improved its understanding on socialism and its national
condition, Qiao said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's report covered a wide range of key issues including
the experience gained in the reform of state-owned enterprises,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
China will become even more prosperous in the 21st century so
long as we combine theory with practice and work in a down-to-earth
attitude.

<HEADLINE> Diverse Forms for Public Ownership to Promote Economic Growth, Li Peng (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China has made remarkable progress in economic development over
the recent few years. The reason for the great achievements, he
said, is that China has handled well the relations between reform,
development and stability and effectively curbed inflation.
</P>
<P>
With China's rapid economic development, he said, the
percentage of public ownership in the gross domestic product (GDP)
has dropped while that of non-public ownership has risen. As a
result, some state-owned enterprises are not operating so well,
which prompted doubts and arguments among some people.
</P>
<P>
However, Li Peng said, the latest statistics from the State
Statistics Bureau shows that in the mixed sector of the economy
the public ownership accounts for one third, or seven percentage
points of China's economy as a whole.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, he said, China produced 6.9 trillion yuan in the GDP,
of which public ownership accounted for 5.2 trillion, or 76
percent. This means that the public ownership still takes a
dominant position in China's economy.
</P>
<P>
On the impact of foreign investment on China's domestic
industries, Li said the move will not affect China's domestic
industries as long as the country sticks to the principle of
innovation and absorbing it after introducing technologies and
management expertise from abroad.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng said there exist great financial potentials both in the
international and domestic capital markets. In the domestic
market, he said, China's savings deposits have reached four
trillion yuan which can quench fund shortage in China's economic
construction.
</P>
<P>
Share-holding is an organizational form of capitals for modern
enterprises which can apply in both capitalist and socialist
countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the development of stock market, Li said China lacks
experience in standardizing stock market. Stock market is a source
of financing for construction and technological transformation for
enterprises and it can help promote management for share-holding
firms, he said.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that there had been chaos in China's stock
market but it returned to normal soon after the State Council took
effective measures.
</P>
<P>
He told the congress delegates that China will list more firms
in the stock market. Stock market, he said, should support the
reform of large state firms. The Chinese government encourages
those enterprises with advantages and good economic returns to
merger those debt-ridden enterprises so that they can complement
each other.

Thoughts.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Diary of Party Congress Delegates (Sept. 13) - 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The report demands that the Chinese people fully assess the
influence future science and technology, hi-technology in
particular, will exert on the national strength, the social and
economic structure and people's living standards.
</P>
<P>
The report also demands that accelerating scientific and
technological progress should enjoy an essential status in the
economic and social development, so as to make the progress in
science and technology and improvement in laborers' qualities the
real impetus to economic development.
</P>
<P>
The way the report analyzes things from strategic points of
view is an expression of broad vision and far-sightedness.
</P>
<P>
Writing this into the report to the congress is of great
significance for the country's cross-century development.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, I think that the report has set new requirements for
the intellectuals. The report demands intellectuals study more to
become disseminators of advanced thoughts, pioneers of science and
technology, and producers of fine cultural works.
</P>
<P>
The report is an encouragement for the people from the circle
of science and technology, the circle of culture and education,
and other intellectuals. It will inspire us to work energetically
for creations and inventions, and become cultural forces that will
shoulder the historic responsibilities for the country and the
nation.
</P>
<P>
After the congress, the Chinese Academy of Sciences will
reassess its role in the scientific progress of the mankind and
development of the country. The CAS will do what ordinary
universities and enterprises are incapable of accomplishing.
</P>
<P>
We shall inherit historical traditions, get rid of the
drawbacks left over by the planned economy, and search for new
modes that could keep abreast of the times. We shall combine our
advantages in personnel and science and technology with the needs
of the society, and develop national hi-tech industries through
speeding up basic research as well as hi-tech innovations.
</P>
<P>
Continuing to organize its main forces to contribute to key
economic progresses and keep a capable force to achieve
breakthroughs, the CAS will also provide the nation with
consultations for top-level decisions.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the CAS will spread scientific knowledge to the people
in the society and advocate scientific spirits and ethics.
</P>
<P>
As a scientist and a teacher with many years of experience, I
feel excited over the prospect of China.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti PM to Return Home to Reshuffle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Crown Prince and
Prime Minister Sheikh Saad Al-Abdallah Al-Sabah will return home
from a long health recovery in London by the end of this month to
reshuffle his cabinet, a local newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
English daily Arab Times quoted highly informed sources who
asked not to be named as saying Saad's return would pave the
way for a major cabinet reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
The sources revealed the new cabinet is expected to include
several new faces with expanded authority. But they gave no direct
reasons for the talked reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
Saad suffered a bleeding in the colon and undertook an
operation in March. Later he was flown to London where he
underwent further surgeries and has since then been recuperating
there.
</P>
<P>
It was revealed that Saad has prepared an action plan for the
country, based on all the events that took place during his
absence.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Saad will form a new cabinet to carry out
the new plan, and this will set fourth a new era in the local
politics.
</P>
<P>
They said that the new plan would be based on appointing
"strong and competent" members in the cabinet, who will not be
changed every four years in common practice.
</P>
<P>
The practice in Kuwait politics has been that cabinets and
ministers must be changed every four years to coincide
parliamentary elections. But the rule would be changed if the
reshuffle takes place.

for world noted Nobel laureate Mother Teresa in Calcutta today.
</P>
<P>
Mother Teresa passed away at her home at the headquarters of

cardiac arrest. She was born on August 26,1910 in Yugoslavia of
Albanian parents and came to India's Calcutta in 1928 when she was

her. Crowds threw flowers and wiped tears as the cortege passed
by.
</P>
<P>
The Archbishop of Calcutta, Henry DOS's in his speech spoke
highly of the Mother Trees. He said that the Mother's greatest
contribution to the world was that she saved the people the value

<HEADLINE> Roundup: India, Pakistan Ready to Continue Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Despite their grave
differences over the Kashmir issue, both India and Pakistan, the
two arch-rivals in South Asia, still want to continue their talks
in the interest of improving relations and enhancing economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
India Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral and his Pakistani
counterpart Nawaz Sharif are to meet in New York on September 24
as part of efforts to ensure that the recently initiated dialogue
between the two countries "remains on track."
</P>
<P>
The announcement about the Gujral-Sharif breakfast meeting in
New York was made by visiting Pakistani Information Minister
Mushahid Hussain after he met Gujral here on Friday. It has
cleared the air of uncertainty after initial hesitation for the
second summit meeting this year.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers met in the Maldives in May on the
sidelines of a summit of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC).
</P>
<P>
In that meeting, they reached an agreement
to continue their dialogues and set up several joint working
groups to iron out their main differences including the issue of
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Last night, India and Pakistan announced that the third round
of the foreign secretary-level talks between the two countries
would be held in New Delhi from September 15 to 18. The talks,
stalled for about three years due to their dispute over Kashmir,
were resumed in New Delhi in March this year and the second round
was held in Islamabad in June.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a group of students and teachers at the School of
International Studies of the Jawaharlal Nehru University here
Friday, Hussain said the Indo-Pakistan summit meeting in New York
was to ensure that dialogue remains on track and the core issue of
Jammu and Kashmir is discussed at the highest political level.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, there have been certain signals from Delhi that
the understanding arrived at on June 23 (during the second round
of foreign secretary-level talks) will not be fully acceptable to
India. There have been indications that India will no longer be
willing to focus on regional peace and security and Jammu and
Kashmir," Hussain said.
</P>
<P>
"But to say that these issues be kept frozen while agreeing to
set up working groups on the other six issues is a violation of
the letter and spirit of the agreement," Hussain said.
</P>
<P>
He described Kashmir as the "primary roadblock to the
normalization of relations between India and Pakistan, the core
issue which cannot be wished away."
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the summit meeting and the third round of
foreign secretary-level meeting between the two countries came in
the wake of Pakistan asking India to clarify whether it still
stands by the early joint statement by the foreign secretaries
providing for "focused discussions" on Kashmir and regional peace
and security.
</P>
<P>
The meetings are expected to clear the logjam in the foreign
secretary-level talks, which appeared to have reached an impasse
after some initial bonhomie.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia's CPO, Tin, Rubber Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's markets of
the Crude palm oil (CPO) physicals, tin and rubber closed the week
mixed.
</P>
<P>
The CPO physicals closed the week higher. Against last week,
September South closed 5 ringgit (about 1.7 U.S. dollars) higher
at 1,365 ringgit (about 470.6 U.S. dollars) per ton.
</P>
<P>
The easier ringgit, which eased to the 2.95 level at the close
after hovering between 2.88 and 2.89 level earlier in the week,
was one of the factors that has been influencing the uptrend of
crude palm oil prices, a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
The Indian State Trading Corporation (STC) which tendered for
6,000 tons of Refined, Bleached and Deodorized (RBD) palm olein
for September 25 to October 5 and another 6,000 tons of RBD palm
olein for October 1 to 15 shipments, also aided market sentiment.
</P>
<P>
Private crop forecaster Ivan Wong forecasted that Malaysia's
August CPO production is estimated to increase by two percent to
850,000 tons over July's estimate.

This week, the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM), started off
lower as the ringgit recovered its strength against the U.S.
dollar, but tin price improved thereafter as the ringgit slipped
against the greenback towards the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
Tin price ended the week at 15.66 ringgit (about 5.4 U.S.
dollars) per kg, unchanged from last week's close.
</P>
<P>
For the week, accumulated turnover rose to 545 tons from 468
tons last week with European and local buyers dominating the bulk
of the week's market transaction.
</P>
<P>
However, the Malaysian rubber market performed poorly despite
the weaker ringgit which failed to boost the commodity's price.
</P>
<P>
Most players opted to remain sidelined despite the fact that
Malaysian rubber has become cheaper due to the cheaper ringgit and
the fact that the commodity was in short supply due to the rainy
season in Malaysia and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Against last week, October RSS One dipped eight sen to 256.50
sen (about 88.4 U.S. cents) per kg and SMR 20 fell by five sen to
257.00 sen (about 88.6 U.S. cents) per kg.
</P>
<P>
Sentiment on the local rubber market is expected to improve
next week as most European buyers are anticipated to return to the
market to seek fresh supply following the end of the long summer
holidays, a dealer said.

<HEADLINE> National Strike Called off in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's opposition lobby
group National Convention Executive Council (NCEC) has called off
a national strike set for next week with aims to press for total
constitutional reforms, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The NCEC was quoted as saying that it was calling off the
planned strike "to give Kenyans enough time to digest what has
been offered and tell us the way forward."
</P>
<P>
The move, seen as a swift turn-around, came after a majority
of parliamentary members reach a consensus on a landmark
political reforms package hammered into shape by the
Inter-Parties Parliamentary Group (IPPG) Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, the NCEC dismissed the package as a "gigantic fraud"
which would help retain President Daniel arap Moi in power.
</P>
<P>
Allowing a winning president to name ministers from all
parties, the IPPG package has given him the mandate to destroy
the opposition from parliament, NCEC spokesman Kivutha Kibwana
charged Friday.
</P>
<P>
What the IPPG did was to "merely skim the surface without
disturbing the basis status quo" of the political system of this
east African country, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the day, religious leaders gave an unequivocal green light
to the package, saying they would monitor the IPPG to ensure the
reforms process was successfully completed.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Third Largest Party to Withdraw Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Former President of Bangladesh
HM Ershad on Friday castigated the incumbent government for
failure to run the country and said his party would not support it
any more, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Ershad, Chairman of the third largest Jatiya (national) party
in Bangladesh, told a public meeting on central Tangail city that
his party would play the role of real opposition political party
from now.
</P>
<P>
"The Awami (people's) League (AL) in its 14-month reign didn't
do a single good work. There is no scope to support this
government," said Ershad, whose party lent support to the AL in
forming government and got a post in the cabinet after last year's
election.
</P>
<P>
Ershad said that he extended his support to the AL with the
hope that it would do better than the former ruling Bangladesh
Nationalist Party. But the AL did not fulfill its pledges to the
people it committed during its election campaign, he added.
</P>
<P>
The JP supremo also said that his party would withdraw
Secretary General Anwar Hossain Monju from the cabinet very soon,
and "he (Hossain Monju) pledged to do so".
</P>
<P>
The former military ruler, who was deposed through a mass
upheaval in 1990 after a nine-year rule, said there is no
alternative to JP to run the country.
</P>
<P>
"The JP is neither a pro-Pakistani nor pro-Indian party. It is
a real Bangladeshi and it will uphold the cause of Bangladeshi
people," claimed Ershad, adding that he hoped the JP will form the
next government.

<HEADLINE> 6 Lebanese Soldiers Killed in Israeli Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Six Lebanese soldiers were
killed and four others wounded Friday in an Israeli attack in
south Lebanon, local newspaper the Beirut's Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
At 23:10 (20:10 GMT) local time, several Israeli helicopters
fired missiles at a Lebanese army position between the three towns
of Arabsalim, Houmin Fawqa and Jarjoueh in the Iqlim Tufah region.
</P>
<P>
The position faces the Israeli-occupied border enclave in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
A Lebanese woman living nearby was also wounded in the fighting
and later died in hospital, the newspaper added.
</P>
<P>
Half an hour earlier, one Lebanese soldier was wounded in
another Israeli attack on a military school in Arabsalim.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese army responded to the attacks with machine-gun
fires at the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
In another development some hours earlier, several fighters of
the Lebanese Islamic Hezbollah were killed and four Israeli
soldiers wounded in their clashes on the edge of the enclave.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed resistance force announced in a communique
that it had ambushed an Israeli army patrol which was attempting
to infiltrate into the Lebanese-controlled areas.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese security sources said that the Hezbollah fighters
fired anti-tank rockets and automatic weapons at the patrol near
Jabal al Rafai, in the no-man's land between the Israeli-occupied
zone and the rest of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The conflict in south Lebanon has intensified in recent weeks,
with Lebanese guerrillas foiling a Israeli commando raid last week
near the Lebanese port city of Saida, which left 12 Israeli
soldiers dead.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The peace negotiators of the
Philippine government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF)
rebels have started to make the implementing guidelines for the
general ceasefire agreement they signed in July.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine News Agency today quoted Al Haj Murad, MILF vice
chairman for military affairs, as saying that the two sides signed
an agreement after holding another round of low-level talks in
Cotabato city, the southern Philippines, on September 11-12.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the government and the MILF would
form their respective administrative committee to coordinate with
each other for the enforcement of the ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also contained the composition, meetings, powers
and functions of the committees and the creation of an independent
fact-finding committee.
</P>
<P>
The agreement did not include the rules governing the conduct
of military forces and MILF rebels in battle fronts and neutral
grounds and the determination of truce violations.
</P>
<P>
The negotiators agreed to discuss the remaining issues at their
following meetings.
</P>
<P>
Murad was optimistic about the peace process. He even hinted
that a peace agreement between the MILF and the government would
be signed before President Fidel Ramos' term ends in June next
year.
</P>
<P>
MILF, a 12,000-member rebel group, was now the major block to
final peace in the southern Philippines.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 13 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will
participate in the bid to host the 2008 summer Olympics,
President Sam Ramsamy of National Olympic Committee of South
Africa (NOCSA) said at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's 2008 Olympic bid would depend on local cities
submitting their separate bid by the year 2000, Ramsamy told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the fact that we failed in the recent bid, we still
did very well by coming third. It made our possibilities for
getting the games in 2008 greater," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Cape Town, the legislative capital of South Africa, came third
of the five cities competing for hosting the 2004 Olympic Games.
The city received 60 votes in the first round and 22 in the
second. In the third round, however, the votes in its favor were
eliminated to 20.
</P>
<P>
Once cities in the country applied to participate in the 2008
bid, said Ramsamy, the next step for NOCSA would be to evaluate
the cities according to the Olympic charter of the International
Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
"We need to look at why Athens won and learn lessons from the
bid winning city," he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides Athens and Cape Town, Rome, Stockholm and Buenos Aires
were among the final bidding cities.

<P>
LUSAKA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
European Union has commended Zambia for its economic policies
which are described as being positive toward attaining a
sustainable national economy.
</P>
<P>
Officiating a training and consultancy workshop in Lusaka
Friday, Charles Brook, head of a delegation of the EU commission,
said Zambia's economy has great potential and stood a chance of
performing well, Zambia's Daily Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
Referring to a financial assistance of 138 million U.S.
Dollars to be given to African, Caribbean and Pacific countries
(ACP), Brook said at the closing of the two-week workshop that EU
should have loved Zambia to move at a faster rate in implementing
its economic policies.
</P>
<P>
He added that a bulk of the EU grant would go to the areas
which the Zambian government has attached top priority when
addressing social problems such as gender issues, poverty and
illiteracy.
</P>
<P>
The workshop held here as well as in other countries is part
of the EU program which aims at training 200 EU commission staff

Cape Town, the legislative capital of South Africa, came third
of the five cities competing for hosting the 2004 Olympic Games.
The city received 60 votes in the first round and 22 in the
second. In the third round, however, the votes in its favor were
eliminated to 20.
</P>
<P>
Once cities in the country applied to participate in the 2008
bid, said Ramsamy, the next step for NOCSA would be to evaluate
the cities according to the Olympic charter of the International
Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
"We need to look at why Athens won and learn lessons from the
bid winning city," he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides Athens and Cape Town, Rome, Stockholm and Buenos Aires
were among the final bidding cities.

<HEADLINE> Reasonable Prices for Zambia's Copper Mines Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has urged the bidder
of the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) to offer
reasonable prices for ZCCM assets.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Ronald Penza said in a special business
review program on Zambian National Broadcasting Corporation
(ZNBC) Friday night that mining remains a major component of the
country's economy as such ZCCM needs to be sold at the best price
offer.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia quoted him as saying that "I urge parties
negotiating to pay reasonable assets prices and commit a long-term
program of reinvestment."
</P>
<P>
Penza also called on southern African countries to strengthen
regional integration and allow free flow of goods and services.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent reference to Dunlop, a victim of competition
from heavily subsidized South African imports, he blamed some
countries in the region for being too slow to remove tariffs.
</P>
<P>
He said Zambia is way ahead and could not apply the same rules
as the countries are subsidizing goods.
</P>
<P>
"Unless we go into regional integration and allow relative
comparative advantage to determine the flow of goods and
services, the region as a whole is going to suffer," he said.
</P>
<P>
Penza was particularly disappointed with Dunlop management for
lacking patience even after it agreed to suspend closure until
appropriate tariffs for imports are introduced.
</P>
<P>
"We agreed to work on safeguard measures in order to ensure we
do not ban but apply appropriate tariffs. I would have expected
Dunlop to have waited for parliament to sit," the minister said.

<HEADLINE> b d p 1771 China-Congress-Army (Details Added) Liu Huaqing on Armed Forces Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Liu Huaqing today described
the reduction of China's armed forces by 500,000 in the next three
years as a "major measure to improve the quality of the People's
Liberation Army (PLA)".
</P>
<P>
The reduction was announced by Jiang Zemin in his report to the
on-going 15th National Party Congress Friday morning. China
already cut its armed forces by one million in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Joining other army delegates to the congress in a panel
discussion, the Chinese military leader said China will work hard
to improve scientific research in national defense and improve the
overall quality of weaponry and equipment.
</P>
<P>
"It is an important part of Deng Xiaoping's thinking on army
building in the new period to improve the quality of the Chinese
army and take the road of fewer but better troops. This is a
correct choice to materize the modernization of armed forces in
China," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We should take the chance to readjust the system of and the
establishment for the army and make it smaller in size but more
capable in strength, he added.
</P>
<P>
It is imperative to train a large number of military personnel
who know the art of modern wars, especially commanders who are
well versed in high technology, through improved education at
military institutes and intensified training in the army units, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We should adhere to taking the military thinking of Mao Zedong
and Deng Xiaoping's thinking on army building in the new period to
guide the foreseeing of the trend of global military development
in a scientific way, emancipate the mind, blaze new trails and
explore the military theory with the characteristics of the
Chinese army," Liu said.

<HEADLINE> Diary of Party Congress Delegates (Sept. 13) - 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- (At Xinhua's request, some
delegates to the ongoing 15th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) write what they see, discuss and think during
the congress in diary form, which we think will provide outsiders
with some information about this major event. The following diary,
the second of its kind, was written by Lu Yongxiang, president of
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). -- editor)
</P>
<P>
In his report delivered at the opening session of the congress
yesterday morning, Jiang made a complete and incisive exposition
about the future and destiny of China. The report could well be
regarded as the Party's cross-century declaration.
</P>
<P>
Yet what encourages me most is the fact that science and
technology have been regarded as essential elements for achieving
economic progress. The report also focuses on the policy of
"invigorating China with science and technology" and the target to
improve the general quality of the entire people. I think that
education in science and technology has never received so much
attention in the past.
</P>
<P>
The report reflects the characteristics of the period and the
requirements of the socialist modernization drive. In addition,
the report shows that the collective Party leadership has a good
command and judgement over the development trend of the world.
</P>
<P>
The challenges China faces today mainly stem from increasingly
acute competition worldwide, as well as the pressure China feels
because it lags behind the developed countries in terms of economy
and science and technology.
</P>
<P>
The coming 21st century will be a period marked by economic
globalization, better-education and fast development of science
and technology. New scientific discoveries and technological
revolution will give rise to new industrial revolutions, which
will ultimately change the feature of the economic and social
life, and even the world.
</P>
<P>
Science and technology will be a key element in determining
economic development, as well as the fundamental index of the
comprehensive national strength.
</P>
<P>
The quality and creativity of the people, I believe, will be
the foundation and motivation to enhance the competitiveness of the
country.

JOHANNESBURG, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia's Defense
and Aviation Minister Sultan Adbulaziz Al-Saudi would visit South
Africa from September 23 to 29, the Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Abudulaziz, who is also the Kingdom's second Deputy Prime
Minister, would hold talks with President Nelson Mandela, his
South African counterpart Joe Modise and several other government
ministers.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and South Africa are finalizing a 1.5 billion
U.S. Dollars deal for the sale of G6 motorized artillery pieces
and anti-aircraft weapon systems.
</P>
<P>
It is the largest arms deal in South African history and is
expected to create 30,000 jobs over five years.
</P>
<P>
The controversial arms deal hit the headlines in July when
Denel, the country's major arms manufacturer, sought an interim
court order to prohibit newspapers from identifying Saudi Arabia
as the client country.
</P>
<P>
However, local media ignored the court order and identified
the Middle Eastern country. Its name had already been published
abroad. The crisis had jeopardized the deal as the
confidentiality clause of the proposed deal had been violated.
</P>
<P>
South African human rights and foreign policy opponents of the
deal argue that the country should not sell arms to the world's
most volatile region.

<HEADLINE> French ELF Oil Co. in Angola to Produce 100,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- France's ELF Oil Company will
produce 100,000 barrels of oil daily in Angola by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Patrior Tuibart, general manager of the ELF Exploration
Angola, a branch company of ELF, made the statement to the press
the other day.
</P>
<P>
He said, the production will mainly come from sea-bed drilling
in Angola. And by 2005, the productions will reach 200,000
barrels.
</P>
<P>
It is predicted that ELF Oil Company will invest 1.5 to 2
billion U.S. Dollars in the Girassol oil field which was
discovered in April, 1996, to boost production. At present, the
daily production of the oil field is 2,800 barrels.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Dalia No.1 oil field recently tapped in the
sea bed of Angola, the manager said, this is the biggest oil
field the company discovered in Angola, with a daily production of
16,000 barrels from the first well.
</P>
<P>
It is still early to estimate the reserve of the oil field, he
added, but admitting this is a major discovery of the company.
</P>
<P>
According to Tuibart, ELF company has been well acquainted
with the geological structure in Angola after spending many years
in the country. However, he added, it still requires more oil
fields to realize the goal of 100,000 barrels daily by 2000.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, the company is sending out Angolans to France,
Portugal and other European countries to study relevant
technology.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Retreat from Opposition Stronghold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Afghan Islamic Taliban
militia have retreated from the opposition stronghold of
Mazar-e-Sharif, around 300 km north of capital of Kabul, Afghan
sources said today.
</P>
<P>
Taliban fighters lost control of Mazar-e-Sharif airport, about
18 km east of the city, on Friday evening under vigorous
counter-attacks by their rival alliance forces, the Afghan sources
here confirmed.
</P>
<P>
The front-line now was shifted to about two km east of the
Mazar-e-Sharif airport, they said, adding the order in the
northern major city was restored after three days of looting.
</P>
<P>
"The city is much calmer, and people are back to the streets,"
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Mazar-e-Sharif, the second largest city in Afghanistan, now
serves as headquarters of the anti-Taliban alliance, which
comprises forces loyal to Uzbek warlord Abdul Malik, former
military chief Ahmad Masood and Shiite Hezb-e-Wadhat.
</P>
<P>
In Kabul, a 10-year-old girl was killed and two women injured
today when a heavy rocket fired at the Afghan capital's airport
overshot the perimeter and struck a farming area, according to a
report monitored here.
</P>
<P>
The airport is being used as an air base for Taliban to supply
troops battling near Mazar-e-Sharif. So far none of the rockets
have hit the airport.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two months, anti-Taliban forces under Masood's
command have been battling the hard-line militia in front lines
only 25 km north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, which control two thirds of the Afghan territory
and capital of Kabul, have vowed to impose strict Islamic rule in
the war-torn country.

<HEADLINE> 15,000 Congolese Refugees to Go Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Another batch of
Congolese (K) refugees numbering some 15,000 will be voluntarily
repatriated to their homeland by October this year, according to
a news dispatch reaching here from Kigoma today.
</P>
<P>
The arrangement for the repatriation is under a tripartite
agreement reached among the Democratic Republic of Congo,
Tanzania and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) on August 20 in Dar es Salaam, the report quoted UNHCR
officials in Kigoma, western Tanzania, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian refugee camps have hosted 74,000 Congolese refugees
at Kasulu and Lugufu in Kigoma Region. Already, 1,124 refugees
have left for Congo (K) since September 2 under the tripartite
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Michael Phillips, a UNHCR representative in the Congolese
district of Uvira was quoted as saying that returning refugees
should not worry of their lives as "everything is under control,
all those who have returned have been sent to heir home villages
and are enjoying life there."
</P>
<P>
"We haven't received any complaints from the refugees. They
are happy at home," said Phillips who accompanied the returning
refugees aboard a ship in Lake Tanganyiga early this month.
</P>
<P>
The new administration in Congo (K) has appealed to returning
refugees to bury their political and ethnic differences and come
out together to rebuild the nation which had been ravaged by
civil war and political uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
While welcoming the returning refugees last week, Uvira
District Commissioner Bashire Kusebana appealed to them to love
one another in this time of reconstruction of Congo (K).

<HEADLINE> India's Congress Leader Plans UF Government Ouster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 13 (Xinhua) -- India's Congress President
Sitaram Kesri has decided to examine the possibility of
withdrawing support from the United Front (UF) government headed
by Inder Kumar Gujral around February next year, a local English
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Congress is expected not to allow the UF government to pass
the next budget early next year, the Statesman quoted senior
Congress leaders as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to senior party leaders, Kesri will be sending
central observers to every state to solicit the views of the
party's local units on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Kesri himself believes that if the present government is
allowed to pass one more budget, that would make the Congress
weaker as it will not be in a position to avoid the responsibility
of any downslide in the economy. He also believes that the UF may
not be in a position to stay together till February next year.
</P>
<P>
The Congress supports the 13-party UF government from the
outside. As the UF government is a minority coalition, it will
immediately fall if the Congress withdraws its support. In March
this year, the UF government headed by Deve Gowda stepped down
following the withdrawal of support by the Congress, and the
Gujral government took office the next month.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Kuala Lumpur Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Prolonged profit-taking
gave way to bargain-hunting which propelled the Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange to close stronger this week.
</P>
<P>
A sudden surge of more than 200-points in just two trading days
after the government lifted the designated status of the Composite
Index 100-components on September 4 prompted a strong correction
this week with the market well supported at above the 800-level.
</P>
<P>
The 100-quality stocks Composite Index jumped 30.49 points to
852.08, the all-share Emas Index gained 11.70 points to 242.88,
the Industrial Index was 89.82 points higher at 1,747.40 while the
Second Board Index surged 44.90 points to 445.91.
</P>
<P>
The week saw profit-taking taking its toll on prices for most
of the trading days. Analysts and dealers said the profit-taking
was justified as players were trying to minimize recent losses.
</P>
<P>
Foreign funds were cautious in trading as they were concerned
over Malaysia's macro-economic picture especially on the current
account deficit (CAD).
</P>
<P>
On September 10, Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim
announced that government expenditure will be reduced by two
percent, mega projects will be deferred and that all new
privatized projects and purchase of foreign goods will be
reviewed.
</P>
<P>
The government's measures are heading towards the right
direction and confidence is slowly seeping back into the market
following the launch of the one billion ringgit (about 344.8
million U.S. dollars) government bonds, part of the 60 billion
ringgit (over 20 billion U.S. dollars) package announced recently
to shore up the local bourse, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
They are optimistic the market will breach the 880 points level
or even the 900 points level next week for a more convincing
upturn.
</P>
<P>
This week saw one leading self adhesive label converter --
Komarkcorp Bhd -- making its debut on the market and three
counters -- Tongkah, TSH Resources and Pantai Hospital --
suspended.
</P>
<P>
During the week, the mainboard volume was slightly higher at
1.901 billion shares worth 8.433 billion ringgit (about 2.9
billion U.S. dollars) from 1.802 billion shares valued at 7.035
billion ringgit (about 2.4 billion U.S. dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
The second board turnover stood at 316.012 million shares
valued at 2.672 billion ringgit (about 921 million U.S. dollars)
against last week's 167.200 million shares worth 1.326 billion
ringgit (about 457 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Off-market deals amounted to 145.903 million shares worth
810.166 million ringgit (about 279 million U.S. dollars) against
165.428 million shares valued at 625.819 million ringgit (about
215 million U.S. dollars) at last week's close.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Gelbard Reaffirms U.S. Support for Bosnia's Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. special envoy Robert
Gelbard has reaffirmed U.S. support for the municipal elections in
Bosnia due to be held in September 13 and 14.
</P>
<P>
Gelbard, after his meeting with Bosnian Serb President Biljana
Plavsic Friday night in Banja Luka, said that international
community only provides aid for those making full implementation
of the 1995 Dayton peace accords and taking an active part in the
coming municipal elections in Bosnia, which he believed will be
"free and fair."
</P>
<P>
Serbs, Muslims and Croats will vote for 136 municipalities in
the two-day elections, which have been postponed twice.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Serbs and Croat once threatened to boycott the
elections, but Plavsic said she expected the polls to take
place in a quiet atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the Interior Ministry of the Bosnian Serb Republic
in Pale announced today that the Ministry has taken every measure
necessary to ensure safe elections in accordance with the Dayton
accords.
</P>
<P>
Gelbard also said that the U.S. will continue to support the
early elections for Bosnian Serb parliament, which Plavsic
dissolved in July, a move rejected by her rivals in Bosnian Serb
parliament and government.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Serb Constitutional Court declared in August the
dissolution of parliament by Plavsic "does not conform with the
constitution" and was thus "invalid."

<HEADLINE> Ailing Economy Hits Thai Printing Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's economic slump may
force one-third of the country's printing houses, including
publishers of newspapers and magazines, to close down, according
to a report of the Thai Farmers' Research Center.
</P>
<P>
Publishers are now faced with three main problems -- falling
circulation, dwindling advertising and rising costs.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, four daily newspapers, including the
English-language Asia Times and Thailand Times, have folded.
</P>
<P>
Nearly all existing newspapers are making internal adjustments
to survive.
</P>
<P>
About 120,000 of the sector's 800,000 workers have been laid
off and 30 percent have had their salaries reduced, the center
said in a recent report.
</P>
<P>
Some publishing companies have cut back welfare payments,
bonuses and overseas coverage trips and closed overseas bureaus
and are controlling more tightly newsprint use.
</P>
<P>
The prices of imported pulp, paper and ink have soared
following the floatation and depreciation of the Thai currency.
</P>
<P>
Advertising revenue, the industry's main source of income, has
also taken a sharp dive, as companies such as property developers
have dramatically trimmed their advertising budgets, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Classified ad in some newspapers has shrunk to about a dozen
pages from about two dozens or more.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Holds Exile Group Responsible for Bombing Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Cuba said Thursday that a
leading Cuban exile group in the United States was behind the
recent bomb attacks on Havana hotels and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
There were "thousands of examples" in the past linking the
group, the Miami-based Cuban American National Foundation (CANF),
to violent attempts to overthrow Cuban President Fidel Castro and
communist rule in Cuba, Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Marianela
Ferriol said at a regular Foreign Ministry press briefing.
</P>
<P>
"We have convincing arguments and proof of the participation of
the (Cuban American National) Foundation in plans to try to
overthrow the Cuban Revolution," the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
The CANF has denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
Hotels and restaurants in Havana were bombed at least eight
times from June to September, killing an Italian businessman on
September 4. The Cuban Interior Ministry released a statement
Wednesday condemning the CANF for the attacks, saying the group
organized and financed the bombings.
</P>
<P>
The statement said a Salvadoran "mercenary," employed by the
CANF, had been arrested and confessed to planting bombs in hotels
and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has said it would help investigate the case
if Cuba provides detailed evidence for the link between the
Salvadoran and the CANF.

<HEADLINE> Hu Jintao Calls for Arming Party With Deng Xiaoping Theory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The 15th National Congress of
the Communist Party of China (CPC) is a meeting of great
significance and far-reaching historical importance in the
development of the Party and the country, said Hu Jintao here
today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a discussion attended by Tibetan delegates to the
congress this morning, Hu Jintao said the theme of the current
congress is to hold high the great basnner of Deng Xiaoping Theory
for an all-round advancement of the cause of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics to the 21st century. It tallies with
the wishes of the Party and the people and represents the
requirements of the times and the aspirations of the people, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that the congress is sure to mobilize and
unite all members of the Party and of all ethnic groups in the
country and march along the road of socialism with Chinese
characteristics charted by Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
During the discussion, Chen Kuiyuan, secretary of the Tibetan
Automous Regional Committee of the Communist Party of China, and
two other Tibetan delegates highly praised the report given by
Jiang Zemin at the opening session held yesterday.
</P>
<P>
They also reviewed the achievements Tibet scored in the reform
and development over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
They were of the view that Jiang's report covered a wide range
of subjects, talking about problems in an in-depth way and seeking
truth from facts.
</P>
<P>
After hearing their speeches, Hu said, "The five years since
the 14th Party Congress constituted an unusual period in which our
cause advanced."
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping Theory and the basic line guiding the work in the
primary stage of socialism set in accordance with this theory have
been proved to be entirely correct, he said.
</P>
<P>
Practice in the past five years has shown that the Party
Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core has been
persisting in the basic theory and the basic line of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics and is capable of
controlling the overall situation, uniting the people and
advancing the great cause of China. It is a united, staunch and
mature leading body, Hu added.
</P>
<P>
At present, he stated, "we are confronted with rare
opportunities and grave challenges. Various kinds of problems are
unvoidable on our way ahead. We must be sober-minded and
cautious."
</P>
<P>
"On the new long march into the next century, we must hold high
the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory and make it a guidance
for our work in all trades," he added.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to arm the whole Party and all officials and
the people with Deng Xiaoping Theory, he stressed, adding this is
a long-term stratetic task.
</P>
<P>
"We should be fully aware that we are still in the primary
stage of socialism. We should tackle the major problems in this
period, take economic development as the central task and
concentrate on developing the productive forces," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the course of deepening the reform and building a socialist
market economy, it is imperative to emancipate the mind, seek
truth from facts and be bold in exploring new ways, Hu said.

<HEADLINE> Diary of Party Congress Delegates (Sept. 12) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- (At Xinhua's request, some
delegates to the ongoing 15th National Congress of the Chinese
Communist Party (CPC) write what they see, discuss and think
during the congress in the form of diary, which we think will
provide outsiders with some information about this major event.
The following diary, the first of its kind, was written by Li
Zhongjie, professor of the Party School of the CPC Central
Committee -- Editor)
</P>
<P>
The word "banner" always inspires me and I believe that all
those Party members would feel the same way when they gather
under the hammer-and-sickle Party flag.
</P>
<P>
Today, the banner has again become a focus of attention at the
ongoing Party congress. In hotel rooms, or the foyer of the Great
Hall of the People, the delegates would talk about the issue of
banner when they meet each other.
</P>
<P>
I brought several of my book entitled "The Great Banner Across
the Century" here, which was published prior to the congress.
Before long, delegates and reporters who are interested in
the book came to ask for it though I didn't mention it to
anyone. Now, all the books I brought here are gone.
</P>
<P>
In the morning, Jiang Zemin delivered a report to the 2000-plus
delegates to the congress.
</P>
<P>
When Jiang said that "to adhere to Deng Xiaoping Theory means
to adhere genuinely to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought; to
hold high the banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory means to hold high
genuinely the banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought,"
all the delegates gave him a warm applause.
</P>
<P>
Why does the issue of banner draw such close attention? The
answer is just as what Jiang said in his report: "The issue of
banner is of the utmost importance. The banner represents our
orientation and image."
</P>
<P>
Following the death of Deng Xiaoping, what kind of banner to be
held and what road to take in China will determine the future and
fate of China in the 21st century, and will have a direct bearing
on the 1.2 billion Chinese people, and will also affect the
overall economic and political situation worldwide. Therefore, all
Party members and all the Chinese people have been paying close
attention to the issue of banner.
</P>
<P>
In a word, the banner represents the orientation and future
of China.
</P>
<P>
After Deng passed away last February, some China experts
overseas had the worry that China would not have a leader and
cohesion and even might be trapped in chaos.
</P>
<P>
At the opening session of the congress, Jiang clearly vowed to
hold high unswervingly the banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory. This
has shown that the CPC is consistent and firm in the fundamental
issue that determines the future and fate of China.
</P>
<P>
Holding high the banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory is the choice
of practice, the choice of the people and choice of history.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, Jiang expounded the issue in a key speech
delivered on May 29 at the Party School of the CPC Central
Committee.
</P>
<P>
I talked about my personal ideas on studying the speech in an
article in the weekly news-magazine "Outlook" as well as in my
book "The Great Banner Across the Century".
</P>
<P>
When I again heard the incisive remarks made by Jiang today, I
was deeply touched.
</P>
<P>
The Deng Xiaoping Theory is a scientific theory that is closely
connected with every Party member and every Chinese citizen.
</P>
<P>
During the new era of socialist reforms and opening-up and
modernization drive, and on the new march into the next century,
we must hold high the banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory, and use the
theory to guide our overall cause and every undetaking.

<HEADLINE> Thai Banker Warns Over Baht Volatility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The baht will remain volatile
if it does not settle in the range of 34 to 35 to the U.S. dollar,
a senior Thai bank executive warned.
</P>
<P>
The factors affecting the currency's value include the Thai
central bank's offshore swap obligations that come due over the
next 12 months, said Maleekanya Sagarik, vice-president of Union
Bank of Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
The future of the new constitution will also have an impact on
the baht, she was quoted as saying by the local newspaper The
Bangkok Post today.
</P>
<P>
Last month, foreign creditors suspended credit lines to local
businesses because they lacked confidence in the country's
economy, but Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh's pledge to
accept the new constitution softened their stand and enable the
baht to recover this week, she said.

RIO DE JANEIRO, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Some 750 state
enterprises worth a total of 130 billion U.S. dollars were

Under the program, Brazil will sell 80 billion dollars worth of
national enterprises to private ownership in the next three years.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Rupiah Recovers, Stock Price Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's rupiah recovered
from early lows against the U.S. dollar Friday as the stock
exchange lost 1.7 percent, dealers and brokers said here today.
</P>
<P>
Spot rupiah closed up at 2,930/2,936 from an opening of 2,950/
2,960 in very thin trade as most banks did not open new positions
at the weekend, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
The Jakarta stock exchange composite index, the main price
indicator on the exchange, dropped by 9.490 points to close at
546.637.
</P>
<P>
Securities dealers attributed the decline to heavy selling
pressures by foreign investors in the market.
</P>
<P>
"Most foreign investors are net sellers," a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
The government has lowered rates for the central bank's
short-term certificate (SBI) papers, but investors want it to be
lowered further and quickly, he said.
</P>
<P>
SBI is short-term rupiah-denominated obligations issued by the
central bank to drain liquidity from the market.
</P>
<P>
Local bank dealers said the central bank might cut its SBI
rates again next week.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has fallen more than 10 percent in the past month
and nearly 23 percent since January this year following offshore
speculative attacks on the currency and the rush by local
companies to hedge their foreign borrowings.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Promises Investors Big Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Trade officials of south
China's Guangdong Province, promised local foreign-funded firms
big profits if they upgrade their operations.
</P>
<P>
"If offshore companies bring in advanced technology and
equipment and improve their management, I promises they will earn
more money in the prosperous Guangdong Province," today's China
Daily quoted an official from the Provincial Commission of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation as saying.
</P>
<P>
the official made the promise after a Sino-foreign joint
venture was auctioned off early this week in Zhanjiang, a port
city in Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
The Zhanjiang Sino-American Chemical Industrial Co., Ltd, based
in Zhanjiang City on the Leizhou Peninsula, went bankrupt last
November due to poor management, and has become the first
Sino-foreign joint venture to be auctioned off this year in
Guangdong since the Auction Law was introduced, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong has established a framework for a market economy, and
encourages fair competition for both domestic and overseas
companies.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Thai Parliament Leaders Support Draft Charter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Thai Parliament President Wan
Mohammad Nor Matha and Senator Speaker Meechai Ruchuphan have
expressed their support for a move to amend the draft
constitution, but said any amendment should be made only after it
is passed by parliament.
</P>
<P>
Wan Nor said on Friday that once the new constitution is
promulgated, points that need to be changed should be changed.
</P>
<P>
Meechai also said on Friday that the draft constitution is
written somehow recklessly and there will be some problems when it
is in force.
</P>
<P>
But Meechai warned Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh's
government against attempting to amend the draft charter before
the final parliamentary vote, insisting that it should be changed
later.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit has reportedly been forced to agree to give support to
the draft constitution to avoid political conflicts in the
country, but he insisted the draft should be revised after the
parliament approves it.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers today reported that most of the parliament
members who opposed the draft charter have also agreed to pass it
late this month to avoid a tense political atmosphere in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Exports Surge in Subic, Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Export earnings of companies
based in Subic Bay, the northern Philippines, grew by 65 percent
to 349.7 million U.S. dollars in the first eight months of this
year, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Data released by the Subic Bay Management Authority showed that
in August alone, the exports revenue reached 35 million, 26
percent higher than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The data attributed the increase in export earnings to the
rising number of locators in Subic, a special economic zone
converted from a former U.S. naval base.
</P>
<P>
There are 259 foreign and local companies, mostly
export-oriented firms, that have located their projectors in
Subic. Most of these firms are now operational.

Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum was held in Subic last November.

<HEADLINE> 39 Bomb Threats Recorded in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-nine bomb threats have
been recorded in Metro Manila and the provinces recently, the
Philippine Daily Inquirer reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said at least 11 bomb threats had been recorded
in Metro Manila alone in the past two days, forcing evacuation of
government employees and prompting police to ask for the help of a
telephone company in tracing the threat callers.
</P>
<P>
The targets of the threats included the building of the
Department of Social Welfare and Development, the office of
vice-mayor of Quezon city, the Pasig City Hall and some private
buildings and schools, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Recaredo Sarmiento, director of the Philippine
National Police, as saying that those behind the rash of bomb
threats were "sadists who derive happiness in seeing our people
cower in fear."
</P>
<P>
Another high-ranking police official in Quezon city said the
bomb threats could have been sent by crime syndicates which hoped
to draw away the attention of the police from their real
objectives.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some people say the threats were made by President
Fidel Ramos' supporters who wish to give Ramos a chance to declare
martial law by sending the country into chaos.
</P>
<P>
Ramos has categorically denied that he would impose martial law
in the country while keeping anyone guessing whether he would seek
a second term next year.
</P>
<P>
Some one million people would hold a grant rally in Metro
Manila on September 21 to voice their anger over Charter change
moves seeking to extend the term of President Ramos. It was
reported that some people had threatened to bomb the rally.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine police are still investigating two blasts in
which six people were killed and 55 others wounded last week.

<HEADLINE> Farmland Reclamation Company Success In Southwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The first farmland
reclamation company in China's Guizhou province, which opened in
March in Luodian county, has succeeded in turning hillsides into
terraced fields by reclaiming nearly 32 ha of barren hillsides.
</P>
<P>
Huang Zugen, a farmer in the village of Xinyuan, bought 0.6 ha
of the improved land and said, "It really pays to buy 30-year
land-use rights at some 30,000 yuan per hectare."
</P>
<P>
The company needed to turn mountainous karst areas into
terraced land to improve farmers' lives and productive capacity,
explains Yu Xueqiang, the county's Party secretary.
</P>
<P>
The company uses four management personnel and more than 60
rural laborers for this effort and has great development potential
because the county has only 0.04 ha of farmland per capita.
</P>
<P>
The province has turned 262,000 ha of hillsides into farmland
since 1991, and needs to reclaim another 66,000 ha of wasteland to
meet farmers' needs.
</P>
<P>
The company has provided an example for the rest of the
province in opening up land in a particular, market-oriented way.
