<HEADLINE> Rochester's pro soccer team aiming to build 20,000-seat stadium  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - The minor-league darlings of U.S. soccer are
gearing up to build a 20,000-seat stadium.
<P>
	   The Rochester Raging Rhinos, winners of the nation's top soccer cup last
fall, promised Tuesday to contribute $25.7 million in private funds toward
building a $44.1 million, soccer-specific stadium by 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   The project's success hinges on the ability of the A-League team's three
co-owners to persuade state, county and city governments to come up with the
balance - $18.4 million.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're willing to risk all of our money to make this a done deal," said
Rhinos president Frank DuRoss. "We need to convince the government officials
that this project has legs, that it's a good investment in the community."
</P>
<P>
	   The Rhinos are by far the biggest draw in professional soccer's second
division A-League with an average attendance of 11,551 last season. They are
campaigning to gain a slot in Major League Soccer, which is aiming to expand
from 12 to 14 teams by next year.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, the stumbling block has been the Rhinos' home ground. Since their
inaugural year in 1996, they have played at 12,052-seat Frontier Field, a
seashell-shaped stadium built that year for minor league baseball's Rochester
Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
	   For the MLS to invite them aboard, the Rhinos first need to build a
soccer-specific stadium with a capacity of at least 20,000 that would triple
their market to about 3 million by drawing fans from Syracuse, 75 miles east of
here, and Buffalo, 60 miles to the west.
</P>
<P>
	   Team officials unveiled architectural designs for a rectangular stadium they
expect to start building this summer to open for the 2001 season. They said they
have honed in on four possible sites - one near Frontier Field and the others in
the Rochester suburbs.
</P>
<P>
	   The stadium would be designed to play host to other sports, such as
lacrosse, field hockey, football and rugby, and also be used to stage music
concerts and various community events.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed stadium would be used for A-League competition if the Rhinos
don't win a place in the MLS, but DuRoss said the team's survival is at stake.
</P>
<P>
	   Without government help, he said, "we'd have to reevaluate where we're at
and how we could survive in this marketplace without our own stadium."
</P>
<P>
	   By contrast, success on the field has seemed easy to come by. The 1998
A-League champion Rhinos toppled the Colorado Rapids 2-0 in September to become
the first A-League team to win the U.S. Open Cup since MLS teams entered the
premier cup competition in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Missing snow is blessing for some, curse for others in upstate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - Kelly Underwood figured he had a can't-miss idea.
Living in America's snowiest big city, Underwood thought he could make some
extra cash during the winter by starting a part-time plowing business.
<P>
	   What he didn't figure on was a finicky Mother Nature, which has left upstate
New York wondering where winter is.
</P>
<P>
	   "I started last year, and of course, last year wasn't so great. But this
year has really been pathetic," Underwood said Tuesday as he watched the rain
fall on his bare driveway while temperatures hovered in the mid-40s.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm still struggling to get my bills paid," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Underwood said he's been out plowing just twice so far this winter.
</P>
<P>
	   That's not surprising because Syracuse, which averages 115 inches of snow,
has received just 20 inches of snow - nearly 30 inches below normal, according
to the Northeast Regional Climate Center at Cornell University. Last year,
Syracuse received 98 inches of snow.
</P>
<P>
	   It's the same story across upstate. With a paltry 1.6 inches of snow, Albany
is experiencing its least snowiest winter to date in 50 years; Buffalo is seeing
the second least snowiest winter in that span with just under 14 inches, about
28 inches less than usual.
</P>
<P>
	   Even upstate's Tug Hill region along eastern Lake Ontario - the snowiest
area east of the Rockies with an annual average of 220 inches - is virtually
snowless.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have a little bit of snow in some spots but we're hurting, too," said
Bob Quinn, a director with the Tug Hill Commission. "This is highly, highly
unusual for us. Everybody up here is talking about the lack of snow."
</P>
<P>
	   Because the Tug Hill is a winter recreation paradise for skiers and
snowmobilers who come by the thousands from all over the Northeast and Canada,
no snow means no money for the small local businesses that cater to them.
</P>
<P>
	   "A situation like this has an immediate and critical impact," Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
	   Blame the lack of snow partially on La Nina - the cooling of ocean
temperatures in the Pacific Ocean near Peru that alters storms tracks in the
Northeast. Blame it partially on global warming.
</P>
<P>
	   "They are contributing factors but weather is a cyclical event," said Keith
Eggleston, a climatologist at Cornell. "Don't worry. It all averages out. The
snow will come."
</P>
<P>
	   Upstate New York experienced a similar snow drought last winter when it
didn't receive its first substantial snowfall until late December. Then Old Man
Winter arrived with a vengeance. A series of lake effect storms during the first
two weeks of January hit Buffalo with 60 inches of snow over two weeks. In
March, another wintry blast piled 41 inches of snow on Rochester in a three-day
period.
</P>
<P>
	   Syracuse Public Works Commissioner Anthony Ilacquia has lived upstate long
enough to know winter can return from one day to the next. He noted that
forecasters were predicting colder temperatures and snow showers for later in
the week.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have 10 weeks of winter left and January and February are typically the
heaviest snow months. I can tell you we're not taking off the plows just yet,"
Ilacquia said.
</P>
<P>
	   Although they haven't had any snow to remove from the city's streets,
Ilacquia's crews have remained busy, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's actually a blessing to us. It lets us catch up with other things,
repairing our vehicles, keeping our fleet in good shape, repairing pot holes,
picking up Christmas trees. In a typical year, we put these things off," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Others, too, were making good use of winter's absence.
</P>
<P>
	   The Liverpool Golf and Public Country Club remained open Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I feel bad for the skiers but this is beautiful," said owner Rich Ajemian,
who estimated he's had close to 100 golfers daily during the warm, snowless
spell. "Heck, there's even a threesome out there today playing in the rain."
</P>
<P>
	   John Petrocci, a designer with Valley Grove Landscaping in Clay, said his
company was taking advantage of the weather.
</P>
<P>
	   "In this business, we're lucky if we get to the second week of December.
This has extended our working season by a month," Petrocci said.
</P>
<P>
	   Then there are those whose livelihoods depend on the snow and cold weather.
They aren't happy.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'd like to see a change in the weather. It's been so bleak," said Kerry
Metivier, the business marketing director at West Mountain Ski Area, located 30
miles north of Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we didn't have snow-making machines we wouldn't be open," said Jane
Eshbaugh, spokeswoman for Holiday Valley Resort in Ellicottville in western New
York.

<HEADLINE> Pataki calls for a $77 billion state budget for fiscal 2000-01  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Almost everyone who matters politically in Albany
said they liked something they heard in Gov. George Pataki's 2000-01 state
budget proposal.
<P>
	   In fact, Democrats and Republicans alike said Tuesday they either thought of
the ideas first or have been promoting them for years.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican leader in the state Assembly, John Faso, said Pataki's
proposed elimination of the gross receipts tax on utility bills, the governor's
debt reform ideas and his economic development plans "closely mirror" those of
his GOP Assembly members.
</P>
<P>
	   Ditto, said the leader of the Democrats in the state Senate, Martin Connor.
He said the gross receipts tax rescinder and economic development proposals
targeted to upstate New York are things Senate Democrats have been talking about
for years.
</P>
<P>
	   Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, praised the Republican governor
for no longer talking about cuts in areas the Democrats have defended in
Pataki's past budgets - tuition at state colleges, for instance, and Medicaid
programs that aid hospitals and poor families. Silver also said the Pataki
proposals to rein in state debt, including a provision to no longer allow
borrowing not approved beforehand by voters, are things his chamber has also
advocated.
</P>
<P>
	   And the Republican leader of the state Senate, Joseph Bruno, said debt
reform, the gross receipts tax rescinder and upstate economic development
programs have all been talked about for years in his house.
</P>
<P>
	   A nearly $77 billion budget would be 5.5 percent larger than the current
fiscal-year spending plan. Pataki conceded that would be more than the projected
inflation rate for the next year, but he said the numbers are skewed by the
inclusion of $2 billion in rebates due property taxpayers in fiscal 2000-01
under the "STAR" program.
</P>
<P>
	   Those rebates are classified as state spending when they really are not,
Pataki argued.
</P>
<P>
	   A better gauge, the governor said, is the proposed size of the state's
general fund - $37.9 billion. That fund is comprised of money generated through
state taxes and fees. Pataki said it would grow by only 2.3 percent in fiscal
2000-01, or by less than the expected inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have a budget this year which I think is just a great budget," Pataki
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The anti-tax group Change-New York wasn't so sure. It said by starting
budget negotiations with the Legislature at a "disturbingly high" platform of a
5.5 percent budget increase, lawmakers are essentially being invited to go
significantly higher in the budget they finally adopt.
</P>
<P>
	   "Overall, this proposed budget is a major disappointment," Change-New York
President Tom Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic state Comptroller H. Carl McCall quibbled with Pataki's numbers.
He said the governor was putting "off budget" some funds which will probably be
spent, meaning that the governor's reckoning that general fund spending would be
below the inflation rate is an illusion.
</P>
<P>
	   "I awaited this budget with high expectation," said McCall, who may end up
challenging Pataki for the governorship in 2002. "In his State of the State
address, the governor made encouraging statements on his plans to focus on
improving education in our state. But I'm disappointed that his budget actions
don't live up to his State of the State words."
</P>
<P>
	   Silver argued that by not rolling over unspent school dollars into the next
state budget from the current fiscal year, Pataki would actually spend nearly
$900 million less on education in fiscal 2000-01, not $355 million more as the
governor said he was proposing.
</P>
<P>
	   "The governor has chosen to break faith with local school districts by
cutting funding and reneging on commitments he's already made," the chairman of
the Assembly's education committee, Manhattan Democrat Steven Sanders, said.
</P>
<P>
	   State School Boards Association Executive Director Timothy Kremer called a
$355 million funding increase a "drop in the bucket" compared to the commitments
districts must meet.
</P>
<P>
	   On the other hand, Pataki received mostly praise from what was a critical
quarter during his previous five budgets as governor - higher education.
</P>
<P>
	   He proposed spending $75 million more on the State University of New York
and $19 million on the City University of New York systems and did not advocate
any tuition increases in the 2000-01 academic year.
</P>
<P>
	   "A huge boost for the State University," said SUNY Chancellor Robert King,
who was Pataki's budget director until late last month. CUNY Chancellor Matthew
Goldstein said he was "encouraged and pleased" by Pataki's proposal. Goldstein
was nominated by Pataki to the SUNY chancellorship last summer.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the next several weeks, legislators and their analysts will pore over
Pataki's proposal and hold budget hearings before each chamber will formulate
changes. It has been 16 years since lawmakers and the governor completed passage
on a new state budget prior to the April 1 deadline.

<HEADLINE> The chances suddenly aren't so bad for an on-time budget  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - New York's 15-year-old streak of failing to pass the
state budget on time might end this year, politicians predicted after seeing
Gov. George Pataki's latest budget proposal.
<P>
	   "All the pieces of the puzzle are in the right place to pass an on-time
budget this year," said Republican state Sen. Nicholas Spano of Westchester
County.
</P>
<P>
	   The main culprits behind the most recent five overdue budgets - Pataki,
Republican Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno and Democratic Assembly Speaker
Sheldon Silver - all insist that this is the year for a change.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, the budget wasn't finished until Aug. 4, only hours before it
would have become the latest budget in state history. State budget are supposed
to be enacted by April 1, the beginning of the state's fiscal year, but there
are no penalties for the Legislature and governor for failing to do so.
</P>
<P>
	   Some people don't think the leaders will succeed in being on time in 2000,
either.
</P>
<P>
	   "If I had a ranch, I wouldn't bet it," said Blair Horner of the New York
Public Interest Research Group.
</P>
<P>
	   But the politicians all said Tuesday there's reason for real hope this year.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you look at this budget, I think it's a very sound budget and I would
hope the Legislature would not feel the need to make any dramatic changes,"
Pataki said. "And if that's the case, there's no reason why the changes that
they produce shouldn't and can't be made in an open and prompt manner and I
would hope that will be the case."
</P>
<P>
	   When reminded by a reporter that he says that every year, Pataki added: "I
feel more so this year."
</P>
<P>
	   Silver and Bruno did agree that Pataki has given them a better place to
start from with his budget proposal Tuesday. They say it will allow them to come
to an end product faster.
</P>
<P>
	   "I believe it should," Silver said. "It certainly has a better foundation."
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki proposed Tuesday that New York spend nearly $78 billion in its next
fiscal year, 5.5 percent more than the current fiscal-year spending plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno agreed with Silver's assessment of an on-time budget's chances.
</P>
<P>
	   "The governor has established a pretty good base," Bruno said. "I think this
year will be better than other years."
</P>
<P>
	   Of course, this is also an election year for the Senate and the Assembly.
The quicker they finish the budget, the quicker they get home and start raising
money full-time and campaigning for re-election.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, the budget was finished on April 14 in 1998, the last time the
Legislature was up for re-election. Legislators have never gone past July 13
without a budget in an election year.
</P>
<P>
	   "And this is a uniquely important election," Horner pointed out.
</P>
<P>
	   The 2002 Legislature will decide how to redistrict the state after the 2000
Census and the advantage in redistricting goes to the party that controls the
Assembly and Senate chambers.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Legislature that's in power in 2002 will be the Legislature who will be
in power for the next 10 years," Horner said. "They'll want to get out of Dodge
and get home as soon as they can."
</P>
<P>
	   The budget process has not changed. Bruno last week suggested ending the
"three men in a room" approach under which Pataki, Silver and Bruno meet
privately and agree to key aspects of budgets. Pataki and Silver would not
immediately commit to it Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of going home for good for the rest of the year after finishing the
budget last August, the Legislature returned to Albany several times to hash out
the Health Care Reform Act, New York's one-of-a-kind subsidy system to fund
cash-shy aspects of the health care industry.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of the HCRA deal, Pataki and the Legislature agreed to a three-year
continuation of Medicaid cost containment programs worth about $1 billion a
year. Cost containment has been at the center of budget battles for years.
</P>
<P>
	   "It think that was a very, very important part of HCRA," Pataki said. "It
doesn't just make this year's budget process easier, it makes the budget process
easier for the next three years because that, last year, was probably the most
difficult issue, whether or not to continue the cost containment and that is now
resolved."
</P>
<P>
	   However, it won't be completely smooth sailing this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno and Silver both criticized Pataki's education proposal. Pataki called
for $12.9 billion for education, a record amount. But Silver and Bruno both want
more, pointing out that the governor is not seeking to continue funding certain
programs.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the things that were left out included class-size reductions,
pre-kindergarten programs and increased teacher salaries, Silver said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think the members of the conference will take those education cuts
lightly," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno was more charitable. "Now is not the time to cut back on our support
for secondary education," he said.

<HEADLINE> Mugger makes high wire escape in pizza deliverer's outfit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - In a chase straight out of the movies, a quick-thinking
mugger being pursued by police ran into an office building and leaped from a
19th-floor window to the building next door, where he stole a pizza deliverer's
hat and apron and calmly vanished out the front door.
<P>
	   It all started when police responded to a call about a street robbery at
59th Street and Park Avenue around 11:45 a.m. Tuesday. Officers chased the
suspect to East 53rd Street, where he ran into the Banco Santander office
building.
</P>
<P>
	   As if following a scriptwriter's cue, the elevator doors opened; the suspect
jumped in; the doors closed. He arrived at the 19th floor a step ahead of
police, who had to take another elevator.
</P>
<P>
	   Before police could catch up with him, he had darted through an office and
jumped out the window.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses thought he had plummeted to his death. But instead he landed on a
window air conditioner at the office building next door.
</P>
<P>
	   It was unclear how many floors the man fell before grabbing the air
conditioner, but the space between the buildings is about 10 feet wide, and a
few floors below where he jumped, the two structures join.
</P>
<P>
	   Police didn't know right away that he had landed unscathed and crawled
through the window into the neighboring building.
</P>
<P>
	   There, he encountered a delivery man from the Checkerboard Gourmet deli. The
thief took the delivery man's hat and apron and put them on in the elevator; he
emerged in the lobby disguised as the delivery man and sauntered out of the
building.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't think anything of it. He just looked like your ordinary delivery
guy," said a security guard at the second building. "We thought all the action
was next door."
</P>
<P>
	   Afterward, the scene at Checkerboard was business as usual as the workers
coped with the lunch rush.
</P>
<P>
	   "The guy grabbed my delivery man's hat and apron. He scared the hell out of
him," said Checkerboard manager Seth Novak.
</P>
<P>
	   The delivery man, who would only give his name as Salvador, declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Police Deputy Inspector Donald Feser admitted: "This was not your usual
occurrence."

<HEADLINE> Send Elian back to Cuba, protesters say  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - By allowing Elian Gonzalez to remain in Miami instead of
sending him back to his father in Cuba, the United States has earned the
disrespect of the entire world, former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark said.
<P>
	   "He belongs with his father, his grandparents, in Cuba," said Clark, one of
several speakers at a rally Tuesday calling for the 6-year-old boy's return to
his native country.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we care about family at all, we really need to return him to Cuba,"
Clark said.
</P>
<P>
	   After the 20-minute rally, marred by a blustery wind, in front of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service building here, 11 people - including a
69-year-old blind man - were arrested for blocking the entrance and charged with
disorderly conduct. Clark was not arrested.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was rescued from an inner tube off the coast of Florida on
Thanksgiving Day, after a shipwreck that killed his mother, stepfather and
others fleeing Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy has been staying with his great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, and other
relatives in Miami. Last week, the INS ruled that Elian should be returned to
his father's custody. But on Monday, Miami-Dade County Circuit Judge Rosa
Rodriguez ruled that Elian should remain with his U.S. relatives until March 6
so the court can hear arguments from his great-uncle, who is seeking temporary
custody.
</P>
<P>
	   The case has touched off protests in Miami and in Cuba, where Fidel Castro's
government condemned Tuesday's ruling. Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, has
demanded that his son be returned.
</P>
<P>
	   The roughly 50 people protesting Tuesday in New York, most belonging to a
group called The Committee to Demand the Return of Elian to his Father in Cuba,
agree with the boy's father.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwin Lewinson, a professor emeritus of history at Seton Hall University,
was among the handful placed in plastic handcuffs and carted off in an NYPD van
for booking. Lewinson, who is blind, gave his seeing eye dog, Hooper, a golden
retriever, to a friend before boarding the van.
</P>
<P>
	   "I feel that this is a violation of international law to keep Elian in the
United States," said Lewinson, who has been arrested several times for taking
part in demonstrations. "If he had come from any other country he probably would
have been sent back immediately."
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Luis Barrios, who teaches child psychology at John Jay College of
Criminal Justice, said he was concerned with Elian's psychological welfare.
</P>
<P>
	   "Elian has been given toys, a puppy, but people here aren't concerned for
him," Barrios said. "This is a political game."
</P>
<P>
	   Similar rallies and acts of civil disobedience were slated to be held
nationwide through Thursday, organizers said.

<HEADLINE> Cardinal's birthday dinner raises $4 million for charity  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Cardinal John O'Connor's birthday party is turning into
a major fund-raiser for the New York Archdiocese.
<P>
	   The dinner, scheduled for Saturday, when the cardinal turns 80, has raised
$4 million for education and other Catholic charities.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's been one of his top priorities, to help preserve Catholic education
in the archdiocese, so part of the money from this will go to that," said
O'Connor's spokesman Joe Zwilling.
</P>
<P>
	   Between 1,400 and 1,500 people are expected to attend the event at the
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel honoring the cardinal's legacy.
</P>
<P>
	   Tickets were $1,000 a head but many of the guests made additional
contributions, Zwilling said.
</P>
<P>
	   Proceeds from the dinner will also be used to fund a seminary position named
for the cardinal. The John Cardinal O'Connor Distinguished Chair in Hebrew
Studies at St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers, is designed to educate future
priests about the shared scriptural heritage of Jews and Christians.
</P>
<P>
	   Tributes to the cardinal and a video about his legacy are planned for the
dinner.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the clergy expected to attend are seven cardinals, six archbishops and
a number of bishops from around the country. The guest list includes some of the
men who have been mentioned as possible successors to O'Connor, including
Archbishop Justin Rigali of St. Louis; Archbishop Edwin O'Brien, who heads the
archdiocese for the U.S. military; and Bishop Henry Mansell of Buffalo, a former
top aide to O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the clergy are expected to be present when O'Connor presides over
Mass the next day at St. Patrick's Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
	   The cardinal had a brain tumor removed in September and has missed a number
of public appearances, including Masses, since then.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Connor has hinted that he expects to be replaced soon by the pope. He
offered his resignation on his 75th birthday as the church requires but it was
not accepted then. Cardinals lose their power to vote for a new pope when they
turn 80, which has led to speculation that his resignation could be accepted
soon.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Connor is the oldest active bishop in the United States and as leader of
the New York Archdiocese's flock of 2.4 million, he is regarded as one of the
most powerful Catholics in America.

<HEADLINE> Appeals court balks at city lawyer's 'Sensation' claims  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - An appeals judge showed skepticism toward the city's
plans to kick the Brooklyn Museum out of its building because it refused to
withdraw the controversial "Sensation" art exhibit the city found inappropriate
for children.
<P>
	   "Is every book in the New York Public Library appropriate for school
children?" Justice Jon Newman asked city lawyer Leonard Koerner. "Is the library
next?"
</P>
<P>
	   Koerner said the city would not attack the library for the content of its
books but would consider action if it housed an exhibit celebrating the Klu Klux
Klan or homophobia.
</P>
<P>
	   The exchange occurred during arguments Tuesday before the 2nd U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals stemming from the holiday controversy that featured Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani in another clash with advocates of the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
	   Repeatedly in recent years, the mayor has fought in federal court over the
issue of how strictly the city can regulate demonstrations and other speech
governed by the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
	   This time, Koerner sought to distance the city from the First Amendment
issues at stake.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is not a First Amendment case, your honor," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It isn't?" snapped Justice John Walker.
</P>
<P>
	   Newman called the statement possibly "the most extraordinary thing" he had
heard from the city.
</P>
<P>
	   The judges reserved decision. They must consider whether to uphold a federal
judge's ruling in Brooklyn that found the city's decision to freeze its $7.2
million annual contribution to the museum violated the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
	   They also must determine whether the case belongs in state court rather than
federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani vowed to cut off the funding after a controversy erupted over the
exhibit, titled "Sensation: Young British Artists From the Saatchi Collection."
</P>
<P>
	   Various groups had protested to the mayor about a Chris Ofili painting, "The
Holy Virgin Mary," which depicts Mary with African features and includes a
shellacked clump of elephant dung and magazine cutouts of female genitalia.
</P>
<P>
	   The show opened on Oct. 2 and closed on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Koerner had barely begun delivering his argument before the appeals court
panel when he faced a barrage of fast questions from Newman.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge asked why the city had begun what amounted to eviction
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
	   "Is it really the city's position that the Brooklyn Museum should take its
entire collection out of that building now?" Newman asked. "Your words and your
complaint say so, but I'm not sure you mean it."
</P>
<P>
	   Koerner conceded that the city would like to negotiate a solution with the
museum but only after a judge had found in its favor. At the very least, he
said, the city would like to stop funding the museum.
</P>
<P>
	   Museum attorney Floyd Abrams said the city wanted only to punish the museum
for its exhibit, ruining a 100-year relationship that included numerous
accolades from the city heralding the museum as one of the best in the world.
</P>
<P>
	   Abrams said even the notion that an eviction would force the museum to move
to California or to New Jersey was "so bizarre that it is a basis for
considering that this whole thing is nothing more than an effort to punish."
</P>
<P>
	   "We funded this museum," Koerner said. "Let's assume that it celebrated the
Klu Klux Klan or the Holocaust or homophobia. I don't think the court would be
saying we'd be required to fund it."
</P>
<P>
	   "Don't be so sure," Newman said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 44.98; Nasdaq Down 67.87  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in early trading today as investors
worried that reports due for release later this week will indicate that the
economy is growing fast enough to warrant more interest-rate increases by the
Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 44.98 at 11,556.06
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
down 7.82 at 1,430.74, and the Nasdaq composite index was down 67.87 at
3,853.32.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks struggled as the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose to 6.69
percent, the highest level since Sept. 11, 1997. Bond investors have been highly
sensitive to growing fears that the Fed will raise interest rates at its next
meeting on Feb. 1 and 2, and may impose further hikes later in the year to keep
inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
	   Higher interest rates can hurt stocks by cutting into corporate profits as
it becomes more expensive to borrow money. Also, rising bond yields can attract
investors away from stocks by offering lucrative, stable returns.
</P>
<P>
	   The next barometers of economic growth will come on Thursday, when the
government reports on producer prices for December, as well as retail sales. On
Friday, the Labor Department will release its Consumer Price Index, a widely
watched gauge of inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks were mostly lower today. Yahoo! fell 24 5/8 to 372 3/4 a
day after posting a better-than-expected profit report. Yahoo! said late Tuesday
it earned 19 cents per share in the fourth quarter, above Wall Street's
prediction of 15 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
	   But company officials warned in a conference call that Yahoo!'s strong
revenue growth is not sustainable, and that prompted investors to sell shares
today.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, Microsoft fell 2 7/8 to 106 1/2 and Oracle fell 3 9/16 to 108 13/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 126.63 million shares, behind Monday's
early pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 2.53 to 490.08.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.0 percent. In afternoon
trading, Germany's Xetra DAX index was down 0.3 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was
down .01 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 0.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> Studios Buy Mann Theatres Chain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A partnership owned by the Warner Bros. and Paramount
studios has acquired the defunct Mann Theatres chain after a bankruptcy court
approved a $91 million sale agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   The theater chain's parent company, WestStar Cinemas Inc., had filed for
bankruptcy protection last year.
</P>
<P>
	   WestStar agreed to sell the chain to WF Cinema Holdings, a partnership
between Warner Bros. and Paramount, but the bankruptcy court ordered the sale
opened up to competitive bids.
</P>
<P>
	   However, no other companies bid on the 351-screen chain, and the previous
agreement was approved Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner Bros. spokeswoman Barbara Brogliatti told the Daily News of Los
Angeles that the court process was "fairly routine."
</P>
<P>
	   Under terms of the deal, WF Cinema must pay WestStar $46 million immediately
and an additional $45 million by Oct. 15, according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
	   Encino-based WestStar operates 53 Mann Theatres in Colorado and California,
including the landmark Mann's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 70.73; Nasdaq Down 27.71  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today as investors continued moving money
away from pricey technology shares and toward blue-chip industrials that perform
well when the economy is growing.
</P>
<P>
	   In morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up
70.73 at 11,581.81, above its closing record of 11,572.20 set on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
down 1.10 at 1,437.46, and the Nasdaq composite index was off 27.71 at 3,893.48.
</P>
<P>
	   Yahoo! led a decline in technology stocks. Shares of the Internet service
provider fell 18 49/64 to 378 39/64 a day after the company posted a
better-than-expected profit report. Yahoo! said late Tuesday it earned 19 cents
per share in the fourth quarter, above Wall Street's prediction of 15 cents per
share.
</P>
<P>
	   But company officials warned in a conference call that Yahoo!'s strong

</P>
<P>
	   Also, Microsoft fell 2 13/16 to 106 9/16 and Oracle fell 2 3/8 to 110.
</P>
<P>
	   With technology stocks slipping, investors once again sought out relative
bargains in the industrial and consumer goods sectors. After lagging behind the
high-flying Nasdaq in the second half of 1999, the Dow Jones industrials have
outstripped other market measures so far this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, 3M rose 2 1/8 to 102 5/8, and Merck rose 1 11/16 to 74 15/16.
</P>
<P>
	   The broadening of the market has created a healthier environment for
investors, many analysts believe.
</P>
<P>
	   "Breadth has improved dramatically this year," said Gregory Nie, technical
analyst at First Union Securities in Chicago. "This market has a good enough,
healthy enough underpinning to support a real rally."
</P>
<P>
	   Still, stocks may struggle in the next two sessions as investors await the
next round of economic indicators. On Thursday, the government will report on
producer prices for December, as well as retail sales. On Friday, the Labor
Department will release its Consumer Price Index, a widely watched gauge of
inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   The reports should offer some indication of the Federal Reserve's next move
on interest rates. Many analysts believe the Fed will raise rates at its next
meeting on Feb. 1 and 2, and may impose further hikes later in the year to keep
inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
	   Higher interest rates can hurt stocks by cutting into corporate profits as
it becomes more expensive to borrow money.
</P>
<P>
	   Bond investors, highly sensitive to inflation and short-term rate changes,
today sent the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond to 6.68 percent from 6.67
percent late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 303.61 million shares, behind Monday's
early pace.

<HEADLINE> Books and Authors: C.B. Wolford  </HEADLINE>
    By KIMBERLY HEFLING Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHELPS, Ky. (AP) -- Even when it was clear that he was dying, 13-year-old
C.B. Wolford pressed on, hoping to finish a journal to help inspire other kids
with cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   After his death, his family completed the task.
</P>
<P>
	   "My Story About Cancer," by Charles B. Wolford with Faye Wolford, was
published posthumously this month and is about C.B.'s battle with Ewing's
Sarcoma.
</P>
<P>
	   "He wanted to let other kids and other families know what we had been
through and that we were just normal people," says C.B.'s mother, Faye. "He
loved everybody and everybody loved him."
</P>
<P>
	   C.B. wrote his story on a laptop computer provided by the Make-A-Wish
Foundation while he was being treated for a rare form of cancer that starts in
the bones. Although it was only 14 months from the time he was diagnosed to his
death on Oct. 28, 1998, he touched many people -- including President Clinton --
with his endearing personality.
</P>
<P>
	   With much candor, C.B. talks in his book about his treatments and disease,
and gives readers a glimpse of his inner thoughts and fears.
</P>
<P>
	   In one excerpt, he writes:
</P>
<P>
	   "Sometimes I cry myself to sleep. I wonder, why me? Why did it have to
happen to me? But I guess I am just as good a choice as anybody. If it hadn't
happened to me, it would have happened to somebody else.
</P>
<P>
	   "You just have to keep your faith. That's what's kept me hanging on. Maybe I
will get better and everything will go back to normal."
</P>
<P>
	   Scattered throughout the book are pictures of C.B. with his family and some
of the celebrities he met, including Clinton, Cleveland Browns quarterback Tim
Couch and country singer John Michael Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
	   The book also contains chapters by his mother, his father Ballard and
younger brother Eddie, now 13. Their excerpts complete the story. They also fill
in when C.B. is too sick to write any more.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Wolford tells about C.B.'s trip to the White House two weeks before his
death, where he met Clinton and played with the president's dog, Buddy.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's eyes welled with tears when C.B. asked him for assistance to pay
for a bowel transplant for a local teacher and for more funding for cancer
research for children, Mrs. Wolford writes.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wish I had met you a long time ago," the president told C.B. "There
aren't many people in the world that think the way you do."
</P>
<P>
	   Although it was hard to write about C.B.'s last months, Mrs. Wolford said
she wanted to help others. One story she shares in the book is about the time
when C.B. -- too sick to talk -- scribbled on a piece of paper to his father:
"How is Momma?"
</P>
<P>
	   "I can't even believe he was mine," she says, then pauses, "but he wasn't.
God loaned him to me for 13 years, then he took the little angel home."
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Jeffrey A. Moscow, one of C.B.'s doctors who wrote the forward to the
book, said he believes C.B.'s story provides a glimpse at childhood cancer that
will be beneficial for caregivers.
</P>
<P>
	   "When you read the book, you can understand the joy and you can certainly
feel the pain," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Moscow said he is especially glad that Eddie was included in the book. "A
lot of times the parents focus on the child who is going through it and the
people who it is often most difficult for are the siblings," the doctor said.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite having separate rooms, the two brothers often slept in the same bed
because they were so close.
</P>
<P>
	   "I miss him a lot," said Eddie, who had such bad sympathy pains in his leg
after C.B.'s death that his parents feared he might also have cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   Married at 14 and a mother to C.B. at 17, Mrs. Wolford said she felt like
she grew up with the two boys. "He was my best friend," she said of C.B.
</P>
<P>
	   After C.B.'s death, Mrs. Wolford wondered if the book would ever be
published until she received a call one day from James Riordan, publisher of the
Santa Ana, Calif.-based Seven Locks Press.
</P>
<P>
	   Riordan had read about C.B. in a local newspaper and wanted to publish his
story. The book was released with an initial run of 1,000. All royalties will go
into a fund to pay for Eddie's college education.
</P>
<P>
	   The book's cover shows C.B. wearing a University of Kentucky T-shirt just a
few weeks before he died. Although thin, he's smiling and looks like a healthy
teen-ager. But in reality, C.B. threw up several times on the way to his photo
shoot, and could barely hold his head up for the picture, Mrs. Wolford said.
</P>
<P>
	   After all C.B. went through and did for others, Mrs. Wolford said she
doesn't want her son forgotten.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have met a lot of people, and if I have not mentioned their names, it
does not mean that I don't think about them or remember what they have done for
me," C.B. writes at the end of his journal. "I am very grateful and I love each
and every one of them. May God bless everybody, and I thank him for letting me
into your life -- and you into mine.
</P>
<P>
	   "Always remember me in your prayers."

<HEADLINE> Books and Authors: Mrs. Pickle  </HEADLINE>
    By STEVE BRISENDINE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MISSION, Kan. (AP) -- Mrs. Pickle is crazy for cornichons, ga-ga for
gherkins, daft for dills.
</P>
<P>
	   The title character in "Picky Mrs. Pickle," illustrator Christine
Schneider's first foray into children's writing, is a woman who knows what she
likes.
</P>
<P>
	   She'll only eat pickles and pickle-flavored foods -- like pickle parfait ice
cream and pickle soup.
</P>
<P>
	   Clothing? It's got to be green. Ditto her furnishings and even the sweaters
her poodle, Dill, wears. And when she goes out, it's with a spritz of "Eau de
Pickle No. 19" behind her ears.
</P>
<P>
	   The inspiration for parts of that character is as close as the nearest
mirror, Schneider said -- although she doesn't own any green shoes.
</P>
<P>
	   "Pickles are definitely a love of mine," she said. "And I have a tendency
sometimes to be a bit picky. So some of that does come from me. But otherwise
she was a character that just kind of sprung from the story."
</P>
<P>
	   As anyone knows, an object in a rut remains in a rut unless acted upon by an
outside force. In this case, it's Mrs. Pickle's youngest niece, Sophie Claire.
</P>
<P>
	   All the other relatives are resigned to Mrs. Pickle's carved-in-cucumber
ways, but not Sophie Claire. Each week, when the two stop by Igor's Ice Cream
Stand, she urges her aunt to try something new -- tomato, perhaps, or eggplant.
</P>
<P>
	   If that produces a nose-wrinkling reaction from a young audience hearing the
book, Schneider said, so much the better.
</P>
<P>
	   "When I'm doing a reading for kids, I try to provoke that as much as I can,"
she said. "I'll even throw in an extra 'ewwwwwwwwww."'
</P>
<P>
	   The book, while written for children, contains a few in-jokes that older
readers will recognize. For example, Mrs. Pickle's favorite brand is "Pete's" --
from the tongue twister about Peter Piper.
</P>
<P>
	   There are a few puns that are a little bit older humor," Schneider said.
"That gives the parents something to enjoy when they're reading the book. But
you'd be surprised -- some of the kids get that, too."
</P>
<P>
	   And often, people see their friends or family members in either Mrs. Pickle
or Sophie Claire.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's always somebody in the crowd who's extremely picky," Schneider
said. "Or people will say, 'This is perfect for my niece or my mother."'
</P>
<P>
	   Schneider, 28, graduated from the University of Kansas, where she studied
under children's illustrator Thomas B. Allen. In her first foray into children's
books, she did the illustrations for "Jeremy's Muffler," by Laura F. Nielsen.
</P>
<P>
	   But, she said, doing "Picky Mrs. Pickle" was "much more rewarding at the
end. I felt like it was one package. I could get in everything I had intended
for the book, because I could work back and forth between the story and the
pictures."
</P>
<P>
	   Even though it was her first experience writing a book, Schneider said she
still concentrated most on the illustrations.
</P>
<P>
	   "In a picture book, it's very important what the pictures do for the story,
because there aren't a lot of words," she said. "Depending on what age you're
talking about, some kids are going to rely on pictures more than words."
</P>
<P>
	   The whole process, start to finish, took about 18 months -- seemingly a long
time, until you take a look at the illustrations.
</P>
<P>
	   They're not the simple, primary-color drawings of the children's books you
read growing up. Instead, each page is saturated with rich greens (of course),
golds and purples.
</P>
<P>
	   "It takes me about 40 hours to do one illustration," Schneider said. "I was
working a job at the same time, and was doing that pretty much at night. So
that's why it took me so long."
</P>
<P>
	   Now, writing and illustrating are a full-time job.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sometimes it's a little nerve-wracking, but I can't think of anything else
I'd rather be doing," she said. "It's a pretty wonderful job to have, because I
get to tell stories and draw pictures at the same time."
</P>
<P>
	   Schneider's next book is due out in fall 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm working on the revisions to the story right now," she said. "It doesn't
have a title yet, but it's basically about a magician. I think that's probably
enough to tell you right now."

<HEADLINE> Whiz Filmmaker Plows Familiar Ground  </HEADLINE>
    By MARK KENNEDY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The next one, Paul Thomas Anderson insists, won't be about
families.
</P>
<P>
	   Maybe he'll make a war flick. Perhaps he'll make a silly little comedy.
Maybe it'll be set in space.
</P>
<P>
	   Just not another movie about families -- please.
</P>
<P>
	   "Enough with the family topic!" the 29-year-old filmmaker bellows even as
"Magnolia," his third consecutive examination of dysfunctional families, earns
rave reviews.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it might be tapped out at this point," he says, mournfully. "I
think my gut wants to take a right-hand turn. Let's go make a funny movie! With
explosions!"
</P>
<P>
	   Trouble is, Anderson doesn't believe it.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm sure I'll set out to write something, you know, like about a war or
something, and it'll end up being about a family. Every time!" he says. "It
always goes back to stories about, "OK, this is a son and his father..."'
</P>
<P>
	   Even his friends doubt Anderson's next film will escape the pattern.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm sure it'll be another ode on the same," laughs JoAnne Sellar, who
helped produce "Magnolia." "If he was doing a space odyssey, it would still come
back to the family."
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson, reluctantly, agrees.
</P>
<P>
	   "Yeah, I thought about space. But it would be a family in space -- 'Lost in
Space.' I think the reason maybe why I'm following families so many times -- on
purpose or by accident -- is that ... it's an endless source of dramatic and
comedic juicy stuff. It's a big bucket of ammunition for telling stories."
</P>
<P>
	   Each time Anderson has pulled more from the bucket. His first movie, "Hard
Eight," was a noirish look at a father figure and a son. His second, "Boogie
Nights," followed a surrogate family of pornographers buffeted by greed, ego and
morality.
</P>
<P>
	   Now comes "Magnolia," a three-hour swirling epic that features 12 characters
in overlapping plot lines, an amphibian downpour and a scene in which the actors
suddenly ease into song.
</P>
<P>
	   Make no mistake, it's still about families: There's an estranged son and his
dying father, a morose trophy wife, a dad leeching off his son's IQ, and a TV
quiz show host who is a private monster -- and that's just a few of the stories.
</P>
<P>
	   "This movie is trying harder to face up to family a little bit more," says
Anderson, whose rumpled appearance lends him the air of a junior mad scientist.
"It's trying to be a little bit harder on it, in a good way.
</P>
<P>
	   "'Boogie Nights' is saying, 'Just hang out with your friends, it's a lot
easier to hang out there than it is to go back home.' This movie is saying,
'Smarten up and go home. Or at least try."'
</P>
<P>
	   Helping this time are the usual suspects: Philip Baker Hall, Philip Seymour
Hoffman, John C. Reilly and Melora Walters -- all actors who have appeared in
Anderson's three films. Julianne Moore also co-starred in "Boogie Nights."
</P>
<P>
	   "It's an opportunity for me to create a family of people to work with that
makes me comfortable and happy and will watch out for me," he explains. "You can
choose your friends. You can't choose your family -- that's really what it is."
</P>
<P>
	   Sellar, who joined Anderson's odd little troupe with "Boogie Nights," has
her own opinion: "He's created his own dysfunctional family -- making films
about dysfunctional families."
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson grew up in California's San Fernando Valley, raised on a steady
diet of movies, both trashy and sublime. His father did voice-overs and
introduced late-night horror films on TV as Ghoulardi. Anderson refuses to talk
about his mother.
</P>
<P>
	   His dad gave him a Betamax video camera in the early 1980s and Paul began
looking at life through the viewfinder. He walked out of film school after two
days, got into a filmmaker's workshop at the Sundance Institute and was barely
able to drink legally when his first movie came out.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, stars like Tom Cruise (part of the ensemble cast in "Magnolia")
have come a-knocking, the budgets have grown bigger -- "I can film ALL the way
around the room, as opposed to three-quarters of the way around a room" -- and
so have the accolades.
</P>
<P>
	   Some have compared the rail-thin screenwriter with wide, unblinking eyes to
a scruffier Robert Altman. Inevitably, he's also been lumped into the Spike
Jonze category of up-and-comers.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you see these movies, your getting to watch me learn. Hopefully, if I
get to continue to do this, I'd like to be able to be an old man and go,
'There's my diary for anyone to look at."'
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson's diary, as he approached "Magnolia," was stuffed. There were
random story arcs and loose threads -- all lubricated by music from alt-rocker
Aimee Mann, formerly of the '80s band 'Til Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "At the time I started to write, I had just 400,000 ideas floating around
and nowhere to put it. Aimee had a place to put it. I said, 'You're talking
about what I'm trying to get in touch with here, everything that's spinning
around in my head. You've got it down."'
</P>
<P>
	   "The movie's like a musical -- it's pretty much wall-to-wall music. In a
good way, I hope. It was designed that way. I don't like that theory of 'Well,
you should be able to take the music out.' Why? Why would I take out all the
music? That's absurd."
</P>
<P>
	   After the hoopla following "Boogie Night," Anderson had intended his next
film to be a more intimate affair. And so had his collaborators.
</P>
<P>
	   "When we were talking during editing 'Boogie Nights,' Paul was kind of, 'Oh,
no, I just want to do something really quick and short next time,"' says Sellar.
"And then he preceded to go off and write and came back to me with 'Magnolia,'
which is neither quick nor short."
</P>
<P>
	   Ask Anderson how that happened and he shrugs. "It's so hand-in-hand and
confused, so chicken-egg. I think what I had was separate lists about stories I
could have made and then at one point just thought that it should all just be."
</P>
<P>
	   And so he let it be.
</P>
<P>
	   "Warren Beatty was really funny. He called me up after seeing 'Magnolia' and
said, 'So, I saw your movies. I thought they were too short.' I was, like, 'Good
one, Warren."'

<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today as investors again moved money away
from pricey technology shares and toward blue-chip industrials that perform well
when the economy is growing.
</P>
<P>
	   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up
82.21 at 11,593.29, above its closing record of 11,572.20 set on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were narrowly mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 2.94 at 1,441.50, and the Nasdaq composite index was off 0.81 at
3,920.38. In earlier trading, the Nasdaq was down as much as 86 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Yahoo! led a decline in Internet stocks. Shares of the Internet service
provider fell 15 5/8 to 381 3/4 a day after the company posted a
better-than-expected profit report. Yahoo! said late Tuesday it earned 19 cents
per share in the fourth quarter, above Wall Street's prediction of 15 cents per
share.
</P>
<P>
	   But company officials warned in a conference call that Yahoo!'s strong
revenue growth is not sustainable, and that prompted investors to sell shares
today.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, Microsoft fell 3 7/8 to 105 1/2 and Oracle fell 1 to 111 3/8.
</P>
<P>
	   With technology stocks slipping, investors once again sought out relative
bargains in the industrial and consumer goods sectors. After lagging behind the
high-flying Nasdaq in the second half of 1999, the Dow Jones industrials have
outstripped other market measures so far this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, 3M rose 1 13/16 to 102 5/16, and Merck rose 1 11/16 to 74 11/16.
</P>
<P>
	   The broadening of the market beyond its earlier focus on high-tech has
created a healthier environment for investors, many analysts believe.
</P>
<P>
	   "Breadth has improved dramatically this year," said Gregory Nie, technical
analyst at First Union Securities in Chicago. "This market has a good enough,
healthy enough underpinning to support a real rally."
</P>
<P>
	   Still, stocks may struggle in the next two sessions as investors await the
next round of economic indicators. On Thursday, the government will report on
producer prices for December, as well as retail sales. On Friday, the Labor
Department will release its Consumer Price Index, a widely watched gauge of
inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   The reports should offer some indication of the Federal Reserve's next move
on interest rates. Many analysts believe the Fed will raise rates at its next
meeting on Feb. 1 and 2, and may impose further hikes later in the year to keep
inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
	   Higher interest rates can hurt stocks by cutting into corporate profits as
it becomes more expensive to borrow money.
</P>
<P>
	   Bond investors, highly sensitive to inflation and short-term rate changes,
today sent the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond to 6.68 percent from 6.67
percent late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 446.91 million shares, behind Tuesday's
midday pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 1.42 to 491.09.

<HEADLINE> Judge Orders More Northwest Talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ST. PAUL. Minn. (AP) -- A federal judge has ordered Northwest Airlines and
its flight attendants union to resume private negotiations, even though the
National Mediation Board has scheduled no talks.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Donovan Frank ordered the two sides to pick a private
mediator by Friday or provide him with a list of acceptable mediators.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge said he wanted to see either a tentative agreement by Feb. 4 or a
"detailed" list of issues between the two sides and ordered both sides back to
his courtroom Feb. 15-16 to present evidence.
</P>
<P>
	   Northwest spokesman Jon Austin said late Tuesday that the company is aware
of the ruling, but couldn't comment further.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials with the Teamsters Local 2000 did not return phone calls seeking
comment. A spokesman for the National Mediation Board did not immediately return
a phone call Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Frank said in his ruling that both the Eagan-based airline and the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 2000 have "represented to the court
that they are presently more than willing to engage in good faith negotiations
in an effort to end a three-year deadlock."
</P>
<P>
	   Mediated talks between Northwest and its flight attendants have been
recessed since Dec. 7 and no talks are scheduled, but the National Mediation
Board has not declared an impasse to trigger a 30-day countdown to a strike.
</P>
<P>
	   Northwest has said repeatedly since talks were recessed that it would return
to the bargaining table when summoned by the mediation board. Local 2000 had
pushed for private talks until mediated negotiations were resumed.
</P>
<P>
	   Frank granted Northwest a temporary restraining order last week to prevent
flight attendants from engaging in job actions that would harm the carrier.
</P>
<P>
	   The union of 11,000 Northwest flight attendants has been seeking a new
contract since September 1996. In late August, Local 2000 members overwhelmingly
rejected a tentative agreement that had been endorsed by union
negotiators.

<HEADLINE> 'Millionaire' Back on ABC  </HEADLINE>
    By FRAZIER MOORE AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- "Nobody thought it could possibly work," Regis Philbin
began Sunday night as his ABC game show, "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire," made
its breathless return for "a brand-new century."
</P>
<P>
	   Having proved itself in August then November as more than a fly-by-night
success, "Millionaire" was now back for an eight-night marathon (continuing
tonight at 8 p.m. EST and on through Sunday) before settling into an open-ended
run of three airings per week.
</P>
<P>
	   "The eagle has landed!" crowed host Philbin, presumably departing from the
script ...
</P>
<P>
	   One day last week, "Millionaire" executive producer Michael Davies was
plotting that opening sequence. He wanted to come back with a bang. Maybe kick
off with a visual pastiche of past big winners, spiced with a bit of
we-told-you-so for the show's naysayers.
</P>
<P>
	   Plus, some purple prose to capture the phenomenon when, "night after night,
31 memorable nights, a nation sat transfixed as real Americans rode a roller
coaster of raw emotions."
</P>
<P>
	   Davies would soon sit down to write those opening lines for his host to
bring to life.
</P>
<P>
	   But he, Philbin and the entire "Millionaire" staff are also strapping
themselves in for another ride on the game-show roller coaster, this time
sharing it with Fox's copycat, "Greed," as well as Johnny-come-latelies "Winning
Lines" (CBS) and "Twenty-One" (NBC).
</P>
<P>
	   Until last Aug. 16, game shows hadn't clicked in network prime-time since
the 1950s. Then came the premiere of "Millionaire," a British-bred quiz show
that Davies, a 33-year-old former ABC exec who himself is British-born, had
talked the network into letting him import.
</P>
<P>
	   "'Millionaire' now seems like such a big, obvious, 'duh!' sort of television
program," Davies notes. "But before it went on the air, this was the most
alternative, the most pie-in-the-sky, the most unlikely-to-work idea."
</P>
<P>
	   He doesn't begrudge other producers now riding the quiz-show wave and makes
no forecasts for what effect, if any, their clones will have on "Millionaire."
</P>
<P>
	   But Davies can claim two advantages with final-answer certainty: His show
was first, and it has something that no one else's has -- talk-show veteran
Regis Philbin.
</P>
<P>
	   "I can't say enough about how great he's been," Davies declares.
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, for ratings-anemic ABC, "Millionaire" has proven to be Dr. Regis'
Audience Pick-Me-Up (recommended dosage: schedule as needed).
</P>
<P>
	   But simple Nielsen glory hardly conveys the show's impact on the national
consciousness.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's been amazing to watch the show just penetrate the pop culture," Davies
says.
</P>
<P>
	   He caught his first glimpse in September on a drive through Pennsylvania.
Along the way, he happened to pick up a local newspaper, whereupon his eye fell
on a sports story that referred to a team's uncertain prospects as "the $1
million question."
</P>
<P>
	   As Davies realized, "before August, it would have read 'the $64,000
question"' -- a turn of phrase born of a game show nearly 50 years ago, updated
only now, thanks to "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire."
</P>
<P>
	   On the other hand, Davies doesn't really consider "Millionaire" a game show.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it works in spite of being a game show," he says. "You don't ever
actually worry about the game. You just watch the drama unfold."
</P>
<P>
	   He means the drama of each contestant facing 15 successive multiple-choice
questions that, when answered correctly, mean a million-dollar payday. "I don't
think you follow the game elements," he says. "I think you follow the human
nature of it."
</P>
<P>
	   In Davies' large yet sparsely appointed office, one conspicuous element is a
bulletin board posted with different colored index cards bearing titles like
"Mastermind," "Smush" and "TFI Friday." These are project ideas to which Davies,
as an independent producer, would like to turn his attention.
</P>
<P>
	   But for the moment, "Millionaire" is too big a hit and too much work.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think any of us had any idea how tough it would be to do," he
concedes. According to the unforgiving cycle, each episode is taped just one day
before air. Then time-consuming post-production starts. "We came alarmingly
close to not delivering the show on several occasions."
</P>
<P>
	   He sighs, a little weary but clearly fired up. Then, before returning to a
staff meeting to thrash out that opening, he grapples with a million-dollar
question: What have the past few months meant to him?
</P>
<P>
	   "I've had what you might think would be the greatest feeling anyone could
have as a television producer," he replies. "But I've never had one time when I
thought, 'This is great, we've changed television.' Because we're all working
like a mother to get the next show out!"
</P>
<P>
	   That's it? Final answer? Davies reconsiders and smiles. "This is about as
good as it gets."
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere in television ...
</P>
<P>
	   SEINFELD ON 'DILBERT': You haven't seen him much in anything new since
"Seinfeld" folded a couple of seasons ago -- and you won't see him now. But
Jerry Seinfeld will be heard as the voice of an arrogant supercomputer named
Comp-U-Comp in an episode of UPN's animated-cartoon office comedy "Dilbert,"
airing next month. The program reunites Seinfeld with "Dilbert" executive
producer Larry Charles, who was supervising producer and writer on "Seinfeld."
The episode is scheduled for Feb. 22 at 9:30 p.m. EST.

	   "My first century in the business has been great, and I have been blessed
with a lot of success," says entertainer Dolly Parton. "But at the start of my
second century, I feel like a kid in a candy store, and everyone knows I've got
a big sweet tooth!" Parton, who was born on Jan. 19, 1946, has announced plans
to expand her Dollywood theme park empire. She has also announced that her
nonprofit Dollywood Foundation will offer its "Imagination Library" to any
community willing to raise funds for a local program. Since 1995, more than
120,000 books have been distributed in Parton's native Sevier County in
Tennessee.

	   Jim Carrey has been nominated for a Golden Globe for his portrayal of the
late comic Andy Kaufman in "Man on the Moon." Carrey, who was born on Jan. 17,
1962, won a Golden Globe in 1999 for "The Truman Show." But Carrey says he is
aware that his fame may be fleeting. "I wake up some mornings and sit and have
my coffee and look out at my beautiful garden and I go, 'Remember how good this

including "Dances With Wolves," "The Untouchables," "Bull Durham," "Field of

box-office disasters, he says: "I have faith in the movies and I have faith in
my own choices about what I do. The measure of movies is how well they do at the
box office or how well critics receive a film -- and I think those are false

<HEADLINE> Bach Rocks but Without Skid Row  </HEADLINE>
    By GERARD O'LEARY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP)-- Sebastian Bach, former lead singer for the dismantled heavy
metal band Skid Row, leans back in his chair and reflects on what led to the
breakup.
</P>
<P>
	   "They basically kicked me out," Bach said. "We started with the same idea of
what we wanted in a band, but they started looking to other bands for
inspiration and that's like the enemy to me."
</P>
<P>
	   Skid Row was synonymous with '80s heavy metal and was considered the cream
of the crop. The band's self-titled, metal-blasting debut album, released in
1989, eventually sold more than five million copies in the United States. That
same year, Skid Row opened for Bon Jovi and Motley Crue, touring across the
country and also taking part in the historic Moscow Music Peace Festival at
Lenin Stadium.
</P>
<P>
	   The band's 1991 album "Slave to the Grind" debuted at the No. 1 spot on the
U.S. chart, avoiding the dreaded "sophomore jinx."
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought we were going to be like AC/DC, Aerosmith and Kiss; I never
wanted to break up that band," Bach, 31, said. "We only had three studio albums
and an EP; I wanted 20."
</P>
<P>
	   When grunge came on the scene in the '90s, Skid Row and other metal bands
were considered uncool. The band broke up after the release of its "Subhuman
Race" album in 1995. Other band members slid into oblivion, but Bach continued
on, contributing a song to the soundtrack of Wes Craven's 1996 movie "Scream"
and singing on tribute albums to Rush and Iron Maiden.
</P>
<P>
	   When he decided to go back on the road, Bach put together a band consisting
of guitarists Jimmy Flemion and Richie Scarlet, best known for his work with Ace
Frehley; drummer Mark McConnell; and a bassist known only as Larry. Two weeks of
dates became more than 100 gigs, with stops in Japan, Korea and Canada, plus two
weeks of touring U.S. arenas as the opening act for Pantera.
</P>
<P>
	   "The first time we hit the stage in Japan," Bach recalled, "the lights went
down and the sound of the crowd was the loudest, most vociferous reception I've
ever experienced in my life -- and I've played every big arena you could name."
</P>
<P>
	   His new album "Bring 'Em Bach Alive!" (Spitfire Records) captures some of
the intensity of his live performances and demonstrates the chemistry he has
with his new band.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the live cuts, Bach recorded five new songs with legendary
session drummer Anton Fig.
</P>
<P>
	   "Every time I ask him to jam with me, he says 'yes' and I never expect him
to say 'yes,"' Bach said with a laugh. "I had him at my house last week jammin'
and I'm saying to myself, 'I'm the luckiest guy."'
</P>
<P>
	   "Bring 'Em Bach Alive!" was co-produced by Bach and producer Michael
Wagener, who has worked with Metallica, Ozzy Osbourne and Janet Jackson. "I
figured if it's going to have my name on the cover, I'd better take
responsibility for everything," Bach said. "I'm proud of how the guitars sound
and the overall production."
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Bach is working on a new album to be released later this year.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Kate Betts  </HEADLINE>
    By CAROL DEEGAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- In an interview, Katherine Betts talked about her career in
fashion journalism and her new job as editor in chief of Harper's Bazaar
magazine.
</P>
<P>
	   1. What were your dreams growing up?
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Betts: I always wanted to be a reporter, actually. Actually, that's not
true (laughs). Um, I always wanted to be a reporter, but I actually really
wanted to be a ballet dancer. I grew up in New York and I danced and thank God
my parents cut that dream short (laughs).
</P>
<P>
	   2. Did you go to journalism school?
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Betts: No, I actually majored in European history. ... In high school, I
worked on the paper, and I went to Princeton and I worked on The Daily
Princetonian, although not to any great success because it was very much a boys'
club, which I resented deeply when I was there. But I did want to work for a
newspaper when I graduated.
</P>
<P>
	   3. How did you get your start?
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Betts: I'm a big Francophile and I love Paris. I really wanted to live
there. So I kind of decided, OK, for a year I'll go and just see what I can do.
... And I went to Paris, everybody else was going to Wall Street, I thought, 'My
God, I'm crazy, I'm throwing away this education, I don't know what I'm going to
do there, I'll never get working papers.' But I was really lucky. I got a job at
The (International) Herald-Tribune on the support staff. ... I didn't write
anything for them, but it was great to be in Paris and to be the only person in
that office who spoke fluent French, so I was useful (laughs).
</P>
<P>
	   3 1/2. Do you read every word of Bazaar 10 times before publication?
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Betts: Not 10 times (laughs), but I read all the manuscripts and revised
manuscripts, finals. I read all of the titles and blurbs and I reread them again
when we do something called release, which is where we lay out the whole
magazine. And cover lines, captions. We're always working on three issues at one
time. Right now, we're closing March, and we've assigned April and May, and
we're starting to think about June, and now April, we have to really think about
April visuals. We're sort of finishing those up because that will all be shot in
January. You just have to always be thinking on like four different planes
basically.
</P>
<P>
	   4. Do you have a 40-hour day?
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Betts: There aren't enough hours in the day, I have to say (laughs).
It's really hard. You can't do it all, that's why you have to have great talent
working for you; people that you trust their judgment.
</P>
<P>
	   4 1/2. Is this job everything you dreamed it would be?
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Betts: Yeah. It's amazing. It's overwhelming, I have to be honest. There
is so much to do, but that's the exciting part, too, because it really is like
starting over, you know, and we can do anything. And I have to say that Hearst
has been incredibly supportive of all of our ideas, and even when I told them
that we wanted to change the logo, I was kind of scared that they would freak
out because it is a logo that has been redrawn a lot, but the typeface hasn't
really been radically changed. And I remember I went into a meeting with (Hearst
Magazines president) Cathie Black, and I thought I'd just sort of slip it in to
test the waters and see what her reaction would be, and she was very casual
about it, she was like 'Fine, you know, whatever you think is the right thing to
do,' and that's great, that is really, really unusual.
</P>
<P>
	   5. Are you excited about the completely redesigned February issue?
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Betts: Yeah. I am. I'm kind of nervous (laughs). I go back and forth. I
mean, I feel very excited about it because I feel like we hit a lot of the notes
we wanted to hit that I didn't think would necessarily be possible to hit in one
issue the first time out. But then I still have sleepless nights thinking, 'Oh,
my God, maybe this is the wrong thing to put into this issue!' I don't know, I
think risk is important.

<HEADLINE> Kate Betts Launches a New Bazaar  </HEADLINE>
    By CAROL DEEGAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Katherine Betts accepted an offer to become editor in chief
of Harper's Bazaar three days before her first child was born.
</P>
<P>
	   Harper's Bazaar is a Hearst Magazines publication. Ms. Betts, 35, had worked
for eight years at competitor Vogue, published by Conde Nast, and was closely
identified with editor in chief Anna Wintour. ("... She gave me her blessing,"
Ms. Betts wrote in her December editor's letter.)
</P>
<P>
	   "I actually accepted the job on my due date, which was really insane when I
think back on it," she said in an interview in her sun-filled office. "People
are now saying to me, 'How did you do it? How did you take the job on the same
day?' Well, I had the baby three days later."
</P>
<P>
	   Oliver Betts Brown was born in June. "I officially started Sept. 1. In
August, I was coming in a few days a week. I was working from home right away."
</P>
<P>
	   She replaced Liz Tilberis, the celebrated Bazaar editor who died of ovarian
cancer last April.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past four months, Ms. Betts has redesigned Bazaar from head to toe,
including the magazine's logo. She has added new sections, new writers and new
photographers. The layouts and typefaces are new, and the cover is glossy. The
February issue, which is completely redesigned, goes on sale at newsstands on
Jan. 17.
</P>
<P>
	   Ultimately, the success of the new Bazaar will be measured in fashion buzz,
readership and advertising dollars.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Betts, a Princeton graduate who prefers to be called Kate, is known for
her strong writing style and fashion knowledge with an eye toward new trends.
</P>
<P>
	   "A lot of people have said I'm going to make Bazaar like In Style, which I
don't know where they get that information, or (they ask) 'Are you going to put
celebrities on every cover?' They're focusing on the wrong thing.
</P>
<P>
	   "To me, the success of In Style ... it's not the fact that there are
celebrities on the cover; it's not the fact that they do product endorsement. To
me, what's great about In Style is the tone. They've created this uniform,
all-inclusive, friendly not pretentious (magazine). They've brought that to the
fashion world and to Hollywood where it didn't exist before and that's what
makes that magazine successful. It's like what made Martha Stewart successful."
</P>
<P>
	   Gwyneth Paltrow, star of "The Talented Mr. Ripley," is on the February
cover. The January issue featured a full-page photo and an interview with
co-star Jude Law, nominated for a Golden Globe for his performance, who was
relatively unknown before "Ripley."
</P>
<P>
	   "We can't lose sight of the idea of supporting new talent and spotlighting
new talent and being a home for those kind of personalities," Ms. Betts said.
"Because I feel like that's the thing that drives magazines now, that's what
people are interested in. They are interested in stories and personalities and
what those people have to say for themselves. ... We have to think about
celebrities and the stories they can bring to the magazine in a new way."
</P>
<P>
	   Readers should not expect celebrity covers to become standard issue because
it would take away "from the surprise and the occasion" of having a celebrity on
the cover, Ms. Betts said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't want to commit to like, you know, we'll do six celebrities and six
models. Who knows? We will do what we feel is right for the moment."
</P>
<P>
	   One goal is to attract a slightly younger readership, down from about age 38
to 35, she said, adding that fashion age is not necessarily something that is
measured in years.
</P>
<P>
	   "Twenty-five-year-olds are wearing designer labels more than ever and
65-year-olds are wearing Old Navy and the Gap more than ever," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   She also wants Bazaar to take a more journalistic stance, not follow the
fashion pack and "give fashion that extra layer, that extra story, that extra
bit of information that I always think tends to get lost in the shuffle because
the emphasis has been so much on glamour and celebrity, and certainly those two
things are important ingredients of fashion, but I don't think they are the only
interesting part of fashion."
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Betts also believes that it is important to show fashion in a bigger
cultural context.
</P>
<P>
	   "In order to sort of illuminate fashion, you have to give the reader an idea
of what's going on around the frock or the runway or the new hemline," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "And I have to say that that's something that I really, really learned about
from John Fairchild, because he was a genius at always looking at the guest list
or the menu at a dinner party instead of only what people were wearing."
</P>
<P>
	   From 1988 to 1991, Ms. Betts was a reporter and later bureau chief in the
Paris office of Fairchild Publications. She managed the office of the daily
trade paper Women's Wear Daily, W and M magazines, and helped launch W Europe.
</P>

	   "I loved it," she said. "It is really an amazing school for fashion, but it
teaches you a lot about reporting and covering a beat, because the fashion beat
is so specific, and also you have to cover the business side, so you really
learn the whole business from the inside out."
</P>
<P>
	   A friend introduced her to Ms. Wintour, who offered her an editing job at
Vogue. Ms. Betts turned it down because she wanted to continue writing.
</P>
<P>
	   "I remember thinking, 'Oh, my God, she's never going to call me again, what
have I done?' But she called me a few months later and offered me a writing job
and that's when I moved back.
</P>
<P>
	   "Anna gave me a lot of freedom right from the beginning. I was writing a lot
of stories, fashion features. But I was also writing a lot of copy for the
magazine, which I actually love doing that kind of stuff, like titles and blurbs
and cover lines. And I started off right away working a lot on the tone and
changing the tone and making it snappier and smarter and funnier, and it was
great, I mean, she really, really is a great boss in that way; if you want to do
something, she lets you do it."
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Betts is crafting a new Bazaar while acknowledging the magazine's
traditions. Bazaar started charting fashion in 1867.
</P>
<P>
	   "One of the things I love about the tradition of Bazaar as a mainstream
magazine is that sort of quirkiness that it's always had, and that was something
(art director Alexey) Brodovitch started in the '50s, and he kind of introduced
this idea of surprising the reader and doing something a little bit offbeat
every once in a while.
</P>
<P>
	   "The famous quote that he always used to say was 'astonish me,' and I think
that that's something that Bazaar has that very few mainstream magazines have in
their tradition, and I think that it's also something that's missing from a lot
of magazines because it has become very same and formulaic."

<HEADLINE> Disney Studio Boss Expected To Quit  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GERMAIN AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Walt Disney studio boss Joe Roth, under whom the company
released two of its top three films ever, is expected to resign today, sources
told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   Disney would not confirm the move, but sources who spoke on condition of
anonymity said the company and Roth were expected to issue a news release today
announcing his departure.
</P>
<P>
	   The resignation would follow another record year at the box office for
Disney, which was the top film distributor worldwide with $2.6 billion in ticket
sales and No. 1 domestically with $1.24 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The studio's 1999 releases included "The Sixth Sense," which has taken in
$276 million domestically, and "Toy Story 2," which has grossed $220 million.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the first time two films from the same distributor topped the $200
million mark in one year. The movies are second and third on Disney's all-time
list, behind "The Lion King" with $312 million.
</P>
<P>
	   As head of studio operations, Roth oversaw film, TV, video and animation
production. Studio chairman since 1994, Roth also was responsible for such
movies as "Armageddon," "The Waterboy" and "Enemy of the State."
</P>
<P>
	   Sources would not disclose Roth's plans, but the Los Angeles Times reported
today that he intends to form his own independent movie company.
</P>
<P>
	   Roth's resignation would be the latest in a string of high-profile
departures of top Disney brass in the last few years, including two former chief
financial officers, Steve Bollenbach and Richard Nanula, ABC TV and radio
station chief Steve Burke and cable programming boss Geraldine Laybourne.
</P>
<P>
	   Disney also suffered through costly severance settlements with former top
executives Jeffrey Katzenberg and Michael Ovitz.
</P>
<P>
	   Roth took over Disney studio operations after Katzenberg quit. Previously,
Roth had been movie chairman at 20th Century Fox and also ran two independent
film companies, Morgan Creek Productions and Caravan Productions.

    JERUSALEM (AP) -- Leading a delegation of American labor leaders in Israel,
AFL-CIO president John Sweeney said Wednesday that only a stronger labor
movement can protect workers' rights in a global economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Sweeney and his host, Israeli labor leader and legislator Amir Peretz, led a
one-day conference in Tel Aviv on globalization. They said the process tends to
deprive workers in industrialized countries of pension rights, insurance and
other aspects of social security.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think we have these problems in all the industrialized countries and we
have to address them in the most effective way possible, and the way to do it is
to build a stronger labor union," Sweeney said.

	   Wednesday was the seventh day of Sweeney's trip to Israel and the
Palestinian areas. His six-member delegation of union leaders met Israeli
President Ezer Weizman and planned to have talks with Prime Minister Ehud Barak,

<HEADLINE> Census Seeks Local Gov't Support  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Census Bureau is trying to drum up support among local
government officials in hopes of improving public participation in the national
head count.
</P>
<P>
	   It costs the agency millions of dollars to track down and interview people
who fail to mail back their census forms, so it wants state and local
politicians to help remind people to fill out the questionnaires.
</P>
<P>
	   April 1 is the official census day and forms will be sent in the mail
shortly before that date.
</P>
<P>
	   In a program called ``How America Knows What America Needs,'' the bureau is
sending promotion kits to governors, tribal leaders, county commissioners,
mayors and other top elected officials.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Because the census is so important to every resident, we must do
everything we can to ensure that everyone is included in the count,'' Commerce
Secretary William M. Daley said in a statement this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Because Census numbers are used to allocate billions of dollars in federal
and state funds the results of the count are vital to local governments.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Census 2000 can be a civic event that reverses the troubling decline in
the level of civic engagement across our country,'' Census Bureau Director
Kenneth Prewitt said.
</P>
<P>
	   The first part of the program challenges communities to increase their
mail-back rates in the census by at least 5 percentage points over the 1990
level.
</P>
<P>
	   To gauge progress, Census 2000 response rates for each jurisdiction will be
posted on the Internet and updated daily from March 27 to April 11.
</P>
<P>
	   The second component seeks to encourage public cooperation with enumerators,
both for households that fail to return their forms by mail and for some rural
households where forms are not mailed.

<HEADLINE> Ford Phases In Side Air-Bag System  </HEADLINE>
    By CATHERINE STRONG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. is phasing in side air-bag curtains on
sport utility vehicles that are designed to cover the windows to prevent the
ejection of passengers in rollover crashes.
</P>
<P>
	   The new system, made public today at the Detroit auto show, will be phased
in on SUVs within three years starting with some 2001 models as optional
equipment, Ford officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   In designing the system, Ford is responding to highway crash data that show
pickups and sport utility vehicles, which have a higher center of gravity, roll
over more than cars.
</P>
<P>
	   Passengers in SUVs are four times as likely to be involved in a rollover
during a serious accident as passengers in cars, according to studies.
</P>
<P>
	   Forty-seven percent of all fatalities in light trucks -- which include SUVs
-- result from rollover, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration. In comparison, 22 percent of car deaths involve rollovers.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, the latest year government statistics were available, 9,771 people
died in rollover crashes. Government officials say some 85 percent of rollover
deaths involve passengers not wearing seat belts.
</P>
<P>
	   Most often rollover deaths involve passengers being ejected from the
vehicle. Government officials and automakers have repeatedly said that wearing
seat belts is the single most important way to prevent passengers from being
ejected in a rollover crash.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've looked at the most threatening current driving conditions and
developed new technologies to improve the protection for our SUV drivers and
their families," said Helen Petrauskas, Ford's vice president of environmental
and safety engineering.
</P>
<P>
	   The system has a sensor located between the passenger and driver seat that
can measure the amount of vehicle tilt and trigger the air bag curtain. The
curtain would deploy downward in milliseconds from the edge of the roof closest
to the window, covering both the front and back row of seats.
</P>
<P>
	   The curtain would remain inflated for six seconds, which Ford says is about
the time it takes the average vehicle to roll over up to three times. The
curtains are attached to the vehicle using tethers at the front and back to help
prevent passengers from being thrown out of the vehicle during rollovers.
</P>
<P>
	   The curtain also is intended to reduce head injuries in side-impact crashes,
Ford said.
</P>
<P>
	   Several automakers, such as Mercedes and Volvo, have air bag curtains that
inflate across the windows in their cars. BMW has an air bag that inflates in
the shape of a tube that hangs near the top of the window.
</P>
<P>
	   Those systems are primarily advertised as head protection systems in
side-impact crashes, although the automakers say they could potentially help
prevent passenger ejections during rollover. The Ford system is designed
specifically for rollover protection.
</P>
<P>
	   Many other automakers, including Ford, currently have side air-bag systems
in their cars that deploy from the seat or door and are designed to protect the
head or chest or both in side-impact crashes.

<HEADLINE> Hit HBO Series 'Sopranos' Is Back  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Dysfunctional at best, murderous at worst, the Sopranos are
hardly anyone's idea of a model family.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet television viewers have embraced Tony, Carmela and their extended
famiglia. And on Sunday night they return -- after a long wait -- for a second
season on HBO.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Sopranos" received so much critical praise after only 13 episodes that
it was considered an upset when the series won just four of the 16 Emmy Awards
it was nominated for. Cable's TV Land network last week gave "The Sopranos" its
"Future Classic" award.
</P>
<P>
	   "Hands down, 'The Sopranos' is the most important television show to come
along in years," said Larry Jones, TV Land general manager. "The show's complex
characters and exciting, continuous plotlines all blend seamlessly thanks to one
of the most superb casts ever assembled on television."
</P>
<P>
	   Life doesn't improve this year for New Jersey mob boss Tony, already
suffering from anxiety attacks and a hit attempt ordered by his mother. His
flaky sister arrives from the West Coast and a new nemesis, Richie Aprile, is
released from jail with a chip on his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
	   It's a tribute to the deft work of series creator David Chase that Tony
Soprano became a favorite. The role even made balding, overweight star James
Gandolfini a sex symbol.
</P>
<P>
	   Filming on location in New Jersey with a largely Italian-American cast gives
the plot an ominous authenticity. The mix of mundane family problems with the
more unusual occupational hazards -- like inter-family gunplay -- often makes
"The Sopranos" hilarious.
</P>
<P>
	   Watch in the new season's third episode how the feared mob boss is reduced
to jelly by his teen-age daughter, who suggests her own "punishment" after being
caught partying: a brief ban on using her credit card. Tony and Carmela live in
fear that their daughter will discover how powerless they are to really
discipline her.
</P>
<P>
	   Dominic Chianese, who plays Soprano's uncle and rival, Junior, traces some
of "The Sopranos" success to feelings he remembers from watching King Kong as a
youngster. He feared the monster as he watched it toss subway cars like toys,
yet also felt a little sorry for him.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's got extremely relatable characters, aside from what those characters
do for a living," said Chris Albrecht, HBO president of original programming.
"Their emotions and what drives them feel honest for a wide variety of people."
</P>
<P>
	   As with most successful TV, few people saw it coming. Other networks, most
notably Fox, turned the series down. HBO chief executive Jeff Bewkes, almost
shuddering at the memory, said HBO nearly ordered Chase to change the series'
name.
</P>
<P>
	   In a short time, "The Sopranos" has helped change HBO's image. Once thought
of primarily for its movies and special events, the pay cable outlet is getting
more attention now for original series like "Sex and the City," "Oz" and "The
Chris Rock Show."
</P>
<P>
	   "These shows are successful because they're smart, they're real and they're
well done," Bewkes said. "They're not watered down to make sure everybody gets
it, so they'll still be sitting there when the Pringles commercial comes on."
</P>
<P>
	   An estimated 10 million people watched each episode of "The Sopranos" during
its four weekly airings last year. The series rang up some of its best numbers
on New Year's week, when HBO ran the entire series for an unprecedented third
time, proving people are catching on by word of mouth.
</P>
<P>
	   That's a hit by pay cable standards, though it commands less than half the
audience of "ER," which averages 24 million viewers for one airing of an
original episode. About the same number of people watch "The Sopranos" as tune
in to "Martial Law" or "Just Shoot Me."
</P>
<P>
	   HBO, which is in roughly a quarter of American homes, gained 350,000
subscribers last year, according to an outside analyst. No one can say how many
joined because of "The Sopranos."
</P>
<P>
	   As season two begins, cast members are trying to keep plot twists to
themselves, and are pinching themselves to see if all the attention is real. The
new season is again 13 episodes, and will be wrapped up by the spring.
</P>
<P>
	   "You do get a feeling of 'Oh my God, this is too good to be true,"' Chianese
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Chianese's mother is a fan. She's 92.
</P>
<P>
	   "She says, 'You curse a little too much,"' he said. "But deep down, she
knows it's a character. She was born in the Bronx. She's heard those words, I'm
sure."

<HEADLINE> Studios Buy Mann Theatres Chain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A partnership owned by the Warner Bros. and Paramount
studios has acquired the Mann Theatres chain after a bankruptcy court approved a
$91 million sale agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   The theater chain's parent company, WestStar Cinemas Inc., had filed for
bankruptcy protection last year.
</P>
<P>
	   WestStar agreed to sell the chain to WF Cinema Holdings, a partnership
between Warner Bros. and Paramount, but the bankruptcy court ordered the sale
opened up to competitive bids.
</P>
<P>
	   However, no other companies bid on the 351-screen chain, and the previous
agreement was approved Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner Bros. spokeswoman Barbara Brogliatti told the Daily News of Los
Angeles that the court process was "fairly routine."
</P>
<P>
	   Under terms of the deal, WF Cinema must pay WestStar $46 million immediately
and an additional $45 million by Oct. 15, according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
	   Encino-based WestStar operates 53 Mann Theatres in Colorado and California,
including the landmark Mann's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood.

<HEADLINE> 'Who Wants To Be a Survivor?'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Who wants to be marooned on a desert island?
</P>
<P>
	   OK, so it's not as attractive a question as they one they ask on that other
TV game show, but CBS still had plenty of people show up Tuesday to audition for
"Survivor!"
</P>
<P>
	   Sixteen lucky contestants will spend up to six weeks on a deserted island
without shelter, food, hot water or privacy. Cast members must survive the
elements and each other in hopes of being the last person left. The winner gets
$1 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Every three days, a "tribal council" will vote to kick one contestant off
the island. When only two are left, the last seven eliminated contestants will
vote to determine who loses.
</P>
<P>
	   CBS cameras will tape the scramble for survival.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 6,000 people nationwide are competing for a spot on the show.
Producers will announce the 16 contestants late this month and ship them to the
10-square-mile island off Borneo in March. The show is to air in August.
</P>
<P>
	   Fifty people were being interviewed this week in regional tryouts at KYW-TV
in Philadelphia. The would-be contestants had to sign forms asking about
Japanese encephalitis, dengue and malaria, and promise not to sue in the event
of injury or death.
</P>
<P>
	   The applicants Tuesday included blue-collar workers, students, doctors and
lawyers, and ranged in age from 21 to 62. Some suggested a little time on a
desert island might not be a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
	   "I need a vacation," said prison guard John Hrycyna, 44, who described
strip-searching murderers. "This would be a break from the jungle where I work."
</P>
<P>
	   James Goyet, 25, a military survival instructor, entertained the other
contestants with descriptions of eating maggots: "They taste just like Uncle
Ben's rice."
</P>
<P>
	   Producers said they were looking for people with physical endurance,
intelligence, humor and people skills.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'll know it when we see it," said contestant coordinator Stephanie
Furman. "You just know when you meet somebody whether they're the kind of person
you want to keep talking to, or who you want to watch."

<HEADLINE> Court Protects Drivers' Privacy  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE ASSEO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress can protect motorists' privacy by barring states
from selling the personal information on driver's licenses, the Supreme Court
ruled today.
</P>
<P>
	   The law does not violate states' rights, the justices said in a unanimous
decision that ran counter to their recent trend of reining in Congress' power
over the states.
</P>
<P>
	   The case involves South Carolina's challenge to the 1994 Driver's Privacy
Protection Act, enacted in response to the 1989 killing of actress Rebecca
Schaeffer by a stalker who used a private investigator to get her address from
driver's license records.
</P>
<P>
	   The act ``does not require the states in their sovereign capacity to
regulate their own citizens,'' Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote for the
court.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It does not require the South Carolina Legislature to enact any laws or
regulations, and it does not require state officials to assist in the
enforcement of federal statutes regulating private individuals,'' the chief
justice said.
</P>
<P>
	   The law bars states and their employees from releasing personal information
from motor vehicle records, including names, addresses, telephone and Social
Security numbers and photographs.
</P>
<P>
	   States routinely have sold such information to businesses and political
candidates, earning millions of dollars in revenue each year. When Congress
enacted the law, 34 states made driver's license records public in some form.
</P>
<P>
	   The law includes exceptions, allowing such information to be disclosed to
law enforcement officials, courts, government agencies and private
investigators. No exemption is included for the news media.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision was criticized by Gregg Leslie, acting Executive Director of
the Reporters'
</P>
<P>
	   Committee for Freedom of the Press.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For perhaps 100 years, state legislators have always made these decisions
by balancing privacy with the public need to know,'' Leslie said. ``Then without
research, Congress, reacting to some scares, made a sweeping decision to deny
access to all this information.''
</P>
<P>
	   South Carolina argued that Congress' power to regulate interstate commerce
did not give it the authority to govern the release of such state records. The
4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed in 1998 and blocked the law's
enforcement in South Carolina, Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia and West
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Department lawyers argued to the Supreme Court that releasing
driver's license records means people are forced to provide the key to their
personal information on their license plates.
</P>
<P>
	   But South Carolina's lawyers said state employees could not be required to
enforce a federal law.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, the justices ruled that Congress could not force the states to
conduct background checks on prospective gun buyers.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Rehnquist said today's case was more like a 1988 case in which the
Supreme Court upheld a law that barred states from issuing unregistered bonds.
The law regulated state activities but did not try to control how states
regulate private parties, the court said at the time.
</P>
<P>
	   Last October, Congress sought to buttress its power to keep states from
making driver's license records public. Lawmakers passed a new version of the
ban but tied it to Congress' broader authority over spending, applying the ban
to any state that receives federal transportation funds. That law was not at
issue in today's ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   The case is Reno vs. Condon, 98-1464.

<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today as investors again moved money away
from pricey technology shares and toward blue-chip industrials that perform well
when the economy is growing.
</P>
<P>
	   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up
65.15 at 11,576.23, narrowly higher than its closing record of 11,572.20 set on
Monday.
</P>

	   Broader stock indicators were slightly lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 1.79 at 1,436.77, and the Nasdaq composite index was off 19.54 at

</P>
<P>
	   But company officials warned in a conference call that Yahoo!'s strong
revenue growth is not sustainable, and that prompted investors to sell shares
today.

	   Also, Microsoft fell 3 7/16 to 105 15/16 and Oracle fell 4 to 108 3/8.
</P>
<P>
	   With technology stocks slipping, investors once again sought out relative
bargains in the industrial and consumer goods sectors. After lagging behind the
high-flying Nasdaq in the second half of 1999, the Dow Jones industrials have
outstripped other market measures so far this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, 3M rose 2 to 102 1/2, and Merck rose  5/8 to 73 7/8.
</P>
<P>
	   The broadening of the market beyond its earlier focus on high-tech has
created a healthier environment for investors, many analysts believe.
</P>
<P>
	   "Breadth has improved dramatically this year," said Gregory Nie, technical
analyst at First Union Securities in Chicago. "This market has a good enough,
healthy enough underpinning to support a real rally."
</P>
<P>
	   Still, stocks may struggle in the next two sessions as investors await the
next round of economic indicators. On Thursday, the government will report on
producer prices for December, as well as retail sales. On Friday, the Labor
Department will release its Consumer Price Index, a widely watched gauge of
inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   The reports should offer some indication of the Federal Reserve's next move
on interest rates. Many analysts believe the Fed will raise rates at its next
meeting on Feb. 1 and 2, and may impose further hikes later in the year to keep
inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
	   Higher interest rates can hurt stocks by cutting into corporate profits as
it becomes more expensive to borrow money.
</P>
<P>
	   Bond investors, highly sensitive to inflation and short-term rate changes,
today sent the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond to 6.70 percent from 6.67
percent late Tuesday. Bond yields are now at their highest levels since
September 1997, pressuring stocks by offering lucrative, fixed returns.
</P>
<P>

Stock Exchange, where volume came to 661.20 million shares, behind Tuesday
afternoon's pace.

    STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Isaac Stern and Bob Dylan will share this year's
Polar Music Prize, the Royal Swedish Academy of Music said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Stern, the 79-year-old violin virtuoso, is president of Carnegie Hall and
credited with saving it from the wrecking ball in the 1960s. He was also praised
for his seminars for young people.
</P>

unflinching support for the less fortunate," committee member Roger Wallis said.
</P>
<P>
	   The prize is endowed by the late Stikkan Anderson, whose record company
released the songs of the Swedish group ABBA. It's awarded annually to one

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes Tax Break for Poor  </HEADLINE>
   By TERENCE HUNT AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton entered the election-year battle over
taxes today with a $21 billion plan to combat poverty by expanding tax breaks
for low-income people.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton described the initiative as part of a ``new opportunity agenda''
that he will unveil in his Jan. 27 State of the Union address to Congress. The
overall program is designed to help all Americans share in the nation's growing
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For the first time in my lifetime,'' Clinton said, ``we begin a new
century with greater prosperity, greater social progress, greater national
self-confidence; with the absence of an internal crisis or an external threat
that could derail our further forward movement. This has never happened in my
lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, in a speech to the Democratic Leadership Council, announced he will
seek an expansion of the earned-income tax credit, costing $21 billion over 10
years. The measure could help Vice President Al Gore answer initiatives of
former Sen. Bill Bradley, his rival for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley has proposed expanding the tax credit for low-wage workers as part
of a $9.8 billion ``wholesale rescue effort'' for the poor.
</P>
<P>
	   Introducing Clinton, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said the nation's
booming economy would be ``a great legacy'' for the president. Clinton replied,
``I always get nervous when people start talking about legacies. ... It's just
one small step from legacy to lame duck.'' But Clinton reassured himself that
you're not a lame duck until you give a speech and no one shows up.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's initiative would require approval by an election-minded Congress,
where Republicans and Democrats are deeply divided over the size and shape of
any tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee,
said the credit always has enjoyed bipartisan support in Congress. But, he
added, ``Taxpayers might question spending billions more on a program that the
IRS says already wastes close to $6.5 billion each year -- or about one dollar
out of every five -- because of fraud and mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
	   The earned-income tax credit was created in 1975 to keep people working and
to offset the payroll taxes they contribute for Social Security and Medicare. It
also was intended to give people an incentive to stay off welfare. In 1993, a
Democratic Congress approved the largest increase in the history of the program.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, taxpayers earning between $10,000 and $31,000 were eligible,
depending on the number of children they have. The average 1998 claim was $1,459
for 19.4 million taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans, stung by Clinton's veto of their $792 billion tax package last
year, have scaled back hopes for a massive tax cut this year. Instead, they are
drawing up a far more modest package of educational tax breaks and
marriage-penalty relief.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's initiative would expand the maximum credit for working families
with three or more children by roughly $500 in 2002, according to the White
House. The maximum credit in that category would go from $3,992 to $4,491.
</P>
<P>
	   Further, married couples would be allowed to earn more before their credit
was phased out. A married, two-wage couple with children could earn up to
$14,480 in 2001 and still receive the maximum credit, compared with the $13,030
threshold under current law. The provision would give the couple an additional
$250 benefit.
</P>
<P>
	   Another provision would allow families with two or more children to retain
more of the credit after they earn the maximum allowed. Under current law, the
credit is reduced by 21 percent for each dollar earned above the ceiling.
Clinton's proposal would lower the phase-out rate to 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The earned-income tax credit became a political football last year when
House Republicans, in a drive to save money, urged converting payments of the
credit from a lump sum to monthly installments, arguing they could save $8.7
billion in fiscal 2000. The idea collapsed under a veto pledge from Clinton and
criticism from Republican presidential front-runner George W. Bush, who said
such a change might hurt the working poor.
</P>
<P>
	   White House officials have said Clinton, in his Jan. 27 speech, will offer
an array of tax breaks roughly the same size as the $322 billion of initiatives
over 10 years that he recommended to Congress last year. Clinton's program is
expected to include a plan he put forward last year to encourage Americans to
put aside money for retirement.

<HEADLINE> Ernest Hemingway letter stolen from home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WESTPORT, Conn. (AP) - A letter penned by author Ernest Hemingway was
reported stolen from the home of a friend and biographer.
<P>
	   A.E. Hotchner said he noticed the letter missing from his collection last
summer, shortly before he received a phone call from John Resnikoff, a local
antiques dealer. Resnikoff said he had just purchased a letter written to
Hotchner from Hemingway.
</P>
<P>
	   "Before I got back to him, he had sold it to an art collector in New York,"
Hotchner told The Associated Press on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   When the collector failed to respond to letters from Resnikoff, Hotchner or
his attorney, Hotchner decided to call police.
</P>
<P>
	   Hotchner would not identify the collector.
</P>
<P>
	   Hotchner said Resnikoff bought the letter from another dealer, who had
acquired it from another dealer, who claimed he got it from a man "whose name he
couldn't remember, who had moved to Peru," Hotchner said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hotchner said the one-page, handwritten letter was penned during the filming
of the movie version of "Old Man and the Sea." He said it had been appraised at
about $6,000.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was writing me about how about they were preparing to shoot and they
were tied up by waiting for Spencer Tracy to show up; and he was grousing about
the whole thing," Hotchner said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hotchner, who wrote the biography "Papa Hemingway, a Personal Memoir," in
December donated his entire collection of letters, photos and recordings of
Hemingway to the Library of Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   He said they will be given the missing letter if it is returned.
</P>
<P>
	   Hotchner and actor Paul Newman are the cofounders of the Newman's Own food
company and the Hole-in-the-Wall Gang Camp for seriously ill children.

<HEADLINE> Rite Aid To Delay Financial Reports  </HEADLINE>
    By HOPE YEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Rite Aid Corp. says it plans to delay release of
several scheduled financial reports until July, a decision that sent its stock
plummeting 24 percent after a halt in trading earlier today.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York Stock Exchange halted trading for about an hour this morning
amid reports that it may delist Rite Aid. But in a statement, NYSE later said it
would not delist "at this time," though it was closely monitoring the situation.
</P>
<P>
	   A NYSE representative did not immediately return phone calls this afternoon.
Rite Aid shares were trading at $8.06 1/4, down $2.56 1/4.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation's third-largest pharmacy chain announced late Tuesday it had
reached agreement with its lenders on the delay and planned to seek extensions
on Securities and Exchange Commission filings for the remaining quarterly and
annual reports for fiscal year 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Rite Aid's third quarter report for the period ending Nov. 27 was due
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "We believe it's a responsible action to take," said vice president Karen
Rugen. "We've had a new management team for a month, we've had new auditors for
just a few weeks, and with all the delays with the reaudit of '97, '98 and '99,
we realized we didn't have enough time."
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement didn't assuage analysts' concerns, however.
</P>
<P>
	   "The move tells me that the problems run pretty deep and that there is no
easy solution to remedying the problems with Rite Aid's former internal
accounting methodologies," said Steven Valiquette of Warburg Dillon Read.
</P>
<P>
	   The Camp Hill-based chain has been trying to recover after financial woes
sent the company's stock tumbling by more than 80 percent in a year. Former top
executive Martin L. Grass was ousted in October, and a new team led by CEO
Robert Miller has pledged to improve profitability with stricter financial
controls and strategic marketing.
</P>
<P>
	   Rite Aid also has switched auditing firms and a restatement of its earnings
for the past three years was expected to result in a $500 million reduction.
</P>
<P>
	   Valiquette said Rite Aid's move is a possible setback for the company.
</P>
<P>
	   "It takes the wind out of their sails in the short term, to the extent the
company had some momentum after announcement of its new management team," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   John Ransom of Raymond James &AMP; Associates agreed, citing figures on Rite
Aid's same-store sales released Tuesday showing a 5.9 percent increase. That was
a poor performance compared to the double-digit growth of Walgreen's and CVS, he
said. Same-store comparisons measure sales growth excluding the impact of newly
opened stores.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the double whammy of weak December sales and a likely black hole of
information doesn't help," Ransom said. "I doubt any investors are betting on a
quick and easy turnaround."

<HEADLINE> Boeing, Hughes Stock Climb on Rumor  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL WHITE AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Reports that Boeing Co., the world's biggest airplane
maker, will buy Hughes Electronics Corp.'s satellite manufacturing operations
pushed up the stock of both companies today.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes shares jumped $4.18 3/4 to $107.37 1/2 in early afternoon trading,
while Boeing stock was nudged up 43 3/4 cents to $43.31 1/4 on the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   The long-rumored deal would make Boeing a dominant player in the commercial
satellite industry, now led by Hughes. Hughes, which is owned by General Motors
Corp., would be allowed to focus on its fast-growing DirecTV satellite-to-home
entertainment business.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes shares trade separately from regular GM shares.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing plans to buy the satellite-making operations for $4 billion,
according to a Dow Jones Newswires report citing unidentified sources familiar
with the deal.
</P>
<P>
	   Spokesman for Boeing and Hughes declined to comment on the report.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing wants to position itself broadly in the aerospace market, said Jon
Kutler, president of Quarterdeck Investment Partners, an investment bank
specializing in aerospace acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
	   The move would reduce its dependency on jet airliner sales, and put the
company in position to capitalize on the growing demand for commercial
satellites. The purchase also would reflect some uncertainty on Boeing's part as
to which areas of aerospace will become the most lucrative in the next century,
Kutler said.
</P>
<P>
	   "For Boeing, it's hard to sit here and decide which way things are going to
go, and they want to be represented across the board," Kutler said. "They're
trying to have their arms in most of the major areas of the space market in
order to be well-positioned regardless of how the market goes."
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes shares have more than doubled during the past year, driven by the
growth of DirecTV. The service, with more than 8 million subscribers, had
revenue of $1.05 billion in the third quarter, up from $408 million in the third
quarter of 1998.

<HEADLINE> Novelist Bellow, 84, Has Baby Girl  </HEADLINE>
    By ERICA NOONAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- At 84, Nobel Prize-winning novelist Saul Bellow is the father
of a baby girl.
</P>
<P>
	   Bellow's fifth wife, Janis Freedman, 41, gave birth on Dec. 23, according to
sources close to the family. The child's name, her weight and the name of the
hospital where she was born were not available.
</P>
<P>
	   Bellow has three grown sons from previous marriages and several
grandchildren. This was his first child with Ms. Freedman.
</P>
<P>
	   Born in Montreal to Russian immigrants, Bellow spent more than 50 years
living in and writing about Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1993, Bellow stunned the literary and academic world by joining the
faculty of Boston University, which offered positions to him and Ms. Freedman,
who holds a doctorate in the humanities.
</P>
<P>
	   Bellow is the author of 18 novels, including "Seize the Day," "Henderson the
Rain King," "Mr. Sammler's Planet," "The Adventures of Augie March" and
"Herzog." He also won three National Book Awards and the Pulitzer Prize for
"Humbolt's Gift," published in 1975.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Bellow has consistently been critically and popularly received,
many readers have found his books too complex.
</P>
<P>
	   "A great many people seem to view me as a very good writer who is very
difficult to read," Bellow once said.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, Bellow and BU professor Keith Botsford launched a quarterly
literary magazine, The Republic of Letters, filled with the writings from
well-known and undiscovered writers.
</P>
<P>
	   Bellow lives with his wife and daughter outside of Boston.

the top film distributor worldwide with $2.6 billion in ticket
sales and No. 1 domestically with $1.24 billion. The studio's 1999

	   Judge Orders More Northwest Talks
</P>
<P>
	   ST. PAUL. Minn. (AP) -- A federal judge has ordered Northwest
Airlines and its flight attendants union to resume private
negotiations, even though the National Mediation Board has
scheduled no talks. U.S. District Judge Donovan Frank ordered the
two sides to pick a private mediator by Friday or provide him with
a list of acceptable mediators. The judge said he wanted to see
either a tentative agreement by Feb. 4 or a ``detailed'' list of
issues between the two sides and ordered both sides back to his
courtroom Feb. 15-16 to present evidence.

	   Ford Phases In Side Air-Bag System
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. is phasing in side air-bag
curtains on sport utility vehicles that are designed to cover the
windows to prevent the ejection of passengers in rollover crashes.
The new system, made public today at the Detroit auto show, will be
phased in on SUVs within three years starting with some 2001 models
as optional equipment, Ford officials said. In designing the
system, Ford is responding to highway crash data that show pickups
and sport utility vehicles, which have a higher center of gravity,
roll over more than cars. Forty-seven percent of all fatalities in
light trucks -- which include SUVs -- result from rollover, according
to the National Highway Traffic Safety

before. It marked a fall of 3.8 percent for the ruble from its
Monday close of 27.7 to the dollar. In addition to ordinary
Russians, economists watch the ruble's rate closely, considering it
the main barometer of the nation's economic health.

<HEADLINE> Pataki budget pushes for control of state Education Dept.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Gov. George Pataki, with a couple of provisions
tucked away in a corner of his executive budget, is mounting a full-scale
assault against the state Education Department again after a disappointing year
for state schools.
<P>
	   Pataki not only wants to take away the department's control over the state
Library, Archives and Museum, he also wants to slash 10 percent of the Education
Department's staff; personally choose the department's commissioner, as well as
its controlling board, the Board of Regents, and the Regents' chancellor.
</P>
<P>
	   He even wants to strip the department of $250,000 in charter school money.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Pataki never specifically mentioned his plans during his State of
the State address last week or in his executive budget address on Tuesday to
legislators. Instead, Pataki focused on the record amount of public school aid
he wants to spend in the next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
	   "By the way, we haven't seen the results from the schools that we should
have expected when you pour this amount of money into them," Pataki told
reporters after his executive budget address Tuesday. That "is why we don't need
just the additional dollars that we're proposing but we need structural reform.
We need accountability."
</P>
<P>
	   State officials got the first test results from the Board of Regents' push
to increase the educational standards in New York last year.
</P>
<P>
	   More than half of the fourth grade students did not pass the Regents' new
English test, a third failed the fourth-grade Math test and a fourth of those
who took the senior English exam needed to graduate have to take it again.
</P>
<P>
	   But Education Commissioner Richard Mills, who was hired by the
Assembly-controlled Board of Regents, didn't like Pataki's education plan.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think this is personal. We have a very good working relationship
with the governor's staff but I certainly don't agree with this proposal," Mills
said. "The Board of Regents has mustered the forces at their command to raise
standards. The Regents have been very persistent about this. I don't see the
logic of that change at all."
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers, especially in the Democrat-controlled Assembly, are unlikely to
go along with Pataki's plan. Pataki has suggested that the Legislature give him
greater control of the state's schools every year since the first year of his
term, Assembly Education Chairman Steven Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Legislature has rejected this autocratic approach to education every
year since," Sanders said. "We will certainly reject it again this year."
</P>
<P>
	   While Pataki has suggested abolishing the Board of Regents before, this is
the first time he has suggested taking away the state Museum, Archives and
Library away from the Education Department, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Joe Conway, a spokesman for Pataki's Budget Division, said all of Pataki's
suggestions were "common-sense" initiatives. The State University of New York
gets more charter school applications than the Education Department and
streamlining the command structure will provide a greater level of
accountability, Pataki's plan says.
</P>
<P>
	   The point behind the initiatives is "producing the best possible result for
the students," Conway said. "This plan would allow the Education Department to
focus its attention where it belongs, on the classrooms."
</P>
<P>
	   But Carole Huxley, the deputy education commissioner for cultural education,
worried about the separation between politics and education. Putting political
appointees in charge of information distribution and education might not be a
good idea, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "A buffer between politics and libraries, public broadcasting, archives and
museums is an important thing," she said.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Economy Embraces Change  </HEADLINE>
    By JOJI SAKURAI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TOKYO (AP) -- Banks crossing over traditional loyalty lines to merge with
rivals. An automaker renowned for its old-school ways seeking a savior from
France. An Internet entrepreneur outshining the industrial old guard.
</P>
<P>
	   In many ways, 1999 was truly the end of an era for Japan -- and after a
decadelong economic downturn, many economists wouldn't have it any other way.
</P>
<P>
	   But the question now facing the world's second-richest nation is whether it
can keep up the momentum.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the year that decides whether we create a new Japan or slip back,"
said Yotaro Kobayashi, head of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts say this year that the economy will finally return to growth thanks
to generous public spending. Other bright signs include a recovery in the stock
market, where the benchmark index rose 36.8 percent in 1999, and a bottoming-out
of corporate bankruptcies.
</P>
<P>
	   But the broader question -- whether dynamic change will give birth to
self-sustained expansion or a return to inertia leads to steady decline -- is
the one that is being watched most avidly.
</P>
<P>
	   Following London's example, Japan is in the process of a broad-ranging "Big
Bang" reform program aimed at pepping up the economy by easing or abolishing
regulations.
</P>
<P>
	   The reforms have been particularly noteworthy in the financial sector, where
struggling brokerages and banks saddled with bad debt had become a major draw on
the economy as a whole.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, regulations in currency exchange were lifted. Fixed commissions
charged by brokerages were scrapped last year and by 2001 banks, insurance
companies and brokerages will be allowed to enter one another's businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Experts say the official goal of a more dynamic marketplace is already
reflected in new thinking among the private sector.
</P>
<P>
	   "Japanese industry is transforming itself drastically," said Kanji Ishii, a
professor of economic history at the Tokyo Keizai University.
</P>
<P>
	   Some examples of that transformation from the past year are, by Japanese
standards, breathtaking:
</P>
<P>
	   --Several top banks announced mergers with rivals, signaling the decline of
the "keiretsu" business groupings that built up the postwar economy. The mergers
demonstrate a shift in emphasis toward profitability and away from the
traditional ethic of group loyalty.
</P>
<P>
	   --Ailing Nissan Motor Co., one of the bastions of Japanese-style enterprise,
accepted a massive cash infusion from France's Renault and invited "cost-killer"
Carlos Ghosn to run its operations. The result is a plan to cut 21,000 jobs,
close five factories and break ties with inefficient suppliers.
</P>
<P>
	   --The success story of the year wasn't a mainstream mogul but entrepreneur
Masayoshi Son, whose Internet colossus Softbank Co. inspired scores of new
info-tech companies and is persuading investors to look into risky, but
potentially lucrative, ideas in relatively untested territory.
</P>
<P>
	   Professor Ishii and others acknowledge Japan still has many areas in which
it lags behind the United States. And, they note, drastically reworking the
economy carries considerable cultural issues.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, the culture that made a cherished axiom out of "a nail that
sticks out will get bashed back in" is now asked to cast laurels at the
enterpreneurial infotech pioneers.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, businesses whose loftiest management principal was loyalty to
employees and business ties are being urged to ruthlessly close factories and
dump cost inefficient partners.
</P>
<P>
	   As such, larger concerns have been raised about the potential downside the
economic bottom line will have for society as a whole.
</P>
<P>
	   Japan's treasured cultural homogeneity has largely been supported by a
homogeneity of wealth. Now, as innovative startup firms sprout up and
restructuring creates record-high unemployment, the possibility of a chasm
between the rich and poor is becoming a real threat.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Japanese feel scuttling time-honed values is too high a cost for
economic prosperity. Even the government waffles between economic shock-therapy
and shielding businesses and workers from the consequences of structural reform.
</P>
<P>
	   And there are, of course, near-term dangers that could stall recovery.
</P>
<P>
	   Private spending in the second quarter of fiscal 1999 dipped 0.3 percent,
showing consumer confidence remains fragile. A strong yen continues to threaten
export-oriented firms, and with a general election due this year the ruling
party might back-peddle on reform.
</P>
<P>
	   But experts generally believe Japan is too far along in its metamorphosis to
go back now.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are seeing a complete rethinking of the postwar Japanese model," said
Peter Morgan, an economist at HSBC Securities. "There will be no return back to
that."

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 51.50; Nasdaq Down 57.68  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today as investors again moved money away
from pricey technology shares and toward blue-chip industrials that perform well
when the economy is growing.
</P>
<P>
	   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up
51.50 at 11,562.58, narrowly higher than its closing record of 11,572.20 set on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were slightly lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 4.52 at 1,434.04, and the Nasdaq composite index was off 57.68 at
3,863.51.
</P>
<P>
	   Yahoo! led a decline in Internet stocks. Shares of the Internet search
engine fell 31 3/8 to 366 a day after the company posted a better-than-expected
profit report. Yahoo! said late Tuesday it earned 19 cents per share in the
fourth quarter, above Wall Street's prediction of 15 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
	   But company officials warned in a conference call that Yahoo!'s strong
revenue growth is not sustainable, and that prompted investors to sell shares
today.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, Microsoft fell 4 1/16 to 105 5/16 and Oracle fell 6 1/8 to 106 1/4.
</P>
<P>
	   With technology stocks slipping, investors once again sought out relative
bargains in the industrial and consumer goods sectors. After lagging behind the
high-flying Nasdaq in the second half of 1999, the Dow Jones industrials have
outstripped other market measures so far this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, 3M rose 1 13/16 to 102 5/16, and Merck rose 1 5/8 to 74 5/8.
</P>
<P>
	   The broadening of the market beyond its earlier focus on high-tech has
created a healthier environment for investors, many analysts believe.
</P>
<P>
	   "Breadth has improved dramatically this year," said Gregory Nie, technical
analyst at First Union Securities in Chicago. "This market has a good enough,
healthy enough underpinning to support a real rally."
</P>
<P>
	   Still, stocks may struggle in the next two sessions as investors await the
next round of economic indicators. On Thursday, the government will report on
producer prices for December, as well as retail sales. On Friday, the Labor
Department will release its Consumer Price Index, a widely watched gauge of
inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   The reports should offer some indication of the Federal Reserve's next move
on interest rates. Many analysts believe the Fed will raise rates at its next
meeting on Feb. 1 and 2, and may impose further hikes later in the year to keep
inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
	   Higher interest rates can hurt stocks by cutting into corporate profits as
it becomes more expensive to borrow money.
</P>
<P>
	   Bond investors, highly sensitive to inflation and short-term rate changes,
today sent the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond to 6.71 percent from 6.67
percent late Tuesday. Bond yields are now at their highest levels since
September 1997, pressuring stocks by offering lucrative, fixed returns.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-5 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 785.21 million shares, behind Tuesday
afternoon's pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 2.82 to 489.85.

<HEADLINE> Portnoy's complaint: Legislators don't like names named  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - No matter how the criminal case against tobacco
lobbyist Sharon Portnoy goes, the revelations surrounding her activities already
represent a low point in the state Legislature's recent history.
<P>
	   A deposition she gave on Nov. 10 about her activities on behalf of Philip
Morris was released this week by the state Lobbying Commission and it is a tough
read for anyone who believes that selflessness is the motivation for a career in
public service for many of New York state's legislators.
</P>
<P>
	   In her deposition, Portnoy admits to repeatedly doctoring the spending
reports she was required to make to the Lobbying Commission from 1996-99 by
falsely adding the names of fellow lobbyists who had attended dinners,
receptions and other events with lawmakers. Those other lobbyists were not
actually on hand, Portnoy testified.
</P>
<P>
	   But by adding the other names, Portnoy was able to divide the total amount
spent at those events by more people and thus get the per-person costs under
$75. She considered that crucial because it prevented her from having to list
the names of the dozens of individual legislators she was wining and dining in
reports to the Lobbying Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   Lobbyists only have to name names when they spend more than $75 per event on
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   For people cynical of government, Portnoy's activities are doubly troubling.
</P>
<P>
	   First, as she admits repeatedly during her deposition, it was well
understood among lobbyists that state legislators didn't like their names
turning up in lobbyists' reports to the state commission. That was even more
true when the lobbyist paying for dinners, drinks, tickets and so forth was
Philip Morris, a giant in the much-maligned tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was thinking in terms of not embarrassing legislators by naming them on a
lobbying report," she told Lobbying Commission officials. At another point, she
said she felt "compelled" not to "put the legislator in the position of having
their name listed on the lobbying report."
</P>
<P>
	   The lengths Portnoy went to maintain the appearance that legislators were
staying beneath the $75 spending limit suggest that moderation was not on many
lawmakers' minds when they knew Philip Morris was picking up the tab.
</P>
<P>
	   For instance, for a March 1997 reception at the fancy Nicole's Bistro
restaurant in Albany, Portnoy admitted adding the names of 12 people who weren't
actually there in order to make the per-person spending numbers work out right.
</P>
<P>
	   For another night out a week later at the same restaurant with legislators,
she doctored the books with the names of 11 people who were not on hand.
</P>
<P>
	   What such instances suggest, according to Blair Horner of the New York
Public Interest Research Group, is that these parties were extremely lavish and
that many legislators almost certainly consumed drinks and food worth far more
than $75.
</P>
<P>
	   Privately, some legislators who attended Portnoy's events insisted that they
were simply not that extravagant and they wondered how they could have cost
thousands of dollars to mount.
</P>
<P>
	   Then there were the smaller, quirkier events Portnoy had Philip Morris pay
for, such as the little get-together for Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver. It
featured bagels - $629 worth - and was catered by Mom's Bagels.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked by the executive director of the Lobbying Commission, David Grandeau,
how she could spend that kind of money on bagels, Portnoy said it wasn't just
bagels. There was smoked fish and poached salmon and since Assembly Speaker
Sheldon Silver, a devout Jew, was the guest of honor the caterers also had to
provide kosher dishes and flatware, Portnoy explained.
</P>
<P>
	   Portnoy's deposition and other documents in the Lobbying Commission's case
against her have been turned over to Albany County District Attorney Sol
Greenberg's office for possible criminal prosecution. She and Philip Morris were
fined late last year by the commission and Portnoy was banned from lobbying in
New York state for three years.
</P>
<P>
	   She had been paid a base salary of $132,500 plus annual bonuses. In 1998,
that bonus was $45,000, she told the lobbying commission.
</P>
<P>
	   She could face a misdemeanor, a $1,000 fine and up to one year in jail if
Greenberg's office wins a conviction against her.
</P>
<P>
	   Portnoy told the commission that she brought her troubles on herself, that
other lobbyists did not know she was claiming they were at certain events and
that she was not asked to falsify records by Philip Morris or legislators.
</P>
<P>
	   Did it ever happen, Grandeau wondered during Portnoy's deposition, that
state legislators actually insisted on paying for their own food and drinks at
one of her events?
</P>
<P>
	   "No, not that I can recall," she replied.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, Portnoy filed an addendum to her deposition to say that
statement wasn't accurate. She said she could recall two state legislators
offering to pay for a portion of their dinners.

<HEADLINE> Some NYPD cars to be equipped with cameras  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Better mind your manners the next time you're pulled
over by a highway cop in the city. That goes for police as well.
<P>
	   Starting next week, 33 NYPD highway patrol cruisers will hit the road
installed with small video cameras to record the officers' every move - as well
as the actions of people they stop.
</P>
<P>
	   The NYPD comes late to this bit of technology. Many other police departments
nationwide have had such devices in their patrol cars for more than 10 years.
Police Commissioner Howard Safir, head of the department since 1996, said
Wednesday he's not certain why it took so long for the NYPD to use cameras.
</P>
<P>
	   "But I'm very committed to technology - this is something we ought to be
doing," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Meyers, director of the New York Civil Rights Coalition, said the
cameras can't hurt. "It will be there as another reminder to the cops - like the
Miranda warning," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Meyers added: "There's no telling what can happen outside the range of
the camera."
</P>
<P>
	   Safir says he's certain the cameras will protect citizens and officers. A
field test begins next week.
</P>
<P>
	   "It will give good corroboration to violations and I think it will be very
protective of the officers," he said. "Let's face it. No one likes to get a
summons, and many people who get summonses make allegations against police
officers of being discourteous, of being abusive, of using excessive force. This
will be a video record of what actually took place."
</P>
<P>
	   The small camera, which costs $4,500, is attached to the rear view window.
Officers wear a wireless microphone clipped to a recorder attached to their
belts to capture any words exchanged up to 500 feet from the car.
</P>
<P>
	   The camera is activated when the police car's lights and sirens go on. The
officer turns on the microphone and recorder while getting out of the car. A
button can be used to zoom in on a license plate.
</P>
<P>
	   Officers can also coordinate the videotape with the car's radar device,
which can record the speed of the car right on the tape, Safir added.
</P>
<P>
	   The videotape is in the locked trunk. The only person who has the key is the
officer's supervisor. At the end of every tour, the tape, able to record for six
hours, is retrieved. The NYPD's legal department is researching how long the
tapes should be kept before being destroyed.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, officers seem receptive to the cameras, Safir said. And, if the test
period proves successful, every highway patrol car will be equipped with
cameras. In the future, officials will evaluate whether the cameras should be in
other patrol vehicles.

<HEADLINE> GOP Chooses Moderates for Response  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two of the Senate's newest, youngest and least partisan
Republicans have the high-profile task of giving their party's response
following President Clinton's State of the Union address later this month.
</P>
<P>
	   Sens. Bill Frist of Tennessee and Susan Collins of Maine, both 47-year-old
freshmen known for their non-confrontational styles, will get a unique
opportunity to portray the policies and image of the Republican Party following
Clinton's Jan. 27 speech to Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., in selecting the two, emphasized
their expertise in education and health care issues, two major legislative
battlegrounds in this year's session.
</P>
<P>
	   But Lott also is following the example set by House Republican leaders last
year, when they chose a personably pleasing pair of lawmakers, former NFL
football star Steve Largent of Oklahoma and Jennifer Dunn of Washington, to be
the face of the party responding to Clinton's annual speech.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a real effort on the part of the Republican leadership to put
forward the people in the party who are attractive, who are not threatening
characters,'' said Rutgers University professor Ross Baker, who studies
Congress. ``They want to put the lie to the argument that the party is made up
of flinty-eyed ideologues.''
</P>
<P>
	   John Czwartacki, Lott's spokesman, stressed that ``resume really drove this
decision'' -- Frist, as the Senate's only physician, is one of the party's most
authoritative experts on health care issues and Collins has focused on education
policies since she came to Washington in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   But Czwartacki added that the pair, ``like many senators, many members of
our caucus, look like America ... The two of them both by experience and
appearance come across as effective spokespeople.''
</P>
<P>
	   Frist, a heart-lung transplant surgeon in Nashville before his election to
the Senate in 1994, is the more conservative of the two. He wants private
savings accounts to be a part of Social Security system reform and has
championed the GOP version of a patient's bill of rights bill that, unlike
Democratic-backed bills, would limit a patient's rights to sue a managed care
provider.
</P>
<P>
	   But Frist, who gained a moment of fame in July 1998 when he treated the
wounded gunman who killed two Capitol Hill police officers, has also worked
closely with Democrats on education and health issues, and leads a bipartisan
group working toward Medicare reform.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He'd rather reach out than waste valuable time bickering,'' said his press
secretary, Margaret Camp.
</P>
<P>
	   Frist's State of the Union response will give him national exposure at a
time when he is gearing up for his re-election campaign, but Frist, who defeated
three-term Democratic Sen. James Sasser in 1994, does not appear to face a
serious challenge.
</P>
<P>
	   Collins is in the moderate tradition of her old Senate boss, former Maine
senator and current Defense Secretary William Cohen. She has led her party's
efforts to loosen federal controls over education money, but has also differed
with most Republicans by supporting abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Collins attracted national attention twice this year -- first during
Clinton's impeachment trial when she unsuccessfully pushed a plan to find
Clinton guilty without removing him from office and second when she sponsored
popular legislation to stop sweepstakes company deceptions. She was one of five
Republican senators to vote not guilty on both articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
	   Her role models are people who ``knew that you have to cooperate and have
consensus to get anything done,'' said her spokeswoman, Felicia Knight.
``Reasonable is the perfect word for her.''

<HEADLINE> Pataki budget pushes for control of state Education Dept.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Gov. George Pataki, with a couple of provisions
tucked away in a corner of his executive budget, is mounting a full-scale
assault against the state Education Department again after a disappointing year
for state schools.
<P>
	   Pataki not only wants to take away the department's control over the state
Library, Archives and Museum, he also wants to slash 10 percent of the Education
Department's staff; personally choose the department's commissioner, as well as
its controlling board, the Board of Regents, and the Regents' chancellor.
</P>
<P>
	   He even wants to strip the department of $250,000 in charter school money.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Pataki never specifically mentioned his plans during his State of
the State address last week or in his executive budget address on Tuesday to
legislators. Instead, Pataki focused on the record amount of public school aid
he wants to spend in the next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
	   "By the way, we haven't seen the results from the schools that we should
have expected when you pour this amount of money into them," Pataki told
reporters after his executive budget address Tuesday. That "is why we don't need
just the additional dollars that we're proposing but we need structural reform.
We need accountability."
</P>
<P>
	   State officials got the first test results from the Board of Regents' push
to increase the educational standards in New York last year.
</P>
<P>
	   More than half of the fourth grade students did not pass the Regents' new
English test, a third failed the fourth-grade Math test and a fourth of those
who took the senior English exam needed to graduate have to take it again.
</P>
<P>
	   But Education Commissioner Richard Mills, who was hired by the
Assembly-controlled Board of Regents, didn't like Pataki's education plan.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think this is personal. We have a very good working relationship
with the governor's staff but I certainly don't agree with this proposal," Mills
said. "The Board of Regents has mustered the forces at their command to raise
standards. The Regents have been very persistent about this. I don't see the
logic of that change at all."
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers, especially in the Democrat-controlled Assembly, are unlikely to
go along with Pataki's plan. Pataki has suggested that the Legislature give him
greater control of the state's schools every year since the first year of his
term, Assembly Education Chairman Steven Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Legislature has rejected this autocratic approach to education every
year since," Sanders said. "We will certainly reject it again this year."
</P>
<P>
	   While Pataki has suggested abolishing the Board of Regents before, this is
the first time he has suggested taking away the state Museum, Archives and
Library away from the Education Department, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Joe Conway, a spokesman for Pataki's Budget Division, said all of Pataki's
suggestions were "common-sense" initiatives. The State University of New York
gets more charter school applications than the Education Department and
streamlining the command structure will provide a greater level of
accountability, Pataki's plan says.
</P>
<P>
	   The 10 percent reduction Pataki wants would only be 18 employees from the
department's Office of Management Services and Elementary, Middle, Secondary and
Continuing Education divisions, which would be accomplished through attrition,
Conway said. "We would rather spend general fund dollars on the classrooms, not
on the bureaucracy," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The point behind the initiatives is "producing the best possible result for
the students," Conway said. "This plan would allow the Education Department to
focus its attention where it belongs, on the classrooms."
</P>
<P>
	   But Carole Huxley, the deputy education commissioner for cultural education,
worried about the separation between politics and education. Putting political
appointees in charge of information distribution and education might not be a
good idea, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "A buffer between politics and libraries, public broadcasting, archives and
museums is an important thing," she said.

<HEADLINE> Sale of Radioactive Metals Canceled  </HEADLINE>
   By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Energy Department retreated Wednesday from plans to
sell thousands of tons of radioactive metal from its weapons production
facilities as scrap, saying the potential health concerns need to be more
clearly examined.
</P>
<P>
	   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson blocked plans to sell 6,000 tons of nickel
taken from a defunct uranium enrichment plant at Oak Ridge, Tenn., thus keeping
it out of civilian commerce.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the department also was developing a formal policy to prevent the
future sale of 10,000 additional tons of radioactive metals, mostly nickel, at
other Energy Department facilities.
</P>
<P>
	   The action applies to ``volumetrically contaminated'' scrap metals -- mostly
nickel -- that have radioactivity imbedded throughout, and not just on the
surface. Some nuclear watchdog groups have argued that the more than 120,000
tons of scrap metals with surface contamination also should be kept out of the
civilian market.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers who have pressed the administration to abandon the recycling
program applauded Richardson's action.
</P>
<P>
	   The sale of the nickel at Oak Ridge ``could have put U.S. workers, consumers
and steel producers in a very precarious situation,'' said Rep. Ron Klink,
D-Pa..
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., said ``common sense is finally beginning to take
hold.''
</P>
<P>
	   British Nuclear Fuel Inc., which is under DOE contract to clean up the Oak
Ridge facility, planned to sell the nickel to private buyers for $41 million
later this year. The company contended the nickel could be cleaned to the point
that it no longer would pose a health risk.
</P>
<P>
	   The sale had been approved by the state of Tennessee and in 1997 by the
federal Energy Department.
</P>
<P>
	   But it prompted criticism from nuclear watchdog groups, members of Congress
and some leaders of the steel industry, who were concerned about having to
explain to consumers why their products contained radioactive metals, even in
low doses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This plan had all the makings of being penny-wise and pond foolish,'' said
Klink in a statement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson said he was modifying the government's contract with British
Nuclear Fuel to block the impending sale at Oak Ridge or any future release of
similarly contaminated metals -- primarily nickel -- into the open market.
</P>
<P>
	   The long-range policy will cover not only the nickel at Oak Ridge but also
10,000 tons of metals -- mostly nickel -- being kept primarily at the Portsmouth
Gaseous Diffusion plant in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This will give the Nuclear Regulatory Commission time to develop national
standards for volumetrically contaminated materials ... (and) it will allow DOE
to examine alternatives to free release,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
	   It was unclear when the NRC planned to consider a proposed standard for such
scrap metals. The NRC regulates consumer products where radiation has been
intentionally added, but has said the state had jurisdiction over the planned
nickel recycling at Oak Ridge.
</P>
<P>
	   While materials with surface contamination often can be cleaned, it is
unclear whether radioactivity that permeates a metal can be removed sufficiently
removed.
</P>
<P>
	   Meantime some critics said Richardson was taking only half measures because
he does not address the recycling of scrap metals and other materials -- some
120,000 tons at DOE weapons facilities -- that contain only surface radiation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we're concerned about is this will be just window dressing,'' said
David Adelman, an attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, which sued
to try to stop the recycling.
</P>
<P>
	   Wenonah Hauter, director of the Public Citizen Critical Mass Energy Project,
a nuclear watchdog group, said: ``Even if you believe that metal contaminated on
the surface by radioactive isotopes can be adequately cleaned, and we believe it
can't, who would possibly believe DOE can competently carry out a radioactive
recycling program?''

<HEADLINE> European Stocks End Mixed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- European stocks ended mixed Wednesday, weighed down by
expectations of interest-rate hikes by the European Central bank, the Federal
Reserve and the Bank of England.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 606 shares in European companies ended almost
uncganged, slipping 0.01 point to 362.92, while the Dow Jones Stoxx 50 Index
rose 0.8 point to 4463.4.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index, which tracks 313 companies from the
countries that have adoped the single currency, fell 1.15 points to 398.27. The
Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index fell 22.2 points to 4649.3.
</P>
<P>
	   The markets struggled amid expectations The Bank of England will raise
interest rates on Thursday, speculation that adversely affected shares of banks,
mortgage lenders and retailers.
</P>
<P>
	   European investors were also expecting the Federal Reserve to increase U.S.
rates on Feb. 2, while stronger-than-expected French consumer price figures for
last year have raised expectations for a European Central Bank rate increase as
well.
</P>
<P>
	   But London shares made late gains amid speculation about Internet-related
acquisitions by Cable and Wireless with the merger agreement between America
Online and Time Warner sending more ripples through European media and telecom
sectors. Frankfurt also ended on the positive side amid late buying of telecom
stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   London's FTSE-100 Share Index rose 13.9 points, or 0.2 percent, to 6,532.8,
Frankfurt's Xetra DAX Index added 21.56 points, or 0.3 percent, to 6912.81, and

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton campaign asks for soft-money summit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign manager invited
his counterpart on Rudolph Giuliani's political team on Wednesday to negotiate a
mutual ban on the use of unlimited soft-money contributions in their expected
Senate race.
<P>
	   But Giuliani campaign chief Bruce Teitelbaum, in a subsequent letter to
Clinton campaign manager Bill deBlasio, said that before any such negotiations
could take place, the first lady would have to refund such money already spent
on her behalf.
</P>
<P>
	   "You should also determine how much soft money you have already raised and
publicly declare that none of that money will be used to benefit the Clinton
campaign in any way," the aide to the Republican mayor of New York City wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate comment from Hillary Clinton's campaign team to the
letter.
</P>
<P>
	   Thus far, the national Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has raised
several hundred thousand dollars in unlimited soft-money donations aimed at
helping Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaign in New York. And, it spent more than
$200,000 to finance television ads across upstate New York late last year
promoting the first lady.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, chairman of the DSCC, said
the committee was prepared to spend "whatever is required to win" New York's
Senate race.
</P>
<P>
	   Under fire for her use of soft money, Mrs. Clinton began pressing Giuliani
at the end of last year to agree to a ban on the use of such funding and to
disavow third-party advocacy advertising in their race. The Giuliani camp
demanded the proposal in writing before entering into such talks.
</P>
<P>
	   Howard Wolfson, spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's campaign team, said Wednesday
that deBlasio had telephoned Teitelbaum Tuesday to discuss the issue, was unable
to get through and left a message. Teitelbaum returned the call Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Bruce said he would talk with his boss and get back to us," Wolfson
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Teitelbaum did so in his letter to deBlasio, and made it public.
</P>
<P>
	   "I agree this is a good opportunity to discuss the role that soft money will
play in the upcoming Senate race," the Giuliani aide wrote. "We must, however,
start the discussion on a level playing field."
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to demanding that Mrs. Clinton pay the cost of the DSCC-financed
TV ads out of her campaign account, Teitelbaum said "it would also be useful if
we could agree on an ironclad, verifiable method of accountability to ensure
that any agreement we reach will be honored throughout the campaign."
</P>
<P>
	   "Because of the soft money you have already raised, and the massive
fund-raising apparatus at your disposal, the issues of verification and trust
are of paramount concern to us," the Giuliani aide added.
</P>
<P>
	   Verification and trust was a concept promoted by President Reagan in his
dealings with the Soviets over arms control.
</P>
<P>
	   While Giuliani has not been actively raising soft money for the Senate race,
he has not ruled out using such funds.
</P>
<P>
	   Under federal rules, Senate candidates can accept no more than $2,000 from
individual contributors to spend on their races. But those same contributors can
give unlimited money to political committees such as the DSCC that can then use
it to promote a candidate, as long as they don't directly ask you to vote for
that candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton appeared with the Rev. Jesse Jackson and U.S.
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers at a conference sponsored by Jackson's "Wall
Street Project."
</P>
<P>
	   At the event, the first lady proposed expanding micro-credit, small loans to
would-be entrepreneurs, and providing more small-business services to upstate
areas.

<HEADLINE> Jail guards plead guilty to fatal beating of Nassau Jail inmate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) - Two Nassau County correction officers pleaded
guilty Wednesday to federal civil rights charges for fatally beating a
recovering heroin addict in his cell at the county jail.
<P>
	   The guards, Patrick Regnier and Edward Velazquez, changed their pleas to
guilty before U.S. District Court Judge Jacob Mishler. They opted to plead after
a third guard cut a deal last week to admit that he served as the lookout on
Jan. 8, 1999, and to testify against his co-workers.
</P>
<P>
	   Velazquez, under questioning from Mishler, admitted that he went to Thomas
Pizzuto's cell "to quiet him down and use unreasonable force if necessary."
</P>
<P>
	   The recovering heroin addict was crying out for his methadone treatment.
Pizzuto, 38, of Hicksville, was serving a 90-day sentence for traffic
violations.
</P>
<P>
	   Three days after the beating, he suffered a seizure and died. The Nassau
County medical examiner found that Pizzuto had suffered a ruptured spleen and
ruled the death a homicide.
</P>
<P>
	   The courtroom was packed for the guilty pleas, with Pizzuto's
wheelchair-bound mother weeping quietly during the 70-minute session.
</P>
<P>
	   The amount of prison time the pair faces at their April 7 sentencing will be
determined by Mishler after conducting a hearing on whether their conduct
amounted to murder or manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
	   A ruling that the death was the result of murder could bring each guard up
to 30 years in prison, while a manslaughter ruling would yield a sentence of
between 3 1/2 and 12 1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Their defense case suffered a major setback last week when a third guard
charged in the case, Ivano Bavaro, pleaded guilty to federal conspiracy and
witness tampering charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Bavaro admitted that he acted as a lookout while Velazquez and Regnier went
into Pizzuto's cell and pounded the inmate into silence.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial against a fourth guard, Joseph Bergen, accused of filing a false
report indicating that Pizzuto had slipped in the shower, will proceed later
this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The East Meadow jail, which houses about 1,800 inmates and is patrolled by
approximately 1,100 guards, has been the subject of numerous allegations of
guard misconduct. Following Pizzuto's death and other allegations of abuse, the
U.S. Department of Justice began an investigation of how inmates there are
treated.
</P>
<P>
	   Last March, a Nassau County correction officer was found liable in the
beating of a mentally retarded jail inmate with a frying pan in 1993. County
officials agreed to a $500,000 settlement in the inmate's civil rights lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheriff Joseph Jablonsky, whose jurisdiction included the jail, retired late
last year. A replacement has yet to be hired.

<HEADLINE> Corn Leads Grains Sharply Higher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures soared Wednesday on the Chicago
Board of Trade after the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported a surprise cut
in its estimate of U.S. corn production.
</P>
<P>
	   The USDA lowered its forecast for the 1999 corn crop by 100 million bushels
to 9.4 billion bushels at a time of year when estimates traditionally rise.
</P>
<P>
	   Corn rocketed to a four-month high, settling up 4 percent for the day, and
other grains and soybeans followed.
</P>
<P>
	   Soybeans also were bolstered by the USDA's projected cut in soybean
production figures.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat prices were buoyed by lower-than-expected quarterly grain stocks and a
slight reduction in winter wheat acreage that pushed U.S. wheat acreage to its
lowest level since the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat for March delivery rose 5 cents to $2.58 3/4 a bushel; March corn rose
8 1/4 cents to $2.15 1/2 a bushel; March oats rose 1 3/4 cents to $1.10 1/4 a
bushel; March soybeans rose 5 3/4 cents to $4.80 1/4 a bushel.
</P>
<P>
	   Beef futures fell on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while pork futures
were mixed.
</P>
<P>
	   February live cattle fell .45 cent to 70.42 cents a pound; March feeder
cattle fell .68 cent to 85.97 cents a pound; February lean hogs fell 1.22 cents
to 54.80 cents a pound; February pork bellies rose .80 cent to 83.15 cents a
pound.

<HEADLINE> Driver's license renewals in New York will require eye exam  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Drivers renewing their licenses in New York state
will have to pass eye exams as of April 1.
<P>
	   In something of a reversal of policy for Gov. George Pataki, his Department
of Motor Vehicles will require eye exams from drivers under a new,
once-every-eight-years license renewal schedule.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, Pataki vetoed legislation which would have required eye exams,
saying the testing would have been too expensive for the DMV to conduct and he
was not convinced of the traffic safety benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   Since Pataki's veto, the DMV's medical advisory board has recommended that
eye exams be reinstituted, Division of Budget spokesman Kevin Quinn said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, the new measure differs from the 1997 legislation in that it will cost
$400,000 a year to administer, instead of $2 million, because renewals will be
done every eight years instead of every five, according to Quinn.
</P>
<P>
	   Since 1994, motorists renewing their licenses have been permitted to do so
by mail by self-certifying that they have acceptable vision. Vision tests are
required for someone getting a license for the first time.
</P>
<P>
	   The state is working on a plan that would allow drivers to mail in
certificates from health care providers attesting to passage of eye tests so
that the drivers wouldn't be required to go to DMV to renew, Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're looking to make this as easy and as customer friendly for drivers as
possible," Quinn said. "Having drivers across the state take vision tests will
certainly improve safety for everyone on New York's roadways."
</P>
<P>
	   Studies have shown that states without vision tests for drivers had higher
accident and death rates, particularly in age groups over 65, said Dr. Robert
Kennedy, president of the New York State Ophthalmological Society.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're happy that the governor has agreed to reinstitute the driver's
license vision testing requirement," Kennedy said. "We're just not sure that
eight years is often enough."
</P>
<P>
	   As long as age is not the determining factor in whether eye exams are
required, then reinstituting the exams is fine, said Michael Burgess, executive
director of the Statewide Senior Action Council.
</P>
<P>
	   "Somebody 45 could have something wrong with their vision or if they've had
illness," Burgess said. "These things should be health-related, not
age-related."
</P>
<P>
	   The measure, which does not require legislative approval, will effect
roughly 2 million motorists a year, but not commercial license holders, Quinn
said. The commercial renewal schedule will stay at five years and eye exams were
already required.
</P>
<P>
	   The $5 annual fee for renewals will not change. Drivers will pay $43 for
eight years, plus an existing $3 photo document fee. Currently, drivers pay $28.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Mixed; Dow Up 40.02  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip industrial stocks once again stole the spotlight
from flashier technology shares, pushing higher today as investors shied away
from the slumping Internet sector.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 40.02 to close at 11,551.10. The Dow
lost some ground late in the session and failed to top Monday's closing record
of 11,572.20.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were lower.
</P>
<P>
	   Yahoo! led a decline in Internet stocks. Shares of the Internet search
engine fell steeply a day after the company posted a better-than-expected profit
report. Yahoo! said late Tuesday it earned 19 cents per share in the fourth
quarter, above Wall Street's prediction of 15 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
	   But company officials warned in a conference call that Yahoo!'s strong
revenue growth is not sustainable. Several Wall Street analysts stepped in to
defend the stock, but investors sold shares nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
	   America Online fell as investors continued to fret about the company's
growth potential once it merges with Time Warner. AOL shares have fallen 19
percent since the company announced its bold move to acquire the more
traditional media company.
</P>
<P>
	   Microsoft also fell. Just before the close of Wall Street's regular session,
The Associated Press reported that government lawyers involved in Microsoft's
antitrust case want the company to break itself into three parts to dilute its
competitive advantage.
</P>
<P>
	   With technology stocks slipping, investors once again sought out relative
bargains in the industrial and consumer goods sectors. After lagging behind the
high-flying Nasdaq in the second half of 1999, the Dow Jones industrials have
outstripped other market measures so far this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, 3M and Merck rose.
</P>
<P>
	   The broadening of the market beyond its earlier focus on high-tech has
created a healthier environment for investors, many analysts believe.
</P>
<P>
	   "Breadth has improved dramatically this year," said Gregory Nie, technical
analyst at First Union Securities in Chicago. "This market has a good enough,
healthy enough underpinning to support a real rally."
</P>
<P>
	   Still, stocks may struggle in the next two sessions as investors await the
next round of economic indicators. On Thursday, the government will report on
producer prices for December, as well as retail sales. On Friday, the Labor
Department will release its Consumer Price Index, a widely watched gauge of
inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   The reports should offer some indication of the Federal Reserve's next move
on interest rates. Many analysts believe the Fed will raise rates at its next
meeting on Feb. 1 and 2, and may impose further hikes later in the year to keep
inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
	   Higher interest rates can hurt stocks by cutting into corporate profits as
it becomes more expensive to borrow money.
</P>
<P>
	   Bond investors, highly sensitive to inflation and short-term rate changes,
today sent the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond to 6.71 percent from 6.67
percent late Tuesday. Bond yields are now at their highest levels since July
1997, pressuring stocks by offering lucrative, fixed returns.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's really not much that's more important to investing than
inflationary expectations and interest rates," said Robert Stovall, president of
Stovall/Twenty-First Advisers in New York. "Stock investors have been able to
brush off rising yields for a while, but at this level, they can't."

<HEADLINE> DEP begins deer hunt at Bluff Point Coastal Reserve  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   GROTON, Conn. (AP) - The state began its hunt of 78 deer at Bluff Point
Coastal Reserve on Wednesday, a day after a judge ruled the state could go ahead
with its plans to kill three-quarters of the deer there.
<P>
	   The hunt began shortly after daybreak Wednesday and was scheduled to
continue on weekdays through Jan. 28.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not clear how many deer were killed Wednesday. Department of
Environmental Protection officials did not return telephone calls seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Mannetti of the New Haven-based Animal Rights Front, had sought to
delay the hunt until a trial is held on the issue next month, said some members
of his group might attempt to disrupt the hunt, as they have previously.
</P>
<P>
	   "Some people feel passionately about this and want to express their feelings
in a dramatic fashion by sabotaging the hunt," he told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   Wednesday morning several protesters were in front of barricades that
blocked the access road into the preserve. They were holding signs, including
one that read "Stop the Slaughter."
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile Derek Oatis, the group's attorney, said he was considering filing
a direct appeal to the state Supreme Court. The rare move is an option on issues
of public interest, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The group sought to use a 1963 state law to prevent the DEP from conducting
the special hunt. The activists argued unsuccessfully that the agency had
violated the law in the past by killing fawns and was likely to do so again.
</P>
<P>
	   At issue in the hearing was when a fawn becomes an adult. The activists
claimed a fawn becomes a deer when it is 1 year old, while the state said deer
are no longer fawns after they lose their spots at about five months.
</P>
<P>
	   After hearing two days of testimony, Berger said the DEP definition is
easier to enforce because hunters cannot easily distinguish between fawns whose
spots have faded and more mature deer.
</P>
<P>
	   The hunt originally was scheduled to begin on Monday but was put on hold
while the judge heard the case.
</P>
<P>
	   The state contends that 78 of the 103 deer at Bluff Point must be killed in
order to protect the fragile flora at the 800-acre preserve.
</P>
<P>
	   "We want a balance," said Ed Parker, chief of the DEP's natural resources
bureau.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bluff Point Reserve and adjacent Bluff Point State Park have been closed
since Monday and are scheduled to remain closed to the public while the hunt is
conducted through Jan. 28. However, the park will be open on weekends and the
Martin Luther King Jr. Holiday.

<HEADLINE> Disney Studio Boss Resigns  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GERMAIN AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Walt Disney studio boss Joe Roth, under whom the company
scored two of its three top films ever last year, said today he is resigning to
form his own independent film outfit.
</P>
<P>
	   Roth will be replaced as Disney studio chairman by Peter Schneider, who has
been the studio president for the last year.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have loved working at Disney, both as an executive and a producer, for
the past seven years, but feel that it is time for me to pursue a more
entrepreneurial, independent life," Roth said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
	   The resignation follows another record year at the box office for Disney,
which was the top film distributor worldwide with $2.6 billion in ticket sales
and No. 1 domestically with $1.24 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The studio's 1999 releases included "The Sixth Sense," which has taken in
$276 million domestically, and "Toy Story 2," which has grossed $220 million.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the first time two films from the same distributor topped the $200
million mark in one year. The movies are second and third on Disney's all-time
list, behind "The Lion King" with $312 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Disney Chairman Michael Eisner said Roth helped maintain the company's
leadership in live-action films. Eisner said he hoped Roth would hook up with
Disney on future films.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have little doubt that Joe and Disney will be working together on
projects in the years to come," Eisner said in the news release.
</P>
<P>
	   As head of studio operations, Roth oversaw film, TV, video and animation
production. Studio chief since 1994, Roth also was responsible for such movies
as "Armageddon," "The Waterboy" and "Enemy of the State."
</P>
<P>
	   Roth's resignation is the latest in a string of high-profile departures of
top Disney brass in the last few years, including two former chief financial
officers, Steve Bollenbach and Richard Nanula, ABC TV and radio station chief
Steve Burke and cable programming boss Geraldine Laybourne.
</P>
<P>
	   Disney also suffered through costly severance settlements with former top
executives Jeffrey Katzenberg and Michael Ovitz.
</P>
<P>
	   Roth took over Disney studio operations after Katzenberg quit. Previously,
Roth had been movie chairman at 20th Century Fox and also ran two independent
film companies, Morgan Creek Productions and Caravan Productions.

<HEADLINE> Mayor Says No To 'The Sopranos'  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID RISING Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Mayor Vincent A. "Buddy" Cianci Jr., a tireless
promoter of his city, was happy to make a cameo appearance on the sentimental
NBC drama "Providence."
</P>
<P>
	   But HBO made him an offer he could refuse.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor of the city once known as New England's mob headquarters rejected
an invitation to participate in a local screening of the season premiere of
HBO's mobster series "The Sopranos."
</P>
<P>
	   He suggested that the show makes Italian-Americans look bad.
</P>
<P>
	   The cable network wanted to buy jars of the Mayor's Own Marinara Sauce,
which Cianci sells for charity, and give them away at the event.
</P>
<P>
	   "To offer my marinara for sale to 'The Sopranos' would be too high a price
to pay, even while adding to my scholarship fund for our Providence students,"
Cianci, who appeared in a first-season episode of "Providence," wrote to HBO.
</P>
<P>
	   "To accept would be to compromise the pride I have for my heritage, my
ethnic background and my strong beliefs that bias against any individual or
group is morally wrong."
</P>
<P>
	   Henry Gomez, HBO corporate affairs vice president, wrote back to say he was
disappointed by Cianci's response. The series' stars -- including James
Gandolfini and Lorraine Bracco -- would never "lend their talents to a program
that disparaged their Italian heritage," Gomez wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Gomez said, out of courtesy to Cianci, HBO canceled the Providence
premiere, set for mid-January. Screenings in about two dozen other cities are
proceeding as planned.
</P>
<P>
	   The New England mob had a strong presence in Rhode Island during its 1970s
heyday. Some brick walls still bear bullet holes from gangland slayings. But the
mob has been greatly weakened over the years, reduced to small-time operations
such as theft rings, authorities say.

<HEADLINE> Court Expands Cops' Right on Flight  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE ASSEO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court on Wednesday gave police broad
authority to stop and question people who run at the sight of an officer.
</P>
<P>
	   The 5-4 ruling came short of giving police a blanket right to stop anyone
who runs after seeing the police. But it said such flight may indicate a crime
is being committed and therefore can help justify a police stop.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision was a boost for police but worried some civil libertarians.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nervous, evasive behavior is a pertinent factor in determining reasonable
suspicion'' to justify a stop, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote for the
court. ``Headlong flight -- wherever it occurs -- is the consummate act of
evasion.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Allowing officers confronted with such flight to stop the fugitive and
investigate further is quite consistent with the individual's right to go about
his business or to stay put and remain silent in the face of police
questioning,'' Rehnquist said.
</P>
<P>
	   The court said police had enough reason to stop a Chicago man who ran after
spotting officers in an area known for narcotics trafficking.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Association of Police Organizations praised the ruling. The
group's executive director, Robert T. Scully, said the decision will allow
police to investigate ``highly suspicious conduct.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Tracey Maclin, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, said the
decision ``shows how out of touch the majority of the court is with what happens
on the streets of America with respect to police-citizen encounters.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``One of the basic liberties of this country is that you've got a right to
say 'no' to the cops,'' Maclin said, adding that the ruling's practical effect
will be to allow police to stop anyone who flees in high-crime areas.
</P>
<P>
	   Rehnquist's opinion was joined by justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin
Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
	   Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen
G. Breyer agreed with the court's decision not to adopt a rule that would always
authorize police to stop people who run at the sight of police.
</P>
<P>
	   But the four, in an opinion written by Stevens, disagreed with the
majority's conclusion that Chicago police were justified in stopping William
Wardlow in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   Wardlow was convicted of a weapons violation after he was chased down and
arrested on a Chicago street while carrying a loaded handgun.
</P>
<P>
	   Eight officers in four cars had converged on an area known for drug
trafficking when Wardlow saw them and took off running. Officers pursued and
cornered him, and found the gun after a pat-down search.
</P>
<P>
	   Wardlow was sentenced to two years in prison for unlawful use of a weapon,
but a state appeals court threw out his conviction and the Illinois Supreme
Court agreed.
</P>
<P>
	   Stevens said prosecutors did not show that police had enough reason to stop
Wardlow.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am not persuaded that the mere fact that someone standing on a sidewalk
looked in the direction of a passing car before starting to run is sufficient to
justify a forcible stop and frisk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Constitution's Fourth Amendment bans unreasonable searches and seizures.
In 1968, the Supreme Court ruled that police can stop and question someone
without a warrant if there is reasonable suspicion the person is involved in a
crime or about to commit one.
</P>
<P>
	   Rehnquist said people sometimes are entitled to ignore the police and go
about their business.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But unprovoked flight is simply not a mere refusal to cooperate,'' the
chief justice said. ``Flight, by its very nature, is not `going about one's
business'; in fact, it is just the opposite.''
</P>
<P>
	   Police decisions on whether to stop someone are not an exact science but
must be based on ``commonsense judgments and inferences about human behavior,''
he said.

<HEADLINE> Astronaut Makes Rommel Remark  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- The commander of NASA's next space shuttle
mission jokingly told German astronaut Gerhard Thiele that ``Rommel would have
been proud of you'' after Thiele drove an armored personnel carrier during
training Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Kevin Kregel made the remark about the Nazi general on a vacant launch pad
at Kennedy Space Center where crew members were practicing shuttle escape
maneuvers. Part of their training includes driving a M-113 armored personnel
carrier away from the launch pad.
</P>
<P>
	   Thiele, who is part of Kregel's six-member crew on space shuttle Endeavour,
laughed when he heard the remark.
</P>
<P>
	   Endeavour is scheduled to launch Jan. 31 for an Earth-mapping mission.
</P>
<P>
	   Erwin Rommel was known as ``The Desert Fox'' during World War II and led
Germany's Afrika Korps against Allied forces in Libya in 1941.
</P>
<P>
	   He repeatedly outmaneuvered his opponents but was overcome by British forces
at El Alamein, Egypt, in 1942. In 1944, Rommel was implicated in a plot to kill
Adolf Hitler and chose to ingest a fatal dose of poison rather than face trial.

<HEADLINE> Ford Offers SUV Rollover Air Bags  </HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. will offer a new safety option in its sport
utility vehicles -- air bags that cover the side windows like curtains to
prevent passengers from being thrown out in rollover crashes.
</P>
<P>
	   The new ai-rbag curtains are Ford's answer to figures showing passengers in
SUVs are four times more likely to be involved in a rollover during a serious
accident than passengers in cars. Most often, rollover deaths involve passengers
being thrown from the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
	   The curtains, unveiled Wednesday during the preview of the North American
International Auto Show, will be phased in on Ford's SUVs.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford said an unspecified model will get the curtains as an option late this
year, and the devices should be available as optional equipment on all of the
automaker's SUVs in about three years.
</P>
<P>
	   No price has been set. Nor would Ford executives talk about putting the
system in pickups, minivans or cars.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 47 percent
of all deaths in light trucks -- which include SUVs -- result from rollovers. In
comparison, 22 percent of car deaths involve rollovers.
</P>
<P>
	   The system has a sensor that can measure the amount of vehicle tilt and
trigger the air-bag curtain. The curtain would deploy downward in milliseconds
from the edge of the roof, covering the side windows along the front and back
rows of seats.
</P>
<P>
	   The curtains, attached to the vehicle with tethers, remain inflated for six
seconds, the amount of time Ford says it takes the average vehicle to roll over
up to three times. The sensor will modulate the force of the airbags depending
on the speed of the vehicle, inflating the curtains faster at higher speeds.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford said the curtains are also intended to reduce head injuries in
side-impact crashes.
</P>
<P>
	   Several automakers, including Mercedes and Volvo, also have air bag curtains
that inflate across the windows. BMW has an air bag that inflates in the shape
of a tube that hangs near the top of the window.
</P>
<P>
	   Those systems are primarily advertised as a means of protecting people's
heads, though the automakers say they could help keep passengers from being
thrown out in a rollover.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ford system is designed specifically for rollover protection.
</P>
<P>
	   Many automakers, including Ford, already have side air-bag systems that
deploy from the seat or door and are designed to protect the head or chest in
side-impact crashes.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford's announcement came as the NHTSA develops a vehicle rollover rating
system expected to be proposed in the next few months. Last year, the agency
started requiring most new SUVs to carry illustrated warning labels declaring
they have a "higher rollover risk" than standard automobiles.

<HEADLINE> Court Protects Drivers' Privacy  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE ASSEO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress can protect motorists' privacy by barring states
from selling the personal information on drivers' licenses, the Supreme Court
ruled Wednesday in rejecting a states' right challenge.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices' unanimous decision ran counter to their recent trend of
reining in Congress' power over the states.
</P>
<P>
	   The case involves South Carolina's challenge to the 1994 Driver's Privacy
Protection Act, enacted in response to the 1989 killing of actress Rebecca
Schaeffer by a stalker who used a private investigator to get her address from
driver's license records.
</P>
<P>
	   The act ``does not require the states in their sovereign capacity to
regulate their own citizens,'' Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote for the
court.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It does not require the South Carolina Legislature to enact any laws or
regulations, and it does not require state officials to assist in the
enforcement of federal statutes regulating private individuals,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The law bars states and their employees from releasing personal information
from motor vehicle records -- including names, addresses, telephone and Social
Security numbers and photographs -- unless someone consents to such release.
</P>
<P>
	   The law's sponsor, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said the ruling means
``Congress has the right to protect the privacy of personal information that
could be used to harm our citizens.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Feminist Majority Foundation called the decision ``a decisive victory''
for protecting women against violence. The law is ``crucial to protecting
workers at abortion clinics,'' where people have used drivers' license numbers
to get workers' home addresses, the group said.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision was criticized by Gregg Leslie, acting executive director of
the Reporters' Committee for Freedom of the Press.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For perhaps 100 years, state legislators have always made these decisions
by balancing privacy with the public need to know,'' Leslie said. ``Then without
research, Congress, reacting to some scares, made a sweeping decision to deny
access to all this information.''
</P>
<P>
	   States routinely have sold drivers' license information to businesses and
political candidates, earning millions of dollars in revenue each year. When
Congress enacted the law, 34 states made drivers' license records public in some
form.
</P>
<P>
	   The law includes exceptions, allowing such information to be disclosed to
law enforcement officials, courts, government agencies and private
investigators. No exemption is included for the news media.
</P>
<P>
	   South Carolina argued that Congress' power to regulate interstate commerce
did not give it the authority to govern the release of such state records. The
4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Department lawyers argued to the Supreme Court that releasing
drivers' license records means people are forced to provide the key to their
personal information on their license plates.
</P>
<P>
	   Rehnquist's opinion distinguished the case from a 1997 dispute in which the
justices decided Congress could not force the states to conduct background
checks on prospective gun buyers.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Wednesday's case was more like a 1988 ruling in which the Supreme
Court upheld a law that barred states from issuing unregistered bonds. The law
regulated state activities but did not try to control how states regulate
private parties, the court said at the time.

<HEADLINE> Silver pushes new campaign finance limits  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The state Assembly's Democratic majority called
Wednesday for banning fund-raising events for state office candidates held
within 40 miles of the state Capitol during annual legislative sessions.
<P>
	   In wide-ranging campaign finance reform legislation, the Assembly Democrats
also proposed limits on the amount of money political party committees could
transfer to such state office candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   For instance, party committees could only give $700,000 to candidates for
governor; $50,000 to state Senate candidates; and $25,000 to Assembly candidates
under the Assembly majority's proposal. There are currently no such limits.
</P>
<P>
	   The measure, which stands almost no chance of becoming law in its current
form, also renews the Assembly Democratic majority's past calls for partial
public financing of campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   "As we enter the 21st century, it is incumbent upon elected officials to
face directly the challenge of campaign finance reform and come up with a system
that is equitable and fair to the public," Stephen Kaufman, a Bronx Democrat who
is chairman of the Assembly's Election Law Committee, said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Assembly leadership indicated the proposal to ban fund-raising events in
the Albany area during legislative sessions was aimed at the practice of
politicians hitting up lobbyists and their clients for money at a time when they
want want to influence legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   In June, Gov. George Pataki unveiled his own sweeping campaign finance
proposal that would have barred fund-raising events from even being held within
25 miles of the state Capitol during the annual legislative session that
normally runs from early January through June or July.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pataki plan would also eliminate the unlimited "soft-money" donations
special interests can give to political parties and impose lower campaign
contribution limits for all state office races. The Republican governor did not
call for public campaign financing.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither the Democratic-led Assembly or the Republican-controlled Senate has
acted on the governor's proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   In announcing its campaign finance proposal, the Assembly Democrats called
on the Senate GOP majority to approve the governor's plan and then allow a joint
Assembly-Senate conference committee to work out compromise legislation
acceptable to both chambers.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, a Rensselaer County Republican, said
Wednesday that his GOP Senate colleagues would be unveiling their own campaign
finance proposal. He gave no timetable for when that plan might be made public.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno did take a jab at the Assembly Democrats, noting that they have
refused to go along with legislation approved by the Senate to bar all gifts
over $25 from lobbyists. The Senate leader noted that the senators have agreed
to abide by that ban voluntarily even without Assembly approval of the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno said Wednesday that in that same spirit, the Assembly Democrats should
pass their campaign finance plan and then voluntarily abide by its restrictions,
even without agreement from the Senate.

<HEADLINE> Today's Supreme Court Actions  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   The Supreme Court took these actions Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
	   --Gave police wide power to stop and question people who run at the sight of
a police officer. The 5-4 ruling in a Chicago case did not give police a blanket
right to stop anyone who runs upon seeing the police, but it said such flight
can help create enough suspicion of criminal activity to justify a stop.
</P>
<P>
	   --Heard arguments over whether grandparents can be given a broad right to
seek court-ordered visitation with their grandchildren over the parents'
objections. Most justices voiced concerns about a Washington state law that
allowed ``any person,'' relative or nonrelative, to such visitation rights
whenever it was found to be in a child's best interest.
</P>
<P>
	   --Ruled unanimously that Congress can protect motorists' privacy by barring
states from selling the personal information on drivers' licenses. The justices
rejected South Carolina's argument that the law violated states' rights.
</P>
<P>
	   --Upheld the right of citizen groups to sue alleged polluters under the
Clean Water Act even though any financial damages awarded would be paid to the
federal government. The 7-2 ruling also said polluters sued by private citizens
under federal environmental laws cannot necessarily avoid paying damages by
stopping their misconduct while the case is ongoing.
</P>
<P>
	   --Ruled unanimously that people convicted of a crime do not have a
constitutional right to refuse a lawyer's help and represent themselves on
appeal. The right to represent oneself at trial, guaranteed by the
Constitution's Sixth Amendment, does not extend to the appeal process, the
justices said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Cancels Communications Licenses  </HEADLINE>
   By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Valuable communications licenses held by a bankrupt
company have been canceled and will be reauctioned, the government told a
federal appeals court Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Communications Commission, in a filing with the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit Court, objected to plans by NextWave Telecom to
reorganize itself in bankruptcy court in the hopes of using its licenses to
build a wireless network.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, the commission said the licenses had automatically been canceled,
per FCC rules, and that it would seek new bidders for those slices of the
airwaves -- potentially worth billions of dollars -- in July.
</P>
<P>
	   FCC Chairman Bill Kennard, citing a decision from the appeals court that
confirmed the commission's authority over the licenses, said the agency's rules
dictate that such licenses cancel when their holder fails to pay for them on
time.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Allowing a company to keep its licenses despite its failure to pay on time
would be unfair to others who have played by the rules and would undermine the
integrity of our auctions process,'' Kennard said.
</P>
<P>
	   He added that the commission is anxious to put that portion of the airwaves
to use for consumers by auctioning it to another owner.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This spectrum has laid fallow for too long,'' Kennard said.
</P>
<P>
	   The problem of communication companies holding licenses and going bankrupt
has proved a major headache for regulators, who have unsuccessfully sought
legislation to ensure that licenses won at auction are not tied up in bankruptcy
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
	   NextWave, based in Hawthorne, N.Y., won its wireless licenses in a federal
auction several years ago, to use for the next generation of wireless
communications, known as PCS.
</P>
<P>
	   But then the company couldn't raise enough money to pay the $4.7 billion it
had bid for the licenses. The other two top bidders in that auction were also
unable to pay the FCC and filed for Chapter 11, tying up the licenses in
bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
	   A bankruptcy court in New York ruled last year that the company could hold
on to the licenses after paying just a portion of the amount they bid. But the
Second Circuit court in late fall reversed that decision and reaffirmed the
FCC's jurisdiction over the licenses.
</P>
<P>
	   In light of the ruling, the commission filed its petition with the appeals
court stating that the licenses had automatically been canceled and therefore,
any attempts by the company to reorganize itself should not be approved.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, a group of investors including Global Crossing and Liberty
Media, an affiliate of AT&AMP;T, agreed to provide $1.6 billion in cash to help
NextWave emerge from bankruptcy court and build a wireless network.
</P>
<P>
	   That process, however, could take much longer than re-auctioning the
licenses to an existing wireless operator. One potential bidder for the new
licenses is mobile phone company Nextel Communications.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes Tax Break for Poor  </HEADLINE>
   By TERENCE HUNT AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Reassuring himself that he's not a lame duck, President
Clinton began laying out the agenda of his final year in office Wednesday with a
$21 billion expansion in tax credits for the working poor and more help for the
nation's neediest communities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The great challenge for us today is to make up our minds: what are we
going to do with this magic moment of promise,'' Clinton said, boasting about
low unemployment, declining crime rates and the strongest economy in America's
history.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans reacted warily to Clinton's proposal. ``I think the Clinton
administration spends money every day, it seems like,'' Republican presidential
front-runner George W. Bush said. ``If you look at the newspapers, and look at
the programs, there is always another program, another initiative.''
</P>
<P>
	   The president spoke before the Democratic Leadership Council, the centrist
political group he helped found. Introducing Clinton, Sen. Joseph Lieberman,
D-Conn., said the booming economy was ``a great legacy'' for the president.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I always get nervous when people start talking about legacies,'' the
president joked moments later. ``You know, alliteration having the appeal that
it does, it's just one small step from legacy to lame duck.'' But Clinton
hastened to add that he would not be a lame duck until he gave a speech and the
audience was empty.
</P>
<P>
	   Previewing the State of the Union address he will deliver before Congress on
Jan. 27, Clinton said a primary theme would be ``a new opportunity agenda'' of
advancement opportunities for families ``still at the margins of society who are
willing to work and ought to be rewarded for it.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I will put forth my last but still a new agenda, rooted in responsibility,
designed to create a wider, stronger, more inclusive American community and to
create new opportunities.'' He said he would offer education and training
proposals and measures to make health care and child care more affordable.
</P>
<P>
	   The major ingredient of Wednesday's speech was a proposed $21 billion
expansion over 10 years of the earned income tax credit program, which provides
an annual payment for nearly 20 million families living around the national
poverty line. In 1998, the average claim was $1,459 for 19.4 million taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said his initiative would provide up to $1,200 more in tax relief
for eligible families. It would expand the credit for parents with three or more
children, allow married couples to earn an additional $1,450 before the start of
a phase out of their credit, lower the phase out rate and allow families to
contribute to a 401 (k) retirement plan without risking their credit.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, taxpayers earning between $10,000 and $31,000 were eligible,
depending on the number of children they have. Clinton said his program would
increase aid for 6.4 million families.
</P>
<P>
	   On Capitol Hill, Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee, reacted skeptically to the president's proposal. ``Taxpayers
might question spending billions more on a program that the IRS says already
wastes close to $6.5 billion each year -- or about one dollar out of every five
-- because of fraud and mistakes,'' Archer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Beyond expanding the earned income tax credit, Clinton will propose
significant spending increases for programs designed to steer investment to the
nation's neediest urban and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton will seek $5 billion over 10 years for his New Markets tax-credit
program to encourage businesses to invest in neglected communities, said Gene
Sperling, the president's top economic adviser. The program, offering investors
a 25 percent tax credit, had been budgeted at $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the president will expand his empowerment zone tax initiative
by $4 billion over the next 10 years, Sperling said. The program offers tax
relief to attract businesses to economically disadvantaged areas. It also
provides housing redevelopment and enhanced local services.

<HEADLINE> Study: Centralize all police functions  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - The city's troubled police department would get a
centralized command and more high-ranking officers on nights and weekend under a
proposal from City Manager Saundra Kee Borges.
<P>
	   Kee Borges on Wednesday released the independent report and her
recommendations to Mayor Mike Peters and the City Council. The report, prepared
by national police consultant Carroll Buracker &AMP; Associates, was ordered in
October.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the proposal, the department would be headed by a chief, two assistant
chiefs and five deputies who would oversee five bureaus: field services;
investigative services; special operations; professional standards and
operations support.
</P>
<P>
	   Currently, due in part to retirements and attrition, the department has only
one assistant chief and no deputy chiefs. Acting Chief Deborah Barrows said she
would like to see a return to captains supervising each shift.
</P>
<P>
	   Barrows, a 25-year veteran of the troubled force, took the helm when Joseph
F. Croughwell Jr. went on medical leave in June.
</P>
<P>
	   "We can't go on with an acting chief for another six months as we try to
make changes," Peters said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   In November, Peters said publicly that he believed it was time for
Croughwell to retire. Croughwell, who is scheduled for open-heart surgery in a
few days, said at the time that he planned to return to his job once his doctors
gave him approval.
</P>
<P>
	   Buracker also recommended reassessing the police service area model, which
keeps officers in neighborhood stations from responding to calls in other parts
of the city. Kee Borges said she supports the idea of retaining the service
areas as mini-stations while moving all police functions to the Jennings Road
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
	   Recommendations include assigning a deputy chief to work evenings Tuesday
through Saturday and assigning specialized personnel to work Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
	   The report also recommended increasing the number of "community policing"
officers from 13 to 21, while reducing the total size of the department from 482
sworn officers to 424.
</P>
<P>
	   Implementing the proposed changes would require federal grant money as well
as money from the city's general fund, Kee Borges said. But, she said, cutting
back on overtime by establishing a limit for each police division could help
recoup some of the general fund costs.
</P>
<P>
	   The state's largest municipal police force, the Hartford department has been
criticized for repeated incidents of alleged corruption and mismanagement. A
separate consultant's report in October called the $36 million-a-year department
"dysfunctional," saying it has too many officers doing too little work and
making too much in overtime pay.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 20 Hartford police officers have been arrested in on- and off-duty
incidents in the last six years. That includes five officers who were indicted
by a federal grand jury in the spring for allegedly abusing and assaulting
prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
	   The fatal shooting of 14-year-old mugging suspect Aquan Salmon, who was
black, by a white officer also has strained the department's public image. A
prosecutor's report on the shooting is due in a few weeks.

<HEADLINE> Wheat Acreage Hits 28-Year Low  </HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farmers planted less than 43 million acres of winter
wheat last fall, the smallest amount since 1972, as producers trying to cope
with depressed grain prices continue switching to more lucrative crops, the
government said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Plantings of winter wheat are down 1 percent from last season's crop and 8
percent below 1998, according to surveys by the Agriculture Department. About
three-fourths of the wheat produced in the United States is a winter variety,
which is planted in the fall and harvested the following spring.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat plantings started dropping after Congress enacted the 1996 Freedom to
Farm law, which ended production controls and let farmers start switching
between crops without losing subsidies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``With Freedom to Farm we've had the ability to try to go to crops that have
a better potential to be more profitable,'' said Dean Stoskopf, president of the
Kansas Association of Wheat Growers. ``With the wheat prices we have had the
last couple of years, the incentive is to do something different.''
</P>
<P>
	   Farm commodity prices collapsed in 1998 and are expected to rise only slowly
over the next several years because of the heavy production and big surpluses
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
	   Support has been building in Congress and among farm groups to come up with
a new subsidy program that would guarantee farmers a higher income in periods
when prices are low. The nation's largest farm organization, the American Farm
Bureau Federation, in the past has resisted altering the 1996 law, but endorsed
such a proposal Wednesday during its annual convention in Houston.
</P>
<P>
	   Prices for the 1999 wheat crop are averaging between $2.50 to $2.60 a
bushel, down from $2.65 in 1998 and $3.38 in 1997, according to USDA.
</P>
<P>
	   Kansas farmers are growing 9.8 million acres of wheat this winter, down from
10 million last year. Oklahoma's plantings are down to 6.1 million acres from
6.4 million in 1998. In Texas, where dry conditions either delayed or prevented
seeding last fall, the wheat acreage is down to 5.8 million this winter from 6.2
million a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   USDA also issued yearend reports on 1999 crops:
</P>
<P>
	   --The corn harvest reached 9.4 billion bushels, down 3 percent from the year
before but still the fourth largest on record.
</P>
<P>
	   --Soybean production declined 4 percent to 2.6 billion bushels but was still
the third largest ever. Soybean yields were hurt last year because of the
drought in the East and South.
</P>
<P>
	   --Total wheat production last year, including spring varieties, was 2.3
billion bushels, 10 percent less than 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   --The rice crop was a record 21 billion pounds, up 12 percent from 1998. The
cotton crop was up 22 percent last year to 17 million bales.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, USDA slightly raised its estimates of the prices that farmers are
getting for their 1999 crops of wheat, corn and soybeans to reflect
heavier-than-expected demand. The prices of soybeans and wheat were raised 5
cents a bushel, while the projection for corn was up 10 cents.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a fairly modest adjustment from where we would like to see prices
go,'' USDA economist Larry Salathe said.

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS News may have sacrificed journalistic ethics for the
sake of business by superimposing digital images of its logo over that of a
competitor during its newscast, media observers said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   CBS officials said they did nothing wrong when they used digital technology
to layer their name over a large NBC screen and a Budweiser advertisement during
live broadcasts of "CBS Evening News" from Times Square on Dec. 30 and Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   Although digital imaging has been used before to insert advertising on TV
screens during sports and entertainment programs, the leap into news has raised
questions about how it should be used.
</P>
<P>
	   "When there's new technology, the ethical rules have to be restated or
firmed up," said Richard T. Kaplar, vice president of The Media Institute, a
nonprofit think tank in Washington. "This may seem like an innocent little
corporate coup, but there are bigger implications in terms of eroding people's
confidence in what they see on the screen."
</P>
<P>
	   CBS' morning show, "The Early Show," has used the technology routinely since
its Nov. 1 debut to make it seem that a large CBS advertisement is attached to
the General Motors building in New York, where the show originates.
</P>
<P>
	   But CBS News President Andrew Heyward said the decision to use the
technology during the ultra-competitive millennium broadcast did trigger
internal debate, though there was no talk of notifying viewers.
</P>
<P>
	   "Reasonable people could disagree whether it is an appropriate use of
digital technology," Heyward said, "and like any new technology it poses new
issues we have to address on a case-by-case basis."
</P>
<P>
	   Heyward also said CBS has a "core principle" of not deceiving the audience,
and he doesn't believe the imaging violated that principle any more than the
standard use of printed graphics on the television screen.
</P>
<P>
	   CBS spokeswoman Kim Akhtar said Dan Rather knew during the newscast that
digital technology was being used to project the logo behind him, but was not
notified in advance.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC sparked controversy in 1994, when Washington correspondent Cokie Roberts
was introduced as reporting from the Capitol when she was actually standing in
the studio in front of an image of Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a mistake," said Eileen Murphy, spokeswoman for ABC News. "It should
never have happened and you won't see that happening again."
</P>
<P>
	   Although ABC uses digital imaging for Monday Night Football and other
sportscasts, Murphy said viewer credibility is too important to try it with the
news. In a 1998 Gallup poll, 66 percent of respondents said they trust nightly
network news and CNN, a number topped only by local TV news.
</P>
<P>
	   "You have an obligation to your viewers in news programming to be truthful,
and we just see it as being a bit manipulative," Murphy said. "It could have the
potential to raise questions in viewer's minds."
</P>
<P>
	   Aly Colon of The Poynter Institute for Media Studies in St. Petersburg, Fla.
agreed.
</P>
<P>
	   "If what's behind (Dan Rather) is not accurate or real, then is what he is
saying or where he is or what he's trying to convey any more authentic than the
environment he's in?" Colon asked.
</P>
<P>
	   NBC said it has never used digital imaging during its nightly newscasts and
has no plans to do so.
</P>
<P>
	   Digital manipulation is not limited to television. Time magazine apologized
to readers in 1994 for featuring a darkened version of O.J. Simpson's mug shot
on its cover. And many newspapers have policies against the use of
digitally-enhanced photos.
</P>
<P>
	   But with technology accelerating, Colon said, the famous wall between the
journalistic and the business sides of the news may need shoring up.
</P>
<P>
	   "You have to think about why those walls are there and if you're going to
vault over them, what that implies," Colon said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think that it's going to be a very challenging element that the news
industry will have to address in terms of who's going to be responsible for the
news."

<HEADLINE> Korea Auto Cos. Show Off New Models  </HEADLINE>
    By JOSEPH ALTMAN Jr. Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- Three Korean automakers that found good times in the U.S.
market last year showed off their expansion plans during previews Wednesday for
the North American International Auto Show.
</P>
<P>
	   Hyundai, Kia and Daewoo all exhibited models going on sale in 2000, most of
which expand their lineups from the small cars that sold well in 1999 to midsize
sedans and sport utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
	   Hyundai announced it will sell a full-size passenger car, currently dubbed
the XG, in the United States this fall. The four-door, five-passenger sedan is
aimed at older buyers who make more than $60,000 per year -- a step above the
automaker's typical base of customers who are looking for value-priced, compact
cars.
</P>
<P>
	   "With the success of the Sonata, we feel there is now a place in our model
lineup for a slightly larger vehicle," said Robert Cosmai, Hyundai's vice
president for sales.
</P>
<P>
	   The XG, whose name may change before it is released, will offer a 3.0-liter
V6 with 192 horsepower, and will be priced between $23,000 and $24,000, Cosmai
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hyundai also showed off its previously introduced Santa Fe SUV, the first in
the South Korean carmaker's line. It is set to go on sale this summer at a price
between $17,000 and $21,000, Cosmai said.
</P>
<P>
	   Daewoo, attending Detroit's annual show for the first time since entering
the U.S. market 15 months ago, unveiled the first SUV in its lineup -- the 2001
Korando. The two-door Korando, poised to compete with the Jeep Cherokee and
Toyota RAV4, will have a 3.2-liter, six-cylinder engine from Mercedes that
produces 217 horsepower. Daewoo plans to sell it for about $20,000, starting in
May.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're finally joining the sport-utility segment of the market, and I don't
have to tell you that's an important segment to be a part of," said William D.
Tucker, vice president of marketing for the automaker. "It's not breaking ground
in SUVs, but it will compete with others in its segment."
</P>
<P>
	   Daewoo also announced an update for the Leganza sedan, which will sell for
between $13,000 and $18,66, and a larger sedan model called the Magnus.
</P>
<P>
	   Kia revealed its 2000 Spectra hatchback sedan, which will be in dealerships
this spring for a price only slightly higher than the Sephia sedan's $9,995
price, said Dick Macedo, executive vice president for marketing and sales.
</P>
<P>
	   Kia also has plans to introduce a mid-size sedan in the fall, allowing the
Korean automaker to expand into what Macedo called "a very competitive sector."
</P>
<P>
	   Other news from the show Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
	   --The president of Toyota Motor Co. urged automakers to work together to
speed development of cars that pollute less.
</P>
<P>
	   "We can no longer afford to ignore the signs of global warming and the fact
that consumption of gasoline and other fossil fuels is on the rise," said Toyota
President Fujio Cho. "Environmentally friendly cars will soon cease to be an
option -- they will become a necessity."
</P>
<P>
	   --Honda said it would expand the hybrid engine technology it uses in its
Insight hatchback to other models in several years. The Insight pairs a
three-cylinder gas engine with an electric motor and battery pack to deliver gas
mileage of up to 70 mpg.
</P>
<P>
	   The company also said it would launch a series of cleaner gas engines this
year, and recommitted to building a car powered by fuel cells in 2003.

<HEADLINE> Court Mulls Grandparents' Rights  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- While acknowledging a ``special relationship'' between
grandparents and grandchildren, Supreme Court justices appeared troubled by
state laws that give grandparents broad rights to seek court-ordered visitation
against parents' wishes.
</P>
<P>
	   In an intense debate over an emotionally charged issue, the nation's highest
court on Wednesday assessed two competing values -- a state's desire to promote
children's best interests and parents' right to raise their children free from
government interference.
</P>
<P>
	   The way the justices resolve that conflict, in a decision expected by late
June, could touch every corner of America. Sixty million Americans are
grandparents. So are six of the court's nine members.
</P>
<P>
	   A majority of the justices voiced grave concerns about a Washington state
law that allowed ``any person,'' relative or nonrelative, to win a court-ordered
right to see a child any time such visitation was found to be in a child's best
interest.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Breathtakingly broad,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor called it before
asking one lawyer, ``Do you defend it ... any person, any time?''
</P>
<P>
	   Early in the hourlong session of arguments, Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist asked whether the law might allow a little girl's ``great aunt'' to
``come in and say, 'I want to take her to the movies every Friday.'''
</P>
<P>
	   And Justice Stephen G. Breyer indicated he was not about to favor a law that
would grant visitation rights to ``an accordion player who wants to visit once a
year,'' even if music lessons were in a child's best interest.
</P>
<P>
	   The state law also came under spirited questioning from Justices Antonin
Scalia and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
	   But Breyer also asked about the ``special'' nature of a case involving
grandparents seeking more time with their grandchildren. And Justice David H.
Souter, otherwise hostile to Washington's law, discussed the ``special
relationship'' a grandparent might have with a grandchild.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice John Paul Stevens, at 79 the court's oldest member, asked several
questions focusing on a parent's asserted ``absolute veto'' power over how often
grandparents can see their grandchildren. ``Is there no relief for a
grandparent?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
	   While all 50 states have laws allowing grandparents and others to seek
visitation after divorces or under other circumstances, only a handful of those
laws go as far as Washington's. The state's Supreme Court struck down the law in
late 1998, ruling it violated parents' rights.
</P>
<P>
	   That decision wiped out an Anacortes, Wash., couple's legal right to see
their two granddaughters.
</P>
<P>
	   Gary and Jennifer Troxel, who sat through the court proceeding, seek to
regain the right to see the two girls, 10-year-old Natalie and 8-year-old
Isabelle, more often than their mother, Tommie Granville Wynn, is willing to let
them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The court should balance all the interests,'' Seattle lawyer Mark Olson
argued for the Troxels, emphasizing the importance of letting children ``know
where they come from.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Seattle lawyer Catherine Smith, representing the girls' mother, said the
visitation order the Troxels obtained from a state court violated her client's
``right to make these decisions absent a showing that the children were being
harmed.''
</P>
<P>
	   The ``pernicious effect'' of Washington's invalidated law, Smith said, is a
parent being forced to defend ``a perfectly reasonable decision.... No one
should be brought into court for that kind of suit.''
</P>
<P>
	   The girls' father, Brad Troxel, committed suicide in 1993. He and Tommie
Granville were never married but had two daughters during their relationship.
When they separated, Troxel lived with his parents. The girls regularly visited
their father at the Troxels' home.
</P>
<P>
	   After the suicide, Natalie and Isabelle continued seeing their grandparents
regularly until their mother limited their visits.
</P>
<P>
	   The Troxels went into state court, and two years later were awarded
visitation of one weekend a month, one week during the summer and certain other
days.
</P>
<P>
	   While Granville appealed, she married Kelly Wynn. He then adopted the girls.
</P>
<P>
	   Rehnquist, Stevens, O'Connor, Scalia, Ginsburg and Justice Anthony M.
Kennedy are the court's grandparents. Justice Clarence Thomas was raised by his
grandparents.
</P>
<P>
	   A survey released last week by AARP found about one in nine American
grandparents over the age of 50 helps care for at least one grandchild. The
survey showed that 8 percent provide day care regularly, and 3 percent function
as parents, rearing a grandchild.

<HEADLINE> Big Movers in the Stock Market  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks that moved substantially or traded heavily today on
the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
	   The financially troubled drug store company said Tuesday it will delay
filing any further quarterly financial statements until July 11 and pushed back
the date for the sale of its PCS Health Systems unit. Today, Lehman Brothers
said the New York Stock Exchange may delist the stock, but exchange officials
later said they had made no decision to do so.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong expects to report fourth-quarter earnings of 90 cents to 95 cents
a share, below analysts' consensus estimate of $1.21 a share. Armstrong cited
weakness in European sales and rising lumber prices in its hardwood flooring
division.
</P>
<P>
	   Merrill Lynch raised its rating on Avista stock to "buy" from "accumulate,"
labeling the small-cap utility company "2000's hidden gem." Merrill cited the
perceived potential in three of Avista's units, including an Internet-based
utility aggregation business.
</P>
<P>
	   Roche Holdings AG, which owns a majority stake in Genentech, has renewed
plans to raise $1 billion by selling bonds that are exchangeable into Genentech
stock. Genentech said it expects about 2.5 percent of its stock to be involved
in the deal.
</P>
<P>
	   The company earned 19 cents per share in the fourth quarter, easily beating
analysts' estimates of 15 cents per share. Yahoo! also announced a 2-for-1 stock
split. But company officials warned investors that Yahoo!'s revenue growth is
not sustainable.
</P>
<P>
	   The sneaker maker expects to report fourth-quarter earnings in the range of
40 cents to 50 cents per share. Analysts had anticipated earnings of 55 cents
per share. KSwiss said several footwear and sporting goods retailers delayed
orders during the quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said its results for the quarter ended Dec. 31 are likely to
fall below analysts' expectations due in part to concerns about the Year 2000
computer bug. Santa Cruz said many customers delayed purchases of its server
operating systems and network computing software.
</P>
<P>
	   The company has entered discussions with Red Hat Inc. to sell Red Hat's
Linux operating system to the federal government. Government Technology said it
plans to add Linux products and services to at least two of its government-wide
acquisition contracts.

<HEADLINE> White House Unveils Education Money  </HEADLINE>
   By JANELLE CARTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration will propose $367 million to
create smaller and safer schools around the country, Vice President Al Gore said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The funding request, part of the fiscal 2001 budget President Clinton will
submit to Congress, will include $247 million for the Safe Schools/Healthy
Students Initiative, which awards grants to help develop community-wide
responses to school and youth violence.
</P>
<P>
	   The president also will propose spending $120 million for the Small, Safe
and Successful High Schools Initiative, which encourages school districts to
create smaller schools.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the aftermath of tragic violence in our schools, there can be no doubt
that this investment in our children's safety is essential,'' Gore said. The
goal, he said, is to offer ``young people the safe and healthy environments they
need to thrive.''
</P>
<P>
	   As for smaller schools, Gore said it would mean ``more personal attention to
the varied needs of all our children.''
</P>
<P>
	   In September, Clinton announced over $100 million in Safe Schools/Healthy
Students grants for 54 school districts. The amount being proposed in the new
budget is an increase of more than $100 million and will allow grants for 40
more communities.
</P>
<P>
	   The second program allows schools to break up larger schools using
innovative strategies such as autonomous schools-within-schools, restructured
school days and career academies.
</P>
<P>
	   The program is structured around research that has shown that smaller
schools are safer and more productive because students feel less alienated, more
nurtured and more connected to caring adults.
</P>
<P>
	   There are more than 12,400 three- and four-year high schools in the United
States. More than 70 percent of students in those schools attend a school with
more than 1,000 students. Enrollments of 2,000 and 3,000 are not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
	   The program started last year with $45 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Mary Elizabeth Teasley, government relations director for the National
Education Association, said it is partnerships like the ones being proposed that
help school districts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The resources will make a significant difference both in funding these
programs and in highlighting these issues. ... It's an encouragement for
districts that are lagging behind.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up Despite Bond Market Slump  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against most major currencies on Wednesday,
despite a steep slump in the U.S. bond market.
</P>
<P>
	   In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0311, down from $1.0322.
The dollar was quoted at 105.98 Japanese yen, down slightly from 105.99 yen late
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Traders in foreign-exchange markets are watching their moves this month amid
concerns that the Federal Reserve may boost rates at its meeting in February.
</P>
<P>
	   Fears over a rate hike sent bond prices falling Wednesday and the yield on
the 30-year Treasury bond rising to 6.71 percent, the highest level since July
1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Currency traders worry that a slump in stock and bond markets could dampen
demand for dollars as people look elsewhere around the world to invest their
money.
</P>
<P>
	   "Many people think that the Fed will take on a more aggressive rate position
and that's spooking a lot of investors," said Ricardo Gomes, head of foreign
exchange at HSBC USA.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar also was quoted at 1.5627 Swiss francs, up from 1.5603, and
1.4541 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4567. The British pound was quoted at
$1.6477, unchanged from late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no longer
traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. Based on Wednesday's
euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8969 German marks, up from 1.8948; 6.3614
French francs, up from 6.3549; and 1,877.78 Italian lire, up from 1,875.87.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton campaign asks for soft-money summit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign manager invited
his counterpart on Rudolph Giuliani's political team on Wednesday to negotiate a
mutual ban on the use of unlimited soft-money contributions in their expected
Senate race.
<P>
	   But Giuliani campaign chief Bruce Teitelbaum, in a subsequent letter to
Clinton campaign manager Bill de Blasio, said that before any such negotiations
could take place, the first lady would have to refund such money already spent
on her behalf.
</P>
<P>
	   "You should also determine how much soft money you have already raised and
publicly declare that none of that money will be used to benefit the Clinton
campaign in any way," the aide to the Republican mayor of New York City wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   Trading letters, de Blasio criticized Giuliani's fund-raising activities and
said "we are disappointed that you are apparently rejecting our offer to meet."
</P>
<P>
	   Thus far, the national Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has raised
several hundred thousand dollars in unlimited soft-money donations aimed at
helping Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaign in New York. And, it spent more than
$200,000 to finance television ads across upstate New York late last year
promoting the first lady.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, chairman of the DSCC, said
the committee was prepared to spend "whatever is required to win" New York's
Senate race.
</P>
<P>
	   Under fire for her use of soft money, Mrs. Clinton began pressing Giuliani
at the end of last year to agree to a ban on the use of such funding and to
disavow third-party advocacy advertising in their race. The Giuliani camp
demanded the proposal in writing before entering into such talks.
</P>
<P>
	   Howard Wolfson, spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's campaign team, said Wednesday
that de Blasio had telephoned Teitelbaum Tuesday to discuss the issue, was
unable to get through and left a message. Teitelbaum returned the call
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Bruce said he would talk with his boss and get back to us," Wolfson
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Teitelbaum did so in his letter to de Blasio, and made it public.
</P>
<P>
	   "I agree this is a good opportunity to discuss the role that soft money will
play in the upcoming Senate race," the Giuliani aide wrote. "We must, however,
start the discussion on a level playing field."
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to demanding that Mrs. Clinton pay the cost of the DSCC-financed
TV ads out of her campaign account, Teitelbaum said "it would also be useful if
we could agree on an ironclad, verifiable method of accountability to ensure
that any agreement we reach will be honored throughout the campaign."
</P>
<P>
	   "Because of the soft money you have already raised, and the massive
fund-raising apparatus at your disposal, the issues of verification and trust
are of paramount concern to us," the Giuliani aide added.
</P>
<P>
	   Verification and trust was a concept promoted by President Reagan in his
dealings with the Soviets over arms control.
</P>
<P>
	   While Giuliani has not been actively raising soft money for the Senate race,
he has not ruled out using such funds.
</P>
<P>
	   And de Blasio in his letter to Teitelbaum noted that third-party attack ads
aimed at Hillary Clinton have already appeared in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Under federal rules, Senate candidates can accept no more than $2,000 from
individual contributors to spend on their races. But those same contributors can
give unlimited money to political committees such as the DSCC that can then use
it to promote a candidate, as long as they don't directly ask you to vote for
that candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton appeared with the Rev. Jesse Jackson and U.S.
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers at a conference sponsored by Jackson's "Wall
Street Project."
</P>
<P>
	   At the event, the first lady proposed expanding micro-credit, small loans to
would-be entrepreneurs, and providing more small-business services to upstate
areas.

	   Yahoo! Leads Internet Stock Fall
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Yahoo! led a decline today in Internet stocks.
Shares of the search engine fell steeply a day after the company
posted a better-than-expected profit report. Yahoo! said late
yesterday it earned 19 cents per share in the fourth quarter, above
Wall Street's prediction of 15 cents per share. But company
officials also warned in a conference call that Yahoo!'s strong
revenue growth is not sustainable. America Online fell as investors
continued to fret about the company's growth potential once it
merges with Time Warner. Microsoft also fell. Just before the close
of Wall Street's regular session, The Associated Press reported
that government lawyers involved in Microsoft's antitrust case want
the company to break itself into three parts to dilute its
competitive advantage. Yahoo! was down 39 13/16 at 357 9/16. AOL
lost 3 13/16 to 60 3/16. Microsoft was down 3 9/16 at 105 13/16.

Aid. But later, NYSE said it would not delist ``at this time,''
though it was closely monitoring the situation. The nation's
third-largest pharmacy chain announced late yesterday that it had
reached agreement with its lenders on the delay and planned to seek

	   Ford Phases In Side Air-Bag System
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. is phasing in side air-bag
curtains on sport utility vehicles that are designed to cover the
windows to prevent the ejection of passengers in rollover crashes.
The new system, made public today at the Detroit auto show, will be
phased in on SUVs within three years starting with some 2001 models
as optional equipment, Ford officials said. In designing the
system, Ford is responding to highway crash data that show pickups
and sport utility vehicles, which have a higher center of gravity,
roll over more than cars. Forty-seven percent of all fatalities in
light trucks -- which include SUVs -- result from rollover, according
to the National Highway Traffic Safety

	   Japan's Economy Embraces Change
</P>
<P>
	   TOKYO (AP) -- In many ways, 1999 was truly the end of an era for
Japan -- and after a decadelong economic downturn, many economists
wouldn't have it any other way. But the question now facing the
world's second-richest nation is whether it can keep up the
momentum. Analysts say this year that the economy will finally
return to growth thanks to generous public spending, a recovery in
the stock market, and a bottoming-out of corporate bankruptcies.
But the question is whether dynamic change will give birth to
self-sustained expansion or a return to inertia leads to steady
decline.

<HEADLINE> Ford Offers SUV Rollover Air Bags  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN HYDE AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. will offer a new safety option in its sport
utility vehicles -- air bags that cover the side windows like curtains to
prevent passengers from being thrown out in rollover crashes.
</P>
<P>
	   The new ai-rbag curtains are Ford's answer to figures showing passengers in
SUVs are four times more likely to be involved in a rollover during a serious
accident than passengers in cars. Most often, rollover deaths involve passengers
being thrown from the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
	   The curtains, unveiled Wednesday during the preview of the North American
International Auto Show, will be phased in on Ford's SUVs.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford said an unspecified model will get the curtains as an option late this
year, and the devices should be available as optional equipment on all of the
automaker's SUVs in about three years.
</P>
<P>
	   No price has been set. Nor would Ford executives talk about putting the
system in pickups, minivans or cars.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 47 percent
of all deaths in light trucks -- which include SUVs -- result from rollovers. In
comparison, 22 percent of car deaths involve rollovers.
</P>
<P>
	   The system has a sensor that can measure the amount of vehicle tilt and
trigger the air-bag curtain. The curtain would deploy downward in milliseconds
from the edge of the roof, covering the side windows along the front and back
rows of seats.
</P>
<P>
	   The curtains, attached to the vehicle with tethers, remain inflated for six
seconds, the amount of time Ford says it takes the average vehicle to roll over
up to three times. The sensor will modulate the force of the airbags depending
on the speed of the vehicle, inflating the curtains faster at higher speeds.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford said the curtains are also intended to reduce head injuries in
side-impact crashes.
</P>
<P>
	   Several automakers, including Mercedes and Volvo, also have air bag curtains
that inflate across the windows. BMW has an air bag that inflates in the shape
of a tube that hangs near the top of the window.
</P>
<P>
	   Those systems are primarily advertised as a means of protecting people's
heads, though the automakers say they could help keep passengers from being
thrown out in a rollover.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ford system is designed specifically for rollover protection.
</P>
<P>
	   Many automakers, including Ford, already have side air-bag systems that
deploy from the seat or door and are designed to protect the head or chest in
side-impact crashes.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford's announcement came as the NHTSA develops a vehicle rollover rating
system expected to be proposed in the next few months. Last year, the agency
started requiring most new SUVs to carry illustrated warning labels declaring
they have a "higher rollover risk" than standard automobiles.

<HEADLINE> Americans Ignorant of Their Implants  </HEADLINE>
    By LAURAN NEERGAARD AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Up to 25 million Americans are living with implanted
medical devices, from pacemakers to artificial joints, but too many patients
have unrealistic expectations of how long implants will last and don't even know
what model is in their bodies, a scientific panel said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, scientists are hampered in efforts to create better medical implants
because too few of the devices are removed from patients' bodies -- when they
die or need a replacement -- to study which lasted longest, worked best and was
safest, said experts convened by the National Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
	   One big reason: Fear of lawsuits if scientists point out a flaw to correct.
</P>
<P>
	   But that lack of research means doctors today have few ways to compare
different implants and choose the best model -- and in turn are providing their
patients with too little information, leading to unrealistic expectations, the
panel said.
</P>
<P>
	   Even the panel's co-chair ran into the problem when she had hip replacement
surgery last August.
</P>
<P>
	   The surgeon held up her X-rays, "and said, 'Two new hips.' That's all I was
going to learn about it if I had not come with all sorts of questions," said
Northwestern University engineer Julia Weertman.
</P>
<P>
	   So the panel called on the government Wednesday to fund better education of
patients and doctors, including establishing an Internet site with the latest
information comparing different implants' risks and benefits. The idea is if a
patient needed, say, a new hip, he or she would have a source of reliable
information on what is state-of-the-art and how long to expect the joint to last
given the patient's age and other factors.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, doctors should more thoroughly inform patients before surgery of the
short- and long-term risks of their implant, the panel stressed.
</P>
<P>
	   Perhaps of most immediate importance, the panel also recommended each
implant recipient be given a card to keep that lists the make, model and serial
number of their implant -- important in case of a recall or questions about a
device's safety, but information most patients today never get.
</P>
<P>
	   Such steps also could persuade patients of the need to let scientists
retrieve and study their implants upon their death or, in the worst-case
scenario, a device failure.
</P>
<P>
	   Actually, most medical implants work well, the panel stressed -- many last
years, even decades.
</P>
<P>
	   But patients "never seem to think a mechanical (medical) device is ever
going to wear out, even though ... they have enough experience with their
automobiles," Weertman said. "We are trying to educate the consumer so he will
realize things don't last forever, and there is a need to improve these
devices."
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the NIH panel acknowledged it faced complex hurdles. The panel
declined to recommend a national database to track implant patients, as some
other countries do, because of confidentiality concerns and cost. Nor could the
panel estimate how much consumer education and the hoped-for Web site would
cost, or even who would ensure patients received those implant information
cards.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, some manufacturers do manage to retrieve and study certain implants,
but typically consider their findings a trade secret, so doctors don't learn of
product concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would like to draw attention to what I believe is a code of silence I
believe is imposed ... by the threat of litigation," complained panel member
Arthur Kantrowitz, a Dartmouth College engineer.
</P>
<P>
	   The panel, however, urged NIH to hold another meeting of legal experts hunt
a solution.
</P>
<P>
	   But some manufacturers do publish their studies of retrieved implants, and
would provide information if the government starts an implant Web site, said Jim
Benson of the Health Industry Manufacturers Association.

<HEADLINE> Racial discrimination lawsuit filed against city police  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Police hunting for drug dealers turned a black actor's
professional performace into his real-life horror when they falsely arrested
him, according to a lawsuit filed Wednesday.
<P>
	   The civil rights action by Alton Fitzgerald White seeks unspecified damages
for violations of his constitutional rights to be free of false arrest, illegal
imprisonment and racial discrimination, according to the suit.
</P>
<P>
	   White, 35, who has the lead in the current Broadway production of "Ragtime,"
continues to suffer severe emotional distress and damage to his reputation,
according to the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's haunting him. As his manager, I see it every day. It was a real blow,"
said Renee Harriston.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit filed on his behalf by the New York Civil Liberties Union noted
that White's experience was not uncommon for black men. It cited a Dec. 1 state
attorney general report finding blacks are significantly more likely to be
stopped and arrested without legal justification than whites.
</P>
<P>
	   White's lawsuit stems from a July 16 encounter with police who came to his
Harlem apartment building in search of drug dealers. Instead, they found the
actor and three other black men and arrested them along with two Hispanic men.
</P>
<P>
	   The other three black men - Ronald C. Jackson, Christopher Montgomery and
Marcus McCollum - filed a separate federal lawsuit Wednesday seeking $2.22
million in damages. Jackson is the student activities coordinator at Columbia
University while Montgomery is a graduate student at Columbia and McCollum is a
clothing merchandiser for designer Donna Karan. All three were in White's
building helping a friend move.
</P>
<P>
	   "They didn't have any reason to stop me - it was because I am black," White
said in an interview with The Associated Press shortly after his arrest. "They
searched my bag and didn't find what they were looking for. There were so many
opportunities for them to let me go but they didn't."
</P>
<P>
	   But in a statement Wednesday, New York Police Department Deputy Commissioner
for Legal Matters George Grasso called the arrests "a clear-cut example of
police officers putting their lives on the line and acting well within the scope
of their duties to protect the lives of Mr. White and his neighbors. It is,
indeed, a shame that Mr. White refuses to understand this concept."
</P>
<P>
	   White has said his run-in with police has strengthened his performance as
Coalhouse Walker, the musician he plays in "Ragtime." In the musical set in
1906, Walker is harassed by white firemen as he drives through a small New York
town.
</P>
<P>
	   But the incident also left White deeply affected - he stayed in his
apartment for five days and missed five performances before he felt he had to
come to terms with the arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   "'Ragtime' is a very intense show - what my character has to go through and
what he has to say," White said. "As an actor that is a challenge, but as a
black man it's very upsetting. And that all occurs in 1906. We're in 1999 - what
happened to me is like an updated version of that."
</P>
<P>
	   White said he found it humiliating to be put "in a jail cell, strip searched
and then questioned three times."
</P>
<P>
	   At one point, realizing he would not make that night's performance, White
began weeping and repeatedly told the police he was innocent.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is standard procedure," was the answer cops gave him, White said.
</P>
<P>
	   Five hours later, White and his three black acquaintances were released.
Only the two Hispanic men - whom White contends he did not know - were charged
in connection with the drug sweep.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview last year, "Ragtime" author E.L. Doctorow said he was
saddened by White's arrest but was not surprised.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everytime a non-white person steps out of his door today he can expect his
humanity to be challenged," Doctorow said. "There's a deep fault line in
America's society, a fault line that runs through America's heart."
</P>
<P>
	   "These days the structural racism in this country finds its worst expression
in the culture of big city police departments - it seems to be the preferred
style in police work to violate rights and to debase people," said Doctorow, who
sent White a note expressing his sympathies.
</P>
<P>
	   "It didn't require any gift of prophesy on my part, in telling the story of
Coalhouse in epic terms," Doctorow said about his novel published in 1975. "In
writing about America 100 years ago, you are sadly talking about times today."

<HEADLINE> Sugar at 8-Month Low; Grains Soar  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   The U.S. government's unexpected slashing of its estimate for the nation's
corn harvest sent prices rocketing higher Wednesday on the Chicago Board of
Trade, generating hopes the market's lengthy slump may be ending.
</P>
<P>
	   Other grain futures and soybeans joined in the rally.
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere in commodity trading, crude oil prices forged an additional 2
percent higher and sugar sank to an eight-month low.
</P>
<P>
	   Corn prices rose 4 percent for the day, leaving the $2-a-bushel level far
behind and approaching the numbers of a year ago, after the Department of
Agriculture report was issued. Corn for March delivery rose 8 1/4 cents to $2.15
1/2 a bushel.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've ratcheted ourselves into a new trading level," said Dale Gustafson,
an analyst for Salomon Smith Barney, reflecting an upbeat mood in the business
after months of languishing prices for not only corn but other agricultural
commodities.
</P>
<P>
	   At a time of year when crop estimates usually grow, the USDA lowered the
size of the estimated U.S. 1999 harvest by 100 million bushels to 9.4 billion
bushels. The total represents a 3 percent decline from the previous year but
still the fourth-largest on record.
</P>
<P>
	   Corn stocks were assessed at lower than expected, thanks to record usage of
corn as a livestock feed grain for the quarter. That's good news in a market
clouded by too much world supply.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a pretty positive report for everything," said Dean Nosker, an
analyst for A.G. Edwards &AMP; Co. in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
	   "The only problem, and it's a big one, is we've got a lot of corn and
soybeans yet in farmers' hands," he said. "Those supplies are still hanging over
the market a bit. But today's report gave us a nudge in the right direction."
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat prices also were buoyed by USDA figures showing that American farmers
have planted the smallest acreage in wheat this winter since 1972 -- 8 percent
less than in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Soybeans benefited from a cut, too -- the USDA said U.S. production declined
4 percent to 2.6 billion bushels, although it was still the third-biggest ever.
</P>
<P>
	   But market experts are not ready to proclaim a bull market for commodities
just yet.
</P>
<P>
	   "Before we can have a sustained bull market, we're going to have some
production problems resulting from bad weather either in the United States or in

<HEADLINE> Jail guards plead guilty to fatal beating of Nassau Jail inmate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) - Two Nassau County corrections officers pleaded
guilty Wednesday to federal civil rights charges for fatally beating a
recovering heroin addict in his cell at the county jail.
<P>
	   The guards, Patrick Regnier and Edward Velazquez, changed their pleas to
guilty before U.S. District Court Judge Jacob Mishler. They opted to plead after
a third guard cut a deal last week, admitting that he served as the lookout on
Jan. 8, 1999. He also agreed to testify against his co-workers.
</P>
<P>
	   Velazquez, under questioning from the judge, admitted that he went to Thomas
Pizzuto's cell "to quiet him down and use unreasonable force if necessary." When
prodded by the judge, Regnier admitted: "I did land on him with my knees. I did
punch him in the back."
</P>
<P>
	   The prisoner was crying out for his methadone treatment. Pizzuto, 38, of
Hicksville, was serving a 90-day sentence for traffic violations.
</P>
<P>
	   Three days after the beating, he suffered a seizure and died. The Nassau
County medical examiner found that Pizzuto had suffered a ruptured spleen and
ruled the death a homicide.
</P>
<P>
	   The courtroom was packed Wednesday, with Pizzuto's mother, widow and
wheelchair-bound father weeping quietly during the 70-minute session. Outside,
dozens of corrections officers stood quietly in support of their colleagues.
</P>
<P>
	   "I cried," Carol Pizzuto said at the sight of the supporters. "I walked up
here today and I cried, because I couldn't believe this is the world that we
live in. That these people are backing up murderers ... to my face. How could
they do that?"
</P>
<P>
	   None of the corrections officers wanted to speak with reporters outside the
courthouse.
</P>
<P>
	   The amount of prison time the accused pair faces at their April 7 sentencing
will be determined by Mishler after a hearing on whether Pizzuto's death
amounted to murder or manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
	   A ruling that the death was the result of murder could bring each guard up
to life in prison, while a manslaughter ruling would yield a sentence of between
3 1/2 and 12 1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Pizzuto said she hopes they receive the maximum.
</P>
<P>
	   "They pled for mercy, they showed my son no mercy," Mrs. Pizzuto said
outside the courthouse, tears streaming down her face.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense case suffered a major setback last week when a third guard
charged in the case, Ivano Bavaro, pleaded guilty to federal conspiracy and
witness tampering charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Bavaro admitted that he acted as a lookout while Velazquez and Regnier went
into Pizzuto's cell and pounded the inmate into silence.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial against a fourth guard, Joseph Bergen, accused of filing a false
report indicating that Pizzuto had slipped in the shower, is scheduled to start
next week.
</P>
<P>
	   The East Meadow jail, which houses about 1,800 inmates and is patrolled by
approximately 1,100 guards, has been the subject of numerous allegations of
guard misconduct. Following Pizzuto's death and other allegations of abuse, the
U.S. Department of Justice began an investigation of how inmates there are
treated.
</P>
<P>
	   Last March, a Nassau County correction officer was found liable in the
beating of a mentally retarded jail inmate with a frying pan in 1993. County
officials agreed to a $500,000 settlement in the inmate's civil rights lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   "The bottom line here is they all plead guilty, really, to causing Thomas
Pizzuto's death and vindicated everything that this family has said about how it
happened," said attorney Barry Scheck, who represents the family in a civil
lawsuit against the jail.
</P>
<P>
	   "The truth of the matter is that this has been going on for a long time in
the Nassau County Jail and everybody knows it," said Scheck. "There have been
civil suits that have been successfully brought against these guards and yet
nothing is done about it. And there's a code of silence and this code of silence
has to be broken."
</P>
<P>
	   Sheriff Joseph Jablonsky, whose jurisdiction included the jail, retired late
last year. A replacement has yet to be hired.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokeswoman for County Executive Thomas Gulotta had no comment.

<HEADLINE> Bradley defends letter on behalf of New Jersey company  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Bill Bradley on Wednesday dismissed as "not a big
deal" a letter he wrote in 1994 on behalf of a New Jersey company whose officers
had donated money to his Senate campaign account.
<P>
	   Bradley, who represented New Jersey for three terms, said he didn't think it
was "wrong at all" to urge the Commerce Department to give "fair treatment" to
Sigma Corp. of Cream Ridge, N.J.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's president, Victor Pais, said Bradley "did nothing other than
just write a routine letter" that had nothing to do with political donations
made 15 months earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   But the existence of the letter, first reported in Wednesday's Boston Globe,
put Bradley on the defensive hours before he was to detail his criticisms of the
campaign finance system in general.
</P>
<P>
	   Although all candidates were invited, Bradley was the only presidential
candidate expected to attend an evening campaign finance forum in Manchester,
N.H., co-sponsored by Common Cause, which supports overhauling federal campaign
finance laws.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley had invited scrutiny of his Senate letter-writing record days
earlier, after questions were raised about letters written by Republican
presidential candidate Sen. John McCain on behalf of a major contributor.
Bradley said at the time that his policy during his 18 years in the Senate was
not to "intervene in regulatory matters."
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about the Sigma letter in Iowa on Wednesday, Bradley maintained that
writing letters to regulators "wasn't a practice" and that the discovery of one
or two such letters does not undermine his general policy.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think it's wrong at all," he said about the 1994 letter. "What am I
going to say to a New Jersey company - 'No, I'm not going to write on your
behalf and ask for a decision to be made'?"
</P>
<P>
	   His spokeswoman, Kristen Ludecke added, "This is communicating on behalf of
a constituent and helping them navigate the bureaucracy."
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Al Gore declined to comment on the letter sent by his
opponent for the Democratic presidential nomination. Asked whether he wrote
similar ones as a senator from Tennessee, Gore said: "I've never claimed not to
have helped my constituents and my state and my congressional district."
</P>
<P>
	   Sigma, which manufactures industrial pipe fittings, appealed a 1992 decision
by the International Trade Commission to impose a 127 percent duty on exports to
the United States by China National Metal Products. Sigma, which imports and
distributes water pipe fittings made by the Chinese company, protested the duty.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Court of International Trade returned the case to the Commerce
Department in June 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   Days later, Bradley wrote to then-Commerce Secretary Ron Brown: "Sigma has
now been denied access to its CDIW fittings, a critical part of its product
line, for over two years. It only seems right that your department do its best
to ensure that this case not drag out any longer than necessary."
</P>
<P>
	   In 1993, company president Pais and vice president Mark each had donated
$500 to Bradley's Senate campaign account.
</P>
<P>
	   Pais said Wednesday that Abrams was interested in politics and that both men
made campaign contributions, "from time to time, not anything extensive." He
said the donations had nothing to do with the company's decision to seek
Bradley's help.
</P>
<P>
	   Pais said Sigma sought a meeting with Bradley in 1994, but had to settle for
a letter after Bradley's staff said the senator was too busy.
</P>
<P>
	   Pais said Bradley's letter had no effect on the case, which the company
ultimately won in court.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Puts Ocalan Hanging On Hold  </HEADLINE>
   By SUZAN FRASER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Turkey's government on Wednesday put on hold the
execution of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, a move aimed at enhancing the
country's prospects for joining the European Union.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision, which came after coalition leaders met for eight hours, came
in response to a request from the European Court of Human Rights to review
Ocalan's appeal. The rebel leader was sentenced to death in June by a Turkish
court.
</P>
<P>
	   Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema expressed ``great satisfaction'' with
Turkey's decision, saying ``the choice confirms the evolution of Turkish
politics towards Europe and its democratic principles.'' A Rome city official
said the colosseum would be lit up in the coming days to mark the decision.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit warned that the execution was only
delayed, not canceled.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the rebel organization and its supporters attempt to use this process
against the high interests of the state, then the process of delaying will be
halted and the process of execution will be started immediately,'' Ecevit said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ecevit's warning was an apparent attempt to appease the far-right National
Action Party, which has pressed for Ocalan's hanging, and relatives of those who
lost their lives fighting against the Kurdish rebels, who seek autonomy in
southeastern Turkey. Some 37,000 people, mostly Kurds, have died in the fighting
since 1984.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The leaders made a very wrong decision,'' said Mehdi Keskin, a lawyer for
Turks who lost family in the fighting. ``They have made the martyrs' families'
consciences bleed.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Ecevit said Ocalan's death sentence cannot be overruled.
</P>
<P>
	   He also made clear that Turkey would not wait long. Review of the case in
the European court could take up to two years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This decision does not mean that we will agree for a delay under any
condition that will last forever,'' Ecevit said.
</P>
<P>
	   Turkey has not executed anyone since 1984. European countries have all
abolished the death penalty and are urging Turkey to do the same.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The execution would cause more tension in Turkey and would not be good for
Turkey's society and industry,'' Wolfgang Peukart, an official of the European
court, said at a meeting in Ankara.
</P>
<P>
	   The EU named Turkey a candidate for membership last month -- a huge step for
the country, which has been working toward joining the union since 1963.
</P>
<P>
	   Leading up to Wednesday's meeting, speculation had grown that the issue
could trigger a breakup of Ecevit's government. The nationalists came to power
on a campaign promise to execute Ocalan and are under pressure from their
electorate to immediately send the Kurdish rebel's case to parliament for
approval.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Wednesday, hundreds of nationalist supporters gathered in the
capital, Ankara, at the funeral of soldiers killed in clashes with rebels
Sunday. They booed President Suleyman Demirel -- who favors waiting for the
European Court's ruling -- calling him a ``traitor.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Do not bargain on the blood of our martyrs!'' they shouted before marching
in downtown Ankara. They called on the government to resign.
</P>
<P>
	   Kurds also have also voiced their concern. On Tuesday, 37 elected mayors of
Turkey's only legal political Kurdish movement, the People's Democracy Party,
urged the leaders not to hang Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
	   Ecevit fears that hanging Ocalan could anger the Kurdish rebel group and
revive violence in southeastern Turkey. There has been a relative lull in
fighting in that region since Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers Party, known as the
PKK, announced a cease-fire and withdrawal from Turkey in August.

<HEADLINE> French Storms Leave $3 Billion Bill  </HEADLINE>
   By PAUL-HENRI DU LIMBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PARIS (AP) -- Storms last month that have left thousands of people still
without electricity or phone service will cost French public services $3
billion, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   He also said France will give about $630 million in direct aid to those
affected both by the devastating storms and by an oil spill that hit the
country's Atlantic coast over the same period.
</P>
<P>
	   The cost of fixing the electricity service alone came to $2.7 billion,
Jospin told a news conference. There was another $79 million worth of damage
done to the road network and the same amount done to the railroads. It cost $157
million to fix the national phone company, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The prime minister also outlined a ``forest plan'' to help replace the
thousands of trees ripped down by the gale-force winds and said it would cost
nearly $1 billion over the next decade. At least 741,000 acres of forest were
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
	   Ninety people died in storm-related accidents over the Christmas holidays
and on Wednesday, 26,000 homes were still without telephone service, while about
10,000 lacked electricity. Many people are still repairing roofs and hauling
away fallen trees.
</P>
<P>
	   The European Union on Wednesday denied a request from France for more storm
aid, saying some of the $5.4 billion the country gets over the next six years
could be used for reconstruction efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement, the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, said France
could apply for further storm aid under other programs, such as the rural or
fishery development aid programs.

<HEADLINE> Government: Let Whistles Blow  </HEADLINE>
   By DEB RIECHMANN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Train whistles -- nostalgic to some, a noisy nuisance to
others -- are being silenced at the expense of lives, federal regulators said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   They want nearly 250 communities that have banned whistles to let the
warnings sound once more if other steps aren't taken to improve safety at those
railroad crossings.
</P>
<P>
	   There were 431 deaths and more than 1,300 injuries in highway-rail crossing
accidents in 1998, the Federal Railroad Administration said Wednesday in
proposing a rule requiring train horns to be sounded at all public crossings.
</P>
<P>
	   When train horns are silenced at crossings with lights and gates, the
collision rate jumps 62 percent, said FRA Administrator Jolene Molitoris.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is really about life and death and how we can prevent truly preventable
injuries and deaths,'' Molitoris said. ``That's our goal.''
</P>
<P>
	   Train horns -- two long blasts followed by one short and one long -- are
standard practice at most of the 158,000 public railroad crossings across
America. But there are about 2,200 railroad crossings in 247 communities that
have enacted local bans prohibiting trains from sounding their horns.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the proposal, horns could be silenced only if other steps to improve
safety are taken in such ``quiet zones.'' At a minimum, all have to have gates
and lights. Additional steps that localities could take to get quiet zones
approved under the rule include installing cameras to catch violators or adding
extra gates or lane dividers to keep motorists from zigzagging around gates.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That S-move is well known where people try to beat trains where there's
only two gates,'' Molitoris said.
</P>
<P>
	   Localities can apply for federal and state grants and loans to help pay for
improvements needed to qualify as quiet zones, she said. The rule also proposes
an upper volume limit for train horns.
</P>
<P>
	   Public hearings on the issue will be held this spring in Ohio,
Massachusetts, Florida, Oregon, California, the District of Columbia, Indiana
and Illinois, where critics already are voicing opposition.
</P>
<P>
	   Noisy train whistles would affect the quality of life -- not to mention
property values -- in the Chicago suburb of Arlington Heights where developers
are spending millions of dollars to build housing near commuter rail lines,
Mayor Arlene Mulder said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I understand safety, but whistle blowing in and of itself will not
guarantee safety,'' she said. ``The real threat is to quality of life. We've
been working so hard to rebuild and revitalize downtown, and now they say
they're going to blow whistles?''
</P>
<P>
	   Leroy Jones, national legislative representative for the Brotherhood of
Locomotive Engineers, said urban sprawl, increased train traffic and Americans'
hurry-up approach to life have heightened the problem.
</P>
<P>
	   Jones, a former engineer, said blowing train horns would reduce deaths and
injuries from crossing collisions, which totaled 3,508 in 1998 -- the most
recent figures available.
</P>
<P>
	   On a bright December morning in 1978, two farmers in a pickup truck drove in
front of Jones' train traveling through Rose, Kan. The driver was thrown from
the truck and killed. The passenger died in Jones' arms.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I blew the horn. I put the train's emergency brakes on. The engine T-boned
the truck,'' Jones said. ``I had trouble sleeping. I had nightmares like four or
five months afterwards.''
</P>
<P>
	   Noisy train horns, however, have been too much to take for some residents in
Elkhart, Ind., east of South Bend. Gary Jilot, public works and utilities
director, said his city has petitioned state officials to prevent engineers from
blowing horns at 11 of 38 crossings in the community, which is home to a large
rail yard.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At some of these crossings there's like 85 trains a day. The long blasts
have gotten some people upset. They understand it in rural areas where they
don't have gates, but don't think they're needed where there's gated
crossings,'' Jilot said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One of the business leaders calculated how many horn blasts we had been
subjected to every day. It was astronomical.''

<HEADLINE> Government Bond Prices Fall Again  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Government bond prices fell for a third consecutive session
Wednesday, sending long-term yields to a 2 1/2-year high, as inflation jitters
sapped demand for U.S. Treasurys.
</P>
<P>
	   The price of the 30-year bond fell 7/16 point, or $4.37 1/2 cents per $1,000
in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.71
percent from 6.67 percent late Tuesday. That's the highest closing yield for
long-term Treasurys since it closed at that level on July 2, 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Bond traders have been edgy in advance of next month's meeting of Federal
Reserve policy-makers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed raised rates three times last year. There are expectations of
another boost in rates to cool off the economy and keep inflation under control
now that fears of a Year 2000 computer disaster have dissipated. But analysts
are divided on how much higher rates will go.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors will get a better reading on inflation on Thursday and Friday,
when the federal government issues reports on wholesale and consumer prices. In
addition, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan speaks to economists in New York on
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Rising interest rates hurt bonds, which pay a fixed rate of return.
</P>
<P>
	   In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities fell 1/16
point to 3/16 point and intermediate maturities fell 5/16 point to  1/4 point,
reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information service.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.43 percent as the discount rose
0.01 percentage point from Tuesday to 5.28 percent. Six-month yields were 5.69
percent, as the discount rose 0.05 percentage point from Tuesday to 5.45
percent. One-year yields were 6.11 percent as the discount rose 0.02 percentage
point from late Tuesday to 5.76 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the discount is the
interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was
5.50 percent, up from 5.25 percent late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer said the new contract for its index
of 40 actively traded municipal bonds fell 1/16 to 91 7/16. The average yield to
maturity rose to 6.29 percent from 6.28 percent on Tuesday.

	   The company earned 19 cents per share in the fourth quarter, easily beating
analysts' estimates of 15 cents per share. Yahoo! also announced a 2-for-1 stock
split. But company officials warned investors that Yahoo!'s revenue growth is
not sustainable.
</P>
<P>
	   The sneaker maker expects to report fourth-quarter earnings in the range of
40 cents to 50 cents per share. Analysts had anticipated earnings of 55 cents
per share. KSwiss said several footwear and sporting goods retailers delayed
orders during the quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said its results for the quarter ended Dec. 31 are likely to
fall below analysts' expectations due in part to concerns about the Year 2000
computer bug. Santa Cruz said many customers delayed purchases of its server
operating systems and network computing software.
</P>
<P>
	   The company has entered discussions with Red Hat Inc. to sell Red Hat's
Linux operating system to the federal government. Government Technology said it
plans to add Linux products and services to at least two of its government-wide
acquisition contracts.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Mixed; Dow Up 40.02  </HEADLINE>
    By EILEEN GLANTON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip industrial stocks once again stole the spotlight
from flashier technology shares Wednesday, pushing higher as investors shied
away from the slumping Internet sector.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 40.02 to close at 11,551.10. The Dow
lost some ground late in the session and failed to top Monday's closing record
of 11,572.20.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were lower. The Nasdaq composite index fell 71.17
to 3,850.02, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 6.31 to 1,432.25.
</P>
<P>
	   Yahoo! led a decline in Internet stocks. Shares of the Internet search
engine fell 39 13/16 to 357 9/16 a day after the company posted a
better-than-expected profit report. Yahoo! said late Tuesday it earned 19 cents
per share in the fourth quarter, above Wall Street's prediction of 15 cents per
share.
</P>
<P>
	   But company officials warned in a conference call that Yahoo!'s strong
revenue growth is not sustainable. Several Wall Street analysts stepped in to
defend the stock, but investors sold shares nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
	   America Online fell 3 7/8 to 60 1/8 as investors continued to fret about the
company's growth potential once it merges with Time Warner. AOL shares have
fallen 19 percent since the company announced its bold move to acquire the more
traditional media company.
</P>
<P>
	   Microsoft fell 3 9/16 to 105 13/16. Just before the close of Wall Street's
regular session, The Associated Press reported that government lawyers involved
in Microsoft's antitrust case want the company to break itself into three parts
to dilute its competitive advantage.
</P>
<P>
	   With technology stocks slipping, investors once again sought out relative
bargains in the industrial and consumer goods sectors. After lagging behind the
high-flying Nasdaq in the second half of 1999, the Dow Jones industrials have
outstripped other market measures so far this year.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, Merck rose 1 7/16 to 74 7/16, and McDonald's rose 1 3/4 to 42
3/4.
</P>
<P>
	   General Motors was the Dow's strongest component, rising 3 7/16 to 76 3/8
amid reports that Boeing will buy GM's Hughes Electronics Corp.'s satellite
manufacturing operations. Boeing edged up 3/16 to 43 1/16.
</P>
<P>
	   The broadening of the market beyond its earlier focus on high-tech has
created a healthier environment for investors, many analysts believe.
</P>
<P>
	   "Breadth has improved dramatically this year," said Gregory Nie, technical
analyst at First Union Securities in Chicago. "This market has a good enough,
healthy enough underpinning to support a real rally."
</P>
<P>
	   Still, stocks may struggle as investors await the next round of economic
indicators. On Thursday, the government will report on producer prices for
December, as well as retail sales. On Friday, the Labor Department will release
its Consumer Price Index, a widely watched gauge of inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   The reports should offer some indication of the Federal Reserve's next move
on interest rates. Many analysts believe the Fed will raise rates at its next
meeting on Feb. 1 and 2, and may impose further hikes later in the year to keep
inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
	   Higher interest rates can hurt stocks by cutting into corporate profits as
it becomes more expensive to borrow money.
</P>
<P>
	   Bond investors, highly sensitive to inflation and short-term rate changes,
Wednesday sent the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond to 6.71 percent from 6.67
percent late Tuesday. Bond yields are now at their highest levels since July
1997, pressuring stocks by offering lucrative, fixed returns.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's really not much that's more important to investing than
inflationary expectations and interest rates," said Robert Stovall, president of
Stovall/Twenty-First Advisers in New York. "Stock investors have been able to
brush off rising yields for a while, but at this level, they can't."
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on both the New
York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE composite volume totaled 1.19 billion shares, compared with 1.28
billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 2.57 to 490.04.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.0 percent. Germany's Xetra DAX
index rose 0.3 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 0.2 percent, and France's
CAC-40 fell 0.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Small college prepares for Clinton visit while mourning death of  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - As the staff of a small Brooklyn college prepares for
President Clinton's visit on Thursday, they're also mourning the death of one of
their colleagues, found murdered there earlier this week.
<P>
	   Who killed Jorge Cordova remained a mystery Wednesday. According to initial
police reports, investigators thought the 46-year-old had fallen down the stairs
at Boricua College, and, in a freak accident, punctured his chest with the pens
in his pocket.
</P>
<P>
	   But on Wednesday, the medical examiner's office ruled Cordova's death a
homicide. That puncture wound came from a bullet.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton is slated to help launch a small business development center on
Thursday at the private, four-year bilingual institution. The more than 1,000
students are predominantly Latino.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's visit will continue as planned, said White House spokesman
Jake Siewert.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is obviously a tragedy, but the president very much wants to visit the
college," Siewert said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cordova was found unconscious inside the school with a puncture wound and
blood on his chest after officers responded to a 911 call from Assistant Dean
John Guzman about a noise, police said. Cordova was taken to Woodhull Hospital
where he was pronounced dead shortly after 8 p.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   He had worked as a maintenance worker for about five years, said his boss,
Angel Reyes.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was a happy person - he never spoke about any enemies or anything like
that," Reyes said. "Everybody here loved him."
</P>
<P>
	   Cordova's family could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Neighbor Julissa Pena said Cordova, his wife, and their two daughters - ages
15 and 18 - were like family to her.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was a great father and also he was a good housewife, because he would
always be planting flowers. He would always cook," said Ms. Pena, 17.
</P>
<P>
	   She said her building's residents will miss Cordova's singing and guitar
playing.
</P>
<P>
	   "Every Saturday he would play his music loud and he would sing because he's
a great singer," Ms. Pena said, adding that Cordova was originally from Puerto
Rico, and came to the city when he was a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was a very friendly, very nice person," she said. "He used to come to my
house to put up the curtains, help out with anything we needed, help put in the
air conditioner, anything like that."
</P>

<HEADLINE> Adams: End Threats To Irish Peace  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Emerging from a meeting with President Clinton, Sinn Fein
leader Gerry Adams called on Protestant leaders Wednesday to stop threatening to
withdraw from Northern Ireland's governing coalition if the IRA doesn't begin
disarming by February.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Deadlines, ultimatums, have not worked anywhere in the world in terms of
trying to get peace processes to come to democratic conclusions,'' Adams said
after a 40-minute session with Clinton, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
and National Security Adviser Sandy Berger.
</P>
<P>
	   Adams said the White House meeting focused on issues of the Irish Republican
Army's weapons and the removal of British forces from Northern Ireland. Under
the 1998 Good Friday Accord, the IRA has until May to disarm. But the Protestant
leader of the administration, David Trimble, has said he will withdraw his
Ulster Unionist Party from the coalition if the IRA hasn't begun disarming by
February.
</P>
<P>
	   Sinn Fein is the IRA's political ally.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I look to David Trimble to be leaderly about all of these matters,'' Adams
said. ``Let's move forward empowered by the progress that has been made.''
</P>
<P>
	   National Security Council spokesman Mike Hammer would say only that the
officials had discussed ``all aspects of the implementation of the Good Friday
Accord.''
</P>
<P>
	   There has been much speculation that Clinton will return to Northern Ireland
once more before the end of his presidency. Hammer said the president remained
willing to travel if he could help advance the peace process, but that no trip
had been planned.
</P>
<P>
	   Adams said Clinton, as opposed to other unspecified players in the peace
process, ``understood clearly and has had a strategic vision ... that how you
make peace work is you bring about justice and you make politics work.''

<HEADLINE> Columbia Aid Package Scrutinized  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., wants the Clinton
administration to better explain what it hopes to achieve with its $1.6 billion
plan to bolster democracy in Colombia and at what risk.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We at least need to see a concerted effort by the Colombian Army to thwart
the paramilitary groups, who are responsible for most of the atrocities against
civilians, and a willingness by the Colombian Armed Forces to turn over to the
civilian courts their own members who violate human rights,'' Leahy said in a
statement Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Leahy, the ranking Democrat on the appropriations subcommittee that oversees
foreign spending, added that trying to compel the Colombian rebels to negotiate
by increasing counterinsurgency efforts is ``a costly and dangerous policy.''
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton, who proposed his spending plans Tuesday, acknowledged it
will take more than money fix the problems of drug violence and corruption in
Colombia. He said the aid would help stem the production and export of illegal
narcotics while supporting economic development and improving human rights.
</P>
<P>
	   The money would go to train special counternarcotics battalions and buy U.S.
helicopters for drug surveillance and eradication.
</P>
<P>
	   In Colombia, a leftist rebel spokesman warned Wednesday that Clinton's
proposal only will lead to more bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
	   The aid plan is a ``dangerous'' step that will escalate fighting without
reducing the flow of drugs to the United States, Ivan Rios said in an interview
in the rebel-held southern ranching town of San Vicente del Caguan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not the solution, but rather the worsening of the problem,'' said
Rios, a midlevel commander of the country's largest guerrilla band, the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright plans to travel to Colombia this
weekend to explain the package, which will be part of Clinton's fiscal 2001
budget. The funds dramatically would increase U.S. involvement in Colombian
President Andres Pastrana's anti-drug strategies.
</P>
<P>
	   Some Republicans, including House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., welcomed
the proposal, but they also raised concerns about effective delivery of U.S.
aid.

<HEADLINE> Israeli President Won't Resign  </HEADLINE>
   By DANA BUDEIRI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Embattled President Ezer Weizman resisted pressure to
resign Wednesday as police joined prosecutors in investigating whether he
illegally accepted $453,000 in gifts from a French millionaire.
</P>
<P>
	   Weizman's lawyers gave State Prosecutor Edna Arbel documents recording the
deposits allegedly made into Weizman's bank accounts between 1988 and 1993, when
he was a lawmaker and a government minister.
</P>
<P>
	   The head of police investigations, Yossi Sedbon, also joined the
prosecutor's probe on Wednesday. If the probe finds evidence of wrongdoing, the
police could be ordered to investigate, but Sedbon said police had not begun
such an investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Weizman denied reports that he was negotiating a plea agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm waiting for Edna Arbel's decision, and then I will respond,'' he told
reporters Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Arbel also questioned Weizman lawyer Hanina Brandeis, who says documents
relating to the financial transactions were stolen from his office. Israel's
Channel Two said police arrested a suspect in the alleged theft, but police did
not immediately confirm the report.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics calling for Weizman's resignation say that even if his actions were
not illegal, it was unethical for him to receive so much money while holding
public office.
</P>
<P>
	   Prime Minister Ehud Barak on Wednesday offered Weizman only guarded support.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am sure that, depending on the results, he will know how to behave,''
Barak told Israel's army radio.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein said the investigation was sensitive,
and that prosecutors were trying to finish it as quickly as possible. He and
other officials also denied that a plea bargain was in the works.
</P>
<P>
	   Weizman has acknowledged accepting money from millionaire Edouard Sarousi
but says the sum was less than alleged. He said he consulted his lawyer at the
time and was told there was no need to report or pay taxes on the gift.
</P>
<P>
	   In Israel, the president is a ceremonial figure, but the person in the
position wields a great deal of influence in business and political circles.
</P>
<P>
	   Weizman is the nephew of the country's first president, Chaim Weizmann, and
helped found and eventually command Israel's air force. He was an architect of
Israel's victory in the 1967 Mideast war, and was elected president in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   Weizman's second five-year term expires in 2003.

<HEADLINE> Court Mulls Grandparents' Rights  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- While acknowledging a ``special relationship'' between
grandparents and grandchildren, Supreme Court justices appeared troubled by
state laws that give grandparents broad rights to seek court-ordered visitation
against parents' wishes.
</P>
<P>
	   In an intense debate over an emotionally charged issue, the nation's highest
court on Wednesday assessed two competing values -- a state's desire to promote
children's best interests and parents' right to raise their children free from
government interference.
</P>
<P>
	   The way the justices resolve that conflict, in a decision expected by late
June, could touch every corner of America. Sixty million Americans are
grandparents. So are six of the court's nine members.
</P>
<P>
	   A majority of the justices voiced grave concerns about a Washington state
law that allowed ``any person,'' relative or nonrelative, to win a court-ordered
right to see a child any time such visitation was found to be in a child's best
interest.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Breathtakingly broad,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor called it before
asking one lawyer, ``Do you defend it ... any person, any time?''
</P>
<P>
	   Early in the hourlong session of arguments, Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist asked whether the law might allow a little girl's ``great aunt'' to
``come in and say, 'I want to take her to the movies every Friday.'''
</P>
<P>
	   And Justice Stephen G. Breyer indicated he was not about to favor a law that
would grant visitation rights to ``an accordion player who wants to visit once a
year,'' even if music lessons were in a child's best interest.
</P>
<P>
	   The state law also came under spirited questioning from Justices Antonin
Scalia and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
	   But Breyer also asked about the ``special'' nature of a case involving
grandparents seeking more time with their grandchildren. And Justice David H.
Souter, otherwise hostile to Washington's law, discussed the ``special
relationship'' a grandparent might have with a grandchild.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice John Paul Stevens, at 79 the court's oldest member, asked several
questions focusing on a parent's asserted ``absolute veto'' power over how often
grandparents can see their grandchildren. ``Is there no relief for a
grandparent?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
	   While all 50 states have laws allowing grandparents and others to seek
visitation after divorces or under other circumstances, only a handful of those
laws go as far as Washington's. The state's Supreme Court struck down the law in
late 1998, ruling it violated parents' rights.
</P>
<P>
	   That decision wiped out an Anacortes, Wash., couple's legal right to see
their two granddaughters.
</P>
<P>
	   Gary and Jennifer Troxel, who sat through the court proceeding, seek to
regain the right to see the two girls, 10-year-old Natalie and 8-year-old
Isabelle, more often than their mother, Tommie Granville Wynn, is willing to let
them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The court should balance all the interests,'' Seattle lawyer Mark Olson
argued for the Troxels, emphasizing the importance of letting children ``know
where they come from.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Seattle lawyer Catherine Smith, representing the girls' mother, said the
visitation order the Troxels obtained from a state court violated her client's
``right to make these decisions absent a showing that the children were being
harmed.''
</P>
<P>
	   The ``pernicious effect'' of Washington's invalidated law, Smith said, is a
parent being forced to defend ``a perfectly reasonable decision.... No one
should be brought into court for that kind of suit.''
</P>
<P>
	   The girls' father, Brad Troxel, committed suicide in 1993. He and Tommie
Granville were never married but had two daughters during their relationship.
When they separated, Troxel lived with his parents. The girls regularly visited
their father at the Troxels' home.
</P>
<P>
	   After the suicide, Natalie and Isabelle continued seeing their grandparents
regularly until their mother limited their visits.
</P>
<P>
	   The Troxels went into state court, and two years later were awarded
visitation of one weekend a month, one week during the summer and certain other
days.
</P>
<P>
	   While Granville appealed, she married Kelly Wynn. He then adopted the girls.
</P>
<P>
	   Rehnquist, Stevens, O'Connor, Scalia, Ginsburg and Justice Anthony M.
Kennedy are the court's grandparents. Two others -- Breyer and Justice Clarence
Thomas -- are parents but have no grandchildren. Souter is a bachelor.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas has other relevant experience: he was raised by his grandparents.
</P>
<P>
	   A survey released last week by AARP found about one in nine American
grandparents over the age of 50 helps care for at least one grandchild. The
survey showed that 8 percent provide day care regularly, and 3 percent function
as parents, rearing a grandchild.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Leader Rejects U.S. Aid  </HEADLINE>
   By BART JONES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez declined an
American offer Wednesday to send two shiploads of troops and equipment to help
after devastating floods, saying his country can handle the work on its own.
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement came a day after Pentagon officials said one Navy ship had
already left from Norfolk, Va. en route to Venezuela, and another was scheduled
to depart on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The USS Tortuga and the USS Nashville were to transport bulldozers, tractors
and engineering equipment along with about 450 Marine and Navy engineers who
were to lend a hand in clearing part of a key coastal road damaged in the floods
last month.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez told reporters that while Venezuela still needs more money, equipment
and other materials, additional relief workers aren't necessary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to clarify before Venezuela and the world that North American
troops are not going to come to Venezuela,'' Chavez said. ``If they want to send
machines or other types of equipment we are open to that, and we are very
thankful for the intention to help.''
</P>
<P>
	   It was not clear if the ships would be sent home given Chavez's comments and
spokespeople at the U.S. Embassy in Caracas, the State Department in Washington
and the U.S. military headquarters for Latin America in Miami had no immediate
comment. The troops were to be stationed in Venezuela for two months.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue of U.S. troops in Venezuela is a sensitive one, given Chavez's
left-leaning politics. A former army paratrooper, Chavez last year refused to
allow U.S. planes to fly over Venezuelan territory in anti-narcotics
reconnaissance flights.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez has also bolstered relations between Venezuela and communist Cuba,
and he often speaks of the need to reduce the U.S. influence in the world.
</P>
<P>
	   Between 15,000 and 30,000 people were killed after floods Dec. 15.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the United States has played a key role in international efforts to
assist Venezuela, providing airplanes, ships, soldiers, water purification
machines, medicine, money and other aid. Chavez accepted the initial U.S. aid
with open arms.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez said Wednesday that the disaster relief effort had moved into a
second phase following the rescue and evacuation of tens of thousands of flood
survivors. The new phase involves repairing and constructing roads, schools,
hospitals, houses and other buildings.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet May Face Charges in Chile  </HEADLINE>
   By KRISTIN GAZLAY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- Pressure mounted on Britain's top law enforcement official
Wednesday to release medical records that may spell freedom for ailing former
Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet, detained for 15 months on charges of
human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
	   The human rights group Amnesty International demanded that Home Secretary
Jack Straw release the records, at least to Spain -- as well as to France,
Switzerland and Belgium, which also requested Pinochet's extradition claiming
their citizens suffered abuses during his 1973-90 dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Many victims of Pinochet's crimes and the families of those who have been
murdered will feel betrayed if Pinochet is released on the basis of medical
evidence which is not going to be disclosed,'' said Geoffrey Bindman, an Amnesty
attorney.
</P>
<P>
	   Straw announced Tuesday that an independent medical exam on Jan. 5 by four
physicians was ``unequivocal and unanimous'' in finding the 84-year-old general
too ill to stand trial, opening the door for him to return to Chile within
weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   The panel's findings were not disclosed, although Straw told the House of
Commons that criteria considered included whether Pinochet would be able to
follow the proceedings, assist in his own defense and give coherent testimony.
Pinochet suffered two minor strokes in September. He also has diabetes and
arthritis and wears a pacemaker.
</P>
<P>
	   Straw gave the parties involved seven days to submit arguments before he
issues a final ruling on extradition to Spain, but gave no timetable for his
decision.
</P>
<P>
	   He noted that Pinochet had been asked to allow Spain and the other countries
involved to read copies of the medical report, but that the general ``declined
to do so.''
</P>
<P>
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair's Downing Street office issued a statement
Wednesday saying Pinochet was entitled to his privacy. In Washington, White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart said, ``This is a legal matter between Chile and
Spain.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pinochet was said by friends to be ``delighted'' by the latest twist in his
case. But his son said the family would put off celebrations until the general
boards a plane home.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A possibility indeed has opened for his return, but there is nothing firm
yet,'' Marco Antonio Pinochet said at a news conference in Santiago.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he talked Wednesday with his mother, Lucia, who told him Pinochet
received the news ``with a lot of calm, but little optimism. He remains
cautious.''
</P>
<P>
	   If Straw rules against extradition, Pinochet's opponents have a few
alternatives, all viewed as long shots -- appealing to the High Court;
attempting to launch a private prosecution; or convincing Britain's director of
public prosecutions to bring action.
</P>
<P>
	   But even if Pinochet returns to Chile, he faces the prospect of prosecution.
</P>
<P>
	   Pablo Cabrera, Chile's ambassador in London, said Chilean law has been
amended since the closing days of the Pinochet regime, when the dictator passed
a wide-ranging law granting himself immunity from prosecution. Pinochet
relinquished power in 1990, and became a senator for life.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The law in Chile allows the people and the tribunal to strip off immunity,
as has been done already with another senator for other reasons,'' Cabrera told
BBC Radio.
</P>
<P>
	   Pinochet has been detained in Britain since his Oct. 16, 1998, arrest in a
London hospital on the Spanish warrant. He is accused of using torture to
intimidate and silence political opponents throughout his dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
	   An official Chilean government report says 3,197 people -- including
citizens of Spain and other countries -- died or disappeared after the general
led a coup to topple the elected Marxist president, Salvador Allende.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the Spanish government said it would not challenge Britain's
decision, legal and human rights activists in Spain said the 15-month legal
battle against Pinochet proved that no one is above the law.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What's been important in all of this case has been to fight impunity,''
said Joan Garces, a lawyer for families of Pinochet victims who also worked with
Judge Baltasar Garzon, the Spanish investigative magistrate who filed the
extradition request that led to Pinochet's detention.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Whether the case takes place in Spain or in another country is beside the
point,'' Garces said. ``We have already won this case.''

<HEADLINE> Teen-agers used cyberscam to get credit card numbers, buy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   GALLOWAY TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - Four teen-age boys have been charged in
what police say was an Internet scam that used credit card numbers to defraud
hundreds of people around the country.
<P>
	   The teen-agers, ages 14 to 16, obtained credit card numbers by tricking
America Online and Earthlink subscribers into downloading files via the
Internet, according to Detective Jay Davies.
</P>
<P>
	   The files allowed the teen-agers to obtain the passwords, addresses, phone
numbers and credit card numbers of people in New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania,
Ohio, Florida, Nebraska, Texas and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
	   The alleged cyber scammers then used the credit card numbers to make about
$8,000 in purchases, arranging to have the merchandise delivered to unoccupied
homes, according to Davies.
</P>
<P>
	   In some of the cases, the teen-agers posed online as representatives of
America Online and e-mailed subscribers, telling them their account information
had been lost and that they had to provide it again.
</P>
<P>
	   "They call it 'carding,"' Davies said. "They also don't feel as if there are
any real victims because they're thousands of miles away and because they don't
have to stick a gun in some people's faces to get it."
</P>
<P>
	   The teen-agers, whose names weren't released, are all students at Absegami
High School.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're very average kids, from regular homes. With the exception of one,
I've never run into any of them before," Davies said.
</P>
<P>
	   The boys were arrested between Dec. 23 and Jan. 6 and charged with numerous
counts of fraud, conspiracy, credit card theft, theft of services, receiving
stolen property and other charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the victims was John Steinmetz, 79, of Northfield. He got suspicious
when a pair of snowboarding pants were delivered to his house and a company
called him seeking to verify his purchase of a paintball gun.
</P>
<P>
	   It wasn't clear why the pants were sent to Steinmetz's home. In other cases,
the merchandise arrived at the unoccupied homes - where the boys sometimes left
notes directing delivery services to leave the merchandise - and the boys picked
up the items later.
</P>
<P>
	   Police were alerted when John Bertino of Galloway Township complained to
them that charges for $1,000 in "kids stuff" - including a Sony Playstation -
had shown up on his Visa credit card.
</P>
<P>
	   Only about $2,500 worth of merchandise was actually received by the
teen-agers. It was seized by police in searches of their homes, as was $8,000
worth of computer equipment owned by the boys. The Atlantic County Prosecutor's
Office plans to examine the hard drives of the boys' computers to seek evidence
of more crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   Computer users - especially those who shop on-line - should beware of such
scams, Davies said.
</P>
<P>
	   "People need to be careful about who they give their credit card information
out to. Internet service providers don't ask for this information. You shouldn't
give credit card information to anyone who seeks it unsolicited," he said.

<HEADLINE> French Truck Owners Lift Blockades  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Traffic was moving again on French roads Wednesday after truck
owners lifted blockades that for two days had stalled foreign trucks at France's
borders in a protest over gas prices and a shorter work week.
</P>
<P>
	   While the bosses were appeased after late-night talks Tuesday with the
government, their drivers were not. They have promised their own blockades.
</P>
<P>
	   Truck owners had been protesting a 30 percent rise in diesel fuel prices
over the last year. But their main concern was a government program to reduce
unemployment by cutting the work week from 39 hours to 35. The bosses said it
would make truckers far less competitive than European counterparts.
</P>
<P>
	   During Tuesday's talks, Transport Ministry officials decided trucking
employees could work more than 35 hours a week if they were paid overtime beyond
the 35th hour. Truck owners will also receive tax breaks on diesel fuel.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Even though nothing has been signed, the state has made a promise to the
four professional unions. That is worth gold,'' said Guillemette de Fos,
spokeswoman for the FNTR union.
</P>
<P>
	   By Wednesday afternoon, all the barricades that had placed at French border
crossings had been removed.
</P>
<P>
	   But employees are unhappy with the concessions granted to the bosses because
truckers who drive only in France had been set to go onto the 35-hour workweek
program. Now they will have to work between 48 and 56 hours a week, like their
long-distance counterparts who travel through Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a real gift to the bosses. There is no reduction in working hours,''
said Alain Villette of the CFDT union. ``Once again, it's the employees who are
going to have to pay.''
</P>
<P>
	   Truck drivers have already called for a smaller round of blockades Jan. 31
and Feb. 1, and warned they could act sooner. Their unions met with Transport
Ministry officials Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   French truckers are among Europe's most militant. In November 1998, a strike
disrupted France and snarled traffic with neighboring nations for five days. In
1996, truckers stopped work for 12 days.
</P>
<P>
	   In October, truckers blocked roads and highways as part of Europe-wide
protests against plans to limit weekend driving in European Union countries.

<HEADLINE> DOT: Less Drivers Run Red Lights  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID HO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fewer drivers run red lights at intersections when
automatic cameras stand poised to snap photos of their license plates, the
government reports.
</P>
<P>
	   Using a camera enforcement program should reduce red-light running between
20 and 60 percent, the Federal Highway Administration said in a report presented
at a conference Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe that technology is key to making our highways safer,'' said
Virginia Miller, spokeswoman for the highway administration.
</P>
<P>
	   The report comes at a time when crashes are on the rise, with the number of
fatal intersection collisions increasing by 16 percent between 1992 and 1998.
All other types of crashes have increased only 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   There wasn't enough data on the relatively new technology to show if cameras
also reduced the number of intersection crashes, the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   Drivers who ran red lights caused 89,000 crashes in 1998, inflicting 82,000
injuries and causing nearly 1,000 deaths, according to the Transportation
Department. In 1997, more than 1.8 million intersection crashes occurred --
including those caused by red-light running -- resulting in more than 1.2
million injuries and more than 7,800 deaths.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You see more violations in rush hours when people are in a hurry,'' said
David M. Smith, a highway administration transportation specialist.
</P>
<P>
	   The new report presents the preliminary results of red-light camera programs
in three areas: Los Angeles County, Polk County, Fla., and Howard Country, Md.
All three received federal grants to test the technology.
</P>
<P>
	   In California, the cameras were used at crossings for a light rail line
running between Los Angeles and Long Beach. Between 1990 and 1997, there were
353 crashes between trains and cars, resulting in 33 deaths.
</P>
<P>
	   At the initial three crossings using cameras the number of drivers running
red lights dropped 92 percent, 78 percent and 34 percent, respectively, the
report said. Warning signs alerted drivers to the presence of the cameras.
</P>
<P>
	   Based on the positive results, the county transit authority decided to
install the cameras at 17 rail crossings.
</P>
<P>
	   Cameras in most states take photos from the rear of the intersection, so the
driver can't be seen, but the California program also used a picture of the
driver's face for identification.
</P>
<P>
	   Maryland's highly reflective license plates often hindered the camera's
effectiveness by creating too much glare for clear photos, but the test program
did reduce the overall number of red light violations at selected intersections
by 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   While not receiving federal funds, a New York City program started in 1993
resulted in a 38 percent decrease in violations at 18 monitored intersections,
the report said.

<HEADLINE> H&AMP;R Block Launches Expansion  </HEADLINE>
    By DANA FIELDS AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- H&AMP;R Block Inc. is breaking out of its homey image
as the neighborhood tax preparation office with a splashy, $100 million campaign
for its expanded Web site and lineup of financial services.
</P>
<P>
	   Timed to the start of tax season, the advertising blitz and the new Refund
Rewards program that debuted Wednesday culminate Block's three-year buying spree
of accounting and investment firms, including discount brokerage Olde Financial
Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   Block, with revenue of $1.3 billion last year, hopes to nudge some of its
16.5 million tax preparation customers toward its other products, including
financial planning and software. The Kansas City company typically has three
money-losing quarters a year.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our core business is as strong as ever, but it's seasonally oriented, and
the rest of the year we have this wonderful distribution system of 9,000 offices
we really don't use efficiently," chief executive Frank Salizzoni said from New
York, where Block executives were deployed Wednesday to call attention to the
new campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Block aired the first of 21 new commercials on Tuesday night's edition of
ABC's popular "Who Wants to Be A Millionaire," then announced Wednesday the
opening of 94 Block Financial Centers around the country. Some of the centers --
more of which will open in the coming year -- formerly housed Olde Financial
offices, others were Block Tax offices.
</P>
<P>
	   Customers at the Block Financial Centers will be able to talk not only with
tax preparers but with brokers and financial planners, Salizzoni said.
</P>
<P>
	   The company makes no secret of its target clients. It commissioned a Gallup
poll, released Wednesday, that found 48 percent of households with more than
$20,000 in income don't have financial plans. Two-thirds of that group don't
feel they save or invest enough -- and seven out of 10 have "some" or "great"
concern about paying for retirement.
</P>
<P>
	   "These clients also indicate they look upon H&AMP;R Block as a valued and
trusted final adviser and they would love to be able to get more than just tax
advice from Block," said analyst Michael Millman of Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
	   Offering financial advice in the unintimidating setting of a Block office
"makes Block's tax business much more attractive to clients, and makes
individual clients more profitable for the company," Millman said.
</P>
<P>
	   The fresh blast of publicity for Block's Internet services -- with links to
insurance and banking -- is also likely to pay off, said Michael Hodes, an
analyst with Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides online tax tools, the expanded Web site includes links to E-LOAN's
online mortgage business and to Citibank's new online banking service, Hodes
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "They don't so much expect to be the next etrade-dot-com but to get a
healthy amount of traffic in coming months on the tax site," Hodes said. "They
have their flag out and they're letting people know the door's open."
</P>
<P>
	   Other partnerships, unveiled Wednesday, are also seen as customer draws.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the Refund Rewards programs, taxpayers' refunds are loaded onto
prepaid buying cards that can be used for purchases -- at a discount -- from
General Motors, Sears, Radio Shack and other selected merchants.
</P>
<P>
	   The other major partnership offers discounts on Block tax and financial
services to the 13 million members of the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Block closed down 12 1/2 cents at $47.50 on the New York Stock
Exchange at 5 p.m.

<HEADLINE> Government: Let Whistles Blow  </HEADLINE>
   By DEB RIECHMANN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Train whistles -- nostalgic to some, a noisy nuisance to
others -- are being silenced at the expense of lives, federal regulators said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   They want nearly 250 communities that have banned whistles to let the
warnings sound once more if other steps aren't taken to improve safety at those
railroad crossings.
</P>
<P>
	   There were 431 deaths and more than 1,300 injuries in highway-rail crossing
accidents in 1998, the Federal Railroad Administration said Wednesday in
proposing a rule requiring train horns to be sounded at all public crossings.
</P>
<P>
	   When train horns are silenced at crossings with lights and gates, the
collision rate jumps 62 percent, said FRA Administrator Jolene Molitoris.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is really about life and death and how we can prevent truly preventable
injuries and deaths,'' Molitoris said. ``That's our goal.''
</P>
<P>
	   Train horns -- two long blasts followed by one short and one long -- are
standard practice at most of the 158,000 public railroad crossings across
America. But there are about 2,200 railroad crossings in 247 communities that
have enacted local bans prohibiting trains from sounding their horns.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the proposal, horns could be silenced only if other steps to improve
safety are taken in such ``quiet zones.'' At a minimum, all have to have gates
and lights. Additional steps that localities could take to get quiet zones
approved under the rule include installing cameras to catch violators or adding
extra gates or lane dividers to keep motorists from zigzagging around gates.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That S-move is well known where people try to beat trains where there's
only two gates,'' Molitoris said.
</P>
<P>
	   Localities can apply for federal and state grants and loans to help pay for
improvements needed to qualify as quiet zones, she said. The rule also proposes
an upper volume limit for train horns.
</P>
<P>
	   Public hearings on the issue will be held this spring in Ohio,
Massachusetts, Florida, Oregon, California, the District of Columbia, Indiana
and Illinois, where critics already are voicing opposition.
</P>
<P>
	   Noisy train whistles would affect the quality of life -- not to mention
property values -- in the Chicago suburb of Arlington Heights where developers
are spending millions of dollars to build housing near commuter rail lines,
Mayor Arlene Mulder said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I understand safety, but whistle blowing in and of itself will not
guarantee safety,'' she said. ``The real threat is to quality of life. We've
been working so hard to rebuild and revitalize downtown, and now they say
they're going to blow whistles?''
</P>
<P>
	   Leroy Jones, national legislative representative for the Brotherhood of
Locomotive Engineers, said urban sprawl, increased train traffic and Americans'
hurry-up approach to life have heightened the problem.
</P>
<P>
	   Jones, a former engineer, said blowing train horns would reduce deaths and
injuries from crossing collisions, which totaled 3,508 in 1998 -- the most
recent figures available.
</P>
<P>
	   On a bright December morning in 1978, two farmers in a pickup truck drove in
front of Jones' train traveling through Rose, Kan. The driver was thrown from
the truck and killed. The passenger died in Jones' arms.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I blew the horn. I put the train's emergency brakes on. The engine T-boned
the truck,'' Jones said. ``I had trouble sleeping. I had nightmares like four or
five months afterwards.''
</P>
<P>
	   Noisy train horns, however, have been too much to take for some residents in
Elkhart, Ind., east of South Bend. Gary Gilot, public works and utilities
director, said his city has petitioned state officials to prevent engineers from
blowing horns at 11 of 38 crossings in the community, which is home to a large
rail yard.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At some of these crossings there's like 85 trains a day. The long blasts
have gotten some people upset. They understand it in rural areas where they
don't have gates, but don't think they're needed where there's gated
crossings,'' Gilot said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One of the business leaders calculated how many horn blasts we had been
subjected to every day. It was astronomical.''

<HEADLINE> MCI Head Defends Sprint Merger  </HEADLINE>
    By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- MCI WorldCom's proposed marriage with long-distance
carrier Sprint is a "pro-consumer act," MCI WorldCom chief Bernard Ebbers said
Wednesday as he outlined steps the company will take to promote competition.
</P>
<P>
	   Ebbers sought to counter criticism that the deal between the No. 2 MCI
WorldCom and No. 3 Sprint, announced in October and originally valued at $115
billion, would hurt consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   "These concerns rest on a perception that's way out of date," Ebbers said at
the National Press Club.
</P>
<P>
	   Ebbers, the company's president and chief executive officer, also used the
event to announce some new offerings forthcoming from MCI WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
	   Soon after Bell Atlantic's rollout of combined local-long-distance calling
packages in New York, MCI WorldCom plans to offer its own all-distance service
in New York in about a month, Ebbers said. The package will include a large
variety of minutes, covering both local and long-distance calls, for a fixed
monthly fee, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ebbers said the company is developing a plan in New York for people who do
not make a large volume calls, without a monthly fee or minimum usage charge.
Consumer groups long have protested such fixed charges, saying that they are
keeping the cost of long-distance high for those that are infrequent callers.
</P>
<P>
	   That package eventually will be available nationwide, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ebbers also pledged that the merged company, within a year of closing the
deal, would accelerate its introduction of high-speed Internet connections --
delivered over Sprint's wireless network -- in rural and under-served areas.
</P>
<P>
	   But he added: "This deployment would not be possible and will not be
possible without our merger."
</P>
<P>
	   Addressing concerns that the marriage could raise prices, Ebbers asserted
that a combined MCI WorldCom/Sprint would not lead consumers to see even a 5
percent price increase in the markets the companies touch.
</P>
<P>
	   He attributed that to the level of competition already in the industry, with
some 600 long-distance carriers nationwide. Local Bell companies entering the
long-distance business will only add fuel to that fire, Ebbers said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bell Atlantic received permission last month to offer long-distance market
to its New York customers, and SBC Communications asked regulators this week for
approval to do the same in Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is too much competition and too much capacity," Ebbers said.
</P>
<P>
	   When the deal was announced, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Bill
Kennard said the companies would "bear a heavy burden to show how consumers
would be better off." Joel Klein, the assistant attorney general in charge of
the Justice Department's antitrust division, also promised at the time that the
deal would get "a very serious and thorough review."
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, Ebbers told reporters the company is confident with "minor
modifications" it will be able to make its case to regulators. The companies
hope to close their deal by the middle or third quarter of this year.

<HEADLINE> Ford Concept Car Creates Buzz  </HEADLINE>
    By JIM SUHR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- For years, auto shows have been used to debut
not-ready-for-prime-time cars, new ideas dressed up with gadgets and gizmos.
</P>
<P>
	   Automakers hope these concept cars create a buzz, much like Ford Motor's
"021C" -- a model one observer called deliberately controversial in blurring the
line between prototype and stunt.
</P>
<P>
	   Named by Ford Chief Executive Jac Nasser after the specific color of its
deep orange paint, the "retro-futuristic" machine looks like a first-grader's
sketch.
</P>
<P>
	   It has four doors, a single oval headlight and one tail light, swiveling
seats, and a trunk that slides open like a drawer.
</P>
<P>
	   The 021C is the brainchild of Australian-born designer Marc Newson, whom
Ford hired for one reason: he'd never created a car before. Newson has said he
wanted the car to be simple and naive, "like an egg in an egg cup."
</P>
<P>
	   But some people just don't get it.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought kind of like, 'Is Ford developing a Jetsons division?,"' said
AutoPacific Inc. analyst George Peterson, who first saw the 021C when it was
unveiled last October at the Tokyo auto show. The 021C reappeared here this week
at the North American International Auto Show.
</P>
<P>
	   Peterson said the car was rolled out simply to get attention. But, he added,
that's what car shows are for: "If nothing else, it got people to come into the
exhibit."
</P>
<P>
	   Mission accomplished for J Mays, Ford's design chief. Despite lukewarm
reviews for the 021C in media circles, Mays still beams about the attention
awarded to a machine he calls simple, honest and engaging.
</P>
<P>
	   "As expected, there have been some in the automotive press that didn't
understand it," Mays said, asserting that the industry -- Ford included -- has
been stuck in a design rut. "The point behind it is to reach a new generation of
customers not absolutely driven by a love for the auto, but who have an interest
in pop culture. Autos are supposed to be different."
</P>
<P>
	   Mays wouldn't say whether the 021C has any production potential beyond the
concept stage, which automakers traditionally use to gauge public reaction
before making the big investment needed to put their prototypes on the market.
</P>
<P>
	   While some elements of the 021C could show up in future cars -- including
its underseat storage and pillarless door frames -- some analysts say the whole
package will never make it to the showroom.
</P>
<P>
	   "You could build it, but where does it fit in the product lineup?" asked Jim
Hall, AutoPacific's vice president of industry analysis. "It could be the
next-generation Ford car, but I don't think that's what they want the car to be.
It's Ford's way of saying there are better ways to automotive designs. I won't
say it's a wakeup call, but an announcement."
</P>
<P>
	   The 021C has its fans. Jack Keebler, the Detroit editor of Motor Trend
magazine, said the car had a "studied naivete."
</P>
<P>
	   "This is an incredibly sophisticated car," Keebler said. "It looks simple,
but no one would look at an egg and say that's a simple design. ... Paint it
black and I want one."

<HEADLINE> Right To Sue Polluters Upheld  </HEADLINE>
   By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Private citizens won assurances from the Supreme Court on
Wednesday that they can seek enforcement of environmental laws against
polluters.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices, in a 7-2 decision, upheld citizen groups' right to sue an
alleged polluter even if the group were not directly harmed by the pollution or
could prove financial damages.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling also said polluters sued by private citizens cannot necessarily
avoid paying damages by stopping their misconduct during litigation.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision involved the dumping of toxic chemicals into a stream from a
South Carolina hazardous waste incinerator. Friends of the Earth and several
other environmental groups sued incinerator's operator in 1992, although these
groups were not directly harmed by the pollution.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling ``assures that citizens ... have the right to go to court to
enforce environmental laws,'' said Lois Schiffer, assistant attorney general for
environment and natural resources, applauding the court's finding.
</P>
<P>
	   The case against Laidlaw Environmental Services, operator of the
incinerator, was a test of the Clean Water Act's provision that allows private
citizens to file lawsuits to help enforce the law. Under the law, citizens can
seek an end to misconduct, plus financial penalties to be paid to the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This case had the potential to severely limit a citizen's ability to
enforce the Clean Water Act.,'' said Brian Dunkiel of Friends of the Earth. ``We
... are pleased that the court has maintained the status quo'' on citizen
participation.
</P>
<P>
	   The suit dealt with Laidlaw's operation of its waste incinerator in Roebuck,
S.C., that discharged wastewater into the North Tyger River.
</P>
<P>
	   By the time a federal judge ruled on the lawsuit in 1997, Laidlaw had come
into compliance of the Clean Water Act. While the judge found that the
environmental groups were not entitled to an order to deter future violations,
he imposed $405,800 in civil penalties for past violations.
</P>
<P>
	   A year later, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the penalty.
It said that once the judge decided not to ban future violations, the only
remaining remedy -- a civil penalty -- was not appropriate because it would not
benefit the groups who filed suit. Under the law, the money had to be paid to
the government.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Supreme Court said the civil penalty was intended to deter future
misconduct, and therefore it would, in fact, benefit the environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices ordered the case returned to a lower court to determine whether
Laidlaw could show that the case was moot because future violations could not be
expected to occur.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Congress has found that civil penalties in the Clean Water Act cases do
more than promote immediate compliance ... they also deter future violations,''
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A defendant's voluntary cessation of allegedly unlawful conduct ordinarily
does not suffice to moot a case,'' Ginsburg added. A case might be declared moot
if it were clear that the unlawful conduct could not reasonably be expected to
reoccur, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ginsburg's opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H.
Souter and Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
	   Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas dissented. Writing for the two,
Scalia said the ruling permited ``law enforcement to be placed in the hands of
private individuals.''
</P>
<P>
	   The case is Friends of the Earth vs. Laidlaw Environmental Services, 98-822.

<HEADLINE> CBS Logo Switch Raises Questions  </HEADLINE>
    By HANNAH WOLFSON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS News may have sacrificed journalistic ethics for the
sake of business by superimposing digital images of its logo over that of a
competitor during its newscast, media observers said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   CBS officials said they did nothing wrong when they used digital technology
to layer their name over a large NBC screen and a Budweiser advertisement during
live broadcasts of "CBS Evening News" from Times Square on Dec. 30 and Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   Although digital imaging has been used before to insert advertising on TV
screens during sports and entertainment programs, the leap into news has raised
questions about how it should be used.
</P>
<P>
	   "When there's new technology, the ethical rules have to be restated or
firmed up," said Richard T. Kaplar, vice president of The Media Institute, a
nonprofit think tank in Washington. "This may seem like an innocent little
corporate coup, but there are bigger implications in terms of eroding people's
confidence in what they see on the screen."
</P>
<P>
	   CBS' morning show, "The Early Show," has used the technology routinely since
its Nov. 1 debut to make it seem that a large CBS advertisement is attached to
the General Motors building in New York, where the show originates.
</P>
<P>
	   But CBS News President Andrew Heyward said the decision to use the
technology during the ultra-competitive millennium broadcast did trigger
internal debate, though there was no talk of notifying viewers.
</P>
<P>
	   "Reasonable people could disagree whether it is an appropriate use of
digital technology," Heyward said, "and like any new technology it poses new
issues we have to address on a case-by-case basis."
</P>
<P>
	   Heyward also said CBS has a "core principle" of not deceiving the audience,
and he doesn't believe the imaging violated that principle any more than the
standard use of printed graphics on the television screen.
</P>
<P>
	   CBS spokeswoman Kim Akhtar said Dan Rather knew during the newscast that
digital technology was being used to project the logo behind him, but was not
notified in advance.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC sparked controversy in 1994, when Washington correspondent Cokie Roberts
was introduced as reporting from the Capitol when she was actually standing in
the studio in front of an image of Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a mistake," said Eileen Murphy, spokeswoman for ABC News. "It should
never have happened and you won't see that happening again."
</P>
<P>
	   Although ABC uses digital imaging to create graphics for Monday Night
Football, including the first down markers only TV spectators can see, Murphy
said viewer credibility is too important to try it with the news. In a 1998
Gallup poll, 66 percent of respondents said they trust nightly network news and
CNN, a number topped only by local TV news.
</P>
<P>
	   "You have an obligation to your viewers in news programming to be truthful,
and we just see it as being a bit manipulative," Murphy said. "It could have the
potential to raise questions in viewer's minds."
</P>
<P>
	   Aly Colon of The Poynter Institute for Media Studies in St. Petersburg, Fla.
agreed.
</P>
<P>
	   "If what's behind (Dan Rather) is not accurate or real, then is what he is
saying or where he is or what he's trying to convey any more authentic than the
environment he's in?" Colon asked.
</P>
<P>
	   NBC said it has never used digital imaging during its nightly newscasts and
has no plans to do so.
</P>
<P>
	   Digital manipulation is not limited to television. Time magazine apologized
to readers in 1994 for featuring a darkened version of O.J. Simpson's mug shot
on its cover. And many newspapers have policies against the use of
digitally-enhanced photos.
</P>
<P>
	   But with technology accelerating, Colon said, the famous wall between the
journalistic and the business sides of the news may need shoring up.
</P>
<P>
	   "You have to think about why those walls are there and if you're going to
vault over them, what that implies," Colon said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think that it's going to be a very challenging element that the news
industry will have to address in terms of who's going to be responsible for the
news."

<HEADLINE> Teen Buddhist Leader Meets Devotees  </HEADLINE>
   By DEEPAK SHARMA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DHARMSALA, India (AP) -- The teen-age Buddhist leader who recently fled
Chinese-controlled Tibet met with devotees Wednesday while he rested at a
secluded monastery under tight security.
</P>
<P>
	   The 17th Karmapa gave red ribbons and grapes to his barefooted visitors, who
entered the Gyuto monastery in groups of 10 to 20 people and presented the
14-year-old lama with white scarves, said one of the devotees, who uses only the
name Dawa.
</P>
<P>
	   The Karmapa, leader of one of the four main streams of Tibetan Buddhism,
fled Tibet and arrived in Dharmsala a week ago after an eight-day trek over the
Himalayas. He moved on Sunday to the Gyuto monastery in Sidvari, 10 miles
southeast of Dharmsala, the Dalai Lama's home in exile.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, the Karmapa expressed his happiness that the Tibetan community
and others are making efforts to help him, Dawa said.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 50 Indian security men ringed the monastery. Some carried AK-47
assault rifles. All visitors were frisked twice, by Indian police and the Dalai
Lama's guards.
</P>
<P>
	   A man who claimed to be the Karmapa's uncle was questioned by Indian police
Wednesday after he protested outside the monastery and demanded to be allowed to
meet the lama.
</P>
<P>
	   Mamgiyal, who gave only one name, said the Karmapa's mother was in serious
condition and thousands of his supporters were thronging his home in Tibet,
anxious for information on the whereabouts and condition of the leader.
</P>
<P>
	   The Karmapa was recuperating at Gyuto with his principal teacher and
devotee, the Tai Situ Rinpoche.
</P>
<P>
	   About 130,000 Tibetans have fled to India since the Dalai Lama, Tibetan
Buddhism's supreme leader, escaped during a foiled uprising against Chinese rule
in 1959. Most of them are registered as refugees, a status they must renew every
year.
</P>
<P>
	   The Indian Foreign Ministry said it has not received a formal request for
the Karmapa's political asylum. On Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman
Zhu Bangzao advised India to keep relations between the two neighbors in mind
when dealing with the Karmapa, but stopped short of saying India should deny him
asylum.
</P>
<P>
	   Bangzao reminded India of its recognition of Chinese sovereignty over Tibet
and a commitment to prevent the Dalai Lama from engaging in political activity
from Indian territory.

<HEADLINE> Doctors Warned on Flu Drugs  </HEADLINE>
    By LAURAN NEERGAARD AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government warned doctors Wednesday to make sure they
appropriately prescribe those heavily advertised -- but only somewhat helpful --
new flu drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   The Food and Drug Administration is looking into a handful of reports of
patients possibly treated inappropriately.
</P>
<P>
	   The warning also comes because the nation is in what health officials say
appears to be a normal influenza epidemic -- lots of misery but so far no worse
than each year's epidemic -- yet influenza is getting tremendous media
attention. Also, new flu drugs Relenza and Tamiflu are being promoted heavily.
</P>
<P>
	   "We want to make certain that physicians aren't thinking of these drugs
before they would think to use antibiotics" or other medicines, said FDA
antiviral chief Dr. Heidi Jolson.
</P>
<P>
	   FDA's first warning: Flu drugs do not prevent people from catching
influenza. Vaccination is the best way to do that.
</P>
<P>
	   It is not too late to be vaccinated, although some regions may start running
low on vaccine, said Dr. Keiji Fukuda of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. He advised people at highest risk -- the elderly and people with
chronic heart or lung conditions such as asthma -- to ask their doctor about
vaccination.
</P>
<P>
	   When doctors do prescribe the new flu drugs, the FDA warned:
</P>
<P>
	   --Patients with severe flu-like symptoms, especially those with chronic
medical conditions, may have serious bacterial infections like pneumonia instead
of influenza. Neither the new Relenza and Tamiflu, nor two older flu medicines,
can help bacterial pneumonia. Those patients need antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDA has received reports of three people who died from bacterial
infections who at least initially may have been given flu drugs instead of
antibiotics, Jolson said.
</P>
<P>
	   --The flu drugs only work if taken within the first 48 hours of flu symptoms
-- and they then reduce flu symptoms only by about a day.
</P>
<P>
	   "If they are used, it should be with a realistic expectation of the likely
benefit from the drugs, which I would characterize as modest," Jolson said.
</P>
<P>
	   --Use special caution in prescribing Relenza, which is an inhaled drug, to
patients with underlying asthma or other lung disease because it might trigger
asthma attacks or wheezing. Although Relenza comes with a warning about that
side effect, the FDA has received four reports of asthma attacks in such
patients, a small number but one that signaled doctors needed a reminder, Jolson
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Wednesday, the FDA revealed that in November it had ordered Relenza
manufacturer Glaxo Wellcome to stop airing misleading television ads implying
the drug is more effective than it really is.

<HEADLINE> Arguments on Grandparent Rights  </HEADLINE>
   By REBECCA SINDERBRAND Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As arguments over grandparent visitation rights were
ending Wednesday inside the Supreme Court, the squabbles outside were just
getting started.
</P>
<P>
	   Small knots of protesters spilled onto the sidewalk outside the court
building and confronted each other verbally, as lawyers and outside
organizations on both sides of the issue took turns repeating the day's court
arguments for waiting reporters and television cameras.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The grandparents and children have needs that have to be considered as
well'' as the parents' wishes, said Mark Olson, attorney for Tommie Granville
Wynn, mother of Natalie, 10, and Isabelle, 8.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think any of us are in a position to know what's in the best
interest of children. Parents are the ones in that position,'' said attorney
Catherine Smith, who represented Gary and Jennifer Troxel, the children's
grandparents.
</P>
<P>
	   Brad Troxel, the couple's son and the girls' father, committed suicide in
1993.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Children have a right to have contact with their grandparents,'' said
Davis Levy, president of the Children's Rights Council, an organization whose
stated goal is to ``demilitarize the divorce process to ensure children remain
in contact with parents and extended family.''
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the Family Research Council handed out a statement which read, in
part, ``In the age of splintered families, the government needs to uphold the
family unit, not break it down by granting unrelated third parties equal access
to children.''
</P>
<P>
	   At least one grandfather standing outside the court agreed with the FRC. ``I
think parents have the right to raise children the way they see fit. As long as
they're fit parents, this is a decision the parents have to make,'' said Carl
Argiroff of Livonia, Mich.
</P>
<P>
	   But there was a large group of very vocal senior citizens on hand who
supported the Troxels. ``If it wasn't for grandparents, the grandkids wouldn't
even be here!'' yelled a man on the edge of the crowd.
</P>
<P>
	   Jennifer Troxel sounded tired as she remarked, ``It's been good to have a
day in court, but I'm glad it's finally over.''

<HEADLINE> Ecuador's Interest Rates Drop  </HEADLINE>
   By GONZALO SOLANO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- President Jamil Mahuad's decision to use the U.S.
dollar as Ecuador's official currency is already paying dividends for his
nation's chaotic economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Annual interest rates on loans between banks plunged from 200 percent to 20
percent Tuesday, said Jorge Guzman, Ecuador's banking superintendent.
</P>
<P>
	   The drastic reduction ``indicates that market rates will probably approach
international levels when the dollar comes into full force,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Central Bank's board of directors approved a plan Monday to replace the
sucre with the dollar over the next year, but only after Mahuad threatened to
call a special session of Congress to fire any Central Bank executives who tried
to block the change.
</P>
<P>
	   Central Bank President Pablo Better quit in protest.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday, Mahuad had announced that he was pegging the exchange rate at
25,000 sucres to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
	   The precipitous drop in interest rates between banks on Tuesday is the first
indication that fixing the exchange rate to the dollar is having a positive
economic impact.
</P>
<P>
	   Mahuad predicted that once the economy stabilizes, annual interest rates on
personal loans in dollars would run between 12 percent and 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Olmedo Farfan, head of the School of Economics at the University of Espiritu
Santo in Guayaquil, said that the reduction in interbank rates was misleading
and would not necessarily result in lower interest rates for personal loans.
Those rates would remain high until banks have a clearer idea of how the move
toward a dollar economy will affect operations.
</P>
<P>
	   Production Minister Juan Falconi said in a television interview that tying
Ecuador's economy to the dollar could help reduce inflation, which topped 60
percent in 1999, the highest in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If in the United States, the country that produces the money, inflation
runs at 4 percent, at year's end in Ecuador it will reach 5 percent.''
</P>
<P>
	   The sucre recently plunged 20 percent in less than a week to 29,000 to the
dollar. A year ago, the sucre was valued at 7,000 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
	   Mahuad, a political centrist who took office in August 1998, has faced
growing calls to resign after failing to stop the rapid decline of Ecuador's
economy, which contracted 7 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Many economists predicted that speculation against the sucre would quickly
send Ecuador into hyperinflation this year if the government did not act.
</P>
<P>
	   By eliminating the sucre, Mahuad has ruled out printing extra money to meet
the budget, thus eliminating a major cause of inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   Mahuad's rivals in Congress and labor leaders have criticized his decision
to set the conversion of sucres to the dollar at 25,000 to one dollar, saying
the exchange rate would impoverish thousands of people with savings in sucres.
</P>
<P>
	   Leftist-led organizations that demonstrated last week in Ecuador's main
cities to demand Mahuad's resignation resumed protests Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Police used tear gas to disperse about 300 demonstrators, mostly students,
who tried to march on the presidential palace and to disrupt traffic in Quito's
center.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense Minister Jose Gallardo, a retired army general, was replaced
Wednesday by Gen. Carlos Mendoza, the head of the armed forces, in what appeared
to be a move by Mahuad to give the military a greater role in confronting
spreading protests.

<HEADLINE> Ivorian Opposition Joins Government  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- A leading opposition party on Wednesday joined
Ivory Coast's interim government, ending the West African country's first major
political deadlock since junta soldiers took power in a Christmas Eve coup.
</P>
<P>
	   Four members of the Ivorian Popular Front (FPI) took part in their first
Cabinet meeting Wednesday along with 17 other ministers drawn from the army and
other parties, said Emile Doudou Boga, a senior FPI official.
</P>
<P>
	   The FPI originally had refused to join the Cabinet, complaining that Gen.
Robert Guei had offered them only four ministerial positions.
</P>
<P>
	   The party eventually changed its position after Guei offered another two
Cabinet posts, Boga said. The new ministers are expected to be announced later
this month.
</P>
<P>
	   Guei emerged as Ivory Coast's first junta leader during the coup, which
toppled President Henri Konan Bedie. It was the first-ever military takeover in
Ivory Coast -- one of Africa's most prosperous and stable nations -- since its
independence from France in 1960.
</P>
<P>
	   The interim government is led by Guei, who declared himself president and
defense minister.
</P>
<P>
	   The FPI's rivals, the Rally of the Republicans (RDR), was officially given
three Cabinet posts. However, the FPI earlier complained that as many as 10
ministers were RDR supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   RDR leader Alassane Dramane Ouattara on Wednesday welcomed the opposition
party's decision.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am happy to note today that the FPI is entering the transition
government. Now we have to see how the government will function,'' Ouattara
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Guei has said the interim government will rule Ivory Coast until elections
can be held, but he has not given a timetable.

<HEADLINE> Federal judge appoints monitor to oversee troubled boxing group  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A federal judge on Wednesday appointed a New Jersey
lawyer as monitor for the scandal-ridden IBF, the first time a U.S. sports
organization has come under a stewardship generally reserved for mob-riddled
labor unions.
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge John W. Bissell appointed Joseph A. Hayden Jr. to
oversee the operations of the East Orange-based International Boxing Federation,
one of the sport's three major governing organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a major step forward to free the IBF from the shackles of
corruption that have bound it virtually since its inception," U.S. Attorney
Robert J. Cleary said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cleary's prosecutors asked for a monitor in November after indicting and
suing IBF founder Robert W. Lee Sr. on charges he took bribes to rig its
rankings of boxers.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee took a leave as IBF president last month as lawyers for himself and the
IBF argued that a monitor was not needed.
</P>
<P>
	   But Bissell found "ample evidence presented to demonstrate a pattern of
illegal activity through the solicitation and receipt of payoffs allegedly for
the purpose of fixing rankings or scheduling boxing matches."
</P>
<P>
	   Although Lee and his codefendants took voluntary leaves, Bissell removed
them from their positions and asked the monitor to determine if the IBF should
still be paying them reduced salaries and legal fees.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee, who founded the IBF in 1983, and the others are accused of taking a
total of $338,000 in bribes to change the rankings of the IBF. Rankings play a
big role in determining fight opponents and purses for boxers.
</P>
<P>
	   IBF lawyer Linda P. Torres said Hayden was a good choice, and that Bissell
correctly declined to give him the sweeping authority sought by prosecutors,
which Torres said would have amounted to a takeover.
</P>
<P>
	   "What we want to do is ensure the integrity of both the way the organization
operates, and particularly the rankings," Torres said. The IBF's five employees
are "ready, willing and able to cooperate with anything the monitor wants to
do."
</P>
<P>
	   Lee's lawyer did not immediately return a call Wednesday seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Hayden, who practices in Weehawkin, was the founder and first president of
the New Jersey Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. He did not return a call
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
	   He is married to U.S. District Judge Katharine S. Hayden, who sits in the
same courthouse as Bissell.
</P>
<P>
	   Bissell's order, which took effect immediately, granted Hayden broad powers,
but did not give him the authority to issue subpoenas, which had been sought by
the U.S. attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
	   Hayden got the authority to attend all executive committee meetings, examine
all records and guarantee that the IBF's boxing decisions are made fairly.
</P>
<P>
	   The monitor can take steps to remove IBF personnel he suspects are involved
in misconduct, and can get expert help to conduct IBF business. It was not
immediately known what Hayden knows about the sport.
</P>
<P>
	   Monitors have been installed a dozen times in the 20-year history of the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act, generally to cleanse
mob-riddled labor unions.
</P>
<P>
	   Zachary Carter, the former U.S. attorney for Brooklyn, Queens and Long
Island, was the initial choice of prosecutors to become the IBF monitor. Bissell
selected Hayden from lists of possible monitors that he asked prosecutors and
defense attorneys to submit to him.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge ordered the lists kept secret, so Cleary declined to say whether
Hayden was on his list.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge in November imposed spending limits on the IBF. The organization
replaced Lee in December with longtime IBF vice president Hiawatha Knight of
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors have disclosed that videotaped evidence shows Lee taking bribes
and improperly manipulating the ratings committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee, 65, of Fanwood, faces racketeering, conspiracy, money laundering and
tax evasion charges. He has pleaded innocent to all charges, and a trial could
begin this spring.
</P>
<P>
	   The IBF board granted him a leave of absence Dec. 7 at his full $165,000
salary, which was recently reduced to $25,000.
</P>
<P>
	   The IBF board also has agreed to pay $250,000 of Lee's legal fees, and
$50,000 for each of his three codefendants. If any are found guilty, they must
repay the money.
</P>
<P>
	   The indictment said seven promoters and managers were involved in payoffs to
the IBF to alter rankings or give favorable treatment to 23 boxers. They have
not been charged, and the indictment refers to them only by number.

<HEADLINE> Boeing, Hughes Stock Climb on Rumor  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL WHITE AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Boeing is in talks to acquire the satellite-making
business of Hughes Electronics Corp., according to an unconfirmed report
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing would pay $4 billion for the operations, according to Dow Jones
Newswires, citing unidentified sources familiar with the deal.
</P>
<P>
	   Spokesmen for Boeing and Hughes declined to comment on the report.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal would make Boeing a dominant player in the commercial satellite
industry, which is now led by Hughes with about 40 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
	   The report boosted Hughes shares by 4 percent, to close up $4.43 3/4 at
$108.12 1/2 at 5 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange. Boeing shares rose 18 1/4
cents to $43.06 1/4.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes is owned by General Motors Corp., but its shares trade separately
from regular GM shares.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing wants to position itself broadly in the aerospace market, said Jon
Kutler, president of Quarterdeck Investment Partners, an investment bank
specializing in aerospace acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
	   The move would reduce its dependency on jet airliner sales, and put the
company in position to capitalize on potential growth in the commercial
satellite industry. The purchase also would reflect some uncertainty on Boeing's
part as to which areas of aerospace will become the most lucrative in the next
century, Kutler said.
</P>
<P>
	   "For Boeing, it's hard to sit here and decide which way things are going to
go, and they want to be represented across the board," Kutler said. "They're
trying to have their arms in most of the major areas of the space market in
order to be well-positioned regardless of how the market goes."
</P>
<P>
	   The deal would complete the transformation of Hughes from a major military
aerospace contractor to what would become primarily a commercial
telecommunications company.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes was founded as Hughes Aircraft by wealthy eccentric Howard Hughes in
1932 and branched out into defense electronics after World War II. The company
began to move into commercial ventures, such as DirecTV, after the end of the
Cold War.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes shares have more than doubled during the past year, driven by the
growth of DirecTV. The service, with more than 8 million subscribers, had
revenue of $1.05 billion in the third quarter, up from $408 million in the third
quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes, however, has spent heavily developing the subscriber base. The
company lost $29.6 million in the third quarter, mainly because of expenses from
its acquisition of two satellite-TV rivals, as well as higher satellite costs.
</P>
<P>
	   The sale of its satellite manufacturing business would provide cash Hughes
needs to continue developing DirecTV and other communications businesses, said
Paul Nisbet, an analyst with JSA Research.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes shed its aircraft operations in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a company that had a lot of money after selling off Hughes Aircraft to
Raytheon, but they've gone through that and now they're substantially in debt,"
said Nisbet. "This would be a source of funds to keep their growth going in
these new fields."

<HEADLINE> Disney Studio Chief Resigns  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GERMAIN AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Joe Roth, the Disney movie chief who marshaled the
studio to box-office dominance for half a decade, said Wednesday he was quitting
to form an independent film company.
</P>
<P>
	   He will be replaced as Disney studio chairman by Peter Schneider, who has
worked for the company since 1985 and served as studio president under Roth for
the last year. The change is effective Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Roth said he wanted to be his own boss after nearly six years overseeing
Disney's film business and a previous stint as head of 20th Century Fox studios.
</P>
<P>
	   Disney Chairman Michael Eisner and Roth denied reports that there had been
friction between them, particularly over statements Eisner made a year ago about
the company's movie performance. In a letter to shareholders, Eisner had said
that despite good revenues, Disney films were not as profitable as he wanted due
to costly talent deals.
</P>
<P>
	   Roth said he may have felt the comments were a personal criticism, but that
the remarks had nothing to do with his leaving.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's just human for me to be reactive," Roth said.
</P>
<P>
	   But, he added, "That does not have one iota to do with this. It's 100
percent about me wanting, after spending 10 years working for Rupert Murdoch at
Fox and Michael Eisner, to strike out on my own."
</P>
<P>
	   Eisner said Wednesday his comments had not been intended as criticism of
Roth.
</P>
<P>
	   "Joe is not to blame for this. The industry is to blame for this," Eisner
said, adding that Roth has been instrumental in getting Disney's film costs
under control during the past two years.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have not had one inkling from Joe, ever, of discontent with the way we
operate," Eisner said. "He and I operate very well together. We were totally on
board as far as strategy."
</P>
<P>
	   Disney's profits fell 28 percent to $1.3 billion in the company's last
fiscal year as revenue growth slowed.
</P>
<P>
	   Even so, Roth's departure follows a record year at the box office for
Disney, which was the top film distributor worldwide with $2.6 billion in ticket
sales and No. 1 domestically with $1.24 billion. Actually, Disney has led the
global box office for five of the last six years.
</P>
<P>
	   The studio's 1999 releases included "The Sixth Sense," which has taken in
$276 million domestically, and "Toy Story 2," which has grossed $220 million --
the first time two films from the same distributor topped the $200 million mark
in one year.
</P>
<P>
	   The resignation is the latest in a string of high-profile departures among
top Disney brass in the last few years, including chief financial officers Steve
Bollenbach and Richard Nanula, ABC TV and radio station chief Steve Burke, and
cable programming boss Geraldine Laybourne.
</P>
<P>
	   Disney also has suffered through costly severance settlements with former
top executives Jeffrey Katzenberg and Michael Ovitz.
</P>
<P>
	   "Clearly, there's people in the speculation camp who will continue to say
it's not a good thing, the revolving door continues," said Katherine Styponias,
an analyst for Prudential Securities. "But the company has weathered these sort
of departures before. They'll probably weather this one."
</P>
<P>
	   Roth joined Disney as motion picture chief in 1994 and became studio boss
two years later, overseeing film, TV, video and animation production. Other
Disney hits on his watch have included "Tarzan," "The Waterboy" and
"Armageddon."
</P>
<P>
	   He was chairman of 20th Century Fox from 1989 to 1992, when he left to form
Caravan Productions, a company that produced films financed by Disney. Roth also
was co-founder of Morgan Creek productions before he went to Fox.
</P>
<P>
	   Roth said he has not lined up financing yet for his new company. He and
Eisner said Disney could possibly distribute some of Roth's films.

<HEADLINE> Driver's license renewals in New York will require eye exam  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Drivers renewing their licenses in New York state
will have to pass eye exams as of April 1.
<P>
	   In something of a reversal of policy for Gov. George Pataki, his Department
of Motor Vehicles will require eye exams from drivers under a new,
once-every-eight-years license renewal schedule.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, Pataki vetoed legislation which would have required eye exams,
saying the testing would have been too expensive for the DMV to conduct and he
was not convinced of the traffic safety benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   Since Pataki's veto, the DMV's medical advisory board has recommended that
eye exams be reinstituted, Division of Budget spokesman Kevin Quinn said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, the new measure differs from the 1997 legislation in that it will cost
$400,000 a year to administer, instead of $2 million, because renewals will be
done every eight years instead of every five, according to Quinn.
</P>
<P>
	   Since 1994, motorists renewing their licenses have been permitted to do so
by mail by self-certifying that they have acceptable vision. Vision tests are
required for someone getting a license for the first time.
</P>
<P>
	   The state is working on a plan that would allow drivers to mail in
certificates from health care providers attesting to passage of eye tests so
that the drivers wouldn't be required to go to DMV to renew, Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're looking to make this as easy and as customer friendly for drivers as
possible," Quinn said. "Having drivers across the state take vision tests will
certainly improve safety for everyone on New York's roadways."
</P>
<P>
	   Studies have shown that states without vision tests for drivers had higher
accident and death rates, particularly in age groups over 65, said Dr. Robert
Kennedy, president of the New York State Ophthalmological Society.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're happy that the governor has agreed to reinstitute the driver's
license vision testing requirement," Kennedy said. "We're just not sure that
eight years is often enough."
</P>
<P>
	   As long as age is not the determining factor in whether eye exams are
required, then reinstituting the exams is fine, said Michael Burgess, executive
director of the Statewide Senior Action Council.
</P>
<P>
	   "Somebody 45 could have something wrong with their vision or if they've had
illness," Burgess said. "These things should be health-related, not
age-related."
</P>
<P>
	   The measure, which does not require legislative approval, will effect
roughly 2 million motorists a year, but not commercial license holders, Quinn
said. The commercial renewal schedule will stay at five years and eye exams were
already required.
</P>
<P>
	   The $5 annual fee for renewals will not change. Drivers will pay $43 for
eight years, including an existing $3 photo document fee. Currently, drivers pay
$28.

<HEADLINE> With primaries drawing closer, airwaves get sharper  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - So much for the high road.
<P>
	   Steve Forbes is filling airwaves with ads that go after George W. Bush on
taxes. Bush is bristling back. Orrin Hatch is airing a 28-minute denunciation of
President Clinton. Interest groups are taking their agendas to the airwaves,
slamming candidates who don't agree with them.
</P>
<P>
	   And Al Gore, who promised Wednesday to run a positive campaign, is readying
an ad that at least subtly jabs Bill Bradley on farm policy, suggesting the vice
president is the lone candidate who cares about farmers.
</P>
<P>
	   Voters say they want a positive discussion of issues, and early ads have
been mostly positive. But with just 12 days until the first votes are cast, the
campaign for president was starting to take a nastier turn.
</P>
<P>
	   "When you get behind, you get desperate to try to move the (poll) numbers,
and you're willing to try attacks," said Bill Benoit, who studies political
advertising at the University of Missouri. "The fact that voters say they don't
like negative ads doesn't mean they don't work."
</P>
<P>
	   Fearing a backlash, candidates promise to stay positive.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't believe in negative campaigning," Bush told reporters Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Just days ago, his campaign was taping footage for a sharply worded ad
showing people on the street criticizing John McCain's tax plan. Then Bush and
McCain agreed during a debate to forgo negative ads.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's campaign put the ad on the shelf. But a college student who was
filmed, Heidi Quigley, wasn't happy about being coached to poke at McCain, and
she defected to the Arizona senator's camp.
</P>
<P>
	   That left Bush aides pedaling backward, saying they were simply preparing in
case McCain went negative first. "There is no ad, so there is no issue," said
Mark McKinnon, Bush's media adviser.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about the situation Wednesday, Bush said, "The ad will not run." He
added, "I'm going to treat my friend and opponent with respect."
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's campaign didn't buy the Bush line. "Taping a negative ad and then
promising not to run it is the high-tech version of smoking pot without
inhaling," said Dan Schnur, a McCain spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   Another GOP rival, Steve Forbes, is flooding Iowa airwaves with an ad
accusing Bush of breaking a Texas promise not to support tax hikes. In the ad,
an anti-tax activist accuses Bush of "a record of broken promises" on taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, Bush supported a tax-cut bill that included some increases to the
sales tax, which critics say was a violation of his no-new-taxes pledge, made in
1994.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush is responding. In a new ad planned for Iowa, Bush promises to run a
campaign free of "cynical and negative politics." He also says, without naming
Forbes, that "my opponent has chosen to run a negative campaign," advisers said.
</P>
<P>
	   He's hoping Iowa voters will recall how Forbes used a barrage of negative
ads to weaken eventual nominee Bob Dole during the 1996 primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   The Democratic jousting over the airwaves is more subtle.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore is preparing a TV ad for Iowa in which a home state senator, Tom
Harkin, calls the vice president the only candidate who really cares about
farmers. Like other ads, it will not mention Bradley by name.
</P>
<P>
	   But Iowa voters are sure to get the message. In other ads, Gore declares he
is the "only Democrat" who will protect Medicaid and Medicare and the "only
Democrat" who has made education a priority.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Gore is promising to stay positive.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think that people want to know how you can make this a better country,
not how you can attack somebody else," he said Wednesday in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's ads make similar, subtle contrasts with Gore. In one, he says that
"people" accuse him of offering risky ideas. Those "people" are the vice
president and his allies.
</P>
<P>
	   In the same ad, Bradley declares the "real risk" is in doing nothing about
gun control, child poverty and the uninsured. Bradley says the "do nothing" tag
wasn't intended for Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   While candidates fear that attacking their opponents will backfire, outside
groups regularly do it.
</P>
<P>
	   An abortion rights group recently ran ads saying Bush poses a "grave risk"
to legal abortion. The Sierra Club has its own ads accusing the Texas governor
of doing little for the environment. McCain has been hit in ads by anti-tax
activists and anti-abortion groups.
</P>
<P>
	   One ad feeds on another, and TV viewers should expect plenty more this year
from groups of all political stripes, said Larry Sabato, a political scientist
at the University of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a matter of keeping up with the Joneses," he said. "If some of your
competitor interest groups are airing ads you want to get out there, too."

<HEADLINE> Columbia Aid Package Scrutinized  </HEADLINE>
   By CESAR GARCIA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN, Colombia (AP) -- President Clinton's proposed $1.3
billion anti-narcotics aid package for Colombia will only lead to more
bloodshed, a leftist rebel spokesman warned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Interviewed in the rebel-held southern ranching town of San Vicente del
Caguan, Commander Ivan Rios called the massive aid infusion announced Tuesday a
``dangerous'' step that will escalate fighting without reducing the flow of
drugs to the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not the solution, but rather the worsening of the problem,'' said
Rios, a midlevel commander of the country's largest guerrilla band, the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.
</P>
<P>
	   In announcing the plan Tuesday to up U.S. aid to Colombia from $300 million
last year, Clinton said it will ``help Colombia promote peace and prosperity and
deepen its democracy.''
</P>
<P>
	   The money will go toward helping stem the production and export of illegal
narcotics while supporting economic development and improving human rights,
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The bulk of the aid will go toward special counternarcotics battalions in
the Colombian military, whose principal activity is battling the rebels. The
battalions will receive dozens of American-made helicopters for transporting
troops and drug surveillance.
</P>
<P>
	   The ranking Democrat on the U.S. Senate appropriations subcommittee that
oversees foreign spending said Wednesday that he wants the Clinton
administration to better explain what it hopes to achieve with the plan and at
what risk.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We at least need to see a concerted effort by the Colombian Army to thwart
the paramilitary groups, who are responsible for most of the atrocities against
civilians, and a willingness by the Colombian Armed Forces to turn over to the
civilian courts their own members who violate human rights,'' Sen. Patrick
Leahy, D-Vt., said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Trying to compel the Colombian rebels to negotiate by increasing
counterinsurgency efforts is ``a costly and dangerous policy,'' Leahy said.
</P>
<P>
	   While insisting that Washington is not getting involved in another
counterinsurgency war in Latin America, U.S. officials concede that their
anti-narcotics strategy now requires confronting the rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   Funds are also being provided to wean poor peasants away from planting coca
and poppy, the illegal crops used to make cocaine and heroin. The rebels, who
earn huge revenues by taxing the peasant growers, have pledged in peace talks to
participate in crop-substitution programs.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is scheduled to visit Colombia this
weekend to explain the aid package, which will be part of Clinton's fiscal 2001
budget.
</P>
<P>
	   Colombia's drug production has skyrocketed in the past few years despite
increased law enforcement efforts here -- primarily a U.S-backed program to help
police raid jungle drug laboratories and to fumigate illegal crops from the air.
</P>
<P>
	   Those efforts are destined to fail, U.S. officials contend, as long as the
15,000-member FARC retains its grip on the southern regions where drug crops are
growing the fastest. Police are outgunned by the rebels, who often fire on
fumigation planes.
</P>
<P>
	   Fighting narcotics has long been the focus of U.S. policy in Colombia, the
world's No. 1 source of cocaine and a growing heroin supplier.

   ANOKA, Minn. (AP) -- Morgan Grams, son of Sen. Rod Grams, R-Minn., was
appointed a public defender Wednesday during his arraignment on a misdemeanor
marijuana possession charge.
</P>
<P>
	   Morgan Grams, 21, did not enter a plea, which is considered the same as
pleading innocent. A pretrial hearing was set for Feb. 18.
</P>

jailed twice for drug-related offenses.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> USDA: Meat Labeling Could Cost  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Requiring meat to be labeled with the country of origin
could raise costs for consumers and there's no proof it would help U.S.
livestock producers, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   In a study requested by Congress, USDA said that mandatory labeling also
could hurt U.S. meat exports if foreign countries impose a similar requirement.
</P>
<P>
	   Some American producers have been pushing for such labeling as a way to curb
imports of Canadian cattle.
</P>
<P>
	   USDA did not put a price tag on a labeling law. The labels themselves could
cost anywhere from $500,000 to $8 million, depending on what cuts of meat the
law applied to. But processors also would have to segregate meat that enters the
country to make sure it's labeled properly, and the cost of doing that ``is
unknown, but could be significant,'' the report said. There would be additional
costs to USDA to enforce the law.
</P>
<P>
	   The department also concluded there is evidence that consumers are willing
to pay higher prices to know where the meat they are buying comes from.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To the contrary, if consumers do distinguish goods depending on their
country of origin, strong incentive exists for industries to act without
government intervention,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meatpackers claim that labeling meat could cost the industry $1 billion a
year. About 10 percent of the beef that Americans eat is imported.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Expels U.S. Zapatista Backer  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEJANDRO RUIZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) -- A Denver man who was ordered to
leave Mexico by Jan. 6 has remained in the country, battling an immigration
policy critics say is aimed at foreign supporters of leftist rebels in the
southern state of Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
	   A court on Tuesday issued an order suspending the government's effort to
expel Kerry Appel until federal immigration officials provide more evidence of
why he is being expelled.
</P>
<P>
	   Appel is one of hundreds of foreign supporters of the region's Zapatista
rebels who have been ordered out of Mexico over the past four years. He was
summoned Jan. 3 to immigration offices along with several other foreigners
suspected of violating their visas.
</P>
<P>
	   Though the government denies targeting Zapatista supporters, most of those
expelled were members of Zapatista support networks or human rights
organizations abroad. The government has also set up immigration checkpoints on
obscure country roads where the rebels have influence.
</P>
<P>
	   Appel advertises support for the Zapatistas on his Denver company's Web site
and has made documentary films supporting their cause. His small coffee company
says it sells beans purchased from pro-Zapatista peasants.
</P>
<P>
	   The government accuses expelled foreigners of violating terms of their visas
by meddling in politics. Some had worked directly with the Zapatistas -- though
none are known to have been involved in military activities -- and some were
simply caught in pro-Zapatista areas.
</P>
<P>
	   Appel says he was attending a Zapatista-sponsored New Year's celebration in
San Andres Larrainzar, a town north of San Cristobal de las Casas where the
Zapatistas have a strong presence.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this month, the country's top immigration official told a news
conference that ``foreigners are not prohibited from attending local
celebrations, but if the celebrations have a political connection, that's
interference'' in domestic politics and grounds for expulsion.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Mexican officials are never known to have expelled foreigners for
watching political rallies anywhere else in Mexico, or in other parts of
Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
	   The Zapatistas fought the government directly for two weeks at the start of
1994 before a cease-fire. Claiming to fight for democracy and Indian rights,
they have attracted widespread international support, thus irritating the
government.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Warns on Chinese Influence  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Pentagon intelligence report says a Chinese foothold
near the Panama Canal though a Hong Kong-based company ``could provide a conduit
for illegal shipments of technology or prohibited items from the West to
China.''
</P>
<P>
	   The newly declassified report, completed last October, says the presence of
the Hutchison-Whampoa firm at two port facilities in the area also could
facilitate the movement of arms and other prohibited items into the Americas.
</P>
<P>
	   The Washington public interest group Judicial Watch released the report
after obtaining it under the Freedom of Information Act.
</P>
<P>
	   The report came to light as Secretary of State Madeleine Albright planned a
visit Saturday to Panama, where she will confer with President Mireya Moscoso
and assess the transfer of the canal to local control, completed two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Many sections of the three-page report were heavily blacked out. Each of the
four pages was stamped ``SECRET'' but that classification was subsequently
replaced with a new stamp: ``UNCLASSIFIED.''
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about the report, the State Department reaffirmed its view that that
the Hong Kong company's operation of the port facilities ``does not pose a
threat to U.S. national security.''
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman said the government of Panama ``controls all navigation through
the Panama Canal. The Hong Kong company operation in Panama involves loading and
unloading cargo from its port facilities. This function is identical to that of
other cargo firms operating in the world.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Pentagon has issued similar statements about the situation.
</P>
<P>
	   The presence of Hutchison-Whampoa has been a continuing source of concern to
conservative members of Congress and some analysts because of its supposed links
to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said, referring to
the Panama Canal, that it would be illogical for China to ``pass up a chance to
acquire a major foothold in one of the world's three major choke points --
especially if it can be done with little cost or risk.''
</P>
<P>
	   According to the Pentagon study, first reported by the Washington Times,
``any potential threat posed by the presence of a pro-Chinese corporate entity
in the Panama Canal zone is indirect.'' It added that it is unlikely that the
Hutchison Whampoa subsidiary carrying out operations at the two ports ``would
overtly sabotage or damage the canal on orders from Beijing, as it would be
contrary to their own financial interests and would undoubtedly elicit an
immediate response from the U.S. and the international community.''
</P>
<P>
	   It added, however, that Hutchison Whampoa's owner, Hong Kong ``tycoon'' Li
Ka-Shing, has ``extensive business ties in Beijing and has compelling financial
reasons to maintain a good relationship with China's leadership.''

<HEADLINE> FCC Reassures Religious Broadcasters  </HEADLINE>
   By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's top broadcasting regulator defended his
agency Wednesday against claims that it is trying to restrict the content of the
programming religious broadcasters can air.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal Communications Commission Chairman Bill Kennard sought to clarify a
decision made by the FCC last month that has drawn fire from religious
broadcasters and a group of lawmakers who fear that regulators are trying to
suppress religious expression on television.
</P>
<P>
	   Kennard, in a letter to the lawmakers Wednesday, said the FCC was only
offering additional guidance that impacted a limited number of noncommercial
religious broadcasters who seek licenses for specially reserved educational
channels.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These standards, however, never operate to prohibit the airing of any
particular noncommercial programming, religious or otherwise,'' Kennard wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   He noted that in order to qualify for such special educational licenses,
broadcasters have always had to show that the channel is to be ``used primarily
to serve the educational needs of the community'' and for ``the advancement of
educational programs.''
</P>
<P>
	   In deciding a license transfer last month between a public television
affiliate and a religious TV station in Pittsburgh, the commission tightened its
definition of who qualified for these licenses.
</P>
<P>
	   The FCC determined that broadcasters must devote 50 percent of their
regularly scheduled air time to educational programs.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission also said that programming ``primarily devoted to religious
exhortation, proselytizing or statements of personally held religious views and
beliefs generally would not qualify as 'general educational' programming.'' In a
footnote, it said church services also normally would not qualify as ``general
educational'' programming.
</P>
<P>
	   That language prompted the National Religious Broadcasters to send a
stinging memo about the FCC to their membership.
</P>
<P>
	   Kennard stressed that the ruling does not apply to the majority of religious
broadcasters, who operate on commercial channels. For those who do seek special
educational station licenses, they only have to meet the requirement that 50
percent of their programming be educational, he added.
</P>
<P>
	   But the members of Congress who had decried the FCC ruling appeared unmoved
by Kennard's letter.
</P>
<P>
	   In a quickly fired response to the FCC chief Wednesday afternoon, the
lawmakers argued that the commission action still amounts to censorship of
religious expression.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The commission's guidance is designed to force religious broadcasters
seeking to hold a noncommercial television license to cut back on tradition
religious programming ... and replace it with FCC-approved educational
content,'' wrote Republican Reps. Michael Oxley of Ohio, Steve Largent of
Oklahoma, Chip Pickering of Mississippi and Cliff Stearns of Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, Oxley has drafted legislation to reverse the additional
guidance offered by the FCC.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know the FCC will try to put a good face on this action, but the simple
truth is the commission is restricting those who express faith,'' Oxley said.
The congressman said he would introduce the legislation when Congress returns at
the month's end.

<HEADLINE> Japan Pushed To Cut TeleCom Costs  </HEADLINE>
   By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Japanese proposals to reduce charges imposed on U.S. and
other foreign telecommunication companies do not go far enough in meeting
commitments Japan made in 1998, the Clinton administration said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Richard Fisher said so far Japan has
proposed little in the way of reductions in steep connection charges imposed on
U.S. companies and other foreign telecommunications firms seeking to compete
against Japan's Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Co.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are seeking assurances that they will implement what we agreed upon in
1998,'' Fisher told reporters. ``The benefits of what we are advocating are very
important to Japanese consumers and businesses.''
</P>
<P>
	   Japanese officials are scheduled to meet with Fisher next Tuesday in
Washington for a review of the 1998 telecommunications agreement, announced by
President Clinton and then-Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.
</P>
<P>
	   The major dispute concerns how Japan will implement pledges to cut hookup
charges that NTT imposes for rival telecommunication companies seeking to crack
Japan's vast telecommunications market.
</P>
<P>
	   Fisher said the proposals currently being discussed in Japan currently
represent ``little or no change'' in the current high charges.
</P>
<P>
	   ``NTT is a monopoly. It is trying to do everything it can to delay a
significant reduction in rates,'' Fisher said. He said the U.S. side will be
seeking specific details of what the government of Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi will propose to the Japanese Diet next month.
</P>
<P>
	   The telecommunications dispute is just one of a number of trade tensions
between the two nations currently as America's deficit with Japan has widened
considerably over the past two years in the wake of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   Other issues in dispute include promises Japan has made to reduce
regulations in its construction industry to make it easier for American
companies to compete for business in Japan.
</P>
<P>
	   Fisher said the two countries would meet next month for an overall review of
the deregulation effort launched in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Those talks, known as the Enhanced Initiative on Deregulation and
Competition Policy, seek to cut Japanese regulations and increase foreign
competition in such areas as housing, retailing, energy and construction
standards as a way of boosting U.S. exports and narrowing the trade deficit.

<HEADLINE> CBS Skewered on Digital Insertion  </HEADLINE>
    By HANNAH WOLFSON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS News is facing criticism for something that wasn't
really there.
</P>
<P>
	   Network executives said they did nothing wrong when they used digital
technology to paste a CBS logo over an NBC screen and another advertisement in
Times Square during live broadcasts of "CBS Evening News" on Dec. 30 and Dec.
31.
</P>
<P>
	   But some media observers say the network may have sacrificed journalistic
ethics for the sake of business.
</P>
<P>
	   Although digital imaging is often used to insert virtual billboards during
sports broadcasts and other images is entertainment programs, its use in a news
program has come under fire.
</P>
<P>
	   "This may seem like an innocent little corporate coup, but there are bigger
implications in terms of eroding people's confidence in what they see on the
screen," said Richard T. Kaplar, vice president of The Media Institute, a
nonprofit think tank in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   CBS News President Andrew Heyward said the decision to use the digital
imaging during the competitive millennium news broadcast triggered internal
debate.
</P>
<P>
	   "Reasonable people could disagree whether it is an appropriate use of
digital technology," Heyward said, "and like any new technology it poses new
issues we have to address on a case-by-case basis."
</P>
<P>
	   CBS's morning program, "The Early Show," routinely uses the technology to
digitally paste a CBS advertisement on the General Motors building in New York,
where it is taped. But like the other network morning programs, it is generally
considered entertainment.
</P>
<P>
	   Heyward said CBS has a "core principle" of not deceiving the audience, and
he doesn't believe the imaging violated that principle any more than the
standard use of printed graphics on the television screen.
</P>
<P>
	   Aly Colon of The Poynter Institute for Media Studies in St. Petersburg,
Fla., said such practices can hurt news broadcasters' credibility.
</P>
<P>
	   "If what's behind (the anchor) is not accurate or real, then is what he is
saying or where he is or what he's trying to convey any more authentic than the
environment he's in?" Colon asked.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC provoked a similar controversy in 1994 when Washington correspondent
Cokie Roberts was introduced as reporting from the Capitol when she was actually
standing in the studio in front of an image of Capitol Hill. She even wore her
coat for authenticity.
</P>
<P>
	   "It should never have happened, and you won't see that happening again," ABC
News spokeswoman Eileen Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
	   While ABC uses digital imaging to create graphics for Monday Night Football
and other sports programs, Murphy said credibility in the eyes of viewers is too
important to do the same with the news, Such a practice would be manipulative,
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   NBC said it has never used digital imaging during its nightly newscasts and
has no plans to do so.
</P>
<P>
	   Digital manipulation is not limited to television. Time magazine apologized
to readers in 1994 for featuring a darkened version of O.J. Simpson's mug shot
on its cover. And many newspapers have policies against the use of
digitally-enhanced photos.
</P>
<P>
	   But with such technology evolving quickly, Colon said, most news
organizations' walls between journalism and business may need some updating.
</P>
<P>
	   "You have to think about why those walls are there and if you're going to
vault over them, what that implies," Colon said. "I think that it's going to be
a very challenging element that the news industry will have to address in terms
of who's going to be responsible for the news."

<HEADLINE> Polls: Send Cuban Boy Home  </HEADLINE>
   By WILL LESTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than half of Americans approve of the federal
decision to send 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez who was found clinging to an inner
tube off the coast of Florida back to Cuba to be with his father, two new polls
say.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal officials say he should be returned to his father, but a Florida
judge has said he cannot be returned until a March hearing. Attorney General
Janet Reno said Wednesday that only a federal court can make such a ruling,
leaving the case in legal limbo.
</P>
<P>
	   The percentage of Americans who wanted the boy returned has increased
slightly in polls by ABC News and CNN-USA Today-Gallup. In polls taken in
December, just under half wanted him returned.
</P>
<P>
	   The ABC poll indicated that 52 percent favored the boy's return to Cuba,
while 36 percent thought he should stay here. Just under half, 46 percent,
wanted to see him returned last month, while a third thought he should stay.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The changes were not huge, but we had fewer who were undecided this
time,'' said ABC pollster Gary Langer. ``The issue has been getting a lot of
attention. More people have information on it.''
</P>
<P>
	   A CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll found that 56 percent approve of the boy's
return while 36 percent thought he should stay. Last month, people were about
evenly split, but the decision by the U.S. government decision to return him to
his father in Cuba may have increased the number who support that move, said
Lydia Saad, managing editor of the Gallup Poll.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Public opinion can be altered by an official decision,'' she said.
``There's a degree of authority to the decision -- particularly on an issue
where the public did not have strong opinions.''
</P>
<P>
	   Men supported the boy's return to his father in Cuba by a slightly larger
margin than women, and people with college educations were more likely than
those with less education to favor his return.
</P>
<P>
	   A WLTV-Channel 23 poll of Miami-Dade County residents in southern Florida
indicated that nine of 10 Hispanics oppose his return to Cuba, while a majority
of non-Hispanic whites and blacks say he should go home.
</P>
<P>
	   The ABC poll of 1,016 adults was conducted Jan. 5-9. The CNN-USA
Today-Gallup poll of 1,633 adults was taken Friday through Monday. Both polls
have error margins of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Iraq: U.N. Resolution 'Difficult'  </HEADLINE>
   By AHMAD SAMI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraq would find it hard to accept or implement a new
U.N. Security Council plan to restart disarmament activities in the country, a
senior Iraqi official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   But Deputy Foreign Minister Nizar Hamdoon did not rule out cooperation with
the United Nations in carrying out the plan if ``the situation changes and there
are new elements.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Iraq finds it very difficult to deal with this resolution ... as it exists
right now,'' Hamdoon, Iraq's former U.N. ambassador, told Associated Press
Television News. He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dec. 17 resolution calls for the creation of a new international
inspection agency, which would resume the disarmament of all Iraq's remaining
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
	   Until Iraq is certified to be free of illegal weapons, the U.N. Security
Council will not lift the economic sanctions imposed in 1990 after Iraq invaded
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
	   The resolution promises to consider suspending sanctions for renewable
four-month periods if Iraq cooperates with the new inspectors and makes progress
toward answering questions about its disarmament.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. chief Kofi Annan asked the five permanent members of the Security
Council to consider Swedish diplomat Rolf Ekeus to head the new U.N. Monitoring,
Verification and Inspection Commission, known as UNMOVIC, U.N. diplomats said
Tuesday in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   UNMOVIC replaces the U.N. Special Commission, or UNSCOM, which was
responsible since the end of the 1991 Persian Gulf War for eliminating Iraq's
programs for weapons of mass destruction. Ekeus was executive director of UNSCOM
before he left in 1997 to become Sweden's ambassador to the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   UNSCOM pulled out of Iraq in December 1998 just before the United States and
Britain launched airstrikes to retaliate for Iraq's alleged obstruction of
UNSCOM inspectors.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, a state-run newspaper quoted Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed
al-Sahhaf as saying Baghdad may eventually accept the UNMOVIC resolution if the
Security Council introduced some amendments.

<HEADLINE> Continental Warns on 1999 Earnings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    HOUSTON (AP) -- Continental Airlines announced Wednesday that its 1999
earnings, due out next week, will be reduced by $21 million because of
accounting changes made during the year.
</P>
<P>
	   The Houston-based carrier said it has revamped the way it accounts for the
sale of mileage credits in its OnePass frequent-flyer program. Retroactive to
Jan. 1, 1999, revenue from the sale of mileage credits will be deferred and
recognized only when transportation is provided.
</P>
<P>
	   Continental, the nation's fifth-largest carrier, said other asset sales,
including a portion of its interest in Equant N.V., will cause a net gain of $6
million in the fourth quarter results, due out Jan. 18.
</P>
<P>
	   The company had previously announced several non-recurring items in the
fourth quarter, including a $182 million after-tax gain from the sale of its
interest in Amadeus Global Travel Distribution S.A. and a $50 million after-tax
charge for the early retirement of several DC-10-30 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
	   Continental reported earnings of $358 million for the first nine months of
last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The earnings warning was issued after close of financial markets. In trading
Wednesday, Continental shares fell 12 1/2 cents to $44 at 5 p.m. EST on the New
York Stock Exchange.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Police have captured a man accused of participating
in the drive-by killing last August of a beloved radio and television humorist,
authorities said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The suspect, identified as 22-year-old Juan Pablo Ortiz, was arrested last
weekend in Medellin, Colombia's second-largest city. He is being kept under
tight security.
</P>
<P>
	   Ortiz has been identified by witnesses but has not confessed, chief
prosecutor Alfonso Gomez said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Gomez gave no indication that authorities were closer to knowing the motive
for the killing or if Ortiz -- a reputed professional hit man -- had been hired
to kill him.
</P>
<P>
	   Jaime Garzon made a career of lampooning leading figures in Colombian
politics, sports and entertainment on television and radio. He was widely
admired for helping Colombians laugh despite their country's seemingly endless
violence. The assassination caused a national outpouring of grief.
</P>
<P>
	   The 39-year-old satirist died Aug. 13, when men on passing motorcycles
sprayed his jeep with bullets as Garzon drove to his morning job at a Bogota
radio station.
</P>
<P>
	   Speculation about who ordered the killing abounds in Colombia's media, with
possible suspects ranging from leftist rebels to rightist paramilitary gunmen to
an ultraright faction in the military.
</P>
<P>
	   Garzon had discreetly helped mediate the release of hostages by the
guerrillas and was periodically accused of having leftist sympathies.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Cancels Communications Licenses  </HEADLINE>
   By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Valuable communications licenses held by a bankrupt
company have been canceled and will be reauctioned, the government told a
bankruptcy court Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Communications Commission, in a filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy
Court for the Southern District of New York, objected to plans by NextWave
Telecom to reorganize itself in bankruptcy court in the hopes of using its
licenses to build a wireless network.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, the commission said the licenses had automatically been canceled,
per FCC rules, and that it would seek new bidders for those slices of the
airwaves -- potentially worth billions of dollars -- in July.
</P>
<P>
	   FCC Chairman Bill Kennard, citing a decision from the appeals court that
confirmed the commission's authority over the licenses, said the agency's rules
dictate that such licenses cancel when their holder fails to pay for them on
time.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Allowing a company to keep its licenses despite its failure to pay on time
would be unfair to others who have played by the rules and would undermine the
integrity of our auctions process,'' Kennard said.
</P>
<P>
	   He added that the commission is anxious to put that portion of the airwaves
to use for consumers by auctioning it to another owner.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This spectrum has laid fallow for too long,'' Kennard said.
</P>
<P>
	   The problem of communication companies holding licenses and going bankrupt
has proved a major headache for regulators, who have unsuccessfully sought
legislation to ensure that licenses won at auction are not tied up in bankruptcy
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
	   NextWave, based in Hawthorne, N.Y., won its wireless licenses in a federal
auction several years ago, to use for the next generation of wireless
communications, known as PCS.
</P>
<P>
	   But then the company couldn't raise enough money to pay the $4.7 billion it
had bid for the licenses. The other two top bidders in that auction were also
unable to pay the FCC and filed for Chapter 11, tying up the licenses in
bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
	   A bankruptcy court in New York ruled last year that the company could hold
on to the licenses after paying just a portion of the amount they bid. But the
Second Circuit court in late fall reversed that decision and reaffirmed the
FCC's jurisdiction over the licenses.
</P>
<P>
	   In light of the ruling, the commission filed its petition with the appeals
court stating that the licenses had automatically been canceled and therefore,
any attempts by the company to reorganize itself should not be approved.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, a group of investors including Global Crossing and Liberty
Media, an affiliate of AT&AMP;T, agreed to provide $1.6 billion in cash to help
NextWave emerge from bankruptcy court and build a wireless network.
</P>
<P>
	   That process, however, could take much longer than re-auctioning the
licenses to an existing wireless operator. One potential bidder for the new
licenses is mobile phone company Nextel Communications.
</P>
<P>
	   The licenses include some major metropolitan markets such as New York,
Seattle, Philadelphia and San Francisco.

<HEADLINE> Teen-agers used cyberscam to get credit card numbers, buy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   GALLOWAY TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - Four teen-age boys have been charged in
what police say was an Internet scam that used credit card numbers to defraud
hundreds of people around the country.
<P>
	   The teen-agers, ages 14 to 16, obtained credit card numbers by tricking
America Online and Earthlink subscribers into downloading files via the
Internet, according to Detective Jay Davies.
</P>
<P>
	   The files allowed the teen-agers to obtain the passwords, addresses, phone
numbers and credit card numbers of people in New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania,
Ohio, Florida, Nebraska, Texas and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
	   The alleged cyber scammers then used the credit card numbers to make about
$8,000 in purchases, arranging to have the merchandise delivered to unoccupied
homes, according to Davies.
</P>
<P>
	   In some of the cases, the teen-agers posed online as representatives of
America Online and e-mailed subscribers, telling them their account information
had been lost and that they had to provide it again.
</P>
<P>
	   "They call it 'carding,"' Davies said. "They also don't feel as if there are
any real victims because they're thousands of miles away and because they don't
have to stick a gun in some people's faces to get it."
</P>
<P>
	   The teen-agers, whose names weren't released, are all students at Absegami
High School.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're very average kids, from regular homes. With the exception of one,
I've never run into any of them before," Davies said.
</P>
<P>
	   The boys were arrested between Dec. 23 and Jan. 6 and charged with numerous
counts of fraud, conspiracy, credit card theft, theft of services, receiving
stolen property and other charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the victims was John Steinmetz, 79, of Northfield. He got suspicious
when a pair of snowboarding pants were delivered to his house and a company
called him seeking to verify his purchase of a paintball gun.
</P>
<P>
	   It wasn't clear why the pants were sent to Steinmetz's home. In other cases,
the merchandise arrived at the unoccupied homes - where the boys sometimes left
notes directing delivery services to leave the merchandise - and the boys picked
up the items later.
</P>
<P>
	   Police were alerted when John Bertino of Galloway Township complained to
them that charges for $1,000 in "kids stuff" - including a Sony Playstation -
had shown up on his Visa credit card.
</P>
<P>
	   Only about $2,500 worth of merchandise was actually received by the
teen-agers. It was seized by police in searches of their homes, as was $8,000
worth of computer equipment owned by the boys. The Atlantic County Prosecutor's
Office plans to examine the hard drives of the boys' computers to seek evidence
of more crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   Computer users - especially those who shop on-line - should beware of such
scams, Davies said.
</P>
<P>
	   "People need to be careful about who they give their credit card information
out to. Internet service providers don't ask for this information. You shouldn't
give credit card information to anyone who seeks it unsolicited," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   America Online spokesman Rich D'Amato sounded a similar warning.
</P>
<P>
	   "In the online world, just as in the off-line world, there are people whose
intentions are less than honest," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   For that reason, America Online warns subscribers on its service against
giving out their passwords or other sensitive information. AOL staffers will
never ask a subscriber for a password or billing information, he said. The
service also maintains a "neighborhood watch" site that outlines how members can
protect their passwords and avoid being scammed, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Never download an attachment that arrives to you in e-mail from someone you
don't know," D'Amato said.

<HEADLINE> Blaze Disrupts Caribbean Cruise  </HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW J. ROSENBERG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MONTEGO BAY, Jamaica (AP) -- Their vacations cut short by a cruise ship
fire, hundreds of disappointed passengers crowded a Jamaican airport for charter
flights home Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Carnival Cruise Lines' Celebration was about 100 miles from Jamaica when the
fire broke out, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Janna Vic.
</P>
<P>
	   The blaze in an auxiliary generator started around midnight and was put out
within minutes by automated firefighting equipment, said Carnival spokesman Andy
Newman. There are three auxiliary generators, all located in the middle of the
733-foot ship, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   None of the ship's 1,586 passengers and 667 crew members was injured.
</P>
<P>
	   Celebration pulled into port at Montego Bay on Wednesday afternoon. The ship
left New Orleans on Sunday for a seven-day cruise with planned stops in Montego
Bay, Grand Cayman Island and Cozumel, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of the fire, the passengers will be flown back to New Orleans or to
their hometowns, Newman said. Passengers will get full refunds and a free
seven-day cruise.
</P>
<P>
	   Many people waiting for flights at the Montego Bay airport said they were
frustrated at losing their vacations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've taken nine cruises -- this is our first with Carnival and we won't
be taking another one,'' said Peter Bogner of Eureka Springs, Ark.
</P>
<P>
	   After the fire, the ship drifted for about six hours and was temporarily
without running water, toilets or air conditioning, Newman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Carnival canceled Celebration's Saturday voyage from New Orleans. Passengers
scheduled for that trip will receive a full refund and a 50 percent discount on
a future Carnival cruise.

<HEADLINE> NJ gets A for funding, D-plus for teacher development in survey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - An annual survey by a national education magazine
this year gives New Jersey near failing grades on improving teacher quality.
<P>
	   But a state education spokesman said the information Education Week used to
craft a "D-plus" on teacher development is outdated and inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey fared better in the annual Quality Counts survey on education
funding and curriculum standards, receiving "A" and "B-minus" grades
respectively.
</P>
<P>
	   But it garnered incomplete grades for student achievement and "school
climate." Too few students took a voluntary national test to provide a large
enough sample for the report card, which uses the test results to measure both
students' scholastic performance and their attitudes toward school.
</P>
<P>
	   This year's fourth annual survey, dubbed Quality Counts 2000, highlighted
national efforts to improve the quality of the teaching profession. Overall, the
50 states deserve a "C," magazine editors said.
</P>
<P>
	   For instance, the survey found that while 39 states require prospective
teachers to pass basic literacy and mathematics tests, 36 of those states let
some who fail slip through loopholes.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey's recent push toward professional development is too little, too
late, according the magazine.
</P>
<P>
	   But state spokesman Peter Peretzman disputed Education Week's findings.
</P>
<P>
	   "They used a flawed and subjective grading system that failed to take into
account numerous teacher quality programs put in place by the administration,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Those include continuing education programs that require teachers to take
100 hours of professional development courses every five years, a new teacher
recruitment program and higher college grade point averages for starting
teachers. In addition, Gov. Christie Whitman unveiled a new teacher mentoring
program in her State of the State address earlier this week, he noted.
</P>
<P>
	   Karen Joseph, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Education Association, agreed
that New Jersey is answering critics.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would anticipate that when Education Week revisits this subject and they
acknowledge the existence of our professional development program, coupled with
the mentoring program, next year New Jersey should get an 'A'," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Allen, a policy analyst for the Denver-based Education Commission of
the States, a bipartisan education think tank not associated with the magazine,
said states often complain about low survey grades. But the report card is meant
to hold states up to higher standards, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said New Jersey ought to do a better job certifying teachers' performance
throughout their careers. The state should also put teeth in its professional
development plan instead of leaving enforcement up to local districts, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Peretzman said the state is proud of its No. 1 ranking in the total amount
of money spent per pupil, $8,801 in dollars adjusted for regional cost
differences, according to the magazine. The state was previously ranked near the
bottom of the 50 states in terms of dollars spent in the classroom, but has
finally pulled itself up into the middle of the pack, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But a spokesman for the New Jersey School Boards Association said he is
troubled by the state's lower grade in resource allocation. In that category,
the state earned only a "C-minus."
</P>
<P>
	   "That signals that there are still too many districts that have to overtax
themselves," said spokesman Frank Belluscio.

<HEADLINE> Coalition Leader To Be Croat Premier  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- The senior leader of a center-left coalition that won
Croatia's parliamentary elections will be appointed prime minister, the
country's acting president said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Vlatko Pavletic, the parliament speaker who is temporarily replacing the
late President Franjo Tudjman, told state-run radio that he will charge Ivica
Racan, the leader of the Social Democratic Party, with forming a new government
on Jan. 22.
</P>
<P>
	   Racan's party defeated the ruling Croatian Democratic Union in alliance with
their junior partners, the Social Liberal Party, in parliamentary elections on
Jan. 3, ending the ruling party's almost decade-long grip on power.
</P>
<P>
	   Racan's appointment would have been made earlier had election officials not
determined minor irregularities in about a dozen of the 6,000 polling stations.
</P>
<P>
	   Although a repeat of the vote in those areas on Sunday cannot significantly
alter the election outcome, the Constitution forbids the appointment of a
premier until official final results are declared.

<HEADLINE> Texas Kills 200th Inmate Since '82  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A man who strangled a woman and child who lived
next door to him was put to death Wednesday, the 200th execution in Texas since
capital punishment resumed in the state in 1982.
</P>
<P>
	   Earl Carl Heiselbetz Jr., 48, was executed by injection for the 1991
killings of Rena Rogers and her 2-year-old daughter, Jacy.
</P>
<P>
	   Strapped to a gurney before the execution began, Heiselbetz looked at his
mother and father, who were watching through a window nearby, and said: ``Love
y'all. See you on the other side.''
</P>
<P>
	   Heiselbetz had said he could not remember killing the woman and child, who
were his closest neighbors in a secluded area near the Sabine National Forest in
east Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Rogers and her daughter disappeared after returning home from a
midmorning trip to the grocery store. Their remains were found a month later in
a barn.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors said Heiselbetz confessed after the bodies were found. They said
Heiselbetz, an unemployed truck driver, had gone over to the Rogers house to
make 1-900 calls for a sweepstakes and might have been caught there when the
woman and her daughter came home.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas leads all states in executions since the Supreme Court allowed the
death penalty to resume in 1976. Virginia is second with 72.

<HEADLINE> Former State Sen. Associate Pleads  </HEADLINE>
   By KELLY P. KISSEL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LITTLE ROCK (AP) -- A politically connected lawyer pleaded guilty to
conspiracy Wednesday, detailing cronyism in a federally backed welfare program
that prosecutors say netted a former state senator nearly $1 million for no
work.
</P>
<P>
	   By pleading guilty and agreeing to testify against his colleagues, Murrey L.
Grider escaped 35 other counts and won a promise from the federal government
that it would not prosecute his son on 12 related charges. His son, accused of
netting $73,000 in the scheme, could have faced 75 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Sentencing for Grider was postponed to a later date.
</P>
<P>
	   His agreement to testify boosts the government's case against former state
Sen. Nick Wilson, a former law partner accused of being the kingpin of a
wide-ranging public corruption ring. Wilson and seven others face trial on a
133-count indictment Feb. 28.
</P>
<P>
	   Grider, 56, said Wilson hand-picked lawyers for a scheme to defraud federal
welfare officials through state-run programs. Grider said he knew about
kickbacks but did nothing to stop them.
</P>
<P>
	   In a five-minute summary before U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr.,
Grider incriminated Wilson, saying the once-powerful state senator hired the
lawyers and arranged the kickbacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Johnson said Grider kicked back $618,610 to
Wilson. With kickbacks from other lawyers, ``Wilson received $984,844 for
performing no service,'' Johnson said. The figure is 67 percent of the amount
that Arkansas received for the child support program from 1993 to 1997, when the
alleged crimes occurred, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Wilson, 57, who resigned from the Legislature on Dec. 31, could not be
reached for comment. Home and office numbers listed for him have been
disconnected.
</P>
<P>
	   Wilson was convicted in November of conspiracy and tax evasion.

<HEADLINE> White House Earmarks Cancer Money  </HEADLINE>
   By KAREN GULLO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House wants to spend $27 million to develop
blood tests for measuring toxic substances in humans. The money also would be
used to help communities use the tests to investigate unusually high cancer
rates or chemical accidents.
</P>
<P>
	   The funds, to be included in President Clinton's 2001 budget, would more
than double what the government spent last year to develop ways of measuring
toxic exposure in humans. Officials say the tests are needed to study the link
between chemicals and disease and to identify regions of the country where
Americans are exposed cancer-causing substances.
</P>
<P>
	   If funds are approved by Congress, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention plan to test thousands of people and make the tests available to
state and local health officials, said Dr. Jeffrey Koplan, CDC director.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have currently in a more experimental mode tests for a wide variety of
toxins in the human body,'' said Koplan. ``This will move the capability of
doing these tests out into the community.''
</P>
<P>
	   The tests could be used in studies of so-called cancer clusters -- places
where a higher-than-normal numbers of people who live or work in the same place
come down with cancer. The tests could also be used to measure toxic exposures
from chemical spills or accidents.
</P>
<P>
	   The CDC's Environmental Health Lab, which develops such tests, has already
conducted studies that link pesticide exposure to breast cancer and PCBs to
non-Hodgkins lymphoma. It also does a national survey that tracks lead exposure
in children.
</P>
<P>
	   But the CDC wants to develop tests that can withstand the rigors of field
work so that communities can routinely monitor people for exposure to over 100
potentially toxic substances and, in the case of chemical accidents, quickly
determine whether people were exposed to dangerous poisons.
</P>
<P>
	   Right now there are few tests for measuring a wide variety of toxic
chemicals in humans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The lab is developing ways to look for dozens or hundreds of chemicals in
just a teaspoon of blood,'' said Dr. Richard Jackson, director of the CDC's
center for environmental health. ``The CDC wants to take them from the research
lab to the country health officer who is dealing with a cancer cluster or a
toxic spill.''

<HEADLINE> Seven Scottish Fisherman Feared Dead  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKUDBRIGHT, Scotland (AP) -- Seven Scottish fisherman were feared dead
Wednesday after their boat sank in the Irish Sea.
</P>
<P>
	   The 70-foot scallop dredger Solway Harvester disappeared after putting out a
distress call at about 6 p.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The coast guard said sonar detected the vessel at the bottom of the sea
Wednesday afternoon, close to where it had put out a distress call, off the Isle
of Man. Both its life rafts were discovered uninflated, prompting speculation
the dredger had sunk rapidly.
</P>
<P>
	   Coast guard officials said there was little hope of finding the crew, and
the sea and air search was scaled down Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair offered condolences to the families of the
fishermen, who ranged in age from 17 to 33.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our profound sympathy is with them all,'' Blair said.
</P>
<P>
	   Local police Sgt. Mike Kneeshaw said the southwest Scottish communities of
Whithorn, Garlieston and Isle of Whithorn were hard hit by the loss.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is a very tight-knit community,'' he said. ``There can be very, very
few families which will not be affected by this tragedy.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Won't Mediate Russian Conflict  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration ruled out a role for the United
States in mediation between Russia and the rebels in Chechnya, and suggested
Europeans could take on the job.
</P>
<P>
	   But as Russian forces resumed an offensive in the republic Wednesday, there
was no indication Moscow would heed U.S. advice that it seek a political
solution to a threatened secession by negotiating with Chechen leaders,
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't believe that the result of the use of force is going to be the
melting away of resistance,'' the State Department spokesman James P. Rubin
said. ``We believe that the Russians are in a cul-de-sac, that they cannot by
their current strategy come to the end of road because there is no end to this
kind of fighting.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the start of a visit to Washington Wednesday night, Iliyas Ahmadov, who
acts as foreign minister in the Chechen government, said he was not seeking U.S.
help or mediation, but only understanding of the Chechen cause. He planned
meetings with members of Congress and others.
</P>
<P>
	   ``God forbid, I don't want the United States to bomb Russia or give us
weapons,'' Ahmadov said. His remarks at an academic institute forum were
translated from Russian.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The only aim of our government is to stop the total destruction of our
people, and we are prepared to do anything,'' he said. ``We are prepared to
negotiate.''
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the State Department is asking Russia for clarification of
reports that Chechen males between ages 18 and 60, would be detained to see
whether they had ties to rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is essential that Russia respect the fundamental human rights of
civilians in and around Chechnya., not endanger the lives of noncombatants, and
ensure freedom of movement for displaced persons,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ahmadov said he appreciated the State Department's concern but more
important would be its reaction once it hears from Russia.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Wife Criticizes Peruvian Leader  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori's former wife is pulling no
punches as an opposition candidate for Congress, taking direct aim at her
ex-husband.
</P>
<P>
	   Susana Higuchi said in comments published Wednesday in the opposition
newspaper La Republica that if her husband returns to power for another
five-year term, it ``would bring more corruption, recession, more poverty, and
unemployment.''
</P>
<P>
	   The former first lady announced Monday that she would run for Congress,
ending supporters' hopes that she would challenge Fujimori for the presidency in
general elections in April.
</P>
<P>
	   She said her party, the Independent Moralizing Front, decided against
selecting a presidential candidate as an act of protest against Fujimori's
decision to seek a third consecutive term. Opinion polls indicate Fujimori has a
wide lead over his rival candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   Posing with a broom on the front page of Wednesday's La Republica, Higuchi
was pictured sweeping scraps of paper with ``recession,'' ``injustice,'' and
``dictator'' written in red block letters.
</P>
<P>
	   The couple's marital problems became public in 1994, after Fujimori's
supporters in Congress passed a law prohibiting the president's immediate family
members from running for national office. Many Peruvians believed the
legislation was tailored to thwart Higuchi's bid to challenge her husband in the
1995 presidential race, which Fujimori won.
</P>
<P>
	   When Higuchi accused Fujimori of tolerating widespread corruption in his
government and ignoring the needs of Peru's poor, he stripped her of her
ceremonial title of first lady, locked her out of the palace and soon after
filed for divorce. The divorce was completed in 1996, removing the prohibition
against a Higuchi candidacy.

<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Quipping that she finally agreed to take the hot seat
next to David Letterman because she "lost a bet with Tipper," a nervous Hillary
Rodham Clinton appeared a pretty good match for the late-night host on
Wednesday.
<P>
	   The first lady made her first visit to the Late Show, a stop that followed
weeks of the host taking pot shots at Mrs. Clinton over her plan to run for U.S.
Senate in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Confronted with the first lady in the flesh, Letterman at first set aside
his trademark sarcasm and lobbed her a softball, asking her to "tell us about
yourself."
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton smirked and told Letterman she grew up in the Midwest - as he
did - has a mother named Dorothy - as he does - and just couldn't resist the
temptation to follow him to New York.

<HEADLINE> Government: Let Whistles Blow  </HEADLINE>
   By DEB RIECHMANN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Train whistles -- nostalgic to some, a noisy nuisance to
others -- are being silenced at the expense of lives, federal regulators said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   They want nearly 250 communities that have banned whistles to let the
warnings sound once more if other steps aren't taken to improve safety at those
railroad crossings.
</P>
<P>
	   There were 431 deaths and more than 1,300 injuries in highway-rail crossing
accidents in 1998, the Federal Railroad Administration said Wednesday in
proposing a rule requiring train horns to be sounded at all public crossings.
</P>
<P>
	   When train horns are silenced at crossings with lights and gates, the
collision rate jumps 62 percent, said FRA Administrator Jolene Molitoris.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is really about life and death and how we can prevent truly preventable
injuries and deaths,'' Molitoris said. ``That's our goal.''
</P>
<P>
	   Train horns -- two long blasts followed by one short and one long -- are
standard practice at most of the 158,000 public railroad crossings across
America. But there are about 2,200 railroad crossings in 247 communities that
have enacted local bans prohibiting trains from sounding their horns.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the proposal, horns could be silenced only if other steps to improve
safety are taken in such ``quiet zones.'' At a minimum, all have to have gates
and lights. Additional steps that localities could take to get quiet zones
approved under the rule include installing cameras to catch violators or adding
extra gates or lane dividers to keep motorists from zigzagging around gates.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That S-move is well known where people try to beat trains where there's
only two gates,'' Molitoris said.
</P>
<P>
	   Localities can apply for federal and state grants and loans to help pay for
improvements needed to qualify as quiet zones, she said. The rule also proposes
an upper volume limit for train horns.
</P>
<P>
	   Public hearings on the issue will be held this spring in Ohio,
Massachusetts, Florida, Oregon, California, the District of Columbia, Indiana
and Illinois, where critics already are voicing opposition.
</P>
<P>
	   Noisy train whistles would affect the quality of life -- not to mention
property values -- in the Chicago suburb of Arlington Heights where developers
are spending millions of dollars to build housing near commuter rail lines,
Mayor Arlene Mulder said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I understand safety, but whistle blowing in and of itself will not
guarantee safety,'' she said. ``The real threat is to quality of life. We've
been working so hard to rebuild and revitalize downtown, and now they say
they're going to blow whistles?''
</P>
<P>
	   Leroy Jones, national legislative representative for the Brotherhood of
Locomotive Engineers, said urban sprawl, increased train traffic and Americans'
hurry-up approach to life have heightened the problem.
</P>
<P>
	   Jones, a former engineer, said blowing train horns would reduce deaths and
injuries from crossing collisions, which totaled 3,508 in 1998 -- the most
recent figures available.
</P>
<P>
	   On a bright December morning in 1978, two farmers in a pickup truck drove in
front of Jones' train traveling through Rose, Kan. The driver was thrown from
the truck and killed. The passenger died in Jones' arms.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I blew the horn. I put the train's emergency brakes on. The engine T-boned
the truck,'' Jones said. ``I had trouble sleeping. I had nightmares like four or
five months afterwards.''
</P>
<P>
	   Noisy train horns, however, have been too much to take for some residents in
Elkhart, Ind., east of South Bend. Gary Gilot, public works and utilities
director, said his city has petitioned state officials to prevent engineers from
blowing horns at 11 of 38 crossings in the community, which is home to a large
rail yard.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At some of these crossings there's like 85 trains a day. The long blasts
have gotten some people upset. They understand it in rural areas where they
don't have gates, but don't think they're needed where there's gated
crossings,'' Gilot said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One of the business leaders calculated how many horn blasts we had been
subjected to every day. It was astronomical.''
</P>
<P>
	   The FRA will accept public comment on the proposal through May 26, and
officials don't expect to finalize the regulation until 2001.

<HEADLINE> GOP Showcases Its Web Presence  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- National Republicans showcased new technology
Wednesday that will boost its presence on the Internet and possibly energize its
activists.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, the Republican National Committee becomes an Internet service
provider, offering direct access to the Net. The service will come with
customized Web pages providing updates on GOP developments, e-mail, chat rooms,
an ``anti-smut filter'' and ``unbiased reporting.''
</P>
<P>
	   An advertisement says the service targets ``people who want freedom FROM the
press.''
</P>
<P>
	   The RNC also began a separate service Wednesday that will let Web users
track Republican events nationally and in their neighborhoods. The service,
GOPlanit, is a calendar that also will alert users to nonpolitical events of
interest to them, and allows them to log personal events.
</P>
<P>
	   The Internet initiatives are part of an effort begun several months ago by
RNC Chairman Jim Nicholson to more aggressively use the Internet to promote the
party.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have recognized over the last 120 days that it's a new world where you
are digital or die,'' Nicholson said in opening the RNC's winter meeting here.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are trying to enhance participation in the political process,'' he
said. ``This gives us a wonderful capability ... to really stimulate people, and
to communicate with them without going through the filter of the news media.''
</P>
<P>
	   The party also announced that its national convention in Philadelphia in
August will be the first such political gathering broadcast in high-definition
television, which delivers substantially crisper images than traditional TV.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats also are using technology to spread their message.
</P>
<P>
	   The Democratic National Committee recently created a ``George W. Bush Stump
Speech Search Engine'' to underscore its contention that Bush falls back on his
standard address when pressed on almost any subject. By entering phrases from a
Bush appearance, users can count how many times he has used the statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The party will broadcast its national convention on the Web, as it did in
1996, and is considering an HDTV transmission, said Jenny Backus, a party
spokeswoman.

	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Donna
Shalala and Gov. Jeanne Shaheen praised Vice President Al Gore's health care
plan Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The pair toured Child Health Services, which provides health care and other
help to low-income families, before describing why they believe Gore's plan to
expand insurance coverage to all children is good for New Hampshire and the
country.
</P>
<P>
	   Shaheen said the plan fits with New Hampshire's history of building on
successful programs instead of making radical changes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think Al Gore's approach to health care is reasoned, it builds on what
we know already works and provides changes where needed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Shalala criticized Bill Bradley, Gore's rival for the Democratic
presidential nomination, for proposing to eliminate Medicaid and to give people
subsidies to buy health insurance or opt into the system that covers federal
employees.
</P>
<P>
	   She said that approach would hurt the disabled and others who depend on
Medicaid programs tailored to their needs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is a fundamental difference between giving people money to go out
and buy health insurance and making sure quality health care plans are
available,'' she said.

	   PHOENIX (AP) -- Former first lady Barbara Bush on Wednesday submitted the
forms that her son, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, needs to run in the Arizona
Republican presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can imagine the pleasure a mother feels when she files papers for her
son to run for president of the United States,'' Mrs. Bush said after turning in
the forms at the Secretary of State's Office.
</P>
<P>
	   She was joined by Gov. Jane Hull, who chairs Bush's campaign in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Bush said she was amazed at the number of people who have contributed
more than $67 million to his campaign. His fund raising is unmatched by any
previous campaign, including those of his father, former President Bush.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) -- Two backcountry skiers were killed in an avalanche
near a resort north of Park City.
</P>
<P>
	   The couple were reported missing Tuesday night after they failed to pick up
their child from a day care center, said Kim Peterson, a spokeswoman for The
Canyons resort. Their bodies were found buried in deep snow Wednesday outside
the resort's boundaries, Ms. Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
	   The victims' names were not immediately released, but police had said they
were looking for a 47-year-old man and a 41-year-old woman.
</P>
<P>
	   The man was wearing an avalanche locator beacon and had other safety
equipment with him, but the beacon's signal apparently was too weak to be of any
help to searchers, television station KUTV reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Peterson said avalanche danger was extremely high in the area because of
dramatic temperature changes that can make the snowpack unstable.

<HEADLINE> Violations in Crane Collapse  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Federal regulators fined three companies more than $500,000
Wednesday for safety violations in a crane collapse that killed three
ironworkers at the Milwaukee Brewers ballpark.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies denied the allegations. The workers were killed in July when a
crane lifting a 400-ton section of the ballpark's retractable roof toppled.
</P>
<P>
	   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined the company that
employed the ironworkers, Danny's Construction Co., $168,000 and alleged it
failed to keep employees clear of the suspended roof section.
</P>
<P>
	   Neil F. Lampson Inc., which leased the 567-foot crane to Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries, was fined $131,300. Mitsubishi was fined $240,500. They were accused
of overloading the crane and failing to factor in wind conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We feel that if these companies had been in compliance with our
regulations, possibly this tragedy would not have occurred,'' OSHA area director
George Yoksas said.
</P>
<P>
	   He declined to say what the agency thought caused the collapse.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators relied on a 78-second videotape taken by OSHA employees who
were at the ballpark the same day investigating a previous accident.
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Lampson, president of Neil F. Lampson Inc., said Wednesday his company
will appeal the citations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's absolutely inappropriate,'' he said. ``We leased the crane to
Mitsubishi and we're being cited for violations.''
</P>
<P>
	   Willie Mizell, president of Danny's Construction, said officials will meet
with OSHA before deciding whether to appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   Mitsubishi attorney Franklyn Gimbel said company officials also plan to meet
with OSHA officials in an attempt to erase or modify the citations. ``To claim
willfulness of these violations suggests that there was some conscious misdeeds,
and we just don't believe that's the fact,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Won't Mediate Russian Conflict  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration ruled out a role for the United
States in mediation between Russia and the rebels in Chechnya, and suggested
Europeans could take on the job.
</P>
<P>
	   But as Russian forces resumed an offensive in the republic Wednesday, there
was no indication Moscow would heed U.S. advice that it seek a political
solution to a threatened secession by negotiating with Chechen leaders,
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't believe that the result of the use of force is going to be the
melting away of resistance,'' the State Department spokesman James P. Rubin
said. ``We believe that the Russians are in a cul-de-sac, that they cannot by
their current strategy come to the end of road because there is no end to this
kind of fighting.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the start of a visit to Washington Wednesday night, Ilyas Akhmadov, who
acts as foreign minister in the Chechen government, said he was not seeking U.S.
help or mediation, but only understanding of the Chechen cause. He planned
meetings with members of Congress and others.
</P>
<P>
	   ``God forbid, I don't want the United States to bomb Russia or give us
weapons,'' Akhmadov said. His remarks at an academic institute forum were
translated from Russian.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The only aim of our government is to stop the total destruction of our
people, and we are prepared to do anything,'' he said. ``We are prepared to
negotiate.''
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the State Department is asking Russia for clarification of
reports that Chechen males between ages 18 and 60, would be detained to see
whether they had ties to rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is essential that Russia respect the fundamental human rights of
civilians in and around Chechnya., not endanger the lives of noncombatants, and
ensure freedom of movement for displaced persons,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Akhmadov said he appreciated the State Department's concern but more
important would be its reaction once it hears from Russia.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Report Warmer Earth  </HEADLINE>
   By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite conflicts in temperature data, there is strong
evidence of an accelerated warming of the Earth's surface during the past 20
years, a panel of the National Academy of Sciences concluded Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Still the panel hedged on whether the warming will continue or whether it is
tied to the ``greenhouse effect'' caused by manmade pollution of the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is a high level of confidence among the panel members that the
surface temperature is indeed rising,'' said John Wallace, panel chairman and
professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   But, he added, that does not necessarily mean the warming is due to manmade
greenhouse gasses ``nor are we saying it's necessarily going to continue to
accelerate in the future.'' The 20-year record is too short to make definitive
statements as to how the atmosphere is changing in the long term, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But the panel of 11 scientists said the warming of the earth during the past
two decades ``is undoubtedly real and is substantially greater than the average
rate of warming during the 20th century.'' The recent decades has seen some of
the warmest years on record, scientists have said.
</P>
<P>
	   The panel said global temperatures increased 0.45 to 0.72 degrees Fahrenheit
over the past 20 years. By comparison, temperatures increased 0.72 to 1.44
degrees Fahrenheit over the past 100 years, according to the panel.
</P>
<P>
	   The panel of the academy's National Research Council discounted the
significance of conflicting temperature data from ground monitors and those on
weather balloons and satellites.
</P>
<P>
	   According to surface monitors, the temperature of the earth over the last
100 years has increased 0.7 to 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit. The satellite and balloon
data, going back to 1979, have shown a warming trend in the upper atmosphere up
to 5 miles of no more than 0.36 degrees Fahrenheit, and in some cases none at
all.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics of the global warming theory often have cited the satellite and
balloon data as evidence that the threat of climate change has not been shown.
</P>
<P>
	   But the panel, whose members represented a broad spectrum of views on
climate change, concluded: ``The disparity between the surface and upper-air
trends in no way invalidates the conclusions that surface temperatures have been
rising.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're saying emphatically that it is not valid to equate these two kinds
of observations,'' said Wallace, adding that the discrepancies could not be
fully explained.
</P>
<P>
	   But the panel speculated that natural causes including two massive volcanic
eruptions during the past 20 years and depletion of the ozone layer, may have
had a cooling effect in the upper air region, as opposed to surface
temperatures, during the time period where satellite data have been available.
</P>
<P>
	   But some environmentalists said the panel has shot a hole into one of the
global warming skeptics' most powerful arguments.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It completely deflates the argument that contrarians have been using in
support of the position that global warming isn't worth dealing with,'' said
Michael Oppenheimer, a climate scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund.
</P>
<P>
	   The panel has clarified a key area of confusion, said Oppenheimer in an
interview. ``It should put a complete end to the argument over whether the Earth
has warmed. There is no doubt the earth has warmed.''
</P>
<P>
	   Not so, said John Christy, a climatologist at the University of
Alabama-Huntsville and a member of the academy's panel, who said the report
confirms that the earth has become warmer over the past 100 years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's still not clear as to whether this is a representative sample that
will tell us how the greenhouse effect is gong to be plaid out. You can't use
this trend for prediction.''
</P>
<P>
	   The panel included a wide range of views on climate change including James
Hansen of the Goddard Institute for Spaces Studies, who is a strong proponent of
the greenhouse effect, and Roy Spencer a senior climate scientist at NASA, who
developed the satellite temperature data.

<HEADLINE> Second drug dealer implicates Camden mayor at trial of accused drug  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - A second convicted drug dealer implicated Camden
Mayor Milton Milan at the trial Wednesday of an accused drug lord, suggesting
that Milan bought cocaine from the cartel.
<P>
	   Milan has angrily denied allegations, made over the past week in federal
court, that he purchased bulk amounts of cocaine in 1993, four years before
becoming mayor.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor's name has surfaced in the drug conspiracy trial of accused
kingpins Jose "J.R." Rivera and Luis "Tun Tun" Figueroa. The two are accused of
running the largest cocaine ring in Camden history.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, in another surprising twist, the name of reputed Philadelphia
organized crime leader Joseph "Skinny Joey" Merlino came up during testimony by
another drug dealer who said he held contraband for Merlino while the two were
in the same jail.
</P>
<P>
	   Angel Torres testified Wednesday that Milan was one of three people who
purchased parts of two large shipments of cocaine from New York. Torres worked
for the "33rd Street Set," which controlled one of the most lucrative drug
markets in Camden.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked by Assistant U.S. Attorney Sally Smith to name some of the ring's
customers, Torres replied, "Davey, Milton and Tony," adding, "I don't know their
last names."
</P>
<P>
	   While awaiting an elevator outside the courtroom after his testimony, Torres
refused to elaborate on his comments, saying, "I ain't got no answers for that."
</P>
<P>
	   However, Milan's attorney, Carlos Martir, said the testimony was a clear
reference to his client. Milan has not been charged in the drug conspiracy case,
but has been targeted by federal authorities in an ongoing corruption probe in
Camden.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's all part of the government's attempt to begin the trial of Milton
Milan before he's even accused of a crime," said Martir, who also represents
Figueroa.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's clear that the government wants information regarding Milan more than
they want information regarding the drug sets," Martir said an interview after
Torres testified.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, there was little testimony Wednesday implicating Rivera or
Figueroa. One former drug dealer-turned government witness said he did not know
Figueroa and another said he had never met Rivera.
</P>
<P>
	   But admitted drug dealer Lucas Torres brought up Merlino's name Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Under questioning by Rivera's attorney, Lucas Torres said he was punished
after he was caught holding contraband for Merlino in the Salem County Jail.
Torres also admitted smoking marijuana he purchased in jail from another drug
dealer serving time there.
</P>
<P>
	   "Joey Merlino told me to hold his pack of smoke," Lucas Torres wrote in a
letter to the FBI read in court Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Apparently they're friends in jail," said Marc Neff, Rivera's attorney.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Angel Torres testified he traveled to Manhattan in the summer of
1993 to pick up about 15 kilos to 20 kilos of cocaine and returned about a month
later to get another shipment. The cocaine was brought to Camden, diluted and
sold.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was given to all the big drug dealers in Camden," Angel Torres said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he delivered cocaine packages ranging from 4 1/2 ounces to a kilo
and collected payments. He offered no details on the alleged purchase by Milan
and the prosecutor did not ask him to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial has yielded testimony about drugs, sex, revenge, retaliation and
corrupt police officers on the take to protect the cocaine ring.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, another drug dealer, Camildo Cruz, testified that Milan's cocaine
purchases totaled in the kilograms. A kilogram equals about 2.2 pounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Cruz testified that Luis Soto, who also worked for the set, sold some of the
organizations's cocaine to Milan. Torres worked for Cruz and Soto, who were
high-ranking members of the faction.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors say Rivera, 40, a boyhood friend of Milan, was the major drug
procurer and financier for the cartel and Figueroa, 34, was an enforcer who used
violence to protect the ring.
</P>
<P>
	   Law enforcement officials have said the organization ran a
multimillion-dollar-a-year business, and was the most entrenched and significant
drug cartel in Camden's history.
</P>
<P>
	   Rivera and Figueroa - the only defendants to go to trial - maintain their
innocence. The remaining dozen defendants pleaded guilty and are providing
incriminating testimony detailing the organization's operations.

<HEADLINE> Russian Security Concept Changing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Acting President Vladimir Putin has shifted the focus of
Russia's national security doctrine so it focuses more on the fight against
terrorism and the notion of a multipolar world, his press service said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin signed the decree altering Russia's National Security Concept last
week, but the actual alterations were not made public.
</P>
<P>
	   The new document says that Russia will promote a multipolar world by
strengthening the economic and political positions of various countries.

	   The formula first took shape during the later years of former President
Boris Yeltsin's tenure, when Russia wanted to counter what it has described as
U.S. domination of global affairs and attempts to build a ``unipolar world.''
</P>
<P>
	   It has tried to develop close cooperation with such regional powers as China
and India to serve as an example of local power centers not dependent on the

international political developments, primarily under U.N. sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent years, Russia's relations with the United States and other Western
nations have been strained by controversy over NATO's expansion, the bombing of
Yugoslavia, Russia's war in breakaway Chechnya and other disputes.
</P>
<P>
	   The revised document also sets out the role of nuclear weapons to defend
Russia's national security.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia ``must possess nuclear forces that can guarantee the infliction of
intended damage to an aggressor state or coalition,'' the document says. Still,
it stresses that nuclear arms can be used only if all other means of resolving a
crisis are exhausted.
</P>
<P>
	   The doctrine describes terrorism and especially international terrorism as a
serious threat to Russia's security.
</P>
<P>
	   ``An open (terrorist) campaign has been unleashed to destabilize the
situation in Russia,'' it said in reference to Chechen separatists, who have
been blamed for a recent series of apartment bombings in Russia.

<HEADLINE> U.N. May Expand Sierra Leone Force  </HEADLINE>
   By JOSEF FEDERMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The U.N. Security Council on Wednesday began
considering a proposal to nearly double the size of a U.N. peacekeeping force in
Sierra Leone and to give it broader authority to maintain security in the West
African country.
</P>
<P>
	   The British draft resolution followed a call by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan to expand the multinational peacekeeping force to make up for the
departure of Nigerian troops who led a separate West African intervention force.
</P>
<P>
	   Annan first proposed expanding the U.N. mission last month after Nigeria
said it was pulling out of Sierra Leone. Annan outlined his proposal in a report
Wednesday, presenting a plan to beef up the force from 6,000 to 11,100 members
and to give it broader authority in maintaining security.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The rapid expansion ... will be indispensable in maintaining the necessary
security conditions for the implementation of the Lome Agreement,'' Annan wrote,
referring to the July 7 cease-fire that ended the country's eight-year civil
war.
</P>
<P>
	   Britain's draft resolution closely resembles Annan's proposal. It says a
force numbering up to 11,100 military personnel is needed to provide security at
government buildings, airports, important intersections and other key locations.
</P>
<P>
	   The peacekeepers also would assist the government in disarming former
fighters and integrating them back into civilian life.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We must keep this process going and make sure that the Lome Accord, the
agreement on Sierra Leone, is brought to a final conclusion,'' British
Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock said.
</P>
<P>
	   The peacekeepers now have a mandate to merely monitor the cease-fire and
disarm fighters. The West African force, known as ECOMOG, was in charge of
overall security in the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Rebels still control parts of the countryside, banditry and lawlessness are
growing, attacks on civilians persist and the process of disarming fighters and
moving them back into civilian life has been slow, Annan's report said.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Annan said the situation has improved in areas where U.N. troops have
arrived.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States, which is billed 25 percent of the U.N. peacekeeping
budget, indicated reservations last month about whether Congress would approve
such a tremendous increase for the Sierra Leone mission.
</P>
<P>
	   But U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke said Wednesday an increase of some
sort was necessary.
</P>
<P>
	   A senior U.N. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Annan's
proposal had been well received in the council. The official said he expected to
see an agreement in the coming weeks. He said that cost -- the current mission
is estimated to cost about $200 million through June -- could be an issue.
</P>
<P>
	   In the meantime, the official said, Nigeria was coordinating the departure
of the remaining 4,000 or so ECOMOG soldiers with the arrival of U.N. soldiers.
</P>
<P>
	   Tens of thousands of people were killed during Sierra Leone's civil war, and
many more were maimed in a systematic campaign of rebel terror.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Appears on Letterman  </HEADLINE>
   By DEEPTI HAJELA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Quipping that she finally agreed to take the hot seat next
to David Letterman because she lost a bet with Tipper Gore, a nervous Hillary
Rodham Clinton was a pretty good match for the late-night host on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady made her first visit to the ``Late Show,'' after the host had
spent weeks making a running gag of her plan to run for Senate in New York.
Letterman has called Mrs. Clinton a carpetbagger from Arkansas seeking political
opportunity in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Confronted with the first lady in the flesh, Letterman at first set aside
his trademark sarcasm and lobbed her a softball, asking her to ``tell us about
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton smirked and told Letterman she grew up in the Midwest -- as he
did -- has a mother named Dorothy -- as he does -- and just couldn't resist the
temptation to follow him to New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton's likely Senate opponent, Republican New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, has been on the show nearly 20 times, chatting up Letterman
about the New York Yankees, Mrs. Clinton and life in New York. He's even gotten
some laughs in a few comedy skits.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton admitted to being ``just a little'' nervous, but told
Letterman: ``I knew if I was going to run for Senate, I was going to have to
come and sit in this chair and talk to the big guy.''
</P>
<P>
	   She aced Letterman's New York quiz, correctly identifying the state bird
(bluebird) and the state tree (sugar maple).
</P>
<P>
	   Her top 10 reasons for appearing on the show included: ``I lost a bet with
Tipper'' and ``If Dan Quayle did it, how hard could it be?''
</P>
<P>
	   The show was to air Wednesday night at 11:30 EST.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav: NATO Bombs Killed 2,000  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia killed some
2,000 people, half of whom were children, a top Yugoslav army general said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   NATO carried out its 78-day bombing campaign last year in an effort to stop
government troops' crackdown against ethnic Albanians in Serbia's southern
province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   The independent Beta news agency quoted Gen. Vladimir Lazarevic as saying
that ``NATO did not accomplish any of its declared goals but it killed 2,000
innocent victims, 50 percent of whom were children.''
</P>
<P>
	   NATO has not confirmed a number of people killed by its airstrikes in
Yugoslavia. Serbian officials have said before that more than 300 people died,
but that number was unconfirmed as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Lazarevic did not give a breakdown of the death toll between civilians and
the Yugoslav military, nor say on what his estimate was based. Earlier
statements by top officials of Yugoslavia, the federation of Serbia and
Montenegro, had mentioned some 500 casualties among the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
	   Lazarevic was one of the top commanders in Kosovo during the conflict.
</P>
<P>
	   The bombardment ended when the government troops agreed to pull out from the
province, which opened way for the deployment of an international peacekeeping
force in Kosovo, which is now administered by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, police arrested and questioned a top opposition official for
several hours Wednesday, the opposition Serbian Renewal Movement said. Miladin
Kovacevic, a top adviser to opposition party leader Vuk Draskovic, was
confronted by the police in a Belgrade street and taken into custody, a
statement from the opposition party said. He was released later in the day.
</P>
<P>
	   Serbian Renewal Movement and other opposition parties agreed this week on a
new, joint effort to try oust Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. Kovacevic
was the official who announced the decision Monday.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Rallying for Boy's Return  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- The latest rally Wednesday in Cuba's campaign for the return
of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez featured empassioned speeches, folk music and
children's dance performances -- but no official reaction to the latest legal
maneuvering in the United States in the case.
</P>
<P>
	   With daily legal developments in the United States, Cuban authorities said
privately that official reaction was unlikely until Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   As hundreds of public health workers rallied Wednesday evening to demand the
child's return, Cuba stepped up its national press coverage of Americans who
support Elian's return. The Communist Party reprinted a statement issued this
week by the U.S. National Council of Churches pushing for the boy to be brought
back from Florida and provided wide coverage of protests by Americans in New
York.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest legal move came Wednesday from Attorney General Janet Reno, who
brushed aside a Florida court judge's order that Elian remain with his American
relatives until March 6 so the court can hear arguments from the boy's relatives
in Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   They are seeking temporary custody of Elian, who has been in Florida since
Thanksgiving Day, when he was found floating on an inner tube off the coast. His
mother was lost at sea in an apparent attempt to immigrate illegally to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno said that any challenge to the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service's decision that Elian should be returned to Cuba must come in federal
rather than state court. She said she would allow Elian's Miami relatives to
seek relief in federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, has demanded that his son be returned,
and Elian's relatives in Miami say they can give him a better life off the
communist island.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those at the protest Wednesday was Dr. Evelio Cabezas, head of Cuba's
national organization of gynecology and obstetrics, who noted that all Cuban
women receive specialized care while they are pregnant.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Elian should return to his homeland, which cared for him even before he
was born, and again afterward and will for always,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of the uncertainty over Elian's return, communist leaders have
called on Cubans to continue protesting to press U.S. officials to repatriate
him.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Defends Letter for Company  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURENCE ARNOLD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bill Bradley on Wednesday dismissed as ``not a big deal''
a letter he wrote in 1994 on behalf of a New Jersey company whose officers had
donated money to his Senate campaign account.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, who represented New Jersey, said he didn't think it was ``wrong at
all'' to urge the Commerce Department to give ``fair treatment'' to Sigma Corp.
of Cream Ridge, N.J.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's president, Victor Pais, said Bradley ``did nothing other than
just write a routine letter'' that was unrelated to political donations made 15
months earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   But the existence of the letter, first reported in Wednesday's Boston Globe,
put Bradley on the defensive hours before was to detail his criticisms of the
campaign finance system in general.
</P>
<P>
	   Although all candidates were invited, Bradley was the only presidential
candidate who attended an evening campaign finance forum in Manchester, N.H.,
co-sponsored by Common Cause, which supports overhauling federal campaign
finance laws.
</P>
<P>
	   At the forum, Bradley repeated his call for campaign finance changes and
promised to be a president ``who is prepared to put his clout on the line in
order to liberate our democracy from the tentacles of money.'' He said he has
been more committed to the issue than Vice President Al Gore, his rival for the
Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   In questioning Bradley, an audience member confused Gore and GOP
front-runner George W. Bush. ``You can get those two mixed up, I know,'' Bradley
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley had invited scrutiny of his Senate letter-writing record days
earlier, after questions were raised about letters written by Republican
presidential candidate Sen. John McCain on behalf of a major contributor.
Bradley said at the time that his policy during his 18 years in the Senate was
not to ``intervene in regulatory matters.''
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about the Sigma letter in Iowa on Wednesday, Bradley maintained that
writing letters to regulators ``wasn't a practice'' and that the discovery of
one or two such letters does not undermine his general policy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think it's wrong at all,'' he said about the 1994 letter. ``What
am I going to say to a New Jersey company -- 'No, I'm not going to write on your
behalf and ask for a decision to be made'?''
</P>
<P>
	   His spokeswoman, Kristen Ludecke added, ``This is communicating on behalf of
a constituent and helping them navigate the bureaucracy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Al Gore declined to comment on the letter. Asked whether he
wrote similar ones as a senator from Tennessee, Gore said: ``I've never claimed
not to have helped my constituents and my state and my congressional district.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sigma, which manufactures industrial pipe fittings, appealed a 1992 decision
by the International Trade Commission to impose a 127 percent duty on exports to
the United States by China National Metal Products. Sigma, which imports and
distributes water pipe fittings made by the Chinese company, protested the duty.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Court of International Trade returned the case to the Commerce
Department in June 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   Days later, Bradley wrote to then-Commerce Secretary Ron Brown: ``Sigma has
now been denied access to its CDIW fittings, a critical part of its product
line, for over two years. It only seems right that your department do its best
to ensure that this case not drag out any longer than necessary.''
</P>
<P>
	   In 1993, company president Pais and vice president Mark Abrams each had
donated $500 to Bradley's Senate campaign account.
</P>
<P>
	   Pais said Wednesday that Abrams was interested in politics and that both men
made campaign contributions, ``from time to time, not anything extensive.'' He
said the donations had nothing to do with the company's decision to seek
Bradley's help.
</P>
<P>
	   Pais said Sigma sought a meeting with Bradley in 1994, but had to settle for
a letter after Bradley's staff said the senator was too busy.
</P>
<P>
	   Pais said Bradley's letter had no effect on the case, which the company
ultimately won in court.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Releasing Age of Ancient Man  </HEADLINE>
   By LINDA ASHTON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) -- The federal government on Thursday will release
results of carbon-dating tests on Kennewick Man, one of the oldest and most
complete skeletons found in North America.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Department of the Interior also will decide whether to classify the
human remains as Native American under federal law.
</P>
<P>
	   Whatever the conclusions, the results are likely to be disputed in this
contentious case.
</P>
<P>
	   The collection of 350 bones known as Kennewick Man was found in the shallows
of the Columbia River in 1996. Initial tests indicated Kennewick Man was about
9,200 years old.
</P>
<P>
	   Typically, the government has classified bones over 500 years old as Native
American, citing the 1990 federal Native American Graves Protection and
Repatriation Act.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawyer for eight prominent anthropologists who have sued for the right
to study the bones argues that the government has incorrectly interpreted the
federal statute that defines how remains are classified as Native American.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The statute says a skeleton like this is Native American only if it can be
shown to be related to a present-day tribe or culture,'' Alan L. Schneider, a
Portland, Ore., lawyer representing the plaintiff anthropologists, said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   In a report for the Interior Department, scientists in October said
Kennewick man may have had Asian or Polynesian roots.
</P>
<P>
	   National Park Service chief archaeologist Francis McManamon will make public
the latest test results, providing an estimate of Kennewick Man's age, at the
Burke Museum in Seattle, where the remains are stored.
</P>
<P>
	   A coalition of five Northwest Indian tribes, which claims Kennewick Man as
an ancestor and seeks the return of the bones for reburial without study,
objected to the carbon-dating tests as a desecration. The process requires the
destruction of a small amount of bone.
</P>
<P>
	   The Interior Department also has a March 24 deadline in U.S. District Court
in Portland to say whether the bones could be culturally affiliated with any
modern-day tribe.
</P>
<P>
	   The government also is supposed to decide by that date if it will allow the
anthropologists to study the bones.
</P>
<P>
	   The anthropologists have been pressing in court for DNA testing as the most
effective means of determining Kennewick Man's origins, which is a key factor in
determining who gets custody of the bones.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Wednesday, the leader of an Old Norse pagan group that also had gone to
court claiming Kennewick Man as an ancestor said his Asatru Folk Assembly was
withdrawing from the legal dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   Stephen McNallen of Nevada City, Calif., said he had run out of money, time
and energy, ``plus a feeling there is no way justice will be obtained in the
case.''

<HEADLINE> Polls: Send Cuban Boy Home  </HEADLINE>
   By WILL LESTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than half of Americans approve of the federal
decision to send 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, who was found clinging to an inner
tube off the coast of Florida, back to Cuba to be with his father, two new polls
say.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal officials say he should be returned to his father, but a Florida
judge has said he cannot be returned until a March hearing. Attorney General
Janet Reno said Wednesday that only a federal court can make such a ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   The percentage of Americans who wanted the boy returned has increased
slightly in polls by ABC News and CNN-USA Today-Gallup. In polls taken in
December, just under half wanted him returned.
</P>
<P>
	   The ABC poll indicated that 52 percent favored the boy's return to Cuba,
while 36 percent thought he should stay here. Just under half, 46 percent,
wanted to see him returned last month, while a third thought he should stay.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The changes were not huge, but we had fewer who were undecided this
time,'' said ABC pollster Gary Langer. ``The issue has been getting a lot of
attention. More people have information on it.''
</P>
<P>
	   A CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll found that 56 percent approve of the boy's
return while 36 percent thought he should stay. Last month, people were about
evenly split, but the decision by the U.S. government decision to return him to
his father in Cuba may have increased the number who support that move, said
Lydia Saad, managing editor of the Gallup Poll.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Public opinion can be altered by an official decision,'' she said.
``There's a degree of authority to the decision -- particularly on an issue
where the public did not have strong opinions.''
</P>
<P>
	   Men supported the boy's return to his father in Cuba by a slightly larger

<HEADLINE> Bush Exploits McCain's Tax Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By CALVIN WOODWARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential rivals George W. Bush and John
McCain are accusing each other of promoting tax plans that would subject
middle-income families to a complex and potentially costly tax regimen meant
only for the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
	   At issue is the alternative minimum tax, which normally kicks in to ensure
well-off Americans pay their share. The Bush and McCain campaigns each assert
the other's tax cuts would be blunted by leaving many more average income
earners exposed to the minimum tax.
</P>
<P>
	   Campaigning in South Carolina on Wednesday, Bush said McCain's proposals
contained a ``serious flaw'' that actually ``may be a tax increase for many
people.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain spokesman Dan Schnur denied that, saying the senator is committed to
ensuring average Americans get the full value of his tax savings. But he
acknowledged more work must be done on the plan to protect middle-income people
from the minimum tax.
</P>
<P>
	   Moreover, he said the Texas governor's plan suffers from the same
shortcoming that Bush's aides are trying to exploit in the McCain package. He
quoted from an article last month in the newsletter Tax Notes by Al Davis, an
economist for congressional Democrats, saying, ``Many households will not get
the tax cuts portrayed in the Bush documents, unless major revenue-losing
changes are also made in the alternative minimum tax.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain this week announced a five-year plan costing $237 billion that would
put more people in the bottom 15 percent tax bracket, end dozens of business tax
breaks to help pay for the package and leave money from projected budget
surpluses aside for Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's $483 billion, five-year plan, to be paid for largely from expected
surpluses, would eventually lower all income tax rates, bringing the bottom
bracket down to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and McCain both propose doubling the child tax credit to $1,000. But
Larry Lindsey, Bush's chief economic adviser, told reporters Wednesday the
governor's plan exempts the child credit from the alternative minimum tax and
the senator's does not.
</P>
<P>
	   Changing McCain's plan to protect middle-income Americans would cost
billions and throw its cost calculations out of kilter, Lindsey said.
</P>
<P>
	   Schnur said the senator won't let the minimum tax reduce the savings his
plan would make available to people in the 15 percent bracket.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We realize that fixing the (minimum tax provision) will cost additional
money,'' Schnur said. He said McCain will propose the closing of additional
corporate loopholes to cover the cost.
</P>
<P>
	   People subject to the minimum tax have to calculate their liability in two
different ways and pay the higher amount. That's designed to stop wealthier
people from using so many deductions and credits that they end up owing little
or nothing.
</P>
<P>
	   Lindsey contended that under McCain's plan as written, more than 10 million
middle-income families would be caught in that web and lose much of the value of
the child tax credit.
</P>
<P>
	   In his example, a single parent with two children who makes $45,000 would,
under the normal calculation, owe $4,425 on taxable income of $29,500. But then
she would have her liability reduced to $2,425 after taking the credit of $1,000
for each child.
</P>
<P>
	   With the McCain plan, he said, that parent would also have to figure out her
liability under the minimum tax. Without access to the child credit in this
calculation, she would end up with a tax bill of $3,250 -- $825 more than if she
were protected from the minimum tax.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was up front about the loose strings in his plan, saying that as it
is now drafted, some taxpayers might be hurt by the minimum tax. He said
extensive research was needed to estimate the cost of sheltering people, and he
promised ``appropriate adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lindsey acknowledged that the Bush tax plan rolled out in early December
does not spell out its exemption of the child tax credit. Bush aides decided at
the time that it was too ``wonky'' to explain.
</P>
<P>
	   But he said the Bush plan takes the exemption into account in its cost
calculations, and devotes some $30 billion to making sure middle-income
Americans are not bumped into the minimum tax by the child credit.
</P>
<P>
	   Schnur disputed that Bush advisers ever provided for such a breakdown and
said their estimate of the cost of protecting people from the minimum tax -- $10
billion a year when tax plans are fully in effect -- was wildly overblown.

<HEADLINE> Haitians Seek Immigration Equality  </HEADLINE>
   By MILDRADE CHERFILS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Haitian activists staged a mock funeral and protest march
Wednesday to draw attention to disparities in the treatment of Haitian and Cuban
immigrants who seek asylum in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The protesters pointed to the international custody battle over Elian
Gonzalez, a 6-year-old Cuban boy, and contrasted that with the plight of a
pregnant woman whose children were returned to Haiti this month while she
remained in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are asking for fairness, equality and due process,'' said Aude Sicard,
an activist with the Haitian-American Grassroots Coalition. ``Haitian children
are children too.''
</P>
<P>
	   Under U.S. immigration policy, Haitians and others who arrive illegally are
sent back to their country. The Cuban Readjustment Act of 1966 grants any Cuban
who reaches American soil the right to stay.
</P>
<P>
	   But Haitians claim they are routinely repatriated -- sent back to Haiti --
without being allowed to request a hearing to determine whether they have a
``credible fear'' of persecution in their homeland.
</P>
<P>
	   They claim that the repatriation of 407 Haitian migrants attempting to enter
the United States illegally on New Year's Day was unfair -- especially in light
of the fight to keep Elian after he survived an illegal attempt to reach
Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   Passengers on the boat from Haiti said as many as six people died during the
journey, and their bodies were thrown overboard.
</P>
<P>
	   In honor of those who died, the activists staged a mock funeral that was
attended by about 300 Haitians and black Americans in Miami's Little Haiti
section. The ceremony was followed by a candlelight march. Protesters carried
three coffins draped in black, and several marchers wearing red and blue
armbands.
</P>
<P>
	   Encel Alcime, a 75-year-old retired Miami-Dade County water department
worker, said his fellow Haitian immigrants are treated differently than Cubans
because they are black.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Haitians are taken from the water and sent back right away, which means
that they don't need us here,'' Alcime said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the New Year's trip, four of the 411 passengers were brought to shore for
medical reasons, including Yvena Rhinvil, who is four months pregnant.
</P>
<P>
	   But her children, ages 8 and 9, were among those repatriated to Haiti, where
they are living with an aunt.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials said they weren't told Rhinvil's children were with her. ``If
we would have known that she had children on board, we would have brought the
children with her,'' said Coast Guard spokesman Luis Diaz.
</P>
<P>
	   Activists didn't believe it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's a big lie,'' Sicard said. ``All during the trip down back to Haiti,
they thought that their mother had died. This is inhuman.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rhinvil, 33, has passed the ``credible fear'' standard and is applying for
political asylum, a process that can take months.
</P>
<P>
	   Cheryl Little, an attorney with the Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center, who
is representing Rhinvil, wrote to Attorney General Janet Reno and INS
Commissioner Doris Meissner, urging them to reunite the family.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When I met with her, the first thing she said was, `Please help me find my
children,''' Little said. ``She feared for the worst. She thought that they had
drowned.''
</P>
<P>
	   Immigration and Naturalization Service spokesman Russ Bergeron said
immigration officials were considering the request.
</P>
<P>
	   Haitian activists also point to the outcry over the treatment of six Cubans
who jumped from a 14-foot rowboat about 150 yards from shore in a desperate
attempt to reach the United States in June.
</P>
<P>
	   News footage showed authorities blasting the Cubans with a hose as they
stood in their rowboat and dousing one swimmer with pepper spray.
</P>
<P>
	   Two reached the beach and four were plucked from the water by the Coast
Guard. All were allowed to stay in the country to pursue their claims.
</P>
<P>
	   Bergeron said the decision was made ``given the circumstances surrounding
the Coast Guard procedures,'' and illustrated an ``exceptional circumstance.''

<HEADLINE> N.J. Casinos Won $4.1B in 1999  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- Gamblers lost $4.1 billion in the city's casinos
last year, the highest total in the 21-year history of legalized gambling in New
Jersey, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The 12 casinos won $2.9 billion on slot machines and $1.2 billion from table
games, an overall increase of 3.3 percent over 1998, the state Casino Control
Commission reported.
</P>
<P>
	   All but two casinos -- Resorts Atlantic City and Trump Plaza -- won more
from gamblers in 1999 than they did in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Trump Plaza's poor showing, down 5.5 percent from 1998, was due in part to
the October closing of Trump World's Fair Casino, which is scheduled to be
demolished. Trump World's Fair's revenues were always counted as part of those
of Trump Plaza because they shared one casino license. The properties, which sat
on either side of Convention Hall, were linked through a pedestrian walkway.
</P>
<P>
	   The previous annual record take by the casinos was $4 billion, set in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Sale of Radioactive Metals Canceled  </HEADLINE>
   By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Energy Department retreated Wednesday from plans to
sell thousands of tons of radioactive metal from its weapons production
facilities as scrap, saying the potential health concerns need to be more
clearly examined.
</P>
<P>
	   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson blocked plans to sell 6,000 tons of nickel
taken from a defunct uranium enrichment plant at Oak Ridge, Tenn., thus keeping
it out of civilian commerce.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the department also was developing a formal policy to prevent the
future sale of 10,000 additional tons of radioactive metals, mostly nickel, at
other Energy Department facilities.
</P>
<P>
	   The action applies to ``volumetrically contaminated'' scrap metals -- mostly
nickel -- that have radioactivity embedded throughout, and not just on the
surface. Some nuclear watchdog groups have argued that the more than 120,000
tons of scrap metals with surface contamination also should be kept out of the
civilian market.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers who have pressed the administration to abandon the recycling
program applauded Richardson's action.
</P>
<P>
	   The sale of the nickel at Oak Ridge ``could have put U.S. workers, consumers
and steel producers in a very precarious situation,'' said Rep. Ron Klink,
D-Pa..
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., said ``common sense is finally beginning to take
hold.''
</P>
<P>
	   British Nuclear Fuel Inc., which is under DOE contract to clean up the Oak
Ridge facility, planned to sell the nickel to private buyers for $41 million
later this year. The company contended the nickel could be cleaned to the point
that it no longer would pose a health risk.
</P>
<P>
	   The sale had been approved by the state of Tennessee and in 1997 by the
federal Energy Department.
</P>
<P>
	   But it prompted criticism from nuclear watchdog groups, members of Congress
and some leaders of the steel industry, who were concerned about having to
explain to consumers why their products contained radioactive metals, even in
low doses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This plan had all the makings of being penny-wise and pound-foolish,''
said Klink in a statement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson said he was modifying the government's contract with British
Nuclear Fuel to block the impending sale at Oak Ridge or any future release of
similarly contaminated metals -- primarily nickel -- into the open market.
</P>
<P>
	   The long-range policy will cover not only the nickel at Oak Ridge but also
10,000 tons of metals -- mostly nickel -- being kept primarily at the Portsmouth
Gaseous Diffusion plant in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This will give the Nuclear Regulatory Commission time to develop national
standards for volumetrically contaminated materials ... (and) it will allow DOE
to examine alternatives to free release,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
	   It was unclear when the NRC planned to consider a proposed standard for such
scrap metals. The NRC regulates consumer products where radiation has been
intentionally added, but has said the state had jurisdiction over the planned
nickel recycling at Oak Ridge.
</P>
<P>
	   While materials with surface contamination often can be cleaned, it is
unclear whether radioactivity that permeates a metal can be sufficiently
removed.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, some critics said Richardson was taking only half measures
because he does not address the recycling of scrap metals and other materials --
some 120,000 tons at DOE weapons facilities -- that contain only surface
radiation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we're concerned about is this will be just window dressing,'' said
David Adelman, an attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, which sued
to try to stop the recycling.
</P>
<P>
	   Wenonah Hauter, director of the Public Citizen Critical Mass Energy Project,
a nuclear watchdog group, said: ``Even if you believe that metal contaminated on
the surface by radioactive isotopes can be adequately cleaned, and we believe it
can't, who would possibly believe DOE can competently carry out a radioactive
recycling program?''

<HEADLINE> U.N. Demands Bosnian Cooperation  </HEADLINE>
   By NICOLE WINFIELD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council demanded Wednesday that Bosnia's
three presidents fully implement a new U.S.-brokered agreement on cooperation
and implementation of the Dayton peace process, saying claims that the agreement
was invalid were false.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am here today to express our considerable annoyance at the delays,''
said the council president, U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
	   Holbrooke brokered the accord last Nov. 15 in a meeting in New York with
Bosnia's three presidents, Ante Jelavic, a Croat; Alija Izetbegovic, a Muslim;
and Zivko Radisic, a Bosnian Serb.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York Declaration, as it is known, was intended to pick up the pace
of the Dayton peace process and get Bosnia's Serbs, Croats and Muslims working
better together to form a united, democratic and multiethnic society.
</P>
<P>
	   Mistrust among the groups, who fought a 3 1/2-year war, has kept over a
million refugees from returning to their prewar homes.
</P>
<P>
	   In the declaration, the three presidents agreed to establish a joint border
patrol, support a single national passport, create a permanent executive staff
for their joint presidency and make a commitment to fully fund state ministries.
Their priority, they said at the time, was the return of displaced people and
refugees to their homes.
</P>
<P>
	   But two weeks after the accord was presented to the Security Council,
Radisic told the Bosnian Serb parliament that he had agreed only to work on
elements of the accord, which he described as an ``expression of the will''
rather than a binding commitment.
</P>
<P>
	   Holbrooke disputed that Wednesday after the council was briefed on the
situation in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That declaration submitted to the world body had standing,'' Holbrooke
said. ``The Security Council was unanimous in calling on the joint presidency to
implement the agreement.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the council would ask the U.N. chief's special representative in
Bosnia to consult urgently with the joint presidency to move the agreement
forward.

<HEADLINE> Cos. Accused of Space Shuttle Fraud  </HEADLINE>
    By LINDA DEUTSCH AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Three companies were sued by the government for
allegedly concealing fraud by a subcontractor that spent millions from space
shuttle program funds on homes, jewelry and exotic vacations, it was disclosed
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Justice Department suit, filed Tuesday, named Rockwell
International Inc., Boeing North American Inc. and United Space Alliance, the
current space shuttle contractor. The suit said United Space Alliance was liable
as a successor company.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing issued a statement saying it had cooperated in the investigation and
believed it was not liable for the actions of its subcontractor. The head of the
subcontracting firm pleaded guilty to fraud five years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The suit contended that Rockwell officials knew about the improper costs and
submitted false claims to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
which resulted in overbilling and unallowable expenses between 1986 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   Calls made after business hours to Rockwell headquarters in Milwaukee and to
United Space Alliance in Houston were not answered.
</P>
<P>
	   Space shuttle builder Rockwell, then based in California, was chosen in the
1980s and early 1990s to manage and operate the shuttle and space station
programs with contracts awarded for more than $4.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreements provided for more than $325 million in award fees or bonuses
to Rockwell based upon its performance, including how well it managed costs and
monitored its subcontractors.
</P>
<P>
	   In late 1996, Rockwell sold its defense and aerospace businesses to Boeing,
which assumed the contracts under its Boeing North American division. The
acquisition included Rockwell's 50 percent share in United Space Alliance, a
joint venture with Lockheed Martin Corp., to take over shuttle operations from
NASA.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the lawsuit, Rockwell had hired a subcontractor, Omniplan
Corp., to handle cost controls and management.
</P>
<P>
	   The suit said Omniplan established phony companies in order to lease
buildings and equipment to itself at inflated values, and commingled millions of
dollars in personal expenses with corporate accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   The suit cited such activities as operating a pizza delivery company out of
a building Rockwell was billing to NASA.
</P>
<P>
	   Omniplan also included as allowable expenses the purchases of personal
houses, a ski lodge, expensive jewelry and personal vacations to exotic locales
including Nepal, Singapore and Argentina, the suit said.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1995 the owner of Omniplan, Ralph Montijo, pleaded guilty to about 180
felony fraud violations.
</P>
<P>
	   "We regret that the government has chosen to file this complaint which
involves a subcontractor that was ultimately convicted of fraud several years
ago," said the Boeing statement.
</P>
<P>
	   "We cooperated with the government investigation at that time," Boeing said.
"We deny we had any knowledge of the fraud and we do not believe we are liable
under the False Claims Act."
</P>
<P>
	   Under the act, the government could seek treble damages plus civil penalties
ranging from $5,000 to $10,000 per violation.

<HEADLINE> Ex-HMO Execs' Contracts Terminated  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BOSTON (AP) -- In a move expected to save $2 million, state officials on
Wednesday terminated the lucrative consulting contracts of former executives at
Harvard Pilgrim Health Care and accepted the resignation of the chairman of the
board.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney General Thomas Reilly said state officials, who have the
financially ailing HMO in receivership, terminated contracts that were part of
the severance packages for the former chief executive officer, Allan Greenberg,
and the former chief financial officer, Thomas Brophy.
</P>
<P>
	   Reilly also announced that the receivers had accepted the resignation of the
chairman of the board, Alan Morse, retroactive to Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   All told, Reilly said, the actions were expected to save $2 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The announcements came at a daily briefing held by Reilly and Insurance
Commissioner Linda Ruthardt, who has been named the receiver for the HMO.
</P>
<P>
	   Just last week, the region's largest HMO, with 1.1 million members in
Massachusetts, was placed under receivership, hours after revealing an
accounting error that boosted its year-end losses by about $50 million, bringing
total losses to more than $150 million.
</P>
<P>
	   J. David Leslie, a special assistant attorney general who's helping review
the HMO's situation, said the contracts with the executives were terminated
because of the deficiencies in the HMO's accounting system that came to light
last week when the "surprise" results were announced.
</P>
<P>
	   "Those deficiencies are deficiencies that, in our view, should not have
occurred," he said.

<HEADLINE> Mass. Lieutenant Gov. Apologizes  </HEADLINE>
   By JEAN McMILLAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- Lt. Gov. Jane Swift apologized Wednesday for asking state
workers to baby-sit her child and catching a ride home in a state police
helicopter.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Maybe I should have come to this conclusion earlier, but I'm willing to
accept responsibility for my action and to say when I've been wrong,'' Swift
said. ``I'm still learning quite a few things about being a mother and even more
about being a lieutenant governor.''
</P>
<P>
	   She said she would ask the state's Ethics Commission to review whether she
abused her office by using a state police helicopter to leave a conference for
her home. She said her daughter had pneumonia and she should have called in
sick.
</P>
<P>
	   She also said she would cooperate if the commission chose to review her use
of staff to watch her 14-month-old daughter, Elizabeth. Swift has defended it by
saying the workers were not on state time and were old friends of hers who
volunteered.
</P>
<P>
	   The Boston Herald reported Wednesday that two aides who helped baby-sit had
received promotions and pay raises. Swift said that was unrelated.
</P>
<P>
	   House Speaker Thomas Finneran said Wednesday he was not troubled by Swift's
use of the helicopter if it was related to official duties.
</P>
<P>
	   As to the personal use of staff, he said: ``I'm confident that the
lieutenant governor will find a way to address it in a timely fashion. I hope
it's an isolated incident.''

<HEADLINE> Report: With some setbacks, state stays with teacher education  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - New York education officials have backtracked on
some tougher teacher education, certification and continuing education standards
they adopted in 1998, a new evaluation says.
<P>
	   A report card on New York teachers by Education Week magazine out Wednesday
gave the state an "A" for standards and accountability, but a "C-plus" on
improving teacher quality and a "D-plus" on school climate.
</P>
<P>
	   School climate is measured by such things as class size and the level of
parental involvement, Education Week editors said. Teacher quality is measured
by the number of teachers working in their field of study and individual teacher
assessments.
</P>
<P>
	   While noting some backsliding over the past two years, Education Week
concluded that in many respects, New York "policymakers are largely sticking to
the game plan the Regents adopted in mid-1998 for reworking the state's approach
to teacher preparation, certification and continuing education."
</P>
<P>
	   State education officials say the discrepancies noted in the report largely
involve their narrowing the focus on a broad range of proposed revisions
intended to improve teacher training and education.
</P>
<P>
	   "Whenever you bring a policy to life there are all kinds of adjustments and
compromises that are made," state Education Commissioner Richard Mills said.
"Much of that has to do with the fact that the Regents never propose things
without listening to a number of different ideas or voices."
</P>
<P>
	   According to Education Week, there's been a major shift in the state's
thinking on tenure standards.
</P>
<P>
	   A recent state policy would have given beginning teachers only two years to
earn a master's degree in order to keep teaching.
</P>
<P>
	   But the latest proposal, which the state Board of Regents is expected to act
on this year, would effectively extend that period to three years.
</P>
<P>
	   "The state's decision is an acknowledgment that for many people it is
financially impossible to get a masters' degree as a beginning teacher," Philip
Ellis, manager of educational services with the New York State United Teachers
union, said. "It's particularly tough if those young teachers are working on a
full-time basis because at this time they should really be trying to get
acclimated to the job."
</P>
<P>
	   Mills said the Regents' ultimate goal is to employ teachers who are fluent
in the subjects they are instructing, plus those having a broad range of
experience and the ability to teach students with diverse needs.
</P>
<P>
	   Currently, the state gives beginning teachers five years to earn a master's
degree.
</P>
<P>
	   Other controversial proposals included those which effectively narrowed the
number of grades that an educator is licensed to teach in New York. Now, the
state has two basic types of certification for teachers in regular education:
pre-kindergarten through sixth grade and seventh grade through 12th grade.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the latest proposal before the Board of Regents, those would be
replaced by four certificates: Birth through second grade; first grade through
sixth grade; fifth grade through ninth grade; and seventh grade through 12th
grade.
</P>
<P>
	   "New teachers need to understand the subjects they teach but they also need
to understand how children grow and develop and the Regents are trying to
combine both perspectives in the standards for teachers," Mills said.
</P>
<P>
	   But according to Ellis, the new breakdown might be self defeating.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have concerns that the narrowing of certification areas could
potentially lead to shortages of teachers in some areas, especially the first
certification (birth to second grade)," Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
	   "If a student was going to become a teacher and was concerned about
long-term employment they might look for certification areas with the widest
grade spans, so people may not want to become kindergarten teachers and we may
potentially end up with a shortage of kindergarten teachers.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton tells Letterman she couldn't resist following him  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Quipping that she finally agreed to take the hot seat
next to David Letterman because she Tipper Gore, a nervous Hillary Rodham
Clinton appeared a pretty good match for the late-night host on Wednesday.
<P>
	   The first lady made her first visit to the Late Show, a stop that followed
weeks of the host taking pot shots at Mrs. Clinton over her plan to run for U.S.
Senate in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman's trademark sarcastic wit was never turned on the first lady, and
he even took a moment to laud her for appearing after hearing him joke about her
for weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have to give this woman a tremendous amount of credit for just showing
up," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Confronted with the first lady in the flesh, Letterman started by lobbing
her a softball, asking her to "tell us about yourself."
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton smiled and told Letterman she grew up in the Midwest - as he
did - has a mother named Dorothy - as he does - and just couldn't resist the
temptation to follow him to New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton actually made a joke at Letterman's expense, when he was asking
her about her new home in Chappaqua.
</P>
<P>
	   "Every idiot in the universe is going to drive by honking now," Letterman
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Was that you?" Mrs. Clinton asked.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman has made a running gag of Mrs. Clinton, calling her a carpetbagger
from Arkansas seeking political opportunity in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton's likely opponent in the U.S. Senate race, Republican New York
City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, has been on the show 14 times, chatting up Letterman
about the Yankees, Mrs. Clinton and life in New York. He even got some laughs in
a few comedy skits.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton admitted to being "just a little" nervous, but told Letterman:
"I knew if I was going to run for Senate, I was going to have to come and sit in
this chair and talk to the big guy."
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani's name came up during the interview, as Letterman asked Mrs.
Clinton what she thought of the mayor and if he had the temperament to be a
senator.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's done a lot of stuff as mayor but I think being senator is a different
kind of job. A senator can't go arrest a homeless person," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   She aced Letterman's New York quiz, correctly identifying the state bird
(bluebird) and the state tree (sugar maple).
</P>
<P>
	   Her top 10 reasons for appearing on the show included "I lost a bet with
Tipper" and "If Dan Quayle did it, how hard could it be?"
</P>
<P>
	   The show was to air Wednesday night at 11:30 EST.

<HEADLINE> Former Principal Admits Embezzling  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BEDFORD, Mass. (AP) -- A former elementary school principal who was
sentenced Wednesday admitted stealing $20,000 in student funds she used to
support a gambling habit, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cynthia Mello, 61, was sentenced to two years probation and counseling for a
gambling addiction after pleading guilty Wednesday to charges of forgery and
larceny.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Mello also was ordered to repay the school. The money will be given to a
scholarship fund.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors said that while Mello was principal from 1986 to 1997 she
developed an aggressive fund-raising program, purportedly to raise money for
workbooks, science projects, school plays and field trips. Prosecutors said she
instead used the money to buy lottery tickets and play casino slot machines.

<HEADLINE> Study supports ethanol plant in New Jersey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A consulting firm hired by the New Jersey Farm
Bureau says it would make economic sense to build an $18 million facility in the
state to convert field corn into fuel.
<P>
	   AUS Consultants Inc., of Moorestown, was commissioned last summer to
determine whether it would be feasible to build an ethanol plant in New Jersey -
the first in the Northeast. The report was completed in December, and The
Associated Press obtained a copy last week.
</P>
<P>
	   The preliminary plan has intrigued farmers, gasoline marketers, government
officials and environmentalists who say ethanol is a cleaner gasoline additive
than widely-used MTBE. A follow-up study is expected to project operating costs
and potential profits.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's pretty critical" for the survival of corn farmers, said Steve
Jany, a West Windsor grain farmer. "An ethanol production plant would pay a
little more than the market."
</P>
<P>
	   Farmers earn between $2.45 and $2.55 on a bushel of field corn. An ethanol
plant would pay about 10 cents less per bushel, but farmers would save the
30-cents-per-bushel transportation cost they pay to bring corn to markets in
Lancaster County, Pa., Jany said.
</P>
<P>
	   Proponents say an ethanol production plant also makes environmental sense.
</P>
<P>
	   "Clearly ethanol is a better alternative to other gasoline additives on the
market today," said David Pringle of the New Jersey Environmental Federation.
MTBE, a methanol-based gasoline additive, dominates the market; however, a
federal panel has recommended that it be phased out over four years because it
contaminates groundwater.
</P>
<P>
	   The additives, called oxygenates, increase the oxygen mix in engine
combustion, reducing the emissions of poisonous carbon monoxide.
</P>
<P>
	   Pringle said he would not support an ethanol production plant if it replaced
the development of technologies such as natural gas and electric-powered
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
	   "If this happens in addition to the other alternatives, that would be
progress," Pringle said.
</P>
<P>
	   John Elston, who directs air quality issues for the state Department of
Environmental Protection, said an ethanol plant would support the department's
clean air efforts. There are some environmental concerns with ethanol, such as
the release of organic pollutants during hot summer months. But the problem
could be overcome by vapor recovery systems in new cars or detected by the
state's new emissions test, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "MTBE use may likely drop because of public pressure, but the Clean Air Act
still requires the use of an oxygenate," although it doesn't specify which one
is to be used, said Elston.
</P>
<P>
	   "The substitute may become very important," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Peter Furey, the farm bureau's executive director, noted that 12.4 million
gallons of ethanol was sold in New Jersey in 1997, compared with 3.7 billion
gallons of gasoline containing MTBE. Those figures could be reversed if MTBE is
phased out, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Why not make that additive (ethanol) here, instead of bringing it in from
somewhere else?" Furey said. The study noted that Archer Daniels Midland Co.,
the state's primary supplier of MTBE, spends 7 to 10 cents per gallon to
transport its product from the Midwest to the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
	   Eric Vaughn, president of the Renewable Fuels Association in Washington,
D.C., a lobbying group for the ethanol industry, said it's just a matter of time
before the demand for ethanol in the Northeast requires a production plant in
the region.
</P>
<P>
	   There are currently 55 ethanol plants in the nation, primarily in the
Midwest, according to his group.
</P>
<P>
	   "If it's readily available and if it makes sense to use it, we would use
it," said Jerry Davis, a spokesman for Philadelphia-based Sunoco Inc. The
company uses MTBE-blended gasoline in the Northeast states and ethanol in the
Midwest.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal government provides a tax reduction up to 5.4 cents per gallon
for gasoline marketers that use ethanol-blended gasoline.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not a handout to the farmers," said Jim Etsch, president of Grain and
Forage Producers of New Jersey, which represents about 2,300 farmers in New
Jersey. "It's a way for them to create a new market."
</P>
<P>
	   Industry experts say the proposed facility would produce 10 million gallons
of ethanol a year. That would require 3.8 million bushels of corn - about 40
percent of New Jersey's annual production of field corn. It would generate up to
35 new jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   The state grows enough corn to support a small-scale ethanol plant,
according to the study.
</P>
<P>
	   "The biggest challenge is raising the equity to get the plant built," said
Kate A. Smith, an author of the study. "If they can raise that, it appears the
economics are favorable."
</P>
<P>
	   Smith said the facility should be run by a farmer-owned cooperative, and
possibly be built near the Burlington County Resource Recovery Complex in
Columbus. The plant could be fueled with methane gas from the landfill,
supporters say.
</P>
<P>
	   Ralph Shrom, a spokesman for the Burlington County freeholders, said county
officials have not seen the study, but would be interested in hearing more about
the plan.
</P>
<P>
	   The cooperative would require a $12,500 investment from 392 farmers, Smith
said. Many cash-strapped farmers, however, could not afford that. Several
supporters said a public-private partnership would be critical in raising money
for the project.
</P>
<P>
	   "From a policy perspective, certainly this looks good," said Rob Young of
the New Jersey Commerce and Economic Development Growth Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission has low-cost loans available for ventures that create
environmental businesses and those that provide new markets for agricultural
products. This venture would fall under both categories, Young said.

<HEADLINE> USDA: Meat Labeling Could Cost  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Requiring meat to be labeled with the country of origin
could raise costs for consumers and there's no proof it would help U.S.
livestock producers, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   In a study requested by Congress, USDA said that mandatory labeling also
could hurt U.S. meat exports if foreign countries impose a similar requirement.
</P>
<P>
	   Some American producers have been pushing for such labeling as a way to curb
imports of Canadian cattle.
</P>
<P>
	   USDA did not put a price tag on a labeling law. The labels themselves could
cost anywhere from $500,000 to $8 million, depending on what cuts of meat the
law applied to. But processors also would have to segregate meat that enters the
country to make sure it's labeled properly, and the cost of doing that ``is
unknown, but could be significant,'' the report said. There would be additional
costs to USDA to enforce the law.
</P>
<P>
	   The department also found no evidence that consumers are willing to pay
higher prices to know where the meat they are buying comes from.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To the contrary, if consumers do distinguish goods depending on their
country of origin, strong incentive exists for industries to act without
government intervention,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meatpackers claim that labeling meat could cost the industry $1 billion a
year. About 10 percent of the beef that Americans eat is imported.

<HEADLINE> Bradley defends letter on behalf of New Jersey company  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Bill Bradley on Wednesday dismissed as "not a big
deal" a letter he wrote in 1994 on behalf of a New Jersey company whose officers
had donated money to his Senate campaign account.
<P>
	   Bradley, who represented New Jersey, said he didn't think it was "wrong at
all" to urge the Commerce Department to give "fair treatment" to Sigma Corp. of
Cream Ridge, N.J.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's president, Victor Pais, said Bradley "did nothing other than
just write a routine letter" that was unrelated to political donations made 15
months earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   But the existence of the letter, first reported in Wednesday's Boston Globe,
put Bradley on the defensive hours before was to detail his criticisms of the
campaign finance system in general.
</P>
<P>
	   Although all candidates were invited, Bradley was the only presidential
candidate who attended an evening campaign finance forum in Manchester, N.H.,
co-sponsored by Common Cause, which supports overhauling federal campaign
finance laws.
</P>
<P>
	   At the forum, Bradley repeated his call for campaign finance changes and
promised to be a president "who is prepared to put his clout on the line in
order to liberate our democracy from the tentacles of money." He said he has
been more committed to the issue than Vice President Al Gore, his rival for the
Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   In questioning Bradley, an audience member confused Gore and GOP
front-runner George W. Bush. "You can get those two mixed up, I know," Bradley
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley had invited scrutiny of his Senate letter-writing record days
earlier, after questions were raised about letters written by Republican
presidential candidate Sen. John McCain on behalf of a major contributor.
Bradley said at the time that his policy during his 18 years in the Senate was
not to "intervene in regulatory matters."
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about the Sigma letter in Iowa on Wednesday, Bradley maintained that
writing letters to regulators "wasn't a practice" and that the discovery of one
or two such letters does not undermine his general policy.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think it's wrong at all," he said about the 1994 letter. "What am I
going to say to a New Jersey company - 'No, I'm not going to write on your
behalf and ask for a decision to be made'?"
</P>
<P>
	   His spokeswoman, Kristen Ludecke added, "This is communicating on behalf of
a constituent and helping them navigate the bureaucracy."
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Al Gore declined to comment on the letter. Asked whether he
wrote similar ones as a senator from Tennessee, Gore said: "I've never claimed
not to have helped my constituents and my state and my congressional district."
</P>
<P>
	   Sigma, which manufactures industrial pipe fittings, appealed a 1992 decision
by the International Trade Commission to impose a 127 percent duty on exports to
the United States by China National Metal Products. Sigma, which imports and
distributes water pipe fittings made by the Chinese company, protested the duty.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Court of International Trade returned the case to the Commerce
Department in June 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   Days later, Bradley wrote to then-Commerce Secretary Ron Brown: "Sigma has
now been denied access to its CDIW fittings, a critical part of its product
line, for over two years. It only seems right that your department do its best
to ensure that this case not drag out any longer than necessary."
</P>
<P>
	   In 1993, company president Pais and vice president Mark Abrams each had
donated $500 to Bradley's Senate campaign account.
</P>
<P>
	   Pais said Wednesday that Abrams was interested in politics and that both men
made campaign contributions, "from time to time, not anything extensive." He
said the donations had nothing to do with the company's decision to seek
Bradley's help.
</P>
<P>
	   Pais said Sigma sought a meeting with Bradley in 1994, but had to settle for
a letter after Bradley's staff said the senator was too busy.
</P>
<P>
	   Pais said Bradley's letter had no effect on the case, which the company
ultimately won in court.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wants Soft-Money Summit  </HEADLINE>
   By MARC HUMBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign manager Wednesday
invited his counterpart on Rudolph Giuliani's political team to negotiate a
mutual ban on the use of unlimited soft-money contributions in their expected
Senate race.
</P>
<P>
	   But Giuliani campaign chief Bruce Teitelbaum, in a letter to Clinton
campaign manager Bill de Blasio, said that before any such negotiations could
take place, the first lady would have to refund such money already spent on her
behalf.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You should also determine how much soft money you have already raised and
publicly declare that none of that money will be used to benefit the Clinton
campaign in any way,'' wrote the aide to the Republican mayor of New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   Trading letters, de Blasio criticized Giuliani's fund-raising activities and
said ``we are disappointed that you are apparently rejecting our offer to
meet.''
</P>
<P>
	   Thus far, the national Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has raised
several hundred thousand dollars in soft-money donations aimed at helping Mrs.
Clinton's campaign in New York. It also spent more than $200,000 to finance
television ads across upstate New York late last year promoting the first lady.
</P>
<P>
	   Under fire for her use of soft money, Mrs. Clinton began pressing Giuliani
last year to agree to a ban on the use of such funding and to disavow
third-party advocacy advertising in the race to succeed Democratic Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, who is retiring.
</P>
<P>
	   While Giuliani has not been actively raising soft money for the Senate race,
he has not ruled out using such funds.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to demanding that Mrs. Clinton pay the cost of the DSCC-financed
ads from her campaign account, Teitelbaum said ``it would also be useful if we
could agree on an ironclad, verifiable method of accountability to ensure that
any agreement we reach will be honored throughout the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
	   Under federal rules, Senate candidates can accept no more than $2,000 from
individual contributors to spend on their races. But those same contributors can
give unlimited money to political committees such as the DSCC that can then use
it to promote a candidate, as long as they don't directly advocate voting for
that candidate.

<HEADLINE> GOP Showcases Its Web Presence  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- National Republicans showcased new technology
Wednesday that will boost its presence on the Internet and possibly energize its
activists.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, the Republican National Committee becomes an Internet service
provider, offering direct access to the Net. The service will come with
customized Web pages providing updates on GOP developments, e-mail, chat rooms,
an ``anti-smut filter'' and ``unbiased reporting.''
</P>
<P>
	   An advertisement says the service targets ``people who want freedom FROM the
press.''
</P>
<P>
	   The RNC also began a separate service Wednesday that will let Web users
track Republican events nationally and in their neighborhoods. The service,
GOPlanit, is a calendar that also will alert users to nonpolitical events of
interest to them, and allows them to log personal events.
</P>
<P>
	   The Internet initiatives are part of an effort begun several months ago by
RNC Chairman Jim Nicholson to more aggressively use the Internet to promote the
party.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have recognized over the last 120 days that it's a new world where you
are digital or die,'' Nicholson said in opening the RNC's winter meeting here.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are trying to enhance participation in the political process,'' he
said. ``This gives us a wonderful capability ... to really stimulate people, and
to communicate with them without going through the filter of the news media.''
</P>
<P>
	   The party also announced that its national convention in Philadelphia in
August will be the first such political gathering broadcast in high-definition
television, which delivers substantially crisper images than traditional TV.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats also are using technology to spread their message.
</P>
<P>
	   The Democratic National Committee recently created a ``George W. Bush Stump
Speech Search Engine'' to underscore its contention that Bush falls back on his
standard address when pressed on almost any subject. By entering phrases from a
Bush appearance, users can count how many times he has used the statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The party will broadcast its national convention on the Web, as it did in
1996, and is considering an HDTV transmission, said Jenny Backus, a party
spokeswoman.

	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Donna
Shalala and Gov. Jeanne Shaheen praised Vice President Al Gore's health care
plan Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The pair toured Child Health Services, which provides health care and other
help to low-income families, before describing why they believe Gore's plan to
expand insurance coverage to all children is good for New Hampshire and the
country.
</P>
<P>
	   Shaheen said the plan fits with New Hampshire's history of building on
successful programs instead of making radical changes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think Al Gore's approach to health care is reasoned, it builds on what
we know already works and provides changes where needed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Shalala criticized Bill Bradley, Gore's rival for the Democratic
presidential nomination, for proposing to eliminate Medicaid and to give people
subsidies to buy health insurance or opt into the system that covers federal
employees.
</P>
<P>
	   She said that approach would hurt the disabled and others who depend on
Medicaid programs tailored to their needs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is a fundamental difference between giving people money to go out
and buy health insurance and making sure quality health care plans are
available,'' she said.

	   PHOENIX (AP) -- Former first lady Barbara Bush on Wednesday submitted the
forms that her son, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, needs to run in the Arizona
Republican presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can imagine the pleasure a mother feels when she files papers for her
son to run for president of the United States,'' Mrs. Bush said after turning in
the forms at the Secretary of State's Office.
</P>
<P>
	   She was joined by Gov. Jane Hull, who chairs Bush's campaign in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Bush said she was amazed at the number of people who have contributed
more than $67 million to his campaign. His fund raising is unmatched by any
previous campaign, including those of his father, former President Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We would have died for that,'' she said.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- College students don't have a high level of interest in
politics or voting, a new poll suggests, but they have a considerable interest
in volunteering for charity work and other civic interests.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it paints a very different portrait of college students than is
commonly assumed -- that they are alienated, self-absorbed and cynical about
politics,'' said Mark Mellman, who conducted the poll for the Panetta Institute,
a Seaside, Calif.-based organization that studies the involvement of young
people in public life.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In reality, this poll demonstrates they are public-spirited, civic-minded
and less cynical about politics than the population as a whole. Their big doubt
is whether politics is relevant to their lives and to the issues about which
they care,'' Mellman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Two-thirds of the students said they didn't vote in 1998 and only a fourth
said they follow politics most of the time.
</P>
<P>
	   Almost two-thirds said they likely will spend part of their careers working
for a nonprofit, charitable organization and four-out-of-10 said it was not
likely.
</P>
<P>
	   About half said work in public service was likely, while four-out-of-10 said
it was not. Only one in five said they were interested in spending part of their
career in politics.
</P>
<P>
	   The national survey of 800 college students was taken in November and has an
error margin of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> With primaries drawing closer, airwaves get sharper  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - So much for the high road.
<P>
	   Steve Forbes is filling airwaves with ads that go after George W. Bush on
taxes. Bush is bristling back. Orrin Hatch is airing a 28-minute denunciation of
President Clinton. Interest groups are taking their agendas to the airwaves,
slamming candidates who don't agree with them.
</P>
<P>
	   And Al Gore, who promised Wednesday to run a positive campaign, is readying
an ad that at least subtly jabs Bill Bradley on farm policy, suggesting the vice
president is the lone candidate who cares about farmers.
</P>
<P>
	   Voters say they want a positive discussion of issues, and early ads have
been mostly positive. But with just 12 days until the first votes are cast, the
campaign for president was starting to take a nastier turn.
</P>
<P>
	   "When you get behind, you get desperate to try to move the (poll) numbers,
and you're willing to try attacks," said Bill Benoit, who studies political
advertising at the University of Missouri. "The fact that voters say they don't
like negative ads doesn't mean they don't work."
</P>
<P>
	   Fearing a backlash, candidates promise to stay positive.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't believe in negative campaigning," Bush told reporters Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Just days ago, his campaign was taping footage of people on the street,
including some criticizing John McCain's tax plan with prompting from the Bush
team. Bush aides said the footage was not turned into an ad and a decision had
not been made about whether to run a critical spot. Then Bush and McCain agreed
during a debate to forgo negative ads.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's campaign put the footage on the shelf. But a college student who was
filmed, Heidi Quigley, wasn't happy about being coached to poke at McCain, and
she defected to the Arizona senator's camp.
</P>
<P>
	   That left Bush aides pedaling backward, saying they were simply preparing in
case McCain went negative first. "There is no ad, so there is no issue," said
Mark McKinnon, Bush's media adviser.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about the situation Wednesday, Bush said, "The ad will not run." He
added, "I'm going to treat my friend and opponent with respect."
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's campaign didn't buy the Bush line. "Taping a negative ad and then
promising not to run it is the high-tech version of smoking pot without
inhaling," said Dan Schnur, a McCain spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   Another GOP rival, Steve Forbes, is flooding Iowa airwaves with an ad
accusing Bush of breaking a Texas promise not to support tax hikes. In the ad,
an anti-tax activist accuses Bush of "a record of broken promises" on taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, Bush supported a tax-cut bill that included some increases to the
sales tax, which critics say was a violation of his no-new-taxes pledge, made in
1994.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush is responding. In a new ad planned for Iowa, Bush promises to run a
campaign free of "cynical and negative politics." He also says, without naming
Forbes, that "my opponent has chosen to run a negative campaign," advisers said.
</P>
<P>
	   He's hoping Iowa voters will recall how Forbes used a barrage of negative
ads to weaken eventual nominee Bob Dole during the 1996 primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   The Democratic jousting over the airwaves is more subtle.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore is preparing a TV ad for Iowa in which a home state senator, Tom
Harkin, calls the vice president the only candidate who really cares about
farmers. Like other ads, it will not mention Bradley by name.
</P>
<P>
	   But Iowa voters are sure to get the message. In other ads, Gore declares he
is the "only Democrat" who will protect Medicaid and Medicare and the "only
Democrat" who has made education a priority.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Gore is promising to stay positive.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think that people want to know how you can make this a better country,
not how you can attack somebody else," he said Wednesday in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's ads make similar, subtle contrasts with Gore. In one, he says that
"people" accuse him of offering risky ideas. Those "people" are the vice
president and his allies.
</P>
<P>
	   In the same ad, Bradley declares the "real risk" is in doing nothing about
gun control, child poverty and the uninsured. Bradley says the "do nothing" tag
wasn't intended for Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   While candidates fear that attacking their opponents will backfire, outside
groups regularly do it.
</P>
<P>
	   An abortion rights group recently ran ads saying Bush poses a "grave risk"
to legal abortion. The Sierra Club has its own ads accusing the Texas governor
of doing little for the environment. McCain has been hit in ads by anti-tax
activists and anti-abortion groups.
</P>
<P>
	   One ad feeds on another, and TV viewers should expect plenty more this year
from groups of all political stripes, said Larry Sabato, a political scientist
at the University of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a matter of keeping up with the Joneses," he said. "If some of your
competitor interest groups are airing ads you want to get out there, too."

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Appears on Letterman  </HEADLINE>
   By DEEPTI HAJELA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Quipping that she finally agreed to take the hot seat next
to David Letterman because she lost a bet with Tipper Gore, a nervous Hillary
Rodham Clinton was a pretty good match for the late-night host on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady made her first visit to the ``Late Show,'' after the host had
spent weeks making a running gag of her plan to run for Senate in New York.
Letterman has called Mrs. Clinton a carpetbagger from Arkansas seeking political
opportunity in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Confronted with the first lady in the flesh, Letterman at first set aside
his trademark sarcasm and lobbed her a softball, asking her to ``tell us about
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton smirked and told Letterman she grew up in the Midwest -- as he
did -- has a mother named Dorothy -- as he does -- and just couldn't resist the
temptation to follow him to New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton admitted to being ``just a little'' nervous, but told
Letterman: ``I knew if I was going to run for Senate, I was going to have to
come and sit in this chair and talk to the big guy.''
</P>
<P>
	   She took a shot at Letterman when he asked her about her new home in
Chappaqua.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every idiot in the universe is going to drive by honking now,'' Letterman
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Was that you?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
	   She aced Letterman's New York quiz, correctly identifying the state bird
(bluebird) and the state tree (sugar maple).
</P>
<P>
	   Her top 10 reasons for appearing on the show included: ``I lost a bet with
Tipper'' and ``If Dan Quayle did it, how hard could it be?''
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton's likely Senate opponent, Republican New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, has been on the show 14 times, chatting up Letterman about the
New York Yankees, Mrs. Clinton and life in New York. He's even gotten some
laughs in a few comedy skits.

<HEADLINE> White House Earmarks Cancer Money  </HEADLINE>
   By KAREN GULLO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House wants to spend $27 million to develop
blood tests and other techniques for measuring toxic substances in humans. The
money also would be used to help communities use the tests to investigate
unusually high cancer rates or chemical accidents.
</P>
<P>
	   The funds, to be included in President Clinton's 2001 budget, would more
than double what the government spent last year to develop ways of measuring
toxic exposure in humans. Officials say the tests are needed to study the link
between chemicals and disease and to identify regions of the country where
Americans are exposed cancer-causing substances.
</P>
<P>
	   An administration plan to be announced Thursday aims to strengthen the
government's ability to study environmental causes of cancer and other diseases
and assist public health officials investigating unusually high cancer rates or
chemical accidents.
</P>
<P>
	   If funds are approved by Congress, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention plan to test thousands of people and make the tests available to
state and local health officials, said Dr. Jeffrey Koplan, CDC director.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have currently in a more experimental mode tests for a wide variety of
toxins in the human body,'' said Koplan. ``This will move the capability of
doing these tests out into the community.''
</P>
<P>
	   The tests could be used in studies of so-called cancer clusters -- places
where a higher-than-normal number of people who live or work in the same place
contract cancer. The tests could also be used to measure toxic exposures from
chemical spills or accidents.
</P>
<P>
	   The CDC's Environmental Health Lab, which develops such tests, has already
conducted studies that link pesticide exposure to breast cancer and PCBs to
non-Hodgkins lymphoma. It also does a national survey that tracks lead exposure
in children.
</P>
<P>
	   But the CDC wants to develop tests that can withstand the rigors of field
work so that communities can routinely monitor people for exposure to over 100
potentially toxic substances and, in the case of chemical accidents, quickly
determine whether people were exposed to dangerous poisons.
</P>
<P>
	   Right now there are few tests for measuring a wide variety of toxic
chemicals in humans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The lab is developing ways to look for dozens or hundreds of chemicals in
just a teaspoon of blood,'' said Dr. Richard Jackson, director of the CDC's
center for environmental health. ``The CDC wants to take them from the research
lab to the country health officer who is dealing with a cancer cluster or a
toxic spill.''

<HEADLINE> Mexican Opposition Founder Quits  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A founder of the opposition Democratic Revolution Party
on Wednesday formally resigned from the party, which said he was fired for lack
of discipline.
</P>
<P>
	   The resignation of Porfirio Munoz Ledo, who is seeking the presidency with
another party, is widely seen as the result of his losing a power struggle with
the Democratic Revolution Party's most prominent figure, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas.
Cardenas is a three-time presidential candidate and was recently mayor of Mexico
City.
</P>
<P>
	   The two men haven't spoken to each other since Munoz Ledo three months ago
registered as a candidate in July 2 presidential elections under the banner of
the tiny Party of the Authentic Revolution. That group broke away in the 1940s
from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, but has never posed a
serious threat to it.
</P>
<P>
	   Cardenas and Munoz Ledo themselves are former PRI leaders who quit in 1987.
Munoz Ledo backed Cardenas' 1988 presidential campaign and the two helped found
the Democratic Revolution Party out of the alliance of leftist parties that
formed around that campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   In announcing his resignation Wednesday, Munoz Ledo predicted his followers
will leave the party ``in droves'' in coming months because its leadership has
become ``frivolous.''

<HEADLINE> China Still Detains U.S. Librarian  </HEADLINE>
   By RENEE SCHOOF Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEIJING (AP) -- More than 100 scholars from around the world petitioned
Chinese leaders Wednesday to free a Pennsylvania librarian who has been detained
for five months and charged with supplying intelligence to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
	   Song Yongyi, a librarian at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pa., and an
authority on the history and documents of the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, was
detained with his wife Aug. 7 while in China collecting old newspapers.
</P>
<P>
	   Scholars of the Cultural Revolution rely on such documents for their
research, according to the petition, which was to be sent to President Jiang
Zemin and other government leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Continued prosecution of this case will make it impossible for foreign
scholars or Chinese scholars associated with foreign universities to conduct
research in open sources in China with the confidence that they will be safe
from criminal prosecution,'' the petition said.
</P>
<P>
	   Song, who was born in China and spent five years in prison during the
Cultural Revolution, was charged Dec. 24 with ``purchasing or illegally
supplying intelligence for people outside the territory of China.''
</P>
<P>
	   Security officials accused Song of having secret documents, said his wife,
Helen Yao, who was detained for three months and then returned to their home in
Carlisle, about 100 miles west of Philadelphia. But she said that according to
her husband, all the documents had all been published in newspapers and other
open sources.
</P>
<P>
	   China officially says revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung created a ``great
disaster'' when he unleashed chaos to purge his enemies and stir up
revolutionary zeal during the Cultural Revolution, the 10-year political
movement in which millions were persecuted, jailed and killed. But officials
also say that Mao was a great revolutionary who made some mistakes only late in
life.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cultural Revolution remains extremely sensitive in China. Fearing
erosion of its authority, Beijing's communist government has never allowed a
public debate about Mao's and other leaders' errors.
</P>
<P>
	   The petition was signed by 101 historians, political scientists and other
scholars in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia and even Chinese-ruled
Hong Kong. As more signatures are collected they also will be sent to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
	   Another petition has garnered more than 2,000 signatures from Dickinson
students and faculty members, shoppers in stores where merchants have posted it
and others who have signed an online version at the college's Web site.
</P>
<P>
	   Like millions of other Chinese, Song suffered in the Cultural Revolution. In
1971 he was labeled a ``counterrevolutionary'' for joining a book club with four
other people and spent five years in prison under harsh conditions. He was later
exonerated, but, the petition says, ``still bears the scars of beatings from
that terrible experience.''
</P>
<P>
	   Song is a permanent resident of the United States and had planned to become
a citizen in September. He has been a librarian at Dickinson College since 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Song is not accused of spying, a charge covered under a different section of
Chinese law, said Arlette Ladugui, a researcher with Amnesty International. The
``secrets'' or ``intelligence'' he is accused of gathering could be anything in
China from political gossip to harmless economic information to classified
official documents, many of which circulate widely in China, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The law is so vague that the authorities can do anything they want with
it,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Examiner Said To Have Few Offers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Five months after Hearst Corp. announced plans to buy
the San Francisco Chronicle, the company said in court papers that it has found
"little or no interest" in the sale of its own paper, the San Francisco
Examiner.
</P>
<P>
	   Hearst denied allegations in an antitrust suit that its attempt to sell the
afternoon newspaper was a sham intended to fail.
</P>
<P>
	   The statements were contained in papers filed by the publisher's lawyer
seeking dismissal of the suit by Clint Reilly, an unsuccessful candidate for
mayor in November.
</P>
<P>
	   The suit, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court, accused Hearst of trying to
monopolize the daily newspaper market in San Francisco by acquiring the
Examiner's competitor. It sought a court order barring the sale.
</P>
<P>
	   Hearst announced in August that it would buy the morning Chronicle for a
reported $660 million and would seek a buyer for its afternoon Examiner. The two
papers will be merged if no buyer can be found, the company said.

<HEADLINE> Whitman steered away from controversy in feel-good State of State  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - For most of her time in Trenton, Gov. Christie
Whitman has gone for bold strokes during her State of the State address.
<P>
	   In past years, there were tax cuts, headline-grabbing proposals, and
populist proposals that made lawmakers squirm. Last year, she offered a property
tax rebate.
</P>
<P>
	   But this year's address, Whitman's sixth, steered away from big controversy,
painting a positive picture of the Garden State and pushing apple pie issues
such as luring more high-tech businesses to New Jersey. Whitman may get some
steam from developers about her plan to toughen approval standards for sewer
plants, but not much else promises to raise hackles in the state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats say they were intrigued by what Whitman left out of the speech.
The state of the state, she said, was "brimming with promise," but there was not
one word about the biggest state government controversy in the year since her
last speech to the people: racial profiling and the State Police.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman made sure not to add more fuel to the furor over long wait times at
auto inspection stations. She gave a passing mention to school construction and
property taxes, but uttered not one word about how the state will pay for new
road construction.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the speech was designed to be not controversial," said Sen. Bernard
Kenny, D-Hudson. "There were certain things that were not stated, issues that
the governor left unaddressed."
</P>
<P>
	   Assembly Speaker Jack Collins said lawmakers know all about those issues. He
said leaving them out of the speech allowed Whitman the ability to shine the
spotlight on other areas.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's going to be school construction," Collins said. "Everyone knows
that. There's going to be a Transportation Trust Fund. There's going to be
continuing efforts to do something about health care. So all these things are
understood. What I think she was trying to do today was say, 'Hey, look at these
other things in there."'
</P>
<P>
	   What of those other things?
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman did call for a $96 million state effort to lure high-tech companies
to New Jersey. In total, there would be a $165 million commitment, when federal
aid and private dollars are included. There was a $69 million promise to
increase early childhood education aid. Tighter restrictions on the approval
process for sewer plants could stem development, and state workers would get the
bonus of two hours off a month to volunteer at their children's schools.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the plans Whitman outlined include a modest dollar commitment.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's a very modest agenda," said Cliff Zukin, a Rutgers University
political scientist. "It is very incremental, and there are small amounts of
money involved. It does not have the boldness of some of her other State of the
States."
</P>
<P>
	   Zukin said Whitman may be realizing that now, more than ever, she must share
the stage with Collins and Senate President Donald DiFrancesco, both of whom are
considering a run for governor next year.
</P>
<P>
	   Thus, while Whitman may be criticized for taking a more modest road, the
alternative is to watch bolder proposals routinely swatted down by Collins and
DiFrancesco. That occasionally happened in past years when Whitman attempted to
ram through items the two leaders didn't like. The days when Whitman could
simply push through much of her agenda are over.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, Whitman seems to be reaching out to past critics rather than
making new ones. Environmentalists, for example, seemed cautiously pleased by
her green proposals.
</P>
<P>
	   Zukin said Whitman, as a moderate Republican, "is trying to steer the ship
of state safely" with neither the liberal's big push for government solutions
nor the conservative's zeal to slash government.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman's supporters contend she's slain many of the bigger policy beasts in
past years, saying voters no longer raise angry fists over the cost of auto
insurance and that bigger property tax rebates are already locked in.
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, the governor herself talked a lot about preserving her policies,
something she said could have gone by the wayside had she run for the U.S.
Senate this year.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've come too far to see these accomplishments slip away because we rested
on our laurels," Whitman said.

<HEADLINE> Arguments on Grandparent Rights  </HEADLINE>
   By REBECCA SINDERBRAND Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As arguments over grandparent visitation rights were
ending Wednesday inside the Supreme Court, the squabbles outside were just
getting started.
</P>
<P>
	   Small knots of protesters spilled onto the sidewalk outside the court
building and confronted each other verbally, as lawyers and outside
organizations on both sides of the issue took turns repeating the day's court
arguments for waiting reporters and television cameras.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The grandparents and children have needs that have to be considered as
well'' as the parents' wishes, said lawyer Mark Olson, who represents Gary and
Jenifer Troxel, the children's grandparents.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think any of us are in a position to know what's in the best
interest of children. Parents are the ones in that position,'' said Catherine
Smith, attorney for Tommie Granville Wynn, mother of Natalie, 10, and Isabelle,
8.
</P>
<P>
	   Brad Troxel, the couple's son and the girls' father, committed suicide in
1993.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Children have a right to have contact with their grandparents,'' said
Davis Levy, president of the Children's Rights Council, an organization whose
stated goal is to ``demilitarize the divorce process to ensure children remain
in contact with parents and extended family.''
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the Family Research Council handed out a statement which read, in
part, ``In the age of splintered families, the government needs to uphold the
family unit, not break it down by granting unrelated third parties equal access
to children.''
</P>
<P>
	   At least one grandfather standing outside the court agreed with the FRC. ``I
think parents have the right to raise children the way they see fit. As long as
they're fit parents, this is a decision the parents have to make,'' said Carl
Argiroff of Livonia, Mich.
</P>
<P>
	   But there was a large group of very vocal senior citizens on hand who
supported the Troxels. ``If it wasn't for grandparents, the grandkids wouldn't
even be here!'' yelled a man on the edge of the crowd.
</P>
<P>
	   Jenifer Troxel sounded tired as she remarked, ``It's been good to have a day
in court, but I'm glad it's finally over.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. Rejects Old Growth Protection  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- California forestry officials rejected a demand
Wednesday for an immediate halt to old-growth logging made by dozens
environmentalists, including a protester who lived for two years in a redwood
tree.
</P>
<P>
	   The Board of Forestry, as expected, rejected the petition after a day-long
hearing but agreed to set up a committee of environmentalists, timber owners and
others to study the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Julia ``Butterfly'' Hill, who lived on a tarp-covered platform in a redwood
tree 250 miles north of San Francisco until the Pacific Lumber Co. agreed to
spare the tree last month, said current law allows the cutting of ancient trees,
including redwoods, under loopholes and exemptions abused by harvesters.

<HEADLINE> Court Mulls Grandparents' Rights  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- While acknowledging a ``special relationship'' between
grandparents and grandchildren, Supreme Court justices appeared troubled by
state laws that give grandparents broad rights to seek court-ordered visitation
against parents' wishes.
</P>
<P>
	   In an intense debate over an emotionally charged issue, the nation's highest
court on Wednesday assessed two competing values -- a state's desire to promote
children's best interests and parents' right to raise their children free from
government interference.
</P>
<P>
	   The way the justices resolve that conflict, in a decision expected by late
June, could touch every corner of America. Sixty million Americans are
grandparents. So are six of the court's nine members.
</P>
<P>
	   A majority of the justices voiced grave concerns about a Washington state
law that allowed ``any person,'' relative or nonrelative, to win a court-ordered
right to see a child any time such visitation was found to be in a child's best
interest.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Breathtakingly broad,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor called it before
asking one lawyer, ``Do you defend it ... any person, any time?''
</P>
<P>
	   Early in the hourlong session of arguments, Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist asked whether the law might allow a little girl's ``great aunt'' to
``come in and say, 'I want to take her to the movies every Friday.'''
</P>
<P>
	   And Justice Stephen G. Breyer indicated he was not about to favor a law that
would grant visitation rights to ``an accordion player who wants to visit once a
year,'' even if music lessons were in a child's best interest.
</P>
<P>
	   The state law also came under spirited questioning from Justices Antonin
Scalia and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
	   But Breyer also asked about the ``special'' nature of a case involving
grandparents seeking more time with their grandchildren. And Justice David H.
Souter, otherwise hostile to Washington's law, discussed the ``special
relationship'' a grandparent might have with a grandchild.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice John Paul Stevens, at 79 the court's oldest member, asked several
questions focusing on a parent's asserted ``absolute veto'' power over how often
grandparents can see their grandchildren. ``Is there no relief for a
grandparent?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
	   While all 50 states have laws allowing grandparents and others to seek
visitation after divorces or under other circumstances, only a handful of those
laws go as far as Washington's. The state's Supreme Court struck down the law in
late 1998, ruling it violated parents' rights.
</P>
<P>
	   That decision wiped out an Anacortes, Wash., couple's legal right to see
their two granddaughters.
</P>
<P>
	   Gary and Jenifer Troxel, who sat through the court proceeding, seek to
regain the right to see the two girls, 10-year-old Natalie and 8-year-old
Isabelle, more often than their mother, Tommie Granville Wynn, is willing to let
them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The court should balance all the interests,'' Seattle lawyer Mark Olson
argued for the Troxels, emphasizing the importance of letting children ``know
where they come from.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Seattle lawyer Catherine Smith, representing the girls' mother, said the
visitation order the Troxels obtained from a state court violated her client's
``right to make these decisions absent a showing that the children were being
harmed.''
</P>
<P>
	   The ``pernicious effect'' of Washington's invalidated law, Smith said, is a
parent being forced to defend ``a perfectly reasonable decision.... No one
should be brought into court for that kind of suit.''
</P>
<P>
	   The girls' father, Brad Troxel, committed suicide in 1993. He and Tommie
Granville were never married but had two daughters during their relationship.
When they separated, Troxel lived with his parents. The girls regularly visited
their father at the Troxels' home.
</P>
<P>
	   After the suicide, Natalie and Isabelle continued seeing their grandparents
regularly until their mother limited their visits.
</P>
<P>
	   The Troxels went into state court, and two years later were awarded
visitation of one weekend a month, one week during the summer and certain other
days.
</P>
<P>
	   While Granville appealed, she married Kelly Wynn. He then adopted the girls.
</P>
<P>
	   Rehnquist, Stevens, O'Connor, Scalia, Ginsburg and Justice Anthony M.
Kennedy are the court's grandparents. Two others -- Breyer and Justice Clarence
Thomas -- are parents but have no grandchildren. Souter is a bachelor.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas has other relevant experience: he was raised by his grandparents.
</P>
<P>
	   A survey released last week by AARP found about one in nine American
grandparents over the age of 50 helps care for at least one grandchild. The
survey showed that 8 percent provide day care regularly, and 3 percent function
as parents, rearing a grandchild.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Joins Wife in N.Y. Home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. (AP) -- Bringing along his mother-in-law, President Clinton
hopped on an Air Force jet Wednesday and flew to New York to join his wife,
Hillary, at their new home in Chappaqua.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the president's second visit in a week, and this time he'll stay two
nights. Last week he squeezed in one night amid peace talks between Israel and
Syria. Clinton flew here on a two-engine military plane rather than the jumbo
jet he usually flies, although any plane he rides is designated Air Force One.
</P>
<P>
	   He was accompanied by the first lady's mother, Dorothy Rodham.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Clinton joined his wife in unpacking belongings at the house,
where she moved to establish residency for her Senate bid. This time, Clinton
was staying at the house more for convenience's sake, said White House spokesman
Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, he is scheduled to attend a Wall Street conference convened by
Jesse Jackson and decided to take advantage of the house's proximity to New York
City, Lockhart said. Clinton planned to stay overnight in Chappaqua on Thursday
and return to the White House on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``After a very full day in New York, he can actually go to his own home
instead of taking up two floors in some very expensive hotel,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
	   After their first night in the house, Mrs. Clinton said she and her husband
had a lot of unpacking and settling in to do. They have lived either in the
Arkansas governor's mansion or the White House since 1983, and must sort through
17 years' worth of stored possessions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a place where they will make a home,'' Lockhart said. ``I think
the first lady will spend a lot of time there, given what she is doing for the
year, but for the president, this is a place in the future.''
</P>
<P>
	   The spokesman added: ``No, the boxes aren't all unpacked yet.''
</P>
<P>
	   The president has said he plans to live in Chappaqua after he leaves office
in January 2001. He also has said he intends to maintain an apartment at his
presidential library in Little Rock, Ark., and plans to work there regularly.

   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- A newborn girl was in critical condition Wednesday after
being found inside a plastic bag stuffed into a garbage can in a snowy alley.
</P>
<P>
	   The 15-year-old believed to be the mother was taken to the Hennepin County
Medical Center and faces possible criminal charges.

baby crying in a family bathroom. Several hours later, the brothers saw the girl
walk into the alley with a trash bag, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   When their mother returned home, she looked inside the bag at her sons'
urging and found the infant, barely alive.
</P>
<P>
	   The woman began blowing air into the baby's mouth until paramedics arrived.

<HEADLINE> Reno Upholds Cuban Father's Right  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Brushing aside a Florida court ruling, Attorney General
Janet Reno said Wednesday any challenge to the government's decision to return
Elian Gonzalez to his Cuban father must come in federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   To give the 6-year-old boy's Florida relatives time to challenge the
decision, Reno postponed the federal government's Friday deadline for turning
him over for return to Cuba. But initial reaction from the relatives' lawyers
appeared to spurn Reno's suggestion that they argue the case in federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have a (Florida) court order that says the boy stays for now,'' Jose
Garcia-Pedrosa, one of the attorneys, told WTVJ-TV in Miami. ``We have a
subpoena (from a U.S. House committee) that requires him to appear in February.
The boy isn't going anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the attorney general should rethink her position very, very, very
quickly,'' Garcia-Pedrosa said.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno did not give a new deadline or say what steps the federal government
might take next to enforce its decision if the Florida relatives refuse to seek
a federal court ruling. Federal officials have said they have no plans to send
Immigration and Naturalization Service agents to seize the boy.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said the boy's future could best be decided in state
court and he was disappointed by Reno's decision.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I just think it's not a cut-and-dried issue, and I think the tie should go
to Elian, not Cuba,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., said he was pleased the deadline had been pushed
back. He said when Congress returns in two weeks he would push for quick action
on his bill to give Elian immediate U.S. citizenship.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., who issued the congressional subpoena to delay
Elian's departure, said he had written to Reno asking her to explain why this
has to be settled in a federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   Burton added he would be satisfied if Elian gets a fair hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If they send the boy back, I wouldn't like that, but we would live with
that,'' Burton told Fox News on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Leaders of Cuban-American groups that have protested against returning the
boy to Fidel Castro's Cuba doubted federal agents would try to take the boy but
said other steps also could trigger more protests in Miami's streets.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We trust that they will not do that,'' said Ramon Saul Sanchez, head of
Democracy Movement. He called Reno's decision disappointing and said more
protests will occur if the boy's great-uncle, who is seeking custody, doesn't
get his day in court.
</P>
<P>
	   Another Miami protest leader, Jose Basulto, president of Brothers to the
Rescue, said, ``If there is no hearing, be prepared to see massive
demonstrations. We are talking about a build-up of emotions, of years of
political frustration having to do with the foreign policy of the U.S.
especially with (President) Clinton. This child has become a symbol of many
frustrations.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart said Reno has Clinton's backing
in seeking to ensure the case goes through proper judicial channels. Lockhart
reiterated that Cuban officials have been told a nonimmigrant visa would be
expedited for Elian's father should he wish to come to the United States to
press his claim for custody.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's mother, stepfather and others died when their boat capsized as they
fled Cuba. He survived along with two adults.
</P>
<P>
	   Writing to lawyers for the Florida relatives, Reno said a Florida court's
ruling Monday that the boy must remain in the United States until a March 6
hearing ``has no force or effect'' on the Immigration and Naturalization
Service's decision in the case.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The question of who may speak for a 6-year-old child in applying for
admission or asylum is a matter of federal immigration law,'' Reno wrote. The
question of who speaks for the boy ``remains one of federal, not state, law.''
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, a Miami television news crew filmed Elian Tuesday as he made a
comment about his sentiments while playing outside with a friend. But an
airplane was passing overhead, and the boys words, spoken in Spanish, were in
dispute. It was unclear whether he said he wanted to stay in Miami or go home to
Cuba. A family spokesman, Armando Gutierrez, said he didn't know what the boy
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for the family visited Reno here last week to press their argument
that she overrule the INS decision. Weighing their arguments, Reno wrote, ``I am
not currently aware of any basis for reversing ... (that) decision.''
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, Reno added that the federal ruling ``may be challenged, if at all,
only in federal court. We are prepared to litigate in that forum.''
</P>
<P>
	   Reno wrote that INS decided its Jan. 14 deadline for turning the boy over
``should be extended to accommodate any federal court proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
	   Finally, Reno appealed for a quick resolution. ``It is my strong hope that
we can work together to resolve this child's status as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
	   Reno's position won support from David Abraham, a professor of immigration
law at the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Immigration law is an exclusive federal monopoly,'' Abraham said. ``The
judge had no authority to hear this case to begin with, apart from the fact that
her ruling was entirely at odds with Florida law.''
</P>
<P>
	   Miami-Dade County Circuit Judge Rosa Rodriguez' ruling Monday was designed
to give her court time to hear arguments from Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's
great-uncle, for temporary custody.

<HEADLINE> Missing Israeli Airman May Be Alive  </HEADLINE>
   By HUSSEIN DAKROUB Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- The leader of the Hezbollah guerrilla group said
Wednesday that the 14-year-old case of a missing Israeli airman is ``a real
mystery'' and that the group hopes he can be found alive and exchanged for
Lebanese prisoners held by Israel and its allies.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheik Hassan Nasrallah repeated in a television interview previous Hezbollah
assertions that the group continues its efforts to uncover the fate of Ron Arad,
who disappeared in 1986 after his jet was shot down over south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   Nasrallah's comments came hours before the expected release Thursday of
about 25 Lebanese held by Israeli-allied militiamen in south Lebanon and more
than two weeks after five Hezbollah guerrillas were released by Israel -- two
signs of serious efforts to tackle the issue of prisoners and the missing after
the resumption of Syrian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
	   In the interview with Al-Jazeera, a popular Gulf Arabic-language satellite
news channel, Nasrallah said Arad was not in the hands of the Iranians, the
Syrians or Hezbollah, which is waging a guerrilla war against Israeli forces in
southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The case has become a real mystery,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   There has been speculation that Arad may have died in fighting in 1989,
killed by his captors or even escaped.
</P>
<P>
	   Responding to a question whether he thought Arad was still alive, Nasrallah
said: ``The possibility is still there.''
</P>
<P>
	   Arad's jet was shot down during a bombing raid and guerrillas captured him.
</P>
<P>
	   Hezbollah has repeatedly denied any knowledge of his whereabouts. Officials
have said it is in Hezbollah's interest to find him and trade him for Lebanese
guerrillas and other prisoners held in Israel and by Israeli-allied militiamen
in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   There are 16 Lebanese held in Israel as what human rights groups call

<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Jervis Anderson, the writer who chronicled the history of
Harlem and wrote vivid portraits of popular musicians, poets and deal makers as
a staff writer for 30 years at The New Yorker magazine, has died. He was 67.
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson died at his New York apartment sometime between Christmas and New
Year's. His body was discovered last Friday after neighbors noticed mail piling
up. The medical examiner said he died of natural causes.
</P>
<P>
	   Along with his detailed portraits of cultural icons like Nobel Prize-winning
poet Derek Walcott, writer Cornel West and jazz musician Wynton Marsalis,
Anderson was known for his books on civil rights advocate Bayard Rustin and A.
Philip Randolph, a labor and civil rights leader w helped rebuild Harlem. He
also wrote the 1982 book, ``This Was Harlem: A Cultural Portrait, 1900-1950,''
based on a four-part series he wrote for the magazine.
</P>
<P>
	   He joined The New Yorker in 1968 and remained there until his retirement in
1998.
Bob Lemon
</P>
<P>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Bob Lemon, who made the Hall of Fame for a brilliant
pitching career and then managed the New York Yankees to a World Series
championship, died Tuesday. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
	   Lemon was a seven-time 20-game winner with the Cleveland Indians and manager
of the Yankees during their amazing 1978 title run.
</P>
<P>
	   Lemon led the American League in victories three times and won two games in
the 1948 World Series -- the last time the Indians were champions. He finished
with a 207-128 record and was inducted into the Hall in 1976.
</P>
<P>
	   Two years later, Lemon, who also managed for the Kansas City Royals and the
Chicago White Sox, took over the Yankees at midseason when Billy Martin
resigned.
</P>
<P>
	   New York overcame a 14-game deficit, beat Boston in a one-game playoff at
Fenway Park to win the AL East, then defeated the Royals in the AL playoffs
before triumphing over the Los Angeles Dodgers to win its second straight World
Series title.
Solomon Mamaloni
</P>
<P>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Solomon Mamaloni, a former prime minister of the
Pacific island nation of the Solomon Islands who was accused of corruption and
mismanagement, died Tuesday from kidney disease.
</P>
<P>
	   Mamaloni, believed to be in his mid-50s, was opposition leader at the time
of his death and was the Solomon Islands' longest serving politician. He was
prime minister for four separate terms between 1983 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, a secret briefing paper by Australian officials described him as a
``wily'' politician who had bought political support in 1994 with the financial
help from Malaysian logging companies.
</P>
<P>
	   Mamaloni was ousted in late 1997 after a controversy in which he tried to
buy arms from a Singapore supplier.

<P>
	   McFadden exclaimed ``Ring around the collar!'' And ``Pretty shirt!'' as the
parrot's voice in commercials for the laundry detergent in the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
	   McFadden got into show business in 1948 as a singer appearing in nightclubs
and hotels around the country with acts such as the McGuire Sisters and Harry
Belafonte.
</P>

	   In the 1960s, he moved to New York and switched to doing voices and
advertising work, providing voices for commercials for Frankenberry cereal and
Pepperidge Farm foods, among others.

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Dow May Be Sued in Implant Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DETROIT (AP) -- Women opposed to a settlement over silicone breast implants
once made by Dow Corning Co. may sue the company's corporate parents, a judge
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Arthur Spector this week threw out a challenge to an
earlier ruling that opened the way for suits against Midland-based Dow Chemical
Co. and Corning Inc. of Corning, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
	   Spector approved the settlement Nov. 30 after 4 1/2 years of negotiations.
It calls on Dow Corning, a 50-50 joint venture between Dow Chemical and Corning,
to pay out $3.2 billion to settle claims by more than 170,000 women blaming Dow
Corning implants for a wide range of health problems.
</P>
<P>
	   About 94 percent of the 112,774 women who voted on the plan in 1999 approved
it.
</P>
<P>
	   Spector on Dec. 21 issued a ruling saying that women who voted against the
settlement could still sue Dow Chemical and Corning if they chose.
</P>
<P>
	   That ruling was challenged by Dow Chemical and Corning, but in an opinion
dated Monday, Spector said the challenge wrongly assumed that it changed the
terms of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for Dow Chemical and Corning had filed a notice with Spector on Dec.
29. They argued that his Dec. 21 opinion violated the ban on future lawsuits
against those companies, and said they did not consider the settlement
confirmed, said Dow Corning spokesman T. Michael Jackson.

<HEADLINE> Rite Aid Stock Plummets After Delay  </HEADLINE>
    By HOPE YEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Rite Aid Corp.'s shares plummeted 26 percent
Wednesday, as investors reacted to speculation that the New York Stock Exchange
was poised to delist the stock due to the company's delay in releasing financial
reports.
</P>
<P>
	   The NYSE postponed trading for nearly two hours Wednesday morning after
Lehman Brothers analyst Meredith Adler said the exchange was expected to delist
the stock. The NYSE later said it would not delist "at this time," though it was
closely monitoring the situation.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokeswoman for the exchange said it had halted activity after hearing
news of a possible delisting, but declined to comment further. Adler later
retracted her statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Rite Aid shares closed trading at $7.87 1/2 at 5 p.m., down 26 percent from
Tuesday's close.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation's third-largest pharmacy chain announced after the close of
markets Tuesday that it had reached agreement with its lenders on the delay and
planned to seek extensions on Securities and Exchange Commission filings for the
remaining quarterly and annual reports for fiscal year 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Rite Aid's third quarter report for the period ending Nov. 27 was due
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't have any reason to believe we're delisted, and have no indication
that we would be," said senior vice president Karen Rugen. Exchange officials
"hadn't mentioned a word until they called to ask where the delisting headlines
came from."
</P>
<P>
	   The Camp Hill-based chain has been trying to recover after financial woes
sent the company's stock tumbling by more than 80 percent in a year. Former top
executive Martin L. Grass was ousted in October, and a new team led by CEO
Robert Miller has pledged to improve profitability with stricter financial
controls and strategic marketing.
</P>
<P>
	   Rite Aid also has switched auditing firms and a restatement of its earnings
for the past three years was expected to result in a $500 million reduction.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts have said the chain's delay in financial reports may be troubling
in light of December same-store sales figures showing a "poor" 5.9 percent
increase, compared to the double-digit growth of Walgreen's and CVS.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton tells Letterman she couldn't resist following him  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Quipping that she finally agreed to take the hot seat
next to David Letterman because she lost a bet with Tipper Gore, a nervous
Hillary Rodham Clinton appeared a pretty good match for the late-night host on
Wednesday.
<P>
	   The first lady made her first visit to the Late Show, a stop that followed
weeks of the host taking pot shots at Mrs. Clinton over her plan to run for U.S.
Senate in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman's trademark sarcastic wit was never turned on the first lady, and
he even took a moment to laud her for appearing after hearing him joke about her
for weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have to give this woman a tremendous amount of credit for just showing
up," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Confronted with the first lady in the flesh, Letterman started by lobbing
her a softball, asking her to "tell us a little bit about yourself."
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton smiled and told Letterman she grew up in the Midwest - as he
did - has a mother named Dorothy - as he does - and just couldn't resist the
temptation to follow him to New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton actually made a joke at Letterman's expense, when he was asking
her about her new home in Chappaqua.
</P>
<P>
	   "Every idiot in the universe is going to drive by honking now," Letterman
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Was that you?" Mrs. Clinton asked.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman has made a running gag of Mrs. Clinton, calling her a carpetbagger
from Arkansas seeking political opportunity in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton's likely opponent in the U.S. Senate race, Republican New York
City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, has been on the show 14 times, chatting up Letterman
about the Yankees, Mrs. Clinton and life in New York. He even got some laughs in
a few comedy skits.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton admitted to being "just a little" nervous, but told Letterman:
"I knew if I was going to run for Senate, I was going to have to come and sit in
this chair and talk to the big guy."
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani's name came up during the interview, as Letterman asked Mrs.
Clinton what she thought of the mayor and if he had the temperament to be a
senator.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's done a lot of stuff as mayor but I think being senator is a different
kind of job. A senator can't go arrest a homeless person," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   She aced Letterman's New York quiz, correctly identifying the state bird
(bluebird) and the state tree (sugar maple).
</P>
<P>
	   Her top 10 reasons for appearing on the show included "I lost a bet with
Tipper" and "If Dan Quayle did it, how hard could it be?"
</P>
<P>
	   The show was to air Wednesday night at 11:30 EST.

<HEADLINE> Haitians Seek Immigration Equality  </HEADLINE>
   By MILDRADE CHERFILS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Haitian activists staged a mock funeral and protest march
Wednesday to draw attention to disparities in the treatment of Haitian and Cuban
immigrants who seek asylum in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The protesters pointed to the international custody battle over Elian
Gonzalez, a 6-year-old Cuban boy, and contrasted that with the plight of a
pregnant woman whose children were returned to Haiti this month while she
remained in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are asking for fairness, equality and due process,'' said Aude Sicard,
an activist with the Haitian-American Grassroots Coalition. ``Haitian children
are children too.''
</P>
<P>
	   Under U.S. immigration policy, Haitians and others who arrive illegally are
sent back to their country. But the Cuban Readjustment Act of 1966 grants any
Cuban who reaches American soil the right to stay.
</P>
<P>
	   Haitians claim they are routinely sent back to Haiti without being allowed
to request a hearing to determine whether they have a ``credible fear'' of
persecution in their homeland.
</P>
<P>
	   They claim that the return to Haiti of 407 Haitians attempting to enter the
United States illegally on New Year's Day was unfair, especially in light of the
fight to keep Elian after he survived an illegal attempt to reach Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   In honor of the six people who passengers on the boat from Haiti said died
during the journey, the activists staged a mock funeral that was attended by
about 300 in Miami's Little Haiti section. The ceremony was followed by a
candlelight march attended by about 3,000 people.
</P>
<P>
	   Encel Alcime, a 75-year-old retired Miami-Dade County water department
worker, said his fellow Haitian immigrants are treated differently than Cubans
because they are black.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Haitians are taken from the water and sent back right away, which means
that they don't need us here,'' Alcime said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the New Year's trip, Yvena Rhinvil, who is four months pregnant, was one
of four people brought to shore for medical reasons. But her children, ages 8
and 9, were among those sent back to Haiti, where they are living with an aunt.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials said they weren't told Rhinvil's children were with her. ``If
we would have known that she had children on board, we would have brought the
children with her,'' said Coast Guard spokesman Luis Diaz.
</P>
<P>
	   Activists didn't believe it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's a big lie,'' Sicard said. ``All during the trip down back to Haiti,
they thought that their mother had died. This is inhuman.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rhinvil, 33, has passed the ``credible fear'' standard and is applying for
political asylum, a process that can take months.
</P>
<P>
	   Cheryl Little, an attorney with the Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center, who
is representing Rhinvil, wrote to Attorney General Janet Reno and INS
Commissioner Doris Meissner, urging them to reunite the family.
</P>
<P>
	   Immigration and Naturalization Service spokesman Russ Bergeron said
immigration officials were considering the request.

<HEADLINE> Muslims Protest in Jakarta  </HEADLINE>
   By IRWAN FIRDAUS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AMBON, Indonesia (AP) -- Muslims protested outside parliament Wednesday,
threatening to wage holy war against Christians unless the government puts an
end to sectarian violence in Indonesia's eastern islands.
</P>
<P>
	   The demonstrators gathered in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta to protest
Muslim-Christian violence in the Maluku islands, where nearly 30 people have
been killed over the past three days.
</P>
<P>
	   The protest was far smaller than a similar demonstration by some 80,000
Muslims on Friday. President Abdurrahman Wahid has warned he would use force to
prevent Muslim radicals from traveling to the region to take part in the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly 2,000 people have died in a year of sectarian violence in the Maluku
islands, known as the Spice Islands during Dutch colonial rule. The violence has
come amid increasing religious tensions fueled in part by Muslim migration to
the islands, which have long had a Christian majority.
</P>
<P>
	   The worst of the violence in recent days was on Seram island, some 1,600
miles east of Jakarta, where Muslim-Christian clashes in Masohi town left nine
dead and scores injured on Tuesday, said military spokesman Lt. Col. Iwa
Budiman. Soldiers and residents said another seven people were killed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   By Thursday, most of the town was either on fire or destroyed, said resident
Makadava Doran. Hundreds of refugees were hiding in schools and mosques, afraid
to go out into the street, said Maluku military commander Gen. Max Tamaela.
</P>
<P>
	   On Halmahera island in North Maluku, seven people were killed Monday and
five Tuesday, witnesses and newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
	   The military managed to separate the two sides after fighting on Tuesday,
but thousands of people are fleeing the island fearing an increase in the
bloodshed, said Achmad Ali, a noncommissioned officer stationed in the south of
the island.
</P>
<P>
	   On Buru island near the Maluku provincial capital Ambon, the military is
using helicopters to search for thousands of people who have fled into the
jungle in fear of a resurgence of violence, Tamaela said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is a serious lack of food on the island and we want to evacuate them
to Ambon,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, 12 people were found dead in the province of Aceh, which has been
torn by separatist violence and a security crackdown, hospital official Sukri
Tahir said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Aceh, an oil-rich province on the northern tip of Sumatra, is one of several
Indonesian regions where separatists are fighting for independence.
</P>
<P>
	   Guerrillas in the province have been waging a struggle against Indonesian
rule since the mid-1970s. At least 5,000 people have died in the violence during
the past decade.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Rallying for Boy's Return  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- The latest rally Wednesday in Cuba's campaign for the return
of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez featured impassioned speeches, folk music and
children's dance performances -- but no official reaction to the latest legal
maneuvering in the United States in the case.
</P>
<P>
	   With daily legal developments in the United States, Cuban authorities said
privately that official reaction was unlikely until Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   As hundreds of public health workers rallied Wednesday evening to demand the
child's return, Cuba stepped up its national press coverage of Americans who
support Elian's return. The Communist Party reprinted a statement issued this
week by the U.S. National Council of Churches pushing for the boy to be brought
back from Florida and provided wide coverage of protests by Americans in New
York.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest legal move came Wednesday from Attorney General Janet Reno, who
brushed aside a Florida court judge's order that Elian remain with his American
relatives until March 6 so the court can hear arguments from the boy's relatives
in Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   They are seeking temporary custody of Elian, who has been in Florida since
Thanksgiving Day, when he was found floating on an inner tube off the coast. His
mother was lost at sea in an apparent attempt to immigrate illegally to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno said that any challenge to the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service's decision that Elian should be returned to Cuba must come in federal
rather than state court. She said she would allow Elian's Miami relatives to
seek relief in federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, has demanded that his son be returned,
and Elian's relatives in Miami say they can give him a better life off the
communist island.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those at the protest Wednesday was Dr. Evelio Cabezas, head of Cuba's
national organization of gynecology and obstetrics, who noted that all Cuban
women receive specialized care while they are pregnant.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Elian should return to his homeland, which cared for him even before he
was born, and again afterward and will for always,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of the uncertainty over Elian's return, communist leaders have
called on Cubans to continue protesting to press U.S. officials to repatriate
him.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Warns on Chinese Influence  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Pentagon intelligence report says a Chinese foothold
near the Panama Canal though a Hong Kong-based company ``could provide a conduit
for illegal shipments of technology or prohibited items from the West to
China.''
</P>
<P>
	   The newly declassified report, completed last October, says the presence of
the firm Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. at two port facilities in the area also could
facilitate the movement of arms and other prohibited items into the Americas.
</P>
<P>
	   The Washington public interest group Judicial Watch released the report
after obtaining it under the Freedom of Information Act.
</P>
<P>
	   The report came to light as Secretary of State Madeleine Albright planned a
visit Saturday to Panama, where she will confer with President Mireya Moscoso
and assess the transfer of the canal to local control, completed two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Many sections of the three-page report were heavily blacked out. Each of the
four pages was stamped ``SECRET'' but that classification was subsequently
replaced with a new stamp: ``UNCLASSIFIED.''
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about the report, the State Department reaffirmed its view that that
the Hong Kong company's operation of the port facilities ``does not pose a
threat to U.S. national security.''
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman said the government of Panama ``controls all navigation through
the Panama Canal. The Hong Kong company operation in Panama involves loading and
unloading cargo from its port facilities. This function is identical to that of
other cargo firms operating in the world.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Pentagon has issued similar statements about the situation.
</P>
<P>
	   The presence of Hutchison Whampoa has been a continuing source of concern to
conservative members of Congress and some analysts because of its supposed links
to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said, referring to
the Panama Canal, that it would be illogical for China to ``pass up a chance to
acquire a major foothold in one of the world's three major choke points --
especially if it can be done with little cost or risk.''
</P>
<P>
	   According to the Pentagon study, first reported by the Washington Times,
``any potential threat posed by the presence of a pro-Chinese corporate entity
in the Panama Canal zone is indirect.'' It added that it is unlikely that the
Hutchison Whampoa subsidiary carrying out operations at the two ports ``would
overtly sabotage or damage the canal on orders from Beijing, as it would be
contrary to their own financial interests and would undoubtedly elicit an
immediate response from the U.S. and the international community.''
</P>
<P>
	   It added, however, that Hutchison Whampoa's owner, Hong Kong tycoon Li
Ka-shing, has ``extensive business ties in Beijing and has compelling financial
reasons to maintain a good relationship with China's leadership.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hutchison Whampoa has repeatedly disputed that it has any means or desire to
control access to the Panama Canal or that its operations are in any way
directed by anyone in mainland China, where there are no significant
stakeholders in the company.

<HEADLINE> Va. Gov. Wants Separate MLK Holiday  </HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW BARAKAT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Celebrating the lives of two Confederate generals and
Martin Luther King Jr. on the same day is confusing and detracts from their
accomplishments, Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore said Wednesday in proposing in his
State of the Commonwealth speech that the holidays be separated.
</P>
<P>
	   Virginia has been the only state to simultaneously honor Robert E. Lee,
Stonewall Jackson and King, on Lee-Jackson-King Day. The day honored only Lee
and Jackson until 1985 when it was joined by the King holiday, celebrated as a
federal holiday the third Monday in January.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The time has come to enhance these holidays and give them their due
recognition,'' Gilmore said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican governor said King deserves a day to himself and sharing it
with Lee and Jackson is confusing. Jackson and Lee would share a separate day in
their honor, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, the nation's first elected black governor,
said he likes the idea.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It should be separate,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``I endorse it
wholeheartedly. I think it's great.''
</P>
<P>
	   But state Sen. Benjamin J. Lambert III, D-Richmond, was less enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I haven't had any complaints about the three being together,'' said
Lambert, who is black. ``The fiscal impact also has to be taken into
consideration. Once you create these holidays, they're there forever.''

<HEADLINE> Israel Minister Hails Morocco King  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RABAT, Morocco (AP) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy hailed Morocco's
new king, Mohammed VI, as a ``man of peace'' Wednesday at the start of a
four-day visit aimed at building confidence between the two countries, media
reports said.
</P>
<P>
	   After a two-hour visit between the two at the royal palace in Rabat, Levy
said the king was ``ready to continue his father's work'' in the Mideast peace
process, the official MAP news agency said. Levy is the first Israeli official
to visit since King Mohammed came to the throne in July.
</P>
<P>
	   Morocco and Israel have low-level diplomatic relations and Levy's trip
suggests that Morocco is not about to forgo its discreet but important role in
the Middle East peace process despite the death of King Hassan II, who broke
Arab world taboos to hold secret talks with Israeli officials.
</P>
<P>
	   MAP quoted Levy as saying Mohammed was ready to play the role of
intermediary in the peace process and had a good knowledge of the problems. He
said the meeting was frank and warm, and praised the ``young wise king whom we
respect and encourage.''
</P>
<P>
	   Levy met other Moroccan officials during the visit, which is meant to pave
the way for a trip to the kingdom by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel's Channel Two TV reported that Mohammed invited Barak to visit
Morocco during Wednesday's meeting. It said Levy also extended an invitation to
the king to visit Israel and Mohammed said he would like to.
</P>
<P>
	   The trip was also an emotional homecoming for 61-year-old Levy, who left
Morocco for Israel at age 20 and has only been back once, briefly, to attend the
funeral of Hassan in July.
</P>
<P>
	   As a young immigrant in Israel, Levy worked his way up from ditch digger and
union activist to political leader. Throughout his political career, first in
the hawkish Likud Party and then in Barak's moderate One Israel alignment, he
presented himself as a champion of Sephardi Jews with Mideastern roots, who have
long complained about discrimination by Israel's European-born elites.

<HEADLINE> Maine House Fire Kills Three Kids  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITY, Maine (AP) -- Seven-year-old triplets boys died when their house
caught fire Wednesday afternoon, authorities said. Their mother escaped with
another child and yelled to firefighters that her sons were still inside, but
firefighters couldn't reach them.
</P>
<P>
	   Firefighters were recovering the bodies of the three brothers from the
gutted home late Wednesday night, Stephen McCausland of the Maine Public Safety
Department said.
</P>
<P>
	   Unity Fire Chief Dennis A. Turner identified the triplets as Josh, Marcus
and Brydon Freyer.
</P>
<P>
	   The mother, Carmen Freyer, 28, was hospitalized in good condition, and the
other child was unharmed.
</P>
<P>
	   John Dean, the state fire marshal, said after the fire was extinguished that
the house ``still has walls and part of the roof, but it's destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said it was too early to tell the cause of the fire.
</P>
<P>
	   Waldo County Sheriff Robert M. Jones, 48, who responded to the call for
firefighters, collapsed near the home and later died at Maine General Medical
Center in Waterville, a hospital spokesman said. The cause of death was not
available, but McCausland said it was believed to be a heart attack.

<HEADLINE> Water Main Breaks in Cleveland  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- A water main broke in downtown Cleveland on Wednesday,
knocking out power and sending water pouring through some of the city's busiest
streets.
</P>
<P>
	   The city's schools were closed Thursday and residents were advised to boil
their water.
</P>
<P>
	   Mayor Michael R. White said the area affected by the break may not be
useable until next week.
</P>
<P>
	   The water main broke about 5:45 p.m. and knocked out power to nearby office
buildings and lowered water pressure through the city and some western suburbs.
</P>
<P>
	   At least three cars were stuck in water a couple of feet deep. Motorists
were able to leave the cars safely.
</P>
<P>
	   The cause of the break in the three-foot-wide pipe was unknown.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I didn't know the lake (Lake Erie) came in this close,'' joked Zale
Kesler, a businessman from Dallas who was unable to reach his hotel. ``I need a
boat.''
