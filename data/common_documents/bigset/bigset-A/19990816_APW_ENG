<HEADLINE> First School Voucher Program Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- Parents and nuns beamed as the nation's  
first statewide school voucher program took effect, but opponents 
derided its debut as a violation of the principle of separation of 
church and state. 
</P>
<P>
	``One child getting a better education makes our world a little  
bit better,'' said Sister Robert Ann, principal of St. Michael 
Interparochial School, where 20 of the state's 58 voucher students 
began classes on Monday. ``And if they have a little bit of 
religion, all the better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The program, launched Monday at four Roman Catholic schools and  
a private school, allows students in Florida's worst public schools 
to receive vouchers of up to $3,389 a year to pay for a private or 
parochial school education at taxpayer expense. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a law championed by Republican Gov. Jeb Bush, only  
children in schools deemed failures by the state are eligible. So 
far, student test scores have labeled only two schools, both in 
Pensacola, as failing. Florida has 2 million public school 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had other children attend the public school system and  
right now, academically, they're having some really hard times,'' 
said Brenda McShane, whose 6-year-old daughter Brenisha has begun 
classes at Montessori Early School. 
</P>
<P>
	But while voucher supporters declared Monday a historic day,  
opponents of what Bush calls ``opportunity scholarships'' contend 
the program violates the constitutional principle of separation of 
church and state. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawsuits challenging the program have been filed by the NAACP,  
Americans United for Separation of Church and State, teachers 
unions and others. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the program, voucher funds are taken from public  
education. Parents who participate do not have to pay the 
difference between the voucher amount and the tuition the private 
schools charge. Private schools that charge more must absorb the 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Only five private schools have agreed to take voucher students.  
Some administrators are afraid of lowering academic standards, and 
others want to see how the program works the first year. 
</P>
<P>
	Smaller voucher programs are in effect in other cities,  
including Milwaukee and Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Voucher students must attend religion classes and Mass with  
their classmates regardless of their religion, said Sister Mary 
Caplice, superintendent of Pensacola's Catholic schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Although she is a Methodist, Mary Smith decided to enroll her  
children, first-grader Antonio Held, 7, and fifth-grader Angela 
Atwood, 10, at St. John the Evangelist Catholic School. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe if they put prayer back in school that they'll see a  
change,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	At St. Michael, boys in dark slacks and girls in plaid skirts  
gathered on Monday morning for the daily flag-raising and prayer to 
the school's patron saint, the voucher students indistinguishable 
from other classmates. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers have not been told which students are on vouchers, said  
St. Michael's principal, Sister Robert Ann. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're more interested in saying, 'Here's my new children,  
what can I do to help them read and write and spell and do 
everything well?''' she said.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Recalls Minivans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG is voluntarily  
recalling 1.4 million 1991-1993 Chrysler Town and Country, Dodge 
Caravan and Plymouth Voyager minivans and 743,000 1996 minivans. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1991-1993 model year minivans are being recalled because of  
a possible problem that could cause the hatchback, or liftgate, to 
fall once it's opened, DaimlerChrysler said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bolts that secure the liftgate strut may loosen and separate  
from the minivan, leaving the liftgate unsupported, the automaker 
said. Eighteen people have reported minor injuries from the 
hatchback falling on them, DaimlerChrysler spokeswoman Sheila 
Gruber McLean said. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall expands an earlier recall of model year 1992  
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	In another recall affecting the same vehicles, the automaker is  
seeking to fix a possible problem with the windshield wipers. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100 motorists have complained they were unable to see  
properly during inclement weather because the windshield wipers 
stopped working, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration, which was investigating the minivans' wiper 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency said in a July report that there were no reports of  
crashes or injuries as a result of the windshield wiper 
malfunctions. 
</P>
<P>
	In the recall affecting 743,000 1996 Chrysler Town and Country,  
Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager minivans, DaimlerChrysler said 
it would replace the lock nut and gasket on the fuel pump. 
</P>
<P>
	There were six reports of small underbody fires, but no  
injuries, caused by leaking lock nuts. The lock nuts act like a 
mason jar in sealing the gas tank, McLean said. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners of the affected vehicles will be notified by mail next  
month and will be advised to call their dealers to schedule service 
appointments. The repairs will be made at no cost to customers.

<HEADLINE> Piazza Homers, Ties Club Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Mike Piazza tied a New York Mets club record  
for the second time this season when he homered in his fourth 
straight game Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza drove a 2-2 pitch from San Diego's Sterling Hitchcock an  
estimated 448 feet into the second deck at Qualcomm Stadium to give 
the Mets a 1-0 lead in the second inning. It was his 27th this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the seventh time a Mets player accomplished the feat.  
Piazza also homered in four straight games from May 17-21. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza's shot was the 24th to reach the second deck in 31  
seasons. He became the first opponent to hit two loge launches. The 
first was Sept. 22, 1996, when he was with the Los Angeles Dodgers.

<HEADLINE> 'Sixth Sense' Haunts Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Disney had a premonition ``The Sixth Sense''  
would do well at the box office. The studio was right: The Bruce 
Willis thriller returned to haunt theaters as the No. 1 film for 
the second straight weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sixth Sense,'' about a psychologist treating a boy who  
communicates with the dead, took in $26.1 million, a scant 2 
percent drop from the gross in its opening weekend, according to 
estimates Sunday. The movie has taken in $70 million in its first 
10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bowfinger,'' the Steve Martin-Eddie Murphy comedy about a  
shyster producer trying to make it in Hollywood, bowed in at No. 2 
with $18.2 million in its first weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other movies had disappointing debuts. ``Brokedown Palace,''  
starring Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale as Americans jailed for 
drug smuggling in Thailand, came in ninth with $4 million. 
``Detroit Rock City,'' a comedy about teens trying to score KISS 
concert tickets, opened with $2 million for a likely 13th-place 
premiere. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Blair Witch Project'' slipped from second to third place  
with $15.3 million, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. The 
horror film shot on a tiny budget has grossed $108 million, most of 
that since it went into wide release three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sixth Sense'' is expected to hit $100 million by next weekend,  
said Chuck Viane, head of distribution for Disney, which released 
the film. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally scheduled for October release, ``Sixth Sense'' was  
moved ahead to the busier summer season ``because we knew we had 
something good on our hands,'' Viane said. ``Obviously, it's paid 
off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Playing in 2,395 theaters, ``Sixth Sense'' maintained an  
impressive average of about $10,900 a screen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sixth Sense'' was the first movie since ``Star Wars: Episode I  
-- The Phantom Menace'' to remain No. 1 at the box office for more 
than one weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Phantom Menace'' topped the box office for its first three  
weeks in May and June. Since then, different movies had debuted in 
first place for nine straight weekends. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been a lot of great marketing this summer,'' said Paul  
Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc., which 
tracks movie ticket sales. ``What opens a picture is great 
marketing. After that, it's word of mouth, which 'Sixth Sense' has 
gotten. People really like the movie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Phantom Menace'' contributed to the string of different  
first-place finishers at the box office. Big movie openings were 
packed into the mid- and late summer as studios shuffled their 
slate to avoid bumping up against the sci-fi epic, Dergarabedian 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses for Friday through Sunday at North American  
theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final figures 
are to be released today. 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``The Sixth Sense,'' $26.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Bowfinger,'' $18.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``The Blair Witch Project,'' $15.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``Runaway Bride,'' $14.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``The Thomas Crown Affair,'' $10.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``Deep Blue Sea,'' $6.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``Inspector Gadget,'' $6.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``Mystery Men,'' $4.9 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``Brokedown Palace,'' $4 million  
</P>

	10. ``Iron Giant,'' $3.8 million.

<HEADLINE> Hawks Waive Swingman Corbin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Hawks, committed to making their  
roster younger, waived swingman Tyrone Corbin and forward Duane 
Ferrell on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Corbin, 36, helped out after injuries decimated the  
lineup. Normally a small forward, he filled in for injured guard 
Steve Smith, and played in 47 games, fourth-highest on the team. He 
averaged 7.5 points and 3.1 rebounds per game in the first year of 
a two-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferrell, 34, arrived earlier this summer with point guard Bimbo  
Coles in a trade that sent Mookie Blaylock to the Golden State 
Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
	A former star at Georgia Tech, Ferrell played in only eight  
games for the Warriors last season because of tendinitis in his 
left knee. He spent his first six NBA seasons with the Hawks, 
averaging a career-high 12.7 points in 1991-92, and also played for 
the Indiana Pacers.

Alcoa, the world's largest aluminum maker, is offering $65 a share

board yesterday. Alcoa said today that while it would prefer to 
negotiate a takeover with Reynolds' management, it will begin an

	ATLANTA (AP) -- Two Georgia Tech football players have been  
suspended because of conduct ``detrimental to the Tech football 
program,'' coach George O'Leary said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Leary would not elaborate on the offenses of the two players,  
but said quarterback Jermaine Crenshaw, a redshirt freshman

Troy Tolbert, a junior cornerback, will miss the first two games, 
against Navy and Florida State. The third game is against Central 
Florida.

<P>
	Crenshaw was competing for the No. 2 quarterback slot behind Joe  
Hamilton, while Tolbert was competing for a starting position. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Giuliani Prefers Entering Race Late </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- New York City Mayor Rudolph  
Giuliani said Monday that Republicans will benefit if he delays 
entering the New York Senate race. 
</P>
<P>
	The longer Hillary Rodham Clinton ``runs against herself, the  
better we do,'' he said. ``The longer the concentration is on her 
and what views she has and doesn't, questions about her connections 
to the state ... that may account for the dramatic drop from being 
19 points ahead to in some polls being 9 or 10 points behind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is exploring a run for the Democratic Senate  
nomination. Early polls in New York had shown her with a wide lead 
over Giuliani but those same polls now show the race even or with 
her trailing the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani made his comments after Republican Rep. Rick Lazio of  
Long Island asked the mayor to quickly announce his intentions. 
Lazio has put his own Senate hopes on hold at the request of Gov. 
George Pataki while Giuliani weighs the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every day that a Republican candidate is not in this race is a  
good day for Hillary Clinton and the Democrats,'' the congressman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor refused to say when he might announce his plans.  
</P>
<P>
	Both Giuliani and Lazio were meeting with top Republican  
officials at the Saratoga race track. 
</P>
<P>
	While Giuliani has the backing of top state GOP leaders,  
including a recent grudging endorsement from Pataki, one of his top 
boosters said Monday that the mayor's candidacy wasn't a sure 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say that they're probably 50-50,'' state Senate  
Majority Leader Joseph Bruno said when asked about the odds on the 
mayor running. 
</P>
<P>
	But he later conceded during an interview with Albany's WROW-AM  
radio that ``if I were going to bet, I would put (money) on the 
nose that he's going to run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If elected, Giuliani would have to leave City Hall a year early  
and ``that's weighing heavily on his mind,'' Bruno said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the current city law of succession, liberal Democrat Mark  
Green, the city's elected public advocate, would fill out the 
mayor's term. Giuliani has appointed a charter revision commission 
to review the succession law. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing earlier Monday on the same radio show, the mayor said  
he was ``certainly getting closer'' to running.

<HEADLINE> Escapes Spur Pa. Prison Lockdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Gov. Tom Ridge on Monday ordered a  
lockdown of all state prisons following the escape of two inmates 
from a facility in eastern Pennsylvania that came two weeks after a 
murderer broke out of another institution. 
</P>
<P>
	Corrections officials would not immediately say how Michael  
McCloskey, 43, and Anthony Yang, 31, escaped the medium-security 
State Correctional Institution at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	McCloskey, who was serving a life sentence for murder, and Yang,  
who was serving a 20- to 50-year sentence for arson, were 
discovered missing about 10:45 a.m. Monday. The two shared a cell. 
</P>
<P>
	The escapes came as authorities continue to search for Norman  
Johnston, a four-time killer who broke out of the maximum-security 
State Correctional Institution at Huntingdon on Aug. 2 after 
cutting his way through a cell window and two security fences. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is unacceptable,'' Ridge said. ``I have ordered the  
immediate lockdown of the entire state prison system, and I have 
directed Secretary (Martin) Horn to begin an immediate check of 
every security system at every one of our 24 institutions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ridge also directed State Police Commissioner Paul Evanko to  
begin round-the-clock patrols on the perimeter of state prisons. 
</P>
<P>
	While authorities focused their search efforts Monday for  
McCloskey and Yang near the prison 100 miles northwest of 
Philadelphia, police have been searching for Johnston in 
southeastern Pennsylvania, Maryland and Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston was convicted in March 1980 of killing four teen-agers  
to cover up a multimillion-dollar burglary ring he ran with his two 
brothers. The film ``At Close Range,'' starring Sean Penn, was 
based on the case.

<HEADLINE> Team To Oversee Texas Funeral Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- The state is dispatching a team to  
temporarily oversee the Texas Funeral Service Commission, an agency 
at the center of a whistleblower lawsuit in which Gov. George W. 
Bush has been subpoenaed. 
</P>
<P>
	The former funeral agency director claims she was fired after  
investigating a company that donated money to Bush, the front 
runner for the Republican presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Comptroller Carole Keeton Rylander told The Associated Press on  
Monday that she's assembling a team at the request of the funeral 
commission's governing board and Bush's office. 
</P>
<P>
	The comptroller employees will work at the funeral agency for 30  
to 90 days with ``complete authority to manage administrative 
affairs at the agency,'' Ms. Rylander said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the agency has a backlog of both consumer complaints  
and applications from funeral service providers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Rylander said her actions aren't related to the firing of  
the former funeral agency director, which resulted in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush isn't a defendant in the lawsuit filed by former commission  
executive director Eliza May. His lawyers are scheduled to be in 
court Aug. 30 to argue that the subpoena should be dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has said he knows nothing about the firing of Ms. May, who  
lost her job in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. May, once treasurer of the Texas Democratic Party, led an  
investigation into embalming practices of Service Corp. 
International, the owner of 3,700 funeral homes. SCI's political 
action committee gave Bush $35,000 in 1996 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	That inquiry resulted in a recommended fine of $445,000. SCI is  
fighting the fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. May's lawsuit says she was dismissed nine months after being  
called into the office of Joe Allbaugh, Bush's executive assistant, 
and asked to explain inspections on April 10, 1998, at two SCI 
affiliates. Allbaugh now manages Bush's presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has denied any wrongdoing. Bush filed an affidavit  
swearing he had no conversations with SCI officials about the state 
probe.

<HEADLINE> Thrashers Get Lambert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Thrashers acquired left wing Denny  
Lambert from the Nashville Predators on Monday in exchange for the 
rights to center Randy Robitaille. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very pleased to add a forward of Denny's caliber to the  
organization,'' said Don Waddell, vice president and general 
manager of the Thrashers. ``He is a hard-nosed player who really 
competes every night and will be exciting for fans to watch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lambert was second on the Predators with 218 penalty minutes  
last year. He scored 16 points and has appeared in 70 or more games 
the last three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-foot-11, 200-pound Lambert signed as a free agent with  
Ottawa in 1996 and played two seasons, scoring 19 points in 
1997-98. 
</P>
<P>
	The Thrashers got Robitaille from the Boston Bruins for Peter  
Ferraro on June 25 during the expansion draft.

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Van Flip Kills 2, Injures 13 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, N.Y. (AP) -- A van carrying 15 people home from a  
family reunion flipped and rolled on the New York State Thruway on 
Monday morning, killing two people and throwing 13 others onto the 
roadway and into a field. 
</P>
<P>
	The group had been traveling all night after attending a reunion  
in Greenville, Miss. Two of the van's eight adults, including the 
driver, died following the crash, which occurred about 50 miles 
west of Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said the driver, Doris Lewis, 43 -- a Buffalo  
police officer -- apparently dozed off, awoke as the van was leaving 
the road and overcorrected the steering, sending the van into a 
sideways roll. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven children, ages 5 to 13, were among those thrown from the  
van as it rolled at least three times and came to rest against a 
tree. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were people scattered all over, and some were real  
serious and some were very young,'' Capt. David O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Five of the children were in critical condition, and the others  
were in serious and good condition.

<HEADLINE> Court Upholds Colonial-Era Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A life prison term for a radical Islamic cleric  
accused of plotting with a band of terrorists to blow up New York 
landmarks and kill Egypt's president is not too harsh, a federal 
appeals court ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	``To plan the waging of war against the United States is  
manifestly a grievous assault on the American people, meriting 
extremely serious punishment,'' the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals said Monday in upholding the sentences for Sheik Omar 
Abdel-Rahman and nine of his followers. 
</P>
<P>
	The sheik and a second defendant were sentenced to life in  
prison while the rest received sentences ranging from 30 years to 
57 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Although not the first ruling to uphold the constitutionality of  
a Civil War-era seditious conspiracy law, Monday's decision 
demonstrated how the law can be used to prosecute terrorists. The 
law makes it illegal to plan to wage war against the government. 
</P>
<P>
	``When one considers the huge scale of death and destruction  
contemplated by the defendants as part of their war against the 
United States, those sentences are neither plainly unreasonable ... 
nor unjust,'' the court said. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdeen Jabara, a lawyer who has worked on the Egyptian cleric's  
case, said Monday it was too early to comment on the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court also rejected a defense argument that the  
sheik was merely prosecuted for preaching or exercising his First 
Amendment rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdel-Rahman was prosecuted because he sought to solicit or  
persuade others to commit violent crimes, the appeals court said. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said the evidence against Abdel-Rahman showed he  
crossed the line beyond expression of unpopular ideas by telling 
one defendant to carry out an assassination and another that it was 
his duty to bomb the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It remains fundamental that while the state may not  
criminalize the expression of views, it may nonetheless outlaw 
encouragement, inducement or conspiracy to take violent action,'' 
the court said. 
</P>
<P>
	The blind, 61-year-old cleric was sentenced in 1995 to life in  
prison without parole. Also sentenced to life was El Sayyid Nosair, 
who was convicted in connection with the 1990 assassination of 
Jewish Defense League founder Rabbi Meir Kahane. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial focused on Kahane's death and on a 1993 plot to  
assassinate Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and blow up the United 
Nations, FBI headquarters and two tunnels and a bridge connecting 
New Jersey to Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	Marvin Smilon, a spokesman for U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White,  
called the appeals court ruling ``an important milestone in the 
continuing efforts by this office and the FBI's Joint Terrorist 
Task Force to apprehend and prosecute those who commit and plot to 
commit terrorist acts to the fullest extent that our laws allow.''

<HEADLINE> Antioxidants May Fight Rare Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Animal research suggests doctors might look to  
antioxidants to help fight a rare but lethal inherited disease that 
puts most child sufferers in wheelchairs by their teens and kills 
them by their 20s. 
</P>
<P>
	The new research is only in mice, not in people, but it  
indicates that a buildup of damage from destructive molecules 
called ``free radicals'' may help fuel the deadly disease called 
ataxia-telangiectasia -- pronounced Ay-TACK-see-uh 
Teh-LAN-jick-TAY-sha -- and better known as A-T. 
</P>
<P>
	The A-T Children's Project, a patient advocacy group that helps  
fund A-T research, considers the finding a strong enough lead that 
it will gather antioxidant experts in November to determine which 
substances should be tested as possible A-T treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we have absolutely no treatment for this brutal disease,''  
said project director Brad Margus, who has two sons with A-T. The 
new research ``gives us impetus to proceed with pursuing the most 
... powerful antioxidants we can try, first on mice and hopefully 
on children with the disease.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A-T's first signs are an unsteady gait, slurred speech and poor  
muscle coordination in young children. Eventually, children lose 
all motor control. A-T also weakens their immune systems. Patients 
usually die in their 20s of cancer or infections. 
</P>
<P>
	About 500 American children have A-T, which worldwide strikes  
about one in every 40,000 children. 
</P>
<P>
	The genetic defect that causes A-T was discovered in 1995, but  
that discovery has not yet led to treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	The new research, from California's Salk Institute for  
Biological Studies, suggests the gene defect leaves A-T patients 
without protection against damage from the free radicals that may 
kill their brain cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Everybody experiences this so-called oxidative damage from free  
radicals, byproducts of metabolism that attack cells. Most people's 
bodies can counter and repair oxidative damage, helped by 
antioxidants like vitamins C and E. But sometimes free radicals go 
out of control, causing or contributing to cancer, Alzheimer's and 
other diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	Salk lead researcher Dr. Carrolee Barlow bred mice with the A-T  
gene defect and examined cells from the cerebellum, the brain 
region that controls movement. A-T patients' progressive loss of 
motor control occurs when vital cerebellum cells die. 
</P>
<P>
	In this week's Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,  
Barlow reports on evidence that suggests the mouse brain cells were 
killed by free radicals. 
</P>
<P>
	Some desperate A-T families already have tried over-the-counter  
antioxidants with no apparent effect, scientists note. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may be that those compounds just aren't strong enough,''  
said Barlow, who is testing in mice an experimental antioxidant 
created by the National Cancer Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Other researchers, Margus said, are creating antioxidants that  
promise to be hundreds of times more powerful than Vitamin C.

<HEADLINE> IAAF: Ben Johnson Can't Come Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Six years after he was banned for life  
after a second positive drug test, Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson 
lost his bid for reinstatement today. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Amateur Athletic Federation, track and field's  
world governing body, rejected a petition to allow the 37-year-old 
athlete to return to competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF's decision-making Council accepted the recommendation  
of a special three-person panel which studied Johnson's case. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF said the ruling is final, with no possibility of an  
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, a Canadian arbitrator ruled that Johnson should be  
allowed to seek reinstatement on grounds that the sprinter did not 
have all his appeals explained to him by the Canadian federation 
when he was banned for life in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri said the special panel reviewed  
all the documents on the case and listened to Johnson at a hearing 
in Monaco on Aug. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Reineri said the panel ruled that the Canadian arbitrator,  
Graeme Mew, had ``no right'' to interfere in a decision of a 
sport's world governing body. 
</P>
<P>
	``In any case, even if the arbitrator had this right, he made a  
mistake because the Canadian federation was correct when they 
decided to ban Johnson for life,'' Reineri said. ``On this basis, 
the IAAF decided not to give reinstatement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was stripped of his Olympic gold medal and 100-meter  
world record after testing positive for steroids at the 1988 Seoul 
Games. After serving a two-year suspension, he received a lifetime 
ban after testing positive for a high testosterone level in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson appeared before the IAAF panel in Monaco last month to  
plead his case. 
</P>
<P>
	Before today's ruling, he had expressed confidence that he would  
be reinstated and said he hoped to run in next year's Sydney 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	There had also been speculation that, if reinstated, Johnson  
might run on the Canadian sprint relay team at the World 
Championships, which open Saturday in Seville. 
</P>
<P>
	The members of the IAAF panel which reviewed his case were IAAF  
general secretary Istvan Gyulai, German federation chief Helmut 
Digel and honorary treasurer Robert Stinson.

<HEADLINE> Browns' Couch To Get First Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- Cleveland Browns coach Chris Palmer doesn't  
want anyone to be fooled by who is the starting quarterback in 
Saturday's exhibition game against the Minnesota Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	That may be rookie Tim Couch taking the first snap in the  
inaugural game at Browns Stadium, but Ty Detmer is still slated as 
Cleveland's starter come opening day, Palmer said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Detmer has been the starter for the Browns (1-1) in both  
exhibition games so far, while Couch, the top overall draft pick, 
has come in during the second and third quarters. Palmer said he 
wants to see what each can do in different situations on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ty would still be the starting quarterback if we opened the  
regular season tomorrow, but we're going to give Tim a chance to 
start Saturday and play with the first group,'' Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer said he's not upset with Detmer and saw some good things  
from the veteran in Saturday's 30-3 loss at Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we've never seen Ty work yet in the two-minute drill and  
we've not seen Tim start a game. So we're going to put Ty in for 
the second quarter in order for him to have a chance to do that,'' 
Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, who said he planned to give Couch a start in the  
preseason, expects Detmer to start the Browns' final exhibition 
game with the Chicago Bears on Aug. 28, and again in the season 
opener Sept. 12 at home against the Pittsburgh Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd rather start Tim this week than in the Chicago game,  
because that's the game where we're trying to settle down, play the 
people we're going to open the season with and get them some 
extensive work,'' Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Detmer, in playing the first quarter of the opening two games,  
is 4-of-13 for 33 yards and no touchdowns. He was 2-of-7 for 22 
yards against the Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch was impressive in the Hall of Fame Game win over Dallas,  
going 11-of-17 for 137 yards, but struggled against Tampa at 
5-of-12 for 27 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was kind of a surprise when I came in this morning and  
Coach Palmer told me,'' Couch said Monday. ``I just smiled. I told 
him, `It sounds good to me.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Couch says his goal is to be the permanent starter, even as a  
rookie. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been working as hard as I can ever since I got drafted to  
get to this point and have the chance to show them what I can do,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Detmer said he was disappointed by Palmer's announcement, but is  
confident the switch won't be permanent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's job here, not just mine, is on the line every day.  
That's just the way this business is'' said the eighth-year pro, 
who has also played for Green Bay, Philadelphia and San Francisco. 
``But the decision on who's going to start wasn't made at the time 
of the draft. It won't be made now. It will be made later on, 
sometime before the Pittsburgh game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns made their first cuts of training camp Monday.  
Released were linebackers Jerry Rudzinski and David Menard; 
receivers Sylvain Girard, Joseph Nastasi and Mark Seay; defensive 
end Rod Manuel; and defensive backs Kory Blackwell and Eric Stokes.

<HEADLINE> Lithuania Debugs Nuclear Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VISAGINAS, Lithuania (AP) -- Like software experts around the  
world, Aleksandr Mysko is scrambling to ensure the computers at his 
workplace are free of the millennium bug. 
</P>
<P>
	He may be under more pressure than most. His task is to  
safeguard Ignalina nuclear power plant, the Soviet-built, 
Chernobyl-style reactor that provides 80 percent of Lithuania's 
electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	But he's optimistic. ``Ironically, vis-a-vis Y2K anyway, we're  
very lucky this plant is Soviet made,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason: Ignalina is less sophisticated than Western-built  
power plants, and thus potentially less vulnerable to the year 2000 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	When 1999 comes to an end, computers that use the last two  
digits of a year to keep track of dates could mistake 2000 for 
1900, possibly causing vital systems to crash. 
</P>
<P>
	A shutdown at Ignalina would certainly damage Lithuania's  
economy, but the greater worry is whether a problem with a critical 
computer might lead to a nuclear accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Outwardly, Ignalina hardly inspires confidence. Concrete  
crumbles off the plant's 15-year-old facade, which is ringed by 
pot-holed roads and strewn with derelict, rusty cranes. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Mysko, who heads a 30-man Y2K debugging project,  
says he's confident the plant will perform safely. 
</P>
<P>
	He has some support for that hopeful assessment.  
</P>
<P>
	The International Atomic Energy Agency said Soviet-built plants  
like Ignalina aren't as reliant on computers prone to Y2K foul-ups. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're built more like work horses than thoroughbreds,'' said  
David Kyd, a spokesman at the U.N. agency's headquarters in Vienna, 
Austria. ``Their computer systems are more rugged and less 
sensitive than those in the West.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Surveys of Lithuania's overall Y2K preparedness aren't so  
optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S.-based Gartner Group concluded in a recent report that  
Lithuania was no better prepared than Afghanistan and Vietnam, 
which are hardly prepared at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrea Di Maio, a Gartner nuclear power specialist, said he  
couldn't speak specifically about Ignalina, but agreed that safety 
systems at atomic plants, including Soviet-made ones, generally 
don't depend on time-sensitive computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall efficiency (of nuclear plants) could be affected by  
Y2K problems. Their electrical distribution systems could be 
disrupted, for instance,'' he said. ``But I wouldn't think people 
should be worried about mega accidents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report didn't include the two other Baltic states, though  
regional analysts say Estonia and Latvia seem to be faring better 
than Lithuania in fixing their computer systems. And they don't 
have nuclear power plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Lithuanians don't seem overly worried.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's going to blow up,'' said Igor Molianoki, an  
engineer in the capital of Vilnius, 80 miles south of Ignalina. 
``The Soviets knew how to build these things right. This plant 
won't pose a threat, neither on 2000 nor on 2050.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The world's worst nuclear accident happened in 1986 in Ukraine  
when one of the Chernobyl plant's four reactors blew up, sending a 
radioactive chemical cloud over Russia and much of Europe. The 
plant continues to report chronic malfunctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Lithuanians don't seem even aware of the potential problem.  
</P>
<P>
	Thumbing through a stack of Y2K-related directives, Mysko said  
he couldn't say if Lithuania as a whole deserved poor marks on 
preparedness, but insisted Ignalina does not. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant ran its first Y2K tests early last year, following  
detailed procedures developed by the U.S. Department of Energy, he 
said. He said all of the station's approximately 1,000 computers 
and all software had been checked and found to be free of 
year-change problems. 
</P>
<P>
	That review also confirmed the safety systems that shut reactors  
down at early signs of a malfunction are operated either manually 
or by automatic control, and thus are not reliant on date-sensitive 
computers or software, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mysko insisted he is ``100 percent sure we won't have Y2K  
problems here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All the same, he won't be partying to celebrate the end of one  
millennium and the start of another. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm bringing my bed to the plant that night. Are you  
kidding?'' he said. ``I wouldn't be anywhere but right here on New 
Year's Eve, making sure everything's all right.''

<HEADLINE> Red Sox Activate Scott Hatteberg </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Boston Red Sox on Monday activated catcher  
Scott Hatteberg from the 15-day disabled list and signed 
first-round draft pick Rick Asadoorian to a minor league contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatteberg went on the disabled list on May 17 to recover from  
surgery on his right elbow. He was on a 20-day rehabilitation 
assignment that ended Friday and when the Red Sox delayed restoring 
him to the roster, Hatteberg contemplated filing a grievance. 
</P>
<P>
	But the team designated catcher Lenny Webster for assignment on  
Monday, making room for Hatteberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Asadoorian, a 19-year-old outfielder from Whitinsville, hit .500  
with seven homer and 41 RBIs in his senior year at Northbridge High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
	Asadoorian was the 17th overall selection in the draft. His  
signing bonus is worth $1,825,000, including payments for college 
education, according to The Boston Globe.

<HEADLINE> Zolak To Get Shot as Jets' No. 2 QB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- The New York Jets have a quarterback  
controversy, after all. 
</P>
<P>
	Though starter Vinny Testaverde solidified his position with a  
superb exhibition debut Saturday night at Green Bay, the battle for 
the backup slot intensified when Ray Lucas had a poor second half 
against the Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're looking for consistency, as best as you can get it,''  
coach Bill Parcells said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	That search continues Friday when Scott Zolak, considered the  
front-runner for the No. 2 slot, receives most of the snaps in the 
Jets' home exhibition opener against the Philadelphia Eagles. 
Lucas, a former special teams ace converted to full-time 
quarterback last season, likely won't see any action against 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could have put Zolak in the other night, and that might have  
changed the game, but I kind of made a commitment to take an 
extended look at Ray and give him a chance,'' Parcells said. ``Now, 
I'm going to do the same thing with Scott.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zolak, 32, said he welcomes the opportunity.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in this position before,'' said Zolak, who played  
for Parcells at New England from 1993-96 when he served as a backup 
to Drew Bledsoe. ``You just go with what the guy says and let the 
chips fall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Saturday's 27-16 loss to the Packers, Lucas was 14-of-32 for  
143 yards in almost three quarters after following Testaverde, who 
was 11-of-13 for 147 yards and a TD. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucas, who was sacked four times, drove the team to two field  
goals in nine possessions. He led the Jets with 42 yards on five 
rushes, usually after being chased from the pocket. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't do what I needed to do,'' Lucas said. ``You never  
know when you're going to get another chance. Zolak's going to play 
all next (game), and Vinny's got to play the third and fourth weeks 
to get ready for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't think I went out there and showed Parcells that I  
could drop back there and throw the ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That task now falls to Zolak, a ninth-year veteran who doesn't  
have the speed and agility of Lucas, but has a strong arm and a 
deep knowledge of Parcells' game plan. The former fourth-round 
draft pick by the Patriots, signed by the Jets to a one-year, 
$400,000 deal during the offseason, has been a career backup, with 
seven starts in 53 games. A season ago, he was 1-2 as a starter in 
place of the injured Bledsoe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I'm with a new team, said Zolak, who has thrown for 1,314  
yards and eight touchdowns during his career, completing 50.8 
percent of his passes. ``It's just tough getting in with a new 
team. It's like you're starting all over again, like you're a 
rookie, even though it's my ninth year. Everybody has to get 
comfortable with you, that's the big thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the offseason, Parcells also gave a four-year, $6.1  
million contract to former Patriots punter Tom Tupa, who can also 
play quarterback. Parcells, however, insists Tupa will only be 
asked to kick, and is not part of the scramble for a backup role. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what's going to happen,'' Parcells said. ``As I  
told you before, I don't know who the No. 2 quarterback is. I don't 
know if I have one.''

<HEADLINE> Gunman Says Sorry, He Had Wrong Guy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAGERSTOWN, Md. (AP) -- Volunteer firefighter Andrew Ebner was  
heading home from battling a late-night blaze when a shotgun blast 
hit the tailgate of his borrowed pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
	Ebner sped up but so did the truck on his tail. Boom! Boom! Two  
more blasts. Glass showered the cab from the shattered rear window. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, Ebner stopped the truck along the country road.  
</P>
<P>
	``I figured if I stayed in the truck, he was going to keep on  
shooting,'' Ebner said. ``I got out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's when the shooter realized he had the wrong guy. Kenneth  
Ramsburg apologized, offered to pay for the damage and gave Ebner 
his business card. Then, police say, he drove 10 miles to a liquor 
store parking lot, where he found his intended victim and shot him 
in the leg. 
</P>
<P>
	On his way back home, Ramsburg passed Ebner and two sheriff's  
deputies who were taking his statement. The deputies pursued and 
arrested Ramsburg, who was being held without bail Monday on 
charges including attempted murder and driving while intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I honestly believe that when the guy woke up this morning, he  
probably realized he did something he wished he never did,'' said 
Ebner, who wasn't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramsburg, 38, a construction machine operator, told police he  
shot at Ebner's gray 1997 Ford pickup three times after mistaking 
it for a red 1986 Ford truck that had been on his property earlier 
Saturday night. He said someone in that pickup had shot at his 
house. 
</P>
<P>
	John C. Smith, the victim in the liquor store shooting, denied  
firing at Ramsburg's house. He said he and two friends had 
encountered a drunken and disagreeable Ramsburg earlier that night 
at a bar, then left in his red Ford pickup and drove to the liquor 
store, where they talked in the parking lot until Ramsburg showed 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to talk to him,'' Smith said. ``But you can't control  
someone when they're drinking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said Ramsburg shot at his truck and then shot him in the  
right calf. He was in fair condition Monday.

<HEADLINE> Russia Parliament OKs Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's parliament approved Vladimir Putin as the  
country's new prime minister today, yielding to Boris Yeltsin 
rather than risk a showdown with the unpredictable president. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite its frustration with Yeltsin's revolving-door  
governments, parliament's lower house, the State Duma, voted 233-84 
to approve Putin, a former KGB agent who was the head of the 
country's main security agency. Putin needed a simple majority -- 
226 votes -- to be confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Putin said he would keep the Cabinet of ousted Prime Minister  
Sergei Stepashin largely unchanged and promised to strengthen 
social policies to help the poor. Previous premiers have pursued 
the same aims, with little success. 
</P>
<P>
	``To a large degree, the Cabinet's economic policy will be a  
continuation of the course of our predecessors,'' Putin said. ``We 
will continue reforms started by previous Cabinets, but the reforms 
aren't a goal by themselves, they must improve peoples' 
condition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Putin also tried to cater to Communists and other hard-liners by  
promising to help war veterans, write off huge debts run up by 
Russia's ailing defense plants and defend the interests of ethnic 
Russians living in other former Soviet republics. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that Russia must act to protect its global role:  
``Russia must not be shy of its interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin has fired the government four times in the past 17  
months, and while parliament has had bitter fights over his 
candidates for the prime minister's post, lawmakers have ultimately 
approved them all. 
</P>
<P>
	During the debate, most Duma leaders assailed Yeltsin for firing  
Stepashin but did not criticize Putin. 
</P>
<P>
	``Putin's appointment isn't his fault, the real problem is the  
country's Constitution,'' which allows the president to shuffle the 
government so easily, said Nikolai Kharitonov, the leader of the 
hard-line Agrarian faction. 
</P>
<P>
	If legislators had rejected Putin, it could have triggered a  
full-scale confrontation with Yeltsin. The Russian Constitution 
says Yeltsin must dissolve parliament if it rejects his candidate 
three times. But with parliamentary elections set for December, 
lawmakers were in no mood for a showdown that could cost them their 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Communists, who make up the largest faction in the Duma, met  
with Putin before the ballot today and said each party member would 
make his or her own decision on his candidacy, clearing the way for 
a quick approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Many politicians and the media have speculated that the Kremlin  
was considering introducing a state of emergency to put off 
parliamentary elections in December and the presidential vote set 
for next summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin denied that today.  
</P>
<P>
	``Once again I firmly and resolutely state as the president of  
the country: There will be no state of emergency,'' he told 
reporters in the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
	Putin, 42, promised that the elections would be held as  
scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	``The essential goal is to ensure law and order and hold honest  
and fair parliamentary and presidential elections,'' he told 
lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Putin will face a host of challenges as premier. The country's  
economy continues to struggle, Yeltsin's erratic behavior has left 
the government unstable, and Russian forces are battling Islamic 
rebels in the southern republic of Dagestan. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin gave no reason for firing Stepashin, but the president  
apparently wanted a tougher prime minister to keep his political 
foes at bay as he struggles through his final year in office.

<HEADLINE> Graham Makes Sure of No QB Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Even before Kerry Collins took his first  
snap with the New York Giants, Kent Graham ended any possibility of 
a quarterback controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham solidified his job as the No. 1 quarterback on Friday  
night by going 5-of-6 for 145 yards and two touchdowns in New 
York's 36-21 win over the Minnesota Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kent is not going to give it up easily. He is a competitor, so  
everybody better get used to seeing him play well,'' Giants 
defensive end Michael Strahan said Sunday. ``He is just not going 
to go out there and lay over like everyone expects him to do. I 
feel he is so underrated. At this point, he is playing for a 
measure of respect and he is doing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Giants coach Jim Fassel never wavered in his commitment to  
Graham as his starter, much was made of the Giants' decision to 
sign Collins in the offseason to an almost $17 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The bottom line was a team doesn't pay someone about $5 million  
in his first season to sit on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't seem to make any difference that the troubled Collins  
was coming into this year after a couple of bad seasons and that 
Graham led the Giants to five wins in their last six games last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	At some point, many expected the strong-armed Collins to make a  
run at the starting job. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins looked OK going 8-of-17 for 127 yards and a TD against  
the Vikings. But that paled in comparison to Graham's 15 plays and 
three series to open the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins had to sit out Sunday's practice because of a bruised  
right thigh suffered against the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will probably take a couple of days,'' Collins said.  
``Luckily, it wasn't serious. But it's always tough to watch 
practice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graham connected with rookie Sean Bennett on a 53-yard screen  
pass for a touchdown on a three-play, 77-yard drive on New York's 
first possession Friday. He found Joe Jurevicius on a 37-yard 
scoring pass to cap a five-play, 67-yard second drive. 
</P>
<P>
	Brad Daluiso kicked a 48-yard field goal on Graham's last drive.  
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I played well and did what I had to do out there,''  
Graham said. ``When I looked at the film, it was pretty much what I 
saw out there on the field. We made big plays and that was really 
good to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graham tried to downplay the quarterback situation, even though  
he gets asked about it often. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people are saying there is a controversy, and I don't  
think there is, to be honest,'' Graham said. ``I haven't felt that 
pressure. I know I have to go out and play well, but I haven't felt 
it from the coaching staff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graham said the reason people think there is going to be a  
quarterback controversy is the money. He makes about $1.1 million, 
a lot less than what Collins is getting this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Money is in the back of everyone's mind and it's in the back  
of mine, too,'' Graham said. ``I understand that. But I haven't 
gotten that feeling around here from the coaches or organization as 
a whole.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the rest of the preseason, Graham hopes to see the Giants'  
offense continue to get yards in big chunks, something it hasn't 
done in years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have that potential in this offense,'' said Graham,  
a journeyman drafted in the eighth round by the New York in 1992 
and eventually played in Detroit and Arizona before coming back 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been in this offense long enough to know we have that  
potential especially with our receivers now being so big and strong 
and fast.''

<HEADLINE> Perjury Charges Eyed in Simpson Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Nicole Brown Simpson's sister and her lawyer  
said Monday they are asking the state attorney general to 
investigate the possibility of filing perjury charges against O.J. 
Simpson before a statute of limitations runs out in three months. 
</P>
<P>
	Denise Brown and attorney Gloria Allred said Los Angeles County  
District Attorney Gil Garcetti has taken no action on similar 
requests made to him. 
</P>
<P>
	Allred and Brown said that Simpson lied during his civil trial  
when he testified that he never hit, struck slapped or kicked his 
late wife. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney's spokeswoman Victoria Pipkin would say only  
that ``the matter is still under investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the civil trial, Simpson was held liable for the 1994 deaths  
of Ms. Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman and was ordered to pay 
$33.5 million in damages. In an earlier criminal trial he was 
acquitted of murder.

<HEADLINE> Filmmaker Ready for New Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The huge success of ``The Blair Witch  
Project'' has opened doors for the film's young creators. Now 
they're waiting for the attention to die down so they can 
concentrate on new projects. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fame part kind of gets in the way of the filmmaking part,  
so hopefully the fame will fade and we can get back to 
filmmaking,'' producer Michael Menello said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The film, which was made for about $35,000, has become one of  
the largest grossing independent films in history, bringing in 
around $108 million since it went into wide release three weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The success has elevated the five former University of Central  
Florida film students from starving artists to press-hounded 
celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
	The mock documentary has given directors Daniel Myrick and  
Eduardo Sanchez and producers Gregg Hale, Robin Cowie and Monello 
the financial freedom to focus on the creative side of filmmaking 
instead of spending nearly half their time fundraising. 
</P>
<P>
	But fame has also created new demands on their time, including  
juggling interviews and phone calls from agents, fans and 
``long-lost friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``All we've been doing is struggling to keep up with things,''  
said Sanchez. ``It's amazing how much non-filmmaking there is.''

<HEADLINE> Alcoa Goes to Reynolds Shareholders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Alcoa Inc., the world's largest aluminum  
maker, said today it is taking its offer to buy Reynolds Metals Co. 
directly to Reynolds shareholders after the No. 3 aluminum 
company's board rejected the multibillion-dollar bid as inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
	In turning down Alcoa's offer at a Sunday meeting, the Reynolds  
board opened the door to other offers in what an aluminum industry 
expert says marks the final days of Richmond-based Reynolds as a 
solo company. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm confident that at least one or two other players will come  
into the game at this stage,'' said Ilker Baybars, senior deputy 
dean of the Carnegie Mellon Graduate Business School. ``Reynolds is 
going to be with somebody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Traders already have bid the price of Reynolds above Alcoa's  
hostile offer in expectation of a bigger bid. In afternoon trading, 
Reynolds was down 43 3/4 cents at $68.93 3/4 a share on the New York 
Stock Exchange, where Alcoa was down 12 1/2 cents at $66.37 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to saying it would pursue a cash offer for all of  
Reynolds' shares this week, Alcoa said it would ask Reynolds' 
shareholders to replace the Reynolds board with one that would 
support the Alcoa bid. A spokeswoman for Reynolds did not 
immediately return a telephone call seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Pittsburgh-based Alcoa disclosed its unsolicited  
$65 a share cash-and-stock offer. Alcoa valued its deal at $5.6 
billion, though it did not provide additional details. At $65 a 
share, the deal would be worth only $4.2 billion based on the 
number of Reynolds shares outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
	By week's end, a Chicago-based investment firm, Michigan Avenue  
Partners, said it made a superior all-cash offer for Reynolds but 
declined to disclose details of its bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds' board held a special weekend meeting to discuss the  
Alcoa offer. Afterward, the company issued a statement calling the 
Alcoa bid ``inadequate'' and saying the board decided unanimously 
that Reynolds ``should explore all alternatives to maximize 
shareholder value, including the sale of the company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether the alternatives would include soliciting rival bids to  
Alcoa's offer was unclear. Lou Anne Nabham, a spokeswoman for 
Reynolds, declined to elaborate on the company's statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcoa President Alain J.P. Belda was not available Sunday. A  
call to his home was not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Several analysts have said Alcoa's offer was too low and  
predicted a bidding war. 
</P>
<P>
	``Numerous people who follow the industry made remarks last week  
that the Alcoa bid was too low,'' Baybars said. ``There's a little 
gaming going on here. I think Alcoa is prepared to offer a little 
more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds could get anywhere from $4 to $18 a share more than the  
$65-a-share Alcoa offered, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other possible contenders: Alcan Aluminium Ltd. of  
Canada. Last week, after Alcoa's offer was made public, Alcan 
president and chief executive officer Jacques Bougie said his 
company wouldn't rule out making a bid for Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We exclude no options,'' Bougie said, despite the announcement  
of Alcan's plans for a three-way merger with Alusuisse-Lonza 
Holding (Algroup) of Switzerland and Pechiney S.A. of France. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian and European companies have combined revenues of  
$21.6 billion, which would just eclipse the $21 billion in combined 
revenues of an Alcoa and Reynolds merger.

	Haley Hendrix, 9, was swimming in Keowee Lake about 35 miles  
southeast of Greenville on Saturday when she grabbed hold of a boat 
dock. She became unconscious and went into cardiac arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	After calls for help, Alan Dexter Wheeler swam toward the dock  
and knocked Haley free. The girl was resuscitated by Wheeler's 
nephew and treated and released from a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wheeler, 73, died of a heart attack caused by the same  
current running through the dock, Deputy Coroner Mike Crowe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators were unsure what caused the electrical charge,  
Crowe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheeler was a 30-year veteran of the U.S. Air Force and a  
professor emeritus at Clemson University, where he taught logistics 
and transportation. A professor emeritus is a professor who is 
retired from active service but retains his title.

<HEADLINE>  Daewoo To Sell More Subsidiaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korea's ailing Daewoo group  
bowed to pressure from creditor banks on Monday and agreed to sell 
or spin off all but six of its 25 subsidiaries under a tightened 
restructuring program. 
</P>
<P>
	The new program, approved by Daewoo's six domestic creditor  
banks, will allow the troubled conglomerate to retain its 
automobile unit and five other affiliates -- three fewer than 
previously proposed -- after the restructuring is finished by the 
end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo officials said the restructuring does not affect their  
overseas plants in France, Poland and other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The move came a day after President Kim Dae-jung called for  
stronger reforms at Daewoo and four other top chaebol, or 
conglomerates -- Hyundai, Samsung, LG and SK -- which he said have 
been slow in restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim said a full recovery of South Korea's economy will be  
impossible without reforming or restructuring the debt-ridden 
conglomerates. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he ``will become the first president in South Korean  
history to reform chaebol and straighten the economy so that it 
will grow on the basis of the middle class.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In its initial proposal on July 30, Daewoo had offered to sell  
or spin off all but nine subsidiaries. Domestic creditors had 
rejected the plan as insufficient and asked Daewoo to pare down 
more. 
</P>
<P>
	In its latest plan, Daewoo agreed to sell three more profitable  
affiliates engaged in brokerage, shipbuilding and construction. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision will leave Daewoo with six units: automobile, car  
sales, machinery, telecommunications, trade and finance. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Daewoo's main creditor banks, Korea First Bank, said the  
new restructuring plan should bring Daewoo's debt-to-equity ratio 
to below 200 by the end of the year, as ordered by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo, South Korea's second largest conglomerate, narrowly  
escaped becoming the nation's largest bankruptcy in July when 
domestic creditors agreed to delay repayment of $5.8 billion in 
short-term debt for six months and extend $3.3 billion in new 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, Daewoo promised to cut its debt drastically by  
selling or spinning off most of its 40 subsidiaries and attracting 
foreign investment. But doubt persists that Daewoo can or is 
willing to fulfill its promise. 
</P>
<P>
	About half a dozen South Korean conglomerates collapsed under  
huge bank debts in 1996-97, forcing the country to call in the 
International Monetary Fund to bail out its sinking economy. A 
restructuring of chaebol was a key condition of the $58 billion IMF 
bailout, the world's largest.

<HEADLINE>  Armstrong Competes on Mountain Bike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- For his first bicycle race in the United  
States since winning the Tour de France, Lance Armstrong is giving 
up his skinny road racing tires for the fat nobbies of a mountain 
bike. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, who overcame cancer to win the world's most famous  
cycling race, plans to compete this weekend in the national 
championships of mountain bicycling at the Mount Snow resort in 
West Dover. 
</P>
<P>
	He's entered in the cross-country race, an event that covers  
close to 30 miles in the woods surrounding the resort's ski slopes. 
Armstrong is not expected to dominate the event. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to face some pretty serious competition here,''  
said Rich Wanninger, chief spokesman for USA Cycling, which 
sanctions the competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The weekend races are the finals of the Chevy Trucks National  
Championship series, a six-event competition in which riders 
accumulate points toward the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're a pro rider, that's the way you become a national  
champion,'' said Patrice Quintero, communications coordinator at 
USA Cycling. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong will not be in line for the national championship on  
Friday because he has not been accumulating points throughout the 
series. Instead, he's riding because he enjoys occasional off-road 
racing, Wanninger said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looked at his schedule earlier in the year and he had  
wanted to fit the World Cup (of mountain biking) in Europe, but 
training for the Tour was going so well and he didn't want to 
interrupt it,'' Wanninger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong has ridden in a few single-day events in Europe since  
his victory in Paris in July, but has spent much of his time in the 
United States being welcomed as a returning hero at the White House 
and in his hometown of Austin, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong's strong Tour de France win has been an inspiration to  
millions. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old rider learned in 1996 that he had testicular  
cancer, which spread to his bones and brain. He underwent 
aggressive chemotherapy and three operations. With his cancer in 
remission, Armstrong returned to competitive bicycling. 
</P>
<P>
	Mountain biking, however, is not his forte. He entered a similar  
event in Park City, Utah, last year and dropped out before he could 
finish. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think his motivation this time is to finish,'' Quintero  
said. ``In Utah last year, he said it was the hardest race he ever 
did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mount Snow, a resort in the southern Green Mountains, has become  
a mecca for mountain bicycling enthusiasts and has staged an event 
in the national championship series for the past eight years. This 
year it is drawing the top competitors in the country for the 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The tightest race for a national title will be among the women  
in the cross-country event. Alison Dunlap of Colorado Springs, 
Colo., has a 14-point lead over Ruthie Matthes of Durango, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Since there's a difference of 14 points between the winner and  
second-place finisher at Mount Snow, Friday's race will determine 
which woman becomes national champ. 
</P>
<P>
	The other events over the weekend are downhill, dual slalom,  
observed trials and short-track cross country.

<HEADLINE> Alcoa Goes to Reynolds Shareholders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Spurned by the board of Reynolds Metals  
Co., Alcoa Inc. is taking a hostile $4.2 billion takeover bid 
directly to Reynolds' shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcoa, the world's largest aluminum maker, is offering $65 a  
share in cash for No. 3 Reynolds -- a takeover aimed at maintaining 
Alcoa's dominance in a market battered by low prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds board rejected Alcoa's bid as inadequate. Alcoa said  
Monday that while it would prefer to negotiate a takeover with 
Reynolds' management, it will begin an all-cash offer to Reynolds' 
shareholders this week. It also said it will solicit shareholder 
support for replacing Reynolds' board and dismantling Reynolds' 
takeover defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reynolds board on Sunday unanimously rejected a  
cash-and-stock offer valued at $65 a share. On Monday, after Alcoa 
announced its hostile bid, Reynolds advised shareholders to sit 
tight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Alcoa's actions are designed to serve Alcoa's own interest and  
not the interests of Reynolds Metals' shareholders. Shareholders 
need take no action at this time,'' Reynolds said in a terse 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Alcoa bid, and a separate 3-way merger announced last week,  
are an effort by the companies to increase their competitiveness, 
partly in response to historically low aluminium prices. Early in 
the decade, the collapse of the Soviet Union caused a rise in 
aluminum exports by producers seeking new markets to replace the 
Soviet military. In recent years, the economic slowdowns in Asia, 
Russia and Latin America have cut demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts estimated Reynolds stock to be worth much more than the  
Alcoa bid -- roughly $70 to $80 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcoa ``offered the low-ball bid in hopes getting Reynolds as  
cheap as possible,'' said Lloyd O'Carroll, an analyst for the 
Richmond-based investment firm Scott &AMP; Stringfellow Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``My guess is that the low offer is part of their overall  
strategy, knowing the board would reject it. By going directly to 
the shareholders, perhaps they are hoping to throw a little fear 
into the board before talking sweet to them,'' said O'Carroll, a 
former chief economist for Richmond-based Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders began betting on a better offer last week, bidding up  
the price of Reynolds above Alcoa's offer. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Reynolds fell 43 3/4 cents to close at $68.93 3/4 a share  
on the New York Stock Exchange. That's $3.93 3/4, or 6.1 percent, more 
than Alcoa's bid and represents expectations that a takeover will 
cost at least an additional $254 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcoa rose 37 1/2 cents to $66.87 1/4 on the NYSE.  
</P>
<P>
	Last Wednesday, in announcing the unsolicited bid for Reynolds,  
Pittsburgh-based Alcoa valued its deal at $5.6 billion, though it 
did not provide additional details. At $65 a share, the deal would 
be worth $4.2 billion based on the number of Reynolds shares 
outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcoa's offer was followed Friday by disclosure of an all-cash  
bid from Michigan Avenue Partners, a Chicago real estate investment 
group that entered the metals industry last year with the purchase 
of a Reynolds plant in McCook, Ill. In the past 18 months, the 
investment group has purchased about $1 billion in aluminum assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Reynolds nor Michigan Avenue Partners disclosed any  
details of that offer, though Michigan Avenue Partners called its 
offer superior to Alcoa's. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michigan Avenue is a major real estate developer in the  
Chicago area. They are players,'' O'Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Carroll said Michigan Avenue bought the McCook plant for its  
real estate then found that by cutting costs it could turn a 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their CEO, Mike Lynch, has said he intends to buy a lot of  
aluminum and metal assets, and use cost cutting to make them 
profitable,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Messages left at Michigan Avenue's office were not immediately  
returned Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In rejecting the bid from Alcoa, the Reynolds board said it  
would explore ``all alternatives to maximize shareholder value, 
including the sale of the company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another potential suitor is Alcan Aluminium Ltd. of Canada, the  
world's No. 2 aluminum producer, which already in the midst of a 
merger with French and Swiss competitors that would create a 
company that would top Alcoa in size. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcan's president and chief executive officer, Jacques Bougie,  
said last week his company wouldn't rule out making a bid for 
Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
	If Alcan completes its proposed merger with Alusuisse-Lonza  
Holding (Algroup) of Switzerland and Pechiney S.A. of France it 
would have combined revenue of $21.6 billion, which would just 
eclipse the $21 billion in combined revenue of an Alcoa and 
Reynolds merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcan stock was down 43 3/4 cents at $34.62 1/2 a share on the NYSE.

<HEADLINE> IAAF Rejects British Call on Walker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- World track's governing body referred  
British sprinter Doug Walker's doping case to arbitration today, 
rejecting the British federation's decision to clear him of any 
doping offense. 
</P>
<P>
	IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri said the world body's  
decision-making Council accepted the recommendation of its doping 
commission to send the case to an arbitration panel. 
</P>
<P>
	``The council ruled this is a doping case and the British  
federation had reached an erroneous conclusion in clearing him,'' 
Reineri said. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker remains able to compete pending a ruling by the  
arbitration panel. No date was set for the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, the European 200-meter champion, was banned in March  
after testing positive for the steroid nandrolone in December. 
</P>
<P>
	But a disciplinary committee of UK Athletic cleared him last  
month on grounds that the 26-year-old Scottish sprinter ingested 
the banned substance in an ``innocent and accidental'' manner.

<HEADLINE> Charges May Be Dropped in Diana Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- France's state prosecutor has recommended  
dismissing charges against nine photographers and a press 
motorcyclist placed under formal investigation in the car crash 
that killed Princess Diana, judicial officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of  
anonymity, said the prosecutor decided there was insufficient 
evidence to pursue the charges of manslaughter and failing to aid 
people in danger. 
</P>
<P>
	Diana, her companion Dodi Fayed, and their driver, Henri Paul,  
died when their car crashed in a traffic tunnel in Paris on Aug. 
31, 1997. Only bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones survived. 
</P>
<P>
	French Judge Herve Stephan, who is investigating the accident,  
handed the case over to the state prosecutor earlier this summer 
for a recommendation on whether to bring charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephan, who is not obliged to follow the prosecutor's  
recommendation, is expected to announce soon that the two-year 
investigation into the crash is over. He will then determine 
whether to proceed with charges against the ten suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation initially had focused on the photographers,  
all of whom had been tailing the car in hopes of getting pictures 
of Diana and her boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	Test results showed that Paul was drunk at the time of the  
accident. Alcohol is considered to be the main cause of the crash, 
along with the speed at which Paul was driving.

<HEADLINE> VNU Buys Nielsen for $2.7 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Nielsen Media Research Inc., the  
company synonymous with TV ratings in the United States, is being 
acquired by Dutch publisher VNU for $2.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The planned purchase announced Monday will enable VNU to shift  
the focus of its operations away from traditional print media into 
electronic media and market information. 
</P>
<P>
	Most significantly, New York-based Nielsen will give VNU entry  
into its fast-growing Internet ratings business, Net Ratings, which 
provides information about Internet advertising and customer 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dutch company will offer shareholders $35.60 per share, or a  
total of $2.5 billion, for all of Nielsen's outstanding stock. The 
bid is a premium of 15 percent over its Friday closing share price. 
VNU will also assume $200 million of Nielsen's debt. 
</P>
<P>
	VNU said the addition of Nielsen will significantly increase its  
earnings over a period of five years. However, it said the deal 
would likely have a negative effect on earnings in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts were positive about the agreement, but said the bid was  
slightly on the high side. 
</P>
<P>
	Ab Barneveld, an analyst at MeesPierson in Amsterdam, called the  
buy a ``strategically brilliant step,'' and said it will help VNU 
become less cyclical, as businesses need marketing information 
regardless of the broader economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen's Net Ratings, which executives say may go public next  
year, is believed to have a great deal of growth potential. 
</P>
<P>
	The TV ratings operation has made Nielsen a household name in  
the United States, but the major American networks have been 
dissatisfied for several years, complaining about alleged errors in 
Nielsen ratings. In 1998, the networks contributed $12 million to 
help fund a rival system created by Statistical Research Inc., but 
that system was shut down earlier this year, leaving Nielsen with 
its monopoly in the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen is developing new systems to measure audiences as TV  
technology evolves, including ways for assessing ratings when 
networks are able to send several signals on the same channel. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, VNU had a net profit of $520 million on sales of $2.6  
billion. Nielsen, which has 3,300 employees, had net income of $49 
million and sales of $402 million. 
</P>
<P>
	VNU, with 13,300 employees, provides consumer and professional  
information through publishing and printing operations in the 
Netherlands, Europe and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	VNU shares rose immediately after the opening of trade on the  
Amsterdam Stock Exchange, jumping over 4 percent, but closed 3.5 
percent higher at $38.90 a share. Nielsen rocketed over 13 percent 
shortly after the start of trade in New York, and traded at $37.19 
a share, up $4.38, or 13 percent, in afternoon trading on the New 
York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Picking Ryder Team No Easy Task  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) -- The players had their say, and more. Then  
it was Ben Crenshaw's turn. 
</P>
<P>
	After a PGA Championship that saw almost every player voice an  
opinion on Ryder Cup pay but none play their way onto the team, 
Crenshaw was to announce today his two captain's picks for next 
month's matches in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Lehman was one leading contender, and Fred Couples another.  
But even Crenshaw may have had to toss and turn thinking about this 
one. 
</P>
<P>
	``One choice may be fairly obvious to me and the other will keep  
me up at night,'' Crenshaw said last week. 
</P>
<P>
	If Crenshaw was paying attention in the locker room before  
missing the cut Friday at the PGA Championship, he may have noticed 
a simple plea. 
</P>
<P>
	It was written in black marker on Crenshaw's green locker: ``Ben  
-- Pick me,'' it read, with four dashes, a blank, and then seven 
more dashes beneath it. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's funny. I didn't write it,'' Couples said. ``I would  
love to play on the team. I think anybody would.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The top 10 places on the 12-member team didn't change in the PGA  
Championship, despite No. 10 Jeff Maggert giving Bob Estes and 
Lehman an opening by not making the cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Estes, needing to finish in fifth place to make the team, came  
closest, getting as high as fourth Sunday before bogeying Nos. 16 
and 17 to drop into a tie for sixth. Lehman finished in a tie for 
34th. 
</P>
<P>
	While Lehman hoped for an invitation, the top 10 included PGA  
champion Tiger Woods, David Duval, Payne Stewart, Davis Love III, 
Mark O'Meara, Hal Sutton, Justin Leonard, Jim Furyk, Phil Mickelson 
and Maggert. 
</P>
<P>
	Which leaves Crenshaw with his two captain's picks -- and one big  
headache trying to figure out who should get them. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's just a lot going on,'' Crenshaw said, looking a little  
harried. ``It is tough. Whomever I pick knows they have to step up 
and try to do their very best job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crenshaw could forget Stricker and Huston. Neither has played  
well this year, and they don't have any experience. He had already 
hinted he would use one pick on Lehman, a two-time Ryder Cup 
member, if Lehman didn't make it on points. 
</P>
<P>
	Lehman plays well at courses like The Country Club in Brookline,  
Mass., where the Ryder Cup matches will be played Sept. 24-26. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope it's true,'' Lehman said of being a captain's pick. ``I  
definitely would be honored to be picked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couples was another matter. He's been on every U.S. team since  
1989, and his five Ryder Cup berths are the most among active 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike Lehman, who added tournaments to get more Ryder Cup  
points -- he played the Greater Milwaukee Open rather than heading 
to the British Open a week early -- the PGA was Couples' first 
tournament since the end of June. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I am chosen, I will play more,'' Couples said. ``I will  
practice. These are things that make you work harder. I have a 
funny feeling if I'm chosen, I won't have any problem playing in 
the Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The European choices aren't nearly as messy, but captain Mark  
James also has another week and another tournament before he has to 
make his decisions. Sergio Garcia, who was in 12th place, helped 
him out by playing his way onto the team with the runner-up finish 
to Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	Jesper Parnevik, Bernhard Langer and even the aging Nick Faldo  
are possibilities, but James isn't giving any clues as to what 
he'll do. He won't even say whether he'll play if he makes the team 
on points. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have, yes,'' he said when asked if he'd made a decision.  
``That's yet to be announced.''

<HEADLINE> Cisco Systems Is Buying Calista </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Cisco Systems Inc., a leading maker of  
computer networking equipment, announced today it is acquiring 
privately held Calista Inc., a provider of Internet-based phone 
technology, for $55 million in stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Calista, based in Bucks, England and San Jose, develops  
technology that allows phone systems from different vendors to work 
together over networks built on Internet standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition enables San Jose-based Cisco to offer its  
customers the ability to transmit data, voice and video services 
across the Internet rather than over traditional phone lines, the 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
	The transaction is expected to close by the end of October.

<HEADLINE> India Said Can Build Neutron Bomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- India can build a neutron bomb and  
nuclear weapons of ``any type or size,'' scientists who planned 
last year's nuclear tests said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Rajagopal Chidambaram, chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission,  
said it would not be difficult to build neutron bombs, which 
produce a smaller blast than conventional nuclear weapons but have 
more intense radiation. Neutron bombs limit structural damage while 
killing large numbers of people. 
</P>
<P>
	Anil Kakodkar, director of the Bhabha Atomic Research Center,  
said India had declared a moratorium on nuclear tests after its 
five underground explosions in May 1998, but had not stopped its 
nuclear weapons research. 
</P>
<P>
	``The research is on. We have not stopped,'' Kakodkar was quoted  
as saying by Press Trust of India. He gave no details. 
</P>
<P>
	India says it needs a minimum nuclear deterrent to arm itself  
against possible attacks by its neighbors, Pakistan to the west and 
China to the north. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid U.S. charges of atomic spying, China declared last month it  
possessed its own neutron bomb. Zhao Qizheng, the chief government 
spokesman, said Chinese scientists developed neutron bombs and 
miniaturized atomic warheads in the 1970s and '80s.

<HEADLINE> Woods-Garcia May Be Rivalry for Ages  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) -- The only thing that could top the drama of  
the final round in the PGA Championship would be for Tiger Woods 
and Sergio Garcia to meet at The Country Club with the Ryder Cup on 
the line. 
</P>
<P>
	That's out of Ben Crenshaw's control since the draw is blind for  
the Sunday singles matches, but the U.S. captain couldn't stop 
talking about them. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the future of golf,'' Crenshaw said Monday. ``And I  
think as far as drama, it's in pretty safe hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The final major championship of the 20th century may have been a  
sneak preview to the first part of the next 100 years. All that 
separated Woods and Garcia at Medinah Country Club was four years 
and one stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods, 23, became the youngest player since Seve Ballesteros in  
1980 to win two majors. Two par putts -- the one Garcia missed on 
the 16th and the one Woods made on the 17th -- kept the 19-year-old 
Spaniard from becoming the youngest major winner in 131 years. 
</P>
<P>
	If the dream pairing in the Ryder Cup doesn't pan out, then the  
Masters can't get here soon enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivalries are born in the majors, and this one came out kicking  
and screaming. Woods nearly squandered a five-stroke lead with 
seven holes to play, but won the PGA Championship by a stroke with 
a routine two-putt for par on the last hole. 
</P>
<P>
	It left him so mentally spent it was all Woods could do to raise  
the Wanamaker Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	``To come out of it on top took everything out of me,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Woods has been part of every rivalry equation since becoming the  
youngest Masters champion in 1997. Garcia is a natural match, given 
his confidence and charisma. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sergio and I play very similar games,'' Woods said. ``We are  
both very aggressive, both hit the ball a long ways and both like 
to be creative. I know what he's thinking out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia has a selection of shots matched only by his mentor,  
Ballesteros. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's Seve with a smile,'' Tom Lehman said.  
</P>
<P>
	And like Ballesteros, Garcia defined his swashbuckling style  
with a single shot on the grandest stage in golf. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballesteros was also a 19-year-old in only his second major as a  
professional when he finished second behind Johnny Miller in the 
1976 British Open. But he became the buzz of Royal Birkdale by 
threading a chip shot through two bunkers on the 18th to save par. 
</P>
<P>
	The shot that defines the kid -- ``El Nino'' -- was even more  
spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one has ever seen a shot like that,'' Crenshaw said.  
</P>
<P>
	Trailing Woods by one stroke on the 16th hole, Garcia's tee shot  
landed between two roots next to one of the 4,161 trees on Medinah. 
He had to get the ball off the ground, around the trees and onto 
the front of an elevated green 176 yards away -- all this without 
killing himself, or at least having the ball hit him for a 
two-stroke penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just closed my eyes, hit the ball and went backwards just in  
case the ball hit the tree and comes into me,'' Garcia said. ``And 
well, then I opened my eyes and I saw the ball going to the green. 
And I was pretty excited there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So was everyone watching.  
</P>
<P>
	``When he hit that shot on 16, he captured America's imagination  
and heart,'' Crenshaw said. ``He's magic, he's charismatic, he's 
graceful. What a kid. What a fabulous kid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is everything Woods once was -- and now must become what Woods  
is for a true rivalry to take golf into the next millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	While Garcia won the hearts of Chicago, Woods won the prize that  
mattered most. Woods is still 16 majors behind Jack Nicklaus, but 
he is also two ahead of Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said when I turned pro that I wanted to be the No. 1 golfer  
in the world,'' Garcia said. ``And so I knew I was going to be a 
rival for Tiger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, this was no ``Showdown at Sherwood.''  
</P>
<P>
	As badly as everyone wanted to make a rivalry out of Woods and  
David Duval, they never staged anything close to what took place at 
Medinah. Garcia looking up at Woods from the 13th green and then 
staring him down was as good as it gets. 
</P>
<P>
	``No doubt, we saw something in Sergio that is absolutely  
electrifying and captivating,'' Crenshaw said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not to be lost is the utter dominance by Woods this summer, the  
result of two years fine-tuning a swing with coach Butch Harmon 
that should last for at least the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	His victory in the PGA Championship was his fourth in his last  
seven tournaments since his post-Masters break. He finished no 
worse than a tie for seventh in the others, and that includes two 
majors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've sat on the range for countless hours hitting balls, by  
ourselves, no one around, and putting in time that people don't 
see,'' Woods said. ``It took a little while before everything came 
together. And once it did, I'm starting to reap the benefits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That might have been easier to recognize had he won the PGA  
Championship without such a fight put up by someone so young and so 
similar. 
</P>
<P>
	As it was, the PGA Championship was very much like the British  
Open in one respect -- it may be remembered as much for the guy who 
finished second.

<HEADLINE>  Air France Blames Traffic for Delays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Air traffic delays have made the summer of 1999  
``catastrophic'' for passengers, and things will get worse unless 
European governments take swift action, the president of Air France 
said in an interview published Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean-Cyril Spinetta said delays have cost the French carrier  
one-third of a million dollars a day so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said air companies aren't always to blame, and that 75  
percent of delays are due to inadequate European air traffic 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	``The summer of 1999 has been the most catastrophic of the last  
10 years,'' Spinetta was quoted as saying by the newspaper Le 
Parisien. ``In Europe, delays per passenger have increased by 66.7 
percent since 1998.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The International Air Traffic Association has urged governments  
to create a ``borderless European sky,'' so as to ease congestion. 
It says air traffic delays have reached ``crisis level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A plane whose flight plan is changed in Milan and which  
doesn't take off on time can have a series of delays in Roissy 
(Paris) or London,'' Spinetta was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	He said airline personnel as a result are ``powerless'' when  
faced with an angry public. 
</P>
<P>
	``Different governments must implement an efficient European air  
control system,'' he said. ``Unless a decision is taken quickly, 
the increase in air traffic ... will make navigation even more 
difficult and the delays will get even worse 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot build Europe and multiply air traffic without  
worrying about sky congestion problems,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spinetta said the Kosovo conflict was another reason for flight  
delays.

	LONDON (AP) -- European stocks closed higher Monday, with  
technology shares boosted by gains in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume was thin, however, with investors sidelined ahead of the  
U.S. consumer price index, scheduled for release Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 592 European companies rose 1.18

Stoxx Index, which tracks 297 companies in countries that joined 
the single currency, closed up 1.27 points at 319.02. 
</P>
<P>
	Among European bourses, Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index closed up  
0.7 percent to 5,257.50 as MAN gained 1.45 euros to close at 33.89 
euros, on fresh speculation that the group is eyeing Fiat's Iveco 
and Renault's truck division as potential partners for its 
commercial vehicles operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Paris CAC-40 index closed up 0.6 percent to 4,458.75, but  
banking stocks came under pressure as the market awaits a final 
decision on the banking takeover battle between Banque National de 
Paris and both Societe Generale and Paribas.

	In London, the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares fell 0.2  
percent, to 6,235.4.

	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index rose 14.11 points to 3724.68,

one-third of a million dollars a day so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said air companies aren't always to blame, and that 75  
percent of delays are due to inadequate European air traffic 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	``The summer of 1999 has been the most catastrophic of the last  
10 years,'' Spinetta was quoted as saying by the newspaper Le 
Parisien. ``In Europe, delays per passenger have increased by 66.7 
percent since 1998.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The International Air Traffic Association has urged governments  
to create a ``borderless European sky,'' so as to ease congestion. 
It says air traffic delays have reached ``crisis level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A plane whose flight plan is changed in Milan and which  
doesn't take off on time can have a series of delays in Roissy 
(Paris) or London,'' Spinetta was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	He said airline personnel as a result are ``powerless'' when  
faced with an angry public. 
</P>
<P>
	``Different governments must implement an efficient European air  
control system,'' he said. ``Unless a decision is taken quickly, 
the increase in air traffic ... will make navigation even more 
difficult and the delays will get even worse 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot build Europe and multiply air traffic without  
worrying about sky congestion problems,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spinetta said the Kosovo conflict was another reason for flight  
delays.

<HEADLINE> Gulf of Mexico Damage Repair Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farmers worry that a government study of the  
Gulf of Mexico's oxygen-deprived ``dead zone'' could lead to curbs 
on fertilizer and land use in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Every year an area of the gulf as big as New Jersey becomes  
depleted of oxygen, or ``hypoxic,'' because of the heavy flow of 
nitrogen and other nutrients down the Mississippi River. 
Fertilizers used on Midwestern farms are blamed for much of the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy  
completed the study this spring. It is to propose recommendations 
this fall and issue a final report next spring for Congress and 
state governments to consider. 
</P>
<P>
	The study concluded that the most cost-effective way to protect  
the gulf would be to reduce fertilizer use by 20 percent and to 
restore 5 million acres of wetlands that could trap nutrients 
before they reach the Mississippi and its tributaries. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Farm Bureau Federation sees no justification for  
doing that. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists ``have not established an identifiable, variable link  
between nitrogen fertilizer and the hypoxic zone,'' the federation 
said in comments filed with the White House science office. ``No 
one has defined what the impact of a cutback in nitrogen fertilizer 
would be on the nitrate levels in the Mississippi River.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the study could not identify damage to gulf fisheries  
because of oxygen depletion, it warned that they will ``decline, 
perhaps precipitously,'' if the gulf suffers the same fate as the 
Black Sea and other hypoxic areas around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's very little question about whether or not the loads of  
nitrogen and other nutrients in the Mississippi River drive the 
dynamics of the hypoxic zone,'' said Don Scavia, overseeing the 
report as director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration's National Ocean Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists are trying to figure out which areas of the  
Mississippi basin to target for controlling the pollution and the 
best way to do that, he said Monday. ``To the extent this is going 
to affect agriculture, we want to make sure it's not disruptive,'' 
Scavia said. 
</P>
<P>
	The gulf's ``dead zone'' doubled in size to about 7,000 square  
miles after widespread Midwest flooding in 1993. This summer it 
expanded to 7,728 square miles, about 700 square miles larger than 
the previously recorded maximum of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Algae thrives on the excess nutrients and hogs the oxygen in the  
water that is needed by fish, shrimp and other aquatic life. The 
Mississippi River drains water from about 40 percent of the United 
States and carries more than a million tons of nitrogen.

<HEADLINE> Former Ill. Detective Convicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A former police detective has been convicted of  
conspiracy and extortion for taking part in more than a decade of 
shakedowns and payoffs in corruption-plagued Cicero in suburban 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Darlene Sobczak, 42, was found guilty Monday following four days  
of testimony last week before U.S. District Judge Suzanne Conlon. 
</P>
<P>
	The former police officer, who joined the police force in 1984  
and left last year, is scheduled to be sentenced Oct. 27. 
Prosecutors estimate she'll receive a three- to five-year prison 
term. 
</P>
<P>
	Sobczak was convicted of plotting with another former Cicero  
detective, Robert Biziarek, to get payoffs, starting as far back as 
the mid-1980s and continuing until August 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Biziarek has pleaded guilty. He is to be sentenced Oct. 7.  
</P>
<P>
	Many of those who paid police to stay out of jail were Gypsies  
who were picked up in Cicero on a variety of real and trumped up 
charges, prosecutors said. Four Gypsies took the stand as 
prosecution witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Sobczak attorneys argued that the government's witnesses were  
not truthful and that the former police officer had been unfairly 
roped into matters that she had nothing to do with.

<HEADLINE> Dow Corning President Is Named CEO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIDLAND, Mich. (AP) -- Dow Corning Corp. announced Monday that  
president Gary Anderson, who guided the company through bankruptcy 
due to claims over silicone breast implants, has been named chief 
executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson replaces Richard Hazleton, who will remain chairman of  
the company's board of directors. In a statement, Hazleton said the 
move was part of a succession plan for Dow Corning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gary has done an exemplary job of leading this company through  
the Chapter 11 process, and now, with that hopefully approaching 
closure, it is appropriate that he assume the role of CEO to lead 
Dow Corning into the next century,'' Hazleton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow Corning, which was once the largest supplier of silicone  
used in breast implants, filed for bankruptcy in 1995 after 19,000 
women sued the company, blaming implants for a variety of health 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearings on Dow Corning's $4.5 billion bankruptcy plan ended  
last month. The plan includes a $3.2 billion settlement for 
hundreds of thousands of women with implants. A judge must approve 
the plan, though it's unclear when his ruling might be made. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow Corning no longer makes silicone breast implants, but still  
produces thousands of silicone-based products. Last year, it earned 
$207 million on revenue of $2.6 billion, with more than half its 
sales coming from foreign markets. The company is co-owned by The 
Dow Chemical Co. and Corning Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson holds a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from  
Michigan Technological University and an MBA from Central Michigan 
University. He joined the company in 1967, and has worked as 
president since September 1994.

<HEADLINE> Packers' Freeman Gets $42M Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Antonio Freeman became the NFL's  
highest-paid wide receiver Monday, agreeing to a seven-year, $42 
million contract with the Green Bay Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman's agent, Joel Segal, told The Associated Press the deal  
also includes a $10 million signing bonus, the largest ever paid to 
a wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a landmark contract,'' Segal said. ``This is something  
that's never been done before. It breaks the ice for all the other 
receivers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The contract includes two voidable years, meaning the All-Pro  
wideout can opt out of the deal after five seasons. The contract is 
contingent on Freeman playing in 25 percent of the Packers' 
offensive plays in any season. 
</P>
<P>
	Contracts for wide receivers historically have lagged behind  
those for other skill position players, in part because of the 
higher likelihood of injury at the position. But the Packers felt 
Freeman was an impact player who deserved top dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was everything I hoped and dreamed,'' Freeman said of the  
contract. ``I'm just happy to be a Green Bay Packer for a long, 
long time to come. I love it here, and I always wanted to be 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit receiver Herman Moore signed a five-year, $28 million  
contract extension in July that included a signing bonus between $8 
million and $9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman's signing bonus is the second largest ever paid by the  
Packers, who gave quarterback Brett Favre a $12 million bonus in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the 1998 season, the Packers offered Freeman a five-year,  
$17 million contract with a signing bonus of just over $3 million. 
Freeman rejected the deal, choosing instead to play for the team's 
tender offer of $1.153 million and become a free agent at season's 
end. 
</P>
<P>
	The gamble paid off spectacularly. Freeman set career-highs with  
84 catches for 14 touchdowns and a league-best 1,424 yards, despite 
breaking his jaw late in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The variables we took into consideration paid off,'' Segal  
said. ``This deal brings receivers into the big-money contracts 
going into the new millennium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers designated Freeman as their franchise player, and  
the team worked with Segal to reach agreement on a long-term deal. 
Freeman held out through the first two weeks on training camp, but 
on Friday, with his contract all but completed, he signed a 
tender-offer deal allowing him to join camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Segal came to Green Bay on Sunday and hammered out the final  
details of the contract on Monday morning. The voidable years on 
the deal were the final hurdle, and the agreement was finalized 
shortly before the Packers' afternoon workout. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was really no need for animosity,'' Freeman said of the  
negotiations. ``I took into consideration a lot of past deals I've 
seen ... where negotiations really get nasty and the fans and the 
media take a different view of that player. That's something I 
wanted to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want the fans thinking I was a greedy guy. I just  
tried to remain respectful through the negotiation period, and the 
Green Bay Packers did as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman briefly participated in drills on Monday morning, but  
will spend most of the week working with strength and conditioning 
coach Barry Rubin. Freeman won't play in Green Bay's exhibition 
game against the Denver Broncos next Monday, coach Ray Rhodes said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He really is the leader of the receiver group,'' Rhodes said.  
``Our players love him because of his work ethic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Segal's Worldwide Entertainment and Sports also closed lucrative  
deals for receivers Charles Johnson in Philadelphia and O.J. 
McDuffie in Miami during the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman's signing allows the Packers to breathe a sigh of relief  
about their depth at wide receiver. With Robert Brooks' retirement 
last month, Green Bay entered training camp with Bill Schroeder, 
Derrick Mayes and Corey Bradford as their top wideouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Offensive coordinator Sherman Lewis said Freeman will be able to  
easily fit back into his old role with the team. Lewis also is 
considering using Freeman, normally a split end, at flanker this 
season, a position he has played sporadically in the last three 
years.

<HEADLINE> Summer Break a Hollowed Tradition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Playing a fish rising in cool waters, whacking  
a small white ball down a green fairway, piloting a sailboat off a 
breezy coast, America's chief executives have been getting away 
from it all ever since the presidency began. 
</P>
<P>
	Theodore Roosevelt rode horses and hunted. John Kennedy sailed.  
William Howard Taft, Dwight Eisenhower, George Bush and Bill 
Clinton golfed. Ronald Reagan rode horses and cut brush on his 
California ranch, liking it so much he was there for 335 days of 
his eight-year presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Harry Truman played poker late into the night with cronies on  
the south porch of his quarters at Key West, Fla. The official 
White House log said he ``visited with members of his party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some presidents just returned to the comforts of home -- homes  
with names like Mount Vernon, Monticello, Montpelier, Sagamore 
Hill, Hyde Park and the LBJ Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, Bill and Hillary Clinton embark on their seventh  
presidential vacation, returning for the fifth time to the 
Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard. It's a split-decision 
vacation. They'll move on at month's end to New York's Finger Lakes 
in a state where the first lady will likely seek a Senate seat next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Vacations have generally been a good thing for presidents.  
</P>
<P>
	Truman liked the warm sun and blue waters of Key West so much  
that he said he wished he could move the government there ``and 
just stay.'' As it was, he spent 175 vacation days on the southern 
tip of Florida over seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	Eisenhower was so pleased with golf in Augusta, Ga., that he  
visited 29 times for a total of 222 days during eight years as 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Calvin Coolidge learned to fish while vacationing on the lakes  
of northern Wisconsin. He spent the entire summer of 1927 in a 
rustic lodge in the Black Hills of South Dakota and drew headlines 
after a public spat with his wife when she returned hours late from 
a hike in the woods with a handsome Secret Service agent, blameless 
but flustered. 
</P>
<P>
	Coolidge jolted reporters later that summer by handing out typed  
notes reading, ``I do not choose to run for president in 1928.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abraham Lincoln found a stone cottage at the Soldiers' Home a  
short carriage ride from the White House a perfect escape. 
</P>
<P>
	Grover Cleveland used a vacation getaway in the summer of 1893  
to give reporters the slip and schedule secret surgery to remove a 
cancerous growth in his mouth. Fearing that news of his condition 
could be used to undermine his economic recovery program, Cleveland 
had the operation performed on board a yacht steaming to his summer 
home at Buzzards Bay, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	When Theodore Roosevelt visited Yellowstone National Park in the  
early 1900s, reporters were told to stay away. One persistent 
correspondent rode in, accompanied by a dog. 
</P>
<P>
	Retribution was not long in coming. The reporter was arrested,  
The New York Times reported on its front page. The horse was 
confiscated. The dog was shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite being swatted away at times, reporters have swarmed  
after vacationing presidents for most of the century. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's vacations have generally followed the golf course,  
with an occasional celebrity sail followed by leisurely dinners out 
and perhaps a walk to an ice cream shop. 
</P>
<P>
	The president took the advice of consultant Dick Morris and  
spent his summer vacation time in 1995 and 1996 golfing and hiking 
against the backdrop of the Grand Teton Mountains at Jackson Hole, 
Wyo. Voters like outdoor, western family vacations. Morris had 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	On most Clinton vacations the buzz of the summer was how many  
mulligans -- repeat strokes -- the president took on the golf course, 
or what books he had read. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer the world came with him to peaceful Martha's  
Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons arrived just hours after the president's nationally  
televised speech acknowledging he'd had a relationship with Monica 
Lewinsky that was ``not appropriate'' and had ``misled people, 
including even my wife.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an abrupt change of pace, Clinton switched from casual attire  
and appeared before reporters in a crisp white shirt, dark suit and 
grave voice to announce he had just ordered U.S. forces to strike 
terrorist facilities in Afghanistan and Sudan to retaliate for 
bombings of the American embassies in those countries. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, golf is expected to again dominate the president's  
vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	And mulligans are back in style.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Down, Tokyo Share prices Up / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Selling by Japanese exporters drove the dollar  
slightly lower against the yen today while Tokyo stocks surged in 
line with big gains on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 114.84 yen in late-afternoon trading, down  
0.08 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and below its late New York 
level of 115.74 yen Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average jumped 390.86  
points, or 2.24 percent, to close at 17,826.03. On Friday, the 
average finished up 12.20 points, or 0.07 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese exporters, such as automakers, sold dollars for yen to  
lock in profits for the first half of the fiscal year ending 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	``Japanese exporters were aggressive in selling dollars,'' said  
Shigeru Hashimoto, vice president of foreign exchange at Sanwa 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Surging stocks also pushed the yen higher as Japanese investors  
dumped foreign assets and rushed back into yen to get in on the 
rally, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar traded as high as 115.90 yen and as low as 114.62 in  
Asian trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 121.58 yen, down  
from 122.76 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, international blue-chip issues marked  
strong gains in line with a surge in share prices in the United 
States last week. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average picked up  
184.26 points Friday to close at 10,973.65. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's big blue chip stocks often rise in tandem with Wall  
Street because they do much of their business in the United States 
and their fates are closely linked to those of U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
	But some market participants doubted the rally would continue in  
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the gain came from speculative trading that had a  
disproportionately large impact due to low volumes, said Kiyoshi 
Kimura, strategist at Societe Generale. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was light as many market participants had yet to return  
from summer vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 26.02 points, or 1.80 percent, to 1,468.51. The 
TOPIX closed up 4.05 points, or 0.03 percent, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was  
estimated at 378.53 million shares, down from 455.06 million shares 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 214 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.9350 percent from Friday's finish of 1.8550 percent, 
driving its price down to 98.86 yen from 99.53 yen.

<HEADLINE>  Albanians Call Off Kosovo Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Ethnic Albanians called  
off a protest today in this tensely divided Kosovo town, averting a 
potentially violent confrontation with NATO peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	The demonstration was canceled after U.N. and NATO officials  
reached a deal with ethnic Albanians allowing 25 families per day 
to return to homes they lost in the Serb-dominated portion of 
Kosovska Mitrovica during the Kosovo conflict, all sides said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement was a positive development in the city, where  
ethnic Albanians clashed several times last week with French 
peacekeepers preventing them from crossing the bridge that divides 
the city's ethnic Albanian and Serb neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	Another favorable event was the arrival early today in Kosovo  
Polje of some 200 Serb railway workers -- the largest known group of 
Serbs returning to Kosovo since June. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the 200,000 Serbs had fled to escape the wrath of ethnic  
Albanians infuriated by atrocities and torching of their homes by 
Serb forces who pulled out in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Bajram Rexhepi, mayor of the ethnic Albanian sector in Kosovska  
Mitrovica, announced the compromise deal to a crowd of some 150 
people who had gathered near the bridge for the scheduled protest 
on the bridge over the Ibar River. 
</P>
<P>
	The local commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army, Rrahman Rama,  
dressed in a camouflage uniform with the rebel group's badge, waded 
through the crowd, telling people to go home. 
</P>
<P>
	Some would-be demonstrators were confused, others clearly angry  
at the cancellation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sleeping in a front yard with my eight children. So how  
can somebody stop me from going to my home. We shouldn't listen to 
anybody. We should just cross this bridge and go to our homes.'' 
Jashar Osmani, 52, said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Albanians had originally wanted 100 families a day to go  
back, Rexhepi said. About 1,200 families were waiting to go back to 
the Serb-dominated side, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary-Pat Silveira, the deputy U.N. chief in the city, said the  
informal proposal had received ``tacit agreement'' from the Serb 
side. The arrangement was reached in talks between U.N. and NATO 
officials, Rexhepi and a Serb delegation. 
</P>
<P>
	Silveira said she hoped that some families could begin returning  
this week. However, some of the homes are now occupied by other 
displaced people, in some cases Serbs, and officials have to find 
alternative shelters for the current residents before the Albanians 
return, she said. ``We will not put people out in the street,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was also unclear how much protection the ethnic Albanians  
will receive once they return to their homes. They will be escorted 
back by French peacekeepers, and a U.N.-NATO committee will make 
daily visits to ensure they are all right, Silveira said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, three buses crossed the border between  
Yugoslavia and Kosovo, carrying 200 Serbs returning to Kosovo Polje 
to start working at the local railroad station. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the workers, Andjelka Sup, said she had left Kosovo  
alongside Serb forces and now returns with KFOR, the name of the 
international peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will start working immediately and I hope that KFOR will  
bring more people here so that they provide more security,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In another step in U.N. efforts to create a pluralistic society  
amid Kosovo's ethnic hatreds, 50 ethnic Albanian and Serbian judges 
agreed to form a commission to draw up a new, democratic body of 
laws for the Serb province, said U.N. spokeswoman Nadia Younes. 
Some Albanian judges had threatened to step down rather than 
enforce laws that discriminated against ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	The violence and lawlessness that has plagued the NATO-led  
mission continued, however. A patrol of German peacekeepers were 
fired on by a group of men they stopped to demand identity papers 
on Sunday. One peacekeeper was hit but saved by his flak jacket.

	In Belgrade, one of the closest allies of Yugoslav President  
Slobodan Milosevic resigned after criticizing his policies. 
Bogoljub Karic had been a Serbian government minister without 
portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition has been growing against Milosevic, fueled by anger  
at policies that many in the public blame for the 78-day NATO 
bombing, Yugoslavia's international isolation and its economic 
problems.

<HEADLINE> Astros' Moises Alou Recovery Slowed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Moises Alou might not make it back into the  
Houston Astros' lineup by his target date of Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Star left fielder has missed the entire season since  
wrecking his left knee in a treadmill accident before spring 
training. He had hoped to join the Astros by the start of next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult to put a timetable on a severe injury,''  
general manager Gerry Hunsicker said Monday. ``He had set his 
sights on Sept. 1 for a return but now it looks like it will take 
longer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunsicker had hoped Alou could go on a rehab assignment in the  
minors before Sept. 1, when the minor league season ends. 
</P>
<P>
	``After Sept. 1, it would be more difficult to get him rehab  
work,'' Hunsicker said. ``We'd have to create some simulated games 
here to try and get him ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two-time NL Central champions are three percentage points  
behind Cincinnati in the division race.

<HEADLINE> Sampras Rebounds from French Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MASON, Ohio (AP) -- Pete Sampras has found an antidote for the  
depression he suffers after losing the French Open. It's called 
winning. 
</P>
<P>
	Every year Sampras loses -- often early -- at Roland Garros and  
has to hear the same old thing about tanking the big one on clay. 
This year was particularly painful, the loss coinciding with a 
breakup with a longtime girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Up until the French Open and after the French, I was about as  
low as I've ever been, personally and professionally,'' Sampras 
said Sunday. ``It was a very tough time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he went home to Orlando, Fla., to collect himself, he  
decided a new outlook was needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I looked at Queen's and the rest of the year as a new  
beginning and tried to put what happened at the French behind me 
and the whole year just behind me,'' Sampras said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I learned from it. That's a sign, or a time, to really show  
your true colors when things aren't going well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He went to London to play in the Queen's Club, a grass court  
tournament, to get ready for Wimbledon. He won there and hasn't 
stopped since, adding titles at Wimbledon -- his sixth -- Los Angeles 
and the ATP Championship in Mason. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since Queen's, winning that tournament and getting the  
confidence I needed to get going in Wimbledon, it's just kind of 
all just carrying over to the summer,'' Sampras said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a big relief winning Wimbledon because I felt like I  
achieved my main goal this year, which was to win a Grand Slam 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just riding the wave, and I hope that wave doesn't crash  
anytime soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's straight-set victory over Patrick Rafter gave Sampras  
the 60th title of his career. He'll play at Indianapolis this week, 
then take a week off before the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know what I have to do at the Open, but this definitely  
helps,'' Sampras said. ``There's no question that to win tough 
matches and to beat the top players in the world is what I'm trying 
to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The streak of 22 consecutive wins is the second longest of his  
career. He won 29 in a row in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first three or four months of the year, I was struggling  
and not really playing much,'' Sampras said. ``I felt like my game 
wasn't really in sync.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras was exhausted from a December push to finish the year at  
No. 1 -- something he says he won't do again now that he has 
finished the year at No. 1 a record six times. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not play in January, passing up the Australian Open,  
although he has won it twice and his goal is to amass Grand Slam 
tournament titles. 
</P>
<P>
	He suffered an ankle injury and withdrew from the only  
tournament he entered in February, and he had a miserable early 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	He made it to the quarterfinals at Key Biscayne, Fla., but lost  
to Richard Krajicek for the fourth consecutive time. He took off 
nearly two months, then lost in the second round at Rome and then 
to Rafter -- for the third consecutive time -- in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came the French Open, where Sampras lost to Andrei  
Medvedev, at the time ranked 100th in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	But this past week gave Sampras a chance to settle some old  
scores. In successive matches, he beat his nemesis Krajicek, 
longtime rival Andre Agassi and Rafter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look at the Krajicek match as a hurdle because he's been  
pretty dominant in blowing me off the court a couple times,'' 
Sampras said. ``And Pat beat me the last three times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rafter said Sampras had definitely elevated his game.  
</P>
<P>
	``Pete never let me play well, it's as simple as that,'' Rafter  
said. ``I couldn't get into the game. He just served too big and 
too hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras served 12 aces, landing 67 percent of his first serves.  
In the first-set tiebreaker, one serve broke four strings on 
Rafter's racket. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras said he was surprised that so many of his serves were  
clocked over 130 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played at a time when it was hot and dry and the ball was  
going through the air very quick,'' Sampras said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only five players in the open era have more tournament titles  
than Sampras -- Jimmy Connors (109), Ivan Lendl (94), John McEnroe 
(77) and Bjorn Borg and Guillermo Vilas (62). 
</P>
<P>
	Winning the ATP Championship kept Sampras at No. 1 for a record  
273rd week. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just get into a certain rhythm, and my rhythm is there at  
the moment,'' Sampras said. ``The challenge is just trying to 
maintain it for the next couple of weeks.''

<HEADLINE> Alexander To Quit Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander  
ended his presidential campaign today after finishing poorly in 
Saturday's Iowa straw poll. 
</P>
<P>
	``My heart my heart tells me to keep going and so do a lot of  
telephone calls this morning, but there's really no realistic way 
to do that,'' said Alexander, flanked by his wife and son at the 
state Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	There also were troubling signs for former Vice President Dan  
Quayle, who was surprised today with the desertion of campaign 
leaders in South Carolina, a critical GOP primary state. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rats may be jumping off the ship, but the ship isn't  
sinking,'' said Quayle spokesman Jonathan Baron. 
</P>
<P>
	Having campaigned almost nonstop for six years, Alexander had  
waged an all-out battle for the weekend straw vote, but placed a 
meager sixth. He appeared resigned but lighthearted as he faced a 
crowd of news cameras this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I may learn a lesson from this. I seem to be attracting more  
attention getting out than I did getting in,'' he said, joking that 
his immediate plans included perfect attendance at University of 
Tennessee football games. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander did not endorse any of his remaining rivals, but said  
he hoped they would adopt his signature proposals on education and 
expanded tax deductions for families. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that the successful Republican nominee for president of  
the United States -- whoever he or she may be -- does a remarkably 
good job of bringing out the best in our country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, 59, did not endorse any of his remaining rivals, but  
said he hoped they would adopt his signature proposals on education 
and expanded tax deductions for families. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, who ran unsuccessfully for president in 1996, had  
focused all his energies on the initial caucus state. He received 
1,428 out of 25,549 votes cast in the straw poll. 
</P>
<P>
	That contest was won by Texas Gov. George W. Bush, whose  
front-running campaign has dried up Alexander's fund-raising 
sources and competed for the same base of moderate Republican 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush stands to benefit from today's announcement, because many  
Alexander supporters could be expected to shift to Bush. Sen. John 
McCain of Arizona and former American Red Cross president Elizabeth 
Dole, who finished a strong third in Saturday's poll, also may pick 
up some Alexander backers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor is expected to pick up most of Alexander's  
fund-raising team and perhaps his top adviser in Iowa, former Gov . 
Terry Branstad. Michigan Gov. John Engler, a top Bush operative, 
has been courting Branstad, according to the Alexander officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle and his senior advisers rejected any talk that he, too,  
might quit, saying they purposely spent little money on the straw 
poll and were prepared for a poor showing. The vice president, they 
said, is determined to emerge as the only credible, conservative 
alternative to Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing has changed,'' Baron said.  
</P>
<P>
	Still, there was talk from some of his aides that his campaign  
might be short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's campaign announced today that he had signed up members  
of Quayle's team in South Carolina, including his campaign 
director. Spokesman Howard Opinsky said the moves had been 
discussed before the straw poll, but Quayle's poor showing sped up 
the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	According to angry Quayle aides, Edward McMullen Jr. and Jim  
Merrill submitted their resignations by fax with no warning, after 
McCain's campaign announced the departures. Merrill was Quayle's 
state director; McMullen was a critical supporter, but was never 
officially named chairman, the Quayle campaign said. 
</P>
<P>
	``With their help, we will challenge the status quo and begin to  
restore honesty and integrity back to our government,'' McCain 
said. ``Our common cause of conservative reform is key to restoring 
the nation's lack of confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush was elated about his straw poll win. ``We met our  
expectations,'' he declared Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokeswoman Karen Hughes told NBC that Bush is increasingly the  
target of rivals because ``they think he's well on the road to 
being the Republican nominee for the White House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Publisher Steve Forbes said his strong second-place showing  
means Bush must now engage him on issues and in serious campaign 
debate. ``So far, he (Bush) hasn't put a lot on the table,'' he 
said on ABC's ``This Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole gave her campaign a boost with a third-place showing. ``We  
have an invisible army, and that's another reason we won,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other clear developments emerged as strategists began assessing  
the impact of a straw poll that drew heated competition and 
millions of dollars in spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Commentator Pat Buchanan mounted a strong showing for the GOP  
nomination in the last election cycle but finished fifth in the 
straw poll. He dodged questions on CBS and Fox about whether he 
would bolt the party to run as an independent or third-party 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	And on NBC and CNN, Gary Bauer said his fourth-place showing  
solidified him as the leader of social conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, the only contender to skip the straw poll, said he might  
bypass Iowa's leadoff precinct caucuses next February as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now I'm leaning toward it,'' McCain said today on ABC's  
``Good Morning America'' when asked if he would skip Iowa. ``I'd 
like to see how the climate looks. ... New Hampshire is the 
first-in-the-nation status, South Carolina is right after that. ... 
I think they are of transcendent importance.''

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Co., Microsoft Sign Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. has signed a deal  
with the Brazilian media giant Globo to form a series of online 
joint ventures, the companies said late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft will pay $126 million in for an 11.5 percent stake in  
Globo's cable subsidiary, Globocabo, a Microsoft spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies will also sign technical cooperation agreements to  
explore delivery of WebTV, develop a joint Internet Service 
Provider and merge their respective Web portals in Brazil, the 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Globo President Roberto Marinho was quoted in a report by  
Globo's TV news network Monday as saying the company's ``quality of 
content'' and Microsoft's expertise in technology would benefit 
Brazilian consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Globo dominates pay and broadcast television in Brazil. Globo  
controls much of the nation's top broadcasting talent and produces 
its most watched television programs, including favorite soap 
operas and the country's top ranked news program. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet use in Brazil is growing rapidly. The country of almost  
170 million people has installed more than 11 million new phone 
lines within the last year and added more than one million Internet 
users, according to market researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently at around 3 million, the number of Brazilians  
accessing the Internet is expected to rise to 7 million in three 
years, and to account for 60 percent of all users in Latin America.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Exchanges Letters With Barak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Continuing to stay in touch, President Clinton  
and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak have exchanged letters 
exploring prospects for peacemaking in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wrote Barak over the weekend, responding to a letter the  
prime minister sent him about a week earlier, David Leavy, a White 
House spokesman, said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The two leaders also spoke twice last week on the telephone as  
Clinton tries to set the stage for a successful trip to the region 
beginning Sept. 1 by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinians have criticized Barak for stretching out the  
phases of an Israeli withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank 
under the U.S.-brokered Wye River peace accords. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton told a group of American Jewish leaders last week at  
the White House he expected an agreement between Israel and the 
Palestinians on a schedule within three weeks.

<HEADLINE> Sotomayor Must Answer Doping Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Track and field's world governing body  
rejected appeals by Cuban officials today and ruled that world high 
jump champion Javier Sotomayor must face doping charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor, the world-record holder in the high jump, tested  
positive for cocaine earlier this month at the Pan American Games 
in Winnipeg, Canada, and was stripped of his gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor has denied knowingly taking any banned drug. Cuban  
officials have supported him and suggested his test was manipulated 
as part of a conspiracy, possibly involving the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was discussed today at a meeting of the International  
Amateur Athletic Federation Council in Seville. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor was defended at the meeting by Cuba's delegate on the  
Council, former Olympic 400- and 800-meter champion Alberto 
Juantorena, who is head of Cuba's national athletics federation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The opinion of the Cubans is there is not a doping case,''  
IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri said. ``The opinion of the doping 
commission of the IAAF is that it is a doping case. They asked the 
Cuban federation to follow the normal procedure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF expects national federations to suspend any athlete  
testing positive for banned drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless the Cuban federation suspends Sotomayor, the IAAF could  
ban him, Reineri said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the spokesman said the case is not urgent because  
Sotomayor is scheduled to undergo surgery for a herniated disc in 
his lower back and has pulled out of the World Championships 
opening this weekend in Seville.

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays' Wells To Make Next Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Blue Jays' left-hander David Wells, who was  
scratched from his last start because of a stiff back, will make 
his scheduled start on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells missed his last start Friday. He threw on the side Monday  
and said his back was still sore but that he could still pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue Jays' right-hander Joey Hamilton, who has an impingement in  
his right shoulder, also threw on the side and plans to make his 
scheduled start Friday. Hamilton said he expects to pitch with the 
soreness for the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	He also admitted he pitched tentatively in his last start, when  
he gave up eight runs in just one-third of an inning. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's is scary because you can blow out your arm with one  
pitch,'' Hamilton said. ``I threw as hard as I could in the 
bullpen. I felt it when I threw my slider. It's just something I'm 
going to have to deal with.''

<HEADLINE> Fumes Overcome 9 at Senate Cafeteria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nine workers were taken to a hospital for  
treatment Monday after strong fumes were reported in the cafeteria 
of a Capitol office building. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the Everett M. Dirksen Senate Office Building was  
evacuated while a hazardous materials crew tried to find the source 
of the fumes. Checks for natural gas, carbon monoxide and other 
substances came up negative. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	``There was a very strong and somewhat noxious odor of onions in  
the area,'' said Officer James P. Rohane of the Capitol Police. But 
cafeteria workers were skeptical of that explanation. 
</P>
<P>
	The cafeteria reopened for lunch featuring ham, fried chicken,  
stir-fried shrimp and filet of sole. None of the dishes was 
prepared with copious amounts of onions, the workers said.

<HEADLINE> 'Jar' Characters Cast With Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The recriminations fly fast and furiously in  
``Jar the Floor,'' playwright Cheryl L. West's enchanting if 
overstuffed comedy that concerns four generations of black women. 
</P>
<P>
	The ladies have gathered for the 90th birthday celebration of  
MaDear, a flinty yet increasingly feeble matriarch whose 
descendants seem to bring out the worst in each other. Yet their 
bickering and their blowups produce some effective theatrics, 
guaranteed to please audiences who are after a good time. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because West has a flair for character, real people who  
stay with you after the curtain has come down. In ``Jar the 
Floor,'' she has created five distinctive women. And fortunately, 
the off-Broadway production currently on view at Second Stage has 
cast them with care. 
</P>
<P>
	Let's start with Lola, a brazen grandma played to the comic hilt  
by Lynne Thigpen. She sashays and struts her way around the stage 
with more than enough sass to spare, singing ``Whatever Lola wants, 
Lola gets.'' Watching the amazing Thigpen, you know she will. 
</P>
<P>
	Lola has had to contend with her mother, the 90-year-old MaDear,  
and her daughter, Maydee, a determined, embittered academic 
nervously awaiting news of a possible tenured position. 
</P>
<P>
	Maydee is also awaiting the arrival of her own daughter, the  
college-age Vennie. Vennie eventually does show up, along with a 
white girlfriend named Raisa. 
</P>
<P>
	The complications may be predictable but director Marion  
McClinton knows how to keep things lively. Thigpen gets ample 
support from the rest of the fine cast. 
</P>
<P>
	Regina Taylor may be saddled with the play's sourest character,  
the self-sacrificing Maydee, but the actress invests the role with 
a dignity and common sense that takes her beyond being just a 
scold. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Powell plays Maydee's lesbian daughter with the right  
amount of petulance. She, too, doesn't get off easy as West creates 
another woman whose frailities inevitably get an airing. 
</P>
<P>
	These battles reach a head in Act 2 with a piling on of  
problems. Abortion, sexual molestation, abandonment. They all get 
ample discussion. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet walking along with the heartache is a lot of humor, too.  
There is something quite wonderful in the reaching across 
generations, particularly in a scene between great-grandmother 
MaDear (a terrific Irma P. Hall) and the young white girl, sweetly 
played by Welker White. They discuss their tribulations -- Raisa, a 
bout with breast cancer and MaDear, the fact of having lived as 
long as she has. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite its obviousness, the moment is filled with a gentle,  
good-natured comic spirit. Much like a lot of ``Jar the Floor.''

<HEADLINE> Iowa Poll a Momentum Boost for Bush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush threw down a  
gauntlet to the Republican presidential field with a clear and 
convincing victory in a battle he had been advised to duck. 
</P>
<P>
	In some ways, the story line of the upcoming campaign will be  
how those rivals respond to the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	``The race is now George W. Bush's to lose,'' said Drake  
University political scientist Hugh Winebrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush started late, raised the bar of expectations by vowing to  
win Saturday's straw poll against candidates building toward the 
event for months, and then did precisely that. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have more than accomplished what we set out to do,'' an  
elated Bush declared. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no way to say this is anything but a solid win,''  
Michigan Gov. John Engler said as the strategists and campaigns 
began to assess a straw poll eagerly awaited by many to take the 
measure of a large and diverse Republican field. 
</P>
<P>
	Publisher Steve Forbes met one challenge, and then found himself  
confronted immediately by another. He demonstrated that an 
expensive and intensive grass-roots campaign could land him a 
second-place showing, and he was arguing that set him up as the 
alternative to Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now Bush will have to engage us on the issues and the issues  
are our playing field,'' said Forbes strategist Greg Mueller. ``The 
wind of inevitability is out of the Bush sails.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I am the conservative alternative to challenge the  
status quo candidates,'' Forbes said. Like the third-place 
finisher, Elizabeth Dole, Forbes has never held elective office and 
faces the challenge of seeking the nation's highest office as his 
first. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole argued that her showing earned her top-tier standing and  
respect from the pundits, saying a brand-new pool of young and 
professional women is fueling her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an invisible army and that's another reason we won,''  
she said. ``It's the people the pollsters didn't survey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's far from clear that Dole can motivate that army in numbers  
that pose a threat to Bush, well beyond the 3,410 votes she drew in 
the straw poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative activist Gary Bauer finished fourth with his  
church-based network and seeks to coalesce social conservatives, 
although Forbes is courting the same group. The publisher brings 
along a personal fortune, and some pragmatists argue he can level 
the financial playing field with Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I've got staying power,'' Bauer contended. ``We expect  
to go all the way to the convention. 
</P>
<P>
	For the other Republican candidates, there was little good news  
in the straw polls results. Some acknowledged it openly, others did 
not. 
</P>
<P>
	``The No. 1 rule in politics is to peak on Election Day'' and  
not in a summertime straw poll, former Vice President Dan Quayle 
said on CNN. He said he ``absolutely'' will continue in the race 
despite his eighth-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander headed home to assess his  
options. Aides said today that he had decided to drop out of the 
race. Both he and Quayle faced serious fund-raising questions, and 
it would be hard to convince financial backers they have a 
realistic shot at the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been frequent suggestions that commentator Pat  
Buchanan could move to another party if his bid for the GOP 
nomination falters. His fifth-place showing, along with his 
reaction to it, did little to quell the rumbling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know exactly where I'm going to be in August of  
2000,'' when the nomination is awarded, Buchanan said. His fiery 
blend of conservative populism isn't a good fit with most of the 
alternative parties, and it's difficult to see him carving out a 
role within the GOP either. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona Sen. John McCain skipped the straw poll, and he has left  
little doubt he'll bypass Iowa's leadoff caucuses next February to 
focus on the New Hampshire primary. 
</P>
<P>
	``I may not want to be a part of that,'' said McCain, arguing  
he'd prefer to focus on more traditional election campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	He faces trouble, however, because he is left out of the  
political mix in the meantime, and candidates criss-crossing in 
Iowa get far more attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a meaningless kind of senseless thing,'' McCain said of  
the straw poll. 
</P>
<P>
	It also offered an early definition of the presidential  
campaign, and McCain wasn't included.

<HEADLINE> PlayStation, Nintendo 64 Cut Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Prices on both the Sony PlayStation and  
the competing Nintendo 64 will be cut to $99 as the gaming console 
companies prepared for the upcoming release of Sega's new Dreamcast 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is obviously a defensive move in an extremely competitive  
market,'' said Chris Byrne, a toy industry analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrne said that the new low prices announced Monday -- both  
dropping from $129 -- will allow consumers without a lot of extra 
entertainment money to go ahead and buy a console. He said that 
high-end buyers interested in the best systems will probably 
replace their existing systems with the $199 Dreamcast, a system 
reviewers say push the entertainment into new, exciting realms with 
enhanced graphics and sound. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the cuts are also going to help get consoles under  
more Christmas trees this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new pricing is certain to have a positive impact on unit  
sales during the upcoming holiday selling season,'' says David 
Leibowitz, managing director of Burnham Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony introduced PlayStation in 1995 at $299. Since then, Sony  
has sold more than 55 million units worldwide, landing in one out 
of every five U.S. households. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony's closest competition has been the Nintendo 64. Nintendo  
has sold almost 20 million of the units. 
</P>
<P>
	Sega Enterprises Ltd. -- which holds a distant third position in  
the market -- is preparing to launch Dreamcast on Sept. 9. So far, 
demand for the Dreamcast has been strong, with more than 200,000 
pre-orders. 
</P>
<P>
	Nintendo's executive vice president of sales and marketing Peter  
Main said the timing is right for his company to gain significant 
market share. 
</P>
<P>
	``Historically, whether on home systems like the 16-bit Super  
Nintendo Entertainment System or the handheld Game Boy, Nintendo's 
share of sales grows as the product cycle extends,'' Main said. 
``For every avid game player anxiously watching for a new hardware 
platform, there are five or more discriminating consumers just 
waiting for the existing library of top games to come within their 
financial reach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Kaz Hirai, president of Sony Computer Entertainment America,  
said the PlayStation will continue to dominate the market, with the 
lower price serving to broaden the company's audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Nintendo said the price cuts take effect immediately, while Sony  
said the cuts go into effect Aug. 23.

<HEADLINE> Burlington To Buy Poco Petroleums </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Burlington Resources has agreed to buy Canada's  
Poco Petroleums Ltd. for $1.75 billion in stock, making 
Houston-based Burlington the fourth-largest natural gas producer in 
North America. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement announced Monday, Poco shareholders will  
receive .25 Burlington share for each share of Poco held, or a 
one-for-four exchange. Based on Burlington Resources' closing stock 
price Monday of $45.31 1/4, the deal values each Poco share at $11.33. 
That represents a 25 premium over Poco's closing price Monday of 
$9.03 (13.40 Canadian dollars) before it was halted on the Toronto 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Burlington also will assume $750 million in Poco debt.  
</P>
<P>
	Poco's 300 employees will be retained and added to Burglington  
Resources' staff of 1,750, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal marks Burlington Resources' entry into the Canadian  
market and further strengthens its position as the dominant 
independent exploration and production company in the U.S. market, 
President Bobby S. Shackouls said. 
</P>
<P>
	``BR, with Poco as its partner in Canada, will be better  
positioned than at any time in its history to continue the 
implementation of our aggressive, global, value-oriented capital 
program,'' he said. ``In short, Poco is an ideal company to be BR's 
growth platform in Canada, and to build value for the shareholders 
of the combined enterprise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Ferguson, Poco's vice president and chief financial  
officer, said merger talks had been under way for about three 
months. He said the two companies are comparable in their 
aggressiveness and the youth of their staffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a very large producer of natural gas in Canada, and  
they're a very large producer of natural gas in the U.S., but they 
don't have anything in Canada so it's a good fit. The cultures are 
very similar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, which is expected to close by the end of the year, has  
been approved by directors of both companies but is subject to 
shareholder and regulatory approval. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company will rank behind only Exxon, BP Amoco and  
Royal Dutch/Shell in North American natural gas production. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies had a combined total of 9.9 trillion cubic  
feet in worldwide reserves as of Dec. 31. Combined 1998 worldwide 
gas production was 2.1 billion cubic feet per day; oil production 
was approximately 106,000 barrels per day.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks' Lee Out 3-5 Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The Arizona Diamondbacks placed first baseman  
Travis Lee on the 15-day disabled list Monday and acknowledged he 
will be out much longer than that. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee sprained his left ankle while fielding fly balls during  
batting practice before Sunday's game against Milwaukee. Lee said 
he's been told he'll be sidelined for at least 3-5 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it rains it pours,'' Lee said. ``After what's gone on the  
last couple of months, this is the icing on the cake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lee, considered a cornerstone of the franchise when he signed a  
$10 million signing bonus in 1996, had lost his starting job in 
recent weeks and was mired in a 2-for-43 slump. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Buck Showalter had been starting either Erubiel Durazo,  
the hot-hitting youngster just called up from Triple-A Tucson, or 
Greg Colbrunn at first, with Lee coming in as a defensive 
specialist in the late innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee was hitting .236 with nine home runs and 50 RBIs, and there  
was talk that he would be sent to Triple-A Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks were considering using him some in the  
outfield, and he was working on judging fly balls off the bat when 
he turned his ankle on the outfield grass and fell to the ground in 
pain. He had to be taken off the field in a medical cart. 
</P>
<P>
	There was ligament damage to the ankle, and Lee left the  
ballpark on crutches. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you tell me he'll be back in three weeks, I'd be fine with  
that,'' Showalter said. ``It has the potential to be longer than 
that. When ligaments are involved, you're dealing with a lot of 
unknown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To replace Lee on the roster, the Diamondbacks called up  
outfielder Rob Ryan from Triple-A Tucson. Ryan, like Lee, is a 
left-handed batter. He was hitting .290 with the Sidewinders with 
30 doubles, 19 home runs and a team-high 88 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's always mention as being as a lot like (David) Dellucci,''  
Showalter said. ``We hope so, because that's a heck of a 
compliment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan, 26, is one of the first players to work his way up through  
Arizona's farm system. A 26th-round selection in the 1996 free 
agent draft, Ryan started at Lethbridge in 1996, moved up to South 
Bend in 1997 and spent the last two seasons with Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's exciting, and to come up here and by right in a pennant  
race, that's really something,'' Ryan said.

<HEADLINE> Mexicans' Families To Be Paid $30M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Insurers for an American clothing company have  
agreed to pay $30 million to the families of Mexican workers killed 
and injured when a bus taking them to a factory in Mexico crashed. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen people died and 12 were injured in June 1997 when the  
bus went off a rain-slicked road, crashed and caught fire before 
rolling into a sewage ditch near the Mexican town of Valle Hermosa, 
about one hour south of Brownsville, Texas. Lawyers for the workers 
charged the bus was unsafe, that officials ignored warnings about 
faulty brakes, and that the driver was untrained. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawsuit filed by the workers and their families against New  
York-based Salant Corp. went to a jury trial in state district 
court in the border town of Eagle Pass. After two weeks of 
testimony from 11 witnesses, including a survivor, the lawsuit was 
settled before the company began its defense. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement was disclosed Monday in a Salant filing with the  
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Caddell, lead lawyer for all but one of the plaintiffs,  
said the amount of the settlement should convince foreign companies 
they won't be protected from Mexico's ``lax'' enforcement of 
worker-safety laws. 
</P>
<P>
	But a trade group questioned the ruling's legitimacy and said it  
would be detrimental to the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``If frivolous lawsuits get going because of this, it could be  
devastating,'' said Dennis Charlton, an official with the 
Maquiladora Association in Mexico and owner of a rainwear factory 
in Piedras Negras, Mexico. ``The big question is, what's the 
legality of having a jury in Eagle Pass decide about something that 
happened in Mexico?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salant and a Mexican trade official protested hearing the case  
in Texas, but an appeals court in San Antonio and the Texas Supreme 
Court allowed it to go ahead because the subsidiary and its 
officers were based in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Caddell said it was crucial that the case be heard in U.S.  
courts. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Mexico, you get no jury, and I frankly don't think a judge  
in Mexico would've made the same award as a jury in Eagle Pass,'' 
he said. ``Mexico is so eager to attract foreign investment that 
it's willing to look the other way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In its filing with the SEC, Salant denied liability. It is  
expected that Salant's insurance companies, Chubb, Cigna and 
Hartford, will pay the entire $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer has been appointed to decide how the settlement will be  
divided among families of the dead and the survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	Salant's lawyers declined to discuss the company's view of the  
case. 
</P>
<P>
	``The insurers offered to settle, and it was settled,'' said  
Howard Close, a Beaumont lawyer who represented Salant. 
</P>
<P>
	Salant, which had 1998 sales of $300 million, makes several  
lines of Perry Ellis menswear. The factory where the dead and 
injured workers were employed was operated by a subsidiary, Texas 
Apparel Co., and made jeans for Wal-Mart, Sears and Kmart. Salant 
sold the factory and other clothing lines earlier this year in an 
unrelated post-bankruptcy restructuring.

<HEADLINE> IMF Orders Bank Scandal Prosecution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *BY HARRY DUNPHY   	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund today demanded  
that Indonesia quickly and publicly investigate a banking scandal 
and prosecute any wrongdoers. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF spokesman Vasuki Shastry said Stanley Fischer, the IMF's  
deputy managing director, telephoned Indonesian President B.J. 
Habibie over the weekend to make the lending agency's position 
clear. 
</P>
<P>
	An audit of Bank Bali, a recently nationalized institution,  
showed it paid around $80 million as a commission to a finance 
company controlled by an official of Habibie's ruling Golkar party. 
</P>
<P>
	Shastry said the IMF has followed the banking scandal ``with  
increasing concern and staff have been in intensive contact'' with 
Indonesian officials, culminating with Fischer's call. 
</P>
<P>
	He said IMF officials have emphasized that a satisfactory  
resolution of the case ``requires a thorough and independent 
investigation to be completed as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``The results should be made public,'' he said and ``legal  
action should be instituted in case the law was violated and steps 
should be taken to ensure that such practices cease.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shastry said Habibie assured the IMF that a full investigation  
is under way. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday the IMF expressed alarm over the scandal and warned it  
could lead to a loss of investor confidence at home and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank Bali scandal and another one have contributed to a  
plunge in the value of the rupiah, the country's currency, just as 
the battered economy was showing signs of recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF said it supported the appointment by Indonesia's bank  
restructuring organization of an independent auditor, 
PriceWaterhouseCoopers, to validate the agency's findings in the 
Bank Bali case. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second time in recent months that an international  
accounting firm has been asked to investigate irregularities in 
countries that have IMF loan programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month the IMF published a report by  
PriceWaterhouseCoopers into the Russian central bank's transfer of 
foreign exchange reserves to an offshore account in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF provided Indonesia and Russia with multibillion-dollar  
rescue programs when their economies collapsed in 1997 and last 
year and is still making installment payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia obtained a $4.5 billion loan from the IMF in early August  
and Indonesia received $460 million. Additional IMF loans to both 
governments are due to be made later this year.

<HEADLINE> Straw Poll Runs as Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The expected winner won. The expected casualty  
quit the campaign. The rest of the field of Republican presidential 
candidates, just as predictably, claimed satisfaction, or at least 
survival. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iowa straw poll ran to form, a forgettable, expensive  
episode in the campaign for the 2000 GOP presidential nomination. 
These straws pointed no change in the winds. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George W. Bush won as he'd said he would. Lamar  
Alexander, who already was struggling for lack of funds, ran sixth 
and dropped out of the race Monday. Steve Forbes outspent 
everybody, came in second, 10 points behind Bush, and said that 
showed he'd be the real challenger to the front-runner. Elizabeth 
Dole finished third and called it a strong victory. Conservatives 
Gary Bauer and Pat Buchanan were next among nine entries. 
</P>
<P>
	It probably was the last straw for this Republican campaign. For  
the leading candidate, just-for-show votes like the one Saturday 
night in Ames, Iowa, can only be traps. Win, and the political 
world yawns, while rivals say the margin was not impressive, as 
they are saying now of Bush's 30 percent. Lose, or be tied, as Bob 
Dole was in 1995, and it is read as evidence of weakness. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida Republicans have staged straw polls in prior campaigns,  
but not this time. Gov. Jeb Bush quietly squelched that. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrating his Iowa victory, George Bush told his supporters:  
</P>
<P>
	``Some pundits said I had nothing to gain and potentially a lot  
to lose. Well, thanks to you, we gained a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But what he gained was far less than what he staked when he  
entered the straw poll campaign two months ago and said he'd win. 
Anything else would have been an embarrassing setback for the man 
in command of the public opinion poll rankings and the competition 
for Republican campaign cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush probably did gain with Alexander's exit, since allies of  
the former Tennessee governor may well sign on with the 
front-runner now. But the one rival who skipped the straw poll, 
Sen. John McCain of Arizona -- he called it a sham -- gained in the 
fallout. After former Vice President Dan Quayle's forlorn eighth 
place in the straw poll, four leaders of his campaign in South 
Carolina defected to McCain, who is concentrating on the 
presidential primaries there and in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle said he will absolutely keep running, but his campaign  
already has had fund-raising trouble, and the Iowa showing could 
make it worse. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander had cut his campaign staff to save money for his  
all-or-nothing quest for a straw poll showing that might have 
persuaded donors to help him. No go, but the straw poll only 
accelerated the inevitable end of a campaign that had to compete 
with Bush for centrist GOP donors. 
</P>
<P>
	At his farewell in Nashville, Tenn., after campaigning almost  
nonstop for six years, Alexander said that while there is ``a 
powerful force'' for a Bush nomination, he won't join it with an 
endorsement now because there should be competition in next year's 
primary elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be better off if the contest runs,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Forbes has the personal fortune to make sure of that, as he did  
with his attack ad campaigns against Bob Dole and Alexander in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes got 20 percent of the straw poll vote, after a campaign  
that cost at least $1.4 million, closer to $2 million according to 
his rivals. The Bush campaign spent more than $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush and Forbes were the only two who could afford it, because  
they aren't bound by state spending limits that apply to candidates 
who accept federal funds for their campaigns. Forbes with his own 
money, Bush with the $40 million plus he has raised from GOP 
donors. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can buy a straw poll,'' Quayle said, who got 4 percent.  
``You can't buy an election.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it takes money to run. Bush's challengers did not come away  
from the straw poll with evidence to sway donors their way. With 
his long lead in the public opinion polls and his command in fund 
raising, Bush has what he needed: Nothing unexpected, a field 
narrowed by one but with no major changes in the ranking of the 
leading candidates, and a win to add to his front-runner's resume.

<HEADLINE> Colts' James Gets Ready for Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TERRE HAUTE, Ind. (AP) -- First-round draft pick Edgerrin James  
had his first extensive training camp practice Monday since ending 
his three-week holdout with the Indianapolis Colts. 
</P>
<P>
	The fourth overall draft pick gave himself a passing grade.  
</P>
<P>
	``I felt pretty good,'' said James, designated the team's  
starting tailback when he was drafted in April, joined the team in 
camp after signing a seven-year, $49 million contract Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'm a little further ahead than people expected. A lot  
of time when I was holding out, I was doing a lot of working out. 
Also, I was studying my plays, so I'm making very few mistakes,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The need to get James ready for Saturday's exhibition game at  
New Orleans became more crucial when Darick Holmes became the first 
member of the team to suffer a major injury. Holmes, the starter at 
tailback in place of James in the first two exhibition games, 
suffered a broken fibula near his right ankle as the Colts defeated 
Cincinnati 20-17. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jim Mora said that Holmes, who watched practice on a golf  
cart and is walking with crutches, would be out for about six 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes was injured on the Colts' first possession of the second  
quarter after catching a swing pass from Peyton Manning. He was 
originally tackled by Bengals cornerback Artrell Hawkins and then 
was hit by linebacker Oliver Gibson when he attempted to get back 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was definitely the second hit that produced the injury,''  
Holmes said Monday. ``He said he didn't hear a whistle, so I don't 
know if it was a late hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James, surprisingly drafted ahead of Heisman Trophy winner Ricky  
Williams, denied feeling any added pressure about playing his first 
NFL game this week against Williams and the Saints. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ricky is on offense. I'm on offense, so I really don't look at  
it as my first game being against Ricky Williams. The first game is 
against the New Orleans defense,'' said James who hopes to boost a 
running game that has netted only 86 yards on 36 carries by running 
backs in two games. 
</P>
<P>
	It's too early to judge the running game, James said.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have to come together as a team,'' he said. ``In the  
preseason, you have to get everything correct and we have enough 
time leading up to the first game. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the preseason, you're going to try different things and  
different looks. To the fans, it looks like we aren't doing 
anything, but we're just trying things out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest disappointment to me so far has been our running  
game,'' Mora said. ``I think we'll do a better job as we get 
going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mora said it was too early to decide how much James will play  
against the Saints. However, he doesn't plan to rush James because 
of the injury to Holmes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll stick with what we would have done. We're not going to  
push him, or rush him. We've got two games and we've got three 
weeks,'' Mora said in reference to the opening game of the regular 
season against Buffalo on Sept. 12. ``He'll be ready. He's a pretty 
sharp guy, he'll study hard. He went out there today. He didn't 
make a lot of mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``He seemed comfortable.''  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Colts cut their roster by waiving linebacker  
Antony Jordan, quarterback Jim Kubiak and tight end Joe Kuyendall. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other players didn't practice Monday. Defensive back Paul  
Miranda, who sprained a ligament in his right knee Saturday, is 
expected to be out for 3-to-4 weeks. Defensive back Craig Miller 
was excused to attend the funeral of a relative.

<HEADLINE> Farmers: Crop Insurance Doesn't Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Bob Puskas' 300 acres of corn outside Somerset, N.J. is stunted,  
sickly and just 2 feet high, a withered victim of the Northeast's 
historic drought. 
</P>
<P>
	Puskas has farmer's insurance, but his pocketbook stands to take  
a beating, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, adjusters told him the crop was a complete loss, but  
also said he'll be lucky to get back $10,000 of the $75,000 he 
spent to raise it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Insurance doesn't pay,'' Puskas said. ``Really, it's next to  
nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While uninsured farms will account for most of the hundreds of  
millions of dollars lost due to the drought, critics say people 
like Puskas who participate in the federally subsidized crop 
insurance program aren't provided much of a safety net. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers say the premiums are too expensive, the paperwork too  
complicated, and the payments too paltry. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Congress scaled back production-based crop subsidies in  
1996, the Department of Agriculture has encouraged farmers to buy 
insurance by covering a wider variety of crops and offering a 30 
percent discount on premiums. 
</P>
<P>
	But the majority of growers in the Northeast still go without,  
unlike farmers in the bigger agricultural states across the 
Midwest. In Pennsylvania and New York, just 23 percent of the corn 
and soybean acres are insured. In New Jersey, 31 percent of corn 
and 43 percent of soybeans are covered. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, 99 percent of the cotton in Texas and 94 percent  
of the wheat in North Dakota was insured last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Northeast farmers say they buy insurance only to qualify  
for bank loans or USDA programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Catastrophic insurance, like Puskas' policy, is actually pretty  
cheap, a lump sum of $60 per crop. But a farmer must spend several 
hundred dollars more for a policy that would recoup planting costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``What are you going to spend that extra money on? Crop  
insurance or fertilizer?'' asked Tom Shockley, executive director 
of the Maryland Farm Service Agency. ``Farmers honestly believe 
that the crop insurance in existence at this point does them no 
good. They've got to have a total disaster to get anything back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some farmers complain of being asked to take out separate  
policies on each crop, or separate policies on the same crop 
planted on different rental properties. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Beam, who expects to recoup barely 40 percent of the  
$250,000 he spent planting 1,000 acres of corn in Chester County, 
Pa., got fed up when he tried to get insurance this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got an agent from across the state who sent me a form I  
didn't quite understand and it kinda slipped by me,'' Beam said. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey's corn crop is projected to yield just 40 bushels per  
acre, down 57 percent from last year's 92 bushels. Soybean yields 
are projected to be down 25 percent. Losses could reach $80 
million, according to the state. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pennsylvania, corn and soybean yields could be down 36  
percent from 1998. The governor's office estimates that losses may 
reach $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have guys that are on the verge right now, it's gonna  
put 'em under,'' said Jim Etsch, a farmer in Monroe Township, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	But is it enough to send them shopping for insurance?  
</P>
<P>
	``Next year, I may evaluate it a little closer,'' said Stan  
Guest, an uninsured farmer in East Nantmeal Township, Pa. ``But you 
know, we may not have another year like this one for 50 years.''

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays' Canseco May Return Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- A little more than a month since back surgery,  
Jose Canseco thinks he's ready to come back to the Tampa Bay Devil 
Rays. 
</P>
<P>
	After batting and running Monday during a simulated game in St.  
Petersburg, Fla., Canseco hopes to return Friday when the Devil 
Rays open a homestand against Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today was the first day I actually did some running,'' Canseco  
said. ``My legs feel a little wobbly out there because I haven't 
done that kind of running in probably about a month and a half. But 
the main concern is seeing how the back holds up under hitting 
situations, and I hit the ball extremely well. I took a couple of 
aggressive hacks and hit some balls out of the ballpark, so 
hopefully I'll be ready to go Friday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco had surgery July 11 for a ruptured disc in his back. It  
was originally feared he'd be out for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I was extremely luck that I went into the operation  
already in pretty good shape, so I think that definitely helped in 
shortening the recuperation time,'' Canseco said. ``I felt great 
the next day; as soon as I woke up, the pain was gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He first started hitting against a pitching machine two weeks  
ago and last week took batting practice with Devil Rays manager 
Larry Rothschild pitching. 
</P>
<P>
	``You really don't know how it's going to hold up under such  
torque as the way I swing the bat,'' he said. ``Right away the pain 
was gone, so I knew that this was a success there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco was hitting .276 with 31 homers and 69 RBIs before the  
operation. He was elected to the AL All-Star team as the designated 
hitter but could not participate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The back is there, the strength is there,'' he said. ``The  
only way I'll start getting the timing back is in actual game 
situations. The legs will come. I started running today and will 
run up until Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco, a ``Bash Brother'' along with Mark McGwire during their  
days with the Oakland Athletics, hit his 400th career homer earlier 
this season is 24th on the career list with 428.

<HEADLINE> Court Throws Out AOL Case vs. AT&AMP;T </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal judge tossed out America Online Inc.'s  
case against AT&AMP;T Corp. over the ``You have mail'' slogan, ruling 
that AOL doesn't have exclusive rights to the popular expression. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge also refused to block AT&AMP;T from using ``buddy list''  
and the abbreviation ``IM'' with its free instant messaging 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	The dismissal on Friday by U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton of  
Alexandria, Va., was the latest setback to AOL's attempt to control 
the spread of phrases it coins for its own Internet service. 
</P>
<P>
	When AOL subscribers get electronic mail, a computer voice  
announces ``You've got mail'' and the message ``You have mail'' 
appears on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL sued after AT&AMP;T started using ``You have mail'' last  
December on its WorldNet e-mail service. But the term already had 
expanded into popular culture with the release of last year's movie 
``You've Got Mail,'' starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan as e-mail pen 
pals. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T maintained that it is a commonly used English phrase. The  
court agreed on that phrase as well as on the terms ``buddy list,'' 
which is a catalog of a computer user's frequent electronic pen 
pals, and IM, shorthand for the instant messaging service. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL said an appeal was planned.  
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that the court's decision incorrectly interprets  
well-established foundations of trademark law,'' AOL's general 
counsel, Paul Cappuccio, said in a statement. ``We are confident 
that the ruling will be reversed.''

<HEADLINE> Utah's Delta Center Almost Repaired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The Delta Center will be the available  
this weekend for a benefit concert and, the next night, for the 
regular season finale for the WNBA's Utah Starzz. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Miller, owner of the 8-year-old arena and the NBA's Utah  
Jazz, said Monday that repairs are progressing faster than expected 
in the wake of a tornado that struck last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Complete repairs are expected to take about six weeks.  
</P>
<P>
	Friday's concert, by country singer Neil McCoy, will benefit  
charities designated by Jazz forward Karl Malone. The Starzz's 
final game, against Los Angeles, is scheduled for Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Delta Center sustained broken windows and holes in the roof,  
as well as water damage to the basketball floor and several suites. 
Damage was estimated at $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Starzz moved a home game last week to Ogden, 33 miles to the  
north.

<HEADLINE>  East Timor Vote On Despite Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- The United Nations will go ahead with the  
upcoming vote on East Timor's future despite continued threats 
against civilians and U.N. staff, a U.N. envoy said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamsheed Marker, the United Nations' top envoy for the  
half-island territory, did not specify who had made the threats. In 
the past, however, officials of the U.N. Assistance Mission in East 
Timor have accused anti-independence militiamen of similar acts. 
</P>
<P>
	``UNAMET is not going to be put off course one degree by  
elements, rogue elements or ... hoodlums. We have a job to do and 
we will do it,'' Marker said of the vote slated for Aug. 30 that 
will allow East Timorese to decide whether to stay part of 
Indonesia as an autonomous region or to become fully independent. 
</P>
<P>
	Marker said he had informed Indonesian security forces about the  
threats, including a report that one armed group planned to attack 
U.N. staff on polling day. He had also heard of other threats 
against thousands of displaced villagers who have fled their homes 
to escape earlier attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Marker's remarks come only a week after rival East Timorese  
factions signed a code of conduct that bans violence and threats 
during the campaign period, which started peacefully last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech to parliament today, President B.J. Habibie vowed to  
respect the outcome of the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	While Habibie said he was confident that the rest of Indonesia  
would remain united, even if East Timorese chooses to secede, he 
floated a warning just in case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Political actions that are against the constitution -- for  
example breaking away from the republic of Indonesia -- we cannot 
tolerate at all,'' he said. ``Democracy and freedom must follow the 
constitution, law, ethics and morality that were laid down by the 
founders of the Indonesian republic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The upcoming election has sparked secessionist demands from  
other provinces, such as oil-rich Aceh in the far west of Sumatra 
island and Irian Jaya on New Guinea. Rebels are fighting Indonesian 
troops in both regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia occupied the former Portuguese colony in 1975 and East  
Timor has been wracked by guerrilla warfare and human rights abuses 
since then. 
</P>
<P>
	The prospect of an independent East Timor has polarized the  
region's 800,000 people. Anti-independence militias, allegedly 
formed with the support of Indonesia's military, are blamed for a 
wave of violence in recent months. Dozens of civilians have been 
killed and tens of thousands displaced. 
</P>
<P>
	Independence activists say the majority of East Timorese want to  
break away. They accuse the militias of waging a terror campaign to 
stymie the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the pro-Indonesian militias handed over 97 guns today, in  
keeping with an accord by all armed groups to disarm ahead of the 
ballot. 
</P>

ceremony in the village of Atabae, 100 miles southwest of Dili.

<HEADLINE> Detroit Lions Sign Steve Morrison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNIVERSITY CENTER, Mich. (AP) -- The Detroit Lions on Monday  
signed free agent linebacker Steve Morrison to replace Matt 
Russell, who suffered a season-ending knee injury in Friday's 
exhibition opener at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``Morrison gives us immediate help,'' Lions coach Bobby Ross  
said. ``He's actually a little bit bigger than I thought he was. 
We're very fortunate to have someone of that caliber.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morrison, 6-foot-3 and 246 pounds, was a standout at Brother  
Rice High School and Michigan and played his first four seasons 
with the Indianapolis Colts, seeing action in 58 games. He has 
started 29 games in his pro career, including 12 last season, when 
he had 65 tackles and one sack. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting called up by the Lions was ``a dream come true,''  
Morrison said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I take a lot of pride in the fact that people said I couldn't  
do it, but I'm still around,'' he said after Monday afternoon's 
practice at Saginaw Valley State University, his first workout with 
his new team. 
</P>
<P>
	Morrison was a three-year starter at Michigan, where he had 333  
tackles and six interceptions in his career. As a senior in 1994, 
he led the Wolverines with 122 tackles and was a semifinalist for 
the Butkus Award, given to the best linebacker in college football.

<HEADLINE> Peanut Farmers Approve Assessment / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, Ga. (AP) -- The nation's peanut farmers have agreed to  
assess themselves a fee to raise $10 million annually for 
researching and promoting their product. 
</P>
<P>
	The fee amounts to 1 percent of the money each farmer collects  
for his peanuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's basically going to mean we're going to have the money to  
get the message out about the health and nutritional benefits of 
peanuts,'' said Darvin Eason, a peanut farmer in Lenox and 
president of the 3,300-member Georgia Peanut Producers Association, 
which pushed for the program. 
</P>
<P>
	``The shelling industry and the manufacturers see that we're  
serious about promoting our own product,'' he added. ``I believe 
you're going to see a lot of the industry coming together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Department of Agriculture mailed 23,080 ballots to  
eligible growers in May for a referendum on the program. Of the 
5,415 ballots returned, nearly 67 percent supported it. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal establishes a checkoff program similar to existing  
ones for everything from beef to popcorn to watermelons, in which 
farmers pay to help promote their products. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the money also will pay for research on ways to reduce  
growers' production costs and develop new products. 
</P>
<P>
	A new National Peanut Board will administer the program under  
the Agriculture Department's direction. 
</P>
<P>
	Peanut growers will submit a list of nominees to Agriculture  
Secretary Dan Glickman, who will appoint the 10-member board. Each 
of the nine big peanut states -- Georgia, Texas, Alabama, Florida, 
South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, New Mexico and Oklahoma -- 
will have one board member, with the 10th representing other 
peanut-producing states.

	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The skies look grim to Arkansas farmers  
as they reach a pivotal point in the growing season. 
</P>
<P>
	The state has had lower than average rainfall this year and  
crops are withering in the 100-degree heat. Farmers say they need 
rain in the next 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Only half of the 3.5 million soybean acres in seven northern  
Arkansas counties are in irrigated fields, according to Richard 
Klerk, a Cooperative Extension Service agronomist for that area. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fields are at a critical stage,'' he said. ``Without any  
water, they could lose 50 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One Lonoke County soybean farmer said he's already lost.  
</P>
<P>
	``The last week or 10 days has really taken its toll. Right now,  
I've lost about 10 percent,'' said Bob Bevis of Scott, who owns 
5,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't get a rain pretty quick then the beans that don't  
die are just going to be little-bitty-shriveled-up and not worth 
anything,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Klerk works with farmers to help manage their crops according to  
University of Arkansas recommendations. He also works with wheat 
farmers, whose planting and harvesting cycles have escaped the July 
and August heat and drought. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a good crop in June and won't plant again until October  
or November,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Skip Debate on Yom Kippur </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Despite protests by the United States and  
Israel, the annual debate at the U.N. General Assembly this year 
will start on Yom Kippur, the holiest day for Jews -- but without 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The president, as leader of the host country, traditionally  
speaks on the first day of the two-week general debate, which 
brings leaders from around the world to New York. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton is skipping the Sept. 20 opening session ``out of  
respect for the Jewish residents of the New York area,'' and will 
instead deliver his address on Sept. 21, said deputy U.S. 
ambassador Peter Burleigh. 
</P>
<P>
	While United Nations is closed on two Christian holidays,  
Christmas and Good Friday, and two Muslim holidays, Eid al-Adha and 
Eid al-Fitr, it has never acknowledged the holiest day for Jews. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Secretary-General Kofi Annan earlier this month,  
the head of the American Jewish Congress urged a postponement of 
the start of the General Assembly until Sept. 21. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the attitude so often demonstrated by the U.N. towards  
Israel, it is perhaps not surprising that Yom Kippur is ignored,'' 
wrote congress executive director Phil Baum. ``We are asking only 
for basic fairness -- that the same treatment and recognition 
accorded to Christianity and Islam be extended to Judaism as 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baum noted that Yom Kippur, the day of atonement, is observed by  
Jews around the world -- from Australia, Japan and Russia, to 
Britain, South Africa, and Mexico, in addition to Israel and the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	In his reply made public Monday, Annan said the date had been  
decided by the 185 member states of the General Assembly -- and that 
only the General Assembly could reconsider the date. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me express my sincere regret for the discomfort that the  
decision of the General Assembly may have caused you and members of 
the Jewish faith around the world,'' the secretary-general said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to assure you of my commitment to promoting warm  
and harmonious relations between the United Nations and the Jewish 
community,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Democratic congressmen, Benjamin Gilman of New York and Sam  
Gejdenson of Connecticut, also sent a letter to Annan several 
months ago protesting at the Sept. 20 starting date. 
</P>
<P>
	At meetings earlier this year Burleigh said he had pushed not to  
have the session start on Yom Kippur. But he said Sept. 20 ended up 
having almost ``universal agreement.''

<HEADLINE> S. Korean IOC Member's Son To Sue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The son of a powerful International  
Olympic Committee member from South Korea said Monday he plans to 
sue a Utah businessman for ``false testimony'' to federal 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	John Kim denied that David Simmons, former director of a Salt  
Lake communications firm, set up a sham job to help Kim obtain 
legal residency in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim said in a statement issued through a family spokesman in New  
York that he returned his green card to the U.S. embassy in Seoul 
on Aug. 6, ``thereby voluntarily abandoning its privileges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I took this action in response to speculation regarding my  
motives, past and present, for permanent resident status in the 
U.S.,'' Kim said. ``What was legitimate from the outset suddenly 
became `fraudulent' because of David Simmons' false testimony.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons pleaded guilty in federal court Aug. 3 to misdemeanor  
tax evasion. It was the first criminal case stemming from 
investigations of vote-buying to help Salt Lake City win the 2002 
Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	His testimony was seen as an initial step as investigators build  
a case against higher-ranking Olympic officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim said federal investigators made ``what many might consider  
an offer that I can't refuse,'' but he rejected it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although I am willing to cooperate with the Justice  
Department, I shall not yield to intimidation despite assurances 
that I can get a `slap on the wrist' in exchange for testimony 
against their target,'' Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
	James Holbrook, Simmons' attorney in Salt Lake City, said late  
Monday neither he nor his client has been served with papers from 
Kim and denied Kim's allegation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Simmons has provided truthful information to the  
Department of Justice and will continue to do so,'' Holbrook said. 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons told investigators he hired John Kim, the son of IOC  
vice president Kim Un-yong, one of the most influential IOC 
members, at the request of the Salt Lake bid committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Simmons claimed as a business expense the money funneled  
to him to pay the younger Kim's salary at Keystone Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons said he used fake contracts and phony invoices to  
conceal the fact that John Kim's salary was being paid by the Salt 
Lake City Olympic Bid Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``If that is true, why then did he commit major resources, time  
and money, for several business trips in the company of associates 
to Korea, based on our business relationship?'' Kim asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim said he knew nothing of the salary arrangement between SLOC  
and Keystone. Kim also said he rejected SLOC payments, including 
one for $10,000, and turned down an SLOC offer for consulting work.

<HEADLINE>  Students Return to Columbine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- When the nightmares persisted, English  
teacher Paula Reed didn't think she would ever return to Columbine 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Reed and hundreds of other teachers and students put aside  
their fears Monday and reclaimed Columbine from those who wanted it 
demolished in the wake of the worst school shooting in U.S. 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to come back. I knew I had to,'' Ms. Reed said  
as she tearfully remembered two members of the debate team killed 
in the shooting. ``For me to abandon them, wasn't an option.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Sheehan, student body president, said some students were  
upset about returning to school but almost everyone made it through 
the day without problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Old memories came back,'' he said. ``Most kids were really  
happy to get back in school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first day students have returned for classes since  
April 20, when students Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, heavily 
armed with explosives and guns, opened fire. They killed 12 
classmates and a teacher and wounded 23 people before committing 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	As the nation watched on live TV, terrified students scurried  
out of the school, hands held high over their heads. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the same watchful eyes Monday, the students were mostly  
upbeat as they returned to class, striving for a normal day under 
abnormal circumstances. They were met with a huge rally, led by 
Principal Frank DeAngelis. 
</P>
<P>
	In classrooms, teachers reminded students that counseling is  
available, and about 25 students stopped by the so-called safe room 
to talk. Two mental health experts have been added to the staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's mixed feelings. Some people are very happy to be back;  
others can't handle being here,'' senior Kim Blair said during her 
lunch break. ``It's somewhat typical, but somewhat really 
strange.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jefferson County School District spent $1.2 million to  
transform the inside of Columbine from a scene of unspeakable 
carnage back into a place of learning. A new wall of lockers blocks 
the entrance to the second-floor library, where Klebold and Harris 
killed 10 students and shot themselves to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Security has also been tightened. Along with armed guards, 16  
more surveillance cameras were added inside the school, and all 
students and staff must wear ID badges. However, the students will 
not have to pass through metal detectors or submit to backpack 
checks. 
</P>
<P>
	Some students chaffed at the new restrictions, especially a  
``zero-tolerance'' policy against the kind of harassment Klebold, 
17, and Harris, 18, claimed they suffered. The two were misfits who 
did not believe they fit into the typical high school cliques. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not so bad being back, except all this whining and  
zero-tolerance stuff,'' said Trevor Pousson, 17. 
</P>
<P>
	At the rally before school started, DeAngelis implored his  
students to be more respectful of those who might seem different. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that the compassion and the unity that you had at the  
end of last year will continue and will be built upon to give us 
the strength to move forward,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who returned Monday was student Lance Kirklin. The  
16-year-old survived five gunshot wounds, including a shotgun blast 
that tore away much of the left side of his face. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of his classmates and at least two employees chose not to  
come back, but about 97 percent of the 2,000 students enrolled at 
Columbine attended class Monday, 1 percentage point better than 
average. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the 23 wounded students, Richard Castaldo, remained  
hospitalized Monday, undergoing rehabilitation for a spinal injury. 
</P>
<P>
	At least six parents of students who were killed in the rampage  
attended the rally and later expressed anger that there was no 
moment of silence for those who died. 
</P>
<P>
	``They completely left out the victims, those who lost their  
lives, those who will never be the same,'' said Brian Rohrbough, 
whose 15-year-old son, Daniel, was shot while holding an exit door 
for fleeing students. ``They put it under a carpet, like it's a 
little fire and they put it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, school district spokeswoman Barbara Monseu said the  
intention was not to forget but to find a way to move forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``In terms of recognizing the students who are not with us  
today, for us, even though they weren't mentioned, they certainly 
are in our hearts,'' she said. ``They are students that we will 
never forget.''

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Pushes Foreign Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The price for shortchanging diplomatic  
work abroad would be paid in ``life and treasure,'' President 
Clinton warned Monday in a speech to the centennial convention of 
the Veterans of Foreign Wars. 
</P>
<P>
	Pushing for full financing by Congress of his foreign affairs  
budget, the president said proposed cuts would undermine U.S. 
efforts to control nuclear proliferation, forge peace in the Middle 
East, try to stop conflicts in Africa and lead in the United 
Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are cutting the very programs designed to keep our soldiers  
out of war in the first place,'' Clinton said. ``Underfunding our 
arsenal of peace is just as risky as underfunding our arsenal of 
war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign affairs operations account for about 1 percent of the  
federal budget. The House has approved $12.7 billion for fiscal 
2000, about $2 billion less than Clinton requested. Clinton said 
that would place a greater burden on the military. 
</P>
<P>
	In his State of the Union address, Clinton advocated increasing  
cooperation with the countries of the former Soviet Union to 
prevent nuclear weapons stockpiles from falling into the wrong 
hands. Congress is considering spending $250 million less than 
Clinton would on containment in former Soviet countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has yet to provide funding that Clinton promised Israel  
and the Palestinians under the Wye River peace negotiations. 
Clinton is optimistic that new Israeli President Ehud Barak will be 
able to seal a deal with PLO chief Yasser Arafat, but he cautioned: 
``If there's a full-scale war in the Middle East, it will affect 
our interests and our values.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He again demanded that Congress fully pay U.S. arrears to the  
United Nations, which he described as a ``legal and moral 
obligation.'' Clinton said supporting the United Nations is crucial 
to maintaining peace in hot spots around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Problems we might have been able to resolve peacefully will  
turn into crises that we can only resolve at a cost of life and 
treasure,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time a president spoke to a VFW convention  
since 1990, when George Bush, a former combat pilot, spoke to the 
delegates during the buildup of the Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
	A small number of veterans tried to organize a boycott of  
Clinton's speech to protest his policies and his lack of military 
experience. But the hall was full, and Clinton's address was 
punctuated by frequent applause. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the last 100 years, America's men and women have  
sacrificed whatever was necessary, not for territorial gain, not 
for domination of others, but to secure the rights and freedom of 
others so Americans might have their freedom secured,'' Clinton 
said. ``You have made our nation proud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Major agenda topics at this year's VFW convention include  
long-term care for veterans and a requested increase in the budget 
of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Advocates say both are 
needed due to the rapidly growing number of aging veterans from the 
World War II and Korean War eras. 
</P>
<P>
	The VFW is seeking a congressional sponsor for a new GI Bill for  
current service members and is pushing for larger defense budgets 
and an increase in military readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization has about 2 million members and is the second  
largest veterans' organization after the American Legion. About 
30,000 people attended the convention.

<HEADLINE> Eritrean Leader:Peace Prospects Good </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prospects for an end to the bloody border  
conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea appear better than at any 
time in the past 15 months, Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki 
suggested Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Afwerki, here on an unofficial visit, cautioned that  
Ethiopia has yet to agree to a proposed regional peace plan and 
``the war is still not behind our backs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The road to peace is going to be difficult and full of  
complications,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The two Horn of Africa nations have been at war since May 1998  
over contested areas of their 620-mile border. Tens of thousands of 
soldiers and hundreds of civilians have died in the war and nearly 
half a million residents on both sides of the border have been 
driven from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This war is a senseless war,'' Afwerki told a National Press  
Club news conference. He called it ``the most devastating war in 
the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Eritrean government earlier this month accepted the  
Organization of African Unity's plan for ending the war. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Eritrea and Ethiopia previously accepted a framework peace  
plan drafted last year, as well as an update drafted in July. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Ethiopia has not yet agreed to the third and final  
document. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethiopian officials said they were seeking clarifications from  
Algerian President Abdulaziz Bouteflika, the current chairman of 
the Organization of African Unity. The OAU has been mediating an 
end to the war along with the United Nations and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ethiopia has yet to accept the package, saying it is seeking  
clarifications, although the carefully worked out OAU plan is 
extremely detailed and very clear,'' said Afwerki. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his visit to the United States was not an official one  
and he did not plan any meetings with U.S. officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Afwerki said Eritrea wants Ethiopia to compensate those whose  
property was seized, but would not insist on that as a precondition 
for peace. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are 60,000 people expelled illegally and their property  
seized,'' he said. He put the price tag at $800 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Eritrea, a one-time Italian colony that borders the Red Sea and  
lies between Ethiopia and Sudan, fought a 31-year war for 
independence from Ethiopia that ended with Eritrea becoming an 
independent nation in 1993.

<HEADLINE>  Lehman, Pate Named to Ryder Team  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) -- Captain Ben Crenshaw went with experience  
when he completed the U.S. Ryder Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
	Crenshaw added Tom Lehman and Steve Pate to the U.S. squad on  
Monday, citing their experience in pressure-packed matches as well 
as on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Lehman turned out to be the ``logical choice'' that Crenshaw has  
been talking about all summer. The slight surprise was Pate over 
Fred Couples, who has played more Ryder Cups than any other active 
American but who hasn't been playing much this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at these players and if you look at the way that  
they're playing right now, this summer and onto Boston, I felt like 
Steve Pate was maybe the most intent, and the most determined about 
his game right now,'' Crenshaw said. ``I think it boiled down to 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The wild-card selections give the U.S. team far more experience  
for the Sept. 24-26 matches at The Country Club in Brookline, 
Mass., although that hasn't mattered lately. 
</P>
<P>
	Europe has won the last two biennial matches, and has kept  
possession of the trophy in five of the past seven Ryder Cups. 
</P>
<P>
	And while the U.S. team has won a combined 11 major  
championships and features only one rookie -- David Duval -- only 
four players have ever been on a winning Ryder Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sick and tired of losing,'' said Lehman, who has done his  
part with a 3-2-2 record in his only two Ryder Cups. 
</P>
<P>
	Europe's team will not be finalized until Sunday after the BMW  
International in Munich, Germany. Sergio Garcia played his way onto 
the team by finishing second to Tiger Woods in the PGA 
Championship, and at 19 will become the youngest Ryder Cup player 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Crenshaw's announcement capped a taxing week on the 49-year-old  
captain known as ``Gentle Ben.'' A firestorm erupted over how the 
Ryder Cup profit -- $23 million -- is distributed, and Crenshaw 
publicly singled out Woods, Duval, Mark O'Meara and Phil Mickelson. 
</P>
<P>
	``It burns the hell out of me to listen to some of their  
viewpoints,'' he said earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The dynamic play between Woods and Garcia finally shifted the  
focus back to golf, and Crenshaw declared Monday that a unified 
team would try to win back the cup next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``That issue is behind us,'' Crenshaw said. ``Regardless of what  
happened this week and how it happened, we have to be a team. 
Boston is right around the corner. Unification is a big part of 
this and it's done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couples will miss his first Ryder Cup since 1989, turning the  
experience over to O'Meara and Payne Stewart, who each have played 
on four teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Couples finished 17th in the standings. The only points he  
earned since March was a tie for 10th in the Buick Classic on June 
28, which also was the last time he played until the PGA 
Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mediocre for Fred is tremendous for somebody else,'' Crenshaw  
said. ``But you've got to consider his schedule this year, this 
being a Ryder Cup year. How many times did they play at different 
places? Those things weighed in on the decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crenshaw also skipped over Bob Estes, who made a heroic effort  
to make the team on his own Sunday. Needing a two-way tie for 
fifth, Estes had fourth-place to himself on the 15th hole until he 
bogeyed the next two and tied for sixth. He finished 11th in the 
standings, 13.75 points behind Jeff Maggert. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing lacking in his column was experience,''  
Crenshaw said. 
</P>
<P>
	The same held true for Steve Stricker, who finished 13th.  
Crenshaw also considered Chris Perry and two-time U.S. Open 
champion Lee Janzen, who missed the cut in the PGA Championship and 
was well back at No. 24 in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
	``He could have picked anybody else and they'd all be good  
picks,'' Pate said. ``I'm just glad it was me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pate played only one match in the 1991 Ryder Cup, where he was  
injured in a car accident. He reached the semifinals of the Match 
Play Championship, losing 1-up to Maggert, the eventual champion. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the victim of Duval's 59 on Sunday in the Bob Hope  
Classic, and lost in a playoff against Loren Roberts in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a very fierce competitor who would walk through a wall  
for you if you asked him to,'' Crenshaw said. 
</P>
<P>
	Crenshaw said he spoke with Ryder Cup captains before him and  
countless players on how to use his wild-card selections. Pate's 
name kept coming up, and a phone call from O'Meara on Sunday 
afternoon only bolstered his belief. 
</P>
<P>
	On his way to the airport, O'Meara called Crenshaw and reminded  
him what happened in the 1988 U.S. Open at The Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Meara and Pate tied for third, two strokes out of the playoff.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was sitting right there with Steve,'' Crenshaw said. ``I  
said, 'This is Mark. He said you finished third.'' And he said, 
'Yep, I did.' It was good.''

<HEADLINE>  Lehman, Pate Named to Ryder Team  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) -- Captain Ben Crenshaw went with experience  
when he completed the U.S. Ryder Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
	Crenshaw added Tom Lehman and Steve Pate to the U.S. squad on  
Monday, citing their experience in pressure-packed matches as well 
as on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Lehman turned out to be the ``logical choice'' that Crenshaw has  
been talking about all summer. The slight surprise was Pate over 
Fred Couples, who has played more Ryder Cups than any other active 
American but who hasn't been playing much this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at these players and if you look at the way that  
they're playing right now, this summer and onto Boston, I felt like 
Steve Pate was maybe the most intent, and the most determined about 
his game right now,'' Crenshaw said. ``I think it boiled down to 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The wild-card selections give the U.S. team far more experience  
for the Sept. 24-26 matches at The Country Club in Brookline,

<HEADLINE> 'ER' Star To Earn $27M for 3 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Eriq La Salle will stay in scrubs for three  
more years, and Daily Variety reported Monday it will cost the 
producers of ``ER'' only $27 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner Bros. Television wouldn't comment on the amount. The  
per-episode salary is difficult to peg, Variety said, because the 
contract makes part of the money retroactive to last season. 
</P>
<P>
	If applied only to the next three seasons, La Salle's salary for  
his role as Dr. Peter Benton would be nearly $410,000 an episode -- 
a hefty raise from his current $85,000 per show. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Sassa, the West Coast chief for NBC, recently singled out  
La Salle's character as one of the role models for minority viewers 
the network has been trying to foster.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Pushes Foreign Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The price for shortchanging diplomatic  
work abroad would be paid in ``life and treasure,'' President 
Clinton warned Monday in a speech to the centennial convention of 
the Veterans of Foreign Wars. 
</P>
<P>
	Pushing for full financing by Congress of his foreign affairs  
budget, the president said proposed cuts would undermine U.S. 
efforts to control nuclear proliferation, forge peace in the Middle 
East, try to stop conflicts in Africa and lead in the United 
Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are cutting the very programs designed to keep our soldiers  
out of war in the first place,'' Clinton said. ``Underfunding our 
arsenal of peace is just as risky as underfunding our arsenal of 
war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign affairs operations account for about 1 percent of the  
federal budget. The House has approved $12.7 billion for fiscal 
2000, about $2 billion less than Clinton requested. Clinton said 
that would place a greater burden on the military. 
</P>
<P>
	In his State of the Union address, Clinton advocated increasing  
cooperation with the countries of the former Soviet Union to 
prevent nuclear weapons stockpiles from falling into the wrong 
hands. Congress is considering spending $250 million less than 
Clinton would on containment in former Soviet countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has yet to provide funding that Clinton promised Israel  
and the Palestinians under the Wye River peace negotiations. 
Clinton is optimistic that new Israeli President Ehud Barak will be 
able to seal a deal with PLO chief Yasser Arafat, but he cautioned: 
``If there's a full-scale war in the Middle East, it will affect 
our interests and our values.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He again demanded that Congress fully pay U.S. arrears to the  
United Nations, which he described as a ``legal and moral 
obligation.'' Clinton said supporting the United Nations is crucial 
to maintaining peace in hot spots around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Problems we might have been able to resolve peacefully will  
turn into crises that we can only resolve at a cost of life and 
treasure,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time a president spoke to a VFW convention  
since 1990, when George Bush, a former combat pilot, spoke to the 
delegates during the buildup of the Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
	A small number of veterans tried to organize a boycott of  
Clinton's speech to protest his policies and his lack of military 
experience. But the hall was full, and Clinton's address was 
punctuated by frequent applause. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the last 100 years, America's men and women have  
sacrificed whatever was necessary, not for territorial gain, not 
for domination of others, but to secure the rights and freedom of 
others so Americans might have their freedom secured,'' Clinton 
said. ``You have made our nation proud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Major agenda topics at this year's VFW convention include  
long-term care for veterans and a requested increase in the budget 
of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Advocates say both are 
needed due to the rapidly growing number of aging veterans from the 
World War II and Korean War eras. 
</P>
<P>
	The VFW is seeking a congressional sponsor for a new GI Bill for  
current service members and is pushing for larger defense budgets 
and an increase in military readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization has about 2 million members and is the second  
largest veterans' organization after the American Legion. About 
30,000 people attended the convention.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Racial Segregation Accepted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- About half the young adults in a recent poll  
said racial separation in America is all right ``as long as 
everyone has equal opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the poll released Monday in Washington by Hamilton College of  
Clinton, N.Y., 50.3 percent of respondents said they strongly or 
somewhat agreed with the statement: ``It's OK if the races are 
basically separate from one another as long as everyone has equal 
opportunities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, 47.3 percent of those polled strongly or  
somewhat disagreed with the statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll, co-sponsored by the NAACP and Zogby International,  
surveyed 1001 randomly selected people ages 18 to 29 over one week 
in April and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	``This indicates that many young Americans are comfortable with  
the notion of a segregated society,'' said Phillip Klinkner, 
director of the Arthur Levitt Public Affairs Center at Hamilton 
College. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a cause for concern since many school districts are  
dismantling their integration efforts at a time when new data show 
rising levels of school segregation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other poll findings included:  
</P>
<P>
	--Some 56 percent said the federal government should make sure  
black people receive fair treatment in jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	--About 57 percent agreed that generations of slavery and  
discrimination have created conditions that make it difficult for 
blacks to work their way out of the lower class. 
</P>
<P>
	--Some 54 percent said it was unlikely the United States would  
elect a black president in the near future.

<HEADLINE> Baerga Back With Cleveland Indians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Carlos Baerga, once considered the heart and  
soul of the Cleveland Indians, returned to the team on Monday as a 
backup infielder hoping for yet another chance at resurrecting his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Baerga, who played with the Indians from 1990-96, was acquired  
from the San Diego Padres for a player to be named or cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland plans to use him to back up third baseman Enrique  
Wilson, who in turn can play middle infield to give shortstop Omar 
Vizquel and Roberto Alomar some rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Following San Diego's 7-6 win over Florida on Sunday night,  
Baerga, who earlier this year was back in the minor leagues, was 
told by Padres general manager Kevin Towers that a deal with 
Cleveland was on the table. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, 'Do you want to go?','' Baerga recalled before Monday  
night's game against Texas. ``I said, `Yeah, I want to go.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	After arriving from San Diego early in the afternoon, Baerga was  
back at Jacobs Field for the first time since the Indians traded 
him in 1996. He made his first start for Cleveland since July 25, 
1996, and batted eighth as the Indians opened a four-game series 
with the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	When Baerga came to the plate in the second inning, the 351st  
straight sellout crowd at Jacobs Field gave him a standing ovation 
and he waved to fans before digging in and striking out in his 
first at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
	During his first stint with the Indians, Baerga was one of the  
club's most productive and popular players. He batted over .300 
four straight seasons, and in 1992 joined Hall of Famer Rogers 
Hornsby as the only second baseman to hit .300, have 200 hits, 20 
homers and 100 RBIs in a season. He named to three All-Star teams. 
</P>
<P>
	His energy was infectious in the clubhouse as was his smile, and  
when the Indians went from being baseball's laughingstock franchise 
to legitimate contenders, Baerga became one of the club's stars. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Indians detected a decline in his talent, and coupled  
with concerns about Baerga's off-the-field behavior, the club 
traded him along with Alvaro Espinoza to the New York Mets on July 
29, 1996, for Jeff Kent and Jose Vizcaino. 
</P>
<P>
	``That may have been the toughest day I ever had as a manager,''  
Cleveland's Mike Hargrove said. ``Because he was Carlos. I remember 
saying it then and still meaning it, he was really the heart and 
soul of this ballclub for a long, long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baerga said it took him more than 1 1/2 years to get over the shock  
of the trade. Initially, he was critical of the Indians and 
Hargrove, but said before long he understood that it was a business 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Following an inconsistent 2 1/2 seasons, Baerga was not re-signed  
by the Mets, and he signed as a free agent with St. Louis last 
January. The Cardinals released him during spring training, and he 
signed a minor-league deal with Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	But Baerga felt he should be playing in the majors, and asked  
the Reds for his release in late May. He signed with Las Vegas, San 
Diego's Triple-A affiliate, and after 21 games was promoted to the 
Padres, the same team which gave him his start in 1986. He hit .250 
in 33 games with San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people who went through what I went through this year  
would have retired,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	With starting third baseman Travis Fryman, out with a knee  
injury, not expected to be ready until September, the Indians were 
looking for a dependable backup for Wilson, a middle infielder 
forced to play third. 
</P>
<P>
	``Carlos gives us more options so we can give some of our  
regulars some rest,'' Hargrove said. ``I'm glad to have him here. I 
think it's going to be good for us. The energy level, the 
experience he has of playing in big games and big situations, I 
think it's a perfect fit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baerga realizes he needs to perform well to have a future in  
Cleveland beyond the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my house; this is where I started, '' he said. ``I'm  
just looking to help the team.''

<HEADLINE> Sprinter Johnson Banned from Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Ben Johnson is gone for good from track  
and field, and Javier Sotomayor won't be back for at least two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, the Canadian sprinter who was banned for life in 1993  
after a second positive drug test, lost his bid for reinstatement 
Monday, while Sotomayor, the Cuban world record-holder in the high 
jump, was told he must face doping charges over his positive 
cocaine test. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Amateur Athletic Federation rejected a  
petition to allow Johnson to return to competition. The IAAF's 
decision-making Council accepted the recommendation of a special 
three-man panel which studied the 37-year-old sprinter's case. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF said the ruling was final, with no possibility of an  
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, a Canadian arbitrator ruled that Johnson should be  
allowed to seek reinstatement on grounds that he did not have all 
his appeals explained to him by the Canadian federation when he was 
banned for life. But IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri said the 
special panel found that the arbitrator, Graeme Mew, had ``no 
right'' to interfere in a decision of a sport's world governing 
body. 
</P>
<P>
	Reineri said the panel also ruled that Mew ``made a mistake''  
because the Canadian federation had been correct when it banned 
Johnson for life. 
</P>
<P>
	``In their rush to assert supremacy ... the IAAF appears ready  
to allow Mr. Johnson to serve once again as the whipping boy for 
all of athletics,'' his lawyer, Morris Chrobotek, said in a 
statement issued in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was stripped of his Olympic gold medal and 100-meter  
world record after testing positive for steroids at the 1988 Seoul 
Games. After serving a two-year suspension, he received a life ban 
after testing positive for a high testosterone level in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor, meanwhile, faces a possible two-year ban after  
testing positive for cocaine at this month's Pan American Games in 
Winnipeg, Manitoba, where he was stripped of the gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor has denied knowingly taking any banned drug. Cuban  
officials have supported him and suggested his test was manipulated 
as part of a conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The opinion of the Cubans is there is not a doping case,''  
Reineri said. ``The opinion of the doping commission of the IAAF is 
that it is a doping case. They asked the Cuban federation to follow 
the normal procedure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF expects national federations to suspend any athlete  
testing positive for banned drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless the Cuban federation suspends Sotomayor for the mandatory  
two years, the IAAF could ban him, Reineri said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor was defended at the meeting by Cuba's delegate on the  
Council, 1976 Olympic 400- and 800-meter champion Alberto 
Juantorena, the head of Cuba's national track and field federation. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor is scheduled to undergo surgery for a herniated disc  
in his lower back and has withdrawn from the Aug. 21-29 World 
Championships in Seville. 
</P>
<P>
	In other action, the IAAF Council:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Referred British sprinter Doug Walker's drug case to  
arbitration, rejecting the British federation's decision to clear 
him of any drug offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``The council ruled this is a doping case and the British  
federation reached an erroneous conclusion in clearing him,'' 
Reineri said. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, the European 200-meter champion, remains free to compete  
pending a ruling by the arbitration panel. No date was set for the 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Scottish sprinter was banned in March after testing positive  
for the steroid Nandrolone in December. 
</P>
<P>
	A disciplinary committee of UK Athletics cleared him last month  
on grounds that he ingested the banned substance in an ``innocent 
and accidental'' manner. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker has said he doesn't plan to run any more this season.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Formed a special commission to decide whether Kenyan  
steeplechaser Bernard Barmasai should be disqualified for allegedly 
asking a teammate not to beat him at last week's Golden League meet 
in Zurich. 
</P>
<P>
	Barmasai, the 3,000-meter steeplechase world record-holder,  
admitted he asked compatriot Christopher Koskei to drop back before 
the end of the race so he could win. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory allowed Barmasai to remain in contention for a share  
of the $1 million prize which is split among athletes who go 
unbeaten on the Golden League circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Reineri said the IAAF panel would listen to a tape recording of  
Barmai's remarks, review video footage of the race and speak to 
both athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel will submit its recommendations on Aug. 30, the day  
after the end of the World Championships and just before the 
penultimate Golden League meet of the season in Brussels, Belgium, 
Sept. 1 
</P>
<P>
	-- Ratified records in the men's 100 meters (Maurice Greene,  
9.79), mile (Hicham El Guerrouj, 3:43.13) and decathlon (Tomas 
Dvorak, 8,994 points).

<HEADLINE> Dow Closes Up 73.14 at 11,046.79 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- While shares of the nation's major computer  
makers rose sharply, the broader stock market held to slim gains 
Monday, with investors making few bets while they awaited the 
government's consumer price report. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 73.14 to close at  
11,046.79, the index's first close above 11,000 since July 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators ended slightly higher. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 rose 3.09 to 1,330.77, and the Nasdaq composite index 
rose 7.47 to 2,645.28. 
</P>
<P>
	In a quiet session befitting a summer Monday, stock prices  
remained in a narrow range. Much of the Dow's strength came from 
Hewlett Packard, which rose 4 1/4 to 110 1/4 in advance of its fiscal 
third-quarter earnings report. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected  
Hewlett Packard to earn 80 cents per share, compared to 58 cents 
per share a year ago. After the close of trading, the company 
exceeded estimates, turning in operating earnings of 85 cents per 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM, another Dow component, rose 4 to 127 3/8. Larry Rice, chief  
investment officer at Josephthal &AMP; Co. in New York, said those 
stocks provided the most consistent leadership as most investors 
wait to see whether the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates 
later this month in an effort to hold off inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The prospect of higher interest rates has pressured stocks in  
recent weeks, as investors fear corporate profits would be hurt by 
higher borrowing costs. A major relief rally hit the market Friday, 
with the Dow gaining 184.26 points following the report of a 
moderate rise in the Producer Price Index. 
</P>
<P>
	That suggested to many analysts that inflation has not entered  
the economy, and the Fed may raise rates just a quarter of a 
percentage point. 
</P>
<P>
	``Recent evidence suggests, and it is our opinion, that there is  
little reason for the Fed to tighten beyond that amount,'' said 
Mark Keller, chairman of the investment strategy committee at A.G. 
Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. Keller said the market has begun to absorb the 
likelihood of one rate increase, and is poised to rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Commerce Department will release its Consumer  
Price Index, another widely watched gauge of inflation that could 
determine the Fed's course of action at its next policy-making 
meeting Aug. 24. Some analysts said investors appear reluctant to 
make major new commitments until then. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not much of a story until the Fed makes its  
decision,'' Rice said. ``There's a wait-and-see attitude, and it 
may last until the end of summer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While few new merger deals hit the market Monday, Alcoa's bid to  
acquire Reynolds Metals continued to attract attention on Wall 
Street. Reynolds Metals slipped 7/16 to 68 15/16 as the company 
insisted Alcoa's efforts to acquire it are not in the best 
interests of shareholders. Last week, Reynolds rejected a $5.6 
billion offer from Alcoa and has been weighing a bid from 
investment firm Michigan Avenue Partners. Alcoa gained 3/8 to 66 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen Media Research, the provider of TV ratings in the United  
States, rose 4 1/2 to 37 5/16 after agreeing to be acquired by Dutch 
publisher VNU for $2.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange. Composite volume totaled 720.01 
million shares, compared with 829.85 million in the previous 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 1.51 to 622.89, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 4.24 to 779.50. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.23 to 433.82. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 2.24 percent.  
European indexes were mixed, as Germany's DAX index rose 0.7 
percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 0.2 percent, and France's 
CAC-40 closed 0.6 percent higher.

<HEADLINE> Harrah's May Buy Players for $272M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- Players International Inc. said  
Monday it has agreed to be acquired by Harrah's Entertainment Inc. 
for $272 million in cash, and would terminate a merger agreement 
reached earlier with Jackpot Enterprises Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Gambling industry analysts applauded the move, saying it will  
open new markets for Harrah's, particularly in the Houston area. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlantic City-based Players said its board accepted Harrah's  
offer of $8.50 per share -- a 30 percent premium over Players' 
Friday closing price of $6.56 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal surpasses an $8.25-a-share cash and stock for Players  
made by Jackpot, a Las Vegas-based slot machine operator. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately known if Jackpot would come back with a  
higher bid and possibly start a bidding war for Players. 
</P>
<P>
	``The board of directors is reviewing their options,'' Jackpot  
spokeswoman Tina Fleischmann said Monday. ``I can't say we were 
expecting it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackpot and Players shareholders were scheduled to vote Sept. 14  
on their deal, in which Jackpot would pay $6.75 in cash and $1.50 
in Jackpot stock for each Players share. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrah's, based in Memphis, Tenn., said it anticipated entering  
into a binding agreement with Players by Thursday. The deal 
requires approval from regulators and Players shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street liked the Harrah's bid. The company's stock rose 75  
cents to $22.63 a share on the New York Stock Exchange, while 
Players was up $1.34 at $7.91 on the Nasdaq Stock Market and 
Jackpot rose 44 cents to $7.94 on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just another feather in Harrah's cap,'' said analyst John  
J. Rohs at Schroder &AMP; Co. Inc. ``It's a very good move for the 
company. Obviously, it's not a done deal yet, but strategically it 
makes a lot of sense for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal puts Harrah's into two new markets -- Lake Charles, La.,  
and Metropolis in southern Illinois -- allowing the company to add 
two more sites on its ``Total Gold'' frequent user program, Rohs 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal also gives Harrah's access, through Lake Charles, to  
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	The price, which includes assuming $150 million of Players'  
debt, is ``very attractive,'' said Stuart Linde, an analyst at 
Lehman Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrah's is one of the country's largest gambling companies,  
with 18 casinos in the United States under the Harrah's, Showboat 
and Rio names. 
</P>
<P>
	Players International operates two cruising riverboat casinos in  
Lake Charles, La.; a riverboat casino on the Ohio River in 
Metropolis, Ill.; two dockside riverboat casinos in Maryland 
Heights, Mo.; and a horse racing track in Paducah, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, Harrah's would also gain complete control of a  
joint venture it has with Players, operating a landside hotel and 
entertainment facility in Maryland Heights, a St. Louis suburb.

<HEADLINE> Attorney Eyes Young Bride's Motives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITCHFIELD, Conn. (AP) -- The attorney for a 74-year-old man who  
disappeared from a nursing home last week and married a 56-year-old 
woman is questioning the motives of the bride. 
</P>
<P>
	Harry W. Strouse, a wealthy, retired, antiques dealer, has been  
in hiding since sneaking out of the Rose Haven Convalescent Home 
and marrying Molly Bennett Aitken. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple, speaking from an undisclosed location, has said if  
Strouse hadn't fled, his attorney would have involuntarily 
committed him to the nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to go back there,'' Strouse said. ``Call me the  
runaway groom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strouse was reported missing Wednesday. He married Aitken in a  
civil ceremony in New York City on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Strouse's attorney, Peter Litwin, called a news  
conference. He said his client suffers from ``progressive 
dementia,'' and may not be in control of his actions. 
</P>
<P>
	Litwin, who has power of attorney for Strouse, has not accused  
Aitken of stealing from his client, but pointed out that his client 
is wealthy and said that a collection of antique silver is missing 
from Strouse's estate. 
</P>
<P>
	He would not say how much the silver is worth.  
</P>
<P>
	State police confirmed they were investigating.  
</P>
<P>
	Aitkin said she was motivated by love, not money.  
</P>
<P>
	``I love Harry. I will do anything to protect him,'' she said,  
adding that she is well provided for by a trust fund.

<HEADLINE> Fans Mark Death of Elvis Presley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- Elvis Presley fans sobbed at his grave,  
tapped their toes to rock 'n' roll and dressed like their idol to 
mark the 22nd anniversary of his death. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're an Elvis fan, you must be here if you can,'' said  
Jerry Engelby, 57, of Jefferson, Mo., during Sunday night's 
candlelight procession past the legend's grave. 
</P>
<P>
	The event highlights Elvis Week, an annual series of memorials,  
dances and parties that mark the anniversary of Presley's death on 
Aug. 16, 1977. Presley faithful began the vigil the year afterward, 
and have kept it up since. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 4,000 devotees gathered in the street in front of  
Presley's Graceland mansion to light candles from a torch at 
Presley's grave before walking single file up the driveway to the 
grave beside Graceland's swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
	Judy French, 52, of Rolling Fork, Miss., said it's hard to  
explain to others why the faithful keep coming back. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to be an Elvis fan to understand,'' she said. ``We  
love the man.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Presents School Violence Ad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- ``I'm afraid to go to high school,'' a worried  
grammar school boy says in President Clinton's new public service 
announcement that urges parents to talk to their children about 
violence. ``It scares me,'' says another. 
</P>
<P>
	The president and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton today  
presented three frank back-to-school messages in the aftermath of 
shooting sprees in high schools in Colorado and Georgia and copycat 
threats and violence that followed in schools nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The messages, to debut Wednesday on major broadcast and cable  
television networks, include a toll-free number to call for a free 
booklet on how to talk to children, especially those aged 8 to 12, 
about safety and the dangers of weapons and of gang violence. 
Similar radio ads are to begin airing later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	One TV ad begins with a school bell ringing and elementary  
school children discussing a boy whose neck turned red when he was 
choked in a school fight. It ends with Clinton saying: ``Our 
children need our help to deal with tough issues like violence. 
Please talk with your kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In between, students chat about knives in book bags and their  
personal safety at school. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was this kid that was like 17. He came to school with a  
gun,'' a young boy says while sitting in a schoolyard swing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't know if it was fake or real,'' a classmate adds.  
</P>
<P>
	The ads are being privately funded by the Henry J. Kaiser Family  
Foundation, an independent health care philanthropy based in Menlo 
Park, Calif., and Children Now, an independent advocacy group for 
children in Oakland, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not the kind of issue that our parents had to deal  
with,'' says Lois Salisbury, president of Children Now. ``We know 
from all of our research that parents do seek this kind of 
guidance. They welcome it and it gives them the support they need 
to talk with their kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ads are an outgrowth of a White House strategy session on  
children, violence and responsibility in May that followed the 
April 20 shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo. Two 
students wearing black trenchcoats killed 12 classmates and a 
teacher and injured 23 others before committing suicide at the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	A month later, a student wounded six of this high school  
classmates during a shooting spree at Heritage High School in 
Conyers, Ga. Other shootings have occurred in Mississippi, 
Kentucky, Arkansas and Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	``One recommendation from the summit was to focus on supporting  
parents and helping them talk about issues like violence with 
children,'' said Tina Hoff, a spokeswoman for the Kaiser 
foundation. ``Our research shows that there is a window of 
opportunity with preadolescents when they're most receptive to 
messages from their parents.''

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestinians Make Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israelis and Palestinians negotiating the Wye  
peace accord have made some progress on secondary issues, but 
remained deadlocked today on the key question of how long an 
Israeli troop pullback from the West Bank will take. 
</P>
<P>
	The high stakes were apparent as security officials from both  
sides searched for Islamic militants suspected of planning a 
bombing attack against Israelis. A bomb exploded, apparently 
prematurely, in the West Bank town of Hebron on Sunday. No one was 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, in Egypt for talks with  
President Hosni Mubarak, said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak was 
causing difficulties with an interpretation of the U.S.-brokered 
Wye River accord that was ``far away from the text.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, returning to the Gaza Strip, Arafat welcomed a report  
that President Clinton, in a letter to Barak, had expressed 
reservations about the prime minister's request to combine the 
final phase of troop pullbacks mandated under Wye River with 
complex so-called final status negotiations on the most contentious 
issues dividing the two sides. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Barak said Israeli and Palestinian negotiators  
were no closer to an agreement after a meeting Sunday on a 
timetable for Israel to withdraw from parts of the West Bank as 
mandated under the U.S.-brokered Wye agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	However, she said, they had made some progress on other issues,  
such as the release of 750 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli 
jails. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't say sweeping progress was made,'' Merav  
Parsi-Tsadok said. However, movement on secondary issues improved 
the atmosphere of the negotiations and would ``have implications 
for the Wye timetable,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Barak told his Cabinet on Sunday that the timetable  
dispute would be resolved within 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Israel had agreed  
to provide the Palestinians with a detailed list of prisoners being 
held and a list of those released last November by Barak's 
predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu. Erekat is to meet Barak's envoy, 
Gilead Sher, again on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinians are angry that most of the 250 prisoners  
released by Netanyahu were common criminals rather than what the 
Palestinians call political prisoners -- those jailed for 
anti-Israel attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The crux of the dispute, however, remained Barak's reluctance to  
implement the third of three West Bank troop pullouts mandated by 
Wye, which calls for the Palestinians to be given another 11 
percent of the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu pulled troops out of 2 percent of the territory before  
freezing compliance with the pact, and Barak has agreed to a 
further 5 percent withdrawal beginning October 1. 
</P>
<P>
	But he has been pushing the Palestinians to postpone the last  
withdrawal from 6 percent of the West Bank until February 2000 and 
to negotiate at the same time the complex ``final status'' issues, 
including the borders of any new Palestinian state, the fate of 
Jewish settlements and sovereignty over Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinians have vehemently rejected that plan, and want  
the pullout wrapped up by mid-November. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has publicly urged both sides to  
implement the Wye accord in a timely fashion, although it has said 
it would not object to minor adjustments to the schedule. A U.S. 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity indicated that 
combining the third withdrawal with final status talks would not be 
considered a minor adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Palestinian police arrested several dozen activists  
from the militant Islamic group Hamas late Sunday night in Hebron, 
a Palestinian security source said, speaking on condition of 
anonymity. Police were looking for two brothers who allegedly 
prepared the car bomb that went off Sunday, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli media reports said it was believed that Hamas activists  
intended to use the bomb against Jewish settlers in Hebron, which 
has traditionally been a flashpoint for violence in the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Ex-NBA Player Dismissed of 2 Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A judge on Monday dismissed the two most  
serious charges against ex-NBA player Dontae' Jones in connection 
with a spring shooting outside a Nashville nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 24, was accused of simple assault with bodily injury,  
reckless endangerment and felony vandalism after a shootout outside 
the Players Draft House club April 25. Seven people were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	General Sessions Judge Michael Mondelli dismissed the reckless  
endangerment and felony vandalism charges after the testimony of 
Darryle L. Tyce, a security guard, during a preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who has been free on $8,000 bond since his arrest, was  
bound to the grand jury on the assault charge. If convicted, he 
would face a maximum of 11 months and 29 days in jail and a $2,500 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I protested my innocence,'' Jones said after the hearing.  
``When this is all over with, I'll go back to doing what I do best, 
and that's play basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who grew up in Nashville, led Mississippi State to the  
Final Four and was MVP of the Southeastern Conference tournament in 
1996. He was then drafted by the New York Knicks in the first 
round, and subsequently traded to the Boston Celtics who released 
him in January. 
</P>
<P>
	He was scheduled to play with La Crosse of the CBA this fall as  
part of his effort to make it back to the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyce said he didn't see Jones shoot at him April 25 outside the  
club, though he did see Jones' friend Karshma Dardy hand Jones a 
gun shortly before the shooting began. In an affidavit, Tyce had 
previously claimed that he saw Jones fire at him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many times, detectives will help with the wording of the first  
statement,'' prosecutor T.J Haycox said. ``It's not uncommon for a 
witness to think about it and change some details.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyce said he couldn't see if Jones shot at him because he was  
turning away and ducking for cover. Tyce was shot in the stomach, 
and required surgery to remove eight inches of his colon. 
</P>
<P>
	The simple assault with bodily injury charge against Jones stems  
from Vergena Forbes, who was collecting admission at the door of 
the club April 25. Forbes testified that Jones used profanity as he 
threatened her, and lunged towards her because he wanted money. 
</P>
<P>
	The club was the site of a party for organizers of a downtown  
Nashville music festival when things started getting rowdy, Tyce 
said. When he started shutting down the club early at the owner's 
direction, music performers were upset they wouldn't be allowed to 
perform. 
</P>
<P>
	Friction between a group of rappers from Memphis and Jones'  
entourage developed over the money collected at the door of the 
club, Tyce testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Mondelli bound charges of reckless endangerment and felony  
vandalism against Jones' friend Dardy over to a grand jury.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 25.33 at Midday / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were modestly higher today as investors  
awaited the next inflation indicator and tried to assess whether 
the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
25.33 at 10,998.98. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also up slightly. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was up 2.76 at 1,330.44, and the Nasdaq composite 
index was up 16.71 at 2,654.52. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said some investors were locking in profits from  
Friday's big rally, when the Dow gained 184.26 points and the 
Nasdaq soared 88.32. Stocks rose after a moderate rise in the 
Producer Price Index suggested the Fed might not need to implement 
a big rate hike to fight inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed has already raised rates once this year, and has  
signaled its willingness to do so again if it believes the economy 
is growing too fast. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Commerce Department will release its Consumer  
Price Index, another widely watched gauge of inflation that could 
determine the Fed's course of action at its next policy-making 
meeting Aug. 24. Many analysts believe investors will be reluctant 
to make major new bets until then. 
</P>

	Hewlett Packard rose 4 15/16 to 110 15/16. The computer maker

<HEADLINE> Man Dies Skydiving After DWI Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SILOAM SPRINGS, Ark. (AP) -- The morning after being arrested on  
his second driving-while-intoxicated charge, a man fell to his 
death when he failed to deploy his parachute during a jump from 
4,500 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Fletcher Southerland, 23, was arrested Saturday and  
released from jail the next day. He jumped to his death later 
Sunday from a plane used by a company called Skydive Skyranch, 
where Southerland was a regular. 
</P>
<P>
	Southerland was an experienced parachutist and used his own gear  
for the jump -- his 95th. 
</P>
<P>
	``He went into a deliberate maneuver called a track,'' said Wolf  
Grulkey, the Skyranch owner and pilot of the plane. ``It moves you 
across the sky horizontally. We never saw his chute open, and 
immediately we thought something was wrong. It appears he may have 
wanted to take his own life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Southerland had been unconscious or had a malfunction, he  
would have tumbled as he fell, Grulkey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Grulkey said Southerland's rig was equipped with a device that  
would have automatically deployed a parachute at 750 feet. The 
lines connecting Southerland's reserve chute to his harness had 
been cut, he said. Southerland had borrowed a knife from a staff 
member before boarding the plane, Grulkey said.

<HEADLINE> Thompson Placed on Disabled List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- After Justin Thompson's rough start Sunday,  
Detroit manager Larry Parrish said the left-hander was ``mentally 
beat up.'' Now the Tigers are giving him a couple of weeks off to 
check out physical problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, 9-11 with a 5.11 ERA, was placed on the 15-day  
disabled list Monday because of neck and shoulder problems. 
Thompson, an All-Star in 1997, has led the Tigers in innings 
pitched, strikeouts and complete games the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Right-hander Matt Anderson was recalled from Triple-A Toledo to  
replace Thompson on the roster. 
</P>
<P>
	The move came a day after Thompson gave up six earned runs in  
five innings during a 10-2 loss to Anaheim. Thompson is 0-3 with a 
9.82 ERA in four starts since July 21. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's tried to pitch through this for a while, but the time has  
come where we have to get his neck and shoulder checked out,'' 
Parrish said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson will have an MRI exam on Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's just something I've been battling all year. I've been  
having just a roller coaster ride, just up and down,'' Thompson 
said. ``Finally I just said I can't do it no more. I can't go out 
there and get beat up and not give our team a chance to win. I need 
to go ahead and get this thing healthy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parrish said Sunday that Thompson might not start again this  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel confident I'll be back,'' Thompson said. ``If I get  
well and I feel like I'm able to go out there and throw and be 100 
percent, then I won't be happy if they shut me down. But I'm not 
coming back until I'm 100 percent. I know not everyone is going to 
be 100 percent every start, but you can't go out there and pitch 
feeling like I have. ``I can't really remember the last time I went 
out there and actually felt good. I don't even know where the ball 
is going when I throw it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Willie Blair (1-9) will make Thompson's scheduled start Saturday  
at Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, who turns 23 Tuesday, was touted as the Tigers'  
``closer of the future'' when he was Detroit's top pick in the 1997 
amateur draft. His 100 mph fastball quickly made him a fan favorite 
when he was called up last season. 
</P>
<P>
	But he had a 6.08 ERA in 24 appearances as a late-inning set-up  
man this year before he was sent to Toledo on June 7. He had a 6.39 
ERA with the Mud Hens, allowing nine home runs and 31 walks in 38 
innings.

<HEADLINE> Monroe Wedding Suit To Be Auctioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The suit Marilyn Monroe wore when she married  
Joe DiMaggio will go on the block next month at Sotheby's. 
</P>
<P>
	The brown wool suit with a white mink collar and rhinestone  
buttons is expected to fetch between $15,000 and $20,000 at the 
Sept. 30 sale, Sotheby's spokesman Matthew Weigman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Monroe wore the suit when she married DiMaggio on Jan. 14,  
1954. 
</P>
<P>
	Rival auction house Christie's is selling more than 1,000 Monroe  
items at a mega-Marilyn auction on Oct. 27-28, including the 
``eternity band'' given to her by DiMaggio and the silk gown with 
6,000 hand-sewn beads she wore when she sang ``Happy Birthday'' to 
President Kennedy in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
	The ring has a pre-sale estimate of $30,000 to $50,000. The

	MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Prosecutors have dropped an aggravated  
battery charge against rapper Luther Campbell, who was arrested 
last month after he allegedly hit a man with a whiskey bottle. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell, the former front man of 2 Live Crew, began arguing  
with Mathieu Fabrice at a nightclub, then smashed a bottle of Jack 
Daniels against his face, police said.

the July 5 incident. Fabrice suffered cuts and a possible broken 
nose. 
</P>

	Don Ungurait, a spokesman for the state attorney's office, said  
Monday the charge was dropped due to conflicts among the witnesses

<HEADLINE> Bailey, Heck To Start for Redskins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FROSTBURG, Md. (AP) -- It took just three weeks of training camp  
-- and one exhibition game touchdown -- for Champ Bailey to earn a 
starting cornerback job for the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 7 overall draft pick took his place among the first-team  
unit Sunday, promoted over Darryl Pounds after a 46-yard 
interception return for a score in Friday night's 20-14 victory at 
New England. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what I've been working toward,'' Bailey said. ``It was  
one of my goals and come out and start as a rookie. It took a lot 
of hard work. Darryl Pounds is a great corner, so I don't think it 
was anything that he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey and Pounds actually started Friday's game, but only  
because Darrell Green had a jammed finger. Now, with Green back at 
practice, Pounds has been relegated to backup and nickel duty. The 
coaches expect Bailey to start the remaining exhibition games, and, 
of course, the regular season opener against Dallas on Sept. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got better each and every week,'' defensive backs coach  
Tom Hayes said. ``He's doing a lot of good things. Is he there yet? 
No. He needs to continue working, and he needs to keep on pace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey wasn't the only player moving up the depth chart Sunday.  
Andy Heck started working with the first unit at left tackle ahead 
of Joe Patton, who gave up a sack on a blown assignment Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had some problems early with protection,'' coach Norv  
Turner said. ``I thought (moving Heck up) was the appropriate thing 
to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coaches expected Heck, an 11-year veteran, to be their starting  
left tackle when he was signed as a free agent in June, but he's 
done little to stand out. He struggled at times Sunday, getting 
knocked to the ground more than once and finding defensive end 
Marco Coleman to be a handful. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've just been trying to knock some rust off from the  
offseason, learning this system as best I can,'' Heck said. 
``There's a lot of evaluating left to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Heck or Patton can't hold the position, the only alternatives  
left on the current roster are career backups Kipp Vickers and 
Jamie Brown. Shar Pourdanesh, who has 36 NFL starts at tackle, was 
upset when he was demoted to the second-team earlier in camp and 
was traded to Pittsburgh on Friday for a seventh-round draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Bailey, he scored the first time he touched the ball,  
bringing back memories of Green doing the same as a rookie 16 years 
ago. Green returned a punt 61 yards in the exhibition opener 
against Atlanta in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey said he had a gut feeling the throw was coming his way  
from Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe, who was calling an audible 
at the line of scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
	``He checked, he looked at me, he looked back the other way, and  
it was just the anticipation of a quick throw,'' Bailey said. ``I 
just happened to be on my toes at the right time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, competition for two other positions remains wide  
open. Turner said he would alternate running backs Skip Hicks and 
Stephen Davis with the first-team unit this week before deciding 
which player starts Friday against Buffalo. Davis started against 
New England. 
</P>
<P>
	At kicker, Brett Conway and Cary Blanchard will both handle  
kickoffs and field goals against the Bills. Jeff Hall will sit out 
the game after missing badly on a 23-yard attempt against the 
Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't give up. I'm going to keep working,'' said Hall, a  
sixth-round draft pick. ``What if I'd made a game-winning field 
goal? What if? Am I going to base the rest of my football career on 
one kick? So whether it's good or bad, there's another day coming, 
another practice, and hopefully after that another game.''

<HEADLINE> 3 Ariz. Cardinals Hurt in Car Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- A former first-round draft pick trying to  
resurrect his football career with the Arizona Cardinals was 
fighting to save his right arm after a car accident involving two 
teammates on their way to a team meeting Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ernest Dye, a 28-year-old tackle, was listed in fair condition  
at Flagstaff Medical Center, where he was still undergoing 
extensive surgery Monday evening. Doctors were attempting to repair 
a fractured humerus -- the bone between the shoulder and the elbow -- 
and at least one of the arteries that supplies blood to his right 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``He suffered a near-amputation of the arm,'' said team  
physician Dr. Wayne Kuhl, who spoke with Dye's surgeon, Dr. Tim 
Bonatus. ``It's a question of saving the arm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonatus said Dye's arm was crushed rather than severely cut,  
``leaving the viability of the arm in question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The next step following surgery comes occurs during the next 24  
hours when doctors attempt to re-establish and maintain blood flow 
in the arm, Bonatus said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dye was injured during a single car rollover accident about 25  
miles south of Flagstaff, where the Cardinals are holding training 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Department of Public Safety reports of the crash,  
Cardinals guard Lester Holmes was driving Dye's black 1995 Mercedes 
north on Interstate 17 about 10:15 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The car was traveling about 75 mph during a heavy rain when it  
veered into the median and rolled. 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive end Carl Simpson and Dye were ejected from the  
vehicle. Only Holmes was wearing a seat belt. 
</P>
<P>
	No citations had been issued Monday. The crash remains under  
investigation, Officer Mark Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes, 29, was listed in good condition with a cut on his  
forehead and was being kept overnight at the hospital. Simpson was 
released from the hospital after being checked for pain in his left 
hip. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes, an 8-year veteran, is the most experienced starter on a  
patchwork offensive line. Lomas Brown left the team as a free agent 
after last season and Chris Dishman has been lost temporarily 
following arthroscopic elbow surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson is currently listed as a starter on the defensive line,  
which is without tackle Eric Swann, who is recovering from a knee 
injury, and tackle Mark Smith, who is in the midst of a prolonged 
contract dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	The 340-pound Dye is trying to resurrect his professional  
football career. 
</P>
<P>
	Dye was the Cardinals' first-round draft pick out of South  
Carolina in 1993, but was plagued by injuries. He left the team as 
a free agent in 1997 to sign with St. Louis. He was out of football 
last year following the suicide of his brother and his father's 
fatal heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinals spokesman Paul Jensen said he did not know when any of  
the players might be able to return to practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``The players' safety and welfare are all we're concerned with  
at the moment,'' he said. ``That can be addressed in due time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the team was scheduled to continue with practice  
Monday afternoon, team spokesman Greg Gladysiewski said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all hoping and praying everything will work out for  
them,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Titans' Debut Spoiled by Mistakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Tennessee Titans wanted their  
exhibition opener to be the start of a whole new era for the team. 
They're still waiting. 
</P>
<P>
	``An awful start,'' coach Jeff Fisher said Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	The Titans stumbled out of the gate in the 22-20 loss at Kansas  
City on Sunday night as their first two possessions ended in an 
intentional grounding for a safety and an intercepted pass returned 
for a touchdown. The much-improved pass rush didn't touch the 
quarterback once. 
</P>
<P>
	Receivers dropped five balls, while the defense missed two  
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	But Fisher sounded much more positive after watching the film,  
pointing out the Titans have plenty of time to improve with three 
more exhibition games before the season opener on Sept. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	``Big plays against the defense will hopefully diminish and the  
big plays in our offense ... should increase as the preseason goes 
along,'' Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve McNair, who has spent the offseason working on his  
passing, was the third-best quarterback for the Titans despite 
being the starter. He was 6-of-11 for 66 yards and one touchdown 
compared to backup Neil O'Donnell who was 10-of-17 for 73 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher quickly doused any questions about McNair, who has missed  
several practices due to a stiff back in training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no concern whatsoever about our starting quarterback  
being Steve McNair. It's preseason. These are things you learn from 
... I do know what he's capable of. There is not going to be a 
quarterback controversy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Donnell, signed to a one-year deal, has picked up the Titans'  
offense quickly. But he reverted to his old snap count a couple of 
times, including one time before he had even gotten under the 
center. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the beauty of the preseason,'' Fisher said.  
</P>
<P>
	The defensive line, which has four new players, also looked good  
to Fisher. He liked what he saw from rookies Jevon Kearse and John 
Thornton. Kearse keyed a goal-line stand in the first quarter with 
a hit that allowed linebackers Joe Bowden and Barron Wortham to 
stop Bam Morris. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very optimistic and encouraged about the potential that we  
have there to increase the pressure on the quarterback despite the 
fact it didn't necessarily show up,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no reason to be alarmed.''  
</P>
<P>
	Once the Titans got moving, they looked like the Oilers of last  
year with Eddie George doing most of the work. The Titans have 
promised since last season ended that they will throw the ball deep 
to take the pressure off George. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher said nine deep pass plays were called even though McNair  
completed the longest pass at 22 yards. He said the game plan will 
be more complicated Friday night when the Titans visit the Arizona 
Cardinals.

<HEADLINE> T-Bills' Interest Rates Fall / T-Bills  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury  
securities fell in Monday's auction. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department sold $8 billion in three-month bills at  
a discount rate of 4.680 percent, down from 4.790 percent last 
week. An additional $8 billion was sold in six-month bills at a 
rate of 4.900 percent, down from 4.915 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-month rate was the lowest since July 26 when the bills  
sold for 4.535 percent. The six-month rate was the lowest since 
Aug. 2 when the rate was 4.750. 
</P>
<P>
	The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors  
-- 4.815 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,881.70 and 5.108 percent for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,752.30. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the  
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index 
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 5.23 
percent last week from 5.13 percent the previous week.

<HEADLINE> Sosa Homers Off Johnson for No. 47 </HEADLINE>

<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Sammy Sosa hit a two-run homer off Randy Johnson  
in the sixth inning Monday night for his 47th home run of the 
season, tying him with Mark McGwire for the major league lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa had struck out in his last five at-bats against Johnson in  
the past week, twice in this game. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the sixth, the Cubs star connected against the Arizona  
ace for a 456-foot shot into the eating area outside Friday's Front 
Row restaurant in the second deck in left field. It was his fourth 
homer in his last three games. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa's 47th homer came in Chicago's 117th game. Last year, he  
also hit No. 47 on Aug. 16, in Chicago's 124th game.

<HEADLINE> Fumbles Pose Threat to Buffalo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREDONIA, N.Y. (AP) -- The Buffalo Bills rushed for 188 yards in  
their exhibition opener against Seattle. Not too bad an effort. 
</P>
<P>
	But subtract quarterback Rob Johnson's 53 yards, remember that  
starter Antowain Smith is hobbled by sore groin and add in the 
fumbles of backup Jonathan Linton and suddenly, the Buffalo ground 
game is a lot scarier on paper than it is on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who led Buffalo with 1,124 yards in his second season  
last year, started training camp with a bang then came up limping 
and has been unable to go full speed in practice for any length of 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Shawn Bryson, the team's third-round draft pick and a Tennessee  
teammate and close friend of second-round selection Peerless Price, 
was lost for the season when he tore a knee ligament last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss of Bryson increased the load on Linton, who was cured  
by coaches of a tendency to drop the ball last year. Linton 
relapsed in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of four drives led by Doug Flutie early in the game ended  
with fumbles by Linton, two of which were lost. Linton recovered 
his own fumble on a fourth-down play at the goal line that should 
have been a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no excuses for that,'' Linton said Monday. ``That  
should never happen. It was just lack of focus and lack of 
concentration. I can't let that happen if I want to be part of this 
football team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bills are losing patience with Linton, who has a habit of  
holding the ball too low when he makes his cuts. Protecting the 
ball is key for Linton, a straight-ahead back who is more likely to 
run over an opponent than around him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had some concern with Jonathan,'' Bills coach Wade  
Phillips said. ``Hopefully this game helped him, because we've been 
on him in practice about the same thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A loose grip cost Linton the confidence of his coaches last  
year, after he fumbled near the goal line in an exhibition game 
against Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got him to where he felt comfortable holding the football,  
then he kind of reverted back this year,'' Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been on him in practice and talked to him in meetings.  
Once we get him out of that he'll be fine, because he ran the ball 
good; he just didn't hold on to it. But that's not good enough.'' 
</P>

	Buffalo has to be worried about Smith, even though Smith isn't.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's still some tightness,'' he said. ``But if there was a  
game today I'd be able to play, so I'm not really concerned about 
it too much. But it's going to take some time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Gray, a rookie free agent from Western New Mexico who  
was listed third on the depth chart, carried 13 times for 74 yards 
and scored on a 24-yard run in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	On the touchdown run, Gray dodged one defender as he broke  
through the line and eluded another in the secondary. ``It looks 
like he may have enough talent to run in this league,'' Phillips 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo led the AFC last season in turnover ratio, collecting 11  
more than it lost and making that area of its game a priority. 
</P>
<P>
	But while the coaches fumed over Linton's fumbles, Flutie  
shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just write them off as a bad day,'' said Flutie, recalling  
that four fumbles and one interception cost the Bills a playoff win 
against Miami last year. ``Those days are going to happen, but you 
hope to minimize them and hope they don't happen at the wrong 
time.''

<HEADLINE> Dodge Gets `Different' Ad Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- ``The New Dodge'' is getting old, so  
the Dodge division of DaimlerChrysler AG is replacing it with a 
different slogan. 
</P>
<P>
	The automaker's new slogan: ``Dodge Different.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Our customers today have told us we're different, different  
than we used to be and different from our competitors,'' said Jim 
Julow, division vice president. ``We're going to wear the 
`different' term like a badge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new campaign officially begins Sept. 1 with a series of  
print ads. Television and outdoor advertising will follow 
nationwide Sept. 7, though some billboard ads will be displayed in 
the Detroit area starting this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Dodge says the new tagline will accompany its largest print and  
television campaign in the division's 85-year history. The campaign 
was created by BBDO Worldwide's Southfield office. 
</P>
<P>
	The print ads show no cars, opting instead to make their point  
in simple, graphic terms. One ad, for example, shows six folded 
white dress shirts. Above the ``Dodge Different'' line is a red, 
unfolded Hawaiian print shirt. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``New Dodge'' campaign began in 1992 with the introduction  
of the '93 Intrepid sedan, which marked the start of an overhaul of 
Dodge's model line that previously was dominated by versions of the 
boxy K-cars.

<HEADLINE> Painter Ion Pacea Dies at 74 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- Romanian painter Ion Pacea, whose  
images of peasant women and shepherds have been exhibited on three 
continents, has died. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	Pacea died Friday after suffering a long, undisclosed illness,  
Ioana Berenda of the Romanian Artists' Union said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Pacea, famed for his simple oil paintings in vivid color, was  
inspired by peasant women, shepherds, birds, flowers and other 
symbols of the Romanian countryside. 
</P>
<P>
	During his career, he participated in numerous exhibitions in  
New York, Sao Paulo, Ankara, Munich, Rome and other cities. His 
last exhibition was at Bucharest's National Art Museum in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1981, he was awarded the Italian Trionfo prize. He also was  
honored with a medal from the Caravaggio cultural center in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Horopan, Macedonia, in 1924, he was loved for his  
personality as much as his work. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was very modest and very polite with everyone,'' said  
Berenda. ``He was one of a golden generation. There are not many 
left like him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His funeral will be held Tuesday. Pacea is survived by a wife  
and a son, both painters.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Seeks Funds in Puerto Rico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Mining for campaign funds and votes  
in Puerto Rico, Bill Bradley allied himself Monday with local 
leaders who oppose turning the island into the 51st U.S. state. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as the people of Puerto Rico select commonwealth  
status, I will respect that commonwealth status and work with the 
people of Puerto Rico and Congress to even obtain more autonomy,'' 
the Democratic presidential candidate said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a nonbinding December referendum, voters rejected statehood  
by 54 percent to 46 percent. As a commonwealth, Puerto Rico's 3.8 
million residents are U.S. citizens but can't vote for president or 
Congress. The island, which is solidly Democratic, does send 
delegates to the presidential nominating conventions. 
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Rico is unfriendly ground for Bradley: pro-statehood Gov.  
Pedro Rossello serves on Vice President Al Gore's campaign staff 
and is one of his top fund-raisers, and most of the local party 
leadership supports Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	The pro-commonwealth faction of the local Democratic party, led  
by San Juan Mayor and gubernatorial candidate Sila Calderon, is 
disillusioned with the Clinton administration for what it sees as 
White House support for Rossello's statehood drive. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Bradley openly courted that faction.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know that just like in the rest of the country, there are  
people here who support me,'' he said. ``I'm looking for delegates 
... and each delegate is important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He got a warm response from Calderon's supporters.  
</P>
<P>
	``Up to this point, he of all the candidates has spoken most  
clearly to the people of Puerto Rico,'' said Anibal Acevedo Vila, 
who is running for Puerto Rico's nonvoting seat in the U.S. 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley was expected to raise thousands of dollars at a luncheon  
and a dinner at San Juan's Ritz-Carlton Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	A handful of business leaders attended Bradley's news  
conference, including contractor Ruben Velez, who surfaced during a 
1997 Republican probe into Clinton's campaign fund-raising. He 
appeared in a videotape trying to give Clinton a check during a 
visit to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said he was ``troubled'' by U.S. Navy exercises on the  
outlying Puerto Rican island of Vieques. The Puerto Rican 
government wants the Navy to leave Vieques, saying frequent bombing 
runs have stunted economic development and hurt the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there has been humanitarian and environmental damage  
that is unacceptable,'' Bradley said of Vieques. But he refused to 
take a position on the dispute until a commission appointed by 
Clinton presents its recommendations later this month.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Insurance Mulls Foreigners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong  
said Monday the insurance industry may be liberalized to allow new 
foreign players. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at an insurance conference, he said Singapore's  
closed-door policy towards life insurers, in place since the 
mid-1980s, has insulated the domestic market from international 
trends. 
</P>
<P>
	``For Singapore to become a world class financial center, and  
for Singaporeans to have access to high quality insurance services, 
our industry must keep abreast of developments in the international 
financial services market,'' Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee said Singapore aims to become the top insurance hub in Asia  
by 2003, complementing its efforts to build a vibrant debt market 
and sophisticated asset management and banking industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee, who also heads the Monetary Authority of Singapore, noted  
that Singapore's insurance industry needs to look into ways of 
improving performance. 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested local companies consider consolidation or seeking  
strategic alliances with foreign companies.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani, Indian Troops Trade Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAMMU, India (AP) -- Pakistani troops fired machine guns and  
rockets at an Indian border post today, killing one soldier and 
wounding six others in a two-hour battle, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistani forces opened fire before dawn during an attempted  
infiltration by Muslim militants into the Indian state of 
Jammu-Kashmir, police said on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian troops responded with machine-gun fire and forced the  
infiltrators back across the border, police said. An Indian soldier 
was killed and six Border Security Force members were wounded, 
three seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee accused Pakistan in a  
speech Sunday of training and arming militants waging war in 
Kashmir, and ordered them to stop. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of Islamic militant groups in Kashmir have been fighting  
a 10-year insurgency that has left more than 25,000 people dead. 
Some of the groups want independence for Kashmir, while others are 
seeking to join neighboring Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack destroyed most of the Indian border post at Charwah,  
50 miles south of Jammu, the winter capital of Kashmir, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	India says attacks by militants have increased since the Indian  
army launched a campaign in May to oust Pakistan-based fighters 
from the Himalayan heights of Kashmir. By late July, most of the 
Islamic fighters had been pushed back across the cease-fire line 
that divides the disputed region between India and Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	But skirmishes along the border and guerrilla attacks have  
continued. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indian government contacted the International Committee of  
the Red Cross today to arrange repatriation of eight Pakistani 
prisoners of war from the Kashmir fighting. An offer for their 
return had been made Friday to the embassy of Pakistan, which has 
not acknowledged that any of its soldiers were fighting on the 
Indian side of the cease-fire line. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, separatist militants killed five people and wounded  
15 in bomb explosions and an attack on a police station in Kashmir, 
local officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Terrorists are being trained in Pakistan,'' Vajpayee said in  
his speech marking India's 52nd anniversary of independence from 
Britain. ``They are killing innocent people and targeting women and 
children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif made the same charge  
against Indian forces in his Independence Day speech on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	India and Pakistan -- the world's newest nuclear powers -- have  
fought two wars over Kashmir, India's only Muslim-majority state. 
</P>
<P>
	In the worst violence in Kashmir on Sunday, guerrillas fired  
automatic rifles and rocket launchers at a remote police station in 
Chenani, 50 miles north of Jammu. 
</P>
<P>
	When police reinforcements came from a neighboring town, the  
guerrillas set off a land mine and opened fire on their vehicles 
from a mountaintop. Four officers were killed and 12 wounded, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba rebel group sent a fax to The  
Associated Press claiming responsibility for the attack in Chenani. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, police said a civilian was killed in cross-fire between  
militants and officers in Anantnag, 40 miles south of Kashmir's 
summer capital, Srinagar. 
</P>
<P>
	In other violence blamed on separatists Sunday, two bombs  
exploded in the northeastern state of Assam, killing one person and 
wounding two others, a district police official said on condition 
of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribal militants are fighting for an independent homeland in the  
northeast. More than 10,000 people have been killed in fighting in 
Assam over the past decade.

<HEADLINE> Coffee Tumbles, Cotton Rises  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Coffee futures prices plummeted Monday, with the September  
contract falling to a five-year low, on news that cold weather over 
the weekend in Brazil apparently had little impact on the crop. 
</P>
<P>
	On other commodity markets, soybeans, corn and cotton all  
jumped. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee prices on Monday gave back the gains made Friday when  
prices rocketed higher on forecasts that a cold front could move 
through growing regions in Brazil, the world's largest producer. 
The front, however, never reached any coffee plantations, and 
prices tumbled. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we saw was the market's collective response to the  
realization that although there were patches of weekend frost ... 
there was no statistically significant damage,'' said Arthur 
Stevenson, an analyst with Prudential Securities Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a massive move and we had very heavy trading volume,''  
he added. ``It was a dramatic day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee prices have slumped over the past year with inventories  
of gourmet arabica beans high and demand in the U.S. low, as it 
always is in summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee for September delivery fell 8.85 cents to 89.75 cents a  
pound Monday on the Board of Trade of the City of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans and corn futures prices were higher in trading Monday  
on the Chicago Board of Trade on a forecast of dry Midwest weather. 
</P>
<P>
	A new dry spell would further stress crops already under  
pressure from July's heat wave. 
</P>
<P>
	Many traders continue to believe the crop production report  
released last week was overstated for corn supplies, providing 
further support for prices, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans were also supported by word that China may be in the  
market for soybeans, as well as soy oil and meal. 
</P>
<P>
	Gains in soybeans prices were tempered by feelings that, the dry  
weather aside, recent rains may have benefited the crop. Market 
participants were also cautious ahead of the release of crop 
ratings after markets closed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat prices followed corn and soybeans higher at the open but  
then turned slightly lower to close mixed. Weak export news, 
countered by support from soybeans and corn, led to a choppy trade. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Monday, wheat for September delivery rose 1/2 cent to  
$2.68 3/4 a bushel; September corn was up 4 1/2 cents to $2.14 a bushel; 
September oats were unchanged at $1.09 a bushel; and August 
soybeans were up 10 1/2 cents to $4.56 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, livestock and meat futures were mixed on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle rose 0.30 cent to 66.35 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle fell 0.07 cent to 77.20 cents a pound; October lean 
hogs rose 0.27 cent to 45.42 cents a pound; and August pork bellies 
rose 1.00 cent to 53.30 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Cotton futures were sharply higher Monday on the Board of Trade  
of the City of New York, with the December contract reaching a 
seven-week high. The market has received support from continued 
stress on the crop in the American South. 
</P>
<P>
	A few weekend showers did little to alleviate dry crops  
throughout the region, and high temperatures continued. 
</P>
<P>
	Cotton for October delivery rose 0.65 cent to 53.55 cents a  
pound.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Fall / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's benchmark stock index closed the Tuesday  
morning session down slightly after investors took profits 
following a strong gain the previous day. The dollar rose against 
the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 6.19 points,  
or 0.03 percent, to 17,819.84 at the end of the morning session. On 
Monday, the average finished up 390.86 points, or 2.24 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 114.89 yen at midday, up 0.05 yen from its  
level of 114.85 yen late Monday in Tokyo and above its level of 
114.65 yen late Monday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, the Nikkei index fell on profit taking  
after a 2.2 percent gain the previous day, but underlying sentiment 
was still good as foreign investors continued to hunt for 
relatively inexpensive securities, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tokyo has had six straight days of market gains, so there is  
some profit-taking movement out there,'' said Kazunori Jinnai, 
deputy general manager of the equity department at Daiwa Securities 
SB Capital Markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 3.83 points, or 0.26 percent, to 1,472.34. The 
TOPIX closed up 26.02 points, or 1.80 percent, on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In foreign exchange, the dollar rose marginally after Japanese  
institutional investors bought back oversold positions, a trust 
bank trader said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 121.22 yen, down  
from 121.58 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond  
yield rose to 1.9500 percent from its close Monday of 1.9250 
percent, driving its price down to 98.73 yen from 98.94 yen Monday.

<HEADLINE> Text of Lamar Alexander's Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Lamar Alexander's statement Monday announcing his withdrawal  
from the race for the Republican presidential nomination: 
</P>
<P>
	Thank you for coming. I may learn a lesson from this. I seem to  
be attracting more attention getting out than I did getting in. So, 
thank you very much for being here. 
</P>
<P>
	I'm ending my campaign for the presidency today. My heart tells  
me to keep going, and so do a lot of telephone calls this morning, 
but there's really no realistic way to do that. 
</P>
<P>
	My purpose in running for the presidency was to push to the top  
of the national agenda two issues: Parents and schools. And in my 
conversations with the other candidates today and in the coming 
weeks, I'm going to encourage them to pick up the two most 
important ideas that I advanced. Number one, that we triple the tax 
deduction for each child to $8,000, make it worth what it used to 
be, and extend that deduction to the care of an elderly relative. 
And number two, that we create a pilot $1,500 Hope Scholarship for 
middle- and low-income children to give them choices of good, safe 
neighborhood schools. 
</P>
<P>
	I've been privileged to see this country, this magnificent  
country, in a way that very few people have ever seen it. I 
wouldn't swap those experiences for anything. Honey and our family 
and our friends both here in Tennessee and across this country have 
been enormously loyal and enormously generous, and for that I am 
deeply grateful. 
</P>
<P>
	I'm especially grateful to Governor Terry Branstad of Iowa, our  
national campaign chairman and to Ted Welch, our national finance 
chairman, and to our staff and to hundreds of volunteers across 
this country. 
</P>
<P>
	And I hope that the successful Republican nominee for president  
of the United States, whomever he or she may be, does a remarkably 
good job of bringing out the best in our country as we face what 
ought to be an exciting new century.

conduct joint research on a missile defense system aimed in part at 
shielding Japan from North Korean attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura and U.S. Ambassador Thomas  
Foley signed and exchanged diplomatic notes on the program, the 
Foreign Ministry said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, first proposed by Washington and Tokyo last year,  
includes infrared sensors to detect enemy missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	The system is intended to guard against incoming ballistic  
missiles flying within a 1,860-mile radius by detecting them with 
satellites and shooting them down before they hit their targets. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's Cabinet approved the plan last week.  
</P>
<P>
	The signing comes as fears are mounting that North Korea is  
preparing to test fire a long-range ballistic missile. The isolated 
communist country test fired a missile a year ago that sailed over 
Japan and into the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese Defense Agency and the U.S. Defense Department are  
also scheduled to exchange a separate memorandum of understanding 
dividing up the research work between the two countries, the agency 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo and Washington will share an expected $440 million to $525  
million tab for the research, with Japan shouldering $175 million 
to $265 million of it, according to Japanese news reports.

<HEADLINE> Pageant Eases Swimsuit Guidelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- The Miss America Pageant hopes to  
boost ratings by easing restrictions on the types of swimsuits 
contestants can wear, stopping short of allowing anything too 
skimpy. 
</P>
<P>
	The pageant, which already announced it was cutting back on the  
number of talent acts it broadcasts, will hit the airwaves an hour 
earlier this year to draw more viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	There will also be scoring changes, with more emphasis on  
contestant interviews, pageant chief Robert Beck said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the pageant began allowing contestants to wear  
two-piece swimsuits that fell within recommended guidelines for 
color and style. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've taken away the details for the rules and left it to  
their common sense as long as they use some judgment,'' Beck said. 
``We're giving them another opportunity to be themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thongs or bikinis, however, are still forbidden.  
</P>
<P>
	``That wouldn't really match up with a family show,'' Beck said.  
</P>
<P>
	Swimsuits can be solid colors or prints and won't have to meet  
any measurement guidelines, though contestants must still register 
their swimsuit in advance. 
</P>
<P>
	The 79th annual Miss America Pageant airs Sept. 18 on ABC. Donny  
and Marie Osmond will be co-hosts.

<HEADLINE> Questionable Assumptions / Commentary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *AP Business Analyst    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Assumptions have a tendency to persist, even  
when an assumption is shown to be questionable. 
</P>
<P>
	Such as, for example, the assumption that the jobs being created  
in the 1990s are inferior to the manufacturing jobs that have been 
lost. It doesn't get much support from the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	Statistics show that in the past four years, 9 million new jobs  
have been added to the economy, and that 7 million of them have 
been in managerial, technical and professional categories. 
</P>
<P>
	As cited by Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI, the educational level also is  
improving. Over the past five years, college grads have accounted 
for 63 percent of the increase in the working-age population. And 
the number of high school dropouts has fallen. 
</P>
<P>
	Such evidence suggests strongly if not convincingly, that jobs  
are being created for more than hamburger flippers. Or, perhaps, 
that McDonald's is employing well-educated flippers. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Judging from the number of initial public offerings, or IPOs, on  
the stock market, it is understandable you might think that new 
companies are being formed at a record pace. Not so. 
</P>
<P>
	Business startups actually fell 7 percent in 1998, according to  
Dun &AMP; Bradstreet, whose calculations are generally accepted as the 
final word. Moreover, new-business employment fell 4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	People often assume that when the economy is strong, so also is  
business formation. But if last year's numbers -- and those of 
several other years too -- are an indicator, the opposite is true. 
</P>
<P>
	D&AMP;B identified 155,141 startup establishments in 1998, down from  
166,740 in 1997. Jobs fell to 906,105 from 939,310. The falloff was 
in every industry but agriculture and finance. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The late Julian L. Simon, a University of Maryland professor,  
spent two decades seeking to undermine what he said were imperfect 
perceptions about the environment, resources and population. 
</P>
<P>
	You might have noticed that much of the news about such economic  
categories has tended toward the dismal. Needlessly so, said Simon, 
who believed a great gap existed between perception and reality. 
</P>
<P>
	``The current gloom and doom about an environmental crisis is  
all wrong on the scientific facts,'' he argued, and more often than 
not he won his arguments. Bias, he suggested, was inherent. 
</P>
<P>
	An example: Attendees at an Audubon Society meeting were asked  
their estimates of how much of landfill volume was from fast-food 
packaging. Responses averaged 20 percent to 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The actual volume, said Simon, was no more than one-third of 1  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	How did he account for such misperceptions? Psychological and  
cultural mechanisms make people more receptive to bad news than 
good, he suggested. And, he said, journalists just didn't 
understand statistics, while politicians used them in service of 
policy goals. 
</P>
<P>
	His findings are collected in his last book, ``Hoodwinking the  
Nation,'' published by Transaction Publishers and available from 
the Cato Foundation, Washington, D.C.

<HEADLINE> Corn, Beans Futures Higher at Close / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybeans and corn futures prices were higher in  
trading Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid news of dry 
Midwest weather on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
	The dry weather forecast for the Midwest could further stress  
crops already under pressure from July's heat wave. 
</P>
<P>
	Many market participants continue to believe the crop production  
report released last week was overstated for corn, providing 
further support for prices, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans were also supported by word that China may be in the  
market for soybeans, as well as soy oil and meal. 
</P>
<P>
	Gains in soybeans prices were tempered by feelings that, the dry  
weather aside, recent rains may have benefited the crop. Market 
participants were also cautious ahead of the release of crop 
ratings Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat prices followed corn and soybeans higher at the open but  
then turned slightly lower to close mixed. Weak export news, 
countered by support from soybeans and corn, led to a choppy trade. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Monday, wheat for September delivery rose 1/2 cent to  
$2.68 3/4 a bushel; September corn was up 4 1/2 cents to $2.14 a bushel; 
September oats were unchanged at $1.09 a bushel; and August 
soybeans were up 10 1/2 cents to $4.56 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, livestock and meat futures were mixed on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle rose .30 cent to 66.35 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle fell .07 cent to 77.20 cents a pound; October lean 
hogs rose .27 cent to 45.42 cents a pound; and August pork bellies 
rose 1.00 cent to 53.30 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls in Quiet Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar lost ground against the euro and the  
yen in a quiet session Monday, as traders avoided risk in advance 
of the release Tuesday of the Consumer Price Index figures on U.S. 
inflation at the retail level. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro rose to $1.0575 from $1.0564  
late Friday. The dollar also was quoted at 114.68 Japanese yen, 
down from 115.74. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in a risk-reduction period prior to the release of the  
CPI numbers,'' said Ricardo Gomes, head of foreign exchange at 
Republic National Bank. ``Everyone wants to see where those numbers 
stand before heading in a new direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The market is awaiting the CPI report because it comes a week  
before Federal Reserve policy-makers meet to decide whether to 
raise interest rates for a second time this summer. The Fed raised 
rates slightly on June 30 in a pre-emptive bid to prevent a 
resurgence in inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Gomes predicted that the U.S. stock and bond markets will rise  
or fall Tuesday based on the CPI numbers, and that the dollar would 
follow the lead of those two markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.5154 Swiss francs, down from  
1.5159 Friday, and 1.4835 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4764. The 
British pound fell to $1.6013 from $1.6057. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Monday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8500 German 
marks, down from 1.8515; 6.2029 French francs, down from 6.2112; 
and 1,830.9 Italian lire, down from 1.831.5.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Probes Stanford Drug Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- State officials are investigating the  
legality of a Stanford University program that tested a powerful 
psychiatric drug on teen-age inmates, the Los Angeles Times 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to put up with wards being used as guinea  
pigs,'' Hilary McLean, Gov. Gray Davis' spokeswoman, told the 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, the state attorney general and the state  
inspector general were ordered to look into the ``legality of 
Stanford's study,'' McLean said. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight-week Stanford experiment took place in 1997 at a  
detention facility in Stockton. Sixty-one boys and men, ages 14 to 
18, were given Depakote -- a drug used to treat seizures and mania -- 
to see if it would curtail aggression; all agreed to take part, the 
newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the youths appear to have been harmed, according to  
subsequent examinations. However, state officials question whether 
the drug tests were in the best interest of the teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the legal sense, and maybe in the moral sense, we missed  
the boat on this one,'' said Robert Presley, the state's top 
corrections official. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford officials said the facility's former medical director,  
Dr. Dan Cashman, assured them the testing was legal. 
</P>
<P>
	To end the confusion, Presley issued a directive two weeks ago,  
stating the youth detention centers cannot conduct, or allow anyone 
else to conduct, medical research on inmates unless it meets the 
governor's approval and is codified into law.

<HEADLINE> Roberson Out for Season With Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STARKVILLE, Miss. (AP) -- Senior cornerback Kendall Roberson tore  
a ligament in his left knee and is out for the season, Mississippi 
State football coach Jackie Sherrill said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior tight end Terrence McCaskey will miss six weeks after  
dislocating a small bone in his left wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	The two were injured in non-contact drills, Sherrill said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Both injuries are very unfortunate because they did not result  
from contact,'' Sherrill said. ``Terrence was simply trying to 
break his fall during passing drills when he hurt his wrist, and 
Kendall's injury occurred when he planted and came back for a ball 
during defensive back work. Both were freak deals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCaskey, 6-foot-6 and 262 pounds, had started six of the 35  
games he played with the Bulldogs. He was the heir apparent starter 
at the position following the graduation of Reggie Kelly, who is 
now with the Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberson, 6-foot and 205 pounds, played in 31 games, starting  
27.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Sailor Wants Money for Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- For years, Jack Crittenden feared that  
people might discover his secret -- that he was among 50 black 
seamen court-martialed for mutiny after refusing to load ammunition 
in the wake of a deadly 1944 explosion on Navy transport ships. 
</P>
<P>
	When people asked about his military service, he told them he  
was in the Army. Even his wife didn't know he had really been in 
the Navy, and it was years before his children knew of his past. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the 74-year-old retired Alabama state employee has  
reconciled himself to the conviction. He says he won't ask for a 
pardon, an effort being pursued by Freddie Meeks, the only other 
known survivor of the group convicted of mutiny at the Port Chicago 
Naval Magazine near San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a pardon means freedom from punishment, and I've already  
served my time and been punished -- I really have a problem with 
understanding it,'' Crittenden said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meeks, 79, of Los Angeles, asked for a presidential pardon in  
May, arguing that the military prosecution was racist. A 1994 Navy 
legal review concluded the black seamen faced racial prejudice but 
found no grounds to overturn their courts-martial. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  
and the World War II Black Navy Veterans of Great Lakes have called 
on President Clinton to clear the soldiers' names. Great Lakes was 
where the seamen went through basic training. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House has said the matter is under review.  
</P>
<P>
	Crittenden doesn't want to stand in the way of a pardon, but  
said he would rather see the families of the 320 men killed in the 
blast get the full death benefits they are owed with interest. 
</P>
<P>
	He said each family should have received around $5,000 in  
benefits, but Congress reduced that amount to about $3,000 for the 
Port Chicago victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``My concern is that my country, my Navy, do the right thing,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	For Crittenden, a Greenville native and Republican who headed  
the state Office of Minorities and Women in Business from 1986 to 
1998, the tragedy and shame of Port Chicago had always clouded his 
civilian life. That ended a few years ago when the TV show 
``Unsolved Mysteries'' featured the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it was difficult to tell his story, Crittenden said the  
segment helped him come to terms with the explosion -- the worst 
domestic loss of life during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had tears running down my face, just thinking about what  
happened,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Crittenden said he had just reported for guard duty at the  
barracks about 9 p.m. on July 17, 1944, when a blinding light lit 
up the sky, first white, then blue. Seconds later it was followed 
by an earsplitting noise. The next thing Crittenden knew, he was 
picking himself up off the ground outside the barracks. He had been 
thrown about 50 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was hollering and screaming just all over the place,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two transport ships carrying ammunition had blown up, killing  
320 Navy men and injuring 390, and destroying the ships, a train, a 
pier and the base. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-thirds of those killed were members of the all-black loading  
crews that stacked bombs and other explosives aboard the ships. 
</P>
<P>
	Gathering to look for survivors at the waterfront, the seamen  
faced a gruesome scene. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw a foot in a boot, an arm on top of the water, heads here  
and there, pieces of the ships,'' Crittenden recalled. ``If I had 
any knowledge of that kind of an explosion, I never would have gone 
down there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, the district commander gathered all the black  
seamen and told them they would be going back to work loading 
ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
	The commander threatened to shoot any who refused and those who  
questioned the decision or asked for transfers were arrested and 
held on a barge out in the bay, while white officers were given 30 
days' leave to deal with the trauma, Crittenden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Crittenden, then 19, said he was so fearful of another explosion  
he went absent without leave, but was arrested within hours and 
detained. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with the men held on the barge, he was tried for mutiny  
and found guilty. He served about eight months of a 15-year 
sentence before being paroled. 
</P>
<P>
	Crittenden went on to serve the Navy in the Philippines before  
being discharged in 1946. He later graduated from Alabama State 
University and become a football coach at Lowndes County Training 
School. He went into business for himself and began working for 
state government in 1986 before retiring last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the Port Chicago explosion remains a mystery.  
Crittenden said he didn't think it was due to the inexperienced 
workers loading the munitions.

<HEADLINE> Landon's Widow Sues Globe </HEADLINE>

<P>
	SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- Michael Landon's widow filed a $5  
million defamation lawsuit against the Globe tabloid for portraying 
the couple's marriage as troubled. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit, filed Friday, said the Globe falsely reported on July  
6 that the ``Little House on the Prairie'' and ``Highway to 
Heaven'' star was involved in ``such things as illegal drugs and 
pornography.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the headline ``Michael Landon: The Shocking Truth,'' the  
Globe said, ``There was a dark side behind that handsome face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``These statements are simply not true,'' Cindy Landon said in a  
statement Monday. ``And I am outraged that the press feels that it 
can make any statements it wants about a person, no matter how 
damaging and no matter how false, when that person is dead and 
unable to defend himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Landon died of cancer in 1991.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a frivolous lawsuit and we are going to vigorously defend  
it,'' Globe attorney Mike Kahane said.

<HEADLINE> Senators, Yashin Unable to Agree </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OTTAWA (AP) -- Ottawa Senators center Alexei Yashin made it clear  
Monday that unless the last year of his contract is redone, he 
won't be there when training camp opens on Sept. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really tough to say, but at this point it doesn't look  
good,'' Yashin said before teeing off in his charity golf 
tournament at nearby Rivermead. 
</P>
<P>
	Yashin was to fly to Florida on Tuesday to participate in  
pre-training camp workouts with about 25 other Russians and NHLers. 
It might be the closest he comes to playing in the NHL for a while. 
</P>
<P>
	Yashin and his agent, Mark Gandler, were rebuffed by Senators  
general manager Marshall Johnston when they brought up the subject 
of renegotiating Yashin's contract, which has one more year on it. 
</P>
<P>
	Yashin is due to make $3.6 million this season, a bargain price  
for the NHL's sixth leading scorer last season with 94 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talked to the team and thought they'd be happy to know  
what's going to happen for a few years, but it was a completely 
different response,'' Yashin said. ``It wasn't especially great. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love this city and I want to play in Ottawa. It's tough to  
play when you're wondering about your future. The (club's) response 
was hard and it came right away. It didn't make us feel very 
good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yashin said the topic was brought up because ``there was a  
feeling in the air about what was going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he doesn't want to play this year wondering what's going  
to happen after the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want my mind to be 110 percent on hockey,'' he said. ``It's  
hard to play. People will say you're selfish in front of the net to 
get a good contract. I'm also captain of the team, so I think it's 
important to be totally fair to hockey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yashin could be a restricted free agent next summer, but said he  
thinks his bargaining position is strongest right now. He pointed 
to the few offers restricted free agents receive in today's market 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want Marshall and Mark to talk and find a good agreement for  
the future,'' he said. ``It can change any time. I hope it will.''

<HEADLINE> Counselor Sued for Advising Abortion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A couple is suing their daughter's school  
guidance counselor for advising the 17-year-old to get a secret 
abortion and telling her, ``Someday you'll look back on this and 
laugh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The federal lawsuit, filed Monday, also accuses counselor  
William Hickey of cashing checks from the girl's boyfriend using 
school district bank accounts, lying to teachers so the girl could 
miss school and drawing her a map so she could drive to the clinic 
in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit said the Hatboro-Horsham School District allowed a  
climate that violates state law requiring consent of a parent or 
guardian for a minor to get an abortion. The parents said another 
counselor made overtures to help their daughter out of her 
``situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	School district officials had no immediate comment. Hickey did  
not immediately return a call. 
</P>
<P>
	The family is seeking unspecified damages for emotional  
distress. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl went through with the abortion and told her parents  
about it afterward.

<HEADLINE> Utah, Wis. To Receive Disaster Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton declared parts of Utah and  
Wisconsin disaster areas Monday and ordered federal funds be spent 
to help those states recover from devastating storms. 
</P>
<P>
	The disaster money, which will be handed out by the Federal  
Emergency Management Agency based on the states' requests, will pay 
75 percent of the costs for debris removal, emergency services and 
restoring roads, buildings and utilities. 
</P>
<P>
	In Utah, where a tornado ripped through downtown Salt Lake City  
on Aug. 11, the federal funding will be available to individuals 
and local governments in Salt Lake County. The assistance can 
include housing and low-cost loans for uninsured property losses. 
</P>
<P>
	In Wisconsin FEMA will manage similar federal aid to at least 10  
counties where severe storms and flooding caused damage beginning 
on July 4. After Clinton's declaration, FEMA Director James Lee 
Witt on Monday designated Ashland, Bayfield, Douglas, Florence, 
Iron, Oneida, Price, Rusk, Sawyer and Vilas counties as being 
eligible for federal aid. Witt said more Wisconsin counties may be 
added to the list based on new damage assessments. 
</P>
<P>
	A White House spokeswoman said no estimate was yet available for  
the total dollars the federal government expects to spend on 
disaster aid in those states.

<HEADLINE> Bucs QB Family Safe After Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Eric Zeier's smile gave way to a burst of  
laughter. 
</P>
<P>
	The family of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback escaped  
serious injury in the crash of a small plane over the weekend. 
Knowing everyone was back home safely allowed him to make light of 
not being told about the accident until after an exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to have a little talk with them,'' the fifth-year  
pro said Monday of his mother's request that the news not be 
relayed to him during the game because she didn't want him to 
worry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, our motto here is family first. I have a wife and a  
little baby at home. Her family and my family, we're all very 
close. Regardless of what goes on on the football field, that's 
what's really important. You've got to take care of your family and 
take care of all those people who are close to you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zeier's parents and sister were flying from their home in  
Marietta, Ga., to Tampa for Saturday night's exhibition against 
Cleveland when the Cessna 172 piloted by his father lost power and 
attempted an emergency landing near Chiefland, southwest of 
Gainesville. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Zeier, 48, was making the trip with his wife, Sharon, 49;  
daughter, Ellen, 21; and James Strickland, 25. No one was seriously 
injured when the plane clipped a power line, flipped and came to 
rest upside down. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mom said my dad did a tremendous job of flying the plane  
down. It was just a miracle,'' said Zeier, who learned of the 
accident as he was leaving the field after the Bucs' 30-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even when I knew everybody was OK, I was shaken up because I  
could imagine the fear that they felt in the air. It's a scary 
thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zeier said his father received his pilot's license about a month  
ago, so information vital to making emergency landings was fresh in 
his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``Under the circumstances, my dad did a really good job of  
getting the plane to where they could have landed safely,'' Zeier 
said. ``It's just one of those things. We haven't been able to 
figure out why it happened or what happened. Who knows. I'm just 
thankful everybody's OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Tony Dungy granted the quarterback time off to be with his  
family. But after speaking with his parents by telephone, Zeier 
decided against making the 100-mile drive from Tampa to Chiefland. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said: `No, don't worry about it.' ... They had some bumps  
and bruises and were beat up a little bit. But they said everything 
was fine and they rented a car and got on the road pretty early 
(Sunday).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zeier, a backup obtained in a draft-day trade with the Baltimore  
Ravens, was 11-of-16 for 135 yards and one interception in his 
preseason debut for the Bucs. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he appreciated his family not wanting the accident to  
become a distraction for him, Zeier said he would have preferred to 
have been given the news immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously it does shake you up a little bit, but I could have  
gone and played. It would have been tough. Who knows how I would 
have played or what I would have done? But something like that, it 
would have been nice to know,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Regardless of what goes on on the field, whether it's a  
regular season game or a preseason game, you've got priorities in 
your life. ... It doesn't mean I don't take football seriously. I 
take football as seriously as anyone, but you really can't put 
football ahead of those things.''

<HEADLINE> Son, Dad Drown After Rescue Attempt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TWO RIVERS, Wis. (AP) -- A birthday celebration at a state park  
turned deadly Monday when a young boy and his father drowned in 
Lake Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims were identified as Paul Boersma, 37, and his son  
Zacherie, 9, Manitowoc County Deputy Coroner Bonnie Kretsch said. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims' extended family had gathered at Point Beach State  
Park to celebrate the boy's tenth birthday next week, according to 
sheriff's Inspector Kenneth Petersen. 
</P>
<P>
	``The boy was out swimming in the lake with a couple of his  
cousins. They got in trouble with some undertows. The lake was kind 
of rough (with) 2- to 5-foot waves,'' Petersen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two cousins made it back to shore and alerted relatives  
about the missing boy. The child's father jumped in the lake to 
rescue his son and was also pulled under by strong undercurrents, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a notice on a chalkboard Monday at the park entrance,  
reading: ``Attn. Swimmers -- Strong Current!''

<HEADLINE> Christopher Reeve Meets With Doctor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Christopher Reeve and leading experts on spinal  
cord injuries met for the first time under new state legislation 
created to help find a cure for the estimated 200,000 Americans 
with spinal cord paralysis. 
</P>
<P>
	The group was named by Gov. George Pataki in January to head the  
New York State Spinal Cord Injury Research Board. The board will 
recommend particular research efforts for state funding. 
</P>
<P>
	The actor, who has been paralyzed since 1995 when he was thrown  
from a horse, said creation of the board in New York was important 
because of the state's large number of research facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The money will be used well here,'' Reeve said during a press  
briefing Monday.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Family Stabbed Before Blast </HEADLINE>

<P>
	PORTERVILLE, Calif. (AP) -- A man apparently killed his wife and  
two of their daughters before killing himself and their youngest 
child in a house fire, police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	All five bodies were found last week in a bedroom of their  
house. They were burned beyond recognition and investigators pieced 
together the slaughter after autopsies were performed. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnulfo Gonzalez, a part-time pizza delivery man who also worked  
for Wal-Mart, apparently repeatedly stabbed his 25-year-old wife, 
Erica, 11-year-old stepdaughter Monica Lopez and 3-year-old 
Jasmine, Police Chief Bud Garman said. 
</P>
<P>
	A flammable liquid was spread through the bedroom, causing an  
explosion that killed Gonzalez and year-old Alejandra. The wife and 
two older daughters were stabbed before the explosion, autopsy 
results showed. 
</P>
<P>
	Police don't know why he did it, police Capt. Silver Rodriguez  
said. Police have no record of domestic violence calls and found no 
evidence suggesting anyone outside the home was involved.

<HEADLINE> Teammates Remember Reese As Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- At first, Randy Willis wasn't quite sure  
why his father was so excited. 
</P>
<P>
	The two were enjoying a minor league baseball game when his  
father, Henry, pointed out an older man sitting several rows behind 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told me it was Pee Wee Reese,'' Willis, 34, said before  
teeing off Sunday at a Louisville golf course located on a street 
named for the famous Brooklyn and Los Angeles Dodgers captain. ``I 
was only about 20 at the time and didn't really know who he was. 
But my dad knew everything about him. He went on and on about what 
a great player and a great man he was. 
</P>
<P>
	``He must have seen us looking at him because as he got up to  
leave, he came over and introduced himself, just out of the blue. 
You should have seen the look on my dad's face. I'll never forget 
it. And I know my dad never did either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reese, the Hall of Fame shortstop who helped ease the way for  
Jackie Robinson to break baseball's color barrier, died about 4 
p.m. Saturday at his Louisville home. 
</P>
<P>
	Reese, who overcame prostate cancer years ago, underwent  
radiation treatment for lung cancer in March 1997 after doctors 
removed a malignant tumor. He had been ill in recent years and had 
dramatically reduced his public appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall of Famer Duke Snider called Reese the greatest Dodger of  
them all. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you asked anyone on the ballclub how Pee Wee Reese helped  
him, they would say not only in baseball, but in their lives. 
Without his help, I never would have been a Hall of Fame player. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is the finest person I think I've ever met,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	An eight-time All-Star, Reese sparked the Dodgers to seven  
National League pennants. He led Brooklyn to its only World Series 
championship in 1955, fielding the final ball in a 2-0 victory in 
Game 7 at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Inducted into baseball's Hall of Fame in 1984, his plaque at the  
Cooperstown, N.Y., institution only touches on his significance to 
the game and to those around him: 
</P>
<P>
	``Harold Henry `Pee Wee' Reese, Brooklyn, N.L., 1940-1957, Los  
Angeles, N.L., 1958. Shortstop and captain of great Dodger teams of 
1940s and `50s. Intangible qualities of subtle leadership on and 
off field, competitive fire and professional pride complemented 
dependable glove, reliable base running and clutch hitting as 
significant factors in 7 Dodger pennants. Instrumental in easing 
acceptance of Jackie Robinson as baseball's first black 
performer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Don Zimmer was one of a number of shortstops brought up to  
dislodge Reese. None ever did. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I played, if you came up as a shortstop, the starting  
shortstop wouldn't even talk to you,'' Zimmer said. ``When I got to 
Brooklyn, Pee Wee was like a father to me. That's the way it's been 
to this day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was Reese's friendship with Robinson for which he will be  
most remembered. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pee Wee had a very simple nature,'' said former Brooklyn  
pitcher Carl Erskine, a teammate of Reese and Robinson for nine 
seasons. ``He saw things as they were. He was not going to be 
anyone's savior. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was just a southern boy who saw through (the bigotry). Pee  
Wee avoided ever taking a stand (publicly). He played a neutral 
role. He was a supporter (of Robinson) without being a crusader.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees manager Joe Torre grew up in Brooklyn rooting for the  
rival New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	``He managed me in a game when I was 16 and played a sandlot  
game at Ebbets Field,'' Torre said before Sunday's game with 
Minnesota. ``He told my brother, Frank, that I must really like the 
groceries because I was a fat kid. I got a double that game. I 
always respected him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reese was born on July 23, 1918, on a farm in Ekron, Ky., and  
moved to Louisville with his family as a child. He gained the 
nickname Pee Wee not because of his size -- he was listed at 
5-foot-10 and 160 pounds -- but from his prowess at marbles. A ``pee 
wee'' was a common type of marble. 
</P>
<P>
	All was quiet Sunday on Pee Wee Reese Road in east Louisville.  
No ribbons, flowers or other tributes placed on the street sign 
bearing his name leading into Seneca Park -- which most likely was 
the way Reese would have wanted it. 
</P>
<P>
	``As famous as he was, he was just a regular guy,'' said Mary  
Barney, director of baseball operations for Louisville's AAA 
baseball team. ``He really was just the man next door.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral services for Reese will be held Wednesday at Southeast  
Christian Church in Louisville. Visitation will be held from 2-4 
p.m. and 6-8 p.m. Tuesday at Pearson's Funeral Home.

<HEADLINE> Union Bank of Calif. To Cut Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Union Bank of California disclosed plans  
today to shed 1,400 workers, or 15 percent of its work force, in an 
effort to boost profits and expand other parts of its business. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the layoffs will be in southern California, although  
about 100 to 200 will be in the San Francisco Bay area. Employees 
will get four weeks to a year of severance pay, depending on 
seniority. 
</P>
<P>
	UnionBanCal Corp., the bank's San Francisco-based parent, said  
the layoffs will boost pre-tax profits by $135 million. Net 
earnings will rise another $90 million through increased fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Union Bank shares were up less than 1 percent in morning trading  
today, rising 25 cents at $38 a share on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said the changes will allow the bank to expand its  
ATM network, open a new branch, add telephone customer service 
clerks and improve Internet banking. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has had a reputation for benevolence toward  
employees. When it was created with the combination of Union Bank 
and Bank of California four years ago, it avoided the mass layoffs 
typical of bank mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	But last year, the ailing Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, which owns  
64 percent of Union Bank, sold stock to American institutional 
investors who demanded a better return on their investments. 
</P>
<P>
	Union Bank has 241 offices in California, and six in Oregon and  
Washington. It had $32.4 billion in assets as of June 30.

	The $12 billion that venture capitalists showered on  
entrepreneurs during the first six months of the year represents a 
62 percent increase over the same period a year ago, the firm said. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are the good old days,'' said Kirk Walden, national  
director of venture capital research for PricewaterhouseCoopers, 
which publishes the Money Tree Survey. ``Any entrepreneur with a 
technology idea and a good business plan should be able to get 
funding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the number of companies that received venture capital  
investments during the second quarter rose 30 percent to 992, up 
from 763 during the same three-month period a year earlier. And the 
average size of an investment rose 57 percent to $7.4 million, 
compared to $4.9 million in the second quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Walden said the striking increase in the amounts of money  
flowing from venture capitalists to start-up companies ``forces me 
to conclude that venture capitalism is now an integral part of the 
U.S. economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morever, Walden predicted that the broader distribution of  
investment dollars will ultimately result in increased innovation 
and productivity because technology will be allowed to move forward 
at a faster rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Venture capitalists raise money from a variety of investors and  
then re-invest the money in fledgling businesses. The venture 
capitalist firms generally receive low-cost stock in return for 
their investment. 
</P>
<P>
	Should the start-up company stay afloat and eventually complete  
a successful initial public offering of its stock, the shares 
become much more valuable and the venture capitalists see a huge 
return on their investment. 
</P>
<P>
	This formula has been particularly successful in recent years,  
as venture capitalists have helped numerous new Internet businesses 
survive until they can raise additional money through an IPO. 
</P>
<P>
	So experts said it's hardly a coincidence that start-up Internet  
companies received about half of the record second quarter bounty, 
or $3.8 billion. Overall, technology companies received $6.9 
billion in the second quarter, or 90 percent of the total amount 
distributed. 
</P>
<P>
	Jesse Reyes, managing director of Venture Economics, a Newark,  
N.J., firm that tracks venture capital trends, said large 
corporations have contributed to the surge in overall venture 
capital investing by jumping into the spending spree. ``It's the 
dot-com factor,'' he said. ``No one wants to be left out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, venture capital firms were the primary investors in  
start-up companies, and the firms did so for the sole purpose of 
reaping returns on their investments, Reyes explained. But large 
corporations are now getting into the act -- especially in the 
burgeoning online world -- for strategic rather than financial 
purposes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Large telecommunications and cable companies, for example, have  
been pouring money into Internet start-ups to gain a stronger 
foothold on the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	PricewaterhouseCoopers' survey found that the investment  
largesse is finding its way across the country. Companies located 
in Silicon Valley attracted the most money during the 
record-breaking second quarter, receiving $2.7 billion. New 
England-based companies followed with $1.1 billion, and the New 
York metropolitan area, the Los Angeles/Orange County region and 
the Southeast each received more than $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
	John Barry, a general partner with Prospect Street Ventures, a  
New York venture capital firm that invests in information 
technology companies, said Silicon Valley will likely remain the 
focal point for venture capital spending. 
</P>
<P>
	But other geographic regions are starting to attract more money  
as the large venture capital firms realize that Internet companies 
are sprouting up all over the country, Barry said, noting that 
one-third of the Internet companies that completed IPOs during the 
first six months of 1999 are located in the New York metropolitan 
area.

<HEADLINE> Tough New Contract for SNL Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When he was TV's biggest star in the 1950s,  
Milton Berle happily signed a 30-year exclusive contract with NBC. 
He lived to regret it. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, NBC is handing potential stars that it signs for ``Saturday  
Night Live'' a contract that could tie them to the network for as 
long as 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	According to The New York Observer, first-year cast members must  
now sign a contract that not only retains the performer's services 
for five or six years, but can then transfer the player from 
``SNL'' to an NBC sitcom -- for a potential contract extension of as 
much as six more years. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract also contains a three-film option, giving NBC and  
``SNL'' executive producer Lorne Michaels the right to place the 
player in a movie they produce under the SNL Films banner for a 
lower fee than a competing studio might offer, the Observer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like `SNL' puts a gun to your head and says you're  
auditioning,'' complained one agent who represents a comic. 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently the new strategy is NBC's way of holding onto the  
stars ``SNL'' creates, then often loses, going back to when John 
Belushi became a box office sensation with ``Animal House'' in the 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also a way to lock in the services of emerging new talent  
for NBC prime-time at a time when the network's ratings dominance 
is no longer a sure thing. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Michaels nor NBC West Coast president Scott Sassa would  
comment on the contract. But in the Observer story, Sassa insisted 
the new terms were only fair. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody who comes in and is, basically, virtually unknown and  
young has an opportunity to be on a very, very powerful 
sketch-comedy show and to be able to launch a film career and be in 
sitcoms,'' he said. ``I think that's a pretty good opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michaels told The Observer ``the idea that the whole culture of  
the place is changing is just idiotic. ... We've been very, as they 
say in Hollywood, talent-friendly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No new ``SNL'' players have been announced yet for the show's  
25th season, which begins Oct. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1951, NBC signed Berle to an unprecedented contract calling  
for $100,000 a year for 30 years -- whether he worked or not. But by 
1965, after Berle's star quality had faded, he got the network to 
let him work elsewhere, and Berle accepted a pay cut to $60,000 a 
year.

<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets closed higher Monday  
on the back of last week's rally on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average jumped  
390.86 points, or 2.24 percent, to close at 17,826.03. On Friday, 
the average finished up 12.20 points, or 0.07 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	International blue-chip stocks in Tokyo posted strong gains in  
line with a surge in share prices in the United States last week. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 184.26  
points Friday to close at 10,973.65. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's big blue chip stocks often rise in tandem with Wall  
Street because they do much of their business in the United States 
and their fates are closely linked to those of U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 114.84 yen in  
late-afternoon trading, down 0.08 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and 
below its late New York level of 115.74 yen Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong stocks rebounded strongly as fears eased of possible  
sharp increases in U.S. interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, rose 286.60 points, or 2.3 percent, to close at 
12,894.78. On Friday, the index had slumped 171.57 points, or 1.3 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said prices surged in reaction to a U.S. Labor  
Department report on Friday that suggested that inflation in the 
United States remains in check, easing investors' fears of sharp 
interest rate increases. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hong Kong market was also boosted by Friday's sharp rally on  
Wall Street.

<P>
	Share prices in Taiwan surged in reaction to last week's  
announcement that Morgan Stanley Capital International has decided 
to double Taiwan's weighting in its indexes beginning February 
2000. 
</P>

	The Taipei market's Weighted Stock Price Index rose 392.42  
points or 5.1 percent, to 8,018.47. 
</P>
<P>
	Dealers said investors were still busy with asset reallocation  
following last Thursday's news that MSCI has raised Taiwan's

<HEADLINE> Man Gets Prison, Fine for Polluting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A man portrayed by prosecutors as an  
incorrigible polluter has been sentenced to 13 years in prison for 
releasing millions of gallons of contaminants. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Richard Lazzara on Monday also ordered  
62-year-old Gary Benkovitz to pay a $14,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Benkovitz's company, Bay Drum and Steel Inc., cleans and resells  
55-gallon drums for commercial use. He and the company were charged 
with releasing more than 4 million gallons of contaminated water 
and more than 636,350 pounds of sludge as a result of the 
drum-washing operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Benkovitz pleaded guilty in March to illegally disposing of  
hazardous waste and knowingly discharging pollutants. That plea 
came after he was awaiting sentencing on a guilty plea to similar 
1997 charges involving another of his facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's shown a total lack of remorse, and worse than that, he  
has continued to damage the community,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney 
Teri Donaldson told the judge last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Benkovitz's lawyers argued that there was no evidence that their  
client's actions put the public at risk. Most of the contaminants 
filtered into the city's sanitary system, not into open bodies of 
water, they said.

<HEADLINE> Agency: Nichols Defense Too Pricey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- The head of the state agency that appoints  
public defenders told a judge Monday that the office does not have 
the money to adequately defend bombing conspirator Terry Nichols. 
</P>
<P>
	The Legislature appropriated $1 million to the Oklahoma Indigent  
Defense System last year for Nichols' defense on state murder 
charges. Jim Bednar, the agency's executive director, has said 
defending Nichols could cost up to $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, however, the Legislature withdrew $900,000 of the funds  
in Nichols' case and reallocated it to help victims of tornadoes 
that killed 44 people and destroyed thousands of homes that month. 
An attempt to restore the funds failed during a special session in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
	During a hearing on the agency's request to withdraw as Nichols'  
attorney, Bednar told Judge Robert M. Murphy Jr. that ``with the 
disapproval of that funding, we believe our appointment fails.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy responded that he has ``a hard time seeing'' the need to  
help tornado victims ``as a legitimate reason to withdraw the 
money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing was expected to last through the day and possibly  
continue on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols and Timothy McVeigh were convicted of federal charges in  
the April 19, 1995, bombing. McVeigh was sentenced to death for the 
bombing and the deaths of eight federal law enforcement officers. 
Nichols is serving life for conspiracy and involuntary manslaughter 
for those deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Oklahoma County District Attorney Bob Macy filed 160  
murder charges against Nichols and said he will seek the death 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Two months later, the Legislature redirected the $900,000 to  
tornado victims and reappropriated $300,000 that had been promised 
to Macy's office for Nichols' prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	State Sen. Cal Hobson testified that the money was withdrawn  
because lawmakers deemed a state trial unnecessary, since Nichols 
already is serving life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	But Murphy said it is not up to the Legislature to tell a  
prosecutor which cases to prosecute. 
</P>
<P>
	Macy opposes the agency's motion to withdraw from Nichols' case,  
saying the office has other resources it could use to pay for 
Nichols' defense. ``We are very concerned that he have competent 
counsel,'' Macy said.

<HEADLINE> MCI WorldCom To Atone for Outage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- MCI WorldCom Inc., having restored its data  
network to full power over the weekend after 10 days of service 
disruptions, is now trying to restore confidence among the 
thousands of businesses thrown offline by the outages. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, one of the world's biggest operators of Internet  
``backbone'' networks, said Monday it would provide 20 days of free 
service to about 3,000 customers, including major names such as 
America Online Inc., as well as smaller Internet service providers 
and other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear, however, whether that compensation would satisfy  
many clients who were unable to provide service to thousands of 
their own customers during the outages on one of four major MCI 
WorldCom networks. 
</P>
<P>
	The network began breaking down Aug. 5 after a software upgrade  
from Lucent Technologies, one of the three leading manufacturers of 
Internet and other networking equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	As various attempts to stabilize the network failed, the  
situation also became a public relations problem, similar to those 
faced recently by Internet brokers overwhelmed by huge trading 
volume or two years ago, when America Online couldn't handle floods 
of members trying a new unlimited usage plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``MCI WorldCom compounded the problem by the way they dealt with  
it,'' said Lisa Pierce, an industry analyst for Giga Information 
Group, asserting that ``the service credits they offered are an 
insult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bombarded by complaints it reacted too slowly and failed to keep  
customers updated, MCI WorldCom took the entire network out of 
service over the weekend to remove the new Lucent software. The old 
software was restored and the network was put back in service on 
Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	A Lucent spokeswoman said the software in question has been  
deployed successfully on other networks and suggested that the 
problem was caused by the installation process rather than the 
software itself. 
</P>
<P>
	The outages disrupted ATM cash machine networks and affected  
organizations as prominent as the Chicago Board of Trade, whose 
electronic trading system was idled. The exchange issued an angry 
statement criticizing MCI WorldCom's handling of the situation and 
suggested it might take its business elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	There was only a marginal impact at AOL, since the online  
company uses a multitude of communications carriers and networks to 
serve its 17 million-plus members. 
</P>
<P>
	But some MCI WorldCom clients and their customers were hit much  
harder. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a trickle-down situation,'' said Rick Daniluk, a  
spokesman for Mountain Computer Wizards of Buena Vista, Colo., 
which provides dial-up Internet access for 1,500 customers as well 
as other Web and data services for businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have to compensate our clients,'' said Daniluk,  
whose company's Internet traffic is carried by DX Net, an MCI 
WorldCom customer hit hard by the outages. ``We're going to go to 
DX Net for compensation. It amounts to more than our monthly fees 
we pay DX Net.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to Bernard J. Ebbers, MCI WorldCom president and chief  
executive, the refunds and compensation for lost network time will 
produce ``a very, very slight downtick in revenues,'' but the 
company is still comfortable with current Wall Street profit 
forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ebbers also said no customers have indicated they will switch to  
a different data carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	But even if most data clients stay with MCI WorldCom, some might  
decide to at least send some of their business elsewhere as a 
precaution against relying too much on any one carrier and getting 
stuck in a similar situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``A surprising number of companies don't have a backup  
alternative in case there are emergencies,'' said Pierce, noting 
that most businesses use only one data carrier to get a volume 
discount. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a tradeoff between savings and safety, and I think  
some customers are going to look at that again,'' Pierce said. 
``Ebbers said he doesn't expect it to hurt the bottom line very 
much. I doubt that he's right. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of MCI WorldCom closed down 25 cents to $78.43 3/4 in  
trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

<HEADLINE> Dolphins Say Underwood Off Waivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Jimmy Johnson hopes to persuade Dimitrius Underwood  
that there's room in his life for both religion and the Miami 
Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood, a first-round draft choice released last week by the  
Minnesota Vikings after he left them to pursue his faith, was 
claimed off waivers Monday by the Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson acknowledged that the 22-year-old defensive end may not  
want to join the Dolphins -- at least not right away. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it so happens he doesn't play for the Dolphins this year,  
we'll retain his rights for the future,'' Johnson said. ``We're 
going to let him have some time to talk about the opportunity here. 
Then we'll be getting with him in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one in the organization has talked to Underwood, Dolphins  
spokesman Harvey Greene said. Director of football operations Bob 
Ackles talked with Underwood's agent, Craig Domann, but details of 
the conversation weren't disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Domann didn't return a phone call seeking comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Underwood is Johnson's latest reclamation project, although the  
other cases are much different. The Dolphins' training camp roster 
includes three convicted felons and receiver Tony Martin, currently 
on trial on federal charges of laundering drug money. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami was awarded the rights to Underwood because no NFL team  
with a worse record last year claimed him. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins assume his five-year, $5.3 million contract, but  
they're not responsible for his $1.75 million signing bonus. His 
base salary for 1999 is less than $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said the Dolphins studied Underwood extensively before  
the April draft. They decided against picking him in the first 
round, and he was instead taken with the 29th choice by Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a very talented defensive end,'' Johnson said.  
</P>
<P>
	Underwood went AWOL after his first practice with the Vikings on  
Aug. 2, leaving his family, his agent and team officials to 
speculate about his motive and whereabouts. He said last week he 
would rejoin the Vikings but instead was released after agreeing to 
return about $543,000 in bonus money, most of which was frozen at 
his bank when he disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood explained his absence by saying he was torn between a  
desire to pursue the ministry and the need to support his family, 
including his 16-month-old twins who live in Michigan with his 
former girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	He sought spiritual guidance from defensive end-turned-minister  
Reggie White, who retired from the Green Bay Packers last winter. 
White encouraged Underwood to return to football. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood sat out the 1998 season at Michigan State with a  
sprained ankle. He had eight sacks as a junior.

<HEADLINE> Houston Astros Activate Caminiti </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- After nearly three months on the disabled list,  
Ken Caminiti was activated Monday by the Houston Astros. 
</P>
<P>
	The third baseman, who had a strained right calf, went 7-for-20  
in a six-game rehabilitation assignment with Triple-A New Orleans. 
He started Monday night's game again Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	``The calf is great, everything else hurts,'' Caminiti said.  
``The calf gets a little sore about the fourth or fifth inning, but 
I can run on it. I think it's healthy enough not to cramp up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Caminiti, the 1996 National League MVP, was hitting .292 with  
two homers and 17 RBIs in 36 games with the Astros this season. He 
went on the disabled list on May 21. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sitting is not my nature,'' he said. ``I went away at the  
right time, when they were doing good. I came back at the right 
time, with them in a little rut right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Houston had lost five of six going into Monday's series opener.  
</P>
<P>
	``I am cautiously optimistic but only one week in New Orleans is  
like taking six weeks of spring training and condensing it into a 
week,'' Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker said. ``We've got to 
understand he's had a limited rehab and we're going to proceed very 
cautiously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Caminiti plays himself into shape, Bill Spiers will still  
get some playing time at third base. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know my role on this team so I don't get the least bit  
concerned,'' Spiers said. ``I will find a way to contribute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Caminiti is known for his gutsy and acrobatic play at third base  
but Hunsicker hopes fans don't expect him to be in top form right 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure a lot of people have high expectations and they are  
unrealistic,'' Hunsicker said. ``I do think if he can stay healthy, 
he'll be a key addition for us over the next six weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Caminiti definitely will add a spark.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone has really missed Camy because he's really a gamer,''  
pitcher Scott Elarton said. ``He's not always 100 percent but he 
always give 110 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To make room for Caminiti, the Astros optioned infielder Russ  
Johnson back to New Orleans.

	Columbine Students Return To School  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Students at Columbine High returned for  
the start of the school year today, four months after two gunmen 
sent them fleeing in horror. On April 20, students Dylan Klebold 
and Eric Harris killed 12 classmates and a teacher and wounded 23 
people before committing suicide. In classrooms today, teachers 
reminded students that counseling is available. Two mental health 
experts have been added to the staff. The Jefferson County School 
District spent $1.2 million to transform the inside of Columbine 
from a scene of carnage back into a place of learning.

	Alexander Quits, But Doesn't Endorse

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lamar Alexander did not endorse any of his  
Republican rivals today as he announced he was abandoning his bid 
for the White House. But Alexander suggested Texas Gov. George W. 
Bush was inexperienced for the job of president. In Texas, Bush 
issued a statement calling Alexander ``a good man who poured his 
heart into his campaign.'' Bush is expected to pick up most of 
Alexander's fund-raising team. Alexander, the former Tennessee 
governor, was the first in a crowded Republican field to drop out 
after finishing sixth in Saturday's Iowa straw vote.

	BOTLIKH, Russia (AP) -- Russian fighter jets roared over the  
Caucasus region of Dagestan today, pressing ahead with a bombing 
campaign against Islamic militants holed up in several mountain 
villages. Still reluctant to launch a large ground offensive, 
Moscow was relying on air power and heavy artillery against the 
entrenched rebels. The fighting began Aug. 7, when rebels crossed 
from Chechnya into Dagestan and seized several villages. Meanwhile, 
ex-KGB agent Vladimir Putin won confirmation today as Russia's 
fifth prime minister since early last year. Putin told parliament 
he would crack down on Islamic militants in the Caucasus Mountains

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Clowns and magicians were on hand today along  
with guards and police officers as children returned to the Jewish 
community center where a white supremacist went on a shooting 
rampage last week. Many of the youngsters arrived with bright green 
and purple hair for ``crazy hair day,'' aimed at creating an 
atmosphere of fun for the reopening of day camp at the North Valley 
Jewish Community Center. More than 160 children attended camp today 
and only five were absent. On Aug. 10, Buford O. Furrow Jr. 
allegedly fired 70 shots and wounded a 68-year-old receptionist, a 
16-year-old counselor and three boys.

	HP's Quarterly Profits Rise

<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Hewlett-Packard Co., pushing to  
revitalize itself with a recent split and a new chief executive, 
reported a 37 percent rise in quarterly profit that beat Wall 
Street forecasts. HP, the world's second largest computer company, 
said today it earned $853 million,in the fiscal third quarter, up 
from a profit of $621 million in the same period last year. In 
March, HP split into two separate ventures -- a computer and imaging 
business, and a testing and measurement business dubbed Agilent 
Technologies -- in an effort to revitalize underperforming divisions 
and improve sagging profits.

	Ford To Test Hydrogen-Powered Engine

<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. said today that  
researchers later this year plan to begin road-testing a 
hydrogen-powered internal combustion engine that promises up to 30 
percent better fuel efficiency. Fuel cells produce electricity from 
an electrochemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen; the only 
emission is water. Automakers are spending hundreds of millions of 
dollars on fuel-cell research as government pressure for 
zero-emission vehicles increases, but few experts expect them to 
become commercially viable within the next decade.

average rose 73.14 to close at 11,046.79, the index's first close 
above 11,000 since July 21. Declining issues on the New York Stock 
Exchange led advancers 1,553-1,425. The Nasdaq rose 7.47 to

	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- San Antonio Spurs star Sean Elliott was in  
stable condition today after undergoing a kidney transplant, 
receiving a healthy organ from his brother, Noel. Doctors have said 
it will take two to three months before they'll know whether 
Elliott could try to continue to play basketball, but he has said 
he hopes to return to the game. Elliott needed a transplant because 
of a condition that slows the kidneys, preventing them from 
properly filtering waste from the blood.

<P>
	Bubby Brister is the Denver Broncos starting quarterback but  
Brian Griese made a strong case for the job on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Griese, who played about half of Denver's 38-7 preseason rout of  
the Arizona Cardinals, completed 18 of 21 passes for 192 yards and 
two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brian showed a lot of poise and made some good decisions,''  
said Broncos coach Mike Shanahan. ``He never seemed to get rattled. 
He was reading the break on his receivers and made a number of 
great throws.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona got its lone score late in the third quarter, closing to  
17-7 on Michael Pittman's 2-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Broncos responded with three fourth-quarter touchdowns --  
Griese's 13-yard pass to Byron Chamberlain, rookie Olandis Gary's 
1-yard run and cornerback Tito Paul's 67-yard interception return. 
</P>
<P>
	In other preseason games Saturday night, it was Tampa Bay 30,  
Cleveland 3; Green Bay 27, New York Jets 16; Buffalo 24, Seattle 
10; and Indianapolis 20, Cincinnati 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas played at Oakland and Tennessee was at Kansas City on  
Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Brister, rebounding from a lackluster performance in the  
Broncos' exhibition opener, was 8-of-10 for 93 yards. Terrell Davis 
left the game late in the first period after carrying six times for 
43 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-time defending Super Bowl champion Broncos dominated in  
almost every phase of the game, outgaining Arizona 448 yards to 
161. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know one phase of our football team that I was pleased  
with,'' Arizona coach Vince Tobin said. ``We were outplayed in 
almost every area. We stepped up in class to play the world 
champions, and we didn't meet force with force. I don't think I've 
ever seen a team beaten as consistently as we were on defense 
tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
                       *Buccaneers 30, Browns 3    	
</P>
<P>
	Trent Dilfer completed 7 of 10 passes for 122 yards, including a  
45-yard TD to Jacquez Green to lift Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Backups Eric Zeier and Shaun King each led two scoring drives as  
the Bucs outgained the Browns 386 yards to 58. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland No. 1 draft pick, Tim Couch, played like a rookie  
after an impressive debut in the Browns' victory over Dallas in the 
Hall of Fame game. In six series, he was unable to lead the team to 
a first down, finishing 5-of-12 passing for 27 yards. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Packers 27, Jets 16    	
</P>
<P>
	Matt Hasselbeck, a second-year quarterback who spent last season  
on the Green Bay's practice squad, threw two touchdown passes in 
the second half to lead the Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	Packers reserves earned the victory, but New York's starters  
outplayed Green Bay in the first half. The Green Bay offense was 
inconsistent under Brett Favre and Rick Mirer, while Jets 
quarterback Vinny Testaverde directed two sharp scoring drives. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Bills 24, Seahawks 10    	
</P>
<P>
	Manny Martin returned an interception 96 yards for a touchdown  
as Buffalo spoiled Mike Holmgren's debut as Seattle's coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo's third-string quarterback, Alex Van Pelt, hit Jeremy  
McDaniel for an 11-yard touchdown pass in the fourth quarter to put 
the game out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Colts 20, Bengals 17    	
</P>
<P>
	Peyton Manning was 12-of-16 for 137 yards, including a  
31-touchdown pass to Marvin Harrison, and the Colts won on a late 
26-yard field goal from Mike Vanderjagt. 
</P>
<P>
	Vanderjagt broke a 17-all tie with three seconds left in the  
game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colts played without rookie running back Edgerrin James, who  
signed two days earlier and was watching from the sideline. 
Indianapolis managed just 34 yards on the ground without James. 
</P>
<P>
                          *Sunday's Games    	
</P>
<P>
                        *Raiders 10, Cowboys 3    	
</P>
<P>
	Backup quarterback Scott Dreisbach led Oakland for most of a  
10-play, 77-yard drive that led to the winning score before he 
broke his leg in the Raiders' win. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyrone Wheatley capped the drive with a 1-yard plunge with 35  
seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Dreisbach was tackled while trying to get to the sideline on a  
bootleg with 1:45 left. He landed on his right leg at the Dallas 5, 
grimacing in pain before being taken off the field on a cart.

	Titans quarterback Steve McNair was 6-of-11 for 66 yards with an  
interception. Neil O'Donnell, who may unseat him as the starter,

<HEADLINE> Columbus, Ohio, Acts on Police Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- The city has reached a tentative agreement  
with the U.S. Justice Department to resolve allegations of police 
abuse, possibly avoiding a federal civil rights lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	A Justice Department review of more than 300 complaints found  
that Columbus police officers engaged in a pattern of violations, 
including use of excessive force, false arrests and illegal 
searches. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement would be one of just a few in the country between  
a city and the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, and is 
notable because the alleged pattern of misconduct is not 
race-related. 
</P>
<P>
	City officials on Monday said the proposed agreement, which  
includes a call for an independent monitor and increased training, 
needs approval from the Fraternal Order of Police because of union 
contract changes that would be required. The union expects to 
review it in the next 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division told  
the city it was prepared to file a lawsuit, but would wait to see 
if the city took steps to correct the problems.

<HEADLINE> Nebraskan Soccer Team Visits Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- An under-17 soccer team from Nebraska brought the  
American heartland to Cuba on Monday in the countries' first 
amateur sports exchange since Washington announced its intention to 
improve relations through ``people to people'' encounters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gold Nemesis, Nebraska's top under-17 soccer club, tied 2-2  
against Cuba's national high school level team in the first of four 
matches. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides expressed hope such exchanges would help improve ties  
between the countries, which haven't had diplomatic relations in 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think sports is a great way to break barriers. The language  
can separate you, but through soccer you can speak your own 
language,'' said Zach Wells, 17, one of three Gold Nemesis 
captains. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nebraskans are the first amateur team to visit Cuba since  
President Clinton announced in January that he hoped to increase 
sports and cultural exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	The 21 members of the four-time state champions arrived  
Saturday, in the middle of a three-day visit by U.S. Senate 
Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota and his Democratic 
colleague, Sen. Byron Dorgan of North Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	Luis Hernandez, president of the Cuban Soccer Association, said  
the two visits marked progress in improving U.S.-Cuba relations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they are steps toward greater closeness. The people of  
Cuba greatly admire the people of the United States and I think it 
is vice versa as well,'' Hernandez said while watching Monday's 
match. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nebraskans, who raised $24,000 to make the week long trip,  
presented two Cuban amateur teams with jerseys donated by Reebok 
and the Italian company Diadora. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban players promptly put on their new jerseys to play the  
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament follows Cuban criticism of the Pan Am Games in  
Winnipeg, Manitoba, where Cuban athletes said they were harassed by 
U.S. athletic scouts who encouraged defections from the communist 
island. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was no animosity expressed against the Nebraskans, who  
said they have only received positive greetings in Cuba. The crowd 
of about 300 at Monday's game, including many ``soccer moms and 
dads'' from Nebraska, offered enthusiastic support for the teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite Cuba's problems in Winnipeg, we don't have any hard  
feelings against anyone,'' said Michael Galinda, 18, a member of 
Havana's champion selection team. ``We wish to give them a big 
welcome for this, which is so beautiful.''

<HEADLINE> Dole Considers Straw Poll a Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole had money on her mind  
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the average wage earner is working five months to pay the  
government, there's something wrong,'' she told workers at 
RealWorld Corp., an accounting software company. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just can't wait to get the IRS out of your pockets and out  
of your lives,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole promised to release a comprehensive tax reform plan this  
fall that she said would rein in the Internal Revenue Service and 
eliminate the marriage and federal estate taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	She also talked about her own finances.  
</P>
<P>
	Dole said she considers finishing third in the Iowa Straw Poll,  
behind Texas Gov. George W. Bush and publisher Steve Forbes, a 
victory because she spent only $250,000, while they spent millions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll demonstrate that the candidate with the most experience  
is more qualified than the candidates with the most money,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Dukes, 32, director of product management at RealWorld,  
said he thinks Dole can build the support she needs to close the 
gap with Bush. ``She's very straightforward,'' he said. ``She gives 
her position and doesn't put her finger up in the air before giving 
an opinion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, speaking to Manchester Rotarians at a local restaurant,  
Dole called for a strengthening of the country's schools and 
traditional values. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole said the key is to increase local control of schools, give  
teachers the power to remove troublemakers from their classes and 
involve parents in their children's education. 
</P>
<P>
	Debby Curran, who lives and teaches in Amherst, listened to Dole  
while waiting tables. She was impressed, but didn't think much of 
Dole's education platforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Curran said her parents are involved and she already has the  
authority to remove rowdy students.

<HEADLINE> Lutherans To Vote on Church Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Leaders of the nation's largest Lutheran  
denomination vote this week on whether to form an alliance with the 
Episcopal Church that could mean fundamental changes in the way the 
Lutherans ordain their clergy. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the pact, the Episcopal Church and the Evangelical  
Lutheran Church in America would recognize and share each other's 
sacraments and clergy and cooperate in missionary projects. 
Together, they have about 7.5 million members. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike similar pacts the Lutheran group has with three other  
denominations, this agreement -- already supported by the Episcopal 
Church -- requires the Lutherans to follow an ordination practice 
known as the historic episcopate: Each bishop is installed by a 
laying on of hands by three predecessor bishops from a line 
believed to extend back to Christ's apostles. 
</P>
<P>
	That has raised opposition within the Lutheran ranks.  
</P>
<P>
	When the Lutheran delegates voted two years ago on a similar  
pact with the Episcopal Church, it was narrowly rejected. During 
the same convention, the delegates approved pacts with the 
Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), Reformed Church in America and United 
Church of Christ -- none of which required changes in Lutheran 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
	The Episcopal Church has said for over a century that its full  
recognition of other churches depends on their having the historic 
episcopate. 
</P>
<P>
	It has agreed to suspend the rule to recognize current Lutheran  
clergy. However, future Lutheran ordinations would have to be done 
the Episcopal way. 
</P>
<P>
	Lutheran teachings don't require such historic succession, and  
many of the world's Lutheran bodies do not practice it. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, 1,039 Lutheran convention delegates -- clergy and  
laity -- are expected to vote on the pact during a national 
convention that started Monday in Denver. If the Lutherans approve 
it, Episcopalians will act on it during their convention in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will be very close,'' said H. George Anderson, the  
Lutherans' presiding bishop. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1997 vote was six votes shy of the two-thirds majority  
necessary for approval. But according to a tally by the Rev. 
Bradley Jenson of Duluth, Minn., nearly half of Lutherans voting at 
regional meetings earlier this year said they opposed the Episcopal 
pact. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Daniel W. Perry, the ecumenical officer for the  
Episcopalians, said the pact would help both denominations because 
they could share clergy and mission work in urban and rural areas 
where their resources are spread thin.

<HEADLINE> New Duet CD by Rondstadt, Harris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Decades of friendship and respect have gone  
into the new duet CD by Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	``She just blew me away,'' Ronstadt said in recalling the time  
more than 20 years ago that she first saw Harris sing. ``It was a 
time where I had to say I can either let this make me feel really 
terrible ... or I could accept it as really great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris said she was equally intimidated back then by Ronstadt.  
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I was pretty good,'' she said. ``But when I heard  
Linda do this a capella thing, I thought that no voice could be 
that beautiful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, who joins with Ronstadt on ``Western Wall: The Tucson  
Sessions,'' also credits her for helping land a record contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The two have joined forces previously to record ``Trio'' and  
``Trio II'' with Dolly Parton. The new CD marks their first 
Ronstadt-Harris effort.

<HEADLINE> Glaucoma Blindness Blocker Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists have discovered a possible new way  
to slow, if not prevent, the blindness caused by glaucoma: Fighting 
a chemical called nitric oxide. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, it has worked only in rats, scientists caution. But the  
research is so promising that its discoverers already are talking 
with pharmaceutical companies about creating a drug glaucoma 
patients could one day use. 
</P>
<P>
	The work ``will likely be considered classic in years to come,''  
University of Wisconsin ophthalmologist Paul Kaufman declared in 
reviewing the research, published in this week's Proceedings of the 
National Academy of Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	Glaucoma is the second leading cause of irreversible vision loss  
in the United States, and the most common cause among black 
Americans. An estimated 3 million Americans have glaucoma, and 
120,000 are blind as a result. 
</P>
<P>
	In glaucoma, pressure inside the eyeball increases to high  
levels because eye fluid doesn't drain properly. Eventually, that 
pressure damages the optic nerve and progressively eats away 
vision. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, all treatment has been aimed at easing that pressure,  
either with medicated eye drops or surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``even with very effective lowering, there are a significant  
number of people who continue to lose vision,'' said Dr. Carl 
Kupfer, director of the National Eye Institute. ``The exciting 
thing about ... (the new discovery) is that it represents an 
entirely new and different way'' of fighting glaucoma. 
</P>
<P>
	Ophthalmology professor Arthur Neufeld of Washington University  
School of Medicine in St. Louis knew other scientists had 
discovered that excessive levels of a body chemical called nitric 
oxide can be toxic to certain tissues. 
</P>
<P>
	What if nitric oxide, Neufeld wondered, also was toxic to eye  
tissue? 
</P>
<P>
	That question led off a chain of discoveries.  
</P>
<P>
	First, Neufeld examined human eye tissue from glaucoma patients,  
and discovered an enzyme called NOS-2 that makes excessive -- 
destructive -- amounts of nitric oxide. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew that nitric oxide must be at very high levels'' in  
patients' eyes, Neufeld said. 
</P>
<P>
	But did it cause the glaucoma, or was it merely a byproduct of  
dying cells in the retina? 
</P>
<P>
	So Neufeld turned to an animal model of glaucoma, clogging up  
rats' eyes until their optic pressure built enough to begin 
destroying their sight. Sure enough, their eyes harbored NOS-2, 
also. 
</P>
<P>
	Neufeld never treated the pressure in any of the rats' eyes.  
Instead, he put into some of the rats' drinking water an 
experimental drug called aminoguanidine that can inhibit NOS-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Six months later, the rats who didn't drink any medicine had  
lost 36 percent of their retinal cells -- but the medicated rats had 
lost less than 10 percent of those crucial vision cells, even 
though their eye pressure had never been lowered. 
</P>
<P>
	``By blocking the nitric oxide, we protected the optic nerve,''  
Neufeld explained. 
</P>
<P>
	That suggests both that nitric oxide buildup is a cause of  
glaucoma, and that lowering the chemical might prove an important 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	There are no nitric oxide-lowering drugs sold today, Neufeld  
cautioned, and it will take at least five years to test 
experimental glaucoma drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the experimental medicine Neufeld fed rats, developing a  
nitric oxide-blocking eyedrop would be better for people, Kupfer 
said. That way, it could be tested in just one eye of each patient 
-- so if potential drugs fail or prove harmful, the other eye would 
be untouched. 
</P>
<P>
	Because nitric oxide is a target in other diseases,  
pharmaceutical companies already were hotly researching nitric 
oxide blockers, and Neufeld said he's already in discussions about 
creating a glaucoma drug.

<HEADLINE> Khristich Fets $2.8M From Arbitrator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- An arbitrator ruled Monday that the Boston Bruins  
will have to pay forward Dmitri Khristich $2.8 million, a raise of 
$850,000, if they want to keep him next season. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Bruins elect not to pay Khristich, he will become a free  
agent. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old left wing from Kiev, Ukraine, scored 29 goals  
and had 41 assists last season. In 12 playoff games, he had three 
goals and four assists. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bruins submitted a figure of $1.95 million to arbitration,  
which is what Khristich made last season, while he asked for $3.5 
million, according to WBZ-AM in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Bruins would not discuss what was offered and  
asked, a spokeswoman confirmed the arbitrator's award and said it 
``basically came down in the middle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team has 72 hours to make its decision.  
</P>
<P>
	Khristich has scored 225 goals with 282 assists for a total of  
507 points in nine NHL seasons.

<HEADLINE> Marlin Prospect To Start Vs. L.A. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Florida Marlins top pitching prospect A.J. Burnett,  
who has struggled this season in the minor leagues, will make his 
major-league debut Tuesday against the Los Angeles Dodgers and then 
return to Double-A Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if he pitches a no-hitter, he's going back down,''  
Marlins manager John Boles said. 
</P>
<P>
	Burnett will fill in for Alex Fernandez, who will miss one start  
after receiving a cortisone shot in his pitching shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	The 22-year-old Burnett is 6-11 with a 5.78 ERA at Portland,  
where he was demoted last week to the bullpen. But the Marlins say 
he has pitched better lately. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think he has a chance to pitch well,'' Marlins general  
manager Dave Dombrowski said. ``Maybe it will give him a shot in 
the arm. But there's nothing lost. I think he will handle it either 
way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burnett led the minor leagues with 186 strikeouts at Single-A  
Kane County last year and contended briefly this spring for a 
starting job with the Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
	At Portland he has allowed 122 hits and 70 walks with 119  
strikeouts in 113 2-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know you ask, `Why is a guy who is having a bad year being  
rewarded?''' Boles said. ``But he is still a top prospect. Top 
prospects are a priority. We're calling him up just to see him. I 
hope it will light a fire under him.''

<HEADLINE> Study Find More Graves Under Garbage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A potter's field that became a garbage dump  
contains more than twice as many bodies than the 18,000 originally 
thought, a new study says. 
</P>
<P>
	And it is possible the sliver of land in an industrial area near  
the airport and an Anheuser-Busch brewery could hold as many as 
200,000 bodies, according to the study by Malcolm Pirnie, a White 
Plains, N.Y., environmental engineering firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The city ordered the study as part of a court-ordered  
restoration of City Cemetery, where people without money to pay for 
a funeral were buried between 1869 and 1954. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometime after the last burial, the city began using the  
cemetery as an industrial storage yard, then as a public dump. Its 
condition was publicized last year when an 85-year-old Hackensack 
woman sued the city after learning that her father was buried there 
in 1921. 
</P>
<P>
	Newark officials have found no burial records, but the Malcolm  
Pirnie report says metal grave markers and perhaps tombstones are 
buried underneath the trash, and that it ``is reasonable to 
assume,'' that 39,000 to 40,000 people are buried at the 5.2-acre 
cemetery, and perhaps as many as 200,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Eugene Boesch, the archaeologist who conducted the study,  
recommended that ground-penetrating radar be used this fall to 
locate the graves. Boesch also suggested that the city plant grass 
and shrubbery, erect a monument to the dead and produce a booklet 
on the cemetery's history. 
</P>
<P>
	The restoration is expected to cost more than $1 million.

</P>
<P>
	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Paddy Devlin, a committed  
socialist who helped found Northern Ireland's largest Roman 
Catholic party, died Sunday after a lenghty hospitalization. He was 
74. 
</P>
<P>
	A tireless campaigner against sectarianism and violence, Devlin  
participated in Northern Ireland's first and only experiment in a 
joint Protestant-Catholic government. As minister for health and 
human services, he was the second highest ranking Catholic in that 
1974 administration. 
</P>
<P>
	That government soon collapsed, and the British government  
resumed ``direct rule'' from London, an arrangement that continues 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	As an idealistic member of the IRA, he served a three-year  
prison sentence starting in 1942 for membership in the group. He 
renounced violence in prison, and later became a fierce critic of 
the IRA campaign to destabilize Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1970, Devlin co-founded the moderate Social Democratic and  
Labor Party, which since has always won the most votes from the 
province's Catholic minority, but resigned in 1977 in protest that 
the party appealed too narrowly to Catholic interests at the 
expense of working-class Protestants. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1981, Devlin was forced to abandon his home in his native  
Catholic west Belfast after facing intimidation from IRA 
supporters, who were angered by his criticism of the IRA prison 
hunger strike at the time.

<P>
	CRESSKILL, N.J. (AP) -- Dezider Grunberger, a cancer researcher  
and professor emeritus at Columbia University College of Physicians 
and Surgeons, died Aug. 7 of colon cancer. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of his research focused on chemical carcinogens. Grunberger  
helped develop antitumor drugs derived from propolis, a waxy 
substance bees collect from tree buds that has long been used as a 
folk remedy for various ailments. 
</P>
<P>
	Grunberger was born in Kosice, then part of Czechoslovakia,  
where he earned a master's degree in inorganic chemistry and 
doctoral degrees in biochemistry. 
</P>
<P>
	He settled in the United States in 1968 and eventually became a  
professor of biochemistry and biophysics and deputy director of 
Columbia's Comprehensive Cancer Center.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lane Kirkland, who reunited the major U.S.  
unions during his presidency of the AFL-CIO from 1979 to 1995, died 
Saturday of lung cancer. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton called Kirkland ``one of the towering figures  
in the American labor movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born of southern aristocracy in Camden, S.C., and schooled in  
international relations at Georgetown University, Kirkland bucked 
the stereotypes of union leadership when he was elected AFL-CIO 
president in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	He appealed for reunification of the nation's largest and  
best-known unions under the AFL-CIO because, he said, ``all sinners 
belong in the church.'' By 1990 he had brought back the United Auto 
Workers, the Teamsters, the West Coast Longshoremen, Chemical 
Workers, Mine Workers and Locomotive Engineers. 
</P>
<P>
	The AFL-CIO under Kirkland reached out to workers in other  
countries where the trade union movement was suppressed, including 
Poland, South Africa, China, Cuba and Chile. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirkland was the heir to a long line of Southern cotton growers  
whose roots date back to the American Revolution. As a teen-ager, 
he enrolled in the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy and served as an 
officer during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife, Irena, five children, five  
grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

	ARCADIA, Fla. (AP) -- Jerome Irving Kleinerman, a pathologist and  
lung specialist who did extensive research on coal miners and on 
the effects of tobacco smoke on lungs, died in an auto accident on 
Aug. 6. He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
	Kleinerman, a former resident of Shaker Heights, Ohio, retired  
to Palm Beach Gardens fours years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	His research aided in the diagnosis of lung diseases for coal  
miners. He also helped develop national workplace health standards 
and drew attention to the need for health safeguards in mines and 
other industrial settings. 
</P>
<P>
	Kleinerman began in 1951 as a pathology researcher at Case  
Western Reserve University in Cleveland. He retired in 1995 as 
professor emeritus of pathology and environmental health sciences 
and chairman of the pathology department at the affiliated Metro 
Health Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	He was chairman of the pathology department at Mount Sinai  
School of Medicine in New York from 1978 to 1986, and was director 
of pathology at Mount Sinai Hospital.

</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Philip M. Klutznick, an innovative real estate  
developer, former secretary of the U.S. Commerce Department, 
philanthropist and Jewish activist, died Saturday. He was 92 and 
had suffered from Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	During World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt placed  
Klutznick in charge of building housing for defense workers in the 
nation's eastern half. He built Oak Ridge, Tenn., which played a 
major role in development of the atomic bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	He served as head of the federal Public Housing Authority, then  
moved to the Chicago area and developed suburbs and suburban 
shopping malls. 
</P>
<P>
	After anticipating the post-war exodus to the suburbs, Klutznick  
was one of the first developers to sense a new back-to-the-city 
mood in the 1970s. He moved back into Chicago with the completion 
of Water Tower Place, a 74-story shopping, office and residential 
complex on Chicago's Michigan Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there is anything I have learned at all,'' he once said,  
``it is that everything is temporary in this world, and there isn't 
much difference between peoples.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Klutznick had close ties with Adlai E. Stevenson, the former  
Illinois governor and two-time Democratic presidential candidate. 
He also served as an envoy to the United Nations under presidents 
Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy and Jimmy Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	He served briefly as Secretary of Commerce under Carter.  
</P>
<P>
	He was president of B'nai B'rith from 1953 to 1959 and president  
of the World Jewish Congress in the late 1970s.

<P>
	Schinasi studied under George Grosz at the Art Students League

halfback at Michigan State in 1938 and member of the National 
Football Foundation Hall of Fame, died Saturday. He was 82 and had 
heart trouble for several years. 
</P>
<P>
	Pingel lived in Grosse Pointe Woods, Mich., and Juno Beach, Fla.  
The Michigan Sports Hall of Famer was best known as a halfback. He 
led the Spartans to their first bowl game, a 6-0 loss to Auburn in 
the Orange Bowl on Jan. 1, 1938. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a first-round draft pick of the Detroit Lions in 1939 and  
was with the team one season before World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	He served in the Army, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel.  
He entered the advertising business after the war, becoming 
president of Ross Roy in 1962 and chief executive and vice chairman 
in 1980. He retired in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	President Gerald Ford, who played football at rival Michigan,  
appointed Pingel to the President's Council on Physical Fitness.

</P>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Pee Wee Reese, the Hall of Fame shortstop  
and Brooklyn Dodgers captain who smoothed Jackie Robinson's entry 
into major league baseball as its first black player, died 
Saturday. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Reese, who overcame prostate cancer years ago, underwent  
radiation treatment for lung cancer in March 1997 after doctors 
removed a malignant tumor. He also was recovering from a broken hip 
at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	An eight-time All-Star, Reese led the Dodgers to seven National  
League pennants and helped Brooklyn win its only World Series 
championship in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicknamed ``The Little Colonel,'' he batted .269 in a career  
that spanned 1940-58 and included the Dodgers' first year in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	But his offensive career totals -- 126 home runs, 885 RBIs -- did  
not begin to measure the value of Harold Henry Reese to the 
Dodgers, or to baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Known for his calm leadership, sure-handed fielding and clutch  
hits, Reese played a key role in easing Robinson's road into the 
majors in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
	During one particularly tough time when the abuse was getting  
ugly at Crosley Field in Cincinnati, Reese walked over and put his 
arm over the rookie's shoulder, a show of unity from a white to a 
black that spoke volumes. 
</P>
<P>
	That moment is cited as a turning point in Robinson's  
transition. Later, Reese and Robinson would play golf and tennis 
together on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	In his 1972 book ``The Boys of Summer,'' author Roger Kahn  
hailed Reese as a ``catalyst of baseball integration'' for his 
friendship with Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were times when I went over to talk to him on the field,  
thinking that people would see this and figure we were friends and 
this would help Jack,'' Reese told Kahn. 
</P>
<P>
	Reese was inducted into baseball's Hall of Fame in 1984.  
</P>
<P>
	After his baseball career, Reese worked as a broadcaster with  
CBS, NBC and the Cincinnati Reds. He later became director of the 
college and professional baseball staff at Hillerich &AMP; Bradsby, 
maker of Louisville Slugger bats.

<P>
	Robinson, of Calumet City, Ill., grew up in Greenville, S.C.,  
moved to Chicago in 1976 and worked in restaurant management. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson praised Robinson for his activism in the Rainbow/Push  
Coalition, where he worked on voter registration drives. 
</P>
<P>
	``He never stopped fighting to make America better,'' Jackson  
said.

<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Celestine Sibley, the journalist and author of  
homespun columns on everything from gardening to politics, died 
Sunday. She was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Sibley was the author of 25 books, but she was best known  
for the folksy columns she wrote for The Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution for more than 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Her first newspaper job, while still in high school, was with  
The Mobile (Ala.) Press. She was a reporter with the Pensacola 
(Fla.) News Journal from 1936-41. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1941 she moved to Atlanta, where her journalist husband  
suggested she seek work with The Atlanta Journal or The Atlanta 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	She took a job at the Constitution for $35 a week, covering  
everything from murder trials to the state Legislature to the death 
of Margaret Mitchell, the author of ``Gone With The Wind.'' In 
1945, she began writing columns. 
</P>
<P>
	She is survived by two daughters, a son and nine grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Site of L.A. Shooting Reopens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Six-year-old Scott Pincus was a little  
worried about returning to the Jewish community center where a 
gunman shot five people, including his two best friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``First, he said the camp was bad. I told him it wasn't the camp  
that was bad, it was the person who did this,'' said his mother, 
Leslie Pincus. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid tight security Monday, more than 160 children returned to  
the North Valley Jewish Community Center for the first time since 
the Aug. 10 shooting. Only five were absent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bullet holes were patched and the shattered glass replaced. The  
only evidence of the rampage -- memories of a ``monster'' who fired 
70 bullets in the center's lobby. 
</P>
<P>
	``To the best of our ability, there is no evidence of the  
carnage that occurred here last Tuesday. We're making it as normal 
as possible,'' said Jeffrey Rouss, executive vice president of the 
12 Jewish Community Centers of Greater Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged gunman, Buford O. Furrow Jr., was charged with  
murder and attempted murder after surrendering to the FBI in Las 
Vegas. After the rampage at the community center, police say Furrow 
shot and killed postal carrier Joseph Ileto a few miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of a ``monster,'' as the gunman is referred to by the  
children and staff, the youngsters were met Monday by a clown, a 
magician and a contingent of police and security. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him to have a good day and that I would be back to get  
him this afternoon,'' Mrs. Pincus said after dropping off her son 
at the center's day camp. 
</P>
<P>
	The sounds of children at play, screams and laughter, could be  
heard from the street. Many appeared in good spirits, smiling and 
waving at the media. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to day camp,'' 5-year-old Rachel Blaisch yelled out  
the window as she was driven to the center. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the children arrived with bright green and purple hair  
for ``crazy hair day,'' which was aimed at bringing an atmosphere 
of fun to the reopening. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten grief counselors from the Jewish Family Services were on  
hand to help children and parents cope with returning to the 
center, which is located in the middle-class suburban neighborhood 
of Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of like reclaiming their home for them,'' said Sally  
Weber of Jewish Family Services. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Jesse Jackson also paid a visit.  
</P>
<P>
	``We saw two children with casts on their legs who'd been shot.  
We saw rabbis praying with congregants. We saw parents hugging 
children,'' Jackson said. ``We saw a community turning pain into 
power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only shooting victim still hospitalized, 5-year-old Benjamin  
Kadish, was in serious condition.

<HEADLINE> Time Warner Names Ames Music Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Time Warner Inc. named Roger Ames as head of the  
media giant's Warner Music Group, filling the second half of a hole 
left when the two leaders of its movie, television and music 
division announced their resignations last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Ames, a member of the senior management group of Warner Music  
International, has an extensive background in the music industry, 
dating back to 1975. He joined Warner Music International in April, 
after leaving The PolyGram Music Group, where he had served as 
president since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Ames is taking over some of the responsibilities held by  
departing chiefs Terry Semel and Bob Daly, who worked together 
running Warner Music Group and the company's studio operations. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 2, Time Warner announced that Barry Meyer had been  
selected to run the studio operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Roger Ames has the perfect blend of artistic sensitivity,  
executive know-how and financial understanding to run Warner Music 
Group. He's worked in the United States and abroad, as both an 
entrepreneur and within a corporate setting, and won the respect of 
colleagues and competitors alike,'' Time Warner chairman Gerald 
Levin said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Ames will begin his new post Oct. 4 and report to Time Warner  
president Richard Parsons. 
</P>
<P>
	Entertainment industry analysts said the timing of the  
appointments was a coincidence and not a sign that the company is 
in the midst of any significant changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very complicated and well-run company,'' said Marvin  
Roffman, president of Roffman Miller Associates, a Philadelphia 
money management firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, he said, ``it's musical chairs when it comes to  
management changes'' at large corporations.

<HEADLINE> Adviser: Dolphins' Martin Warned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Miami Dolphins receiver Tony Martin ignored a  
warning from his father to stay away from a longtime friend who had 
narcotics ties, saying it was none of his business, Martin's former 
financial adviser testified Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Norton, a San Diego-based financial planner, said he was at  
Martin's Southern California home when Hal Martin tried to warn his 
son. The elder Martin said he didn't think his son should associate 
with Rickey Brownlee, Norton testified. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know that drugs specifically came up,'' he said. ``But  
the implication was that Rickey Brownlee was a drug dealer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what Martin's response was, Norton said: ``That he  
basically didn't care what he did for a living.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin is being tried alongside Brownlee, a previously convicted  
drug dealer, in a case largely focusing on Brownlee's alleged drug 
activities from 1995-97. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin is charged with five counts of money laundering. He is  
accused of leasing three cars in his name on behalf of Brownlee, 
who paid him back with cash. Martin also is accused of writing a 
check to Brownlee's first lawyer in exchange for cash. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is whether Martin, who has known Brownlee since  
childhood and calls him his uncle, knew he was accepting drug 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	Norton testified that Martin, despite earning millions from  
playing professional football, has been heavily in debt since they 
first met while Martin was playing for the San Diego Chargers. 
Norton himself loaned Martin more than $100,000 during their 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	And yet, he said, Martin paid some $29,000 in cash to lease a  
Mercedes 500 SL for Brownlee in May 1996. Norton, who was 
responsible for paying Martin's bills, said he didn't learn of the 
deal until hearing from a leasing agent about an overdue payment. 
</P>
<P>
	Another time, he said, Martin called and ordered him to write a  
check to Brownlee for $46,673.05, saying the money would be 
reimbursed within a day or two. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of what had been portrayed as Rickey Brownlee's  
occupation, I was worried that would be money laundering,'' Norton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin later called to say the money wasn't needed, and the  
check was voided, Norton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys, pointing to a memo in which Norton voiced his  
objection to a recording studio deal that later failed, asked 
Norton if he ever told Martin he disapproved of his friendship with 
Brownlee. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's more of an internal matter,'' Norton said. ``Writing  
him a letter to that effect, I didn't think that was my 
discretion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors also played a March 1998 tape Norton made of a phone  
conversation with Martin, in which the player said he needed a 
$100,000 check to pay a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm writing a check for this lawyer, but I'm going to send  
cash to you so you can put it in the account,'' Martin said on the 
tape. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin called the next day to say he had $175,000 in cash,  
Norton testified, and that he was going to fly to California to 
deliver it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in shock,'' Norton said. ``I said, `I hope you don't get  
mugged.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Martin stopped payment on the check after  
federal investigators subpoenaed his financial records. He repaid 
Brownlee with two cashier's checks, an IRS agent testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Brownlee spent seven years in prison for 1980s drug convictions.  
Known on the streets as ``the Mayor of Opa-locka,'' he is charged 
with five counts of possessing heroin or cocaine with the intent to 
distribute, and one count of conspiracy to possess and distribute. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers spent the afternoon hammering at Norton's  
credibility. Martin attorney Howard Srebnick outlined a series of 
checks worth $137,500 from Martin's account to Norton or his firm 
that made no mention of why they were written. 
</P>
<P>
	Srebnick also questioned two agreements Martin signed in which  
Norton's description of the deal differed from what was in writing. 
One stipulated Norton would receive a $350 hourly fee in addition 
to 10 percent of Martin's earnings. Norton testified he charged 
only the 10 percent commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The other was an agreement that used Martin's home as collateral  
on a loan. The document said Martin would receive $330,000 in the 
deal, but Norton testified that it was for money previously loaned. 
</P>
<P>
	``You had Tony sign a deal that didn't reflect the agreement,''  
Srebnick said. ``It makes no sense in this transaction. It only 
does if you're around to explain it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norton has been investigated by California's attorney general  
and is a central figure in at least two other business 
controversies there.

<HEADLINE> AOL Teams With EMusic.com </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DULLES, Va. (AP) -- America Online Inc. has reached a three-year  
deal with Internet music service EMusic.com that will allow online 
visitors to buy and download music from three Web sites owned by 
AOL. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, EMusic's 20,000-song collection will be  
available on AOL's Spinner.com and Winamp.com, as well as ICQ.com, 
a chat service. EMusic will develop co-branded sites for the three 
services, selling music in the MP3 format. 
</P>
<P>
	EMusic, based in Redwood City, Calif., will pay AOL a fixed  
marketing fee and a share of transaction revenue. The company sells 
albums for $8.99 and individual songs for 99 cents. The company's 
catalog includes alternative, blues, hip-hop, jazz, pop, punk, 
techno and Indie rock music. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, AOL acquired Spinner.com, the Internet's  
largest music service, and Nullsoft, which makes the music player 
Winamp, in a deal worth $400 million in stock. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL, based in Dulles, Va., is a leading Internet provider with  
more than 17 million members. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of EMusic soared on news of the deal, rising $2.62 1/2 to  
$17.75 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Shares of AOL were trading at 
$96.12 1/2, down 75 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Lutherans To Vote on Church Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- As a national assembly of the Evangelical Lutheran  
Church in America began, leaders admitted anxiety over the 
meeting's overriding issue, a proposal for close unity -- but not 
full merger -- with the Episcopal Church. 
</P>
<P>
	``I confess to you that as I look forward to this assembly I  
feel both fear and weakness,'' Presiding Bishop H. George Anderson 
said Monday during an opening communion service. ``Fear of boiling 
frustrations, of misunderstood arguments, of tempers out of 
control, of conflict that seems unresolvable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson's prepared text said some have talked about ``an  
ecumenical train wreck'' here, but he omitted that remark. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed pact, scheduled for a vote Thursday, the 5.2  
million Lutherans and 2.3 million Episcopalians would recognize and 
share each other's clergy and sacraments, cooperate in mission 
projects and make joint decisions on important issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Daniel Perry, the ecumenical officer for the  
Episcopalians, said the pact would help both denominations because 
they could share clergy and mission work in urban and rural areas 
where their resources are spread thin. 
</P>
<P>
	The pact needs two-thirds approval from the 1,039 delegates. Two  
years ago, the Episcopal Church gave overwhelming approval but the 
Lutheran assembly's vote fell just short of two-thirds. The pact 
has been slightly reworked since. 
</P>
<P>
	The sticking point is that in the future Lutherans must follow  
the Episcopal practice known as the ``historic episcopate.'' Each 
Lutheran bishop will be installed by three predecessor bishops in a 
line believed to extend back to Christ's apostles, and all clergy 
will be ordained by such bishops. 
</P>
<P>
	Catholic and Orthodox churches, like the Episcopalians and  
Anglicans, follow this procedure. But Lutheran teaching does not 
require it and many Lutheran bodies, including those in the U.S., 
have never followed it. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours before the assembly opening, a meeting of Lutheran bishops  
shared worries about this week's deliberations and the aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
	Bishop Richard Foss of Fargo, N.D., a staunch foe, assured his  
colleagues that no schism will occur if the Episcopal pact passes. 
``There is zero chance of a breakaway church. That's just not on 
the table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But several of his colleagues warned there will be hard feelings  
among members whichever side wins. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a divided church on this issue,'' said Bishop Peter  
Rogness of Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1982, when the Lutherans and Episcopalians first declared  
a preliminary level of fellowship, the Episcopal Church has seen a 
net loss of 455,000 members, or 16 per cent. The Evangelical 
Lutheran Church in America has lost membership, too, but far less 
drastically.

<HEADLINE> Waste Management Ousts No. 2 Exec </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Waste Management Inc. has ousted its No. 2  
executive as part of a companywide overhaul designed to get the big 
trash hauler's ailing business back on track. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also acknowledged in a filing Monday with the  
Securities and Exchange Commission that the SEC and the New York 
Stock Exchange are conducting inquiries into insider sales of the 
company's stock prior to an earnings warning it issued on July 6. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the filing, Waste Management said that $30.2 million  
was incorrectly reported as operating income for the quarter ending 
March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Including charges, earnings for the three months ended March 31  
were revised to $346.7 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, 
compared to $364.3 million, or $0.58 as originally reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's almost as if we had taken a two year-detour,'' said Hugh  
Holman, an analyst with BancBoston Robertson Stephens. ``The issues 
they are dealing with today are very similar to the same issues the 
old Waste Management was grappling with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the problems the first incarnation of Waste Management  
had involved lax internal controls and overly optimistic 
accounting. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of its management reorganization, Waste Management said  
it was replacing its chairman and chief executive officer, John 
Drury, who has been on medical leave for several months. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodney Proto will leave his job as president and chief operating  
officer and give up his seat on the board of directors, though 
Drury will retain his seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph Whitworth will move from acting chairman to chairman and  
Steve Miller to president and acting chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, a member of the Waste Management board, was chairman and  
CEO of the former Waste Management before last year's merger with 
USA Waste Services. Miller will remain CEO until a permanent 
replacement is hired, and the company also is looking for a chief 
financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The board's actions come in the wake of disappointing earnings  
and inaccurate forecasts, as well as challenges in integrating 
operations after Waste Management combined with Houston-based USA 
Waste Services for $13.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	On July 6, the company warned that second-quarter earnings would  
be hurt by a decline in trash collection revenue. Earlier this 
month, the Oak Brook, Ill.-based Waste Management issued a second 
warning that revised accounting procedures and even worse revenue 
than first thought would further depress earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	In its SEC filing, Waste Management said both the quarterly  
earnings and the insider stock sales were being scrutinized by the 
SEC. It also said the NYSE's Market Trading Analysis Department was 
reviewing the stock transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, at least three class-action lawsuits have resulted  
from the trades. 
</P>
<P>
	Waste Management has previously acknowledged that some top  
officials sold shares in the months before the earnings warning. 
However, the company defended the timing, saying that for many of 
the officials, it was their first opportunity to sell stock in 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Whitworth said the company will dispose of its  
non-strategic and underperforming businesses, including some or all 
of the company's international operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``My highest priority over the coming weeks and months will be  
to ensure the prompt and orderly execution of the board's strategic 
plan,'' Whitworth said. ``We realize that we must deliver results 
before we will see meaningful increases in our share price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts generally applauded the divestiture of international  
operations as a good streamlining move. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a time for them to retreat to the fortress and manage  
the very strong asset base they have in North America,'' Holman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Waste Management were down 62 1/2 cents to $23 in late  
afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Another Ex-Steeler Joins Jaguars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Like so many ex-Steelers before him,  
fullback Tim Lester comes to a new team looking for a fresh start. 
</P>
<P>
	He signed a one-year deal with Pittsburgh's AFC Central rivals,  
the Jacksonville Jaguars, giving him two chances this season to 
show the Steelers exactly what they gave up. 
</P>
<P>
	Lester was the fullback credited with opening up so many big  
holes for Jerome Bettis over the last three years. Bettis 
complained loudly when the Steelers chose to sign untested Jon 
Witman and let Bettis' good friend enter the free-agent market. 
</P>
<P>
	They both should have expected it.  
</P>
<P>
	The Steelers are notorious for letting top free agents get away.  
Lester is the third player, joining Carnell Lake and Deon Figures, 
to leave Pittsburgh for Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really have nothing good to say about them,'' Lester said of  
the Steelers. ``I don't really want to talk about it. But I know a 
lot of guys feel the same way I do. A lot of guys have gone 
elsewhere and have done real well. I hope I can do the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lester said he appreciated Bettis' support, but knew the  
situation was out of both of their hands. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had been together five, six years playing and we became  
very good friends,'' Lester said. ``I guess he had to voice his 
opinion. I heard a lot of people got frustrated about him speaking 
out, but I know in the relationship we built over the years, it was 
something he felt he had to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jaguars seemed solid at the position with third-year veteran  
Daimon Shelton, but were lacking depth after rookie Trevor Bollers 
was lost to a knee injury last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no big secret, everybody thinks this could be the year  
for this team,'' said running back Fred Taylor, who rushed for 
1,223 yards behind Shelton's blocking last year. ``It's time to go 
ahead and get all your weapons and use all of them. Just go after 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lester, a seven-year veteran out of Eastern Kentucky, survived a  
long wait on the free-agent market before signing the deal that 
will pay him $500,000. He missed six games last season with 
injuries to his rotator cuff and knee. 
</P>
<P>
	His stock clearly diminished because of the injuries, but he  
doesn't think it will stop him from competing for a starting job. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's how I'm going to approach it,'' he said. ``I've never  
been a backup. I'm going to approach it like I'm going to get a 
starting job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coughlin said he liked that attitude, but didn't consider the  
signing an indictment of Shelton. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had three fullbacks, we lost one fullback, we needed to  
bring one in, so we brought in the best one available,'' Coughlin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tight end Kyle Brady, the other key free-agent addition to the  
Jaguars offense, said whatever Lester's role, it's bound to help 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suppose coaches at this level are sort of like mechanics on  
the NASCAR circuit,'' Brady said. ``In all respects, they're always 
doing some tuning, trying to get it to the specifications they 
want.''

<HEADLINE> Toys R Us Reports Sales Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARAMUS, N.J. (AP) -- Toys R Us Inc.'s second-quarter earnings  
fell 14 percent compared with the same period a year ago, due to 
costs associated with the development of its Internet subsidiary, 
toysrus.com. 
</P>
<P>
	The Paramus, N.J.-based company reported Monday that it earned  
$12 million, or 5 cents a share, compared with $14 million, or 5 
cents a share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 results include a $4 million charge to cover costs from  
toysrus.com. Last year's second-quarter results also included a $4 
million charge related to debt extinguishment. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial  
had expected the company to earn 6 cents a share for the 
three-month period ended July 31. Shares of Toys R Us rose 62 1/2 
cents at $15.81 3/4 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Second-quarter sales were $2.2 billion, compared to $2 billion  
in the same period a year ago. Sales at stores open at least a 
year, an industry gauge of performance, were up 4 percent in the 
second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Toys R Us has been reorganizing its entire business over the  
past year amid slumping sales and profits. Last year, giant 
discounter Wal-Mart topped Toys R Us as the biggest toy chain in 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Toys R Us has responded by beginning a renovation of its 1,500  
stores, creating a brighter layout that is easier to navigate. The 
company said it remodeled about 80 stores in the second quarter and 
expects to have about 170 stores operating under the new format by 
the upcoming holiday selling season. 
</P>
<P>
	Toys R Us is also stepping up its efforts on the Internet to  
better compete with online rivals Amazon.com and eToys. 
</P>
<P>
	But it has run into some troubles with toysrus.com. Earlier this  
month, Toys R Us named veteran toy industry executive John Barbour 
to head the online unit after University Games founder and CEO 
Robert Moog backed out of the job. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the company announced Monday that it ended its  
agreement with Benchmark Capital, which said earlier this year that 
it would invest in toysrus.com. Benchmark is a Silicon Valley 
venture capital firm that helped bankroll such Internet successes 
as the online auction house eBay. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are confident that the strategic initiatives we are  
undertaking will strengthen our business for the long term,'' chief 
executive Robert Nakasone said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first half of the year, Toys R Us earned $29 million, or  
12 cents a share, compared with $33 million, or 12 cents a share, a 
year ago. Sales were $4.37 billion, compared with $4.06 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Toys R Us operates 1,472 stores; 705 toy stores in the United  
States, 438 international toy stores, including franchise stores, 
211 Kids R Us children's clothing stores and 118 Babies R Us 
stores.

<HEADLINE> Sacramento Kings Sign Tony Delk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Tony Delk, a backup point guard with  
the Golden State Warriors, signed a multi-year contract with the 
Sacramento Kings on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The team declined to disclose terms of the free agent agreement.  
</P>
<P>
	Delk, 25, has averaged 7.8 points, 1.9 rebounds and 2.1 assists  
in 174 regular-season games in his three years in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	He led Kentucky to the 1996 NCAA Championship and was selected  
by the Charlotte Hornets as the 16th pick in the draft that year. 
</P>
<P>
	Delk spent his rookie season with the Hornets and was acquired

<HEADLINE> Every Big Rivalry Starts Somewhere  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) -- Sergio Garcia took $100 off Tiger Woods  
during a practice round at Medinah Country Club early last week. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, he nearly took something much more valuable -- the PGA  
Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was emotional, he was fiery and he never dogged it,'' Woods  
said. ``It was wonderful to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Every great rivalry has to begin somewhere. This one began with  
the tip of a cap, one to the other, across 219 yards of lake and 
lawn and the shadows of an Illinois meadow. If golf is lucky, it 
won't end until well into the next century, until Woods and Garcia 
have to watch their waistlines closer than each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Round 1 went to Woods, along with the Wanamaker Trophy. But the  
final 90 minutes of the final major of the 1990s belongs to the 
ages. 
</P>
<P>
	The show began at the par-3 13th and never slowed. Garcia ran in  
an 18-foot birdie putt there, pulled the ball from the cup and as 
he straightened up, looked directly at Woods back on the tee. With 
a matador's grace, the 19-year-old Spaniard tugged gently at the 
bill of his cap and smiled at his rival, still four years his 
senior but suddenly just three strokes ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted him to know I was still there,'' Garcia said, ``and  
to show him that he has to finish well to win. I did it with good 
feelings, not like, `Make a triple bogey!' or anything. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I was telling him, `If you want to win, you are going to  
have to play well.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods would say afterward he saw all he needed to see when the  
putt rolled in. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to expect your opponent to make it,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	And the second after Garcia did, Woods leaned down and put his  
tee in the ground. In retrospect, he might have lingered over the 
scene a breath longer, giving his nerves a chance to settle down. 
Instead, Woods smoked a 6-iron that rolled through the green and 
settled down some 230 yards later, in a fringe of rough just behind 
the putting surface. He hit one flop shot back over the green, a 
second to 10 feet and two-putted for double bogey. 
</P>
<P>
	As Garcia stood on the 14th green, the roar from behind told him  
as surely as the scoreboard in front of him could: ``Game On!'' He 
was at 11 under, Woods only one stroke ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time he started thinking about reeling in his  
prey. But first the teen-ager had to get hold of his emotions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right there, I realized that the fans were with me,'' Garcia  
said. ``It was something incredible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But only an indication of things to come.  
</P>
<P>
	At the 452-yard, par-4 16th, Garcia blocked his drive right,  
walked to his ball and found it nestled between two roots of a 
tree. He was 189 yards from the pin. If he hit the root behind the 
ball, besides risking a fracture, he risked missing the ball 
altogether. If the ball hit the root in front, it could bounce back 
and hit him -- a two-stroke penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia pulled out a 6-iron. With a ferocity few beside Woods  
could even appreciate, he let it rip. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just closed my eyes,'' Garcia said. ``And well, when I  
opened my eyes and I saw the ball going to the green. I was pretty 
excited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pretty excited?  
</P>
<P>
	The last time you saw a shot that dangerous that good in a major  
championship, it was Arnold Palmer uprooting a shrub with a 6-iron 
at Royal Birkdale nearly 40 years ago. Garcia won't get a plaque 
the way Palmer did -- not yet, anyway -- but he got a spine-tingling 
ovation and a workout to boot, chasing up the fairway behind the 
magnificent escape shot. He two-putted from 60 feet, stopping his 
slide at 10 under. 
</P>
<P>
	And in the way rivals bring out the best in one another, he set  
the stage for Woods to respond with a hero shot of his own. 
</P>
<P>
	At the par-3 17th, Woods hit his tee shot into greenside rough,  
wedged it to 8 feet and found himself facing that moment when 
potential, finally, has to give way to performance. He kept telling 
himself, just let the blade of the putter release. 
</P>
<P>
	It did. Perfectly.  
</P>
<P>
	``And when I looked up,'' Woods said, ``the ball was going in.''  
</P>
<P>
	A few moments later, his approach shot pierced the middle of the  
18th green and the drama went out of the place like the air in a 
balloon. Woods rolled his first putt to the edge, close enough to 
knock the second down with a matchstick. When the ball hit the 
bottom of the hole, he sighed. Then Woods hugged his caddie, his 
mother, his coach and Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has a tremendous amount of fight in him,'' Woods said.  
``You can see it by the way he plays, just the way he walks around 
the golf course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods has plenty of fight in him, too, dragged of him through  
six pressure-packed holes by a challenge from Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
	Now we know what a rivalry looks like. And looking back at the  
``Showdown at Sherwood,'' the made-for-TV event that pitted Woods 
against David Duval, it's a miracle the show didn't get pulled for 
running afoul of the truth-in-advertising laws.

<HEADLINE> Site of L.A. Shooting Reopens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Children were greeted with hugs, love and  
performing clowns today as they returned to the Jewish community 
center that was a place of terror just six days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	It was ``Funny Hair Day'' to let the youngsters forget -- and  
extra security to reassure their parents -- at the reopening of the 
North Valley Jewish Community Center, where an invader wounded 
three small children, a teen and one adult on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the attack, bullet holes have been filled and shattered  
glass replaced, to make the scene as normal as possible, and grief 
counselors were being brought in. 
</P>
<P>
	``My dad always said when you fall off your bike get right back  
on it,'' said Jeffrey L. Rouss, executive vice president of the 12 
Jewish Community Centers of Greater Los Angeles. ``We are sending a 
message that evil will be vanquished. We are not going to let a 
monster like that stop us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least 128 children showed up today for the center's day camp,  
just a shade below the normal Monday turnout of 130. Thirty-seven 
children came for preschool, where 40 is the usual number for a 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Gottlieb dropped off his 4-year-old daughter, Amanda.  
</P>
<P>
	``She seems a little apprehensive. She was 20 feet from the  
bullets,'' Gottlieb said. ``I told her to have a good day, that 
mommy was going to stay with her for a little while and I would 
pick her up later today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buford O. Furrow Jr. was charged with murder and attempted  
murder for allegedly wounding five people inside the center, then 
killing postal carrier Joseph Ileto a few miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	Five-year-old Benjamin Kadish, the only victim still  
hospitalized, was in serious condition at Childrens Hospital Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow, who has ties to hate groups and a history of mental  
illness, turned himself in on Wednesday after fleeing to Las Vegas. 
Police found a small arsenal of weapons and ammunition in the 
vehicles Furrow is believed to have used to get to and from the 
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The center opened shortly after dawn today and parents began  
arriving about 7:30 a.m. with their children. Five police squad 
cars were stationed at the school and uniformed security officers 
stood guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Rouss said the children were greeted inside with ``just hugs and  
love.'' Flowers, balloons, candles and banners were positioned 
outside the iron gate entrance. One of the signs read, ``We will 
overcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We've beefed up security at every JCC site, and it's visibly  
beefed up,'' Rouss told the throng of reporters gathered outside 
the center. Reporters were not allowed inside the school. 
</P>
<P>
	Lesley Pincus dropped off her 6-year-old son, Scott, and said  
the boy was eager about returning. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's fine and I'm fine. The kids, I think, really felt loved  
and special,'' she said. When asked about the heavy security, she 
said, ``It has been a wake-up call for all of us to take extra 
steps to protect ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At nearby California State University, Northridge, on Sunday,  
Gov. Gray Davis, Attorney General Janet Reno and religious leaders 
spoke during a community ``unity rally'' to honor the people who 
saved lives during the rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, a pair of hecklers shouted down Davis when he  
vowed to take assault weapons off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Second Amendment is just as important,'' yelled Irv Rubin  
of the Jewish Defense League, referring to the right to bear arms. 
Last weekend Rubin and thousands of others successfully blocked a 
parade in the nation's capital by white supremacists, including 
Aryan Nations members.

	Davis responded to the hecklers by saying that, as a Vietnam War  
veteran, he knows the destructive power of assault weapons. ``They 
have a place in a theater of war,'' he said, ``but they have no

	Nancy Parris Moskowitz, the center's president, thanked police,

the rally, about 300 individuals received a certificate 
acknowledging their service and stating that a ``Unity Garden'' 
would be created in their honor at the center.

	About 25 members of Unitarian Universalist Church in Canoga Park  
came to the rally to let their Jewish friends and neighbors know 
that the violence that struck their region won't be tolerated, said 
Gail Geisenhainer, the church's minister.

<HEADLINE> Hockey Groups Deny Knowing of Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REGINA, Saskatchewan (AP) -- A group of hockey officials and  
organizations being sued by a former player who was sexually abused 
by his coach filed a defense motion Monday denying responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixteen groups and individuals, including the Canadian Hockey  
Association and the Western Hockey League, filed a joint statement 
of defense at Court of Queen's Bench in Regina. 
</P>
<P>
	They deny charges that they knew former Swift Current Broncos  
coach Graham James had ``sexually assaulted, molested, harassed and 
abused'' players. 
</P>
<P>
	James is on parole after serving a prison sentence for sexually  
abusing former NHL player Sheldon Kennedy and another player. 
</P>
<P>
	The man behind the lawsuit, who can't be identified, was abused  
as a teen player with the Broncos. He is suing 24 people and 
organizations, including James. 
</P>
<P>
	In the lawsuit, the man claims the defendants knew James  
molested players and could have prevented him from coaching in the 
WHL. 
</P>
<P>
	But Aaron Fox, the lawyer for 16 of the defendants, said that's  
not true. 
</P>
<P>
	``They weren't aware of any impropriety going on between the  
plaintiff in this case and Graham James,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit calls for damages in excess of $1 million along with  
compensation for mental suffering and lost economic opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	The man's parents also filed a lawsuit, naming many of the same  
organizations and individuals. They want $50,000 and demand that 
those involved acknowledge their responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the league and team's perspective it was like (the abuse)  
never happened,'' the player's mother told The Canadian Press last 
December. ``We've never received an apology from anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She alleged her son told team officials that James was abusing  
him but nothing was done. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven of the defendants named in the parent's suit also filed a  
defense Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In that defense, the CHA argues that if there were any damages,  
they were caused solely by James ``and in the alternative by the 
actions or omissions of the plaintiffs themselves who were 
ultimately responsible for the care and supervision of their son.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James was sentenced in January 1997 to 42 months in prison for  
the sexual abuse of Kennedy and another player during his eight 
seasons with the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	He was convicted on another set of charges in February 1998 for  
</P>
<P>
 indecently assaulting a 14-year-old Winnipeg boy in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	He is currently on parole in Quebec.  
</P>
<P>
	Fox said he's not worried about a recent Supreme Court ruling  
which found that organizations whose employees commit sex crimes 
can be held vicariously liable in certain situations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think that (the defendants) met the standards that were  
expected of them,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox said he doesn't expect the civil trial to proceed until well  
into next year.

<HEADLINE> Alexander Quits Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lamar Alexander ended his dogged six-year  
pursuit of the White House on Monday, saying ``there's really no 
realistic way to keep going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Quayle, who finished yet two places behind Alexander's  
meager sixth-place showing in the Iowa straw vote, suffered the 
defection of his South Carolina leadership to rival John McCain. 
Quayle aides said he is now reorganizing to concentrate ``almost 
all paid staff'' in just Iowa and New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, the former Tennessee governor, was the first in a  
crowded Republican field to drop out after the weekend's nonbinding 
vote confirmed the Texas governor as front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a powerful force for George W. Bush's nomination in  
this country, and I saw it in Iowa last weekend,'' said Alexander, 
flanked by his wife and children at the Tennessee state Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	His all-out drive to prove himself an improved contender since  
losing to Bob Dole in 1996, ended with an unmatched -- and lonely -- 
21-day blitz through Iowa before the straw poll. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Alexander faced a crowd of news cameras with  
bittersweet humor: ``I seem to be attracting more attention getting 
out than I did getting in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He gave no endorsement to any of his surviving rivals, but  
sounded his refrain suggesting Bush is inexperienced for the job of 
president. Alexander said he feared Republicans might discover 
``during a debate with Albert Gore Jr. that we've nominated someone 
who is not ready to be president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, Bush issued a statement calling Alexander ``a good man  
who poured his heart into his campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush is expected to pick up most of Alexander's fund-raising  
team and perhaps his top adviser in Iowa, former Gov. Terry 
Branstad, who has been courted by Michigan Gov. John Engler, a top 
Bush operative. 
</P>
<P>
	Over in Quayle's camp, described as despondent after the former  
vice president was bested in Iowa by little-known radio host Alan 
Keyes, aides insisted the struggling Quayle was in the race to 
stay. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rats may be jumping off the ship, but the ship isn't  
sinking,'' said Quayle press secretary Jonathan Baron. 
</P>
<P>
	National chairman Kyle McSlarrow cast the loss of campaign  
leaders in South Carolina, the state whose Feb. 19 primary makes it 
a critical gateway to the South, as part of a strategic 
reorganization that would now focus on next winter's leadoff 
nominating contests in Iowa and New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	The scramble to reorganize, despite the brave talk, came as  
aides privately worried Quayle might not be able to turn his 
fortunes around. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle's South Carolina campaign director, Jim Merrill, led the  
desertion of four organizers to McCain, who refused to compete in 
the Iowa straw poll. 
</P>
<P>
	In his resignation letter, Merrill said his job had become a  
full-time fund-raising position. With a candidate in eighth place, 
``it has become apparent that the resources necessary to wage a 
successful campaign will not be forthcoming,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed McMullen, president of a South Carolina conservative think  
tank, wrote Quayle: ``We are losing elected officials and core 
conservatives who believe that your candidacy would be the winning 
team for conservative ideas.'' McMullen's resignation letter was 
released by the McCain campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Buchanan, a repeat Republican contender, also faces tough  
choices. 
</P>
<P>
	He placed behind Gary Bauer, his main rival for the social  
conservative vote, and now must decide whether to push forward, 
give up his third presidential bid, or start fresh with the Reform 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters said Buchanan had not decided on a tack and plans  
were in the works for routine campaign events this week and next. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if Buchanan was in the race to stay, spokesman Bob Adams  
said Monday: ``I'm booking radio ads, while we speak, in New 
Hampshire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in the GOP field, a contented Steve Forbes, who  
finished second in Iowa to Bush, took the week off for time with 
his family before his daughters head back to school. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaigning in New Hampshire, Elizabeth Dole cast her  
third-place finish as a victory earned, not bought, and said she 
hoped to attract Alexander supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, she put a price tag on her efforts leading  
up to the pay-per-vote straw poll -- $250,000, less than a third of 
what Bush spent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that you need to spend gobs of money'' to win,  
Dole told about 50 workers at RealWorld Corporation, a software 
company in Manchester. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll demonstrate that the candidate with the most experience  
is more qualified than the candidates with the most money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, the late-entry dark horse, expressed  
sympathy for Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a really fine fellow. I feel sorry he couldn't make it,''  
Hatch said as he campaigned in Merrimack, N.H. ``I didn't think he 
could make it, but I look at the rest of them, and I don't feel a 
lot of the rest of them can make it either.''

<HEADLINE> A Look at the Columbine Wounded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	An update on some of the most seriously wounded students on the  
day classes resumed at Columbine High School: 
</P>
<P>
	--Richard Castaldo, 17, remained at Craig Hospital on Monday but  
is expected to be released later this week. He was shot eight 
times, suffering a spinal cord injury that left him without feeling 
from the waist down. He was also severely wounded in the left arm. 
He intends to return to Columbine this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	--Anne Marie Hochhalter, 17, was released from Craig Hospital on  
Thursday but continues to undergo rehabilitation. She took a direct 
hit in her spinal cord that left her paralyzed from the waist down. 
She intends to return to Columbine to finish out her senior year 
but has not set a date. 
</P>
<P>
	--Sean Graves, 15, who suffered a spinal cord injury after a  
bullet nicked his spine, has some feeling below the waist and can 
walk with the help of a walker and a therapist. He plans to return 
to Columbine this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	--Patrick Ireland, 17, the student who pulled himself out of a  
second-floor library window during the attack, is undergoing daily 
outpatient treatment at Craig. He was shot twice in the head and 
suffered a brain injury. He is receiving speech and physical 
therapy. He returned to school Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	--Lance Kirklin, 16, returned to Columbine on Monday. He suffered  
five gunshot wounds; a shotgun blast tore away much of the left 
side of his face. He will undergo reconstructive surgery at least 
four more times.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Are Little Changed / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices were little changed Monday ahead of  
Tuesday's inflation report, which could determine whether the 
Federal Reserves will need to raise interest rates for a second 
time this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 3/16 point, or  
$1.87 1/2 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the 
opposite direction, fell to 6.08 percent from 6.10 percent on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer price index, due out Tuesday, is the last major  
economic data release before Fed policy-makers meet next week to 
decide whether to raise short-term interest rates to cool off the 
economy. Few traders were willing to take large positions ahead of 
the data. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader secondary market, prices of short-term Treasury  
securities were unchanged, and intermediate maturities ranged from 
unchanged to 1/16 point higher, reported Bridge Telerate, a 
financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.82 percent with a  
discount of 4.69 percent, up 0.07 percentage point from late 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Six-month yields were 5.09 percent while the discount was 4.80  
percent, up 0.03 percentage point from late Friday. One-year yields 
were 5.19 percent with a discount of 4.94 percent, up 0.04 
percentage point from late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 5.19 percent from 5.06 late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 7/8 to 112 5/8. The average yield to 
maturity was 5.88 percent up from 5.82 percent.

<HEADLINE> New Automatic Lawn Mower Does Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Imagine mowing the lawn in your sleep. Or while  
you golf. 
</P>
<P>
	The ultimate lazy person's lawnmower -- a 15-pound race  
car-shaped contraption that does the job automatically -- should be 
available in the United States early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swedish-built Auto Mower, which will come in  
battery-operated and solar-powered models, is a hit at this year's 
National Hardware Show, drawing crowds who want a peek at what some 
hope is the hands-free future of lawn care. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody wants to work, so it will sell,'' said Bart  
Colenbrander of Toronto, who left his exhibitor booth for a look at 
the mower. ``I've wondered why anyone wasn't making something like 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, Auto Mower manufacturer Husqvarna promises a near-hassle  
free lawn mowing system -- no fumes, no grass clippings to clean up. 
</P>
<P>
	A 20-volt wire around the boundary of the yard tells the mower  
where to cut and prevents it from wandering into flower beds or 
neighbors' yards. 
</P>
<P>
	And because it cuts a fraction of the blade at a time -- but does  
it more often -- the mower leaves no lines on the lawn, product 
manager Denis Bedard said. 
</P>
<P>
	When its 12-volt battery runs low, the mower finds its  
recharging station, juices up and goes back to work, stopping only 
when its preset mowing time is up. It can mow 1,000 square feet per 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
	``What do you care if it takes one hour or 10 hours -- you don't  
have to man it,'' Bedard said. ``In today's environment, we want to 
spend less time on the lawn and more time with the kids and 
recreational activities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $1,500 to $1,800 mower -- it comes with its own burglar alarm  
and security code -- will be targeted to middle- and upper-income 
buyers, Bedard said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Steve DePaepe, whose family has owned Chicago Lawn Mower for  
39 years, said he doubts the mower's selling potential because 
mowers and lawn services are more affordable than ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are looking for cheaper and cheaper products,'' he  
said. ``We've seen a shift from the average consumer buying a 
quality piece to buying an el cheapo. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of our competitors folded because the industry's changed  
so much.''

<HEADLINE> Venator To Exit Noncore Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Venator Group Inc. moved closer to becoming  
primarily a sporting goods retailer with its announcement Monday to 
sell or close eight of its noncore businesses, totaling more than 
500 stores. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York-based company, formerly known as Woolworth, also  
said that its president, Dale Hilpert, was named chief executive 
officer. He will replace Roger Farah, who will remain Venator's 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the latest step in the restructuring of Venator,''  
said John Shanley, an analyst at First Security Van Kasper. ``It's 
a smart move to get rid of those stores that don't have growth 
potential and have limited earnings capabilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's been a tough few years for Venator, which has attempted to  
boost profits by reducing costs and closing more than 4,000 stores 
-- including all of its Woolworth five-and-dime and Kinney Shoe 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Venator lost $113 million, or $1 a share, compared  
with a loss of $10 million, or 7 cents a share, the year before. 
Sales fell to $4.56 billion, from $4.6 billion. It stock is trading 
at about $10, compared to more than $28 two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Venator is now mostly a sporting goods company, with 6,000  
stores, including the Foot Locker and Champs Sports chains. It also 
operates the Northern Group of apparel stores and the accessories 
chain Afterthoughts. 
</P>
<P>
	Venator said the businesses it will now exit include San  
Francisco Music Box, Randy River, Foot Locker Outlets, Colorado 
U.S., Team Edition, Going to the Game, Weekend Edition and some 
Burger King franchises. 
</P>
<P>
	These businesses had sales of $97 million and incurred a pretax  
operating loss of about $26 million for the six months ended July 
31. 
</P>
<P>
	``We anticipated that they would get out of these businesses,  
but we think the timetable was accelerated by the losses that the 
eight businesses had been collecting this year,'' Shanley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Venator will sell up to 51 of its 87 Weekend Edition women's  
apparel stores in Canada to YM Inc., a Toronto-based retailer. 
Details of the transaction were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Venator spokesman Juris Pagrabs said the company will try to  
sell the other seven businesses. If it doesn't find buyers, then 
Venator will consider closing the remaining stores. 
</P>
<P>
	The restructuring charge and operating losses are expected to be  
about $48 million, most of which will be recorded in the three 
months ended July 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the restructuring costs, Venator expects its  
second-quarter earnings to be between 3 cents and 5 cents a share, 
above forecasts of 2 cents a share by Wall Street analysts. Results 
will be announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Venator's shares rose $1.12 1/2 to $10 in trading on the New York  
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``The business seems to be improving and now they will get rid  
of all of these businesses that were a distraction,'' said Alfred 
Kingsley, senior managing director at Greenway Partners, which owns 
14 percent stake in Venator and has been a vocal critic of 
Venator's slow turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
	Hilpert, who will retain the president's title, had been serving  
as chief operating officer, a position that the company has no 
present plans to fill. He joined Venator in 1995 after serving as 
chairman and CEO of Payless Shoe Source. 
</P>
<P>
	Farah, who has been chairman and CEO since 1994, was formerly  
president and chief operating officer at R.H. Macy &AMP; Co. Farah 
recently extended his contract with Venator through 2003, but 
analysts question if he will stay with the company until his 
contract expires.

<HEADLINE> Marine Faces Prison in Vaccine Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAYPORT NAVAL STATION, Fla. (AP) -- A military judge ruled Monday  
that a sailor who refused to take an anthrax vaccine cannot submit 
evidence about the vaccine's safety during his court-martial. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Raymond Kreichelt also ruled during the preliminary  
hearing that the military order requiring Airman Zachary Johnson to 
take the vaccine was legal. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 22, is charged with willfully disobeying a direct order  
and failing to obey a lawful regulation. If convicted, he faces up 
to six months in prison, loss of pay, reduction in rank and a bad 
conduct discharge. 
</P>
<P>
	His court-martial was scheduled to start Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Kreichelt told defense attorneys they could not offer evidence  
linking the anthrax vaccine to Gulf War syndrome or call an expert 
to testify on the vaccine's safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor, Lt. Christopher Ludmer, had argued that medical  
evidence was irrelevant to the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The anthrax vaccine is being given to all 2.4 million members of  
the armed services to protect against biological warfare. The 
Pentagon said that of the 900,000 personnel vaccinated so far, more 
than 79 reported adverse effects, such as rashes, headaches and 
fever, but all recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 military personnel have refused to take the six-shot  
immunization, but Johnson is the first sailor to face a 
court-martial. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, a Marine helicopter crew chief was sentenced to 30  
days in confinement and issued a bad conduct discharge for his 
refusal.

<HEADLINE> US, SKorea Military Exercises Begin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The United States and South Korea  
kicked off a 12-day joint military exercise Monday amid growing 
tensions with North Korea and fears that the communist country may 
test-fire a new long-range missile. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea denounced the exercise as a rehearsal for war on the  
Korean peninsula, warning that it will hurt relations with the 
South and adversely affect talks under way between Pyongyang and 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and South Korea hold several joint military  
exercises each year, routinely prompting criticism from North 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Ferguson, spokeswoman of the U.S. military command in Seoul,  
rejected the North Korean accusations and said the 25th annual 
drill is ``no more than a routine, defensive training exercise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	South Korean President Kim Dae-jung said his country and the  
United States should maintain a strong defense to cope with growing 
North Korean military threats, including a missile launch. 
</P>
<P>
	``Through this exercise, we must let North Koreans know that our  
military posture is firm and strong ever,'' Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
	The exercise is one of the largest conducted annually by the  
U.S. and South Korean armed forces. It mostly involves computer 
simulations designed to evaluate and improve joint contingency 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The training involves 14,000 U.S. soldiers stationed in South  
Korea and 5,400 others brought from the U.S. mainland, Japan and 
Guam, along with 56,000 South Korean troops. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Ridge, the flagship of the U.S. 7th Fleet, will lead an  
unspecified number of warships during the exercise. The Blue Ridge 
is normally based in Yokosuka, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	About 37,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea under a  
defense treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Separate from the joint exercise, South Korea announced plans to  
conduct its own annual field training exercise later this month 
involving a large number of soldiers, police and civilians. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea denounced the South Korean drill as ``intentional  
and premeditated war moves to aggravate the situation on the Korean 
peninsula.'' 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea claims that it has a sovereign right to develop and  
test-fire a missile. But it is believed to be weighing the merit of 
another missile launch, which is certain to invite economic and 
other sanctions from the United States, Japan and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea sent shock waves through the region last August by

<HEADLINE> Ben Jones Operates Novelty Store </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPERRYVILLE, Va. (AP) -- ``Dukes of Hazzard'' devotees can enjoy  
Uncle Jessie's Apple Cider or Daisy's Homemade Country Honey along 
with their reruns. 
</P>
<P>
	And to be sure, Cooter's Place, a theme shop that pays homage to  
the 1980s CBS series, is doing a booming business. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's phenomenal,'' said Ben Jones, who played the show's  
aw-shucks mechanic and operates the novelty store. ``The show seems 
to have found a new generation which is just as enthusiastic about 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who also served as a U.S. congressman from Georgia, moved  
to rural Virginia several years ago. In June, he opened Cooter's 
Place in an old garage near Shenandoah National Park, including a 
replica of the ``General Lee,'' the show's signature orange Dodge 
Charger driven by characters Bo and Luke Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other memorabilia at Cooter's Place: action figures of  
dimwitted deputy Cletus and a can of Hoggoco Motor Oil, along with 
``Dukes'' lunch boxes, napkins and Halloween costumes. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen years after the show was exiled to reruns, Jones still  
has difficulty comprehending its popularity. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like being in a Beatles movie,'' he said. ``Our lives  
changed.''

<HEADLINE> Deal Reached on Marching Band </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Several hundred American student  
marching band members will be dumped from the opening ceremonies of 
the Sydney Olympics as part of a settlement reached with Games 
organizers Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games has agreed  
to pay the American company World Projects Corporation an extra 
$650,000 to train an expanded band of about 2,200 from 20 nations, 
on top of its initial fee of $585,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the initial contract, broken by SOCOG, the 2,000-member  
band was to have included 1,300 Americans from schools in 
California and Georgia, plus 200 Japanese and 500 Australians. 
SOCOG dropped the international band after a public backlash but 
has been forced into an embarrassing backflip. 
</P>
<P>
	The new band is to include 900 Australians and they are to  
provide the largest number from one country. At least 400 American 
students, who have been raising funds to pay for their trips Down 
Under, will be cut from the program. 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG president Michael Knight, heavily criticized over the  
issue, said Monday that the new deal was satisfactory. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the negotiated compromise is not what either side would  
ideally prefer it is now closer to the concept of a world band,'' 
Knight said. 
</P>
<P>
	``WPC has taken full responsibility for reducing the number of  
Americans, maintaining the Japanese numbers and recruiting other 
young musicians from around the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The out-of-court deal was settled in the midst of legal action  
Monday after WPC attorney Paul Brereton accused SOCOG of a 
``calculated, deliberate and flagrant'' breach of contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Brereton added that SOCOG's actions were ``a deliberate  
flaunting of the rights of World Projects, partly to pander to what 
was perceived as public opinion and partly to avoid a perceived 
loss of revenue through ticket sales.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing before Justice John Bryson lasted just over an hour  
until an adjournment was called. When the parties returned, 
Brereton told the court that the matter was settled. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue became an embarrassing public relations disaster for  
Knight and SOCOG after the board dumped the student band members. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of a seven-minute performance at the opening ceremony,  
the students were offered a chance to play at non-Olympic venues in 
Sydney during the Games, including the Opera House. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight's handling of the matter has come under attack locally  
and internationally and he admitted last week that the board had 
``collectively made a mess'' of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight told reporters July 6 there was no way he would reinstate  
overseas performers in the opening ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, we've made a decision nearly two weeks ago at the board to  
remove the foreign musicians from the massed band during the 
opening ceremony and that decision stands,'' Knight said at the 
time.

<HEADLINE> German Gas Co. Bids for Competitor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Linde AG, a German engineering and  
industrial gas company, is offering $3.7 billion for rival Swedish 
industrial gas group AGA AB. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined companies would have an 11 percent share of the  
global market and become the world's fourth-largest industrial gas 
group, said Gerhard Full, Linde's chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Linde already has 12.8 percent of the shares in AGA, and it  
reached agreement with major shareholders on Saturday to increase 
its stake to 62.5 percent. At a news conference Monday, Full said 
the AGA deal could be completed within two months. 
</P>
<P>
	Linde also is working on the acquisition of Hoechst AG's 66  
percent share in gas company Messer-Griesheim GmbH. Should both 
deals go through, Linde would control 16 percent of the global gas 
market and rank second after French Air Liquide. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement outlining Linde's bid for AGA, the German company  
said the alliance would mean lower distribution and production 
costs. Job cuts in Scandinavia were unlikely, Full said. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the Linde takeover offer pushed AGA's stock up 5.3  
percent on the Stockholm market.

<HEADLINE>  Russia Pounds Rebel-Held Villages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOTLIKH, Russia (AP) -- Plumes of smoke rose over three contested  
villages in the Caucasus Mountains today after Russian jets and 
helicopter gunships struck at dawn in a renewed attempt to drive 
out Islamic militants entrenched there. 
</P>
<P>
	After a quiet night, Russian Su-25 jets and Mi-8 helicopters  
began hammering the villages at 6 a.m. and continued airstrikes 
throughout the morning. Smoke was visible from Botlikh, the nearby 
town where forward Russian forces are based. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's offensive in the southern republic of Dagestan is  
concentrated on the isolated villages of Ansalta, Rahata and 
Shodroda, where the rebels are thought to be concentrated, just a 
few miles from the rugged border with the breakaway region of 
Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
	Chechnya, which denies any connection to the rebels, declared a  
state of emergency Sunday, beefing up border posts, putting troops 
on combat alert and imposing a partial curfew. 
</P>
<P>
	In Moscow, President Boris Yeltsin promised ``rigid measures''  
against the militants, but said he would not impose any state of 
emergency. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will bring order both to Dagestan and other republics in  
the North Caucasus,'' Yeltsin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Viktor Kazantsev, commander of the North Caucasus military  
district, insisted that Russian troops need only a few days to get 
rid of the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Shamil Basayev, the Chechen warlord leading the  
militants, told Russian journalists he would unleash a new military 
operation against Russia in less than three days and bring eventual 
independence to Dagestan. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's Air Force said it attacked 18 targets Sunday, and  
destroyed two buses carrying militants. Warplanes also were 
dropping mines to block possible rebel escape routes. 
</P>
<P>
	Dagestani volunteers fighting with the Russian troops caused an  
intentional mini-avalanche Sunday that trapped and killed dozens of 
rebels, according to Dagestan's Interior Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's Interior Ministry acknowledged that it bombed suspected  
guerrilla positions just inside Chechnya on Saturday, and the 
government has said it will strike inside the territory if it 
considers such attacks necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Bombing raids on Chechnya, however, risk widening the conflict.  
And Russian forces appear reluctant to launch a major ground attack 
and risk heavy casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	After 10 days of fighting and hundreds of Russian sorties, the  
rebels have full control of several villages, but have not been 
able to extend their operations beyond the remote hamlets in the 
mountains along the border region. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen Russian soldiers have been killed and 40 wounded since  
the fighting began, according to Russia's Interior Ministry. The 
rebels have lost 400 fighters, and 300 more have been wounded, 
according to the ministry. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures could not be independently confirmed.  
</P>
<P>
	The fighting began Aug. 7, when rebels crossed from Chechnya and  
seized several villages. The conflict is the worst inside Russia 
since Chechnya's 1994-96 war for independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Chechnya has effectively been independent since Russian troops  
pulled out nearly three years ago, though Moscow still claims it is 
part of Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Dagestan, a neighboring republic on the Caspian Sea, has shown  
no sign of splitting from Moscow. Dagestan's political leaders are 
working closely with the Russian military, and Dagestani volunteers 
have made up part of the force fighting the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the militants fighting in Dagestan apparently belong to  
the fundamentalist Wahhabi sect and are seeking an independent 
Islamic republic in the mostly Muslim Caucasus Mountains region. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Dagestan's interior minister, Adilgerei Magomedtagirov,  
acknowledged that some of the rebels are Dagestanis who ``brought 
armed foreign gunmen to our homeland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dagestani authorities also said today that two missing Polish  
scientists were probably kidnapped. A van belonging to them was 
found last Tuesday about 45 miles southwest of the Dagestani 
capital, Makhachkala. Bloodstains and signs of a scuffle were found 
at the scene, said a spokesman for the local Interior Ministry's 
anti-abduction squad. 
</P>
<P>
	Zofia Fiszer-Malanowska, the director of the International  
Environment Center of the Polish Academy of Science, and her deputy 
Ewa Marchwinska-Wyrwal were in Dagestan at the invitation of the 
Biology Institute in Makhachkala. They had been expected to return 
home Aug. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	The two were on a trip to study rare animal species. A pair of  
Dagestani scientists accompanying them was also missing.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Probes Teen Inmate Drug Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Stanford University tests of a  
psychiatric drug on 61 teen-age inmates may have violated a state 
law banning medical research on prisoners, state officials said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The tests were conducted over eight weeks in 1997 at a  
California Youth Authority correctional center in Stockton on 
inmates ages 14 to 18 who were convicted of violent offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	They were given varying dosages of Depakote, a prescription drug  
used to control epileptic seizures, to determine whether it made 
them less aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no evidence any of the youths suffered ill effects from  
the experiment, such as vomiting, hair loss, depression or other 
side effects associated with the drug, said J.P. Tremblay, 
assistant director of the California Youth Authority. 
</P>
<P>
	But the tests were conducted without the knowledge or approval  
of then-CYA Director Francisco Alacorn or his legal office, and the 
tests may be a violation of state law, Tremblay said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The process fell down here. But the idea was not necessarily  
bad,'' added Lisa Beutler, undersecretary of the Youth and Adult 
Correctional Agency. She said researchers could find medication to 
reduce violent tendencies. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Stanford said university officials took steps to  
make sure the study posed ``a low risk and direct benefit'' to the 
inmates and complied with state and federal laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The question of legality is cloudy because there are conflicting  
laws, Ms. Beutler said. 
</P>
<P>
	One says that ``no biomedical research shall be conducted on any  
prisoner in this state.'' But a separate law, written for inmates 
with the AIDS virus, lets prisoners take experimental drugs if they 
are in ``the best interests of the patient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Gray Davis has asked the state attorney general and new  
inspector general to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	Current CYA Director Greg Zermeno, who learned about the tests a  
few weeks after taking office earlier this year, also said he was 
taking steps to assure similar tests will ``never happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also under investigation is how consent was obtained.  
</P>
<P>
	The teen-agers volunteered for the Depakote study, and officials  
mailed consent forms to parents. But in some cases in which parents 
didn't respond within 30 days, the CYA gave consent on behalf of 
the parents, Tremblay said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Rockies To Fire GM Gebhard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The Colorado Rockies will reportedly fire general  
manager Bob Gebhard, the only person who has held the post with the 
7-year-old team, and the move could be made as early as today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver Post, citing sources close to the team, reported that  
there has been so much speculation about Gebhard's dismissal that 
an announcement was expected soon, possibly today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Post quoted part-owner Jerry McMorris as saying, ``Any  
speculation regarding this would be premature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, owners McMorris and Charlie and Dick Monfort  
said they would wait until the current season was over before 
evaluating Gebhard's performance. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies are expected to interview several replacement  
candidates both inside and outside the organization and the owners 
also want the new general manager to work closely with manager Jim 
Leyland on all personnel decisions, the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	It said Gary Hughes, hired last fall as vice president of player  
personnel, was expected to be one candidate, and added that others 
might be Detroit GM Randy Smith, Cleveland assistant GM Mark 
Shapiro. 
</P>
<P>
	Gebhard, 56, was hired in 1991 and built the Rockies team from  
the ground up. In the 1992 expansion draft he selected players 
including Vinny Castilla, Curtis Leskanic and Kevin Ritz. He also 
traded for Dante Bichette and signed Andres Galarraga. 
</P>
<P>
	In their third season, the Rockies reached the playoffs as the  
1995 National League wild card -- the fastest an expansion franchise 
had ever qualified for the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Rockies have disappointed fans since, posting records of  
83-79 in 1996 and 1997 and falling to 77-85 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout last season, there was speculation either Gebhard or  
manager Don Baylor, or both, would be fired after the season. 
Ownership ultimately decided to fire Baylor and replace him with 
Leyland, who won a World Series with the expansion Florida Marlins 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite sweeping a double-header Sunday from the Montreal Expos,  
the Rockies are in last place in the NL West, 15 games under .500 
and 15 1/2 games behind the first-place Arizona Diamondbacks, a 
second-year franchise.

<HEADLINE> Report: Rockies To Fire GM Gebhard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Despite speculation Colorado general manager Bob  
Gebhard will be fired soon, Rockies owner Jerry McMorris said 
Monday a decision won't be made until after the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver Post, citing major league sources close to the  
ownership group, reported Monday that Gebhard will be fired and 
said an announcement could be made later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no press conference today, there is none tomorrow,  
there is none scheduled,'' McMorris said. ``It's all pure 
speculation and it's premature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gebhard was hired in 1991, shortly after the franchise was  
awarded and two years before it started play. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, McMorris and co-owners Charlie Monfort and  
Dick Monfort said they would wait until after the season before 
re-evaluating Gebhard's performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We evaluate our people at the end of every year,'' McMorris  
said. ``It's fair to say we're going to stay with our existing 
policy. I guess everything is subject to change, of course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if the ownership group has had discussions about Gebhard's  
future, McMorris said, ``We've had discussions about our season and 
our frustrations, why our record isn't any better. But we're 
nowhere near ready to make our total evaluation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout 1998, when the Rockies struggled early and wound up  
77-85, there was speculation about the futures of Gebhard and 
manager Don Baylor. The Rockies fired Baylor after the season and 
replaced him with Jim Leyland. 
</P>
<P>
	Gebhard, whose contract runs through the 2000 season, won a  
reprieve, but ownership fortified the front office last fall by 
hiring veteran baseball official Gary Hughes as vice president of 
player personnel and giving Keli McGregor, who heads the team's 
business operations, added responsibilities in the baseball 
department. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes haven't helped. Colorado began Monday 52-67, last in  
the NL West, 15 1/2 games behind division-leading Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question that in most people's minds we have  
underachieved,'' McMorris said, ``and that has led to a lot of 
speculation. This is the latest round of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Post reported the Rockies will interview several replacement  
candidates both inside and outside the organization, and the owners 
want the new general manager to work closely with Leyland on all 
personnel decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Gebhard, 56, led the Rockies to the playoffs in 1995 as the NL  
wild card, the fastest an expansion franchise had ever qualified 
for the postseason. Six of the nine players who started Game 1 of 
the division series against the Atlanta Braves were in place by the 
end of the expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Rockies have disappointed since, going 83-79 in both  
1996 and 1997 before the sharp dropoff last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Gebhard took Vinny Castilla, Curtis Leskanic and Kevin Ritz in  
the expansion draft, traded for Dante Bichette and signed Larry 
Walker and a supposedly washed-up first baseman named Andres 
Galarraga. 
</P>
<P>
	But has been criticized for other moves, such as the  
acquisitions of Greg Harris, Bill Swift and Bret Saberhagen, and 
the departures of Galarraga, Walt Weiss, Andy Ashby, Brad Ausmus, 
Joe Girardi and Armando Reynoso.

<HEADLINE> Alexander Mulls GOP Race Exit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Decision time nears for former Tennessee  
Gov. Lamar Alexander -- and possibly other Republican presidential 
contenders -- as Texas Gov. George W. Bush suggests his rivals 
should reassess their status. 
</P>
<P>
	As Republicans spent Sunday analyzing a nonbinding straw poll  
the day before in Ames, Iowa, Bush was getting the best reviews and 
sounding very confident following his victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody's going to have to reassess their positions  
and find out whether or not they can stay competitive,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said Alexander is virtually certain to abandon his run for  
the GOP nomination because of his poor showing in the straw poll. 
The candidate conceded that ``a powerful force'' seems to be 
pushing Bush toward the 2000 nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's straw poll is an every-four-years exercise viewed by  
many as the first electoral test of a presidential campaign. The 
vote, which Bush won with about 30 percent of the ballots, gave 
definition to a large field of rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander was clearly dejected and near the end of his rope over  
his sixth-place finish in the nine-candidate field despite years of 
nonstop campaigning. Aides said he met privately with major 
backers, including former Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, before heading 
home to assess his options. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior aides to Alexander, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said the campaign faced ``some degree of shutting down,'' with a 
decision coming as early as today. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, strapped for money and lagging in the polls, stopped  
campaigning elsewhere for a near-exclusive focus on Iowa's 
high-profile straw poll. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a powerful force in this country to nominate George W.  
Bush,'' Alexander said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' ``In the next 
day or two I'll be thinking about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Vice President Dan Quayle rejected any talk he also might  
quit despite his lowly eighth-place finish. ``The No. 1 rule of 
politics is to peak on Election Day,'' and that's months away, he 
said on CNN. 
</P>
<P>
	But while Quayle spoke bravely, there was talk from some of his  
top aides that his campaign also was short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's Sunday was quite different. ``We met our expectations,''  
the elated candidate declared. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokeswoman Karen Hughes told NBC that Bush is increasingly the  
target of rivals because ``they think he's well on the road to 
being the Republican nominee for the White House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Publisher Steve Forbes said his strong second-place showing  
means Bush must now engage him on issues and in serious campaign 
debate. ``So far, he (Bush) hasn't put a lot on the table,'' he 
said on ABC's ``This Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Money plus no message equals mush,'' Forbes said. ``Voters  
want real substance. Voters want an honest debate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Red Cross President Elizabeth Dole gave her campaign a  
boost with a third-place showing. At a Sunday afternoon rally in 
her headquarters to thank supporters, she said she was off to New 
Hampshire and said: ``We have an invisible army, and that's another 
reason we won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other clear developments emerged as strategists began assessing  
the impact of a straw poll that drew heated competition and 
millions of dollars in spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Commentator Pat Buchanan mounted a strong showing for the GOP  
nomination in the last election cycle but finished fifth in the 
straw poll. He dodged questions on CBS and Fox about whether he 
would bolt the party to run as an independent or third-party 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	And on NBC and CNN, conservative activist Gary Bauer said his  
fourth-place showing solidified him as the leader of social 
conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona Sen. John McCain, the only contender to skip the straw  
poll, said he might bypass Iowa's leadoff precinct caucuses next 
February as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now I'm leaning toward it,'' McCain said today on ABC's  
``Good Morning America'' when asked if he would skip Iowa. ``I'd 
like to see how the climate looks. ... New Hampshire is the 
first-in-the-nation status, South Carolina is right after that. ... 
I think they are of transcendent importance.''

<HEADLINE> Use Restraint When Buying Computers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Going away to college means leaving the family PC, and that  
usually means another gut punch to a budget that's already reeling 
from tuition bills the size of small national defense budgets. 
</P>
<P>
	Exercise a little restraint and make the blow as soft as  
possible, without sacrificing anything your kid really needs. Basic 
systems today at or under $1,200 offer more than enough computing 
power for any academic task and still have plenty of muscle for 
that rare break from studies when your student might play a game. 
</P>
<P>
	First, Windows or Macintosh? For years, the answer has been a  
PC, but the rise of the funny-colored iMac has changed that to a 
coin toss if the major use of the system is going to be academic 
work and connection to a school's network. 
</P>
<P>
	The iMac bundles the essential components -- except a floppy disk  
drive -- into a $1,199.97 bundle that includes an Ethernet 
connection, 56-kilobit modem, 24-speed CD-ROM drive, six gigabytes 
of disk space, 32 megabytes of RAM, speakers and a 15-inch color 
monitor all bossed by a 333-megahertz PowerPC G3. Bundled software 
includes the AppleWorks suite and the usual Internet browsers. The 
operating system is Mac OS 8.5.1. 
</P>
<P>
	In the PC world, $999 buys the Gateway Essential 400. You get an  
Intel Celeron processor at 400 megahertz, 32 megabytes of RAM, 
40-speed CD-ROM drive, sound card, speakers, 56-kilobit modem 6.8 
gigabyte hard drive. Figure on another $25 for an Ethernet network 
card. The software suite is Microsoft Works and the operating 
system is Windows 98. 
</P>
<P>
	At Dell, a comparable system, the Dimension L400c, is $899. The  
hard drive on the L400c is 4.3 gigabytes, and the system RAM is 64 
megabytes. Otherwise, it pretty much tracks the Gateway offering. 
</P>
<P>
	Over at Compaq, the Prosignia Desktop 320 for $799 also has a  
4.3 gigabyte hard drive, the 400-megahertz Intel Celeron processor, 
32-speed CD-ROM drive and 32 megabytes of RAM, but it offers 16 
megabytes of video memory while the others have eight. It has 
comparable software, but if you want a modem, that's $39 more. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the PC packages include 15-inch color monitors.  
</P>
<P>
	The three PC manufacturers also will customize the system for  
you, but the price goes up more often than it goes down. And in all 
cases, shipping is extra if you're buying online or by telephone. 
And you may get pitches on ``expandability,'' but most of us never 
open a PC's case, and those of us who do, except for hobbyists, 
would rather not, so don't pay extra for capabilities you're 
unlikely to use. 
</P>
<P>
	Which one? I've used and liked systems from all three  
manufacturers over the years, but I've had the longest experience 
with Gateway and it's been a good one. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter what system you select, your student will need a  
printer. Make it a color inkjet -- they're small and quiet, a big 
consideration in cramped dormitories. Shop Lexmark, Epson, Canon 
and Hewlett-Packard in the $150 range for a color printer. You can 
pay more, but it isn't worth it to generate mostly monochrome 
college papers. And, sometimes with sales and rebates, you can pay 
less for output in the 600-dot-per-inch range.

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves New Sleeping Pill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, N.J. (AP) -- The Food and Drug Administration has  
approved Sonata, a new prescription sleeping pill that can be taken 
in the middle of the night without worries of feeling groggy in the 
morning, drugmaker American Home Products said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sonata should hit the pharmacy shelves in about a month.  
</P>
<P>
	Users must be able to stay in bed for four or more hours in  
order to avoid that ``hungover'' feeling often associated with 
sleeping aids, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of Sonata has not been set yet, although a company  
official said it will be ``competitively priced.'' Ambien, the 
nation's most widely prescribed sleeping pill, has an average 
wholesale price of $1.65 to $2.14 per pill, depending on the 
dosage. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts say Sonata may reduce fears some people have about  
becoming dependent because they won't be tempted to take it every 
night -- before they are sure they cannot fall asleep. 
</P>
<P>
	Insomnia affects nearly 84 million Americans, according to the  
National Sleep Foundation. It may be caused by lifestyle changes 
such as a new home or job, jetlag, pain from arthritis or 
headaches, stress or anxiety, or use of certain medications. 
</P>
<P>
	Sonata was approved in Europe this summer. It is being sold in  
Germany, Sweden and Denmark.

<HEADLINE> Boeing, Machinists Start Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATAC, Wash. (AP) -- Boeing and its largest union formally  
started round-the-clock negotiations Monday on a new three-year 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	At a joint news conference, lead Boeing negotiator Jerry Calhoun  
and Dick Schneider, head negotiator for the International 
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, said they were 
confident an agreement could be reached. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are here to negotiate the best contract we can, and not to  
negotiate a strike,'' Schneider told a news conference at a hotel 
near Seattle-Tacoma International Airport where the talks are 
taking place. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe at the end of the day everyone's interests can be  
satisfied,'' Calhoun said. 
</P>
<P>
	Job security, control of pension funds and work schedules are  
the key issues going into the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks come at a crucial time for Boeing, which is facing  
tough competition from Airbus Industrie to build planes for the 
world's airlines. If a strike occurs, it could cut short Boeing's 
financial recovery following two troubled years. 
</P>
<P>
	The union represents 44,000 of Boeing's 210,000 workers  
worldwide, mostly in the Seattle area. 
</P>
<P>
	The current contract expires Sept. 2. The Machinists have gone  
on strike in two of the past three contract talks, most recently 
for 69 days in 1995.
