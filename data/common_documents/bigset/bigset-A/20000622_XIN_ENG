ISLAMABAD, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Foreign Minister
Abdul Sattar Wednesday said there is an improved understanding and
appreciation of Pakistan's perceptions and compulsions by the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The United States has noted Islamabad's national security
concerns, Sattar said while briefing the cabinet on his recent
visit to Washington and meetings with U.S.officials.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet met here under the chairmanship of Chief Executive
General Pervez Musharraf.
</P>
<P>
Sattar said his discussions with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott on nuclear issues, which were the main purpose of
his visit to Washington, were satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. side appreciated steps taken by Pakistan to ensure
the custodial safety of strategic assets and prevent export of
sensitive technology," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Washington "expressed regrets at the delay in Pakistan
's signing of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) which the
previous government had pledged it would do by September 1999," he
added.
</P>
<P>
According to Sattar, Washington also expressed satisfaction
over Pakistan's policy for the revival of the economy and measures
for the introduction of genuine democracy in the country.

NEW DELHI, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Sixteen people, including 13
militants, have been killed in India-controlled Jammu and Kashmir
since Tuesday evening, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported

blow" to the pro-Pakistan Hizbul Mujahideen outfit by gunning down

<HEADLINE> India Welcomes Verdict in Atlantique Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 21 (Xinhua) -- India Wednesday welcomed a
verdict of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) which rejected
Pakistan's plea for 16 million U.S. dollars in damages from New
Delhi for the shooting down of its military combat aircraft
Atlantique on August 10 last year, the Press Trust of India (PTI)
reported.
</P>
<P>
Through its comments, the ICJ has vindicated India's stand that
the Simla Agreement and the Lahore Declaration are the very
cornerstone of Indo-Pak relations, the PTI quoted an Indian
Foreign Office spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the ICJ's decision to uphold India's submission
that the court had no jurisdiction in the matter, the spokesman
said India welcomed the court's observations that the two
neighbors should settle their disputes through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
"India stands committed to dialogue and calls on Pakistan to
create the proper environment for such a dialogue through
cessation of cross-border terrorism and the abandonment of hostile
propaganda," he added.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Police Ban Hezbollah Leader's Phone Address </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian police Wednesday banned a
phone address to be given by the leader of Lebanese Hezbollah
guerrillas to a rally staged by the Palestinian Islamic Resistance
Movement (Hamas) in the West Bank town of Jenin.
</P>
<P>
The police threatened to disperse the rally, held in
commemoration of the Prophet's birthday and Israel's May 24
withdrawal from south Lebanon, if Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah,
secretary-general of Hezbollah, addressed it on the phone.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday evening, the Palestinian police decided to repatriate
Nasrallah's family members from the Shojai'ya district in Gaza,
under the request by local headmen to prevent the recurrence of
clashes.
</P>
<P>
Quoting Director of Gaza Strip Police General Ghazi al-Jibali,
the Palestinian daily Al-Quds reported on Wednesday that 15 of
Nasrallah family members who lived in Shojai'ya would be moved to
another place in Gaza to prevent "further clashes."
</P>
<P>
The family is threatened with revenge after some of its members
murdered members of other families, Jibali noted.
</P>
<P>
After the completion of Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon on
May 24, Nasrallah urged the Palestinians to resume armed resistance
to end Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
The dramatic developments in south Lebanon encouraged Hamas,
which opposes the Middle East peace process, to adopt the line of
Hezbollah to continue armed struggle against Israel.

<HEADLINE> Jewish Spies Not to Be Executed: Iranian Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iranian judiciary official
said here on Wednesday that the 13 Iranian Jews accused of spying
for Israel will not be sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
Those accused of spying for Israel will not be sentenced to
execution if they are not proved to be Mohareb (person in fight
against God), said Husseinali Amiri, head of the Justice Department
of the southern Fars Province, where the accused are under trial.
</P>
<P>
The official added that so far no Moharebeh (fighting against
God) allegations have been lodged against those involved in the
espionage, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said the sentences will be issued at the latest by June 30
in proportion with the effects left by the actions carried out by
the spies within their espionage ring.
</P>
<P>
The trial of the 13 Jews by a revolutionary court in the
southern province opened on April 13. So far nine of the suspects
have reportedly admitted having connections with Israel's security
service.
</P>
<P>
The 13 Jews were arrested more than a year ago along with eight
Muslims accused of the same crimes. There have been speculations
that the accused Jews might be sentenced to death.

Barak and leaders of the Council of Jewish Communities of the West
Bank, which is called Judea and Samaria by the Jews according to
the biblical tradition, and Gaza.

<P>
Settlers in the West Bank and Gaza have been staging frequent

JERUSALEM -- Israel's leftist party Meretz decided Wednesday to
quit Prime Minister Ehud Barak's coalition government in what it

Three Meretz cabinet ministers will tender their resignations to
Barak later on Wednesday after the party's 10 Knesset (parliament)
members met and made the decision earlier, according to Israel
Television.
</P>
<P>
Meretz's decision may improve Barak's chances to save his
floundering government from a deepening crisis caused by defection
of the biggest coalition partner, the ultra-orthodox Shas party,
which demanded more funds for its ill-managed school system and
legalization of its radio stations. (BC-Israel-Meretz-Coalition)

<HEADLINE> 0621-52FFF Burundi Peace Agreement May Be Signed in July: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 21 (Xinhua) -- A peace agreement to end the
long- running civil war in Burundi may be signed by all the
warring parties early next month, said Judge Mark Bomani, leader
of the mediation team for the Burundi peace process here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Burundi peace facilitator and former South African
president Nelson Mandela is to present a final draft compromise
agreement to the 19 Burundi delegations scheduled to meet in July
in the northern town of Arusha, Tanzania, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The facilitation team will meet next week to revise the draft
compromise text before Mandela meets with the 19 delegations,"
Bomani told local news reporters.
</P>
<P>
"We are right on course and everything is going as planned," he
said, expressing his high hopes that the 81-year-old Mandela may
finally make a breakthrough in the 23-month old talks.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not say whether the armed rebels and the
Burundi government have made any vows to sign the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The Hutu rebels have demanded for 51 percent representation in
the army and control of the government, but Mandela was proposing
a 49-49 representation for both Tutsis and Hutu ethnic groups and
a 2 percent representation for the Twa ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
Burundi has an ethnic composition of 85 percent Hutu, 14
percent Tutsi and 1 percent Twa.
</P>
<P>
According to Bomani, a committee of the peace talks, Committee
Five on Implementation and Guarantees, is currently at a meeting
in Arusha in preparation for the next round of talks.
</P>
<P>
Sources from Arusha said that during the week-long meeting,
Committee Five would deliberate on how to integrate the armed
rebel groups into a new national defense force.
</P>
<P>
Repatriation of hundreds of thousands of Burundian refugees
currently being sheltered in refugee camps in Tanzania would be
another topic, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Heads of the 19 delegations would also deliberate on security
of exiled Burundian leaders and refugees upon their arrival in
Burundi after the signing of a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
The civil war in the tiny central African country has killed
more than 200,000 people, displaced more than 1 million others and
confined several hundreds of thousands in "regroupment camps".
</P>
<P>
The war started when the first democratically elected Hutu
president Melchior Ndadaye was murdered by Tutsi soldiers in 1983.

<HEADLINE> Liberia Deploys Troops at Diplomatic Enclave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Liberia deployed anti-terrorist
troops at the diplomatic enclave in Monrovia on Wednesday with
concerns raising among foreign diplomats over the state of
security in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Liberian President Charles Taylor told a press conference in
his office that the move was prompted by "some friendly western
intelligence sources".
</P>
<P>
"That diplomatic enclave contains Americans, French, British
and major diplomatic embassies. We have a duty to protect them,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Taylor confirmed that his government had advised British
nationals and none- governmental organizations to suspend working
in certain regions of Liberia because of "some anti-British
sentiments being harbored by some individuals".
</P>
<P>
The development came after Britain proposed the European Union
(EU) withhold a 47 million U.S. dollar aid package to Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Britain is reported to have presented intelligence materials to
the EU foreign ministers alleging Taylor's support for the rebels
of the Revolutionary United Front in neighboring Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Taylor has denied any links with the rebels other than those
sanctioned by the sub-regional body, the Economic Community of
West African States, which sent intervention force to restore the
elected Sierra Leone President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
"We regret this (withholding of aid) very much. We do believe
that it is inhumane for the British to do this," Taylor lamented
at Wednesday' s press conference.

<P>
BRUSSELS, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Referee Gilles Veissiere was hit
on his eye by coin throw from the crowd after Spain's dramatic 4-3
victory over Yugoslavia at Euro 2000 on Wednesday in Bruges of
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
After Spain scoring two goals deep into the injury time, A man
draped in a Yugoslav flag broke through stewards and barbed wire
and ran the full length of the pitch in a bid to attack the
referee.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish players protected the official until stewards
belatedly came to his assistance.
</P>
<P>
On his way off the field, Veissiere was struck in the eye by a
coin thrown from the stand, while flares were thrown onto the
pitch after each of the Yugoslav goals.
</P>
<P>
A UEFA spokesman confirmed: "The referee was hit in the eye by
a coin. He was bleeding from the cut but it's not a serious injury.
"
</P>
<P>
The first lapse in security occurred when a Yugoslav fan ran
onto the field to protest the sending-off Slavisa Jokanovic in the
62nd minute and had to be escorted away by police.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Stresses Need for Aiding World's Poorest Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
stressed on Thursday that developed countries should continue to
provide aid to the poorest countries and again rejected the U.S.
doctrine of "trade, not aid" for Third World countries.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the magazine "Choice" to be published by
the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), Chirac said that
aid for development "remains indispensable for all the countries
still deprived of access to international financial investment."
</P>
<P>
The content of the interview was issued on Thursday by the
Elysee presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
Chirac regretted that some countries think that economic growth
and trade are sufficient to resolve the problems of under-
development and great poverty in the world.
</P>
<P>
``Trade, not aid, this is what some people have repeated here
and there, while the situation of underdevelopment continues to
expand, whose results are that dozens of countries are simply
excluded from development,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The interview was given one week from the U.N. ``Week of
Development'' which will start on June 29 and one month from the
Group of Eight (G8) summit to be held in Okinawa, Japan.
</P>
<P>
``It is evident that to go out of the situation of
underdevelopment, the most underprivileged should be helped to
overcome their handicap at the beginning. This is the role of
public aid for development,'' said Chirac.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Calls on DRC to Reopen Mediator's Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Thursday called on the Government of the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC) to reopen the Kinshasa-based office of the Facilitator
of the National Inter-Congolese.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was contained in a statement read to the press by
the president of the Security Council, Jean-David Levitte of
France, at the end of the closed Council meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The members of the Council deplored the lack of cooperation
of the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo with the
Facilitator of the National Inter-Congolese Dialogue designated
with the assistance of the Organization of African Unity (OAU),
including the recent closure of the office of the Facilitator,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"They called on the Government of the Democratic Republic of
the Congo to reaffirm its full commitment to the National Dialogue
which constitutes a central element of the Lusaka Agreement," the
statement said. "They called for the reopening of the office of
the Facilitator."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council met Thursday behind closed doors to be
briefed by the U.N. Secretariat on the latest development in the
DRC, including the situation in the northeastern town of Kisangani,
where Rwandan and Ugandan clashed two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
"The members of the Council were deeply concerned at the
information that all forces and armed groups have not yet
completed their withdrawal from Kisangani," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"They reiterated their demand that the Congolese armed
opposition and other armed groups immediately and completely
withdraw from Kisangani, and called on all parties to the Cease-
fire Agreement to respect the demilitarization of the city and its
environs," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in the DRC province of Equator, the Security
Council "called on all parties to cease hostilities throughout the
territory of the DRC and to cooperate fully with" the U.N. mission
in the DRC, known as MONUC, the statement said. "They called on
all parties to implement fully all provisions of the Lusaka
Agreement and relevant Security Council resolutions."
</P>
<P>
Beginning on July 10, 1999, warring parties signed the Lusaka
accord in a bid to end the many-sided conflicts in the central
African country, formerly called Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe supports the DRC Government,
headed by President Laurent Kabila, in fighting against rebels,
backed by Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Kabila said in Kinshasa Wednesday that he was shutting down the
office of the Facilitator, Ketumile Masire, who is a former
president of Botswana.
</P>
<P>
The Facilitator's office was sealed and his staff dispersed,
Kabila said.
</P>
<P>
The Kabila Government earlier said that it has no longer any
confidence in Masire, the OAU-appointed Facilitator, and asked the
OAU to re-appoint a new and neutral facilitator. However, the
Security Council has since asked the Kinshasa Government to fully
cooperate with Masire.
</P>
<P>
The fighting in Kisangani resulted in the death of more than
600 civilians and more than 3,000 were wounded. The shelling of
Kisangani also destroyed the premises of the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) in Kinshasa and wounded United Nations
staff members.
</P>
<P>
"The members of the Council deplored these events," the
statement said. "They called on all parties to facilitator the
delivery of humanitarian aid."

<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, June 22 (Xinhua)-- Spain's Prime Minister Jose Maria
Aznar will begin on Sunday an official journey to China .
</P>
<P>
Aznar, first head of Government of European Union (EU) who is
to visit China follwing signing of Lisbon accord between EU and
this Asian country, will put in practice the commitment taken on
in 1998 by the 15 community members.
</P>
<P>
Regarding bilateral relations, Spain's government considers
strategic to take advantage of the "irreversible" process of China
's economic aperture to give Spain's presence impulse not only in
the area of political relations and on economic terrain, but also
in cultural and artistic fields.
</P>
<P>
In this sense, the Government has promoted celebration in
Beijing of an exhibition of Salvador Dali's work and, together
with General Society of Authors, has helped for ballet dancer
Joaquin Cortes to act at Century theater in China's capital due to
Aznar's visit.
</P>
<P>
 About 200 entrepreneurs of different sectors will also go to
China to ease the current negative rate of Spain's trade with
China and relaunch insufficient investments on China's market.
</P>
<P>
Aznar will visit in China, the capital of Beijing, Tianjin,
Shangai and Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Accused of Tarnishing Uganda's Name </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Uganda Thursday accused Rwanda of
tarnishing the name of its army and the country by displaying
Ugandan soldiers captured during the six-day fighting between
Rwandan and Ugandan forces in northern Congolese city of Kisangani
in early June.
</P>
<P>
James Wapakabulo, chairman of National Coordination Committee
on the Region, told a press conference that as part of the
demilitarization plan for Kisangani, Ugandan forces "lent" 216
officers and soldiers to the U.N. Observer team in Congo (MONUC)
as an interim measure for security arrangements of Kisangani
pending arrival of the U.N. forces.
</P>
<P>
Some of the soldiers were missing during the attack by Rwandan
army two weeks ago, said Wapakabulo, adding "MONUC has been asked
to account for their where-about.
</P>
<P>
"Since these matters involved MONUC, it had been agreed that
the accounting for the soldiers of the Uganda People's Defence
Forces (UPDF) be handled quietly behind the scenes and the process
has been on going," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is unfortunate the government of Rwanda has chosen to go
public, and it is our view that is intended to tarnish the name of
the UPDF and the country as a whole," he said.
</P>
<P>
The forces of the two former allies have left Kisangani under
the supervision of the MONUC following the latest fighting in the
city.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan and Rwandan troops, which back rival rebel factions
fighting against the Democratic Republic of the Congo President
Laurent Kabila, started to shell each other on June 5 in
Kisangani. The six-day fighting killed over 200 civilians and
wounded more than 1,000 others.

<HEADLINE> WFP Urges More Attention to Kenyan Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP)
Thursday appealed to the international community for more food aid
to drought- stricken Kenya.
</P>
<P>
"Kenya has appealed for 150,000 tons of food aid for the next
six months, up to now donors have indicated to provide only 20 to
25 percent of that amount," Manuel Silva, the WFP Regional
Humanitarian Coordinator for the drought, told a press conference
in the Kenyan capital Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
It is "very dry" in northern Kenya and pastoralists are forced
to move further north with their cattle into Ethiopia to get
better pasture, he said after winding up his five-nation tour,
which took him to Ethiopia, Somalia, Eritrea, Djibouti and Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Kenya has not got much attention from the mass
media, Silva noted.
</P>
<P>
The prolonged drought in the Horn of Africa is affecting about
10 million Ethiopians, 2.2 million Kenyans, 750,000 Somalis,
335,000 Eritreans and 10,000 Djiboutis.

<HEADLINE> Bashar's Presidential Candidacy to Be Reviewed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- A special committee will be formed
to study Syrian ruling Baath party's nomination of Bashar al-Assad,
the second son of late President Hafez al-Assad, for president,
said the country's parliament speaker Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The committee, to be formed in the Sunday session of the
People's Council (parliament), will group representatives from the
ruling Baath party, other parties and independents, Speaker Abdel
Kader Kaddura announced.
</P>
<P>
Kaddura told a press conference that the committee will present
its report to the parliament for debate and vote on Monday, and
parliament members will fix the date for a nationwide presidential
referendum on Bashar's presidential candidacy.
</P>
<P>
The referendum was likely to be held a week after the parliament
accepts the Baath party's nomination of Bashar, said the speaker.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Bashar was brought up in the family of a
veteran Arab politician, and struggled with other members of the
Baath party in a way that made him well qualified for leading the
country.
</P>
<P>
Kaddura said that the leadership of Baath party will hold a
meeting to assign tasks to each members and elect a secretary to
take care of its day-to-day affairs.
</P>
<P>
Twelve of its 21 members of the leadership are new faces.
Kaddura said that bringing new blood into the Baath leadership is
an important indicator of the development and evolution of the
party.
</P>
<P>
The Baath party elected Bashar as its secretary general and
nominated him for the presidency on Tuesday. Earlier, Bashar had
been promoted to the rank of general and declared commander of
Syria's armed forces.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon, U.N. Finish Verifying Israel's Border Violation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 22 (Xinhua) -- A joint team of Lebanon and the
United Nations Thursday finished their work of verifying Israel's
border violation, local media reported.
</P>
<P>
An officer of United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL),
requesting anonymity, said each side has submitted a report to
their respective authorities, but he refused to give more detail of
the report, local radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Local press Thursday credited U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
with "wresting a pledge" from Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak to
end encroachments on the Lebanese border in 36 hours.
</P>
<P>
Annan's loudly trumpeted feat coincided with a formal Lebanese
notice to the command of the U.N. peace-keeping force that it
should not deploy in the Israeli-vacated zone in south Lebanon
before all border violations are terminated.
</P>
<P>
Annan vowed during his meeting with Lebanese leaders that the U.
N. will "deal with the border violations seriously" and mention it
when he met with Barak.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon accuses Israel of still occupying 16 points of its
border.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon is also dissatisfied with the "blue line" (the U.N.-
marked line of the Israeli withdrawal), saying it does not accord
with the international recognized border between Lebanon and
Israel.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Occupation of Northern Cyprus an Anachronism: Cyprus Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus government spokesman
Michalis Papapetrou said here Thursday Turkey must understand that
the continuing Turkish occupation of Cyprus' northern areas is an
anachronism.
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou made the remarks as Turkish President Ahmet Necdet
Sezer started a two-day visit to the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
area in northern Cyprus at the invitation of Turkish Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
"Maintaining the Turkish occupation and the absence of a
solution in Cyprus, which run contrary to international law and
order, are an anachronism," Papapetrou said.
</P>
<P>
This, he pointed out, is also "against the interests of the
Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities."
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou said this is the message the Cyprus government wants
to send to the Turkish leadership.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Since then Turkey has maintained some 35,000 troops there with
the claimed aim of protecting the Turkish Cypriot minority.
</P>
<P>
In 1983 Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared a breakaway
republic which is only recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
According to local media, President Sezer, accompanied by State
Minister Sukru Sina Gurel and Foreign Minister Ismail Cem, arrived
in northern Cyprus at midday Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Involvement in Failed Bomb Attack on Baghdad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Hamid Reza Asefi on Thursday denied an Iraqi allegation that Tehran
is behind a failed bomb attack on Baghdad early this month.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said the Islamic Republic of Iran has not had any
involvement in the alleged bomb attack on Baghdad and strongly
rejects such a claim by Iraqi officials, the Iranian state
television reported.
</P>
<P>
He also urged Iraqi officials not to blame others for their
internal problems.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad on Thursday issued a statement claiming that four men,
including an Iranian intelligence officer, were killed in Baghdad
early this month when they were planning to launch a bomb attack.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the four were preparing a car to be used as a
rocket launcher when it accidentally exploded and killed them.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi television on Wednesday night showed footage of charred
bodies and a photo of Iranian Intelligence officer Hussein
Karamati, identified by the security office as the organizer of the
attack.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has all pieces of evidence to prove that the Iranian
intelligence agencies are involved in the planning and preparation
of such a disgraceful act, and reserves the right to retaliate
against those who attack its people, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Iraq, who fought a bloody war in 1980-88, accused each
other in recent months of launching mortar attacks and sabotage
operations. Both Tehran and Baghdad host opposition groups of the
other.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Iranian Intelligence Ministry said on Thursday
seven members of the Iraq-based Iranian opposition Mujaheddin Khalq
Organization (MKO) were killed and several others injured recently
in the western border provinces.
</P>
<P>
In a statement broadcast by the state television, the ministry
said the MKO launched three cross-border operations but were
defeated by Iranian armed forces and people.
</P>
<P>
During the clashes, an Iranian was also killed, the statement
added.
</P>
<P>
The MKO, a famous political-military group which fought against
the former Iranian shah regime, was outlawed in 1981 and fled into
Iraq due to sharp differences with the Iranian government.
</P>
<P>
The MKO, labeled by Iran as a "terrorist group," has launched a
series of cross-border attacks inside Iran in recent years,
including assassinating senior Iranian officials.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Senate Backs Plan to Arm Swiss Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss Senate has overwhelmingly
approved a proposal to arm Swiss soldiers on foreign peace
enforcement missions, according to a Swiss Radio International
report.
</P>
<P>
The vote was in line with government proposals, already
approved by the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Swiss contingents are currently deployed in Bosnia-Herzegovina
and Kosovo to provide support in logistics and infrastructure
projects. For the time being, Swiss soldiers can only carry side-
arms, but the Senate's decision on Wednesday would allow them to
be equipped with heavier weapons.
</P>
<P>
However, the senate stressed that any peacekeeping mission
involving Swiss soldiers should be mandated by either the United
Nations or the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
The government and House of Representatives had suggested that
deployment could be at the request of warring parties.
</P>
<P>
The Senate also approved this year's armament budget of 1,178
million Swiss francs (about 720 million U.S. dollars), which
covers the purchase of 186 Swedish-made CV-9030 armored personnel
carriers.

<HEADLINE> Report Finds Record Number of U.N. Volunteers Served in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNTIED NATIONS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- More than 4,000 people
served with the United Nations Volunteer (UNV) program last year --
the highest total to date, according to the program's 1999 annual
report Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In its report, titled "Getting to the People," the program
said that the record 4,383 mid-career professionals who served as
UNVs were engaged in development work and in the expanding areas
of electoral support and humanitarian relief.
</P>
<P>
They represented 149 nationalities and worked in 139 countries,
on tasks ranging from ballot preparation in East Timor to
reconstruction in Kosovo, a Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
The UNV program was created by the General Assembly in 1970 to
serve as an operational partner in development cooperation at the
request of the U.N. Member States. It is unique within the U.N.
family and as an international volunteer undertaking. It reports
to the U.N. Development Program (UNDP) and works through UNDP's
country offices around the world.
</P>
<P>
Since 1971, more than 20,000 UNVs from some 150 developing and
industrialized nations have worked in about 140 countries.
Currently, 70 percent are citizens of developing countries while
30 percent come from the industrialized world.

<HEADLINE> France to Propose Sanctions on Financial Delinquencies at G8 Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- France will propose sanctions
against the countries which refuse to cooperate in fighting
financial delinquencies, such as money laundering, at the Group of
Eight (G8) summit to be held in July in Okinawa, Japan.
</P>
<P>
French Finance Minister Laurent Fabius said on Thursday that
France would do its best to make the G8 summit adopt such measures,
and will host on October 17 a meeting of finance ministers,
interior ministers and justice ministers of European countries on
the measures against tax havens sheltering financial criminal
activities.
</P>
<P>
``We are engaged for several years in the fight against money
laundering and we will do our best to have sanctions against those
countries which don't respect the normal international rules,''
said Fabius.
</P>
<P>
The Group of Financial Action Against Money Laundering
published on Thursday a list of 15 countries which refuse to
cooperate in the fight against money laundering and 14 other
countries which little cooperate.
</P>
<P>
The Paris-based group, which is membered by 26 industrialized
countries and is affiliated to the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD), said that on the list are
Israel, the Philippines, Liechtenstein, Lebanon, Russia, the
Bahamas, Cayman Islands, Cook Islands, the Dominican Republic,
Marshall Islands, Nauru Niue, Panama, St. Christopher and Nevis,
St. Vincent and Grenada.
</P>
<P>
Fabius said that financial sanctions to be proposed by France
could go as far as cutting financial relations with the countries
on ``the black list.''
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a French parliament mission of information on
financial crimes Wednesday published a report accusing Monaco of
serving as an offshore center for money-laundering.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Thursday met behind closed doors to discuss the latest development
in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The meeting, briefed by the U.N. Secretariat, came after
Rwandan and Ugandan forces have left the northeastern town of
Kisangani, the diamond trade center in the DRC, and the DRC
Government, headed by President Laurent Kabila, said Wednesday
that it was shutting down an effort by the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) to open a political discourse among warring factions
in the central African country.
</P>
<P>
The Kinshasa offices of the OAU-appointed mediator, Ketumile
Masire, who is former president of Botswana, were sealed and his
staff dispersed, Kabila was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The current phase of fighting in DRC began a year after Kabila
took power in 1997. Since then, fighting has involved armies of
six African nations and several rebel groups.

The Financial Times reported Thursday that BP Amoco had agreed
to acquire the stake when the Chinese company launches an initial
public offering this summer.
</P>
<P>
The British oil giant plans to buy a 2.2 percent stake in
Sinopec. The move follows its purchase of a 2.2 percent stake in
PetrocChina, the leading Chinese oil company, for about 620
million US dollars in its flotation last April.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that BP Amoco sees the fast growing China
market as one of the main battlegrounds among the big
multinational oil companies over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
With the Sinopec and PetroChina deals, BP Amoco hopes to kick-
start its drive for a significant retail and marketing presence in
China, the Financial Times said.

<HEADLINE> UK Manufacturing Export Orders Continue to Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 22 (Xinhua) - UK manufacturing exports continued
to fall in June, with orders from overseas hitting their lowest
level for a year.
</P>
<P>
Output expectations remained negative in the month after having
been positive in the nine months leading up to May, according to
the Confederation of British Industry's latest monthly survey of
industrial trends.
</P>
<P>
The CBI said 48 percent of manufacturers reported that their
export order books were below normal against only 9 percent
enjoying better than normal demand.
</P>
<P>
"Exporters are continuing to suffer from the strength of
sterling, despite the easing of the exchange rate over the past
month," said CBI director general Digby Jones.
</P>
<P>
"Export orders cannot be regained in just a few weeks... many
companies still regard the current rate against the euro as
uncompetitive," he said.
</P>
<P>
The CBI said manufacturers also had a gloomy outlook on the
volume of output over the next four months, with expectations
falling to the lowest level since March 1999.

<HEADLINE> New High-capacity Mini Hard Drive to Be Introduced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 22 (Xinhua) -- A mew mini hard drive with a
storage capacity of a billion bytes of information will be
commercially introduced this September, IBM announced this week.
</P>
<P>
The tiny Microdrive, which is the size of a book of matches, is
a milestone in the evolution of magnetic storage, IBM executives
said, because it surpasses the same one-gigabyte barrier the
company's original refrigerator-sized hard drive surmounted in the
1980's.
</P>
<P>
The first 340-megabyte Microdrive introduced a year ago had a
storage density of 5.04 billion bits a square inch, while the
current drive has increased that density to 15.2 billion bits a
square inch.
</P>
<P>
The higher density means the tiny new drive is within 10
percent of the most advanced IBM storage products now on the
market, the company said. A one-gigabyte drive could hold up to 1,
000 high-resolution photographs, a thousand 200-page novels, or
nearly 10 hours of high-quality digital audio music.
</P>
<P>
IBM expected about one-third of the market for the new drives
to be as storage devices for digital cameras. Another third of the
market would come as backup and data-transfer media for notebook
and desktop computers.
</P>
<P>
But in the future the Microdrive will be put into hand-held
computing devices like persona digital assistants and advanced
digital cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the new hard drive has the ability to resist a
1500-G shock, that is equivalent to a drop from a normal office
desk onto a medium-thickness carpet.

<HEADLINE> U.N.Says HIV/AIDS Epidemic Shifting From Cities to Rural Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a new publication entitled Sustainable Agriculture/Rural
Development and Vulnerability to the AIDS Epidemic, FAO and UNAIDS
called upon governments to pay more attention to the real burden
of HIV/AIDS on local communities and to ensure that rural
development also aims at combating the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
"HIV/AIDS is not only a health but also a development problem,"
FAO and UNAIDS said.
</P>
<P>
The report says it is urgent to address rural HIV prevention
and care needs. Though HIV prevalence is rising in rural areas,
the infrastructure needed for prevention programs -- counseling
and testing, condom availability and AIDS information -- is less
developed.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, health facilities are often inadequate in rural
communities, which bear the main burden of care for people with
HIV, and many HIV infected people return from the cities to their
villages when they fall ill, the report says.
</P>
<P>
Rural families provide most of the care For AIDS patients, the
households mostly bear the costs for food, medicine and funeral
expenses, and agricultural development policies rarely take this
fact into consideration, the report says.
</P>
<P>
"Rural HIV often remains silent and invisible," according to
the report, because of poor health infrastructure, restricted
access to health facilities and inadequate surveillance.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, HIV in rural population often remains "an
unknown entity for policy-makers and development planners," says
the report.
</P>
<P>
Where people are exposed to poverty, food insecurity, gender
inequality, migration, war and civil conflict, their vulnerability
to HIV increases, and in rural areas of most developing countries,
the spread of HIV is accelerated by migration, trade, the movement
of refugees and strengthened rural-urban linkages, FAO and UNAIDS
said.
</P>
<P>
The report mentions two types of rural areas particularly
vulnerable to HIV: those along truck routes and those that are
sources of migrant labor to urban areas.
</P>
<P>
According to UNAIDS, an estimated 33.6 million people were
living with HIV/AIDS at the end of 1999, of which over 90 percent
were in developing countries. Africa, which accounts for only one
tenth of the world's population, bears the brunt of the epidemic
with more than 80 percent of all deaths to date. In Asia, HIV
seropositivity rates are still comparatively low but the spread of
the pandemic is rapid. Almost 6 million people are believed to be
infected with HIV.

<HEADLINE> African Leaders Agree to Promote Peace, Economic Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 22 (Xinhua) -- African leaders Thursday
agreed that peace and economic integration are essential to launch
the continent into the global market successfully and to make the
African economic booming a reality.
</P>
<P>
"There is an urgent need to review the question of conflict on
the continent," South African President Thabo Mbeki said at the
World Economic Forum's (WEF's) 10th annual southern African
economic summit meeting held in South Africa's port city of
Durban.
</P>
<P>
The summit was organized by the WEF and the Southern African
Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said African leaders must look for ways to assist each
other in maintaining peace and stability to show the international
community that Africa is not a hopeless continent.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that African leaders should do more to discourage
conflict on the continent and ensure economic development.
</P>
<P>
African leaders, especially those in southern Africa, must
speed up the integration of their economies, he added.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Southern African Free Trade Agreement must be
concluded and enforced before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican President and Chairman of the SADC Joachim Chissano
agreed with Mbeki, saying Africans have to begin to live, instead
of just surviving.
</P>
<P>
SADC's Executive Secretary Prega Ramsamy stressed the need for
Africa to move forward into the mainstream of the global economy.
</P>
<P>
"Already steps have been taken to improve macro-economic
fundamentals of the individual countries and of the region in
which we live. But, more needs to be done," Ramsamy said.

<P>
He said a lot of Africans have no access to a formal classroom,
let alone to self-employment.
</P>
<P>
As a result, African countries have a large pool of human
resource that lacks adequate and modern training facilities and is
also not employed, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA June 22 (Xinhua) -- A top Zambian government official
Thursday urged member states of the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) to come up with a strategy to help market
the meteorological departments in the region.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Communications and Transport Minister Nkandu Luo made
the call when she addressed directors of meteorological
departments from COMESA countries.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the Zambian government had invested very
little in the meteorological department rendering it to be one of
the worst funded departments.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Luo said it was sad to note that the meteorological
departments had done little to market themselves.
</P>
<P>
"If you had marketed yourselves, we would have known you. The
way you give us information is important and the way you present
yourselves when predicting the weather forecast on TV leaves much
to be desired," she said.
</P>
<P>
Luo noted that the weather forecast was extremely important as
it affected agriculture and tourism, which plays an important role
in the countries' economic development.
</P>
<P>
She also urged governments of the member states to utilize the
information offered by the departments to avoid certain calamities
such as flooding and drought.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, Nigeria Get Most of Foreign Direct Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 22 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and Nigeria
were getting the lion's share of the 2.1 billion U.S. dollars in
foreign direct investment (FDI) that was flowing into Africa, it
was disclosed on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Much of the region's investment activity was split "westwards
where there is a heavy concentration of oil and gas" and that the
bulk of Africa' s FDI was centered around these resources, Anthony
Hawkins, head of the MBA program at the University of Zimbabwe,
said at the World Economic Forum's Southern African Development
Summit in Durban.
</P>
<P>
Paul Laudicina, vice president and managing director of U.S.
firm A.T. Kearney, said global FDI had increased four-fold during
the 1990s to a staggering sum of 850 billion dollars and that the
share that had been apportioned to the emerging markets had
averaged around 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
There had also been a steady decline in FDI in emerging markets
over the past two years, he added.
</P>
<P>
Laudicina said investors were less tolerant of risk in emerging
markets than in developed countries, adding that Africa was
perceived as the riskiest region by investors.
</P>
<P>
Hawkins said he saw investor confidence in Africa waning
because of the high costs of labor as well as geopolitical and
macro-economic instability in the region.
</P>
<P>
But interestingly, those that had invested in Africa had met
higher profitability targets than those who had invested in
Southeast Asia, according to Laudicina.
</P>
<P>
Informed investors did not regard the Southern African
Development Community as an important driver of investment but
rather as a "dream not a reality", he said.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho's Minister of Finance and Development Planning Kelebone
Maope told the summit that the region did not have the necessary
infrastructure skills and human capital to address the skills
shortage that were so vital for FDI.
</P>
<P>
He urged more educational assistance and funding for the
region.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Shas Party Decides to Remain in Ruling Coalition EDS-2nd lead-writethru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Israel's ultra-Orthodox Shas
party withdrew its resignation from Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
coalition government on Thursday and said it would stay in the
government.
</P>
<P>
"The Council of Torah Sages has ordered Shas to withdraw its
resignation letters," Council secretary Rafael Pinhasi told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The Council is the supreme decision-making body of Shas, which
has 17 seats in the 120-member Knesset (parliament), and thus is
the biggest coalition partner of Barak's One Israel party.
</P>
<P>
In protest against the government's failure to meet Shas'
demands for more school funding and control as well as the
legalization of its pirate radio stations, the Council last week
instructed the Shas ministers to resign.
</P>
<P>
This move plunged the 11-month-old Barak government into an "
unprecedented crisis." Barak started intensive negotiations in
efforts to prevent Shas from quitting the coalition, as he is in
dire need of Shas' support for any peace deal he may reach with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The crisis deteriorated Tuesday when the Shas ministers
submitted their letters of resignation, leaving Barak only 48 hours
of maneuvering in order to save the floundering coalition from
collapse.
</P>
<P>
The left-wing Meretz party, Shas' arch-rival, Wednesday evening
made a concession to leave the coalition, paving the way for Shas
ministers to rescind their resignation decision.
</P>
<P>
Meretz, a staunch supporter of the peace process, has vowed to
continue backing Barak in the Knesset and said they made the
sacrifice so as to bolster the government's peace efforts with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Shas' decision to stay raised the expectations that the
religious party could back Barak in his future efforts to seal a
deal with the Palestinians in return for the satisfaction of their
demands.
</P>
<P>
However, Shas political leaders so far have refrained from
pledging unreserved support for Barak in the peace process. They
say that their support for any and all peace deals is not assured.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have now entered a critical
stage with a September target date for a peace treaty looming. The
two sides have been trying to work out a framework deal to guide
the settlement of the thorniest final-status issues that include
the fate of Jerusalem, the future of settlements, borders, water
resources and refugees.
</P>
<P>
They also have to solve the interim issues, which include the
final redeployment of Israeli forces in the West Bank and the
release of Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Feeling a strong sense of urgency as time is running out, Barak
who used to be reluctant to attend a three-way summit with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton,
is now calling for an early meeting to help bridge the wide gaps
between the Israeli and Palestinian positions.
</P>
<P>
He is also ready to make "painful concessions" in order to
clinch a deal with the Palestinians. So far, no substantial
progress has been achieved in the interim negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Barak has sought to delay the third redeployment in the West
Bank and make it part of the framework agreement. Arafat, however,
insists on settling the interim issues first.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians, after being assured by the Americans that
Israel would implement the interim accords, have also agreed to a
two-week postponement for the final Israeli redeployment in the
West Bank originally due Friday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is scheduled to
return to the region next week in a bid to narrow gaps and set the
stage for a possible last-ditch Barak-Arafat-Clinton three-way
summit.
</P>
<P>
Now that the government crisis is now over, it is far from
certain that Shas would live up to Barak's hope to support his
future peace deals with the Palestinians and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Barak told members of his One Israel Party on Thursday that the
emerging government, with Shas in his coalition, is the most
comfortable for advancing government policy.
</P>
<P>
Barak said the Meretz faction of the Knesset, even if not a
coalition member, is a natural partner of the government and can be
expected to support its policy.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said having Shas as a coalition partner and
Meretz's support from the outside represented the best possible
deal for his government.
</P>
<P>
Meretz party leader, and former Education Minister Yossi Sarid
Thursday said that now Shas must act appropriately as a member of
the government. He also said he expects to see Shas vote next week
in favor of transferring control of the Arab village Abu Dis
outside Jerusalem to full Palestinian control, and against a bill
to dissolve the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Whether and how long Barak's new coalition can stand the harder
tests ahead remains to be seen. As Israeli-Palestinian peace talks
move ahead, tough decisions will have to be made, which may cause
new rifts in the already shaky coalition.

<HEADLINE> Iran Seizes over 60 Tons of Narcotics in 3 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRNA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Iran seized over 60 tons of
various narcotics in the first three months of the current Iranian
calendar year which started on March 20, a commander of the
security
forces announced on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Sari, the northern Mazadaran province, Brigadier
General Mohsen Ansari said the amount is 13 tons higher compared
with the same period of the last Iranian calendar year.
</P>
<P>
He said 80 percent of the drugs were seized in the eastern
provinces, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Ansari said Iran has stepped up its security deployment in
the eastern and central provinces of Kerman, Sistan-Baluchestan and
Khorasan and special police dogs will be deployed in 10 cities
across the country to patrol some public places against drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Some 5,000 tons of narcotics are produced in Afghanistan
annually and because of the proximity, some of the drug cache finds
its way to Iran, the commander said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that due to the drought in Afghanistan, the
migration of Afghans to Iran is on a rise and some Afghan
immigrants carry drugs in their bags.
</P>
<P>
Iran is a main transit route for drugs smuggled from neighboring
Pakistan and Afghanistan, the world's largest opium producer, to
Europe and oil-rich Gulf Arab states.
</P>
<P>
It started strict anti-drug campaigns in 1989 after the Iranian
Majlis (parliament) passed an anti-drug law authorizing capital
punishment for drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
An Iranian official said last month that over 262 tons of
various narcotics were seized in the country in the past Iranian
year that ended on March 19.
</P>
<P>
A total of 185 Iranian anti-drug forces were killed in the year
in clashes with drug traffickers, bringing the total number since
the 1979 Islamic revolution to 3,000.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's second naval base --
Jinnah Naval Base at Ormara in southwestern province of
Balochistan was inaugurated Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The new naval base, 240 kilometers to the west of the port city
of Karachi, was completed at a cost of 4.5 billion rupees (849
million U.S. dollars) and will provide berthing facilities to
eight ships and four submarines, reported the News Network

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Export Posts 7 Percent Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's export earnings rose to
4.59 billion U.S. dollars in the first 10 months of the current
fiscal year (1999-2000), posting a seven percent rise, according
to an official handout released at a review meeting of the Export
Promotion Bureau (EPB) Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Commerce Minister Abdul Jalil said at the meeting that leather,
other primary commodities, raw jute, knitwear, frozen food and
petroleum products exceeded the export targets during the July-
April period of the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
In the current fiscal year, some 155 private and eight state-
owned enterprises took part in 23 international fairs as part of
the country's market expansion program, according to the meeting
sources.
</P>
<P>
The commerce minister asked the EPB to set up display centers
in Bangladesh missions abroad so that foreign buyers could easily
have a first-hand idea about Bangladeshi products.
</P>
<P>
Steps to open websites in potential markets worldwide will be
taken to boost export, he said, adding that Bangladesh missions
abroad would be used in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Jalil Urged the private sector to take a lead in the market
expansion program, saying "boosting the export should be the
priority while taking part in international trade fairs."

<HEADLINE> Russia Warns U.S. It May Pull Out of Medium-Range Missile Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 22 (Xinhua) -- A top Russian military officer
warned here Thursday that his country may withdraw from the Medium-
Range Missile Treaty and resume the development of medium and
medium-short range missiles If the U.S. builds missile defense
systems.
</P>
<P>
Russia will strongly react to the deployment of the U.S.
national missile defense (NMD) system, said Col. Gen. Vladimir
Yakovlev, Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Strategic Missile
Force (SMF) at a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
"The step (Russia's pullout of the Medium-Range Missile Treaty)
is possible as part of Moscow's asymmetrical response to
Washington's withdrawal from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM)
treaty," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Russia has the technological potential for developing a medium
and theater missile group. It's very simple because their
production is a component of the existing production of missile
carriers," Yakovlev said.
</P>
<P>
"The production of such missiles will come much cheaper than
that of intercontinental ballistic missiles," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he stressed that it is necessary to unite Russia's
nuclear triad of land, sea and air components under one command
for rapid and effective reaction to possible steps by the U.S..
</P>
<P>
"This issue has already been coordinated: all the necessary
scientific, economic, military and technical grounds have been
prepared," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the third and next SMF regiment equipped with ten of
the newest intercontinental ballistic Topol-M missiles will enter
combat duty in 2000, Yakovlev said.
</P>
<P>
The first two such missile regiments have come into combat duty
respectively in 1998 and 1999, he added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Zimbabwe's Ruling, Opposition Parties To Rival In Elections (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Zhu Shixiang
</P>
<P>
HARARE, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabweans will go to the polls on
Saturday and Sunday to choose their fifth parliament, which is
undoubtedly the most eye-catching election in this southern
African nation.
</P>
<P>
Unlike previous elections, President Robert Mugabe's ruling
Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (Zanu-pf) this
year faces stiff competition from the labor backed Movement for
Democratic Change (MDC) led by Morgan Tsvangirai, who is former
General-Secretary of the Congress of the Trade Unions.
</P>
<P>
In this year's election, at least 550 candidates from 15
political parties and 92 independent candidates will fight it out
in the 120 contested constituencies. Under the constitution,
Mugabe chooses 30 non- constituency members of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Only Zanu-pf and MDC have fielded candidates in every
constituency for the election in which one of the two would emerge
the victor.
</P>
<P>
The election has drawn much attention from the international
scene with many foreign organizations willing to come and observe
it.
</P>
<P>
Zanu-pf Deputy Secretary for Publicity and Information Chen
Chimutengwende, who is also Information Minister of the
government, said the MDC and its allies are only bent on removing
Zanu-pf from power rather than dealing with the country's social
and economic problems.
</P>
<P>
President Mugabe, who is also Zanu-pf's first Secretary, said
that his party would not be fighting MDC in the election, but
would be squaring against the British.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said, "Britain is sponsoring the MDC." "The MDC has no
history. It is unknown to the people and has no track record. The
people of Zimbabwe who have seen a revolution unfolding cannot
vote for these insignificant nobodies," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zanu-pf which has been in power for 20 years is seeking yet
another mandate to make up for its shortcomings especially on the
land issue.
</P>
<P>
The party also pursues an indigenization policy so that more
blacks would own factories, mines and other businesses.
</P>
<P>
According to its election manifesto launched by Mugabe in May,
Zanu-pf's theme is that "Land is the economy and economy is the
land".
</P>
<P>
In order to get more support from people in the rural areas,
the Mugabe administration issued a preliminary notice early this
month to compulsorily acquire 804 white farms for resettlement.
</P>
<P>
The government requires 5 million hectares of land to resettle
 thousands of its landless people.

<TEXT>
<P>
The MDC, which was formed nine months ago, said Zanu-pf's bad
rule had resulted in widespread unemployment. It will create more
jobs should it win the election.
</P>
<P>
The Zanu-pf has been the ruling party since independence from
Britain in 1980. It has made great achievements in the fields of
health, education and social welfare for the majority of poor
Zimbabweans over the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
But these gains have since been affected by economic reforms
introduced in the early 1990s under the encouragement of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF). This led to steep rise in the
cost of living which has left many people suffering.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Zanu-pf is facing serious economic difficulties
because the World Bank and the IMF refuse to offer aid to it. To
grave the situation, all donor countries followed suit.
</P>
<P>
In the past four parliamentary elections, Zanu-pf got most of
the support from people in the rural areas. It has expressed the
hope to draw support from the same group of people in the
elections at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
But its popularity in cities and towns has declined because of
the country's poor economic situation. The MDC is expected to take
advantage of this to gain more votes in the cities and towns.
</P>
<P>
Out of a population of 12.5 million people, 5.1 million are
registered, among which about 70 percent live in the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The Zanu-pf began armed struggle in the 1970s, which finally
led the country to independence. It initiated a massive
construction program after independence, which saw many hospitals,
schools and dams built.
</P>
<P>
Most analysts here predict that the Zanu-pf will win the
election while the MDC will become the largest opposition party in
the new Parliament.
</P>
<P>
They added that the new Parliament would have to make radical
decisions to solve problems facing the country.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the likely change to its composition, the new
Parliament is expected to deal first with the controversial land
issue. It also needs to see to boosting the country's economic
development, fighting corruption and political violence.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Top Legislator Meets Azerbaijani Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAKU, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese top legislator Li
Peng met Thursday with Azerbaijani Prime Minister Artur Tair Rasi-
Zade.
</P>
<P>
Li said China highly praised Azerbaijan's plan to build the "
New Silk Road," a trading route which links Asia and Europe via
Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of the Standing Committee of the Chinese National
People's Congress, said the two economies are highly complementary
and that the two countries have great potential for cooperation in
areas of oil, household appliance manufacturing and farm produce
processing.
</P>
<P>
As the railway linking China's Xinjiang autonomous region and
Kazakhstan has opened to traffic, Eastern, Central and Western
Asia are now connected, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The "New Silk Road" has therefore taken shape and the question
is how to utilize this transport resource effectively. The two
sides might explore new ways of cooperation on the "New Silk Road,
" Li added.
</P>
<P>
On the Nagorno-Karabakh issue, he said China supports
Azerbaijan's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
"China does not recognize Nagorno-Karabakh as an independent
state, nor the legitimacy of the just-ended parliamentary election
in that area."
</P>
<P>
Li, who had studied and worked in Azerbaijan before, said, "Now,
several decades later, I come here again and find everything
intimate."
</P>
<P>
For his part, Rasi-Zade said, "The Azerbaijani people know your
name very well and they look forward to your visit."
</P>
<P>
China is one of the countries which first recognized
Azerbaijan's independence, the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said Azerbaijan sticks to its "one China" Policy.
</P>
<P>
Rasi-Zade said his country hopes China can take part in the
exploitation of Caspian Sea oil. Azerbaijan also hopes to
cooperate with China in the building of the "New Silk Road", he
said.
</P>
<P>
Li is on a six-nation tour, which has already taken him to
Yugoslavia, Slovenia, Croatia and Slovakia. He will also tour
Ukraine.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Clone Second Goat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have cloned a
second goat from adult goat body cells, following the death of the
world's first cloned goat 36 hours after its birth.
</P>
<P>
The scientists, at the Northwest University of Agriculture and
Forestry Science and Technology, in this capital of Shaanxi
Province, also performed the operation which produced the first
cloned goat on June 16.
</P>
<P>
The second goat, named "Yangyang", is 33.5-cm long and 29.5-cm
tall, and weighs 2.6 kg. It was born at 20:00 pm today.
</P>
<P>
"Yuanyuan", the first cloned goat, died from respiratory
failure stemming from undeveloped lungs, according to the
university.
</P>
<P>
In cloning the goats, the Chinese scientists adopted a
technique of nuclear transfer which is different from that used to
produce Dolly the sheep, the world's first cloned animal, born in
1997 in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
From December 1999 to January this year, scientists removed
some cells from the ears of an adult goat and collected some goat
oocytes from a slaughterhouse, and cultivated them for future use.
</P>
<P>
They later injected the nucleus of the donor cells into an
enucleated oocyte to develop into embryos, which were then
implanted in the surrogate mother goat.
</P>
<P>
Yangyang and Yuanyuan, both female, were cloned from cells of
the same goat, which made them resemble each other. Researchers
will soon carry out a genetic analysis of Yangyang.

<HEADLINE> Bill on Surrogacy Still in Dispute Among Legco Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Surrogacy, pregnancy by artificial insemination or surgical
implantation of a fertilized egg, is a very complicated and
sensitive issue, said the Secretary for Health and Welfare E.K.
Yeoh, in response to the committee stage amendments moved to the
Human Reproductive Technology Bill in the Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
"We understand that some people may not accept this matter
because of various reasons including religious or ethical
considerations," Yeoh said.
</P>
<P>
"However, we must admit that in some circumstances surrogacy is
the only hope for a couple to have their own biological child e.g.
the woman's womb is removed because of disease," Yeoh stressed.
</P>
<P>
In view of the availability of the enabling reproductive
technology, it is imperative to consider giving these couples a
fair chance to have their offspring, Yeoh added.
</P>
<P>
"Having said that, I must speak with assertion that we are not
encouraging surrogacy. In fact, our policy is to actively
discourage surrogacy, as evidenced in the stringent control of
surrogacy arrangement in the Human Reproductive Technology Bill,"
the secretary explained.
</P>
<P>
Law makers agreed to impose strict regulation through
legislation as there is currently no legislative control over
surrogacy, but they said they yet allow a leeway for those who
have but to resort to this option.
</P>
<P>
"In particular, we want to ensure that surrogacy on commercial
basis is strictly prohibited," they emphasized.
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, surrogacy remains a rather un-conventional option
that even many infertile couples will rarely consider. For those
who resort to this method to have their offspring, very few are
willing to discuss it openly, mainly on grounds of privacy or the
taboo nature of the subject.
</P>
<P>
They said that there will be an Ethics Committee set up under
the future Council on Reproductive Technology to, among other
things, monitor and assess the public's ethical and moral
attitudes towards surrogacy arrangements.
</P>
<P>
The Bill aims to regulate reproductive technology procedure,
use of embryos and gametes for research and other purposes, to
regulate surrogacy arrangement and to establish a Council on Human
Reproductive Technology.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of legislation is to ensure, through statutory
measures, that reproductive technology will be safely practiced
and the rights of users and children born out of reproductive
technology procedure will be duly protected.
</P>
<P>
According to the bill, the procedure will be restricted to
married couples and prohibit commercial dealing of the use of
gametes and embryos. Commercial arrangement of surrogacy should
also be an offense.
</P>
<P>
"Although there have been varying views on some controversial
subjects, we have already taken into consideration views from
majority of the community when finalizing the regulatory framework,
" Yeoh said.
</P>
<P>
One important consensus law makers have reached with the Bills
Committee in the deliberation of this Bill is that the welfare of
the child to be born should be regarded as paramount importance.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Director-General of the World
Trade Organization (WTO) Mike Moore Thursday dampened hopes for an
early new round of multilateral trade negotiations, saying member
countries still have too many differences to settle.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the World Economic Forum's 10th annual southern
African economic summit meeting, Moore hinted that ministerial
talks in Seattle, the United States, last December failed to
produce the consensus on an agenda for further negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"The truth of the matter is we failed in Seattle not because of
protests, we failed because the trans-Atlantic differences were
too great and the north-south differences were too great," Moore
said.

<P>
"There has been some movement (since then) but not enough for
me to say with confidence in the short term that we can get going
rapidly," he added.

<HEADLINE> Five Ugandan Battalions to Leave Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has decided
to withdraw five battalions of the Uganda People's Defence Forces
(UPDR) from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) back to
Uganda, the President's Office said in a press release Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made following the pull-out of UPDF units from
 Kisangani and areas around the city as part of the U.N.
supervised demilitarization plan for that zone, as well as
adjustments of their dispositions in other parts of the Congo,
said the release.
</P>
<P>
As of Wednesday, the rear elements of the forces pulling out of
 Kisangani were at Lindi Bridge, about 100 kilometers north to
Kisangani, the third largest city of the DRC, the release said.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal is being supervised by the U.N. Observer team in
the Congo, said the release, adding that other forces still
remain in other parts of the DRC in accordance with the Lusaka
cease-fire agreement signed last July.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan and Rwandan troops, based in Kisangani where they back
rival rebel factions fighting against the DRC President Laurent
Kabila, clashed two weeks ago, leaving over 200 civilians dead and
more than 1,000 others wounded.

<HEADLINE> China Requests Probe Into Deaths of Illegals in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese embassy in London has
asked the British authorities to conduct a serious investigation
into the deaths of 58 illegal immigrants and bring the masterminds
to book.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on Wednesday, the embassy said it was
informed by the British police on Tuesday that the two survivors
were initially confirmed as Chinese and the 58 victims were also
believed by police to be from China.
</P>
<P>
The bodies of 58 illegal immigrants were found in the back of a
truck at England's southern port of Dover early on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government consistently opposes human trafficking
and illegal immigration in whatever form and firmly condemns the
evil, money-motivated acts of human trafficking gangs, who pay no
heed to the victims' lives," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is willing to coordinate with all
foreign governments concerned in jointly cracking down on cross-
border human trafficking, it said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese embassy much regrets and is grieved that the
illegal immigrants readily believed what the 'snake heads' had
said and took the risk which cost them their lives. We express our
solicitude to the families of the victims," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The embassy also promised cooperation with the British side in
handling the aftermath of the incident.
</P>
<P>
The driver of the Dutch-registered truck, which arrived from
Zeebrugge, Belgium, just before midnight, has been arrested.
</P>
<P>
The dead, 54 men and four women, were in their early 20s. The
two survivors, both men, have been taken to hospital and
questioned. They admitted that they came from Fujian, China.
</P>
<P>
Suffocation was suspected for the deaths.
</P>
<P>
The truck was an airtight 18-meter-long container which was
partially loaded with fresh tomatoes. Its refrigerating unit was
not switched on and the interior temperature was high.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Special Envoy, Greek FM Discuss Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan's
special envoy Alvaro de Soto on Thursday met here with Greek
Foreign Minister George Papandreou to discuss the development of
the peace talks on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The meeting took place just ahead of the resumption of the
third round of U.N.-sponsored proximity talks between the Greek
and Turkish Cypriot communities on the divided island of Cyprus,
which was scheduled for July 5 in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Describing the meeting as "crucial and interesting," de Soto,
who arrived in Athens after his tour to Cyprus and Turkey, said he
was looking forward to the resumption of talks on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He said Annan hoped that Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash
and Cypriot President Clerides would hold talks.
</P>
<P>
He also said the U.N. is trying to find a "spherical and
comprehensive solution" to the Cyprus issue, adding that Greece
should play an important role in Cyprus' reunification efforts.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou said that this was a crucial and sensitive period
for the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-controlled
south and the Turkish Cypriots-dominated north since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Two rounds of U.N.-brokered talks between the two sides on the
island had been held previously in New York and Geneva
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Greece, along with the Greek Cypriots and the international
community, supports the reunification of Cyprus in a federation
formula, while Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots demand that a
confederation formed by two sovereign states be set up on the
Mediterranean island.

<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua)-- Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen
met here today with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
Qian said since the heads of state of China and the United
States met for the first time in Seattle eight years ago,
generally speaking Sino-U.S. relations have experienced an overall
forward momentum, despite some twists and turns.
</P>
<P>
Qian attributed the development to the concerted efforts of the
presidents, governments and peoples of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The recent telephone conversation between President Jiang Zemin
and President Bill Clinton is of notable significance for the
healthy and stable development of Sino-U.S. ties, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
He said the current China visit by the secretary of state
herself is part of the high-level contracts between the two
countries, and he believed the visit will help enhance mutual
understanding and the further development of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Albright stressed that President Clinton and the U.S.
government attach great importance to developing U.S.-China
relations. The decision made by the two presidents that the two
countries will be committed to establishing a constructive
strategic partnership has indicated the correct direction for the
development of the bilateral relations.

<P>
They also agreed to make preparations for meetings between the
two presidents during the UN Millennium Summit and the APEC
informal summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
Tang said during the talks that through the concerted efforts
of both sides, especially with the care and stimulating efforts of
the heads of two state, Sino-US relations have witnessed
improvement and development in the past few years. Not long ago,
President Jiang Zemin and President Bill Clinton exchanged views
through the hotline on bilateral relations, and this is of great
significance to the bilateral relationship, he said.
</P>
<P>
So long as both sides strictly observe the basic norms
governing international relations, including mutual respect for
national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and non-
interference in each other's internal affairs, and handle
bilateral relations with a spirit of equality, mutual benefit and
seeking common ground while preserving differences, their
relationship can undoubtedly continue to move forward, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
He said this year serves as a link between the preceding and
the following periods, and China is willing to join hands with the
US to push forward ties, in a bid to create a sound foundation for
the two countries' relationship in the new century.
</P>
<P>
Albright concurred with Tang's remarks on bilateral relations.
She said that relations with China are among the most important
foreign relations of the US government, and the hotline
conversation between the heads of the two states has shown once
again that the maintenance of regular contact between top leaders
plays an extremely important role in the bilateral relationship.
The US side is willing to work together with China for the further
progress of relations, she said.

China is determined to, and confident and capable of
safeguarding the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity,
and of realizing the complete reunification of the country, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Albright said the US sticks to the One-China Policy, abides by
its "three nos" commitment, namely, not to support Taiwan's
independence, not to support "two Chinas" or "one China, one
Taiwan", not to support Taiwan's entry into any international
organization requiring sovereign states for membership, and
opposes the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act proposed by certain US
congress members.
</P>
<P>
Tang said the Chinese side attaches great importance to the
attitude the US has made clear, and hopes that the US would take
practical measures to adhere to the One-China Policy, the three
joint communiques and the relevant commitments it has made, adding
that this is of critical importance to the further development of
bilateral relations and the stability of the Taiwan straits
situation.
</P>
<P>
Tang and Albright also exchanged views on China's permanent
normal trade relations with the US, and agreed that to conduct
cooperation in certain important sectors would help the
improvement of ties. The two highly evaluated the Sino-US
Statement on Cooperation on the Environment and Development, and
the Agreement on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters
signed recently. The Chinese side also reaffirmed its principled
stance on issues including human rights and the prevention of
nuclear proliferation.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of international security, Tang said the National
Missile Defense (NMD) system proposed by the US would have a
serious negative impact on the global strategic balance and
stability, and efforts for international arms control, disarmament
and prevention of nuclear proliferation. The Chinese side urges
the US side to earnestly respond to the international appeal and
to abandon its NMD plan as early as possible, Tang said.

To maintain a healthy and stable development of China-US

issue in accordance with the rules of the World Trade Organization
(WTO). To resolve the issue is also the basis and prerequisite to
implement the Sino-U.S. agreement on China's entry into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that it was a wise decision of the U.S. House
of Representatives to pass the PNTR issue not long ago. An early
settlement of the issue will benefit both China and the United
States.

He said that the U.S. government, the democrats and the
republicans as well as people from of various circles of the
United States have made efforts for that, and the Chinese
government spoke highly of their efforts.

But he pointed out that the relevant bill also contains
articles that try to interfere in China's internal affairs and to
damage China's interests under various kinds of pretexts. To these
the Chinese government is firmly opposed to and will not accept.

<HEADLINE> Dunhuang Heritage Protected from Moving Sand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DUNHUANG (Gansu Province), June 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese
scientists have achieved success in protecting the world-class
heritage relics in northwest China's Dunhuang from being damaged
by encroaching sand from nearby deserts.
</P>
<P>
Located at the western end of the arid Gansu Corridor, Dunhuang
's famous Mogao Grottoes with their priceless murals have long
been under threat from moving dunes from Mingsha Hill, which is
only 1,500 meters from the caves.
</P>
<P>
There have been worries that the sand might eventually bury the
1,600-year-old site, which was put on the World Heritage List by
the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization in 1987.
</P>
<P>
"Long-term research has suggested that the biggest threat is
not the moving dunes but the sand blown by the wind from Mingsha
Hill. So we have taken measures to curb it," said Wang Wanfu,
deputy director of the Conservation Institute of the Dunhuang
Academy, a center of Dunhuang studies.
</P>
<P>
A three-step project built to obstruct and fix the sand has
helped reduce the annual amount of sand invading the cave area by
70 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
The first step was to grow some desert plants at the foot of
Mingsha Hill to fix the sand. Now, a 2,000-meter-long and 12-meter-
wide shelterbelt of vegetation blocks 5,400 cubic meters of loose
sand, while reducing the wind speed by 20 percent, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The scientists adopted a system which conveys water directly to
the root of each plant through perforated pipes, to ensure the
plants survive the extremely dry environment.
</P>
<P>
Monitoring results showed that the establishment of nylon
fencing around the caves, the second step, has stopped more than
95 percent of the sand moving toward the caves.
</P>
<P>
The final weapon used to curb soil erosion and drifting sand is
silicon emulsion, which is sprayed to fix the sandy surface on the
top of the caves, Wang explained.
</P>
<P>
The conservation work was jointly conducted by specialists from
Wang's institute, the Lanzhou Desert Research Institute under the
Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Getty Conservation Institute
of the United States.

BEIRUT, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Two Israeli warplanes violated
Lebanese skies by flying over Beirut Thursday noon, the first
provocation after the withdrawal of the Israeli occupation forces
from south Lebanon on May 24, local radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Two planes broke the sound barrier over Beirut's downtown,
witnesses were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The jets left white trails in the sky and flew away towards
north, they added.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time of Israeli violation to Lebanese skies
since
Israel promised to respect Lebanese sovereignty and ended the 22-
year occupation of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
There is no comment about the matter from the Lebanese
government so far.
</P>
<P>
Just four days ago, U.N. Security Council accepted the
conclusion
made by Secretary General Kofi Annan that Israel had fully
implemented
concerned U.N. resolutions which call for Israeli pullout from
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Annan has won pledge from Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak to end encroachments on the Lebanese border, local newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
However, Lebanon has been complaining to the U.N. about the
Israel's violations along Lebanese-Israeli border and rejected the
Security Council's verification of Israel's full withdrawal from
Lebanon.

JERUSALEM, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Israel's ultra-Orthodox Shas
party decided on Thursday to remain in the ruling coalition,
shortly
before the deadline of its ministers' resignation to take effect.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced after Shas party leaders met the
party spiritual leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef. Shas leader Eli Yishai
earlier said if his party returns to the government, it will be a
full partner in the coalition.
</P>
<P>
A senior Shas official told Israel Radio that Shas, the
largest ruling partner of the One Israel alliance, achieved its
aims, and will recommend to Ovadia Yosef that Shas not quit the
coalition.
</P>
<P>
Shas ministers tendered letters of resignation to Prime
Minister Ehud Barak on Tuesday, leaving the ruling One Israel only
48 hours to persuade Shas not to bolt the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Three ministers of the left-wing Meretz party, Shas' arch

Three ministers of the left-wing Meretz party, Shas' arch rival
in the ruling coalition, Wednesday night submitted letters of
resignation to the prime minister, a move considered pivotal to
clearing the obstacle for Shas to rescind their resignation
decision. During a meeting with members of his One Israel Party
on Thursday, Barak said the emerging government, with Shas in his
coalition, is the most comfortable for advancing government
policies.
</P>
<P>
Barak said the Meretz faction of the Knesset, even if not a
coalition member, is a natural partner with the government and can
be expected to support the government polices.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said having Shas as a coalition partner and
Meretz's support from the outside represents the best possible deal
for his government.
</P>
<P>
Meretz minsters have pledged their continued support for the
government even though they have left the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Meretz party leader and former education minister Yossi Sarid
Thursday said he had invested too much in efforts to resolve the
coalition crisis and is no longer interested in going from "
surrender to surrender, from blackmail to blackmail."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Tel Aviv, Sarid said now Shas
must act appropriately as a member of the coalition.
</P>
<P>
He also said he expects to see Shas vote next week in favor of
transferring control of the Arab Village of Abu Dis outside
Jerusalem to the Palestinian Authority, and against a bill to
dissolve the Knesset.

<HEADLINE> Manila Eyes to Resume Talks with Abu Sayyaf Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Thursday that its chief negotiator, Secretary Robert Aventajado
expects to meet with the Abu Sayyaf anew in the next few days to
work out the safe release of 21 hostages in Sulu province.
</P>
<P>
According to Press Secretary and Presidential Spokesman Ricardo
Puno, Aventajado relayed this assessment after studying Abu Sayyaf
's demands, including the creation of an Islamic state in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
"He has not given a specific time when it is possible for him to
go there (Sulu) in the very near future. He can safely say in the
next few days he can move there already," Puno told reporters in
the Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
Puno also expressed optimism that humanitarian missions would
be able to deliver food, medicine and other forms of assistance to
the hostages as well in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf, he noted, has shown some "favorable" action to
allow the medical missions to resume.
</P>
<P>
He also said a French psychiatrist will be allowed to accompany
a team in the next medical mission to tend to the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora, for his part, said the
government will convince the Abu Sayyaf to accept a package of
social development initiatives instead of ransom in exchange for
the release of 21 mostly foreign hostages.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said this approach conforms both with the government's
no-ransom policy, and with its commitment to developing Mindanao
into a land of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The 21 hostages, including two Filipinos and nationals from
Malaysia, Finland, South Africa, France, Germany and Lebanon, were
kidnapped from Sipadan Island in Malaysia on April 23 and later
taken to Jolo Island in Sulu province.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that the Abu Sayyaf had reunited their 10
Caucasian and 11 Asian captives, who had earlier been separated
into two groups.
</P>
<P>
Government negotiators led by Aventajado, chairman of the
presidential flagship projects committee, held talks with the Abu
Sayyaf on May 27 but failed to secure the release of the hostages.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea, DPRK to Discuss Reunion of Separated Families </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Red Cross officials from South Korea
and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) will meet in
the DPRK next week to discuss the procedural matters of arranging
reunions of family members separated by the Korean War in the
early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean side has accepted a DPRK proposal to have the
meeting at Kumgangsan (Diamond Mountains) Hotel, about 200
kilometers southeast of Pyongyang, a South Korean Unification
Ministry spokesman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the DPRK Red Cross Society proposed the change of
the meeting venue from the truce village of Panmunjom to
Kumgangsan.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean Red Cross said it suggested opening five
telephone lines to facilitate communications between the hotel and
Seoul and allowing South Korean journalists to cover the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"In order to hold talks efficiently, we believe it appropriate
to set up five South-North hot lines between Seoul and the
Kumgangsan Hotel and to guarantee press coverage," said a
spokesman for the South Korean Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
At the inter-Korean summit held in Pyongyang last week, South
Korean President Kim Dae-jung and DPRK leader Kim Jong Il agreed
to arrange reunions of separated family members on August 15,
timed with the 55th anniversary of the liberation of the Korean
Peninsula from Japanese colonization.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first inter-Korean Red Cross meeting in the DPRK
other than the truce village of Panmunjom.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. House Wednesday emphatically rejected a move to end
U.S. participation in the World Trade Organization (WTO) but sent
a message that improvements are needed in the way the body governs
world trade. In a 363 to 56 vote, lawmakers defeated a motion that
would have withdrawn Congress's approval from the accord
establishing the WTO.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. Senate endorsed an aid package of nearly 1 billion
U.S. dollars Wednesday night to help Colombia equip and train
security forces to combat drug traffickers in a country where the
narcotics trade and guerrilla insurgency support each other.
</P>
<P>
-- President Laurent Kabila of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo said Wednesday that he was shutting down an effort by the
Organization of African Unity to open a political discourse among
warring factions in his country and banning the group's mediator
because he had openly criticized the government.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. conservative House Republicans took a shot at President
Bill Clinton's landmark gun-safety deal with Smith &AMP; Wesson Corp.
and missed, failing to prevent the Federal government from
implementing the pact.
</P>
<P>
-- The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries Wednesday
agreed to raise its output by 708,000 barrels a day, a little more
than expected, but not enough to bring down oil or gasoline prices
by much.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian supreme leader and
Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on
Thursday appointed Mustafa Torabipur as Deputy Commander of the
Army to replace Naser Arasteh.
</P>
<P>
Torabipur, former chief of joint staff of the army, was
appointed on the proposal of the newly-appointed Commander of the
Army Mohammad Salimi, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Khamenei also appointed former Deputy Chief of Staff
of the Army Shahram Rostami to replace Torabipur. However, the
report did not give the reason for the changes in the army.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei on May 21 appointed Brigadier General Mohammad Salimi
as Commander of the Army to replace Ali Shahbazi, who resigned from
the post for unknown reasons.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei made the changes amid ongoing power struggle between
the conservatives, who dominate most of sensitive organs, and the
reformists, who recently took over the parliament from the
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Iran's armed forces under Khamenei's command include three major
parts, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), the Army and
the Security Forces (police).
</P>
<P>
The IRGC and the Army have their separate air, ground and naval
forces.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Asks Annan to Follow up Peace Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
Thursday asked visiting United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan
to continue his efforts to push forward the peace process on all
tracks.
</P>
<P>
The request was made at a joint press conference held after
their meeting in the West Bank city of Ramallah Thursday afternoon,
during which Arafat stressed the importance of enforcing the U.N.
resolutions regarding the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat discussed with Annan, who arrived in Ramallah Thursday
morning from Tel Aviv, the latest developments in the peace process
and means of boosting the process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat thanked Annan for supporting the Palestinian cause and
his efforts to push forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In response to a query as to the possibility of holding a
tripartite Palestine-Israel-United States summit, Arafat said what
is important is not the holding of such summits but the faithful
implementation of all signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Annan pledged to do his best to enforce all the U.
N. resolutions, particularly Resolutions 242 and 338, urging Israel
to pull out of the Arab territories it occupied during the 1967
Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. also seeks to work for progress on all tracks, said
Annan, pointing out that he supports the current U.S. mediation
over the Arab-Israeli conflict and that he makes sustained contacts
with Washington in this respect.
</P>
<P>
Before his stay in Ramallah, Annan had held talks with Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak on the Israeli-Lebanese border dispute.
</P>
<P>
Annan was expected to arrive in Damascus Thursday afternoon to
meet Syrian leaders for consultations over the peace process with
Israel.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani Ex-Premier Faces Treason Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 22 (Xinhua) -- A petition was filed on Thursday
in a court in Pakistan, seeking registration of treason case
against ousted prime minister Nawaz Sharif for "leaking state
secrets" to the public.
</P>
<P>
Arif Noor, a citizen of Lahore, provincial capital of Punjab
where Sharif rose to power, prayed in his petition handed to the
Lahore High Court that a treason case be constituted against the
former prime minister, sources from Lahore told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with legal procedures, Lahore High Court has
issued notice to the Attorney General of Pakistan to appear before
the court on June 30 to explain whether treason charges should be
framed against Sharif, who had already been awarded life
imprisonment in a hijacking case and is being tried in a
corruption case.
</P>
<P>
Sharif, in his June 13 statement, accused the army chief and
the country's military ruler General Pervez Musharraf of
initiating the conflict with India in the Kargil region of Kashmir
last year.
</P>
<P>
India says Pakistan had sent intruders to Kargil while Pakistan
officially denied planing the May-June conflict with India, saying
it extended only diplomatic and political support to the insurgent
Kashmiris.
</P>
<P>
Sharif demanded formation of a high level commission to
investigate the conflict. The then prime minister claimed that he
was kept in dark by the military leadership about the Kargil
operation, saying he has irrefutable evidence to substantiate his
claim.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 Indian and Pakistani troops were killed during
the month-long battle in the Kargil region.
</P>
<P>
General Pervez Musharraf snubbed Sharif by questioning why
Sharif did not form a commission when he was the prime minister to
make the investigation. Musharraf blamed the ousted prime minister
for undermining the army.
</P>
<P>
The Kargil conflict had created differences between Sharif and
the army which many believe contributed to his dismissal in a
bloodless coup in October last year.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt to Install More Computers in School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Thursday that it has earmarked some 600 million pesos (15 million
U.S. dollars) for the installation of some 20,000 desktop
computers in public schools nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Trade Secretary Mar Roxas told a meeting that the amount will
be spent over the next 12 months as the government's counterpart
fund for the donation of brand new and used computers to public
high schools by private corporations.
</P>
<P>
"Nearly 600 million pesos will be dedicated to wiring up a
quarter of our national high schools throughout the country," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The government's initiative on education was parallel to the
private-sector led program "Personal Computers for Public High
Schools."
</P>
<P>
Roxas said President Joseph Estrada formed a task force under
the trade department to coordinate with the private sector in
implementing the program.
</P>
<P>
The task force includes the Department of Education, Culture
and Sports, Department of Science and Technology and the National
Economic and Development Authority.
</P>
<P>
Roxas said under the program, 20 desktop computers for each
laboratory and one laboratory for every national high school will
be installed.
</P>
<P>
"This will immediately cut by a third the shortfall that we
have in terms of penetration and access of our children to
computers," Roxas said.
</P>
<P>
The students themselves will help sustain the program and
install more computers by paying a minimum of 100 pesos (2.5
dollars) each per semester as access fee, said Roxas.

<HEADLINE> Four World Heritage Sites in China Certified by UNESCO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) issued here today
World Heritage Certificates to four Chinese sites.
</P>
<P>
The four sites are Wuyi Mountain in east China's Fujian
Province, Dazu Stone Carvings in Chongqing Municipality in the
southwest, the Summer Palace and the Temple of Heaven in Beijing.
They were listed as world heritage sites by UNESCO in 1998 and
1999.
</P>
<P>
At a certificate issuing ceremony, Wei Yu, director of the
Chinese Committee for UNESCO, said that "it is a historic task for
us to protect world heritage sites."
</P>
<P>
"It is important to well deal with the relationship between
protecting world heritage sites and developing tourism," she added.
</P>
<P>
China has 23 world heritage sites, ranking fourth after Italy,
Spain and France. The world has some 630 world heritage sites in
118 countries.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wenbin, director of the State Administration of Cultural
Heritage (SACH), said that China has made great contributions to
world heritage protection.
</P>
<P>
But he warned local officials not to develop tourism at the
expense of damaging the "integrity and authenticity" of world
heritage sites.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Minister of Construction Zhao Baojiang said that more
places in China are hopeful of being listed as world heritage
sites as the country has a vast territory, a long history and
abundant natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Siqing, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and Noboru
Noguchi, UNESCO Representative to China, attended today's ceremony.

Yet the decreases in consumer prices in April and May were

<HEADLINE> FM Spokesman on Illegal Immigration Case in Dover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua)-- The Chinese government strongly
condemns the illegal immigration activities and calls for
cooperation among the international community to crack down on the
organizers, according to Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu
Bangzao.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remarks here today at the regular press conference
when commenting on the death of 58 illegal immigrants in the
English port of Dover recently.
</P>
<P>
"We were shocked to learn the news. We deeply regret their
death and send our condolences to all the victims' families," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe it is a transnational crime deliberately plotted,
organized and instigated by the 'snake heads' -- human being
traffickers," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
China is opposed to any form of illegal immigration and will
spare no efforts to crack down on such activities, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said clamping down on gangs of international organized crime
is an important and effective means to stop stowaway and illegal
immigration.
</P>
<P>
It should be noted that those criminal gangs, taking advantage
of the flaws in the laws of some countries, very often get
illegal immigrants to apply for political asylum in their target
countries and they often succeed.
</P>
<P>
The tragedy in Dover should help the international community
especially those target countries wake up to the reality to stop
the loopholes, and relevant countries should cooperate to crack
down on inhuman trafficking in human beings, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that relevant Chinese departments, closely following
the results of the investigation, have been keeping close contact
and cooperation with British counterparts and are ready to provide
further assistance on the matter.

BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has offered
12 million yuan (1.4 million U.S. dollars) to reward people who
report to local police or departments concerned the production and
trading of pornographic and pirated goods and other illegal
publications in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Yu Youxian, director of the State Press and Publication

Yu disclosed that a person who helped expose a major case,
involving four production lines, had been rewarded with as much as
1.2 million yuan (140,000 dollars).

<HEADLINE> Moody's Upgrades Thailand's Sovereign Rating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Moody's Investors Service
announced Thursday that it had upgraded Thailand's sovereign
credit rating to investment grade from "junk" status, citing the
country's broad economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
The influential U.S. credit rating agency said in a statement
that it had raised Thailand's country ceiling for foreign-currency
long-term bonds and notes to Baa3, the lowest investment grade,
from Ba1, or junk status, and placed a stable outlook on the new
rating.
</P>
<P>
The agency also raised the long-term debt and deposit ratings
of 12 Thai banks and financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Thai Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda welcomed the
announcement, saying that it would help encourage new investment
and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The action on the banks meant that the agency understood
Thailand's efforts to restructure the economy and banking sector
after the 1997 financial crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
The upgrade comes two-and-a-half years after Moody's cut
Thailand's debt to junk status. The devaluation of the Thai baht
in July 1997 triggered the Asian financial crisis and crippled
Thailand's economy and banking system.
</P>
<P>
In a series of moves in 1997, Moody's slashed Thailand's long-
term debt rating from A2 to Ba1.
</P>
<P>
Now Thailand's rating is the same as Malaysia's and one notch
below South Korea's. While Thailand's rating is still four notches
below its level at the beginning of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Moody's said that its action was prompted by Thailand's
prospects for a balance of payments performance that would support
a substantial improvement in the country's external liquidity
position and reduce vulnerability to external shocks.
</P>
<P>
The country's economy returned to growth last year after
shrinking 10.2 percent in 1998. The latest official forecast said
that the economy is expected to grow 5.5 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the broadening economic recovery and
strengthening of the country's institutions had made the financial
sector more stable. And there was evidence of progress being made
in corporate debt restructuring.
</P>
<P>
However, it said, further legal and institutional reforms were
necessary to help resolve difficulties faced by Thai corporations
and to ensure the financial sector will be able to support a
sustained recovery.
</P>
<P>
Moody's said future ratings would be determined by the
authorities' ability to maintain "prudent and flexible" policies
to prevent a recurrence of the problems that triggered the economy
into crisis in 1997.
</P>
<P>
On the bank upgrades, Moody's said Thailand's financial system
continued to be weak, though all institutions have embarked upon
wide ranging reforms.
</P>
<P>
Despite a sometimes volatile stock market, and fluctuating
investor confidence, it is increasingly likely that the major Thai
banks will be able to restore their capital bases over a
reasonable period, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
Moody's also praised Thai government measures taken since the
crisis, saying that they had restored funding stability.
</P>
<P>
The rating agency raised the bank financial strength ratings of
three major Thai commercial banks, which are Bangkok Bank, Thai
Farmers Bank and Siam Commercial Bank.

<HEADLINE> Portugal Reiterates Political Solution to Angolan Civil War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime
Gama has reiterated the need for a political solution to the
Angolan civil war although the European Union (EU) has expressed
"clearly" its support for the U.N. sanctions against the Angolan
rebels led by Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
Gama made the remarks after receiving an Angolan parliamentary
delegation, said a report by the Portuguese Lusa News Agency
reaching here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Such a solution should be based on the 1991 and 1994 peace
accords signed respectively in Bicesse, Portugal and Lusaka,
Zambia, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said this stance came after the Monday-Tuesday EU summit in
northern Portugal, adding that it is a common position that
enhances as core element for resolution of the Angolan questions.
</P>
<P>
The position is also an appeal to all, whether members of the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola or other
parties, to take a political stance on the path of peace, he said.
</P>
<P>
Angola has suffered over 25 years of civil conflicts since 1975
when the southern African country gained independence from the
Portuguese colonists.
</P>
<P>
Accusing Savimbi of failing to keep his promise during the 1992
general elections and refusing to fulfill the Lusaka Protocol, the
Angolan government has decided not to deal with Savimbi, local
analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Jails 165 Burundian Refugees for Decamping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 22 (Xinhua) -- A Tanzanian court has
sentenced three to six months jail terms to 165 Burundians who
fled the refugee camps in a bid to join the rebels fighting in
Burundi, local newspapers reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The western Kigoma regional court found Wednesday the
Burundians guilty of illegal decamping from three refugee camps in
Kibondo District last month, a senior police officer was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian laws set that all the refugees should be confined to
their camps for fear of disturbing local residents.
</P>
<P>
The Kigoma Regional Police Commander, Assistant Commissioner of
Police Placid Chaka, said that all the 165 Burundian refugees
refused to go back to the refugee camps, but wanted to be
repatriated to their motherland to join a main rebel force, the
National Council for Defense of Democracy- Forces for Defense of
Democracy (CNDD-FDD).
</P>
<P>
Chaka said the Burundian refugees, all of Hutu origin, were
arrested by the police in Kibondo on May 18 when they were
travelling in two vehicles from their camps in Karago, Mtendeli
and Nduta in the Kigoma region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) has reiterated its call on Tanzanian government to allow
refugees living in camps to engage themselves in self-supporting
activities.
</P>
<P>
In her speech to commemorate Africa Refugee Day on Tuesday at
Lukole Refugee Camp in Ngara District, the UNHCR Representative in
Tanzania Marjon Kamara also called on refugees to respect the laws
of Tanzania and abide by the established requirement of refugees
status.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Ministry of Home Affairs said early this week that
the country was hosting more than 800,000 refugees from
neighboring Burundi, Rwanda and the DRC.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique to Set Up Telecenter to Serve Triangular Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique is to set up a
telecenter in the western province of Tete to facilitate
communications between the areas covered by the "Triangular
Development" project between Mozambique, Malawi and Zambia, local
media reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A project mission of business people, including a
representative of the Canadian government, visited Tete recently,
the report said, adding that Canada is among the potential sources
of finance for the project.
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the project aims to promote trade and
investment between the three member countries of the Southern
African Development Community.
</P>
<P>
"The consensus reached by the business mission was that it is
feasible to set up a telecenter in that province, taking into
account that it will be a means to facilitate communication
between business people, students, and farmers," Tete provincial
governor Virgilio Ferrao was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
It could also assist in the implementation of projects,
particularly in the areas of health and education, "which will
mean an advance in all areas of human life for the three countries
involved", he said.
</P>
<P>
Similar telecenters have already been set up elsewhere in
Mozambique, and in some regions of Malawi and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Existing Mozambican telecenters, under a pilot project run by
the computer center of the Eduardo Mondlane University, provide
users with access to e-mail and the Internet.

<P>
LONDON, June 22 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Secretary Geoff
Hoon is scheduled to visit China next week as an official guest of
the Chinese government, the Ministry of Defense said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The defense secretary will arrive in China next Monday, where
he will meet his Chinese counterpart, General Chi Haotian, a
defense ministry spokesman told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Hoon will also deliver a speech to the Chinese National Defense
University on North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in the
21st Century.
</P>
<P>
Together with Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan, Hoon will
open a United Kingdom-China joint peacekeeping seminar in Beijing.
The aim of this seminar is to enhance Sino-UK liaison and
cooperation, and to exchange views on the challenges involved in
peacekeeping in the 21st Century.
</P>
<P>
Defense cooperation with China forms an important part of
Britain's overall policy of engagement with the Chinese on a wide
range of issues, a statement issued by the defense ministry said.
</P>
<P>
As a fellow permanent member of the Security Council, Britain
want to work with China in promoting international and regional
security issues, it said.
</P>
<P>
Since the Prime Minister Tony Blair's visit to China in October
1998, Britain and China have committed themselves to strengthening
and expanding their political-military dialogue, and to a program
of senior military visits and ministerial exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Hoon will leave China on June 29, according to the program.
Hoon is scheduled to visit South Korea prior to his visit to China.

<HEADLINE> China Offers Proposals for Restarting Work in Disarmament Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese delegation has put
forward proposals to restart substantive work in the Conference on
Disarmament (CD).
</P>
<P>
"So far, the CD has failed to conduct substantive work for more
than three years. The direct reason for the stalemate is the
failure to formulate a program of work. The Chinese delegation is
deeply concerned with this situation," China's Ambassador for
Disarmament Affairs Hu Xiaodi said here Thursday at the CD plenary
session.
</P>
<P>
According to the CD's rules of procedure, the program of work
is the prerequisite and basis for the CD to conduct substantive
work, Hu said. Therefore, at the present stage, the CD should
first and foremost make every effort to work out a program of work
acceptable to all its members.
</P>
<P>
The proposals of the Chinese delegation include the following:
</P>
<P>
First, the CD's program of work should be considered as a whole
and every item on its agenda should be treated in a comprehensive
and balanced way.
</P>
<P>
In view of the fact that different sides and parties insist on
different priority items, comprehensiveness and balance are the
only guarantee for fair play, ensuring that the interests and
concerns of all states are appropriately taken care of.
</P>
<P>
Second, the CD's work is not conducted in a vacuum and the
current international reality should not be ignored. Therefore,
the CD's program of work must address, rather than evade, the real
problems in the international security, particularly those
developments which have major negative impacts on international
peace and on arms control and disarmament.
</P>
<P>
"Proceeding from these considerations, the Chinese delegation
is prepared to seriously study and actively support all proposals
that meet the above-mentioned requirements, including the
establishment of negotiating mechanisms for the three agenda items,
namely the prevention of an arms race in outer space, nuclear
disarmament, and the fissile material cut-off treaty," Hu said.
</P>
<P>
To enable the CD to start its substantive work as early as
possible, the Chinese ambassador said that his delegation,
together with all other delegations, is ready to work out a truly
comprehensive and balanced program of work.
</P>
<P>
He also called on all the other delegations to make the same
efforts so that the CD could work out of the stalemate at an early
date and create new splendor.

<HEADLINE> Grassroots Courts in China Urged to Ensure Justice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Lu Gan, a senior Party official
in charge of legal construction in China, said here today that
grassroots courts must ensure that justice prevails.
</P>
<P>
"The people's courts at various levels should put justice above
everything else," said Luo, secretary of the Committee of
Political Science and Law Under the Chinese Communist Party (CPC)
Central Committee, at a national conference on court work.
</P>
<P>
Luo is also a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central
Committee.
</P>
<P>
He said that courts should provide judicial guarantees and
legal services for the development of China's social productive
forces, and for the fundamental interests of the overwhelming
majority of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee, courts
across the country have made steady progress in enhancing
professional quality over the years, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, corruptive practices exist among some court employees,
and violations against the law take place from time to time,
undermining the reputation of courts and judges and tarnishing the
image of the Party and government, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Party should strengthen its leadership role over court
work, and support the independent judicial power of courts and
judging panels," he said.

<HEADLINE> Manila Offers Development Package for Hostages' Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Thursday that it will convince the extremist Abu Sayyaf to accept
a package of social development initiatives instead of ransom in
exchange for the release of 21 mostly foreign hostages.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said this approach conforms
both with the government's no-ransom policy, and with its
commitment to develop Mindanao into a land of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
"We expect them to demand ransom in the end. But we will try to
convince them to accept social development projects instead of
ransom.We have said this long ago," Zamora said in a radio
interview.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated the government's stand that any parallel
negotiation by foreign governments with the Abu Sayyaf must be
limited to humanitarian concerns, such as medical aid and food
supplies for the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said the government recognizes the concern of foreign
governments to make sure that their hostaged nationals get food,
medicine and other supplies while in captivity.
</P>
<P>
The hostages include two Filipinos and nationals from Malaysia,
Finland, South Africa, France, Germany and Lebanon. They were
kidnapped from Sipadan Island in Malaysia on April 23 and later
taken to Jolo Island in Sulu province.
</P>
<P>

The pegging of the ringgit at 3.80 to the US dollar and the
imposition of selective exchange controls on September 2, 1998, "
would stay as long as the international financial architecture is
not reformed," he told a conference here organized by the
Malaysian-Australian Business Council.
</P>
<P>
The adviser said that despite some estimates that the ringgit
was undervalued by 15 to 20 percent, the government felt that the
undervaluation was only between 6 and 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government would be concerned about undervaluation only if
there was a wide distortion of 40 to 50 percent over a long period
of time, he said.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the recent regional financial crisis to the
manipulative trading of hedge funds, saying their attacks on
regional currencies had caused loss of confidence.
</P>
<P>
He said the Malaysian economy would not have contracted by as
much as 7.5 percent in 1998 if not for the unscrupulous actvities
of the hedge funds.

<HEADLINE> Disarmament Conference Should Discuss Prevention of Arms Race in Outer Space: Chinese Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Conference on Disarmament (CD)
should focus its work on the most pressing, outstanding and
influential issues on international peace and security such as the
prevention of an arms race in outer space (PAROS), a Chinese
diplomat said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"PAROS has every reason to be one of the highest priorities on
the agenda of the CD, the sole multilateral disarmament
negotiating body," China's Ambassador for Disarmament Affairs Hu
Xiaodi told the CD plenary session.
</P>
<P>
Since PAROS was listed on its agenda in 1982, Hu recalled, the
CD established Ad Hoc Committees on PAROS for 10 consecutive years
from 1985 to 1994 and much useful work had been done during that
period.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the United Nations General Assembly once again
adopted at its 54th session by an overwhelming majority the
resolution on the prevention of an arms race in outer space. No
country voted against this resolution.
</P>
<P>
The resolution invites the CD to establish an ad hoc committee
on PAROS as early as possible during its 2000 session and
reiterates that the CD has the primary role in the negotiation of
a multilateral agreement or agreements on the prevention of an
arms race in outer space.
</P>
<P>
"In view of the above, the Chinese delegation maintains that
the CD should reestablish, in line with the wording of the
proposal contained in the CD document about PAROS, to negotiate
and conclude an international legal instrument banning the test,
deployment and use of any weapons, weapons systems and their
components in outer space," Hu said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that it is essential to prevent an arms race in
outer space at a time when a program aimed at the domination of
outer space has been put forward and under implementation, with a
view to seeking unilateral military and strategic superiority.
</P>
<P>
"The most outstanding examples in this regard over the past two
years are the development and planned deployment of the so-called
National and Theater Missile Defense systems," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the relevant program, some advanced weapon systems
will be deployed in outer space or will target objects in outer
space. Some others, by using outer space as a platform, will
provide targeting information and guidance for ground-based weapon
systems.
</P>
<P>
He said that the program "runs counter to the sincere
aspirations of the international community to use outer space for
peaceful purposes."
</P>
<P>
In his statement, the Chinese ambassador also told the session
that the CD will not be directed only against the NMD program when
it conducts substantive work on PAROS.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese delegation believes that under the agenda item of
PAROS, the CD should not confine itself to the above mentioned
issues," he said. "On the contrary, it should cover more extensive
areas, involving not only strategic balance and military and
security situation on the ground, but also the common heritage of
the mankind, the peace and tranquillity in outer space."

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Citizens Save More Foreign Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Foreign currency savings deposits
of Shanghai citizens are increasing rapidly, becoming a major
source of foreign money for Chinese financial institutions,
banking officials said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of May, Shanghai citizens' outstanding amount of
deposits in foreign currencies at Chinese banks stood at 9.17
billion U.S. dollars, accounting for 64 percent of the banks'
foreign currency deposits.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank of China
said that this year residents in the city have been steadily
increasing their deposits, most of which are in fixed terms.
</P>
<P>
Statistics suggest that citizens' foreign currency deposits
markedly increase after interest rates of major foreign currencies
are adjusted higher.
</P>
<P>
Financial analysts forecast that the foreign currency deposits
in Shanghai will continue to rise in the near future.

<HEADLINE> Over Hundred Japanese Explosives Dug out in NE China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 22 (Xinhua) -- More than one hundred explosives
believed to be left over by Japanese aggressor troops were
unearthed in Benxi, Liaoning Province in northeast China early
this month.
</P>
<P>
Local archives show that during the war of resistance against
Japanese Aggression (1937-1945), Japanese troops used to have
their barracks and magazine on the site.
</P>
<P>
Over two days, seven bombs, 56 cannonballs, and about 50 land
mines and grenades were found. They were identified to be made in
Japan in 1938. The explosive capacity was equal to 2,000 kg of TNT,
said local police.
</P>
<P>
Since 1980, at least five local residents have been wounded by
buried explosives while ploughing.
</P>
<P>
Police have closed the surrounding area in case other possible
explosives may still be buried underground.

BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing, the largest city in
China's southwest, is expected to have more consulates from
developed countries, reported today's overseas edition of the "
People's Daily".

The newspaper said that as more multinational companies eye
China's western regions as a potential market, their governments
plan to establish consulates there.
</P>
<P>
Among big cities in the west, Chongqing Municipality is the
most favored choice. Japan and Canada already have consulates in
the city and Britain set up the consulate earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Germany and Australia and other countries have shown interest
in opening their diplomatic offices in China's western regions,
said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Chen Xiao, director with the Chongqing's Foreign Affairs Office,
said that the city, located between affluent east China and
resource-rich west China, will help foreign missions serve to

<P>
KAMPALA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan parliament has passed a
resolution urging the government to withdraw the Uganda People's
Defense Forces (UPDF) from the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC), the New Vision daily reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Parliament urges the government to organize withdrawal of UPDF
troops from Congo in accordance with the Lusaka ceasefire
agreement," the resolution reads.
</P>
<P>
The House, presided over by Speaker Francis Ayume, also passed
a resolution requiring the government to brief it monthly about
the implementation of the Lusaka peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The resolutions were passed during a stormy session that marked
the end of debate on the petition of Parliament Member Winnie
Byanyima on recent clashes between Ugandan and Rwandan troops in
the northeast DRC city of Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
The House, however, rejected a draft resolution urging the
government to utilize all established official channels including
parliament to promote a peaceful relationship with Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan and Rwandan troops, based in Kisangani where they back
rival rebel factions fighting to topple DRC President Laurent
Kabila, clashed two weeks ago, leaving more than 200 civilians

<P>
NAIROBI, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The water shortage is expected to
worsen in the Kenyan capital Nairobi as water levels at the dams
continue to drop due to poor rainfall.
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard newspaper Thursday quoted acting Town
Clerk Godfrey Mate as saying that water rationing, which has been
imposed in the higher districts of the city, will now be extended
to the lower districts including the city center.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Lambastes Private Oil Firms for Creating Fuel Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has lambasted private oil
marketing companies for creating an artificial fuel shortage in
the country, Zambia Daily Mail newspaper reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Energy and Water Development Deputy Minister Celestino Chibamba
was quoted by the newspaper as saying in an interview in Lusaka on
Wednesday that what appeared to be a fuel shortage in the country
had been caused by private oil marketing companies that did not
want to pay the Zambia National Oil Company (ZNOC) in advance for
the commodity.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister said these oil companies who are refusing
to pay in advance were responsible for supplying fuel to service
stations.
</P>
<P>
Chibamba said ZNOC has been unable to get the commodity from the
 warehouse due to non-payment by private oil companies.
</P>
<P>
Zambia had enough stocks of fuel to last a considerably longer
period, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government would not allow a situation where dealers take
measures that adversely affected the country and the people, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Chibamba said there should be no excuse or fuel shortage as all
private companies were given permits to import their own petroleum
products.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, prices of petroleum products went up
by 33 percent three weeks ago. Sweet light crude oil had gone up
to 33 U.S. dollars per barrel form 24 dollars while petrol was now
pegged at 390 per ton from 280 dollars. Gas oil was increased to
230 dollars per ton from 200 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Some filling stations in Lusaka have had no fuel for almost a
week now.

<HEADLINE> HIV/AIDS Reduces Life Expectancy to 34 Years in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- HIV/AIDS has taken off no less than
15 years from the healthy life expectancy of the most affected
countries with Zambia' s life expectancy falling to less than 34
years, Zambian newspaper, The Post, reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Launching the World Health Report 2000 in Lusaka on Wednesday,
World Health Organization (WHO) representative Edward Maganu said
HIV/AIDS was a major contributor to the disability adjusted life
expectancy at birth of between 25.9 and 34.9 years in most African
countries, particularly in sub- Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
Maganu said according to WHO assessment, it did not follow that
the more a government spends on health systems, the higher its
performance.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Zambia has been ranked 182 with a
total health expenditure as a share of its Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) of between 5.3 and 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The highest spender on health according to the report was the
United States with a GDP portion of 10.5-13.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Police Step up Efforts to Ensure Peaceful Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Zimbabwean policemen
have been deployed throughout the country to ensure a peaceful
parliamentary election at the weekend, with patrols increased in
areas where political violence has been rife.
</P>
<P>
A significant number of policemen would be guarding polling
stations on a 24-hour basis starting from Wednesday night until
the last ballot box is delivered to the counting station, said
police spokesman Chief Superintendent Wayne Bvudzijena on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said apart from the deployment of officers, the police have
also put in place other measures which include the revoking of
leave days and maintaining the Law and Order (Maintenance) Act
which was invoked in April following the eruption of countrywide
political violence, local media reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Several special reaction units have also been deployed on
standby as back-up to the officers, he said, adding that the
police have recalled the " Crocodile" armored vehicles and bought
state-of-the-art telecommunication equipment to ensure that they
swiftly enter trouble spots, should any violence occur.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that the elections will run smoothly because
we have put in place special measures which revolve around
Wednesday's massive deployment of officers to the provinces," he
said.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman called on people to enjoy their weekend
as usual, saying that the only thing they need to remember is to
behave well and not to flout any electoral laws.
</P>
<P>
At the weekend, no gathering of more than 12 people is allowed
within 100 meters of a polling station, he said, stressing that
people should avoid sloganeering or canvassing for votes within
that distance.
</P>
<P>
Members of the public should secure their houses when going to
vote since some criminal elements are likely to take advantage of
the situation to break into homes, he said.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-six people have died, 185 others injured and property
worth millions of U.S. dollars destroyed in over 300
politically-motivated clashes that have occurred since February
this year.

<HEADLINE> Facilitator Office for Congo Issue Closed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The office of Ketumile Masire,
facilitator in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) peace
mission, has been closed, said Zambia President Frederick Chiluba
here on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's Times of Zambia newspaper quoted the president as
saying in an interview at the State House that he had received
disturbing news that DRC President Laurent Kabila had shut the
office in Kinshasa over some disagreement.
</P>
<P>
He described the action as ill-timed because tremendous
progress has been made toward restoring peace in the trouble-torn
country.
</P>
<P>
"This is coming at a time when fighting in Kisangani between
Uganda and Rwanda has been brought to an end and the two parties
are ready to leave control of Kisangani for the United Nations
forces," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Masire's role is to facilitate dialogue, I only hope internal
dialogue can take place especially so that terms of the Lusaka
agreement can be complied with," Chiluba said. Masire is former
president of Botswana.
</P>
<P>
According to Chiluba, he would contact U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan and Kabila to try and resolve the issue.
</P>
<P>
This is not the sort of setback that should prevent the
implementation of the peace process, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that both the Joint Military Council and the U.N.
forces have made tremendous progress to pave way for the arrival
of the nearly 5,000 peacekeeping troops.
</P>
<P>
Peace is vital to the DRC as the overall investment prospects
depended on political stability in the whole region, he said.

<HEADLINE> Bird Island to Be Recovered From Farmland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Islamic International Trust
and Investment Company in northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous
Region plans to invest 100 million yuan (about 12.04 million U.S.
dollars) to rebuild an island habitat for birds on the upper
reaches of the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
The three-year project will be carried out by turning farmland
into forests, grassland, and water areas.
</P>
<P>
The bird island, located at the Qingtong Gorge Reservoir on the
upper reaches of the Yellow River, was formed in the 1960s by sand
which had washed into the reservoir.
</P>
<P>
Every year, the 3,133.3-hectare island attracted more than 300,
000 birds in 170 varieties.
</P>
<P>
But in later years, birds were rarely seen on the island, where
large areas of forest had been cut for timber and other land had
been sewn with crops.
</P>
<P>
This year, the investment company wants to turn 1.333 hectares
of farmland into water areas, 800 hectares of farmland into
grassland, and build 40 kilometers of roads.

TAIYUAN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- A white marble outer casket dating
back some 1,400 years is considered to belong to ancient Central
Asian cultures.
</P>
<P>
The outer casket dates back to the Sui Dynasty (581-618) and is
the first of its kind ever discovered in China. Chinese
archaeologists unearthed the two-meter-high and 2.96-meter-long
white marble outer casket when excavating a tomb in Wangguocun
Village, Jinyuan District in Taiyuan, capital city of north China'
s Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
There are over 50 pieces of relief sculpture on the casket
depicting humans and gods attending a banquet, watching dances and
fights between men and lions.
</P>
<P>
The white marble outer casket is highly significant since stone
reliefs depicting ancient Central Asian culture have rarely been
found in China before.
</P>
<P>
Scholars from Zhongshan University said the casket will be
invaluable for studying ancient Central Asian culture, the Silk
Road (Central Asia section) and cultural exchanges between ancient
China and the Central Asia.

<HEADLINE> China to Resettle Police-rescued Abducted Women and Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Police units across China will
help resettle women and children they have rescued, a notice
issued by the Ministry of Public Security says.
</P>
<P>
"The work of resettlement can cap the achievement of the
nationwide crackdown on traffickers of women and children, which
kicked off on April 1st," the notice reads.
</P>
<P>
China began its current "hukou" system, or the permanent
residence registration system, in the late 1950s, as a way to
ensure the accurate and timely control of the country's population
information.
</P>
<P>
According to the notice, police departments will help regain
the residence rights of those rescued women and children whose
registration certificates had been revoked after their
disappearance.
</P>
<P>
The notice stipulates that police should also respect the
wishes of the newly-freed abducted women if they choose to marry
in accordance with Chinese law with their "husbands" who had
previously bought their wives illicitly, and help those women to
find new homes.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Hezbullah, or Party of God, is a full-pledged regional
player, and should not be ignored in any peace settlement, visiting
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan indicated on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Annan also said that Hezbullah Secretary General Sheikh Hassan
Nasrallah had told him the organization intends no further military
action, but instead looks to establish its political structure in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint conference with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak, Annan brushed off criticism that in meeting with Nasrallah
earlier this week, he had given the organization unwarranted
legitimacy, saying it is his duty to work with all involved
parties.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Barak on Wednesday accepted the resignation of three cabinet
ministers from the left-wing Meretz party, which has been long in
dispute with the ultra-Orthodox Shas party over funding for the
latter's school system.
</P>
<P>
Barak told the Meretz ministers that he regretted their decision
and appreciated the concession they had made in order to enable the
peace process to continue.
</P>
<P>
Barak did not try to persuade the Meretz ministers to reconsider
their decision. Meretz has pledged to support the government as if
it were still part of the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv
</P>
<P>
-- A 41-year-old man, Reuven Sheinfeld, Wednesday shot dead his
wife, 40, and then committed suicide in their home in Haifa, a
northern coastal city of Israel.
</P>
<P>
It was the latest in a growing wave of violence rocking the
country.
</P>
<P>
The bodies of the couple were found by their 16-year-old
daughter when she returned home. Police said it appeared that the
couple were in the process of getting divorced.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Barak has decided to intensify his government's dialogue with
the Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Barak spoke of
the need for an "ongoing and thorough dialogue" between the sides,
following his meetings with the settler leaders during the last
year.
</P>
<P>
He instructed his ministers to travel to settlements with senior
government officials and meet with the residents there, who have
been fighting against further land transfer to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
At the security cabinet meeting on Wednesday, the ministers
called for more concessions toward the Palestinians, in an attempt
to forge an agreement.

<HEADLINE> Manila Vows to Improve Health Services for Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Health authorities of the
Philippines assured the public Thursday that the government
continues to strive to improve health services for Filipinos,
especially the poor.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Alberto Romualdez of the Department of Health (DOH)
said the government has sought the assistance of the World Health
Organization (WHO) in reforming areas of Philippine health care
that need improvement.
</P>
<P>
"We will look at our citizens' health status. Then we'll see
what needs to be done with the system to address problems in
health care,"Romualdez said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
Romualdez issued the statement in reaction to reports that the
Philippines ranked 60th in terms of health care among 191
countries surveyed by the WHO.
</P>
<P>
"We will study the factors that figured in our ranking so that
we can solve problems in areas that the WHO thinks still need
improvement," he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the DOH is to launch a health sector reform
agenda Friday, in time for its 102nd anniversary. The program aims
to introduce improvements to the health care program.
</P>
<P>
Romualdez said the agenda aims to make sure poor and unemployed
Filipinos are able to avail themselves of health care service.
</P>
<P>
According to Romualdez, this includes "health passport" that
allows the bearers access to medical care from government and the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
He said the DOH has started implementing the program by giving
health insurance to its own employees, and to indigent Filipinos.
The next target of the health insurance program are self-employed
Filipinos, said Romualdez.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Speaker Regrets Over Bank Governor Detention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the Indonesia's House
of Representatives (DPR) Akbar Tandjung said here Thursday that
his side regretted over the detention of the country's Central
Bank Governor Syahril Sabirin and hoped there will be a fair trial
against him.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the press conference here after presiding over a
special meeting with members of Board of Director of Bank
Indonesia,Tandjung said, "After studying reasons of the detention
of Bank Indonesia's governor, I think that such reasons are not
reasonable."
</P>
<P>
The Attorney General's Office spokesman Yushar Yahya announced
a 20-day detention of Sabirin Wednesday, saying it was to
facilitate the investigation into him on the charges of the Bali
Bank scandal.
</P>
<P>
The scandal revolves around Bank Indonesia's (the central bank)
reimbursement of 904 billion rupiah (129 million U.S. dollars) in
defaulted loans to other banks. Some 546 billion rupiah (78
million U.S. dollars) of the money was then paid to PT Era Giat
Prima for helping Bali Bank recoup the money. There is suspicion
that a large portion of the money went to help the then ruling
party of Golkar to run for its presidential renomination of BJ.
Habibie.
</P>
<P>
Tanjung, who is also Golkar party's general chairman, said, "I
know him (Syahril Sabirin). He is very cooperative with
prosecutors and it is impossible for him to make evidences
disappear or running away," he said, adding that he will soon ask
President Abdurrahman Wahid and Attorney General Marzuki Darusman
about the detention of Sabirin.
</P>
<P>
Sabirin, one of several former ministers who have been
allegedly involved in the Bank Bali scandal, was named as suspect
early this month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Senior Deputy of Bank Indonesia's Governor, Anwar
Nasution said that he has taken over tasks of Sabirin as the
central bank governor.

<HEADLINE> Nokia Starts New Plant in Guangdong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 22 (Xinhua) -- World-leading mobile phone maker
Nokia has begun production at its new 20-million-U.S.-dollar plant
in Dongguan of south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The new factory, with a floor space of 100,000 square meters,
is equipped with the world's most advanced mobile phone
manufacturing technology.
</P>
<P>
Nokia expects the facility to help increase the exports of its
products. Nokia hopes that this year's exports will make up 50
percent of its total production output, and its local purchases
will also account for half the total.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 Nokia started up its first mobile phone company in
Dongguan in cooperation with a local telecommunications
development firm. The joint venture, which mainly produces digital
mobile phones, turned out the world's first WAP (wireless
application protocol) mobile phone in May 1999. Last year, Nokia
exported 38 percent of its output in Dongguan, with the value of
the exports surpassing one billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The company has so far invested more than one billion U.S.
dollars in China, which is the giant mobile phone maker's second
largest market worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Ecological Deterioration Curbed on Upper Reaches of Yangtze River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- China's efforts to curb the
deteriorating natural environment on the upper reaches of the
Yangtze River, the world third largest, have paid off, satellite
remote sensing studies show.
</P>
<P>
A satellite investigation of the area shows that the soil
erosion in provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan, and Chongqing
Municipality has markedly eased.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan, Sichuan and Chongqing, which are located in the valleys
of the Jinsha River and Jialing River, and the Three Gorges
Reservoir area respectively suffer the most serious soil erosion,
or 90 percent of the total on the upper reaches of the Yangtze
River.
</P>
<P>
The study reveals that compared with 1987, the annual amount of
eroded soil dropped by 11 percent, from the former 1.5 billion
tons to the current 1.339 billion tons. The amount of eroded soil
per square kilometer went down from 5,118.7 tons to 4,216.8 tons.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River valley accounts for one-fifth of the country'
s total land area, one-fourth of the total arable land, one-third
of the total population and two-fifths of the total industrial and
agricultural output value.
</P>
<P>
China launched a water and soil conservation project on the
lower reaches of the Jinsha River, the middle and lower reaches of
the Jialing River and the Three Gorges Reservoir area in 1989.
Later, a project for building shelter forests also started along
the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
The country has so far spent 1.2 billion yuan (about 144
million U.S. dollars) on the water and soil conservation project
and harnessed some 60,000 square kilometers of eroded areas. The
vegetation coverage rate in the project zone has increased from 22
percent to 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the project zones combined, the eroded area has dropped from
65 percent to 36 percent. The total grain output has risen by more
than 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the shelter forest project has helped improve
the vegetation coverage rate from 20 percent to 25 percent in the
project areas. The soil erosion in over 100 counties basically has
been controlled.
</P>
<P>
An expert from the Ministry of Water Resources warned that they
still have a long way to go to restore the environment in the area.

Yunnan golden monkey population has increased rapidly in recent
years because more nature reserves have been built to protect them.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said that over 500 golden monkeys were recently found in
the forests in Tacheng Township, south of Baima Snow Mountain,
where most of the creatures live.
</P>
<P>
"It is still not clear where these monkeys have come from,"
Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
Scientists confirmed that there were only 600 golden monkeys in
the Baima Snow Mountain area in the 1980s; by the early 1990s, the
figure had risen to 1,500.
</P>
<P>
The Yunnan golden monkey is called a state treasure, just like
the giant panda.
</P>
<P>
The state invests one million yuan (120,000 U.S. dollars)
annually to protect the rare species.

<P>
SHENYANG, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Officials with the provincial
government of Liaoning in northeast China said that further
efforts are needed to attract more overseas investment for the old
industrial base of the country.
</P>
<P>
Chen Zhenggao, deputy governor of Liaoning, said recently that
the province plans to get total overseas investment of 2.8 billion
US dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
The province has already got about 700 million US dollars in
contractual overseas investment in the first quater of this year,
up 29.6 percent over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that State-owned enterprises, mainstream of the heavy
industry-oriented province, are expected to get more foreign funds
with help of the government.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the provincial government has chosen about
108 key projects for overseas investors, which will enjoy some
preferential policies. Along with these measures, the government
will especially encourage local enterprises to open branches or

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang to Use More Natural Gas-Fueled Motor Vehicles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region in northwest China plans to raise the number of natural gas-
fueled motor vehicles to 8,000 in the next five years, hoping to
prevent further deterioration of its worsening atmospheric
pollution.
</P>
<P>
The regional capital of Urumqi is one of the most heavily
polluted cities in the world. Exhaust fumes are blamed as the
major source of the problem.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the regional government began to promote the use of
natural gas as fuel for motor vehicles instead of gasoline and
diesel oil. By last year, over 1,000 natural gas-fueled motor
vehicles were in use in Urumqi, and another 200 in cities
elsewhere in Xinjiang, sources said.
</P>
<P>
As a clean energy, natural gas can help control the worsening
air pollution in urban areas of the region and has been widely
used.
</P>
<P>
"Conversion of automobile fuel systems to accommodate natural
gas isn't difficult and costs only about 5,000 to 8,000 yuan,"
said Fang Jianye, a garage owner who does such work, adding that
one year of operation of the environment-friendly vehicles will
cover the cost.
</P>
<P>
The regional government will build more natural gas stations
and also offer low-interest loans for gas-driven vehicle buyers.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang is rich in natural gas and has verified 817.7 billion
cubic meters of natural gas reserves. The increased use of natural
gas motor vehicles will help boost the natural gas market.

BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- China has mastered key technology
for connecting the Internet with mobile phones -- the WAP (
wireless application protocol) network.
</P>
<P>
The technology was developed by the Beijing Guoyan Telecom
Technology Company Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The company put on show a series of services by the WAP network,

</P>
<P>
WAP technology was known by only a few leading mobile phone
manufacturers including Ericsson, Nokia and Motorola. The foreign
companies, however, face big challenges in entering the Chinese
market in terms of localization, habits of Chinese users and
government policies.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Guoyan Company, cooperating with Beijing Posts and
Telecom University, has become the first Chinese telecom
enterprise that has the intellectual rights of the WAP network,
following nearly ten months of research.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, June 22 (Xinhua) -- To build a park was only a
dream for farmers in Zhuanlu village, Dingzhou city of Hebei
province. But now the dream has become a reality as the villagers
have started the construction of a self-funded farmers park.
</P>
<P>
The village is famous for its economic prosperity. It has 14
enterprises, the largest three of which report more than 100
million yuan in output value annually.
</P>
<P>
"Since we are no longer worried about food and clothing, we'd
like to take a walk in parks like other urban counterparts" said
Gao Xishan, an elderly villager.
</P>
<P>
The traditional living style of Chinese farmers has changed.
Traveling across the country by plane or train has become common
practice among better-off farmers.
</P>
<P>
Some farmers have set up libraries and begun to surf the
Internet. Farmer Lou Caigen in east China's Zhejiang province has
opened a website.
</P>
<P>
While farmer's living standards improve, statistics showed that
the expenses farmers in Anhui Province spend on food, clothing and
daily necessities has dropped from 72 percent of their total
incomes in 1990 to 67 percent. In some other places the percentage
is even lower.

<HEADLINE> China's East and West to Reduce Economic Gap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The gap in economic development
between China's eastern and western regions will be sharply
reduced within 30 years, a report released today by the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) predicted.
</P>
<P>
The per-capita GDP of the western areas will reach 3,000-5,000
U.S. dollars according to current value of money in 2030, said the
report conducted by the CASS's Institute of Econometrics and
Techno-Economics.
</P>
<P>
"People will lead a comparatively well-off life," after the
western development plan has been underway for a few decades, the
report claimed.
</P>
<P>
In the next 30 years, western China is scheduled to build a
complete infrastructure network in industry, education and
information as well as a convenient communication network between
cities, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing industry will rely on knowledge and
technology rather than on resources. Agriculture and forestry will
become more eco-friendly, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In the first phase, from 2000 to 2010, China will focus on
creating a favorable environment for investment and try to narrow
the income gap between east and west.
</P>
<P>
The report predicted that the underdeveloped western areas will
wipe out poverty in the 2006-2010 period and secure the money
needed for further development.

<P>
CANBERRA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Prospects for an immediate end to
Fiji's hostage crisis have again been delayed and the 31 captives
are not expected to be released until at least Friday, the
Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Fiji's military commander Frank Bainimarama and Speight were
scheduled to sign an accord to establish an interim government
Thursday, thereby allowing the hostages to go free.
</P>
<P>
But Speight's group claimed the military had redrafted
provisions in the agreement since it was reached on Wednesday
night, the ABC said.
</P>
<P>
Speight's group said the accord is now likely to be signed on
Friday, the ABC said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement would end the five-week-old political crisis
during which the hostages have been held inside parliament.
</P>
<P>
It sets a timetable for the installation of a new government
and outlines the role of the military.
</P>
<P>
The ABC quoted military spokesman Filipo Tarakinikini as saying
both sides are now looking to see the 31 hostages freed by the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
"There's optimism not only to this crisis but also to a country
as whole that we are coming to a close here and I think we should
capture the moment," he said.

<P>
Secretary Jose Pardo of the Department of Finance said the
government is eyeing access to funds from the United Nations (UN)
if it can draw up an acceptable proposal for the plan.
</P>
<P>
"I think we would have access to funds from the UN because they
do have special funds for displaced groups. Therefore (we think)
in 60 days we'll have a proposal in place," Pardo said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Donor countries and institutions had earlier committed new
pledges amounting to 2.6 billion U.S. dollars for the Philippines
in a recent Consultative Group Meeting in Tagaytay city, of which
over 360 million dollars will go to Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Pardo said that the proposed funding from the UN for the
Mindanao rehabilitation plan is separate from the pledges gained
by the Philippines during the Consultative Group Meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said the foreign aid would supplement the regular relief
funds earmarked by government agencies such as the Departments of
National Defense and Social Welfare and Development for Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The National Economic and Development Authority, Pardo noted,
will call meetings within the next few weeks to put together the
proposed Mindanao rehabilitation plan.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government is trying to turn Mindanao into the
country's another food basket, which was hindered by the continued
conflict in that region.

<P>
SAO PAULO, June 21 (Xinhua) -- After a scoreless 90-minute
regular play, Boca Juniors of Argentina beat Palmeiras 4-2 in a
penalty session to clinch the Copa Libertadores Tournament here
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Boca Juniors goalkeeper Cordoba successfully blocked two
powerful shots by Asprilla and Roque Junior to guarantee the
victory for his team, which didn't miss any of its first four
shots.
</P>
<P>
Before the game, Palmeiras coach Luiz Felipe Scolari had
predicted that the Argentine team would play a predominantly
defensive game, and that his team would go on the offensive.
</P>
<P>
But the games was played in an entirely different way. From
the beginning, Boca Juniors went on the attack, catching the
Palmeiras players by surprise and forcing them to go on the
defensive.
</P>
<P>
The Boca Juniors' offensive game almost bore fruit in the
fourth minute, when defender Arrubarrena fired the ball into the
net. But referee Epifanio Gonzalez of Paraguay ruled the goal
unvalid as the player was offsides.
</P>
<P>
Palmeiras was about to turn things around when it switched from
defensive to offensive mode right after the start of the second
half.
</P>
<P>
For some 25 minutes, the Brazilians launched one attack after
another on the Argentine defense.
</P>
<P>
In the 48th minute striker Asprilla was knocked down in front
of the goal when he was to score. But it was not ruled a penalty.
</P>
<P>
Boca nearly scored on several hard-found occasions in the half,
but the ball would either go wild or was blocked by Palmeiras
defense.

<HEADLINE> Crisis in Bangladeshi Export Processing Zone Deepens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The crisis in the towel producing
industries located in the Chittagong Export Processing Zone (CEPZ)
further deepened on Wednesday as 12,000 workers of seven units
abstained from their duties to support the recent move by their
fellows in the towel industries.
</P>
<P>
The agitating workers of the 7 towel factories locked the doors
of those industries Wednesday and staged a sit-in demonstration in
front of their respective unit and the CEPZ office simultaneously,
the Independent reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Besides, over 5000 workers have already started hunger strike
unto death in front of their respective office, CEPZ office and
the Chittagong Press Club simultaneously since Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier the management of the towel producing industries group
had notified over 4000 workers of its three units in the CEPZ to
resume their duties by Wednesday, otherwise, the absentee workers
would be terminated from June 21.
</P>
<P>
The workers of the towel industries in the CEPZ areas are
demanding for getting a raise in pay, as well as trade union
rights now banned in the zone.
</P>
<P>
Due to the actions taken by the striking workers, the mills
have suffered huge losses.
</P>
<P>
Of the total number of 11 towel industries in the CEPZ, one is
Bangladeshi, one Korean while the remaining 9 are Pakistani.

<HEADLINE> Former USOC Drug Chief Says 50 Percent of U.S. Drug Offenders Unpunished </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The former drug chief of the U.
S. Olympic Committee (USOC) has claimed that half of all American
athletes who tested positive for banned substances went unpunished
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Wade Exum, who resigned as the USOC's director of drug control
administration on June 5 this year, plans to pursue the accusation
in a federal lawsuit expected to be filed next month. He had
worked for the USOC for the past nine years.
</P>
<P>
USOC denied the claim in Denver on Wednesday. "We find it
incredible that the individual charged with the direction and the
success of our own drug program now is criticizing it and
challenging its effectiveness," USOC spokesman Mike Moran said.
</P>
<P>
"He's going to have to back up those allegations with facts,
and we expect to be able to effectively deal with those
allegations," Moran added.
</P>
<P>
Exum said he had become a "racial token" subjected to a hostile
and intolerable working environment. In the resignation letter he
also said the USOC encouraged the doping of athletes without
regard to their health.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday Exum and his lawyers issued a news release, saying:
"In recent years, absolutely no sanction has been imposed on
approximately 50 percent of all the American athletes who have
tested positive for prohibited substances."
</P>
<P>
Exum's lawsuit also is expected to include claims he was asked
to take part in a project that involved testing prohibited
substances on humans "using a protocol that amounted to racial
profiling."
</P>
<P>
Exum also complained his authority was undermined by having to
work under the supervision of Jim Page, currently the USOC's
managing director of sport development. Page was banned from the
U.S. Skiing Association after he confessed to approving a blood-
doping plan for a U.S. Nordic skier in 1987 but was reinstated by
the U.S. Skiing Association in 1990.
</P>
<P>
It is still unknown what kind of damages Exum will ask for in
his lawsuit.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Cricket to Earn Test Status on June 26 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh is expected to be named
as the tenth Test playing nation of the cricket world on June 26,
The New Nation newpaper reported here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The International Cricket Council (ICC) Board, which will meet
on June 24 to 26, will formally announce their decision on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has already got commitments from eight full members
out of nine in support of its bid for the Test status.
</P>
<P>
"We are optimistic to get the Test status on June 26 at the
conference of the ICC," President of Bangladesh Cricket Board
Saber Hossain Chowdhury said.
</P>
<P>
India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe and the West Indies backed
Bangladesh at last June's meeting of ICC Board. Three nations,
namely Australia, south Africa and New Zealand, who opposed the
move at that meeting, have already extended their full support to
the country.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh, now short of just one vote to earn the Test status,
is seeking the support of England.
</P>
<P>
The president said that after getting the Test status,
Bangladesh would take up a ten-year plan in two phases:
development both at grass-root level and at international level.
</P>
<P>
"Our plan is to go up to fifth or sixth position at world level
in next ten years as well as to hold the World Cup 2011 in
cooperation with India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka," Chowdhury said.

<HEADLINE> 250,000 Lakers Fans Turn Out Celebrating NBA Champions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 21 (Xinhua) -- A quarter-million Los Angeles
Lakers fans came out Wednesday to celebrate the new NBA champions
in an adoring sea of purple and gold.
</P>
<P>
They heard speeches from the mayor, promises of more titles and
a pledge from their biggest star to try to undo some of the damage
from Monday night's violence.
</P>
<P>
A mob looted stores, smashed windows and torched police cars
and news vans outside the arena after the Lakers defeated the
Indiana Pacers 116-111 for the NBA crown. Eleven people were
arrested and four police officers were hurt.
</P>
<P>
Police vowed zero tolerance for parade violence and a highly
visible force of more than 300 officers was stationed along
Figueroa Street in downtown Los Angeles to keep the parade
peaceful.
</P>
<P>
There were no arrests and no trouble reported Wednesday.
Lakers receive a hero's welcome.
</P>
<P>
"This is a festive event. If there was some type of problem,
we'd be ready," police Lt. Horace Frank said. He estimated the
crowd at about 250,000.
</P>
<P>
Lakers' head coach Phil Jackson got a huge ovation when he
joined the Lakers on stage outside the Department of Water and
Power building prior to the parade kickoff. At least seven
helicopters buzzed overhead.
</P>
<P>
"We appreciate this a lot. This is for the city of L.A. We
are starting a new millennium right now," Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Richard Riordan declared it Laker Day in the city
celebrating its first NBA championship in 12 years and a
skywriting plane spelled out "LA Lakers" overhead.
</P>
<P>
"What a great day," Riordan said to the wildly cheering throng.
"You are the first champions of the 21st century, the start of a
great dynasty. But most of all, you are No. 1 in the hearts of
all Angelenos."
</P>
<P>
Then, it was time for Shaquille O'Neal, the 7-foot-1 center who
swept Most Valuable Player honors in the regular season, the All-
Star Game and the playoffs. The crowd chanted "MVP! MVP! MVP!"
</P>
<P>
"I want to be known as 'The Big Shakespeare,'" O'Neal said. "
Because it was Shakespeare that said, 'Some men are born great,
some achieve greatness, some have greatness thrust upon them,' and
it was great doing it this year for the city and for everybody
else. And we're going to try to get one next year. I love you."
</P>
<P>
Sunshine bathed the jubilant crowd on the first full day of
summer. Many wore purple-and-gold Lakers colors and hoisted signs
reading "Honk for Kobe Bryant," "Lakers rule 2000," "AC Green,
Will you marry me?" and "Bling Bling."
</P>
<P>
"Bling Bling" was O'Neal's explanation for the sound made when
light bounces off a diamond NBA championship ring.
</P>
<P>
Five open-air, double-deck buses carried the team, politicians,
family members and the Lakers Girls down Figueroa Street through a
blizzard of confetti to the Staples Center. Players blew kisses,
fans blew horns. Everyone waved, smiled and cheered.
</P>
<P>
There were a few minor incidents after the parade Wednesday,
police officer Dan Cox said. A group of young men, many wearing
Lakers' jerseys, pounded on a bus and stole food from a catering
truck 12 blocks south of the arena before police rounded them up.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Help Pay for New Police Cars Damaged in Fans' Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Shaquille O'Neal said
Wednesday that he will pay to replace one of two police cars
torched by rowdy fans celebrating the Los Angeles Lakers' NBA
championship Monday night.
</P>
<P>
"The other night after the game, a couple of bad things
happened, a couple of people trashed two police cars. So on
behalf of the Lakers and (coach) Phil Jackson, we're going to get
them two new police cars," O'Neal told 250,000 Lakers fans, who
turned out Wednesday to celebrate the Lakers' first NBA
Championship since 1988.
</P>
<P>
"We want to say that when we get one (championship) next year,
we just want to be safe, we want everybody to be safe and do the
right thing because we're going to get one next year, too," O'
Neal added.
</P>
<P>
The Lakers and owner Jerry Buss will chip in with Staples
Center to replace the other police vehicle that was burned outside
the arena, Lakers spokesman John Black said Tuesday. Fully
equipped police vehicles can cost around 50,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
A mob looted stores, smashed windows and torched police cars
and news vans outside the arena after the Lakers defeated the
Indiana Pacers 116-111 for the NBA crown. Eleven people were

</P>
<P>
Sources close to the Lakers say that O'Neal, the 7-foot-1, 330-
pound center who capped his first championship season by winning
the NBA Finals MVP award, is very active in the community,
particularly in children's programs. He participates in Shaq Paq,
Wish Kids, Shaqsgiving and Shaq-a-Claus. He also is a spokesman
for Reading is Fundamental.

Chinese archaeologists have discovered a site of Qijia Culture
in northwest China's Qinghai Province.
</P>
<P>
The Qijia Culture flourished in the transition period from the
Neolithic Age to the Bronze Age, some 3,500 to 4,000 years ago,
according to the Qinghai Provincial Archaeological Research
Institute.

Booming Tourism Threatens Mogao Grottoes: Expert
</P>
<P>
Fan Jinshi has devoted half of her life to Dunhuang studies.
After decades of working on manuscripts and books and burying
herself in archives, she is now turning to computers to preserve
the famous Mogao caves located in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old director of the China Dunhuang Studies
Institute envisages people being able to see the caves with the
help of CD ROMS and by doing so preserve some of the most precious
and priceless Buddhists artifacts in the world.
</P>
<P>
"Although the world's most advanced technology is being used to
protect the Mogao Grottoes, the caves are nonetheless
deteriorating amidst booming tourism in the area," said Fan.
</P>
<P>
This year marks the centennial anniversary of the discovery of
the Mogao caves located in Gansu Province along the trade route
known as the "Silk Road".
</P>
<P>
Secluded Grottoes to Open to Visitors
</P>
<P>
The Yunlin Grottoes, a major yet secluded part of the renowned
Dunhuang Caves in the northwest China province of Gansu, are
expected to open to visitors soon.
</P>
<P>
With a five-year consolidation project costing over seven
million yuan nearing its end, the grottoes are expected to first
open to visitors as part of a series of activities to be held to
mark the 100th anniversary of the discovery of the Sutras Cave at
Dunhuang.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the resplendent and magnificent frescoes in the
Mogao Grottoes, the murals in the Yulin Grottoes are simple and
elegant. Different in general tone as they are, the two groups of
grottoes are closely related in carving, fresco content and
artistic style, said Wang Wanfu, a deputy director in charge of
preservation work at the Dunhuang Research Academy.

BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- China has adopted a strategy of
developing its vast western areas, making it a key task in the
national economy this year and in the years to come. The following
are major events on western development this week:
</P>
<P>
SW China Improves Environment
</P>
<P>
The environment in southwest China 's Yunnan Province has been
improved, according to a latest government bulletin.
</P>
<P>
According to the bulletin, although 11 percent of lakes in the
province are getting worse, 23.5 percent have improved their
quality of water in the past year.
</P>
<P>
Some famous tourist attractions like the Erhai Lake, the Luguhu
Lake and the Fuxianhu Lake are so clean that their water can be
directly used as drinking water sources, the bulletin said.
</P>
<P>
The upper reaches of the province's major rivers have been
prevented from pollution. Air quality in 59 percent of the
province's cities reported 1st or 2nd class air quality.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing Kicks Off Massive Environmental Project
</P>
<P>
Chongqing Municipality, southwest China, has kicked off a 50
billion yuan environmental project to turn itself into a garden
city in the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
City mayor Bao Xuding said that the project will focus on air
pollution in the urban area, treatment of industrial waste water,
and turning hillside fields into forested land along the Yangtze
River where the gigantic Three Gorges Reservoir will be located.
</P>
<P>
Bao said that the city will build two shelter forests which are
300 to 500 meters wide in the eastern and western urban zones.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing, covering 82,000 square kilometers and with a
population of 30 million, only has an afforestated area of 23
percent, but the soil eroded area accounts for 63 percent of its
total land area, 25 percentage points higher than the national
average.
</P>
<P>
China Builds Largest Botanical Garden in Yunnan
</P>
<P>
China has begun construction of its largest botanical garden in
Xishuangbanna in southwestern Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
This is another major step adopted by China in protecting its
diversified biological resources. The garden will collect plants
species from tropical and subtropical zones worldwide and protect
endangered species.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the garden, jointly sponsored by the Chinese
Academy of Sciences and Yunnan, is set to be completed in 2004. By
then, the garden will have 10,000 plant varieties bred from the
more than 4,000 types of plants in the Xishuangbanna Tropical Zone
Botanical Garden.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Promote Software Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Export Promotion Bureau (EPB) of
Bangladesh has formulated a draft recommendation simplifying the
conditionalities for providing interest-free loan to software
developing firms, the Financial Express reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
For promoting software export, the EPB fixed a criterion for
the firms to get a maximum of 2.5 million taka (50,000 U.S.
dollars) loan without any interest.
</P>
<P>
Last year about 26 firms applied for loans but none of the
firms could fulfill the conditionalities. There were conditions
that a firm must have eight highly qualified computer engineers
who have five years of experiences in the reputed software
development establishments.
</P>
<P>
This condition seemed to be very tough for the loan-seeking
firms. As no firm could meet the condition, the application
scrutiny committee of EPB did not accept application of any firm.
</P>
<P>
Out of this realization, a special committee of EPB on software
has formulated a draft recommendation recently simplifying the
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed new conditions, any loan-seeking firm must
have five software engineers with two years of working experience.

<P>
SINGAPORE, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Thai Foreign Minister Surin
Pitsuwan said here Wednesday that the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF)
member countries have agreed on the entry of the Democratic People
's Republic of Korea (DPRK) into the regional security forum.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after attending the third Coordinating
Meeting of the Thailand-Singapore Civil Service Exchange Program (
CSEP) on Wednesday afternoon, Surin also said the ARF has agreed
to invite the DPRK to attend its meeting in July in Bangkok,
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Surin said the ARF members hold unanimous position on the DPRK'
s application for joining the forum, that is, they welcome
Pyongyang's new membership.
</P>
<P>
Surin, currently Chairman of the ARF Standing Committee, said
he received in May the formal application sent by the DPRK's
Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun in an occasion after the DPRK and
South Korea had announced a summit between leaders of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Surin said the DPRK's participation in the ARF is a logical
development as the country will contribute to the region's
stability and security.
</P>
<P>
Set up in 1994 in Bangkok, the ARF comprises the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and other Asian and Pacific rim
nations, including the United States, China, Japan, Canada, Russia,
Papua New Guinea, Mongolia and India.

QUITO -- Oil production approved Wednesday by the Organization

decisive way the international price of the hydrocarbons of
emerging producers like Ecuador, said Wednesday Ecuadorian expert

A production increase of that magnitude does not necessarily
mean a drop in the prices. There can be a reduction of the values,

<HEADLINE> OPEC Approves 3 Percent Output Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- OPEC approved a deal to lift global
oil supply by three percent, or 708,000 barrels per day (bpd), the
cartel's Secretary-General Rilwanu Lukman announced Wednesday
night here.
</P>
<P>
Through the output hike, the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) intended to cool runaway crude oil
prices. Last week, the prices soared to as high as more than 29 U.
S. dollars per barrel and crude futures once jumped to 34 dollars
per barrel in New York market.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, to be effective as from July 1, raises
production limits for those 10 OPEC members, sanctions-bound Iraq
excluded, to 25.4 million bpd from 24.69 million.
</P>
<P>
Lukman said that OPEC will do whatever it takes to bring prices
down to a reasonable level, which it puts at 25 dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting in March, the cartel had decided that once
crude prices run out of the range of 22 to 28 dollars per barrel
for more than 20 days, it will cut or lift output limits by 500,
000 bpd.
</P>
<P>
So OPEC's move came as predicted since the prices had jumped
over the upper limit of 28 dollars per barrel starting from mid-
May.
</P>
<P>
The United States welcomed OPEC's decision. "I am pleased with
this figure and hopefully, with additional oil from non-OPEC
countries that might be announced soon, that this will be good
news for the American consumer," Reuters quoted U.S. Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson as saying.
</P>
<P>
In early March, under pressure from consumer governments, OPEC
agreed to a seven percent rise in group output in the second
quarter to 24.69 million bpd and the oil price started going down
from its nine-year peak. But the relief did not last long and the
prices again soared over the 30-dollar mark as the peak summer
driving season came.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts here are skeptical that the price will be
cooled down following Wednesday's decision. It is said that before
the agreement, OPEC countries had already increased its output by
500,000 bpd, therefore on July 1 the world market will see but an
extra supply of 200,000 bpd.

<HEADLINE> Serb Residents Clash With International Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 21 (Xinhua) --Serb residents clashed with
international police stationed in Kosobska Mitrovica, a northern
Kosovo town on Wednesday. Nineteen Serb civilians were reportedly
injured, two seriously.
</P>
<P>
According to local media, the clash happened while
international policemen were escorting a group of ethnic Albanians
from a southern Albanian community in the direction of a northern
Serb community.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts broke out after a Serb civilian recognized some of
the Albanians as former members of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA)
, an armed group of extremist ethnic Albanians, and tried to block
their march.
</P>
<P>
The international policemen used tear-gas, grenades and batons
in an attempt to drive off the Serb civilians.
</P>
<P>
A protest rally in front of the local judicial building
reportedly followed the arrest of one Serb. As the incident
escalated, two Serb civilians were seriously injured by shots
fired by international policemen. Five people were injured by
batons, and 12 others received medical attention from inhaling
tear gas.
</P>
<P>
The incident was finally quelled with the help of the
international peacekeeping troops. The Serb civilian arrested was
later released. International peacekeeping soldiers from France
and Russia have since been patrolling the main roads.

Team head surnamed Anta said they had planted some 2.7 million
saplings in the last eight years.

<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese officials and experts
believe that the OPEC decision to increase output may not greatly
pull down the prices of crude oil in the short term.
</P>
<P>
A official with China Petrochemical Corp (Sinopec) was quoted

barrels a day is necessary to ease crude prices, which now stand

<HEADLINE> Survey of Chinese On-line Shoppers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey shows that the
number of Chinese on-line shoppers increased ten-fold from June
1999 to June 2000, with the growth rate faster than that for the
number of netizens, according to the China Economic Times.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted from May 25 to June 5 by six media
organizations including China Central TV and Beijing Youth Daily.
A total of 200 websites and 1,000 people living in 20 provinces,
autonomous regions and municipalities were surveyed.
</P>
<P>
The figures show that China now has more than 600 on-line
stores, selling a wide range of products for people's daily life.
</P>
<P>
Most of the on-line shops are concentrated in Beijing, Shanghai
and Guangzhou, and Beijing leads all other cities in the service
quality, the survey determined.
</P>
<P>
Beijing-based shop.eguo.com had the speediest delivery, with
goods arriving in less than one hour. The slowest delivery time
was eight days.
</P>
<P>
A similar gap also was seen in prices: Some sites offered low
prices for promotional purposes, and the price difference for the
same product at two sites was as high as 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
The quantity of on-line products has increased at dizzying
speed in the past year, but the variety is limited. Beijing-based
on-line bookstore dangdang.com listed 250,000 books, the most of
any of the monitored e-shops.
</P>
<P>
The survey revealed that 72 percent of shoppers believe on-line
stores are superior in terms of delivery, refund policies, and
follow-up service than traditional stores, while 45 percent of
them agree that when choosing home appliances and IT products,
traditional stores are best.
</P>
<P>
The survey concluded that B2C on-line stores have a broad
development prospect. The data showed that 21 percent of the
netizens had on-line shopping experience and another 33 percent
were willing to give on-line shopping a try.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-seven percent said that they will wait to test on-line
shopping when delivery methods improve and security measures are
heightened.

this saved 106 billion yuan of costs for related families and the
state as well.
</P>
<P>
Henan is now home to 93.87 million people. "We still face
population problems because we have a high population base," Vice-
governor Li Zhibin said.
</P>
<P>
Even with a low population growth rate, Henan's population will
continue to increase by 1.2 million annually in the following
decade, he said, adding that rural population accounts for more
than 80 percent of the provincial total.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the provincial government has begun to provide
better family planning services in a bid to keep a low population
growth rate and improve population quality.

<HEADLINE> Fresh Clash in Indonesia's Maluku Province Kills Five </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Five persons, including a police
officer, were killed when armed villagers attacked a police
housing complex in Ambon, capital of Indonesia's Maluku province,
on Wednesday, according to the Jakarta Post Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted witnesses as saying that residents from the
predominantly Muslim Galunggung area in Ambon raided the police
complex in Tantui, setting fire to houses and two churches.
</P>
<P>
The dead officer was identified as Maj. Edi Sutanto, chief of
the local Mobile Brigade. He was shot in the back.
</P>
<P>
One of the four civilian casualties was a three-and-a-half-year-
old child.
</P>
<P>
The reason behind the latest attack was not clear, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
In North Maluku province, three people were killed as soldiers
beat back Christian villagers trying to exact revenge against
Muslims for Monday's clashes in Duma village in Halmahera island,
which left 152 people dead.
</P>
<P>
Local Christians deplored the participation of the Jihad Force
sent from Java island for the latest incident in Halmahera.
</P>
<P>
"It's clear that members of the Jihad Force were involved. We
want to be left alone ... We wish outsiders would leave Maluku.
Why isn't the government doing anything about it?" Rev. S.S. Duan
of Synode Masehi Injil Halmahera Church was quoted by the paper as
saying.
</P>
<P>
In Yogyakarta, Central Java, Jihad Force spokesman Ayip
Syafruddin confirmed the participation of his men in the Duma
clash.
</P>
<P>
"Members of the Jihad Force fought with other Muslims in trying
to repossess their property which was seized by Christians. We
were simply defending ourselves," he said.
</P>
<P>
In Jakarta, Defense Minister Juwono Sudarsono said supporters
of former president Soeharto, rather than the Soeharto clan itself,
were behind the violence in Maluku and North Maluku, including in
financing and supplying arms to the rioters.
</P>
<P>
The minister said people with strong financial backing had been
fanning the conflicts in the hope of destabilizing the
administration of President Abdurrahman Wahid.
</P>
<P>
He fell short of naming any person or organization but said the
government could not arrest them in the absence of any concrete
evidence.
</P>
<P>
"These people use 'cell systems', sending money through
middlemen. It's difficult to catch them," he added.
</P>
<P>
North Maluku and Maluku provinces have been witnessed nearly
two years of religious and ethnic violence involving Muslims and
Christians. The number of people killed and wounded in both
provinces now runs into thousands.

<HEADLINE> Romania, China Stress Further Enhancement of Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Romania firmly supports China's
principled stand in the issues of Taiwan and Tibet, said Romanian
President Emil Constantinescu Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Romanian-Chinese relations are of special importance,"
President Constantinescu said during a cordial meeting here with
Buhe, vice chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC). He added that China is the first country he
visited after taking office more than three years ago.
</P>
<P>
Vice Chairman Buhe conveyed Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
cordial greetings to President Constantinescu, saying that he
appreciated Romania's long-term position in supporting China's
policy of "One China."
</P>
<P>
"Romania is China's important and reliable partner in Middle
and Eastern Europe," Buhe said, hoping that such good relations
will continue to develop further.
</P>
<P>
After expressing his heart-felt thanks for Chinese President
Jiang Zemin's greetings, the Romanian president asked Vice
Chairman Buhe to convey his good wishes and cordial greetings to
President Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of Romanian-Chinese diplomatic ties
some 50 years ago, President Constantinescu said bilateral
relations "have been developing smoothly" and that visits by
officials from the two countries have given an impetus to the
development of improved relations.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian president called for more expansion in bilateral
business ties in the years ahead and hoped that the two countries
could make greater efforts to expand bilateral economic relations
and trade to meet the greater demands and development of the on-
going market-oriented economy.
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy to see more close exchanges between the CPPCC and
the Romanian parliament," he said. Legislative organizations of
the two countries should also make more regulations improving the
investment climate in their respective countries to help further
economic trade, he added.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC delegation headed by Vice Chairman Buhe will return
home Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Soil Erosion Top Northwest China Environmental Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Soil erosion is the most serious
problem now troubling northwest China, according to noted Chinese
experts.
</P>
<P>
The experts, who have been researching the area's environmental
conditions for several years said that soil erosion had affected
an area of 454,000 sq km in the Loess Highlands, resulting in
creeping desertification, which is a great threat to the local
economy.
</P>
<P>
There are only some 100,000 sq km of oases in 2.88 million sq
km of arid land around the inland rivers in northwest China, they
said.
</P>
<P>
To improve the situation, the area around 33 tributaries of the
Yellow River, totaling 190,000 sq km, has been given priority in
checking the soil erosion. And, another 120,000 sq km of land in
the area will be added into the soil erosion controlled area by
the year 2010, local officials said.

<P>
The world-famous Life of King Gesar, a long and valuable heroic
epic created by the Tibetan people over a considerable long period
of time, is a rare literary treasure of China and the entire world.
However, it has all along been passed down by folk artists orally.
To better protect it, the regional authorities set up special
bodies in 1979 for the collection, research, editing and
publishing of the Life of King Gesar. The state placed it on the
key scientific research project lists of the Sixth, Seventh and
Eighth Five-Year Plans. After 20 years of effort, nearly 300
handwritten or block-printed Tibetan volumes have been collected.
Among them, except 100 variant volumes, about 70 volumes have been
formally published in the Tibetan language, with a total print run
of well over three million copies. Thus, this epic, which had for
long centuries been known only to a few folk artists, has come out
as a systematically complete literary masterpiece that is called "
the king of world epics." In addition, over 20 volumes of the
Chinese edition have been published, and some have been translated
into English, Japanese and French, and distributed all over the
world. This was an unprecedented achievement in protecting the
Tibetan literary and art heritage, as well as in publishing
history.
</P>
<P>
Modern Tibetan literature and art have developed greatly in the
process of combining with the traditional formats, styles and
characteristics. After the peaceful liberation of Tibet, a group
of literary and art workers from different ethnic groups went into
the thick of life in Tibet to explore and inherit the fine aspects
of the local literature and art tradition. They created a lot of
poems, novels, songs, dances, fine art works, films and photos,
introducing new literary and artistic ideas and creation
experience to the then closed or semi-closed parts of Tibet. A
large number of Tibetan intellectuals loving literature and art
joined the new ranks of literary and art workers, and created a
batch of modern works with distinctive ethnic features.
Particularly after the Democratic Reform in 1959, a number of
excellent literary and art works emerged in Tibet and, to a
certain degree, influenced people both at home and abroad. These
works include the songs "On the Golden Hill of Beijing" and "
Liberated Serfs Sing," the song with actions "Strolling Around the
New Town," the song and dance combination "Washing Clothes," the
dance epic with music "Emancipated Serfs Turn Toward the Sun," the
drama "Princess Wen Cheng" and the movie "The Serfs." Over the
past half century, professional literary and art workers in Tibet
have created and performed a total of 569 literary and art works
and theatrical programs with distinctive ethnic features and a
strong feel of the times, of which 51 have won national awards,
and 121 regional awards. In the past five years, professional
theatrical troupes in Tibet have presented 4,887 performances,
attracting audiences totaling 2.79 million. In addition, they have
presented over 400 performances for ordinary people every year. (

Popular culture and art have developed energetically. Beginning
in 1959, the emancipated serfs set up amateur song and dance and
Tibetan opera teams one after another in cities and townships.
They composed, wrote and performed a number of programs reflecting
the people's new life since the liberation in the forms loved by
the masses. In 1963, Tibet, for the first time, held a regional
popular theatrical festival, and formed a delegation to
participate in the National Amateur Theatrical Festival of Ethnic
Minorities in Beijing. The delegation performed a number of
excellent programs with new contents and distinctive ethnic
characteristics, displaying the new level of popular literary and
artistic creation. In the past five years, with the support of the
Central People's Government and other autonomous regions,
provinces and municipalities, Tibet has intensified its efforts
for the construction of cultural facilities, investing a total of
140.46 million yuan in this sphere. So far, Tibet has constructed
more than 400 mass art centers, where rich recreational and sports
activities of diverse forms can be carried out. The Tibet Library
was opened in July 1996, and has been visited by over 100,000
Tibetan readers so far. Now Tibet has 17 mobile performance teams
and some 160 amateur theatrical performance teams and Tibetan
opera teams at the county level. These teams always perform for
the people of the farming and pastoral areas, and are very popular
there. Many of their performances have won awards at national or
regional theatrical festivals. In addition, the various
prefectures, cities and counties hold mass theatrical festivals
from time to time to promote popular cultural activities. On the
traditional Tibetan Shoton Festival in recent years, Tibetan opera
and song and dance performances have been given in Tibet, together
with a wide range of other colorful traditional cultural
activities of popular appeal. Lhozhag County, Biru County, Chenggo
Township in Gonggar County, Jiongriwuqi Township in Ngamring
County and Gyangze County, which are famous for their Tibetan
opera, song and dance performances, folk plastic art, folk dances,
Tibetan opera and Tibetan carpets, respectively, have received
official recognition from the state, which invested over 2.6
million yuan to construct the state-level cultural garden for
rural children in Doilungdeqen County and established the Tibet
Children's Art Ensemble in 1996. The Tibet Children's Art Ensemble
has performed twice in Beijing, and participated in the
International Children's Art Festival in the United States in 1998,
both times with great success. From 1995 to 1999, a total of 40
professional and amateur art ensembles made up of 360 people were
sent by the Tibet Autonomous Region to perform or hold exhibitions
in or conduct academic exchanges with more than 20 countries and
regions worldwide, and wherever they went, they were
enthusiastically welcomed.

Great achievements have also been made in the collection and
collation of Chinese documents and historical materials relating
to Tibetan studies. A total of over 200 works in more than five
million copies have been compiled and published, producing a great
impact both at home and abroad, and providing rich evidence and
reliable historical materials for research in Tibetology, the
history of Han-Tibetan relations, and the history of the relations
between the central and Tibetan local authorities. Extensive
academic exchanges and cooperation have been carried out between
Tibetologists in China and foreign countries, with China receiving
more than 200 foreign experts and scholars, and often sending
experts and scholars to other countries to give lectures and carry

Tibetan medicine and pharmacology, with distinctive Tibetan
characteristics, occupies an important position in traditional
Tibetan culture, and forms a unique part of the treasure-house of
Chinese medicine and pharmacology. However, there were only two
medical organs in Tibet before 1959-the "Mantsikhang" (Institute
of Tibetan Medicine and Astrology) and the "Chakpori Zhopanling" (
Medicine King Hill Institute for Saving All Living Beings) in
Lhasa, the conditions at which were very simple and crude. They
had a combined floor space of only 500 square meters for the
outpatient clinics and a total staff of fewer than 50. They
handled 30-50 outpatients a day, and mainly served the nobles,
feudal lords and upper-strata lamas.

The state has allocated over 800 million yuan to promote the
development of Tibetan medicine and pharmacology since Tibet
carried out the Democratic Reform over 40 years ago, giving a
great boost to this sector. At present, there are a total of 14
Tibetan medical institutions in Tibet, and over 60 county-level
hospitals have established Tibetan medicine sections. In 1959, the
working personnel involved in Tibetan medicine in Tibet numbered
only 434, while in 1999 the number had increased to 1,071,
including 61 chief physicians and associate chief physicians, 166
attending physicians and 844 resident physicians and doctors. The
"Mantsikhang" and "Chakpori Zhopanling" have been amalgamated to
become the Tibet Autonomous Regional Hospital of Tibetan Medicine,
with a floor space of over 100,000 square meters and a staff of
438, of whom 290 are health technicians. The hospital has 250 beds
and provides free medical care for the broad masses of the Tibetan
people, receiving 230,000 outpatients annually. The hospital has
set up outpatient and inpatient departments, a pharmaceuticals
factory, and research institutes of Tibetan medicine, astronomy
and the calendar. It has a department of medicine, surgical
department, department of gynecology and obstetrics, tumor
department, gastrointestinal department and department of
pediatrics to cater to outpatients. In addition, it has set up
more than 20 special outpatient departments, such as the
department for disease prevention and health protection, oral
hygiene department, ophthalmological department and department of
external Tibetan therapeutic medicine, and some modern medical and
technical departments such as the departments of radiation,
ultrasonic wave examination, electrocardioscopy and gastroscopy.
The hospital has adopted the method of combining Western and
Tibetan medicine to treat diseases, thereby enriching and
developing Tibetan medical therapies and theories.
</P>
<P>
Due attention has been paid to scientific research and
education concerning Tibetan medicine. Tibetan medical
institutions at all levels are actively carrying out scientific
research on Tibetan medicine, and have collected and collated
nearly 100 related documents and monographs. New achievements have
been made in studies relating to the history of Tibetan medicine,
medical documents, pharmacological theories, medical ethics, the
inheritance of the teachings of the masters, and Tibetan materia
medica. Thirty-two monographs have been published, including the
Four Medical Classics (Tibetan-Chinese bilingual edition), Blue
Glaze, A Complete Collection of Wall Charts of the Four Medical
Classics, Diagnostics of Tibetan Medicine, Newly Compiled Tibetan
Medicaments and Biographies of Famous Tibetan Doctors. The College
of Tibetan Medicine has trained 615 qualified personnel of various
levels and categories since it was established 10 years ago. The
production of Tibetan medicine has been put on a standardized,
normalized and scientific administration track. The Tibetan
Pharmaceuticals Factory of the Tibet Autonomous Region, one of a
dozen similar factories in Tibet, has two production lines,
turning out over 110 varieties of products and boasting an annual
output value of 46.1 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan medicine is now taking its place in the world, arousing
the attention of international medical circles. Many foreign
experts and scholars come to Tibet every year to study Tibetan
medicine. Tibetan medicine and pharmacology has also been
introduced to the United States, Britain and Germany, and some
countries have sent students to Tibet to study Tibetan medicine.
With the development and progress of the times, the old science of
Tibetan medicine and pharmacology is now full of vigor and
vitality, playing an important role in improving the health
conditions of the Tibetan people and bringing benefits to mankind
as a whole.

<HEADLINE> Full Text of White Paper on Tibetan Culture (16) VI. Popular Education Makes a Historic Leap  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There were no proper schools in old Tibet. Monasteries
monopolized education, and there were only a few government
schools for training only clerical and secular officials, where
most of the students were children of the nobility. The masses of
serfs and slaves had no chance to receive education at all and
illiterate persons accounted for 95 percent of their total number.
Less than 300 students studied in the state-run Lhasa Primary
School, which was established by the Ministry of Education of the
National Government in 1937, even during its period of full bloom,
and only 12 students graduated from higher primary school during
its 10 or so years of operation.
</P>
<P>
The People's Government of the Tibet Autonomous Region has
always regarded it as an important task to develop popular
education to enhance the scientific and cultural qualities of all
the Tibetans since Tibet carried out the Democratic Reform. To
guarantee the people's right to receive education in accordance
with the law, the autonomous region promulgated for implementation
the Measures of Compulsory Education in the Tibet Autonomous
Region and A Plan for Compulsory Education in the Tibet Autonomous
Region in 1994, and adopted a policy which favored investment in
education, providing in explicit terms that the proportion of
education to either its annual financial budget or annual
investment plan in capital construction should reach 17 percent.
The investment in education within the local budget totaled 1.03
billion yuan from 1990 to 1995. At present, a fairly complete
educational system has taken initial shape in Tibet. The teaching
and administrative staff have reached 22,279, among whom 19,276
are full-time teachers, and the teachers of ethnic minorities,
with most being Tibetans, account for over 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
Education in Tibet has made great strides. According to
statistics, Tibet now boasts 820 primary schools, 101 middle
schools and 3,033 teaching centers, with a total enrollment of 354,
644 in primary and middle schools, including 34,756 junior middle
school students and 9,451 senior middle school students within the
region itself. The enrollment ratio of school-age children has
reached 83.4 percent. A three-year compulsory education system has
been popularized in pastoral areas; in agricultural areas, six
years; and in major cities and towns, nine years. Sixteen
secondary vocational schools have been set up in the region, and
the number of students attending such schools both within and
outside Tibet has reached 8,161. With the development of adult
education, the illiteracy rate of Tibetan young and middle-aged
people declined from 95 percent before 1951 to 42 percent in 1999.
Higher education has also been developed rapidly. Tibet has now
established four universities-the Tibet Ethnic Institute, Tibet
Institute of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry, Tibet University,
and Tibet College of Tibetan Medicine, with a total enrollment of
5,249.
</P>
<P>
In the last few decades in Tibet, over 20,000 students have
graduated from universities, and more than 23,000 from secondary
vocational schools. Some Tibetans have received master's or doctor
's degrees. A large number of Tibetan professionals have thus been
trained, including scientists, engineers, professors, doctors,
writers and artists.

Tibet's broadcasting, film and television industries have also
been developed gradually since its peaceful liberation. The Lhasa
Cable Broadcasting Station was established in 1953; wireless
broadcasting was started in 1958; the Tibet People's Broadcasting
Station was formally founded in 1959; black-and-white and color
television programs were trial-broadcast in 1978 and 1979,
respectively; the Tibet Television was established formally in
1985; and the project of the Production Center of the Tibet Dubbed
Radio and Television Programs was put in use in 1995. In the last
four decades and more, the state and the autonomous region have
invested a total of 530 million yuan in Tibet's radio, film and
television industries. The Central Government as well as provinces
and municipalities have also given their support to Tibet by
supplying it with a large number of equipment and materials, more
than 200 technicians and cadres in five groups, and training a
galaxy of broadcasting, film and television professionals for it.
At present, Tibet has two radio broadcasting stations, 36 medium-
and short-wave radio transmitting and relay stations, 45 county-
level FM relay stations, two wireless television stations, 354
television relay stations and 1,475 ground satellite stations,
bringing radio and TV programs to 65 and 55 percent of the people
in Tibet, respectively, and TV programs to 75 percent of the
residents in Lhasa and its vicinity. Seeing films is one of the
main cultural activities of the broad masses of people in
agricultural and pastoral areas. Tibet now has 436 cinemas, 650
grassroots film projection teams and over 9,300 projection centers,
giving more than 130,000 movie shows to 28.5 million people
annually, averaging at least one show per farmer or herdsman per
month. Films are dubbed in Tibetan in agricultural and pastoral
areas so that farmers and herdsmen can understand them. Radio,
film and television have become indispensable parts of the
cultural lives of the people of various ethnic groups in Tibet. (

Conclusion
</P>
<P>
Over the past four decades and more, Tibet has made much
headway in carrying forward the fine aspects of its traditional
culture, while maintaining Tibetan cultural traits, which is
revealed prominently in the following aspects: First, the main
body of Tibetan culture, which was monopolized by a small handful
of feudal serf-owners in the past, has been changed completely,
and the entire Tibetan people have become the main body jointly
carrying forward and developing Tibetan culture and sharing its
fruits; second, Tibetan culture has undergone deep changes-with
social progress and development, decadent and backward things
inherent in feudal serfdom have been abandoned, the religious
beliefs of Tibetan religious followers enjoy full respect and
protection, and the fine aspects of traditional Tibetan culture
have been carefully preserved and carried forward. Improvement has
been steadily made both in its contents and forms, adding some
topical contents to reflect the new life of the people and the new
needs o f social development; and third, a substantive shift has
taken place in the development stance of Tibetan culture, from the
self-enclosed, stagnating and shrinking situation to a new stance-
the stance of opening-up and development oriented to modernization
and the outside world. While developing and promoting its
traditional culture, Tibet is also developing modern scientific
and technological education and news dissemination at an
unprecedented rate.
</P>
<P>
It deserves careful reflection that, although Tibetan culture
is developing continuously, the Dalai Lama clique is clamoring all
over the world that "Tibetan culture has become extinct," and, on
this pretext, is whipping up anti-China opinions with the backing
of international antagonist forces. From the 40-odd years of
history following the Democratic Reform in Tibet it can be clearly
perceived that what the Dalai clique is aiming at is nothing but
hampering the real development of Tibetan culture.

<P>
First, as a social ideology, culture varies with the changes in
the other parts of the social economic foundation and
superstructure. The formation and development of modern Western
culture are inseparable from the modern European bourgeois
revolution, in which the dictatorial system of feudal serfdom and
theocracy in the Middle Ages was eliminated, along with the
religious reforms and great changes in the ideological and
cultural fields caused by it. The development of Tibetan culture
in the last four decades and more has been achieved in the course
of the same great social change marked by the elimination of
feudal serfdom under theocracy that was even darker than the
European system in the Middle Ages. With the elimination of feudal
serfdom, the cultural characteristics under the old system, in
which Tibetan culture was monopolized by a few serf-owners was
bound to become "extinct," and so was the old cultural autocracy
marked by theocracy and the domination of the entire spectrum of
socio-political life e by religion, which was an inevitable
outcome of both the historical and cultural development in Tibet.
Because without such "extinction," it would be impossible to
emancipate and develop Tibetan society and culture, the ordinary
Tibetan people would be unable to obtain the right of mastering
and sharing the fruits of Tibet's cultural development, and it
would be impossible for them to enjoy real freedom, for their
religious beliefs would not be regarded as personal affairs.
However, such "extinction" was fatal to the Dalai Lama clique, the
chief representatives of feudal serfdom, for it meant the
extinction of their cultural rule. Therefore, it is not surprising
at all that they clamor about the "extinction of traditional
Tibetan culture."
</P>
<P>
Second, the development of a culture has never been achieved in
isolation, and it is bound to acquire new contents and forms
ceaselessly with the progress of the times and development of the
society, and nourish and enrich itself while adapting to and
absorbing other cultures. The development of Tibetan culture in
the last four decades and more has been achieved while Tibetan
society is gradually putting an end to ignorance and backwardness,
and heading for reform, opening-up and modernization, and while
Tibetan culture and modern civilization, including modern Western
civilization, are absorbing and blending with each other. The
people's mode of thinking and concepts are bound to change with
the changes of the modes of production and life in Tibet. During
this process, some new aspects of culture which are not contained
in the traditional Tibetan culture but are essential in modern
civilization have been developed, such as modern scientific and
technological education and news dissemination. The fine cult
cultural traditions with Tibetan features are being carried
forward and promoted in the new age, and the decayed and backward
things in the traditional culture that are not adapted to social
development and people's life are being gradually sifted out. It
is a natural phenomenon in conformity with the law of cultural
development, and a manifestation of the unceasing prosperity and
development of Tibetan culture in the new situation. To prattle
about the "extinction of Tibetan culture" due to its acquisition
of the new contents of the new age and to its progress and
development is in essence to demand that modern Tibetan people
keep the life styles and cultural values of old Tibet's feudal
serfdom wholly intact. This is completely ridiculous, for it goes
against the tide of progress of the times and the fundamental
interests of the Tibetan people.
</P>
<P>
At present, as mankind has marched into the new millennium,
economic globalization and informationization in social life are
developing rapidly, increasingly changing people's material and
cultural lives. With the deepening development of China's reform
and opening-up and the modernization drive, especially the
practice of the strategy of large-scale development of the western
region, Tibet is striding toward modernization and going global
with a completely new shape, and new and still greater development
will certainly be achieved in Tibetan culture in this process.

<HEADLINE> White Paper Refutes Dalai's Allegation of "Tibet Culture Extinction " (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Information Office of the
State Council said in a white paper today that the Dalai Lama
clique's prattling about the "extinction of Tibet culture" is in
essence to demand that modern Tibetan people keep the life styles
and cultural values of old Tibet's feudal serfdom wholly intact.
</P>
<P>
The so-called extinction "is completely ridiculous, for it goes
against the tide of progress of the times and the fundamental
interests of the Tibetan people," the white paper on the
development of Tibet culture said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past four decades and more, Tibet has made much
headway in carrying forward the fine aspects of its traditional
culture, while maintaining Tibetan cultural traits, it said.
</P>
<P>
According to the government document, such progress is revealed
prominently in the following aspects:
</P>

-- First, the main body of Tibetan culture, which was

<HEADLINE> World's Longest Epic Renascent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Tibetan heroic epic "Life of King
Gesar", the world's longest epic, has regained its golden time,
with a total of print run of over three million copies.
</P>
<P>
"This epic, which has for long centuries been known only to a
few folk artists, has come out as a systematically complete
literary masterpiece that is called 'the king of world epics'",
said the White Paper entitled "The Development of Tibetan Culture"
issued by the Information Office of the State Council here today.
</P>
<P>
The world-famous "Life of King Gesar", a rare literary treasure
of China and the whole of mankind, has all along been passed down
by folk artists orally.
</P>
<P>
To better protect it, the Tibet Autonomous Region in southwest
China set up special bodies in 1979 for the collection, research,
editing ad publishing of the epic. The state placed it on the key
scientific research project lists of the Sixth, Seventh and Eighth
Five-Year Plans.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper said that after 20 years of effort, nearly 300
handwritten or block-printed Tibetan volumes of the epic have been
collected. Among them, except 100 variant volumes, about 70
volumes have been formally published in the Tibetan language, with
a total print run of well over three million copies, which was an
unprecedented achievement in protecting the Tibetan literary and
art heritage, as well as in publishing history.
</P>
<P>
This is only one tip of the iceberg, and the regional
authorities have always attached importance to the inheritance and
development of Tibetan culture and art.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper said that as early as in the 1950s, literary
and art workers collected music, dance, folk stories, proverbs ad
folk songs and published some books including "Tibetan Folk Songs".
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, the regional government has assigned survey
teams to make extensive investigation and collection of literary
and art heritage and these efforts resulted in the collection of
some 30 million words of written materials and the publication of
a large amount of video tapes, pictures and books.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper said that a series of collections of Tibetan
ballads, folk songs, opera music and folk stories are now under
compilation and will be published soon.

Foreword
</P>
<P>
China is a united multi-ethnic country. As a member of the big
family of the Chinese nation, the Tibetan people have created and
developed their brilliant and distinctive culture during a long
history of continuous exchanges and contacts with other ethnic
groups, all of whom have assimilated and promoted each other's
cultures. Tibetan culture has all along been a dazzling pearl in
the treasure-house of Chinese culture as well as that of the world
as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The gradual merger of the Tubo culture of the Yalong Valley in
the middle part of the basin of the Yarlung Zangbo River, and the
ancient Shang-Shung culture of the western part of the Qinghai-
Tibet Plateau formed the native Tibetan culture. In the period of
the reign of Songtsen Gampo in the seventh century, Buddhism was
introduced to the Tubo people from the Central Plain of China,
India and Nepal, and gradually developed into Tibetan Buddhism
with its distinctive characteristics. At the same time, the Indian
and Nepalese cultures of South Asia, the Persian and Arabic
cultures of West Asia and especially the Han Chinese culture of
the Central Plain had considerable influence on the development of
Tibetan culture. In the long process of Tibetan cultural
development, Tibetan architecture art and the plastic arts such as
sculpture, painting, decoration and handicrafts, as well as music,
dance, drama, spoken and written language, literature in written
form, folk literature, Tibetan medicine and pharmacology,
astronomy and the calendar all reached very high levels.

Tibet later became a local regime practicing a system of feudal
serfdom under a theocracy, and ruled by a few upper-class monks
and nobles. This ensured that Tibetan Buddhist culture gained the
dominant position in Tibetan culture for a long period of time,
until the Democratic Reform was carried out in 1959. Throughout
this period, a handful of upper-class lamas and aristocrats
monopolized the means of production, culture and education.
Cultural and artistic pursuits were regarded as their exclusive
amusements, while the serfs and slaves, who constituted 95 percent
of the Tibetan population, lived in extreme poverty and were not
guaranteed even the basic right of subsistence, let alone the
right to enjoy culture and education. The long reign of feudal
serfdom under theocracy not only severely fettered the growth of
the productive forces in Tibet, but also resulted in a
hermetically sealed and moribund traditional Tibetan culture,
including cultural relics, historic sites and sites for Buddhist
worship. As for modern science, technology, culture and education,
they did not get any chance to develop at all.
</P>
<P>
After the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949, the
Central People's Government attached great importance to the
protection and development of the fine aspects of traditional
Tibetan culture. The "Seventeen-Article Agreement" on measures for
the peaceful liberation of Tibet signed by the Central People's
Government and the local government of Tibet in 1951 clearly
stipulates: "In accordance with the actual conditions of Tibet,
the spoken and written Tibetan language and school education will
be progressively developed." In 1959, with the support of the
Central Government, Tibet carried out the Democratic Reform to
abolish the feudal serf system and liberate the million serfs and
slaves, and implemented the ethnic regional autonomy system there
step by step. This marked the advent of a brand-new era in the
social and cultural development of Tibet, and ended the monopoly
exercised over Tibetan culture by the few upper-class feudal lamas
and aristocrats, making it the common legacy for all the people of
Tibet to inherit and carry on.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and the
Law on Ethnic Regional Autonomy, the Central People's Government
and the People's Government of the Tibet Autonomous Region have
made great efforts in the past 40-plus years to promote the social
and economic development of Tibet, to satisfy the Tibetan people's
increasing needs for rich material and cultural lives. At the same
time, they have devoted large amounts of human, financial and
material resources to protecting and carrying forward the fine
aspects of traditional Tibetan culture, as well as initiating and
developing modern science, culture and education by employing
legal, economic and administrative means. As a result,
considerable achievements attracting worldwide attention have been
attained. All the people in Tibet, as masters of the new era,
jointly carry on, develop and enjoy the traditional Tibetan
culture, and jointly create modern civilized life and culture,
bringing unprecedented prosperity and development to Tibetan
culture.

I. The Spoken and Written Tibetan Language Is Widely Studied
and Used, and Being Developed
</P>
<P>
The Tibet Autonomous Region is an area where Tibetan people
live in concentrated communities, constituting more than 95
percent of the population of the region. In Tibet, the spoken and
written Tibetan language is universally used. In accordance with
the stipulations of the Constitution and the Law on Ethnic
Regional Autonomy, the Tibet Autonomous Region has paid great
attention to maintaining and safeguarding the Tibetan people's
right to study, use and develop their spoken and written language.
It promulgated and implemented Some Provisions of the Tibet
Autonomous Region on the Study, Use and Development of the Spoken
and Written Tibetan Language (Draft) and the Rules for the
Implementation of "Some Provisions of the Tibet Autonomous Region
on the Study, Use and Development of the Spoken and Written
Tibetan Language (Draft)" in 1987 and 1988, respectively. These
two laws put the work related to the study, use and development of
the spoken and written Tibetan language on a legal track. The
governments at all levels in Tibet have implemented the provisions
on protecting and developing the spoken and written Tibetan
language according to law, safeguarding the Tibetan people's right
to study and use their native language, and making the language
develop continuously together with the development of politics,
economy and culture.
</P>
<P>
The spoken and written Tibetan language is widely used in every
aspect of social life in Tibet. Since the Democratic Reform in
1959, the Tibetan and Han Chinese languages have been used for all
the resolutions, laws and regulations adopted by the People's
Congress of the Tibet Autonomous Region, and the official
documents and proclamations issued by the governments at all
levels or their departments in Tibet. In judicial proceedings, the
spoken and written Tibetan language is used in trying cases and in
the relevant legal documents if the litigant participants are
Tibetans. Both the Tibetan and Han Chinese languages are used for
all work units' official seals, certificates, forms, stationery,
and signs, and signboards of institutions, factories, mines,
schools, railway stations, airports, stores and shops, hotels,
cinemas, theaters and gymnasiums, street and road signs, and
traffic signs.

At present, the radio and TV stations in the Tibet Autonomous
Region broadcast in the Tibetan language for over 20 hours per day.
On October 1, 1999, the Tibet Television started its satellite
broadcasting channel, which broadcast telefilms and other programs
in the Tibetan language every day. The cinema is oriented toward
grassroots and farming and pastoral areas, guaranteeing that at
least 25 movies newly dubbed into the Tibetan language are shown
in the various places in Tibet every year. Meanwhile, the
publication of Tibetan books, magazines and newspapers has made
rapid progress. Since 1989 alone, 441 titles of books have been
published in the Tibetan language, of which many have won domestic
or international awards. There are altogether 14 magazines and 10
newspapers published in the Tibetan language in Tibet. The Tibetan
edition of the Tibet Daily is published every day, with a large
number of articles and news dispatches written or edited in the
Tibetan language directly. The newspaper has said good-bye to sort
typesetting by investing a considerable sum of money to establish
Tibetan computer editing and typesetting systems. Both Tibet
Science and Technology News and Tibet Scientific and Technological
Information have their Tibetan-language editions, which are very
popular among the farmers and herdsmen. All the art troupes in
Tibet create programs and perform in the Tibetan language.
</P>
<P>
The study of the Tibetan language is protected by law.
Educational institutions in the Tibet Autonomous Region
universally practice a bilingual educational system whereby
teaching is done principally in the Tibetan language. Furthermore,
the teaching and reference materials for all the courses from
primary school to senior high school have been edited in or
translated into the Tibetan language.
</P>
<P>
As the times progress and society advances, the Tibetan
language develops in tandem, with its vocabulary and grammar
continuously enriched. Much headway has been made in the
normalization of technical terms and standardization of
information technology in the Tibetan language. The encoded
Tibetan language has been formally recognized by the Chinese state
and international standards, and the promotion of the Tibetan
language as an Internet communication tool is proceeding apace.

In 1965, the People's Government of the Tibet Autonomous Region
set up the Cultural Relics Administration Committee to take charge
of the preservation and administration of cultural relics in Tibet.
It named 11 historical sites, such as Ramoche Monastery, Radreng
Monastery and Tsurpu Monastery, as important cultural relic sites
under autonomous region-level protection, and repaired those that
urgently needed repair. Beginning in the 1980s, the Tibet
Autonomous Region has issued successively the Proclamation of the
People's Government of the Tibet Autonomous Region on Improving
the Preservation of Cultural Relics, the Interim Provisions of the
Tibet Autonomous Region on the Administration of Scattered
Cultural Relics, the Regulations of the Tibet Autonomous Region on
the Protection and Administration of Cultural Relics, and the
Measures for the Protection and Administration of the Potala
Palace. These laws and regulations have brought the work of
preserving cultural relics in Tibet within the orbit of
legalization and standardization. At the same time, a large
contingent of cultural relic protection staff has been formed, and
the ranks of such personnel are constantly growing. According to
statistics, there are now more than 270 archeologists in Tibet,
among whom 95 percent are Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
Remarkable achievements have been gained in archeological work
in Tibet. Among them, the excavation of the Karuo ruins, Qamdo,
attracted the attention of archeologists both at home and abroad.
Since the 1970s, China has conducted archeological work
extensively in Tibet and unearthed many Old and New Stone Age
sites, gradually unveiling the mystery of the origins of the
society, history and traditional culture of Tibet. A general
survey made from the mid-1980s to the beginning of the 1990s
discovered 1,700-odd sites of cultural remains, and unearthed and
collected several thousand cultural relics. In addition, over six
million words of archeological documents were edited, along with
670-odd diagrams, more than 30,000 photos were taken, and some 400
pictures of tablet inscriptions, stone statues and murals were
copied. These materials have helped outline the changes and
development of Tibet from ancient to modern times, and revealed
the long-standing cultural exchanges between the Tibetan, Han and
other neighboring ethnic groups. Moreover, they furnish a full and
reliable basis for archeological workers of the present and later
times to better preserve cultural relics and strengthen
archeological work in Tibet. Currently, there are 18 important
cultural relic sites under state-level protection, three famous
historical and cultural cities under state-level protection, 64
cultural relic sites under autonomous region-level protection, and
20-odd cultural relic sites under county- or city-level protection
in Tibet. In recent years, Tibet has successfully held Tibetan
cultural relic exhibitions in Japan, France, Italy, Argentina and
other countries, promoting cultural exchanges between Tibet and
other nations worldwide, and helping the international community
better understand Tibet.

Ancient documents and archives are well preserved in Tibet.
There are enormous numbers of Tibetan-language documents and
archives in various categories, next in number only to the Han-
Chinese language ones. In June 1959, the Preparatory Committee for
the Tibet Autonomous Region, on the instructions of the State
Council, issued Some Provisions on Strengthening the
Administration of Cultural Relics, Historical Sites, Documents and
Archives, and started to edit, preserve, collect and store the
documents and archives of the former local government of Tibet and
its subordinate departments, as well as those collected by
monasteries, temples and aristocrats. As a result, a fairly
complete collection of archives was established. In 1984, the
Central People's Government allocated a large amount of money to
build the new Tibet Autonomous Region Archives, with improved
functions and modern facilities. At present, there are over three
million volumes in the Archives. Large-format books such as A
Selection of Tibetan Historical Archives and An Inventory of the
Year of the Iron-Tiger edited by the Tibet Autonomous Region
Archives have been published, furnishing precious materials for
research. The government institutions at all levels in Tibet have
collected over four million volumes of archives on paper, silk,
wood, metal, stone and Pattra leaf. Among them, more than 90
percent are in Tibetan, and the others in a variety of languages
such as Han Chinese, Manchu, Mongolian, Hindi, Sanskrit, Nepalese,
English and Russian. These archives, which date from the Yuan
Dynasty to contemporary times, constitute a treasure-house of
chronologically complete historical records.

III. Folk Customs and Freedom of Religious Belief Are Respected
and Protected
</P>
<P>
The state respects and safeguards the rights of the Tibetans
and other ethnic groups in Tibet to live their lives and conduct
social activities in accordance with their traditional customs,
and their freedoms to engage in normal religious activities and
major religious and folk festival celebrations. As society
progresses, some decayed, backward old customs despising laboring
people that bear a strong tinge of the feudal serf system have
been abandoned, which reflects the Tibetans' pursuit of modern
civilization and a healthy life as well as the continuous
development of Tibetan culture in the new era. The Tibetan people,
while maintaining their traditions, have greatly enriched their
lives by absorbing many new cultural customs, as displayed in
dress and adornments, diet, residence, weddings and funerals.
There are many traditional festivals and fairs in Tibet, including
the Tibetan New Year, Sakadawa Festival, Ongkor (Bumper Harvest)
Festival, Shoton (Yogurt) Festival, Bathing Festival, Butter Lamp
Festival, Dharma Festival, Burning Offerings Festival, Garchachen
Festival, and Horse Race Fair of Lhasa and the many festivals of
other places. Religious festivals celebrated by monasteries
include the Shimo Chento Festival of Tashilhunpo Monastery, Nganjo
Festival of Ganden Monastery, Collecting Sutras and Religious
Dance festivals of Samye Monastery, July Vajra Festival of Sakya
Monastery, Erecting the Prayer Banner Pole Festival of Tsurpu
Monastery, and Paltung Tanbo Festival of Radreng Monastery. In
addition, the Tibetans also celebrate some national and
international festivals such as International Working Women's Day
(March 8th), International Labor Day (May 1st), Chinese Youth
Festival (May 4th), International Children's Day (June 1st) and
National Day (October 1st). Combining new concepts and the new
culture of modern civilization with the fine aspects of
traditional Tibetan culture, Tibet has formed new customs and
habits with the characteristics of both the ethnic group and the
times.

<P>
The Central People's Government and the government of the Tibet
Autonomous Region have all along paid special attention to respect
for and protection of the freedom of religious belief and normal
religious activities of the Tibetan people. Since the Democratic
Reform, religion-related cultural relics and historical sites,
monasteries and temples have been well preserved at the behest of
both the clerical and secular masses. The Potala Palace, the Three
Grand Monasteries in Lhasa, Jokhang Temple and Tashilhunpo
Monastery in Xigaze have been listed as important cultural relic
sites under state-level protection by the Central Government. The
murals, sculptures, statues, Thangkas (scroll paintings), artistic
decorations, scriptures, offerings, ritual musical instruments and
shrines of Buddha of those monasteries, as well as the scripture
halls, worship halls, monasteries, temples and pagodas, the
carriers of religious culture, have been preserved as far as
possible or have been repaired or restored to their original
condition. Especially beginning in the 1980s, the state has
allocated large amounts of money for the reconstruction of some
famous monasteries, including the Ganden, Yumbulagang and
Sanggagorto monasteries, and the repairing of well-known but
dilapidated monasteries, such as the Samye, Shalu, Sakya,
Changzhug, Qamba Ling and Toling monasteries. The scriptures and
classics of the Potala Palace, the Norbulingka and Sakya Monastery
have been well preserved, with some edited and published as the
Catalogue of the Classics of the Potala Palace, Ancient Books of
the Snowland, and Origin of Religions by Deu. Now, Tibet is home
to more than 1,700 monasteries, temples and other sites of
religious activity, with over 46,000 Buddhist monks and nuns. Each
year, religious activities are held and important religious
festivals are celebrated on schedule in the Autonomous Region. The
Tibet Branch of the Buddhist Association of China, an umbrella
organization of the various sects of Tibetan Buddhism, now has
seven prefecture (city)-level sub-branches, the journal Buddhism
in Tibet in the Tibetan language, an institute of Buddhist
theology and a Tibetan scripture printing house.

<HEADLINE> China to Issue White Paper on Tibetan Culture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- To refute the fallacy of "Tibetan
culture has become extinct" clamored by the Dalai Lama clique, the
Information Office of the State Council will issue a White Paper
entitled "The Development of Tibetan Culture" here today.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper introduces the tremendous development in
promoting the fine aspects of traditional culture and keeping the
ethnic characteristics since the peaceful liberation of Tibet in
1951, especially since the Democratic Reform in 1959, exposing the
ill-intention of the Dalai Lama clique.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper, written in 12,000 Chinese characters, includes
a foreword and seven chapters, elaborating in details how the
Tibetan language has been studied, used and developed, how
cultural relics and ancient books in Tibet have been preserved and
protected, how Tibetan folk customs and freedom of religious
belief have been respected and protected, how Tibetan culture and
art have been inherited and developed as well as new achievements
in Tibetan studies, popular education and in news and publishing,
broadcasting,, film and television industries.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper concludes that at present, "Tibet is striding
toward modernization and going global with a completely new shape,
and new and still greater development will certainly be achieved
in Tibetan culture in this process." And "what the Dalai clique is
aiming at is nothing but hampering the real development of Tibetan
culture".

<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- To refute the prattling of the
Dalai Lama clique that "Tibetan Culture has become extinct," the
Information Office of the State Council released a White Paper on
"the Development of Tibetan Culture" today.
</P>
<P>
Detailing numerous facts and figures, the White Paper, which
runs in 12,000 Chinese characters, said that over the past four
decades and more, Tibet has made much headway in carrying forward
the fine aspects of its traditional culture, while maintaining
Tibetan cultural traits, and exposed the true political colors of
the Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
Before the 1959 Democratic Reform, Tibet was a local regime
practicing a system of feudal serfdom under a theocracy, and ruled
by a few upper-class monks and nobles, it said.
</P>
<P>
The paper explained that throughout this period, a handful of
upper-class lamas and aristocrats monopolized the means of
production, culture and education and cultural and artistic
pursuits were regarded as their exclusive amusements, while the
serfs and slaves, who constituted 95 percent of the Tibetan
population, lived in extreme poverty and were not guaranteed even
the basic right of subsistence, let alone the right to enjoy
culture and education.
</P>
<P>
After the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949, the
Central People's Government attached great importance to the
protection and development of the fine aspects of traditional
Tibetan culture, the White Paper said.
</P>
<P>
In 1959, with the support of the Central Government, Tibet
carried out the Democratic Reform to abolish the feudal serf
system and liberate the million serfs and slaves, and implemented
the ethnic regional autonomy system there step by step, it noted.
</P>
<P>
"This marked the advent of a brand-new era in the social and
cultural development of Tibet, and ended the monopoly exercised
over Tibetan culture by the few upper-class feudal lamas and
aristocrats, making it the common legacy for all the people o f
Tibet to inherit and carry on," it said.

The document expounded in seven chapters on the government
protection of Tibetan language, cultural relics, ancient books and
records, folk customs and freedom of religion, and on the
development of art, Tibetan studies, Tibetan medicine and
pharmacology, education, and recreational facilities and
institutions in the Tibet Autonomous Region:
</P>
<P>
After the "Cultural Revolution" ended in 1978, the Central
People's Government took prompt measures to repair and protect a
lot of historical relics, investing more than 300 million yuan to
repair and open 1,400-odd monasteries and temples in Tibet. In
particular, between 1989 and 1994, the Central People's Government
allocated 55 million yuan and a great quantity of gold, silver and
other precious materials to repair the Potala Palace, which was
unprecedented in China's history of historical relic preservation.
</P>
<P>
The state respects and safeguards the rights of the Tibetans
and other ethnic groups in Tibet to live their lives and conduct
social activities in accordance with their traditional customs,
and the Central Government and the government of the Tibet
Autonomous Region have all along paid special attention to respect
for and protection of the freedom of religious belief and normal
religious activities of the Tibetan people.
</P>
<P>
Tibet is today home to more than 1,700 monasteries, temples and
other sites of religious activity, with over 46,000 Buddhist monks
and nuns. Each year, religious activities are held and important
religious festivals are celebrated on schedule in the Autonomous
Region.
</P>
<P>
Culture and art are being inherited and developed in an all-
round way. The regional authorities set up special bodies in 1979
for the collection, research, editing and publishing of the Life
of King Gesar, an orally pass-on epic by artists. And after 20
years of effort, nearly 300 handwritten or block-printed Tibetan
volumes have been collected. Among them, except 100 variant
volumes, about 70 volumes have been formally published in the
Tibetan language.
</P>
<P>
"This was an unprecedented achievement in protecting the
Tibetan literary and art heritage, as well as in publishing
history," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
-- Old Tibet had no Tibetan studies in the modern sense, no
proper school, no genuine news and publishing industry, and the
materials printed by the few wood-block printing houses were
almost all scriptures. The only two clinics in Lhasa only served
the nobles, feudal lords and upper-strata lamas. And today,
historic progress has been made in all the fields mentioned above,
and the Tibetan medicine and pharmacology is taking its place in
the world.

<P>
The White Paper said that "it deserves careful reflection that,
although Tibetan culture is developing continuously, the Dalai
Lama clique is clamoring all over the world that 'Tibetan culture
has become extinct,' and, on this pretext, is whipping up anti-
China opinions with the backing of international antagonist forces.
"
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that with the elimination of feudal serfdom, the
cultural characteristics under the old system, in which Tibetan
culture was monopolized by a few serf-owners was bound to become "
extinct," and so was the old cultural autocracy marked by
theocracy and the domination of the entire spectrum of socio-
political life by religion, which was an inevitable outcome of
both the historical and cultural development in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
"To prattle about the 'extinction of Tibetan culture' due to
its acquisition of the new contents of the new age and to its
progress and development is in essence to demand that modern
Tibetan people keep the life styles and cultural values of old
Tibet's feudal serfdom wholly intact," it said
</P>
<P>
"This is completely ridiculous, for it goes against the tide of
progress of the times and the fundamental interests of the Tibetan
people," the White Paper said.
</P>
<P>
With the deepening development of China's reform and opening-up
and the modernization drive, especially the practice of the
strategy of large-scale development of the western region, Tibet
is striding toward modernization and going global with a
completely new shape, and new and still greater development will
certainly be achieved in Tibetan culture in this process, the
White Paper concluded.

<HEADLINE> More Funds Allocated to Renovate Tibetan Temples (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Government has
allocated a total of 300 million (about 36.15 million U.S. dollars)
in funds to renovate and open more than 1,400 Tibetan monasteries
and temples in the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
To date, the Central People's Government allocates four to five
million yuan (482,000-602,410 U.S. dollars) for the cultural
relics protection in Tibet, said the White Paper entitled "The
Development of Tibetan Culture" issued here today.
</P>
<P>
Since the Democratic Reform, the Central People's Government
has attached great importance to the protection of cultural relics
in Tibet. In particular, between 1989 and 1994, the Central People
's Government allocated 55 million yuan and a great quantity of
gold, silver and other precious materials to repair the Potala
Palace, which was unprecedented in China's history of historical
relic preservation.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper said that in May 1994, experts entrusted by the
UNESCO World Heritage Committee inspected the repaired Potala
Palace and said that the design and construction of the repairs
had both attained advanced world levels. They considered it "a
miracle in the history of ancient building protection" and "a
great contribution to the protection of Tibetan, and even world
culture." In December 1994, in view of its importance and
condition of protection the World Heritage Committee unanimously
agreed to place the Potala Palace on the World Heritage List. (

<TEXT>
<P>
As early as in June 1959, the Tibet Cultural Relics, Historical
Sites, Documents and Archives Management Committee was established
to collect and protect a large number of cultural relics, archives,
and ancient books and records.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Central People's Government assigned
work teams to Lhasa, Xigaze and Shannan to conduct on-the-spot
investigations of major cultural relics. A total of nine
historical sites were listed among the first batch of important
cultural relic sites under state-level protection by the State
Council in 1961, including the Potala Palace, Jokhang Temple,
Ganden Monastery, Tibetan King's Tomb, Mount Dzong (Dzongri) Anti-
British Monument in Gyangze County, and the Guge Kingdom ruins.
</P>
<P>
Even in such a special period as the "Cultural Revolution" (
1966-1976), late Premier Zhou Enlai gave instructions personally
that special measures be taken to protect major cultural relics
like the Potala Palace from destruction.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper said that a series of laws and regulations
enacted by the regional government have brought the work of
preserving cultural relics in Tibet within the orbit of
legalization and standardization. At the same time, a large
contingent of cultural relic protection staff has been formed, and
the ranks of such personnel are constantly growing. According to
statistics, there are now more than 270 archeologists in Tibet,
among whom 95 percent are Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper said that ancient documents and archives are
well preserved in Tibet. There are enormous numbers of Tibetan-
language documents and archives in various categories, next in
number only to the Han-Chinese language ones.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are over three million volumes in the
Archives. Large-format books such as A Selection of Tibetan
Historical Archives and An Inventory of the Year of the Iron-Tiger
edited by the Tibet Autonomous Region Archives have been published,
furnishing precious materials for research.
</P>
<P>
The government institutions at all levels in Tibet have
collected over four million volumes of archives on paper, silk,
wood, metal, stone and Pattra leaf. Among them, more than 90
percent are in Tibetan, and the others in a variety of languages
such as Han Chinese, Manchu, Mongolian, Hindi, Sanskrit, Nepalese,
English and Russian.
</P>
<P>
These archives, which date from the Yuan Dynasty to contemporary
times, constitute a treasure-house of chronologically complete
historical records.

quarter-finals, tied in a goalless match in Bruges.
</P>
<P>
France was satisfied with the second spot in the group, though
having their 14-match unbeaten run snapped. The World Champions
sent a powerful warning to all the other quarter-finalists as
their second line-up made the co-hosts struggle for victory.
</P>
<P>
A free-kick thunderbolt from Frank de Boer and a Boudewijn
Zenden run and drive redressed the balance after France built a 2-
1 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch retained home advantage for the knock-out stage where
they are to play Yugoslavia, in a repeat of their last 16 World
Cup encounter, in Rotterdam on Sunday.
</P>
<P>

their base camp in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
France went ahead 1-0 in the eighth minute through a Christophe
Dugarry header as Dutch goalkeeper Sander Westerveld failed to
reach a Johan Micoud corner.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch equalized six minutes later when Dennis Bergkamp fed
Patrick Kluivert to spring the offside trap. Kluivert ran on to
net his 25th international goal, beating Bernard Lama with a
powerful shot.
</P>
<P>
France took over the lead again in the 31st minute as striker
David Trezeguet diverted a corner into the net as the Dutch
appealed for offside.
</P>
<P>
However, Frank de Boer's free kick in the 51st minute and a
59th minute drive from Zenden after the Dutchman had latched onto
a Westerveld long-ball settled the game.

<HEADLINE> Banks Admits England World Cup Chance Bleak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Former British sports minister Tony
Banks admitted Wednesday that England's hopes of staging the 2006
World Cup are looking "very bleak" after the hooliganism of its
fans at Euro 2000.
</P>
<P>
Banks, who is part of the team which has travelled the world
trying to persuade FIFA members to favor England's bid, told BBC
radio that the violence in Brussels and Charleroi, and UEFA's
threat to throw England out of Euro 2000, has harmed its chances.
</P>
<P>
"Ours is accepted by FIFA as the best bid, but it is now
looking very bleak indeed, because of the damage done by the
images flashed round the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he added that hopes of winning the 2006 Finals were not yet
dead: "I have to travel optimistically, and I don't rule it out,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
FIFA's 24-member executive committee meets on 5-6 July to
decide the venue for the tournament in six years time.
</P>
<P>
England, who have not staged the World Cup since 1996, are
competing against Germany, South Africa, Brazil and Morocco.
</P>
<P>
South Africa appear the favorites, and FIFA president Sepp
Blatter has frequently expressed support for taking the finals to
Africa for the first time.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Lenny Wilkens, who has the most
coaching wins in National Basketball Association history,
announced Wednesday that he will take the helm of the Toronto
Raptors.
</P>
<P>
The Raptors, who made the play-offs last season for the first
time in its five-year history, are hoping the 62-year-old Wilkens
can build the young squad into a legitimate contender.
</P>
<P>
Regarded as a "players coach", Wilkens brings to Toronto a 1,
179-981 win-loss record including a 310-232 record in seven years
with the Atlanta Hawks. He has also coached in Portland, Seattle
and Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
Toronto's general manager Glen Grunwald signed Wilkens to a
four-year contract reportedly worth of 20 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Wilkens resigned from his post with the Hawks in April after
the worst season of his 27-year coaching career, which saw the
team post a 28-54 record last season. He had two years remaining
on his contract with Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Wilkens is in the Basketball Hall of Fame as a player and a
coach, making him the only double inductee from the NBA. He was
also voted to the list of the NBA's 50 Greatest Players in 1996
and later named one of the NBA's 10 Greatest Coaches.
</P>
<P>
Raptors' former coach Butch Carter was sacked last week largely
because of his feuding with players.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Hosts the Netherlands rallied
strongly from a 2-1 first half down on Wednesday and outplayed
World Cup holders French 3-2 in a showdown of the leading pair of
Group D in the 2000 European championship.
</P>
<P>
France was satisfied with the second spot in the group, though
having their 14-match unbeaten run snapped. The World Champions
sent a powerful warning to all the other quarter-finalists as
their second line-up made the co-hosts struggle for victory.
</P>
<P>
A free-kick thunderbolt from Frank de Boer and a Boudewijn
Zenden run and drive redressed the balance after France built a 2-
1 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch retained home advantage for the knock-out stage where
they are to play Yugoslavia, in a repeat of their last 16 World
Cup encounter, in Rotterdam on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
France will face Spain in the quarter-final as they can keep
their base camp in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
France went ahead 1-0 in the eighth minute through a Christophe
Dugarry header as Dutch goalkeeper Sander Westerveld failed to
reach a Johan Micoud corner.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch equalized six minutes later when Dennis Bergkamp fed
Patrick Kluivert to spring the offside trap. Kluivert ran on to
net his 25th international goal, beating Bernard Lama with a
powerful shot.
</P>
<P>
France took over the lead again in the 31st minute as striker
David Trezeguet diverted a corner into the net as the Dutch
appealed for offside.
</P>
<P>
However, Frank de Boer's free kick in the 51st minute and a
59th minute drive from Zenden after the Dutchman had latched onto
a Westerveld long-ball settled the game.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Holds Talks with Azerbaijan National  Council Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAKU, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, Chairman of the Standing
Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC), held
talks with Murtuz Aleskerov, chairman of the National Assembly of
Azerbaijan, to discuss cooperation between the two parliaments and
other issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Aleskerov extended a warm welcome to Li, who is on an official
goodwill visit to Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
Aleskerov said since the establishment of diplomatic ties
between the two countries in 1992, their friendly relations have
kept growing.President Geidar Aliyev's 1994 China visit marked a
new era of bilateral relations, he said, adding Li's current visit
to Azerbaijan is also a major event in the history of the two
countries' relations as it will open a new chapter for the
friendly relations between the two countries' parliaments.
</P>
<P>
He said China has played an important role in Asia and in the
world as well, and Azerbaijan highly appreciates China's stand of
upholding justice in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Aleskerov said China's position on respecting independence,
sovereignty and territorial integrity is an important principle in
international relations.
</P>
<P>
He said Azerbaijan also opposes the theory of "human rights
overriding sovereignty," and opposes the creation of separation of
a country or a nation by using this theory. He noted that
Azerbaijan appreciates China's stand on the issue of Azerbaijan's
Nagorno-Karabakh area.
</P>
<P>
Aleskerov said he hopes the two countries will have more
economic cooperation projects in various fields, including in the
oil and natural gas industry.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes for further cooperation between his country's
National Assembly and China's NPC.
</P>
<P>
In response, Li said the Chinese and Azerbaijan peoples have
kept friendly contacts both in the period of the former Soviet
Union and after the independence of Azerbaijan. Exchanges between
the two parliaments have kept growing, he said, adding he hopes
his current visit will contribute to this endeavor.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated China's position on the issue of Azerbaijan'
s Nagorno-Karabakh area, saying that the U.N. Security Council's
resolutions on this problem should be implemented.

ATHENS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas

<HEADLINE> NASA Reports Water on Mars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Imaging scientists using data
from NASA's Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft have observed features
that suggest there may be current sources of liquid water at or
near the surface of the red planet, NASA reported Thursday in a
news release here.
</P>
<P>
"We see features that look like gullies formed by flowing water
and the deposits of soil and rocks transported by these flows."
said Dr. Michael Malin, principal investigator for the Mars
Orbiter Camera on the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft at Malin
Space Science Systems, San Diego, CA.
</P>
<P>
"The features appear to be so young that they might be forming
today. We think we are seeing evidence of a ground water supply,
similar to an aquifer," Marlin said, noting that these are new
landforms that have never been seen before on Mars.
</P>
<P>
The findings will be published in the June 30 issue of Science
magazine.
</P>
<P>
For two decades scientists have debated whether liquid water
might have existed on the surface of Mars just a few billion years
ago for two decades, but with today's discovery, the debate has
moved to present-day Mars, said Dr. Weiler, Associate
Administrator for Space Science, NASA headquarters.
</P>
<P>
"The presence of liquid water on Mars has profound implications
for the question of life not only in the past, but perhaps even
today. If life ever did develop there, and if it survives to be
present time, then these landforms would be great places to look."
Weiler said.
</P>
<P>
The gullies observed in the images are on cliffs, usually in
crater or valley walls, and are made up of a deep channel with a
collapsed region at its upper end and at the other end an area of
accumulated debris that appears to have been transported down the
slope. Relative to the rest of the martian surface, the gullies
appear to be extremely young, meaning they may have formed in the
recent past.
</P>
<P>
"They could be a few million of years old, but we cannot rule
out that some of them are so recent as to have formed yesterday,"
Malin said.
</P>
<P>
The water supply is believed to be about 100 to 400 meters
below the surface, and limited to specific regions across the
planet. Each flow that came down each gully may have had a volume
of water of roughly 2,500 cubic meters, enough to sustain 100
average households for a month.
</P>
<P>
If water is available in substantial volumes in areas other
than the poles, it would make it easier for human crews to access
and use it, for drinking, to create breathable air, and to extract
oxygen and hydrogen for rocket fuel or to be stored for use in
portable energy sources.
</P>
<P>
If confirmed to be true, the discovery will stimulate a new
wave of exploration of Mars and other space research programs, one
NASA scientist said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Democrats Call For Missile Test Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a letter to FBI Director Louis Freeh, 53 Democrats cited
concerns of scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and alleged a cover-up of a failed experiment of the
system.
</P>
<P>
"Public scrutiny of the evidence for these allegations has
recently been greatly impeded by the decision of the Department of
Defense to classify that letter and attachments," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
The Democrats quoted from a New York Times report on the
scientists' letter which said the system could not tell the
difference between warheads and decoys.
</P>
<P>
"The American people need an independent investigation of this
matter to determine if the well-documented and serious allegations
of fraud in the National Missile Defense system are true and if a
cover-up of that fraud has taken place," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said Thursday that
he is "not going to be outraged" if President Bill Clinton leaves
a decision on the system to the next president.
</P>
<P>
Lott is the first high-ranking Republican to suggest that a
delay might be acceptable.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is expected to decide this year whether to break ground
next spring to start building a powerful radar station in Alaska
State in the first phase of an NMD shield to be operational by
2005.
</P>
<P>
The international community has opposed the NMD, which would
either breach or require major changes to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty between the United States and the then Soviet Union,
a cornerstone of arms control.
</P>
<P>
Arms control experts said the U.S. plan to set up the NMD
system runs against the trend of the times and will have a major
adverse impact on global and regional strategic balances and
stability.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft, U.S. Government Agree to Speed Up Supreme Court Filings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft Corp. and the U.S.
Justice Department have agreed to speed up their historic
antitrust battle in a move that could allow the Supreme Court to
decide by September whether to hear the case directly or send it
to a federal appeals court.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the nation's highest court Thursday, Solicitor
General Seth Waxman said Microsoft will file its appeal by July 26,
and that government lawyers will file their response by August 15.
</P>
<P>
Without that schedule, Microsoft would have had until August 14
to file its appeal of a federal judge's order requiring Microsoft
to be split into two companies. The government would have had a
month to respond.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft's appeal will urge the justices to send the case to
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. The
Justice Department wants the Supreme Court to hear the case
directly, under a federal law that allows major antitrust disputes
to skip the appeals court step and move from a trial court to the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
The law gives the Supreme Court the choice of taking on the
case directly or sending it to the appeals court. Thursday's
action means the Supreme Court could announce that choice as early
as mid-September, about a month earlier than usual.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who found
Microsoft violated the nation's antitrust laws and ruled early
this month that the company should be split into two, invoked the
expediting law Monday when he sent the case to the Supreme Court.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Former Nigerian head of state
General Abdul Salam Abubaker on Thursday evening received the
Africa Peace Award for his major role in bringing peace and
stability to his country.
</P>
<P>
Abubaker, who took power after the military ruler Sani Abacha
died in 1998, voluntarily ceded power to the elected President
Olusegun Obasanjo in May 1999, ending 15-year military rule in
Africa's most populous country.
</P>
<P>
The award was handed to Abubaker at a ceremony on the second
day of the three-day Southern African Economic Summit in Durban,
South Africa, sponsored by the World Economic Forum.
</P>
<P>
The prestigious award presented for every two years since 1993
has been billed "Africa's Nobel Peace Prize".
</P>
<P>
The award was the initiative of the African Centre for
Constructive Resolution of Disputes (ACCROD).
</P>
<P>
ACCROD executive director Vaso Gounden said the change brought
about in Nigeria by Abubaker's commitment to peace made a
remarkable impact on the whole of the African continent.
</P>
<P>
The past winners included the Kwazulu-Natal community of
Mpumalanga for peace efforts between the Inkatha Freedom Party
and the African National Congress (1993), Mozambique (1997) and
former South African president Nelson Mandela (1995).
</P>
<P>
The winners of the Africa Peace Award are chosen according to a
strict set of principles: commitment to human rights, the peaceful
settlement of disputes and good governance.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Environment and Natural
Resources Minster Ben Mwila was suspended from the ruling Movement
for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) Thursday for violating party
regulations.
</P>
<P>
Mwila, who is also National Treasurer of the ruling party, has
been given 10 days to exculpate himself, said a disciplinary
letter dated June 22 signed by MMD National Secretary Michael
Sata.
</P>
<P>
In the letter Sata charged that in the past 18 months, Mwila
has been involved in anti-party activities that has greatly
destabilized the party.
</P>
<P>
Mwila provoked the party leadership by announcing his
candidature for the MMD presidency on May 26 as the first step to
run for the country's president in the 2001 general elections.
</P>
<P>
But incumbent President and MMD leader Frederick Chiluba, whose
second and last five-year term will expire in 2001, has indicated
that he will ensure that Mwila does not become the president and
MMD has said it is not the time to start the election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Mwila, one of the country's richest businessmen, helped Chiluba
defeat former President Kenneth Kaunda in the 1991 elections.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Georgian Defense Minister David
Tevnadze and deputy chief of the U.S. Defense Department Edward
Warner signed Thursday in Tbilisi an agreement on U.S. offering
great military aid for Georgia's accession to NATO, reports
reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is paying great attention to the process of the
Georgian army formation, and Georgia will receive considerable
help in this sphere, Warner told a news conference after the
accord was signed in Tbilisi, capital of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Georgia's Armed Forces will gradually meet the standards for a
membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in
three-five years, as the former Soviet republic is now past its
initial stage of fundamental military reforms and will comply with
NATO's military standards step by step, said Warner.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze said
after his re-election as head of state that his country will
strive for joining the North Atlantic alliance by 2005 when his
mandate expires.
</P>
<P>
However, Warner said the achievement of this objective will to
a great extent depend on Georgia's economic possibilities. He said
the U.S. is ready to render all sorts of help to the Georgian army,
but the Georgian government will have to solve specific problems.
</P>
<P>
Edward Warner told journalists that Washington intends to
consider helping Tbilisi establish a modern air defense system,
utilize and export military waste.
</P>
<P>
Warner's visit to Georgia will end Saturday.

<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Latin America and the Caribbean
received a little over 4 billion U.S. dollars in direct foreign
investment in the 1990s, which shows the growing importance the
region has gained as a platform for foreign investments, according
to a bulletin distributed Thursday here by the Latin American
Economic System (SELA).
</P>
<P>
The bulletin says that nowadays, direct foreign investing is
considered a key piece for financing the development of countries
and their insertion in the globalizing process, hence the
governments' interest to articulate their participation within
their national development strategies.
</P>
<P>
This matter will be object of wide analysis within the
framework of "Foreign Investments in Latin America and the
Caribbean: Experiences and Perspectives" forum, which will take
place in Caracas on June 29 and 30, convoked by the Permanent
Secretariat of Latin America's Permanent Secretariat (SELA).
</P>
<P>
According to figures by Spain's Ministry of Economy and
Treasury, in these years, annual flows of Spain's direct investing

dollars, concentrating on oil, telecommunication, banking and
electric energy sectors.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Mikhail
Kasyanov and Brazilian Vice President Marco Maciel signed here
Thursday an agreement on Russian-Brazilian partnership and a
program on joint actions of their governments to boost the
cooperation between the countries.
</P>
<P>
After the first session of the Russian-Brazilian Committee for
Cooperation at a high level here, the sides reached a package of
intergovernmental agreements on bilateral cooperation, including
the above-mentioned two key documents and a memorandum on exchange
of information about money laundering and other spheres, reported
Russia news agencies.
</P>
<P>
At the signing ceremony, Kasyanov emphasized that these
documents "provide an instrument for further cooperation between
the two countries."
</P>
<P>
The two sides outlined the priorities and spheres of further
cooperation. In particular, the parties discussed cooperation in
the fields of space and nuclear technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
Another theme of the meeting is the development of trade
relations, said the Russian premier, noting that the current
volume of the trade turnover between the two states is too small
though it has broad potentials.
</P>
<P>
An agreement was reached to set up a team to provide financial
support to the two nations' export in order to expand trade
relations, he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kasyanov stressed the importance of creating a
bilateral committee for cooperation at a high level, chaired by
the Russian prime minister and the Brazilian vice- president.
</P>
<P>
The parties agreed to hold the next session of the committee in
2002 and set a meeting of the Russia-Brazil Intergovernmental
Committee for Trade, Economic and Scientific Cooperation in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Kasyanov emphasized that the political dialogue between Russia
and Brazil "is at a very high level" and both countries "have
shared the position of a multi-polar world for many years."
</P>
<P>
He said Russia is ready to expand arms trade and related
cooperation with Brazil and such cooperation will be discussed
during the next session of bilateral commissions.
</P>
<P>
Maciel, who arrived in Moscow Thursday for a four-day visit,
said in his turn that Brazil is planning active cooperation with
Russia in space exploration, nuclear power engineering, aircraft
and ship building and the production of natural gas.
</P>
<P>
The Russian-Brazilian trade turnover stands at one billion U.S.
dollars annually, but most of Russia's imports have been sugar and
coffee, with raw sugar amounting to 75 percent of the revenues,
Maciel said.
</P>
<P>
He described the potential for bilateral economic cooperation
as very great and called for working out balanced
intergovernmental programs.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Unveils Plans for Web-Based Software Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft unveiled Thursday
the vision for its next generation of software and services, aimed
at making its existing software available over the Web to
traditional PCs and to new devices such as cell phone and personal
digital assistants.
</P>
<P>
Capitalizing on the explosion of Internet-based computing and
communications, the new set of products and services, under the
umbrella name Microsoft.Net, will provide easier, more
personalized and more productive Internet experiences by
harnessing constellations of small devices and Web sites with
advanced software through Internet protocols and formats.
</P>
<P>
The new initiative is part of Microsoft's goal of keeping
Windows the dominant operating system, even as computing begins to
move from desktop PCs toward Internet-enabled wireless devices.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft chairman Bill Gates said that the goal of the plan is
to connect every computing device and tie them to the Internet.
All data will be synchronized, allowing consumers and workers to
access the Internet, e-mail, calendars and important files,
regardless of what device they're using.
</P>
<P>
"The impact of the Internet has been spectacular to date, but
the pace of innovation will accelerate over the next five years,"
Gates said. "Our goal is to move beyond today's world of
standalone Web sites to an Internet of interchangeable components
where devices and services can be assembled into cohesive, user-
driven experience."
</P>
<P>
He said that "we have an opportunity to take this vision," but
his company faces a field of competitors such as IBM and Sun
Microsystems who have been pushing similar software-as-service
platforms.
